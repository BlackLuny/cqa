iLHm6iZPaa	I know it can be dissapointing when you find out your not pregnant. I tried for about 4 months before falling pregnant. I just stopped thinking about it and enjoyed have sex with my husband and we are now 17 weeks. As to your most fertile days, well that can be hard to predict. I would have sex as often as i could , from when you finish your period to when you think it will come again. Dont stress. it will happen  Good luck hope this helps|`|VFEjLgvuaa	whatever you do dont stress about it as it will make it very hard to concieve as several studies have shown beyond a doubt. Also keep faith and dont worry so much about it. If you and your partner neither one have any problems with fertility then it will happen. Enjoy trying and dont stress about it. Anytime I tried to get pregnant and stressed about it I never succeeded but when I "gave up" and "quit trying" it would happen as the added stress of trying and not getting results can actually make it almost impossible to concieve. So, enjoy "trying" and dont stress about it also you dont neccesarily ovulate every month. Dont try and pinpoint a time of month that you are fertile as it varies so much that its almost impossible to do without using an ovulation and conception kit. Just make love as much as you can enjoy it and dont worry or stress and I guarentee you unless you or your mate have fertility problems that it will happen maybe not sooner than later but you will eventually succeed. I was told I would never be able to get pregnant and if I did I wouldnt be able to carry the babies. I now have 4 beautiful children and have had 7 pregnancies. My first 2 pregnancies I was on bed rest the majority if not the entire time I was with child but I succeeded in bringing very beautiful and for the most part healthy babies into the world and my life. My 3 I lost were hard to bear as I always wanted a big family and if I had a rich hubby would never stop having children. I lost one at 6 wks one at 7 wks and one at 5 and a half months which was the hardest because I could feel him and was attached to him and after I lost him I even produced milk in my breasts. That was the hardest thing Ive ever had to go through but in the long run I got 4 beautiful awesome healthy happy loving babies and children and would have loved to have more but I got my tubes tied after losing the 3rd child due to the fact I knew I couldnt deal with the emotional pain of it again. so I guess what Im trying to say is if its meant to be no matter what the circumstances (like supposedly not being able to have children) it will happen and you will become a very happy and loving mommy. Also, due to the fact that you have tried so hard for so long that when it does happen you will be more appreciative and will love that child all that much more and be all that much more thankful and happy. Good luck I hope this helped you a little bit. Im sure that you will get the baby you so long for its just a matter of time.|`|Ad80gv2Daa	have you purchased the ovulation monitor? If not i would recommend it. It times you just right because it can determine your bodies LH levels. Giving you the closest two days for you to have sex. Also remember sperm can live for 72 hours.

4DoXomHZaa	A non-hormonal IUD works by preventing implantation. It does not prevent ovulation.    Those, once removed, do not affect fertility. You return to normalcy immediately.     If you have a hormonal IUD, they say it takes about one full cycle.    You have a 20% shot any month for fertile couples.

dzyJw0cvaa	LOL, my first one decided to be concieved when i was sixteen...i'm pretty sure it happened on Thanksgiving. *wink wink*  But she was induced and came on a great day that i chose.  My second one however was a different story!  I married the father of my first and we got pregnant with our second about three years later.  His due date was November 12 and i was scheduled to have him induced on November 9th. Well, he had plans of his own and he came on the opening morning of deer hunting.  I dont hunt, but my husband goes every year, no matter what, i soon found out.  i went in to labor around 2am and my husband left anyway with a phone by my side  at five am "just in case".  (He REALLY loves deer hunting.)  well, fifteen minutes later i called him and said we need to go to the hospital and he says, "Youre kidding me!" A few hours later i had our son and my husband went out hunting all afternoon and all week on his paternity leave.  (Yes, we are divorced now.  He wasnt such a good papa or spouse!)     So yeah, while it was fine timing for me, my husband at the time was not thrilled at all.  His brother shot a buck from my husbands stand that morning while i was giving birth and he never let me live it down, as if i had any choice in the matter!!|`|6avKnzkoaa	Well this story was from my mum about me. She had her first weekly appointment and then the next day she had me. However, the lead up to it was eventful.    She was cleaning the kitchen and everything when she started getting pain and bleeding slightly. So she asked my uncle to go and find a telephone (because at that time, they just moved in and the phone lines weren't connected yet). So my uncle had to run around the neighbourhood to find a phone to call my dad.    Anyways when they got there the doctor was like "Go to the delivery ward to have the baby". So my dad drove my mum to the delivery ward. The midwives there said that my mum hadn't need to deliver yet as it was just BH and the show. But my mum's doctor decided to break her waters anyways. So after they broke her waters I still wasn't ready to come out and she wasn't getting any contractions. So the doctor told her that they'll deliver tomorrow.     Then later that afternoon, because the doctor had no calls, decided that he didn't want to wait and deliver me that afternoon. But since I wasn't ready to come out, they had to use forceps and the suction thing to get me out. So I was a coneheaded baby born 3 weeks early.|`|e4aF8tdPaa	i was suppose to be born around april 24th.....my mom had a doctors appointment in march and she was still working. she went to the doctor went home for lunch and went back to work. next thing you know my grandmother called her and told her the doctor wanted her to come back to his office...i was born march 18th|`|TQW5E6olaa	My mom went into labor with me so she called me dad to come home and get her.

Mine was boring. My last day of work was Friday, I had found out on Monday my baby was still breech and refused to move so the doctor booked the OR for Tuesday So, knowing I would have my baby later that day, I got ready at a leisurely pace, blew out my hair, did my makeup, and stopped for cupcakes for Bella's "birthday" for the staff and waddled into the hospital.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	My cousin was born under an overpass in a car cause he wouldn't wait.

gzaVGE4Qaa	As far as I know a hospital can't drug test you. That's how crack babies are made without the parent having legal issues.     I know a girl who shot heroin all through her pregnancy (and after while she was breast feeding), she makes me sick - and the state took her baby, yay!     Please seek treatment if you're on drugs and pregnant.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Probably most illegal drugs. And I think that most if not all states do test.     This is to make sure you aren't endangering your baby. If you are found positive for something that is illegal. Chances are social services will be called when you give birth and the baby will be taken away.|`|SkMjo0fNaa	Most states don't drug test you unless it's been reported that you are taking drugs while preggers. If it hasn't been reported this pregnancy (or any past pregnancies) then you should never be asked to get tested. Unless you are in a drug program then I don't think this should be an issue. CPS can force you to get randomly drug tested if you've had children taken away from you in the past for drug related problems.    Sadly even it if it reported they don't always test the person, those tests are expensive.|`|7ktbbv2Maa	tennesse is one of them because when i got pregnant with my twins they did it and if they found drugs in your system and after the baby is born you are going to jail|`|qgL98Wv2aa	here in texas ALL babies are tested at birth for every illegal drug known and if the baby is 'dirty' CPS is brought in ASAP the mother is forced to be tested too then depending on the type of drug or/and amount CPS moves forward from there in some cases it's constant visitations to the doctor, drug counseling and never allowed being alone with the child ( the parents) until it is determined that they successfully completely the course......

That sounds fair.  Sure it does.  Why don't you guys both do some of it when she gets home, so that you both get some rest.  Don't try to dump it all on her once she walks in the door.  That's just harsh.    As for writing your script, you can do that after the kid goes to sleep, and when you have down time during the day.  You have a much more flexible schedule than your wife, so cut her some slack.  She is the one that is working right now.  She is the one with a fixed schedule.  You can run around all day in your bunny slippers, she can't.  Writing is not something that MUST be done between 9-5 M-F.  It is something that you can do when you have an hour here or there, or late at night.  Trust me.  I know.  And yes, I have been published several times.  So I am not totally ignorant when it comes to the nuts and bolts of it.    With regards to the diapers, generally every 2 hours is good.  More if they need to be changed, less if the diaper is still dry.|`|LBQ50RnKaa	everytime your kid uses the bathroom duh|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Yes.  You should still continue to help out for awhile after she has come home.  At least give her some time to relax a little when she first comes in.  If she comes in from working all day and you immediately dump the responsibility of caring for the child on her, she will be resentful towards you.  Just like you feel as though you have been working all day while watching your daughter, she feels like this is work too.  However, she is just coming from work.  Give her time to unwind.  After she has done this and has had sufficient time to completely relax, explain to her that you would like to go and work on your script and would appreciate her taking care of the baby while you do so.  Say something nice before you leave (ie-- call me if you need me to do anything).  This will let her know that you haven't just resigned for the rest of the evening, that you are understanding that she has needs to and you are being sensitive to this fact.  This should help you to be able to keep the peace.|`|RsXCY7wuaa	if your not working it is your job to care for your child. when you wife gets back from work you should let her rest for a while then alternate the diaper duty or what ever chores

3X0Lsk5caa	Ok, it's "abnormal pap," and I'm not sure what the question is.... I had a colposcopy done at the beginning of my pregnancy because I have had a few cancer scares, and everything was fine. As far as the HPV, it shouldn't effect your pregnancy at all. If you have an outbreak of any sort, they will do a c-section so that the baby doesn't come into contact with it and become infected. Other than that, you are just looking at a normal pregnancy. Your doctor will keep an eye on you to make sure your cells aren't turning cancerous.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	there is no such thing as BAD normal PAP    it's either a normal or abnormal PAP    HPV and being pregnant is fine, it's a very LOW LOW LOW LOW or no risk at all to your baby.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	condoms would have prevented most of your problems.  make better choices & be sure your OB is the best.

A topical anesthetic (amla?) is applied a few hours before the procedure, and your baby will not feel a thing as long as you apply enough.  Healing is just a few days when the ring and skin falls off.  The doctor cannot take too much with this method either.  Do plenty of research to find a good doctor.      30% of boys require it done at a later stage if not done at birth.  My family work in geriatric care and have to send loads of old men to have it done too because they can't keep themselves clean as they age and the smegma (terrible name) builds up and causes infection.    Not sure which country you are from but circumcision is no longer covered by Medicare in Australia.      Most parents tend to follow what the childs Dad looks like.    Don't worry about the fitting in issue.  Teen boys just don't care.  It is more about how many pubes you have!

Harriet|`|q1YDp1y3aa	The fitting in reason is over rated. Nationwide, only 50% of baby boys are being circumcised, so there will be plenty of intact peers. Even if you live in a high circ area- are you SURE you'll live there in 15 years? And maybe your son will move elsewhere. In some parts of the country, only 30% of boys his age will be cut, and in all other developed countries, the number of cut boys is lower still. In any case, if anyone makes fun of his penis, all he needs to do is announce that so and so is looking and his penis to get it to stop, No teenager wants to be caught looking at another guy. I also don't think conformity is a good reason for anything, much less irreversible and painful genital surgery. You know the saying, if everyone else jumped off a bridge... If you educate your son about his body and the benefits of being intact, he should weather the relatively short adolescent years well. after all in the big picture, they are only a very, very small portion of his life. It could save him potential teasing for a few years of his life, but he has to live with his penis for hopefully 70 or more years. Here's some more info-     I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.    Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?    Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/  http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2... (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)    You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...    You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)    Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....  http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...    Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...    The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. http://www.icgi.org/    It is rather eye-opening to see how circu|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	As far as "fitting in" I don't think guys stand around and compare their penises.     They say it is more healthy to get it done but my husband isn't circumcised and he has never had any problems. I have wanted to get it done to our son because I have heard of people that didn't get it done to their infant and their poor son had to get it done at the age of 10 when it hurt much more... but my husband is adamantly against it.    I said if our son has to get it done later in life he needs to do it right along with him but I'm guessing that won't happen. ;)|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	We did NOT circumcise our son and never would to any future son.  It is genital mutilation and we are against it.  Actually now the percentage is like close to 50/50 as far as circumcised and uncircumcised.

I am so glad he wasn't too, as is he.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	No.  No one in my family is, see no reason to do it.  Boys don't stand around with their penises hanging out seeing who is different and who isn't.  Changing in locker rooms don't require underwear coming off as there are no showers after gym class.  The rate of circumscision is going down in the united states, and many insurance companies list it as a comestic surgery and won't cover it.      Yes..my nephew played football, he never showered at the school after the games, ever.  And apparently he wasn't the only one. Lots of kids would rather ride around stinky then shower with other people, and as far as I know they werenever forced, and a teacher can't force a kid to shower if they don't want too.

It desentisitises the penis as the foreskin is meant to cover the glands. with it gone the glands rubs on clothing and becomes less sensitive this may cause sex to be less pleasurable.   And as for fitting in. here in my country (new zealand) you would be the odd one out if you were circumsized. It is very very rare for a boy to be circumsized here. I think even in the us it is getting less common so dont worry while there may be circumsized boys in the locker room Im sure he wont be the only uncut one.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I don't think it's necessary and if my baby is a boy I don't want him to be circumsized although my husband does.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Circumcise.  It is cleaner in the long run.|`|LhvKTYftaa	yes, IMO.    this will be a debate so I'll just say yes if you want to, no if you're not sure.  You cant undo it|`|qgL98Wv2aa	it may depend on your religion many do it for that sole reason....which i did with my eldest son but i also wanted to be there to see the procedure done and when i did i almost fainted so i didn't do my other two sons......and as far as the long term effect just teach them to keep it clean and so far no complaints from their girlfriends and two grandchildren and counting      LET'S RODEO SAN ANTONIO  YEEEE.....HAAA|`|47b56e7446888d86d8acbefdbb1a37a5aa	No. If you're worried about him fitting in when he's older I think you'll find that these days it's more uncommon to be circumcised.|`|v6Ehreizaa	I have two sons and have gone both ways.  My oldest son is circumcised.  My youngest isn't.  If someone had told me exactly what they were going to do to my oldest son, he wouldn't be circumcised.  I was horrified after they brought him back to me and showed me his penis.  I will never inflict that kind of pain on a child again.|`|sbedPdLDaa	I say yes, because of hygiene. Also, there are studies that show circumcision can help prevent certain cancers and illnesses as well.      It's your choice of course, and they can always do it at a later age, but if it were my child I would say yes.|`|SYRqxCMDaa	I am getting my son circumcised next week.    I personally think that uncircumcised penis' are not attractive. my husband thinks the same. he would have felt weird growing up if he was not. so ill spare him the grief of being "different" in the later years.     yeah my ob is doing it and she said that most dr.s don't give anesthesia when they do it but she does. how mean!|`|wnVGeG8uaa	I believe in circumcision and I think its better to be done as an infant rather then a child. The healing process would take longer if they were older and the procedure would be much more simple as an infant.|`|b5JnSBstaa	Its a very personal decision between the 2 parents.  My husband and I chose to have our son circumsized before we left the hospital. It took about 15 minutes and then they were done. My son came back into our room and looked totally fine.  My husband just really wanted our son to be clean and hygenic and also to look like him.
cnp21qZJaa	well it usually takes 3 days for sperm to fertilize. no one shows symptoms 2 days after. it usually takes weeks!|`|xhcDkCwcaa	She could be pregnant but if she was she would not be feeling these symptoms yet. Wait a couple weeks and are if her breasts are sore and if she is still sick or if her period is missed.
AA11927140	I'm sorry... I'm just confused: were you pregnant?  In other words, were you aware of a pregnancy before all this began?  First, dark brown / brown usually indicates "old" blood.  If pregnant, this is the "least" worrisome type.  As for "stringy", I have no idea.  Very dark red discharge accompanied with cramps could have been a miscarriage... or an especially tough cycle.  Don't know what you mean by "got a pouch"... ?  I'm sorry I am not more helpful.  If you were pregnant, it does sound like it may very well have been a miscarriage.  If that is the case, please get to a doctor asap, as you should never use a tampon during a miscarriage.  (High risk of infection, etc.)  Also not sure which pregnancy symptoms you are referring to- ?  I wish you the very best.  Good luck.|`|AA12016833	Sometimes women have miscarriage and continue to have pregnancy symptoms because some of the tissues have not passed, and the body continues to produce hCG. You should really see a doctor as soon as you can.|`|IllWKAUGaa	It could have been, and you'd still be having symptoms because the hormones take a while to leave your body...you should goto the ER...
fCcwvZS3aa	I know exactly what you are going through.  My son who just turn 4 has been potty trained for about 4 months. I worked with him consistently for it seemed like forever, which it was almost 1 year. What I finally did was, I went and bought a waterproof mattress pad, and told him that he wasn't allowed to wear diapers or pull-ups anymore, and that if he went to the potty without and accidents that I would make him a cake (he loves cake). And after a few weeks it worked, and we have been accident free for over 3 months now. Maybe you can take from my experience and get yourself a potty trained boy too. :)|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Potty training takes time with boys.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I just went threw this about 3 months ago with my 2 and a half son. When he went we sung the potty song[my son is named Liam]. It went "Liam went pee pee on the potty, the potty" and you danced up and down. We tried rewarding like if you went pee all week, the we would go to Wendy's for lunch or go to the park. It works!!|`|Cdp02p0Xaa	WTF?|`|sw2R5A9iaa	relax -his body needs a couple more years to fully mature before he can control his bowel/bladder habits.  encourage & take some parenting classes.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Is he letting you know when he is wet? Is he trying to take off his wet diaper? These are signs that he is ready to train. I would suggest you take a break and get back to it when he is showing the signs that he is ready. You can also go to the library and read him some kid potty books.|`|sFGgPTk3aa	You could try backing off for a month or so and then see if he exhibits signs of being ready.  I made my daughter change her own wet panties and she really didn't like that. The poop is harder though.  Maybe if you back off he will decide on his own that he wants to do it.  Or if there is a toy that he REALLY wants, tell him that toy is only for big boys who use the potty.  This worked for one of my cousins kids.  Once she used the potty consistently she got the toy.  Just some suggestions..hope they help.|`|AEclTchGaa	you still go potty train ha ha are you a baby or what.|`|C00vT3y4aa	i have two boys myself... 6 and almost 3. the older didn't potty train until he turned 3. not sure how old exactly your son is but it may just be a good time to lay off the whole potty training. I started training my son when he was 2-21/2  and finally gave up (per my pediatrician's advice) after 6 mths. that is when he surprised us and went potty by himself!! boys take longer than girls I hear so I haven;t even started my youngest son who turns 3 in June yet. I will wait until he shows me signs of wanting to use the potty. It's just not worth the stress it puts you thru. Hope that helps!|`|NnR7n8vVaa	Hi  Sounds like my number one son! The answer I found is really easy - Just back off for 6 or 8 weeks. Put him back in diapers and simply don't hassle him at all. Maybe he will even start to self-train if there's no pressure. Whatever, you probably both need to rest and enjoy each other without getting hung up on what (in time! ) will seem like a very small issue. When you start again keep it all really low key. No punishments. The only reward is being a big boy. No sitting for long periods. Some boys can be almost four or so before they are consistently ready to toilet train. Don't listen to grandparents etc who tell you how early they trained their kids. You simply can't discipline a kid into using the toilet.   PS 'strong willed' is good as your child grows up. My boy is one of the nicest people I know - despite driving me mad as a youngster.|`|LExdUnPsaa	ok well first of all do not put him in regular underpants this only makes a bigger mess for you rememberr he is only three so it might take a bit for him to fully understand the hole concept try rewarding him buy doing somthing he likes buy taking him out to see a movie maby make sure he has used the potty for at least four days then tell him he has earned his prize let him no you are proud of him even if it takes a wile be pationt good luck remeber these are all just suggestionsyou are the mother not me
a8lsETxHaa	I believe Amazon will ship internationally, but they use USPS which means no tracking, shipping or delivery confirmation. Also it will take 2 -3 weeks to get to Australia with regular postal service.    I would suggest looking into a company called http://www.BongoUS.com . They set you up with a US Address you can ship to, then they fwd onto you in AU. For the Kota it may be pricey, I think that toy weighs like 30 lbs! But it's a great service and worth checking into. You can shipping get estimates on their page, etc.
AA11885437	Like a metallic type taste? That happened to me, and I think its pretty common. Chalk it up to hormones. They do crazy things.|`|v6Ehreizaa	I had a wierd salty taste in my mouth around that time and it turned out to be pre-eclampysia.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Could be your prenatal vitamins, oh god my left this horrible taste in my mouth finally after about a few weeks of taking them I cracked and bought some over the counter at walmart and they are wonderful my doctor gave me the clear to take them and all my levels are coming back normal.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	It didn't happen to me, but people do get food aversions.  Is it with everything?  Or do you crave weird things?  Your whole body changes during pregnancy, and it's probably nothing, but it could also be a sign of something.  If it is in fact everything, or even if it isn't I would just bring it up to your OB.  Good Luck, and Congrats!|`|GNtsdk4saa	Mine was the smell of our soap.  Every time I showered, I almost gagged.  It's your ultra-sensitive sense of smell.  Try mixing a little bit of lemon in the water, or lime.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I hope you mean when you drink water!   Drink Gatorade or Diet Rite instead, it's not uncommon to have an aftertaste - not fun but it happens.  Or think about getting your teeth cleaned.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	The first trimester I had a metallic taste in my mouth all the time. I tried changing toothpaste, mouthwash, all of my eating habits - nothing change it. As soon as I hit my second trimester it went away just as if someone hit a switch. Hang in there!!!|`|3e638d6ab3495c81d3dddc1fcb75f972aa	never found out what it was but i had it with both my girls but not my son ?? i used to drink orange juice as it tastes the same coming up as it did going down. . nasty i know but thats all i can offer you, good luck x
PRzmwFfgaa	Sucks for the mom.  Why would any woman, no matter what country she is from, let a man leave the country with her child like that?|`|AA11684972	That's why you must think very hard about marrying outside your race/culture/or country. Both parents deserve to see their child (as long as they are good parents). I think its very sad when one parent takes the child and runs away. As an American woman, I'd be upset with either choice. I married an American man and am very happy I'll not have to ever deal with that issue.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Neither one sounds all that appealing.  Having a very good home or good fathers won't make either mother feel better about the situation.    So what is the question you are asking?  The situations are exactly the same, regardless of the nationality.  It's doubtful American mothers feel that the second scenario is any better then the first.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	I would feel horrible for the American mother. There's got to be something the government could do!

She is better now. Yea it got worse before it got better. its pretty serious when anyone gets that.. I felt so sorry for her with all those tubes hooked up to her|`|IkkYOehSaa	my daughter currently has RSV. She was diagnosed with it last week. They started her on A nebulizer. And the next day she was already better. They caught it very early because I was concerned with her breathing. Thankfully no hospital visit or anything like that. She had a visit today for a check up and her lungs were clear and she was just congested in her nose, but she is also teething. As far I as I know it can last a few weeks. Just keep a very close on him. Keep him warm and use the medication and treatments as doctors says. If he develops a fever call the doctor immediately. It is good if he caoughs, it;s clears the lungs. Good luck. Also use the Johnsons & Johnsons vapor bath. It works great.|`|1S5AbPueaa	Yes my first son had RSV when he was 6 months.The Dr put him on antibiotics and breathing treatments.I cannot remember how long it took to go away,but I do remember that the breathing treatments made him cough more and it seemed like he was getting worse.His Dr said it was good for him to cough more because he was coughing up all the mucous in his lungs.  I think my son was on breathing treatments for 2 weeks also he got xr ayed but did not need to be hospitalized.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Wow! You must be reading my mind! Our 8 month old was diagnosed with pneumonia Saturday night. Right now I am on the cusp of taking him back to the ER and demanding he be admitted. We are having a hard time controlling the wheezing... (He's getting a lot of breathing treatments) The Doctor gave us a steroid today though so I'll give it 24 hours to kick in.     So I guess in our case it is getting worse but I know it'll get better... he took his third dose of antibiotic today so it has to start breaking up soon...    --------------------------------------...  Does he have RSV or Pneumonia?|`|sw2R5A9iaa	keep all hands clean & use the bulb syringe with saline drops liberally.  run a vaporizer when the babe is at home.
a12cbnR4aa	Why don't you go live with your mom?    Edit: Maybe you need to talk to your mom. She can fight for you. There is no reason you shouldn't be able to do your laundry at your dad's house...where you live. You are 15 and you need a social live. Stand up for yourself and explain to your mom your living conditions with your dad. Its kind of sad that your dad lets your step-mom treat you like that.     Best of Luck.|`|oHSzktF4aa	Have you tried talking to your Dad and step-mom about what you think is wrong?    Edit:  At the age of 12 you are LEGALLY allowed to choose which parent you want to live with, regardless of what your mother of father says. If your dad doesn't like it, and you really want to leave, tell him to go away and move in with your mom.    At least that's what the laws were back when I was a child. I don't know if the laws have changed, but I am 99% sure you are allowed to choose who you want to live with.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	My mom let me do whatever I wanted, as long as I asked first.  The only thing was a curfew.    That's pretty strict.  I'd hate that.  You can't live with your mom?  You can't call social services either...  As hard as it sounds, maybe you could stop whining and deal with it? Or you could find another family member to live with?  My cousin has lived with so many people because she just couldn't deal with the constant rules, and had to get out. You don't want that.
OgzHcNMsaa	If you are...then so am I...kidding. My daughter is 3 weeks. When I took her for her first dr visit at 1 week, the dr said to feed her 2-3 oz every 2-3 hrs. Basically  it works out to an oz every hour is what my dr said is fine for her. So I don't think you are. It seems perfect.|`|NH2Yg2x3aa	That's about how much I fed my daughter at that age. Did  the doctors say she was overweight or are you just overly concerned? I'd bet to say that she's fine.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	If that's what she's eating, and she's okay, not being fussy, or spitting up a lot, then I think it's fine.  I mean it does sound like a lot, all though all babies are different, they say 2 to 2.5 ounces per pound, but my little girl doesn't follow that, she actually eats less, but like I said all babies are different.  But if she isn't doing well, then I would limit it, some babies will over eat, because they want to suck on something not because they're actually hungry.  Your her mom, you can tell, just go with your gut!|`|HNLskA4Aaa	.. i think you are. Babies are very mandable, so you really must be careful with them with their body, and such. Unless your baby WANTS more food, try and cut down.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	At two weeks old, feed her whenever shes hungry!    I don't remember how much my kids actually consumed at that age, but, when they were babies - they nursed practically every hour sometimes day & night!!!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	if you feed on demand, the diet is perfect.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	If you are feeding your baby every two hours it sounds like the formula is not strong enough for the baby there fore ifshe was getting a stronger formula it would be more filling and she wouldn't be eating as often|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	It really depends on if she is hungry or not. She is still really young, so all babies that age do are eat, poop, and sleep. If she is eating that much, feed her that much. I'd wean her from that little amount that often (try 4 oz every 2-3 hours) as she gets older. If you are concerned, just ask the doctor.|`|pmrKsxHTaa	No hon, you aren't.  My son was eating 4 ounces every 2.5 hours when he was that age.  I asked my pediatrician if that was bad for him, and he told me that babies will eat until they aren't hungry.  She wont eat unless she is hungry, and she will eat until she is full.  I don't think you are doing anything wrong, but if you have any questions you should ask your pediatrician.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	Sometimes it's hard for a new mom to know when her child is hungry, so stop jumping down her throat for asking a question!!!!!!!!    **************************************...    Your baby will let you know if it's too much (formula I assume...?)  Contrary to what you've probably been told, formula fed babies DO NOT always overeat.  Watch to see if your baby tries to push the nipple out of her mouth, or seems to be spitting up a lot after a feeding (after you've burped her).    Some signs of hunger are: turning her head towards your breast, sucking motions, fussiness.    Good luck!|`|sbedPdLDaa	i feed mine 2 ounces every 3 hours and she is 12 days. However, sometimes it seems like she wants more, or she will start crying before the 3 hours, and wont stop until I feed her. I think alot of it has to to w/ there weight. I told my doc how much I fed my baby at her 1 week apt.. which was the same I am doing now, and she said that that was very good. My baby was born at 8 pounds 1 ounce. So I would ask your pediatrition to make sure... babies digestive systems aren't complete when they are born, and you wouldn't want to over work them.|`|tA7WDLm4aa	if she's eating it and not getting sick than it's fine.  At that age you feed them when they are hungry. I think my son ate that way at that age and I started giving him a little more each feeding so that he could go longer in between.  He was fine and the doctor said it was fine also.
sFGgPTk3aa	Talk to your pediatrician immediately and don't take her back to the daycare until you find out for sure.  Your pediatrician can examine her externally and if he/she suspects she has been molested may refer you to a place that specializes in child molestation.  I don't know what state you are in but in Nebraska they have Project Harmony and the kids only undergo one examination that is well documented by people specially trained.  I hope this is not what is going on with your daughter.  Also you didn't mention how old, but maybe she has a urinary tract infection.  Good luck!!|`|QictQpZzaa	oh she's just teasing you|`|dYmLGsN0aa	Does she often act scared of situations and people? If not this is probably significant.  There could there be a chance that someone at the daycare took her to the potty and she just had a painful urine or BM? HOWEVER, not worth taking a chance on taking her back there until you find out via the doctor method recommended by others on this site.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	take her to the doc to get checkout. it could be that or she could have a urine infection.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes, have her get a pelvic exam by her pediatrician!   It'll be pretty obvious to the doctor what's going on.|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	It sounds like something is going on,i f this has just started happening . I would take her to doctor and get her looked at to make sure everything is alright.|`|qGOxMYpHaa	those are really all signs of molestation or something is definately going on.  i'd go over to the local police station and ask them on tips on how to be sure.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Know for sure? I think your daughter is doing everything short of drawing you a diagram! Get her to a doctor to get looked at!!|`|HNLskA4Aaa	Ask her simple questions that wont seem so obvious. Like " why are you scared?" And if you can, you should consult with a docter to check her body. If you really are being suspicious, i suggest you switch daycares. If she is, then slowly convince her the wrongs of touching her in good ways, and bad ways. Like huggings, and when she is young, parents can give her baths.|`|JdqDauEDaa	I think she is spelling it out for you. Take her to a doctor to be checked.|`|AA12144686	Take her to the dr, they can check her and see if her labia is torn, with a small child it doesnt take much for it to tear. they would be able to tell you|`|3X0Lsk5caa	DO NOT PRESS THIS ISSUE. Take her to a professional where they can help her. If you pressure her or scare her, she won't be honest about what happened. I am so sorry that you have to worry about this. The only thing you can do is take her to a psychologist/psychiatrist and let them handle it. I would also speak to the daycare, and even look into finding another one asap. Good luck.

t1fx6kXcaa	This is not rocket science. You buy fresh vegetables. You cook healthy nutritious meals with grains, legumes etc. Meals such as curries and stews. You freeze them. Freezing has little impact on the vitamin and mineral content of vegetables. Do you realise that "fresh" fruit and vegetables have often been in frozen storage (for up to 8 months) before they hit the supermarket shelves? Do you realise that keeping your fruit and veg in the fridge for even just a few days has an impact on the antioxidant, vitamin and mineral content? Those who buy groceries once a month usually also buy fruit, milk and salad vegetables every week. They do the BIG grocery shop once a month.   In order to have truly FRESH fruit and vegetables, you would need to grow them yourself and consume them straight away. Even your caring rural produce store manager wouldn't be picking the fruit and veg himself and discarding what didn't sell after two days. Transport, storage all have an impact on produce.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I remember seeing a question the other day about grocery shopping once a month and I though the same thing, what about fresh fruits and veggies.  I was gonna answer but didn't have time.     Sadly most families live off of fast food and premade frozen dinners.  Its no surprise obesity rates have high an all time high.    I think its sad that parents would compromise there child's health for convenience.  I know several people that live off a big mac and fries every day.    We are at the grocery store once a week stocking up on fresh produce for our son and ourselves.  We still need fresh produce even though I can and freeze alot of veggies that my family grows on their organic farm.  In the summers, luckily I hardly ever have to grocery shop.  I can my own tomato's, salsa, green beans, pickles, and jam.  I freeze my own zucchini, corn, bell peppers, jalapenos, carrots, peas and berries, yet we still find ourselves craving a fresh apple or banana or an avocado.  The US diet is extremely sad.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	a lot of people do 1 giant grocery shopping a month and then run to the store for incidentals.|`|9PqAOQu1aa	I do buy fresh fruits and veggies almost every week, but I do like frozen veggies as well.  I know people who eat canned fruits and veggies, but I'm not a fan.    I get huge bags of frozen broccoli, peas and corn and keep them in the deep freeze.  Microwave a bowl of them for 5 minutes and they are delish.  Much better than nasty canned veggies.    EDIT:  I love those pictures from TIME!  The first time I saw them, I stared at them forever, looking at the difference (and similarities!) in our food purchases and how different the prices were.  It really makes you think.  I try to buy less pre-packaged foods and go for more whole foods.  It doesn't always work for my crunched schedule, but I give it a go.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Maybe they do Bulk Food shopping once a month , and stock up on frozen groceries like Veggies , or get canned veggies and fruits. I personally couldn't do all canned and frozen veggies and fruits..But we do shop in bulk, but we do go about every week for that, half stays at home for Sarah & I , other half will go with Daddy to where he is staying for work.  But I do go to the store once  a week maybe every other week for the fresh goodies, like breads, dairy,fruits & veggies.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	I get a lot of bananas and apples and oranges. They will usually last longer than a week. As for vegtable i get carrots and celery and also sometimes frozen.  But, to go grocery shopping once a month would be too long of a stretch. I think we could maybe survive 2 weeks, but that is pushing it.|`|ZKHaLbdEaa	In the summer, we grow a lot of our vegetables and have swap meets with our tree-huggin' homies.  We shop at the store a few times a month to stock up on dry goods.  Does that count as an answer?    EDIT-ASTIC BOOMBASTICA:  In the winter, we grocery shop constantly.  It's hell on our car, but swell on our bellies.    I'm also obsessed with bok choy and ginger.    Okay bye.    Love Pimp Stain aka Betwixt|`|v6Ehreizaa	I buy all of my meats and pantry items once a month.  But I purchase my fresh fruits and veggies every week.  This way I only spend maybe 20 or 30 dollars weekly.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Normal, yes.  Healthy, no.  I shop at a major supermarket 1-2 times per month (canned goods, pasta & cleaning supplies).  Then I pick up fresh veggies, fruits and meat as needed throughout the week at local market stores and Whole Foods|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I imagine those who shop less than once a week or so either (1) have a diet very low in any types of fruits and veggies, or (2) use canned or frozen fruits and veggies instead.    We shop about once a week, but we don't buy a ton of fresh produce.  We can handle oranges, apples, and bananas well, but peaches, pears, pineapple, strawberries, are often "out of season", expensive, and of poor quality.  I know you are able to live in the sticks and still have a green grocer, but we get to live in the sticks with some pretty basic grocers.  Also, (don't think I'm horrible!), my hubby and I don't eat a ton of veggies.  Our toddler eats veggies really well, but we don't eat nearly as much as we should.  That means that any fresh veggie produce we buy often spoils because it's not super fresh when we buy it and because we don't eat it fast enough.  If I'm good, I'll dehydrate some carrots to add to stews etc, but I'm usually not that ambitious.    So, we buy a lot of frozen fruit and veggies, and a lot of canned fruits.  This lets us eat blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, and mango easily and healthily all year, and it lets us use all of the veggies we buy instead of throwing most of them out.    Edit:  Oops..  I'm sorry.  I, obviously, mis-remembered one of your previous comments.  But, I had the right idea, right?  :)|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	I make one big trip to Costco every month, and then weekly trips to the regular grocery store for other things I need. Most of the fruits and veggies I get from Costco last about 2 weeks, unless they're frozen.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Thanks to the link of the photos, that is fascinating.    We grocery shop every 1-2 weeks at the big store and I also make extra trips to a market with better produce.  We are at a grocery store, in some form, at least once a week.    We do supplement with frozen veggies though, that way we always have some on hand in case the store had crappy produce that week.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Living on a military base, literally 2 minutes from the commissary, I have no excuse not to have produce in my home each day.  So I do!  :)  I'd say we make big trips about once a week, maybe every 10 days, and smaller visits every 4-5 days, for produce.  I also have frozen fruits and veggies on hand, since in a pinch they are great to bake with, or add to casseroles and soups.  We don't buy canned veggies or fruits since I don't like the taste and texture overall, excepting beans on occasion.  They are great once rinsed, and can be added to quesadillas or salads.  I don't understand NOT eating fruits and veggies, never have.  My toddler and I love nibbling on raw carrots best!    **LOVE the Time photos; hadn't seen them in a long time.  Thanks!|`|LhvKTYftaa	Those pictures were great!!  I loved them, and literally (Like Nerdy) stared at them comparing...cool stuff.    I (having just returned from Safeway to get bananas and apples) buy fresh produce 1-2 times a week (as needed).  I do however use frozen veggies both for us and for baby man.  He does love his asparagus!  i must confess as well, I am a HUGE frozen fruit fan!  As in I eat a bow of it for dessert (and occasionally a snack) almost nightly.  It's like ice cream but better!  That being said, since I live right next door to BC, come summer don't even think about bringing any fruit or veg in my house that has not come from the Okanagan, or the farmers market!!  Nothing beats a BC peach!!|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Not all people eat fresh fruit/vegetables.  They do make frozen vegetables and fruit.  It's personal preference.  Maybe that particular person doesn't eat fruit and vegetables.|`|9Gd231Qqaa	I go shopping about every other week.  For fruits and veggies you learn which ones last longer.  for example: Baby carrots last longer than a week, so you get those and eat those the second week.  Also, we have a good crisper in our fridge and fruits and veggies last a lot longer than normal.  It is some trial and error, but you do learn.|`|AA11981363	I buy fresh produce once a week, fruits and vegetables. My country is still depends lots on its own agricultural produce, and you can buy fresh anything almost everywhere. Here, I have 3 different greengrocers just about 10 Min's away (one is only 4 Min's away walking) and I actually enjoy going there and picking out my fruits and veggies. I can't eat frozen ones, only on very few occasions I buy/use the stuff for cooking. When I lived in the States I was amazed at how everything is sold packed/processed. I had never in my life seen anything like it, may I add I also gained 45lbs in the years and so that I lived there...my kitchen would look like the mexican one or the egyptian one. Very clear cultural differences there.|`|0vx7j8klaa	When you are getting food stamps you have to go to the store once a month.  That was me in the pass and now.  I lost my job so I had to go back and get food stamps.  Yes I go to the store once a month.  You have to  buy the right things when you go.  I buy lot's of veggies.  And I try not to buy lot's of meat. Meat takes a long time  to digest.  But I try to save some of the food stamps just in case I may need something else doing the week.  But have you notice that in some of the photos that the family's have lot's of veggies. That is something that we all need.  Veggie is fiber, and good for you.   Like little kids most of them don't like veggies.  So mom have to make them eat them.  I know of people that don't eat veggies at all and that is not good.  With $176.00 a month in stamps I do good for 2 people.  But I would say to each is own.  Everybody don't per pair there meals the same way.     That is a good web site.  May God bless you  Mary r.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	I go twice a month to refill my pantry then I go every Monday {fresh shipment} for all my produce. We just went vegetarian so it's been interesting trying so many yummy "new" veggies. The frozen just can't compare although I do sometimes buy it if the fresh version isn't looking good. And I only use canned if I'm making a stew or chowder. If your looking for some great casserole and soup ideas just email me. As long as you don't mind vegetarian food :) But you can always add meat if want.|`|dp7VR8BJaa	I find myself shopping for fresh produce at least weekly, though I have started buying more fruit/veggies in bulk and making soups with it or putting them in Debbie Meyer Green bags-which really do work and keep stuff fresh for a couple of weeks.    Thank you for the very interesting link.|`|bWu4p5OBaa	I do groceries every wk or every 2 wks.    I eat a lot of frozen veggies.    Thanks for the link to the Times pics.    That was so neat to see.     Breaks my heart to see that family from Africa Chad have so little to eat.    Really gross to see how many bottles of Coke people drink! I hate pop( no offense if you drink it) but that one family had like 10 bottles...wow! I'm more concerned about that then fresh veggies lol !|`|UghJ0XROaa	We do one huge order a month, pick up milk, eggs and bread as needed and get our fresh fruits and vegetable from the local flea market. There it is locally grown and not shipped from across country.
yHlWHB1Yaa	I know this answer is obvious, however, just ignore them.  They're snobs and they have money. That doesn't give them respect. We all have people that dislike us, so why spend time trying to look good for them? It's gym.. I hate gym, too. My teacher gives me so much anxiety with the fear he gives me. I also have that sudden feeling he's just going to attack and rape me....or some girl in my grade *shudders*.... Lol     I'm hoping you're not friends with any of these snobs, because if you're not, then good. Because then just don't give a sh** about these people. They aren't your friends and they probably won't be. You know that you know better than them because you don't judge people by how rich they are. Just think of it as 40 minutes to just waste and daydream.      Btw: Try just sweatpants and a short sleeve shirt? I do that; I don't want people seeing my legs, but I don't wanna get too sweaty (not that I do much in gym). Lol, Hope I helped somewhat with confidence :)|`|TyZ3OX0Oaa	I'm 33 years old, but I remember highschool like it was yesterday. I know that this may come as little consolation, but everyone in highschool is self conscious about something.|`|JdqDauEDaa	Maybe they're not as bad as you think? It's amazing how your perspective changes when you become a teacher. Just avoid them and remind yourself daily that you are strong.   Why don't you wear a t-shirt under your shirt and just take your top shirt off in the locker room and then put it back on after gym? You can wear shorts under your pants too. I wouldn't worry about your acne. When you are in middle school, you think everyone is paying attention to you, but in reality they are so absorbed in themselves that they aren't focused on your acne.     I use https://www.clearandsmoothskin.com/index... and it's the only thing that has worked. I wish I knew about it when I was a teen! I also found that when I eat milk products my acne gets worse. You may want to cut back.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	You have to take control of your self esteem.  Is there a bathroom or anthing that you can change?
AA12016833	My cousin took clomid (50mg) for one month and got pregnant with twins! I would say just go with the clomid. It never seems to fail..

kzt8Kdkfaa	All you can do is hang in there...she won't be this way for too much longer.  Give her all the attention she wants, this leads to a baby feeling secure, which leads to a baby who doesn't need constant reassurance from mom.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Try more food or let her cry it out sounds to me like she is use to your arms.  good luck!|`|rsCOEiDXaa	I agree with neato1975, you just need to hang in there just for a little bit longer. I know how tired and ansy you must feel. I had the same thing with my son at first, but believe me as soon as you try to change your attitude about it and think positively about it, you'll notice a difference. Think of how beautiful your baby is and how long you waited to see her, this will make you feel better.    We're all here to help you and support you, and don't let negative comments affect you. Take care of yourself and your precious baby!|`|xp0BnsD0aa	It will get better!    If my son woke quickly after a feed it was usually because he had a burp stuck in his tummy.  If the section of skin between the top lip and nose are pale, blue or greenish in colour in comparison to the rest of the baby's face there is some wind there.    Once a baby is overtired, they can seem to stay awake for ages.  Your baby is overtired if she stares, has jerky hand movements etc...    Try swaddling her tightly because her startle reflex may be waking her up.  This is when she throws her hands out suddenly when sleeping.    Best of luck.  Hang in there.  Just remember to ask a friend or family member to take over for a few hours when you need a rest.  Go and have a haircut or manicure, or even just a few hours sleep.      You can't 'spoil' a baby by cuddling her loads.  It is only after 3 months when she will make some sleep associations.|`|wphLaVs6aa	It's normal for babies to go through periods of time when they are difficult sleepers, or don't sleep on adults' schedules. This doesn't sound unusual to me. My son went through times when he would only sleep for an hour at a time, or would want to stay awake for a while. Your daughter is starting to see better than she did at birth. She'll start wanting to look around more and pay attention to her surroundings. And it's perfectly  normal for a baby to want to be held all the time and near you all the time.    Try getting a wrap or a baby carrier like an Ergo. Babies love to feel the closeness and also enjoy the movement when you're going about your business. They also sleep better when they're close.|`|NpomCCjUaa	I have a 4 week old son, who I'm breastfeeding. I have the same problem as you. He usually falls asleep on my lap after a feed, but as soon as I try to put him to bed, he wakes up. I try settling him in his bed, but I can't get him back to sleep. If I hold him, I can eventually get him to sleep in my arms, but as soon as I put him in his bed, again he wakes up. If I leave him asleep on my lap without trying to put him in his bed, he'll sleep for a couple of hours.     I've tried playing music, burping him, letting him cry for a little while, and patting him on the chest while he is in his bed. These sometimes work for a little while, but not every time. Taking him for a walk in his pram helps a little and he falls asleep in the car. They are my last resorts for when I can't take the crying anymore.    At night I have a bit more success, and I usually get him to do at least one 2 hour sleep in his bed, and sometimes I'll even manage to get him to sleep for another 2 hour sleep. Maybe it is better at night because I have the lights dim and it is quiet?     Basically I spend most of my days holding my baby. Occasionally he'll sleep for 10 minutes in his bed and I'll rush to put the laundry on, or grab a sandwich.     I guess my answer doesn't really give you an answer, but hopefully you'll see you aren't alone. I felt reassured to hear that other mothers have wakeful babies too.|`|Kg5KX432aa	4 weeks old and doesn't sleep??  That is very strange... do you drink too much caffeine maybe?

They're always going to be known as "that prego chick", they're going to need child support, and they're throwing away their education which they're going to need if they want to support a child. They're too young and stupid (again sorry to stereotype, I know not all of you are like that). =)|`|fKDZlxOsaa	because adolescents are the experts on sex. duh.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	i guess they think that other adolescents  are going to answer lightly or have gone  through the same thing.    or they're just trolls who want to get a bunch  of 12-17 year olds mad and see what happens.    i don't believe half of them, some of  them are either too detailed, impossible, not  frantic, or just seem made-up.    i agree, the question probably is suggested  for pregnancy but w/e.
7rCeCVl2aa	The kicker is she already has hired a publicist to get with the major $$$ talk shows like... Oprah... the last time octuplets were born in the USA (10 years ago) they were given all kinds of new free things including, a home, cars and furniture! It's hard to think she has loving intentions when she is sitting on a potential cash cow.    To answer your question I think there should be stricter guidelines. I'm sorry but implanting a single woman that lives with her parents and already has 6 kids should be illegal!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It's not so much that she already had six kids; it's that normally they only implant two eggs at a time, so I've heard. I recently watched a brief news clip from Yahoo, I believe, that came from Good MOrning America? anyway, the doctor interviewed said there can be LOTS of risks to the mom and the babies if too many eggs are implanted. I find it odd that so many were implanted yet they say she only wanted one more baby. Yeah, right. Perhaps she was doing it for attention, or wanted to see how many would take - I don't know. Whatever the case, though, she's damned lucky they all survived and are doing so well. That's a big chance to take with the innocent lives of children.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Many fertility specialists have already come out and sids this breaks any protocol they would have advised, including treating a woman with 6 children already for infertility.

You hit on all of our major points as well!  I think she's irresponsible, selfish, and probably in need of a mental health check up.  However, I think the doctors are just as much to blame here.  You're absolutely right, it should be regulated.  In-vitro is a last resort that gives a ray of hope to couples who are otherwise hopeless.  It's a gift of science that should be respected and regulated, not treated as a puppy mill.|`|vJEatJFPaa	Im kind of sick about all the hype about this woman. Its her life whatever.....

AA11138222	I LOVE the name Liliana, and I would pronounce it Lily-ah-na. I like the nicknames Lily and Ana (ah-na) and was thinking that if I ever have a girl I would use this name for just that reason :)    In your case I like Lilianna if you are gonna pronounce it Lily-AN-a and I like Lilianna Kate.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I would spell it Liliana.  I know someone w/this name and it's spelled like this.  Pronounced as in your first example.  Never heard it pronounced as in your second example.  So go w/first.  Of the two names I prefer Lilliana.  I would go w/Liliana Brynn.  That sounds so pretty.|`|rHufcHwHaa	1)  Lilianna     2) I prefer Lilianna to Annalee    3)  Lil-Ee-Ann-Uh    Very cute name!|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Lilyana Brynn (Lil-Ee-AWN-Uh)|`|4R93xF8naa	Annalee...wat a nice name  um i say Annalee Brynn!!! =]  Liliana [ i would spell it like that], is pretty too but i prefer ananlee  hope i helped =]|`|oTlqbdAlaa	Lilianna--Lil-Ee-Ann-Uh   Lilianna Kate|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Liliana Lil-Ee-Aw-Nuh|`|xhVe918waa	1)  Lilianna - Lilee-ah-nuh    2 ) Annalee.

Lil-e-aw-nah|`|hhkj5OvVaa	Obviously, personal preference... but for me:    Liliana.  Pronounced Lilly-ahna.  I also prefer Lily (pronounced lilly).     For me, Liliana is a classy way of combining two names, whereas Annalee is a little... obvious.     And, while I understand and appreciate Brynn... my name is Kate.  And I love it. :)|`|XgVVEKTWaa	Well it really depends. If you want to pronounce it Lil-Ee-Ann-Uh, then I would spell it "LilliaNNa", but if you wanted to pronounce it Lil-Ee-Aw-Nuh then you would spell it "Lilliana".    I personally like the name Lilliana better than Annalee. I also like the pronounciation Lil-Ee-Aw-Nuh better.     I reckon that both middle names would suit, but my favourite is Kate :)    Also, for Annalee, have you thought of Annaliese?     Anyways, good luck :)|`|2EcyWp2baa	1. Lilianna  2. Lilianna  3.

cnp21qZJaa	because america wants to hide its head and make sex a no- no subject!! education is what is required to help our youth from getting preg.! i had 1 class every other year for one day to teach us "about sex". and it was a waste of time!! we educate kids about other stuff! why cant we educate them about something that still kills!!    teens dont know and its the fault of anyone who does know for not telling! birth control pill works best (99% chance of doing its job) IF it is taken at exactly the same time everyday. you take it at 11am one day you need to take it at 11am the next and the next. im 25, have 2 kids, dont want any more for a while, and i take it. i can tell you from experience if you dont take it exactly how it says- its effectiveness falls drastically!   use condoms! they help not only against pregnancy but against STDs too! its out there- and most of it for free without your parents knowing!! please use it! i wish i had!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	they're absolutely nuts|`|hZuq2XT9aa	irresponsible and lack of judgement.    Most teen's are feeling the need to get pregnant only by those other's out there who are i guess...teen's are all in the same boat they don't think straight until it finally hit's them when they least expect it to.  Other than that,there only concern's is themselve's not there baby,most actually do pretty well with support.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i didnt get pregnant for attention  i switched to online school because i didnt want attention      but i agree with you that many teens are getting pregnant for attention  i had a friend that would tell me im lucky to be pregnant...and she would tell me atleast once a month that she is pregnant too. she is a dumbass and a liar    anyways, its because the school only teaches about abstinence and STD's. not about pregnancy|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Because they don't think!! they ARE nasty I agree 100%..plus you pregnant teens that got pregnant don't be offended by nasty, that's about the nicest thing we can say about you ayt? And we can't put all the blame on the girls the fathers were a part of it as well..let em share the nasty haha! People keep saying "they'll learn from our mistakes" when they don't learn ****..seems like its happening more nowadays..and its plainly OBVIOUS that it sucks to be pregnant when your a teen (even if its not you who is pregnant) yet they still do it! I guess they never really learn how bad it is till it happens to them...but by then its too late! When will they ever learn...SEX IS NOT A GAME! damn..|`|5f6XnInEaa	Well, I certainly did not do it on purpose.  I had sex, like a lot of other teens do, and unfortunately fell pregnant, despite birth control.    You must live in a pretty trashy area.    There aren't much pregnant teens here, and the ones that are pregnant may have gotten pregnant intentionally.  Who knows.    Why do you care?  It's none of your business.    Are you just jealous because they are getting attention?  Sounds like you are.  Grow up.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Some don't use protection, some have protection failure (this was my case, the pill failed), some could've been raped.  I also believe a lack of sexual education can be part of the reason for the teen pregnancy rate to be rising.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Well IMO I don't think that's the case. I mean, yes, there are cases of teen pregnancy. But the fact is you're at school, presumably with a lot of teenagers. Thus in your perspective there is a lot of teen pregnancies going on due to the population of people there at your school. However, I think if you thought large scale, it's probably not as bad as you think. And generally, I think people take more notice of pregnant teens than any other pregnant people too.|`|oNXygeVZaa	Some girls do it so they can get the attention.  And they think its play time.  Well it's not!!|`|5I0DXQKIaa	WOW talk about offencive IM 17 and IM pregnant i didn't try to get pregnant but honey some times things just happen so maybe you shouldn't go around calling  people nasty    so yeah you didn't mean nasty in that way yes allot of girls are having babies to young but would you rather they go and get an abortion rather then realize they made a mistake and take responsibility     IM really sorry you see this in the way that you do    god bless|`|tj6MgJujaa	Why would being pregnant make any woman look nasty????  You're just wrong for saying that.  But a lot of teens are getting pregnant because of what society makes of sex.  high school kids are "in love" and want to explore each other.  there's hormones everywhere and attraction and arousal.  It's normal to some people for teens to have sex but it's a different story when the girl gets pregnant.  Maybe they were too stupid and got caught in the moment and had unprotected sex thinking that they weren't going to get pregnant.  There are many reasons why people in our society behave the way they do. It's just they're life. you have yours too. If you got pregnant would you want other girls to call you nasty? No, right?  But pregnancy is a beautiful thing.  And teens are more likely to not use protection because they're soooooooo into being cool.  just deal with it!|`|VUss5AfAaa	hmmm i didnt get pregnant in highschool at all but im 20 and im almost due feb 14..turning 21 on sat..    im still conciderd young i guess..but i think its everyones decisions when and why to get pregnant..i dont judge much..and you shouldnt eather hun...  (babies are a gift from god) some teens just might think that a baby can bring them closer to the bf..when in reality its false.  there young and they will learn from there mistake.  while there not yours you should be happy.  and not worry about others.|`|ebCzRLw7aa	First off,   Im a pregnant teen and I never got pregnant because i thought it was cool.  How about you think before you point fingers.  Most teens dont think that they are going to get pregnant so they have unprotected sex.. not because they think its cool.  And nasty?  I beg your pardon!!  being a pregnant teen is NOT nasty!, pregnancy in any woman happens to be beautiful. it takes a strong woman, or teen to chose to give their body up to have a baby..  And its hard being a pregnant teen.. how about you walk a mile in our shoes and then ask your self this question!!|`|lFxlYx9zaa	Teens think its cool now but its not. In my opinion they are not thinking it through. They just want to fit in with the crowd, so they sleep around, party ,and do drugs. They don't think about the pregnancy's or the STD's they can get. We are not educating them enough or ourselves, so before we can judge them we need to look at ourselves. Are we letting them watch videos of half naked women griding on guys ? Men demeaning women calling them ho's and bitches, and saying that they are just sex objects. Really what are we thinking and what are they thinking ? We as a culture should know better !!!!!!!  Pay attention to what your children are doing. We have to stop this vicious circle !

AA11763588	Pregnancy symptoms and period symptoms are pretty much the same. You may have not even noticed them before but because you are TTC you are.    You very well could be, or you may not be. Just be patient and wait to see if you miss your period and take a test.    Good luck|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	sorry nobody on here knows if you are pregnant or not    you could be, you could not be.    go to your doctor to find out for sure.    you don't normally feel the early pregnancy signs unless you are about 4-6 weeks along.|`|oNXygeVZaa	wait couple more days, and if you don't get your period just take the test.|`|o9KJNCLJaa	just take a test to be sure, that's what i did.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	It is normal to have cramping in the early stages of pregnancy and maybe even a light flow or spotting the first time you should have had your cycle after becoming pregnant. With all my children I had a lot of cramping in the first couple months and with 2 out of 4 I had a light "period" of sorts the first month after conceiving some women even have real periods the entire time they are pregnant if you havent had your cycle in 3 or 4 more days then I would take a test if it comes up negative do it again if you still havent started in a few weeks. Good luck and I hope the results are what you wish them to be
nkZdtXXhaa	Oh yeah.  You can totally get it at CVS or Walgreens or whatever your local pharmacy happens to be.  Pretty cheap stuff too, but I wouldn't rely solely on it, which it sounds like you aren't doing so good job.    happy *******.  :D|`|Jswomud7aa	Any pharmacy will have spermicidal contraceptives.     My cousin uses a spermicide filled vaginal sponge and she loves it. She says you can insert it hours before you have sex and you don't even realize it's there.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	You can buy spermicidal lube practically anywhere you can get condoms. You can also try VCF's, you can get those in the same place. You can get those at Wal Mart but I reccomend Walgreens, they have a much better selection of stuff.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Wow. Ask the doc that gave you the BC.    Condoms and spermicide ARE birth control.    Of course you can get it in the USA, we have the most BC options now than ever, and yet 50% of births are illigitimate and there's 1 million abortions a year
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It sounds like you do have some early signs of pregnancy, the breast tenderness, tiredness, and dry skin, constipation all of those are pretty normal early pregnancy signs. With your periods being irregular Im not sure when would be best to test, if it were me I think I would try to wait about 2 more weeks and then start taking tests. Good luck.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Since your cycles are irregular it's hard to know when you should test. I would say to test now, and if it's negative wait a week and test again. If it's negative but you still suspect you are pregnant, see your doctor for a blood test.    Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|bcZSIphUaa	Have you been tested for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome?    It's a fairly common hormonal infertility disorder in women.    Symptoms include being overweight and having irregular periods.    It's easy to check whether you have it - blood tests!    Go to doctor please and get tested - if you have it you prob need fertility drugs to help conceive.|`|11FQyeakaa	There is always that chance that you could be pregnant. Wait another week or so and test.|`|a12cbnR4aa	If you know when you would have become pregnant you could count forward 2-3 weeks and take a test then. Or from when you started having symptoms. Otherwise you can go to a doctor and they can do a blood test.|`|p3d3E75oaa	well to be honest you could take a home test but you should really make an appointment with a doctor, I also know whats its like to be over weight and sometimes it could effect your period and conceiving I was very fortunate in that matter I weighed at almost 285 when I got pregnant this time and its with my 7 baby, you should have been going to the doctors from the very beging if you were trying to conceive because with all the weight their are all types of risks, but I hope everything works out for you and congrats on getting married.
sbedPdLDaa	it depends on if you live in a place w/ hard or soft water. I wouldn't feed the baby hard water even w/ the filter.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Around 4-5 months I stopped boiling water and stopped buying bottled water..and purchased a Brita Filter System and use that. As long as you know the tap water is healthy enough for human consumption ( no well water) and using that filter, you are good to go.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	Provided you live in an area with a safe water supply, it's just fine to use tapwater.|`|uSsmriwWaa	My son's pediatrician said it's not necessary to buy nursery water. She also said not to use bottled water because it is not have strict regulations on it's purity. She said the best thing to do is to use tap water that is purified. We fill our Brita with tap water an leave it on the counter. That way the water is purified and it's at room temperature and I don't have to warm his bottle. He's 8 1/2 months now and we've been doing it since he was born. Works great for us. The pur water filter is just as good. I would stick to that.|`|4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	My docot said to use tap water that had been boiled for 5 minutes!! No need to buy special water... its just a gimmick!|`|OgzHcNMsaa	I  just have a thermos and boil a kettle of hot water, pour it in the thermos and it stays hot for about 24 hours after. That's what I use to mix my formula. I wouldn't drink tap water myself (no matter where I live) so there's no way I'd use it to mix my baby's formula with her sensitive tummy.

Lr3lZ4draa	i was like that when i was first pregnant, but the bigger i got, the less often i felt like actually getting up and getting "dressed up" i wanted as  much relaxion i could get.    as soon as my son came though, you bet i dyed my hair as soon as i could, and went and bought all new make up.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    I dont look in the mirror that often if i do. I look at my belly and see how beautiful it is because of gift inside.  to make my self feel better/ beautiful.    I get new clothes when im able to., wear accesories bracelet , headband, ring, my earring.. Dress up when i go out. & make up. just to have different looks.  My partner is a blessings towards me that im really great ful. he will compliment me when i wear outing clothes or not. saying little things like that looks good. Or that shirt looks good. But he always kisses my bump. Which makes me feel better.   god Bless x but best thing that makes me happy is actually eating ice cream|`|fMnzjULCaa	I'm too busy being tired & working to even care about my looks. My poor hubby! I do feel so much better about myself when I actually get dressed, do my hair, put on makeup. I work from home so putting on makeup or doing my hair seems like a waste. I'm not going anywhere b/c it's too cold! I will tell you that I highlight my hair (kind of like you, chunky blonde w/ some brown throughout), go tanning & whiten my teeth (all at certain times during the year) & being pregnant I can't do any of that so really nothing makes me feel that hot. If I get down on my looks when I'm not pregnant I hit the tanning salon or nail salon (which seems like a waste of $ when you are saving for maternity leave!), beauty salon, etc. or get all dressed up for a night out on the town (which since it involves drinking, it's yet another thing I can't do). Now putting on makeup makes me feel a little better but not entirely.  But I'll just feel ugly b/c I wouldn't trade being pregnant for anything!|`|Bo4oGgf8aa	Well, I certainly don't have to pile on the make-up to feel beautiful. Ha ha.|`|IFqY2w1Paa	I think of myself in terms of being an important part of my family. Without me, who would clean the house, cook the meals, and take care of the bills? Being respected and nurturing my family makes me feel beautiful. =) My husband complimenting me, even though my body is changing, makes me feel beautiful. When my hair looks great or when my makeup looks perfect (not all days are like that!) makes me feel beautiful. Slipping on a dress makes me feel feminine and beautiful, too.|`|VFEjLgvuaa	I personally think pregnant women are the most beautiful thing in the world except for the babies and children themselves I have had 4 children and have been pregnant 7 times and was the most confident when I was pregnant and also if it makes you feel any better quite a few men have a fetish for pregnant women....more than you could ever imagine actually do so when he tells you your beautiful believe him and believe that you are beautiful because next to actual babies and children you are the most beautiful thing in the world|`|VUss5AfAaa	i pamper myself in the bathroom...what i get out of it...(you smell good babe). to be honestly with you if he sees you most of the time with makeup and fixed up there's not much to notice cuz he already knows how beautiful you are..even though we need to hear it right.    i was like that and once in a while i hardly put makeup on ..but when i do it out of the blue...he tells me i look pretty..so pretty much try to cool down witht the whole pretty thing cuz you know and he know it already...    and dont do it for going out..do it for him.  see i dont put makeup when we go to stores or anything like that..  but when we go out for dinner and he comes home from work im all pretty for him..i dont know this is my way of getting him to say it on his own.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	I also wear MAC makeup - I dress up everyday.    When I look good, I feel good too, and I appear more confident and happy - eventhough just that morning I threw up my favorite breakfast, have a killer headache, and have to pee every 2 hours!!!|`|tj6MgJujaa	BE CAREFUL NOT TO DYE YOUR HAIR AGAIN LATER ON IN YOUR PREGNANCY.  AND IF YOU FEEL SHITTY YOU'LL LOOK SHITTY.  BUT MOTHERHOOD IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.  AND THE KEYWORD IS SACRIFICE!  BUT EVERYONE IS PRETTY IN THEY'RE OWN WAY.  YOU DON'T NEED M.A.C. MAKEUP TO BE BEAUTIFUL.  AND YOU DON'T NEED YOUR MAN TO TELL YOU ANYTHING EITHER. JUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND BE CONFIDENT.  DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHERS SAY.  YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE. EMBRACE IT!|`|MLPzeOtOaa	First off, you really should not be bleaching your hair during pregnancy.     What you are really saying is you only feel beautiful when you are wearing an expensive mask of makeup?        You are growing a child! how much more beautiful can you get??|`|eFB2jLVbaa	i don't always have to look beautiful i feel that even when i'm wearing a pair or aero sweat pants with my hair up and NO make up i'm still beautiful, being pregnant is one of the most beautiful things and if i'm not comfortable i don't feel right, i just like to have my baby bump showing and i gleam ^-^|`|Q6Ihs4otaa	well im pregnant with my first *teen-mommy*  well i take a bubble bath... with my bf or with out.   relaxing.. i buy new pregnancy clothes. be exotic towards my bf like before i was pregnant.   good luck :)|`|Zi6Fr49Laa	Instead of wearing frumpy maternity clothes I wore regular clothes in a bigger size. Thankfully today's styles are compatible with a baby belly. I also had regular manicures and pedicures (great for sore feet anyway) and took advantage of the fact that my hair didn't shed during pregnancy and let it get really long and thick. I just stayed on top of my trim appointments. While being pregnant any beauty treatment is a break and a relief.|`|kZFov1x6aa	I only wear make up on special occasions, being 31 weeks i really dont have the energy for that crap at the moment. My husband tells me everyday how beautiful i am and how i have that 'glow'... you shouldnt have to dye your hair and wear make up everyday to feel beautiful.. thats all superficial stuff.|`|SgOVFseaaa	Your problem has nothing to do with makeup or hair dye.  It is psychological.  Thus, it cannot be solved with a day at the spa or a trip to M.A.C.      Time to do some serious soul searching.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Some mild period like cramping is normal in early pregnancy. I didnt even know I was pregnant because I just thought my period was coming. It is normal as long as it isnt severe and there isnt bleeding.|`|AA12123428	Go to A&E  Good luck|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	no its normal, as long as it isnt a sharp pain... but congrats on ur bundle of joy...|`|tj6MgJujaa	I THINK THAT YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY.  BUT IT IS A GOOD THING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR.  BUT I THINK THE PAIN IS BEING BROUGHT ON BY YOUR BODY CHANGING.   I HOPE ALL GOES WELL.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	It's absolutely normal.    The reason you're cramping is because the follicle that released the egg is releasing progesterone to sustain the embryo while it's attached to the uterine wall.    The follicle is releasing liquid as well, and it can swell your fallopian tubes causing pain, similar to cramps.    Think positive, and wait to see your doctor.  As long as you're not bleeding, you shouldn't worry.  : )|`|cnp21qZJaa	as long as its not a sharp shooting pain you should be good. some cramping is usually normal. some people even spot or have normal "periods" the fist months. and wind up have a fine and healthy pregnancy|`|1xZ3lqSGaa	Sorry for the lost. You need to try too relax and not worry so much, but cramps are not good sign that how I lost my baby also. Go to the doctir A.S.A.P.|`|6XsyfBBKaa	YAY Stranger!!!  I am hoping and praying this is the one for you.      The bummer of the thing is symptoms of both the good thing and the bad thing are the same.  When my friend got preggo last time she had cramps so bad that she thought for sure it was a MC... and of course everything was perfectly normal and she has a wonderful baby boy now.  Most recent MC I had, I had no symptoms, no cramping, just went to the bathroom and there was all of a sudden blood.  So, moral of the story is try not to worry...  just say your prayers and see your doctor often.      For me, having the doc tell me my HCG levels helped... getting it done every other week or so, seeing that it was going up the way it should (but it was also how I knew I was MC... so it wasn't a surprise either).  So just tell your doc you'd feel better getting your HCG checked often so you'll know either way.    Good luck, and I'm praying for you!
XzV4bUeFaa	you have to get a lawyer who handles adoptions.  you have to both have a physical exam as well as your daughter.  then you have to get her father to give up all rights and claims to her.  If he's willing to do this, then most likely the adoption will be granted.  Her birth certificate will even be changed to show that your fiance is her father.  But if her biological father doesn't sign away parental rights, it probably can't happen.|`|b0c40e7b40bcb96c377c4b40de94c0c0aa	well..its a tough ask.your fiance can give her the love she needs.But it would take her some time to come out of that illusion.Just ask him to be close enough to her.So that she will slowly try to forget about the first one.well.. please support the little one.as she is going through a tough time.its not that easy for a 2 year old to forget her father.lots of love is the only thing which works here..you have to get a lawyer who handles adoptions.best of luck...|`|cddc8069d50a9c0970cf9101369f17fdaa	After you get married see a lawyer to draw up the legal paper work .It should be read in court and a judge will finalize the adoption after everyone has signed off on it.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Have you thought about talking with her biological father about allowing your fiance to adopt her? It is much easier to do a consensual adoption rather then a battle...     My husband adopted my oldest daughter... It was very nice, her biological father didn't see her, pay child support, and was all to happy to sign his rights over to my husband after finding out that he would no longer be held responsible for child support, he will have to pay back child support owed but other then that he is free and my daughter has her daddy who loves her unconditionally and is there for her through every moment!
5wmrZEQ9aa	I have a 9 month old, and she got her first cold when she was 4 months old and has had several since then (she's in daycare, so she gets sick a lot).  First of all, don't give the Tylenol or Motrin unless she gets a fever.  Run a warm, not steaming, shower, and get in with her, and sit in the shower, in the steam for a while.  After you get out, get the nasal aspirator (nose bulb), and suction out the gunk from her nose.  That will help more than anything to make her more comfortable.    You can also get nasal drops, saline, for her nose.    Get the Vicks baby rub for her chest.  Put a vaporizer in her room, or one of the Vicks plug-ins.    Feed her often, to get liquids in her.   That is pretty much all you can do.  The doctor won't be able to give her any meds at her age.    I know it is hard when you have a sick baby, and you feel helpless, but just give her lots of comfort and cuddle time.|`|GNtsdk4saa	Slow down with the Tylenol and Motrin, mom.  They only help with the fever (and pain, which she doesn't have), and if she doesn't have a fever, you shouldn't give them to her.  Tylenol and Motrin can stress her tiny kidneys and liver if you give her too much.  Stick to the recommended dosage.    I know it's scary when it's your first baby getting sick, but try to remember that it's only a cold.  She's cranky because she has a cold and doesn't feel quite herself.  Keep the humidifier running in her room, and if she gets a "barking" cough (which is croup) take her into the bathroom and run a steamy shower to help her breathing.  She'll be fine, and so will you!  Hang on 'til morning.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	yeah tylenol and motrin are only for pain, I have a baby who will turn 5 months on weds and he got congested and his was raspy as well all we did was not bathe him and we would do the vapor as well in the bathroom and we were cleaning his noise with the bulb syringe, I know it's hard  to hear her so congested but the med. won't help do vapor as well, oh and good luck with doctor now a days they don't give you anything especially b/c they are so little my baby was like that for about a week now he is better|`|1xZ3lqSGaa	Get the baby rub vicks put on her chest and back . use vaporizer that have the refills let that be on at night . Try to blow out her nose to help her breath that what I did for my baby and it help. She is 39 weeks|`|aZyfEugvaa	Did you take her to the doctor? I wouldn't give her all of that stuff...if she has a cold she will be fine without all that junk...why are you giving it to her in the first place? Tylenol and Motrin are not going to help runny noses..if she is congested and stuffy sit in the bathroom with her while you run a hot shower so she can breath in the steam...slow down with all the meds...is she teething?|`|ZN5CyENLaa	You are only supposed to give your baby Tylenol or Motrin every 4 to 6 hours.  I prefer Tylenol! I took my daughter to the Dr like a month ago & my Dr told me that babies are like immune to getting seriously sick up to 6 months old because of something that they get while they are still in your belly. Im not sure if I believe that or not though. My daughter is 1 and I took her back to the Dr today because she is sick and come to find out she has thrush (thick white stuff on her tongue) from the antibiotics she took last time she was sick. She's been feeling like she has a fever but every time I check, she doesn't. She got a diaper rash and her cheeks were kinda red and shes congested and raspy sounding and cranky. All the symptoms go together so she could have thrush. Id take her to the Dr to check. They will give her antibiotics to clear it up if that's what it is. Plus, a humidifier helps & don't keep your house to warm because it makes it hard to breathe.
JnLoHaoAaa	I towel dry and then it seems to air dry the rest pretty quickly|`|Jswomud7aa	Towel dry, comb, then air dry :)     Usually the towel is enough to absorb most of the water, afterward it's pretty damp, but it evaporates fairly quickly. I give my kids baths about 2 hours before bed, so their hair is completely dry by that time.|`|M6c0hUefaa	My daughter is 10 months and has a TON of hair. After her bath we just towel dry it, get her dressed, then towel dry it some more.

And I mean a ton.  I had so much fun doing her hair when she was little.  Usually I would just towel dry most of it, they i would run my hands through it and blow gently for a while sometimes.  It would help her fall asleep as well.  I was always too afraid to use the blow dryer, because of the noise.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My baby is nearly bald, so a towel dries it completely. His brothers have thick hair so it takes some time to dry it as much as I can with a towel, even then it's still a bit damp. I just let it air dry because my kids can't stand the noise a hair dryer makes for more then a couple of minutes. Mine has a cool air setting so I wouldn't have to worry about it being too hot for them.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	My daughter has lots of hair, but i hate the hair dryer for some reason lol and I dont even use it on myself! I just put the towel on her head and rub it all around.

dPyfP0ijaa	Thats tough, one because at that age they're lazy and defiant anyway, but also because you're his sister, also look into some type of counseling. The fact that his father has cancer is probably alot to do with why he's acting out. He needs counseling for that.      The best thing to do is the same with any other age child, consequences, little ones get "time-out" The older ones get grounded or priveleges taken away. He needs to be told that you are the boss of him, have his mother explain that to him. Give him clear lists of chores and a time they need to be completed by or else he gets his games taken away or he's not allowed to go anywhere or have friends over.    I had custody of my little brothers after my parents split, so I know exactly what you're going through.     Some more consequences could be taking his bedroom door off (but save that one more for when you catch him smoking weed)    Also don't forget to reward the good behavior, like allowances or shopping expenses or buy him something he really wants, but hold onto it until he gets his asss in gear for a week or two straight.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	GUILT him into helping......or just be honest with him.  "Dude, I come over here all the time to help out because Dad is ill and that's what family does for one another.  Do you think you could get off your Lazy butt for 10 minutes and think about helping out too?  With all the parents have to deal with you think you should be waiting to be told how to pitch in?  Who's going to be the Man of the house if something happens to Dad, surely not you?"|`|EKL9JCL9aa	Your mom needs to find her backbone and tell the lazy kid to shape up.   My kids are 15 and 17 and they are not even allowed to turn the tv on until their chores are done. They are required to come straight home from school to get things done. Once they finish their chores and homework they are free to do as they please until curfew. If the chores arent done correctly, they are grounded - no phone, ipod, computer, friends.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	he's a bum
oP504BtFaa	I have two options for you:    Keep the walls and furniture neutral and dress up the room with bedding and accessories, or paint the walls in a color but don't give the room a theme. Paint isn't too expensive, so even if she outgrows the color, it's easily changeable. However, if you have developed a theme surrounding the color, it will be harder to change...see what I mean? If her favorite color right now is purple, paint her new room purple! If in two years she likes green, paint it green. Paint is pretty inexpensive.    I wouldn't suggest painting her room gray or tan or anything 'neutral' such as those...if anything go white, but a tan room to me is no fun for a little girl!|`|5DB6nOXkaa	Do something a bit sophisticated, that way it can last through her teen years. Get furniture that can go with different things ex. plain black/white/dark brown. So even if her favorite color is pink today and next year it's green you only have to change bedding/paint color or accent colors.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	She'll change alot over the next 8 years, so I would go very neutral in the permanent parts of her room. Go neutral (tan, beige, grey...) on the wals and floor and furniture. Use bedding, pillows, picture frames, accessories to bring in her favorite colors right now. If she decides she hates those colors in a few years, it will be easy to change them.|`|XX0RUwQYaa	Im not a mom but I do think that maybe a a ballerina room would be very cute!!! Maybe on one wall get a long mirror with no frame around it! Maybe she would like that. I think that if you got something a little big older for her age you wont have to keep changing her room! Or maybe even try some of these links! They might help give you a better idea of what you and her both want in her room! Good luck I Hope I helped! =]    http://images.meredith.com/bhg/images/20...    http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3135/2598...    http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2361/2243...    http://www.thatsmyroom.com/publicimage/g...    http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/pictures-...    http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/pictures-...|`|2F5HNPqPaa	Do something neutral that will grow with her.  Lilac is a good girly colour, but not as "little girly" as Barbie pink for example!  You can keep the wall colours neutral and have lots of girly cushions, posters, bedding etc that she can change and choose herself as she gets older.|`|qRElKKjXaa	If you are buying her new furniture I would invest in some pieces she'll like from now through high school. Don't get anything with a theme, just simple, classic pieces. A double bed (if it won't be too big for the room), a chest of drawers, desk and nightstand and maybe bookshelves would be great. I got new furniture (including an awesome antique headboard) when I was 11 and I still love, love looooove it and I'm 17.     I've painted my room every couple of years from ten to fourteen and then stuck with the light green that I have now. I would paint my room my dad, and it was actually really, really fun. I don't think paint is all that expensive. Right now at Home Depot it's only like $18.00 a gallon after using a mail-in rebate. You probably only need one gallon. Paint her room in her favorite color, and know that it probably won't be her favorite anymore in a couple of years. If you don't want to paint every few years, then stick with a more neutral color and use throw pillows as accents.    Get a comforter or duvet that is reversible.     Talk with her about all this. My mom gave me a bunch of decor magazines and we looked a lot of sites and wrote down ideas and drew out how I wanted the room to be. It was fun for us. We like crafts and we did a bunch of them for my room. There are easy, inexpensive ways you can decorate. Like one thing we did was get this really long dowel rod and paint it pink and then hung colored yarn from it. I would take all postcards and concert ticket stubs and punch a hole in the top and then hang it on a string.     Have fun!!!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My daughter is 8 years old and has light pink walls, white furniture and cheetah carpeting....we are planning on putting a jungle mural on the walls one of these days, so it's a good combination of girlie and growing up.|`|c33d94bc4bf7ce92a4a982d6c092b04caa	I'd just go with a basic color on the walls so that she can re-decorate as she changes and grows.|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	She's 10, why not just ask her what she wants?    If she's indecisive I say just stick to basic colors?  Maybe instead of pink you can do purples.  The black and white medallion with a real girly bright color is in style right now, maybe she would like that.  Really though, if it were me I wouldn't go with a theme.  I would stick to 3-4 colors and leave the walls white.  If she's still girly then pinks and purples with shades of magenta might work, how about more earth and neutral tones - beige, green, browns even yellows. They have very pretty brown and pink prints these days.  Find out what her favorite color is and just use all different shades of that color.  As she gets older she can upgrade with different decor, mirros, paintings, pictures, etc.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	At 10 she is really on the cusp of the teenage years..if I were you I would encourage her to pick a nuteral wall and carpet colour and let her be creative with acssories...rugs, bed clothes, cushions and curtains etc...these things are much cheaper to replace in 3 or 4 years time when she wants to appear more grown up, and its a lot easier to get a new rug than re-decorate.  A plae "grown up " pink or natural colour palate is the way I would go .  good luck with your move :).|`|nRObJuJeaa	ask her what she likes and go shopping for paint/decorations/etc together. she'll be spending the most time in there so its important that she like it.
kQC4HX6vaa	I thought wars, martyrs, suicides, and natural disasters would take care of the over-population problem...    ...LOL, apparently those deaths aren't enough for some people.    I'd say to that "expert" in response to her sign "Save the planet, kill yourself":      "YOU FIRST!"|`|puCOYwMmaa	I think it's pretty awful, and to top it off limiting families to 2 children wouldn't really fix the global warming problem.  The problem isn't how many kids we're having it's how we're choosing to live on the planet.    Luckily though something like this would never become official policy.    p.s. China's 1 child law doesn't force people to have abortions.  There's a fine if you have more kids, it's insanely high, way more than most people can afford but they let you keep the kid.|`|JsshzKM9aa	Wow.

Also, you should watch ENDGAME by Alex Jones if you're into the govt. conspiracies and stuff. It's EXTREMELY interesting, and talks about how govts. around the world (including the US) want to pass laws only allowing you to have a certain amount of children - 2 I think - and then make you get "fixed".  And also about the military secretly giving pregnant women vitamins that make them infertile for more pregnancies.  You can search for the full video on Google. It's EXTREMELY interesting.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Sounds like China.      It was coming, do I agree with it? No, I think the British moron should go back to school and re-evaluate why he does what he does.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	Obviously a ridiculous idea--even people who favor abortion heavily wouldn't support forced abortion.

I love how people are saying that it's people having babies that is causing the fictional global warming but no one says that maybe we should ban smoking because of all of the toxic fumes or that there shouldn't be any alcohol made anymore because of the excessive amount of grain or fruit that it takes to make it...nope it must be the cars and babies!!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Expert my azz he sounds so ignorant.

VR9KhbEgaa	I have said for a while that I think my 9 year old son is going to a hostage negotiator for a SWAT team or a hell of a defense attorney. He is beyond persistent and will try to negotiate with anyone about anything! He does not stop until the other person gives in! He has been this way since he entered the world! Trust me I was almost embarrassed on Halloween night when he was negotiating what piece of candy he wanted at certain house and even tried trading some candy he got at one house to the next house because he liked what they had better!!!|`|PbZefItUaa	Samantha says she wants to work as a scientist.. but she'll probably have something to do with helping others or communications..  Caleb says he is going to be a neurologist.. and I can see him as that.  Jacob wants to be a mechanic but he will probably end up doing something in the art field.   Courtney is going to be a paleontologist (I don't even know if I spelled that right!) and I can see her as one.. though I would love for her to be a lawyer... she is so good at winning in arguments!  Mikayla wants to be a dentist.. which I can see, but I think she will end up in accounting.  Ashlie will end up doing something where she can talk to others and be social... maybe working with kids, like a social worker or child care provider..  Logan wants to be a baseball player but I think he will be a music teacher... it just seems to fit him.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	Gracie's only a year, but she LOVES to examine and manipulate things- if she can get her hands on something mechanical (like a remote control, a small clock, really anything new), she just stares at it and turns it on every angle and is totally enthralled with the item.  She learns really quickly what things are, too.  So, maybe a researcher?  Something that pays attention to details.  She also likes our pets- I'd love for her to be a vet!!|`|jcdey9cgaa	My oldest loves animals and is very caring and compassionate and loves to help those who can't help themselves.

Police officer, manager, judge something like that.    My youngest (one of the twins) loves to take stuff apart and put it back together.  I see him and some sort of engineer.

If someone even mentions blood vessels or tissue, she says her neck starts throbbing and her legs turn to rubber!  Haha!  Weirrrdd!    But I have no idea what she will be.  She's super smart (3rd in her sophomore class); her lowest grade last semester was a 97, and she takes all pre-ap classes.  But she doesn't perfer or stand out in any particular subject over the others.  And right now, the only thing that seems to interest her (besides studying) is cheerleading and her boyfriend.  She can't think of any career she'd like to pursue.  Maybe she'll be a professional student?  Or just a really smart mom - like me! haha!  (But hopefully not too soon!)|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I always joke that my son should be a detective.  He doesn't miss a thing.  He is very curious and asks a million questions, and is also very observant.  You cannot hide anything from him (he's 3).  If I try to sneak a cookie while he's in the washroom, he comes running out "what's that you're eating mommy?", and when I think he's not listening or paying attention, he has heard every word.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I think my daughter will be in the art field.

Today he is in engineering school. My daughter always loved people and seemed to have a real talent for empathy and caring.  She is majoring in science and considering medical school.  That's sort of in character, but when she was young, we guessed she would become a writer or an actress, since she spent most of her time making up and acting out stories.      I do think kids show some definite personality traits and inclinations very young.  But there are so many ways those can fit into different types of jobs that it's easy to look back and say "I knew he would pick that!"|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Well our son will be 12 months in two days. His personality is playful, extremely active, and somewhat aggressive like he always wants his way. I think he would be in business (maybe marketing) or a star athlete (football).

I know you must be scared.      The chance that you might be pregnant is slim - it doesn't sound like the condom broke, BUT NOTHING IS CERTAIN.  Either way, now is NOT the time to panic.  You have such a sweet heart - not wanting to kill your baby.  People your age that think like that are hard to find.  God smiles on you, sweet girl!      Let me say this... do not take those pills if you do not want to.  THIS IS A DECISION THAT IS SOLEY UP TO YOU - even if it is his kid, it DOES NOT MATTER - IT IS YOUR BODY.  And yes, it is YOUR FAULT if you get pregnant - but just as much as it is HIS fault too.  And it is also rare to find a girl your age willing to admit that.  So THANK YOU FOR ACTING LIKE A GROWN UP!  That is refreshing to hear!    Put your mind at ease for now.  Wait for your period.  If it does not come, take a test.  You can purchase the tests at 99 cent stores or stores like Dollar Tree! CHEAP AND EFFECTIVE!  And if your test is positive, talk with your family, church pastor, or school counselor.      YOU WILL BE OKAY... I am 36 and was a teenage mother.  It was so rough... but we made it through!      YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!      Good luck to you, sweet girl!

If I were you I would take the morning after pill, because your egg hasn't been fertilised yet, and I completely understand that you don't want to kill your baby, because i would never be able to have an abortion. If you take the pill now then you can just forget this happened.The morning-after pill stops you from becoming pregnant if contraception failed or wasn't used.    Although lots of people talk about the 'morning-after pill', this term is actually misleading. In reality, the pill works for up to 72 hours (three days) after sex.    But the earlier you take it, the better: the 'morning-after pill' works best if taken within 12 hours of unprotected sex.It's believed Levonelle works by:    preventing your ovaries from releasing an egg    altering the lining of the womb, so a fertilised egg can't embed itself there.     In Britain and many western countries it is regarded as an emergency contraceptive, not an abortion-causing drug - it won't work if you are already pregnant.  The 'morning-after pill' is now widely used by women who have had unprotected sex. In particular, it has proved of value to:    rape victims, who should insist they are given it (unfortunately, UK doctors who examine women have sometimes been slow to prescribe it)    couples who have a condom break during sex    women who have been lured into having sex while under the influence of drink or drugs.    Good Luck Hun xx|`|ZAN6feeMaa	I'm an elementary school teacher, and I'm disgusted by such irresponsible adolescent behaviour. Your mind is too young to digest the responsiblility and accountability.

Could you see it was there?  Was the condom too big/small for him - They come in various sizes.    There will be no baby to kill yet if the sperms have just gone in.  It can take up to SIX days for a sperm to find and fertilise an egg. Depending on your body and where the egg is in your cycle.  TAKE THE PILL.    Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone called the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG). HCG doesn't start being released until the fertilised egg implants itself and pregnancy begins.|`|zu7lHvCdaa	Its gonna be okay take a deep breath! And Kudos for using protection! First off by taking the morning after pill (also plan b) all you are doing is preventing the sperm from reaching the egg and fertilizing. If you are already pregnant theres nothing the pill can do and wont harm the baby.  Second do you know if you were ovulating? thats usually about 2 wks after ur period, everyones different though, usually u see a discharge thats clear like egg whites.   There is always a chance u could be pregnant but i think in this case there might be a slim chance considering the condom wasn't completely off, or was it? was there still sperm in the tip of the condom? Regardless, sorry hun but u'll have to wait at least 3 weeks after u had sex to find out if u r preggo I didnt find out till I was 5 wks but every woman is different i know the answer is long but hope it helps.

You are not to be judged by regret you are worth so much more than negative feelings about yourself.     Go to the doctor.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	If you take the morning after pill it's not killing your baby, it keeping you from having one.  It's like birth control pills or an I.U.D.      TAKE THE PILL before it's too late.  Do you want to ruin you life?    It takes away for the sperm to get to the egg, so you are not pregnant.  It just keeps you from getting your eggs fertilized.    TAKE THE PILL    The only time to find out if you are pregnant is if you have missed your period, some test do test possitive 4 days before your next period.  You need to keep track of all your periods.  On the start day of each month write in your calander "start".  This way you will have an idea of when you will be starting the next month.  After you do this for 2-3 months count the days in between to see how long your cycles are.  My last period was Jan 10th.  My cycles are usually 28 days, so my next start date will on or around Feb7th. Always make Day  1 the day you start your period.  It's a GREAT idea to keep track of them so you will not freak out if you think you are late.  When you start going to an OBGYN, the first thing they ask you is "what;s the first day of your last period", Now you will know, if you do this.|`|LGkb4xibaa	i think if you used a condom then it should be ok. At the same time you should really take the morning after pill. This isnt an abortion. It prevents the sperm fertilizing your egg.     Also, i appreciate your boyfriend is saying he'll stick by you if you were pregnant. But pressurizing you into sex when you were not ready was selfish and inconsiderate. Particularly on your first time. You need to really look at how much this guy respects you. If he loves you he should have waited.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	thats one doodle that can't be undid home skillet|`|256cVXsmaa	Oh no hun you need to take themmmmm!!!! It wouldn't be a baby yet because you haven't went through conception yet.  If you just had sex tonight you need to take them tonight that way you are safe.  You need to understand that you are stopping the sperm from getting to the egg in the first place when you are taking the morning after pill that is why you have to take them so early.  When you get an abortion it is totally different because you are terminating an already fertilized egg.  Your egg hasn't been fertilized just yet.  If you take the pill tonight you will stop that little sperm from getting to your precious egg haha =]  Take it... and then get on birth control so you can be as safe as possible while having sex.|`|qbzt3r4xaa	14 n proud answerz..amazin|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Taking the morning after pill does not "kill your little baby" it simply stops the fertilised egg from implanting. Please don't be foolish, take one of the pills today...I'm sure you're worried over nothing though if you used a condom...I'm think every girl worries she's pregnant the day after she looses her virginity. You can test on the first day of your missed period. x|`|Dhsyroekaa	if you used a condom your most likely fine.

The morning after pill doesn't kill a baby.  The egg and sperm take a while to meet, and the morning after pill just prevents the two from ever meeting.  It's NOT an abortion.  It's like a supersized dose of birth control, that's all.  It's just a preventative measure.  You should take it right away to make sure it is the most effective, besides, it will ease your mind.  You're only 14, take the pill and get on a regular birth control regimen if you're going to continue to have sex.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	You would not find out if you are pregnant or not until like maybe 5-7 before your period is due by using a home preganancy test.     A blood test will show if you are or not 7 days after conception.    I would go ahead and take the pills if it were me because it will cost more if you were to get an abortion later on.    A 14 year old cannot take care of a baby because they are still relying on their mommies and daddies to take care of them so how could they be a perfect little family?|`|L6zgCGUZaa	If you used a condom, then your most likely not going to be pregnant. But just incase you are id get tested if you dont start your period when your due, give it a few days after and then get tested. But, I advise you to take the morning after pill anyway because your most likely not pregnant anyway, and my friend lost her virginity and regretted it the day after, so we took her to Brook and she took the morning after pill there, in the comfort of a Sexual Adviser, she was 14, and it will ruin your childhood if you ARE pregnant and you want to bring a child up.|`|mFjXMy0Waa	er`I think the condom and the pill(if you take,and now it is way to early for the sperms and your egg to became a baby) will make the pregnant chance very very small. But after all ,the most important thing is to know actually what you want and what you do not,so think twice before you make another decision like this.|`|BAyW22qjaa	I don't know but could you find a mature boyfriend and not a low life freak. ill, lil kids are so nasty these days in time.

VwHVDTv4aa	Everyone develops strange fears and discomforts throughout life. Is it hurting him not peeing in a urinal? My guess is that it's not. I doubt he would even get harassed by other boys, because they can probably just assume that he is doing his regular business just like everyone else in the bathroom is.    I have dated many guys that wouldn't even use a public restroom, and not just because of a fear of germs. But mostly because of the 'public' aspect. If he doesn't want to grow out of this phase himself, then you shouldn't force the issue. It's his body and he needs to learn for himself how to cope in the world with it.|`|LqimEAfWaa	I wouldn't consider it a big deal.  He's using the restroom how he wants to.  Would you rather he not using the bathroom at school at all???    My husband went to college with a guy who refuses to use public restrooms at all.  In fact, he left school in the middle of the day to go home and use the bathroom.  And he lived about an hour from the school!  Needless to say he got into trouble for it and wasn't allowed to graduate.  Now he needs to retake the class because of it.    Let your son use the stall.  It's ok.  As I said, would you rather have him call you to take him home and use the restroom in the middle of the day?|`|m2aznd8xaa	he could be a late bloomer and is feelin insecure all kids go through this when they start reaching the teen years and puberty starts to hit. once he goes through puberty and its all over hell be okay. it no big deal. he doesnt feel comfortable and he feels to exposed is all.he will eventually grow out of it.|`|ANZWru1Laa	It is a personal choice and does not mean anything negative. I know some men that do not like using urinals, so what? He is well old enough to use the restroom however he is most comfortable. Some people are embarrassed easily and need more privacy, it's not a bad thing. Be supportive of him now, his body is changing and he feels uncomfortable with the changes, we all felt that way when puberty first started.|`|UD1ki1I1aa	wow wtf?  everyone in middle school should use a urinal.  well, the guys.  most guys DON'T pee sitting down...|`|661f39420372e21b090f02f05da73dfaaa	Kids develop strange quirks, just relax and don't make a big deal out of it. As long as he is not peeing his pants all is good.|`|MzmDqZ26aa	Show him that he's wrong. Use every other boy in his grade (school, really) as an example. Plus, it's not like he's dropping his pants to use the urinal--privacy is still maintained.    I've heard that kids become self-conscious at puberty, but this is something else.|`|2w7mUeLdaa	I don't like to pee in urinals and I'm 19. I have a shy bladder. It's normal, just let him pee how he wants.|`|2zU7MS4raa	Well, I don't like to pee in an urinal, and I AM 15! So I guess it is common in adolescence, but in some kids.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	My son says he doesn't like them either. He likes to go in the stall and stand up, but not because he is embarassed. He just doesn't like the splashback. I don't think it's all that uncommon. They are kinda unsanitary and it's hard to pee when other people are in the room.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	Does he mean he's sitting down and peeing?  Or is he just standing up int he stall as well?  It's not a big deal to be standing up and using the toilet in the stall, maybe he just doesn't like urinals.  It's not that big a deal, he seems shy about going to the bathroom and going in the stall ensures that he can go in peace, let him be.
X9JSlC6Iaa	That's was pretty rude of her to say that because people don't have to have good grades to get something nice. Maybe people do if they had horrible grades and went from a d average to a b average, then yeah maybe they get something nice. But for you, you said you get good grades for yourself, keep it like that. I got a car for my 16 birthday. That was for good grades. And I was in the same situation as what I said.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	yeah dont worry about it shes spoiled, i agree with the phone thing who neeeds a fancy phone as long as it works.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Just think when you are older and graduate college with an awesome degree, you will be making more money than those girls on the bus! Don't worry about what you are going to get for having good grades, just know that you are doing this so you can have a better future and you can do something you love.  I hope you stay making good grades!
iFYDJyIZaa	I got suspended once for thinking I was Napoleon Dynamite. I tied a ceramic horse to a piece of yarn and drug it behind the bus like Napoleon did with the action figure.     I also ate 2 crayons for a dollar.    There was also this not so nice smelling boy in one of my classes. We had to take group photos, and we took them on the bleachers. Anyway, he sat one level down from me, and his butt crack was sticking out... so I threw mints down his pants.          I know, I'm cruel.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	When I was a sophomore, the senior prank. They let small barn yard animals loose in the school. It was funny.

You are basically saying "What is you are best highschool story?"      e: sorry, i'm a grammar freak.|`|PAjHWRhsaa	Ah...high school. I miss it....I have lots of memories, most being senior pranks. I was in on the senior prank for my sophomore, junior, and senior years. The best one, the senior prank when I was a senior. My friend worked in the front office last block so he turned off the cameras, she was a junior. Seniors were already out so we all had shaving cream and put shaving cream on every single car in the parking lot, 200+ cars. Then when school let out we all had huge water guns and filled them will all sorts of things, colored water, beer, anything we could find, and we soaked just about every single person who drove. There was also the time when the anthrax scares were going around....we were all in the gym on a Friday for a pep rally and usually after pep rally we had lunch right after, but that day they made us go straight to third block classes and they announced we would go home and said there was an anthrax scare. Turns out, the lunch ladies saw cheese in the bottom of a pizza box and thought it was anthrax!! One more.....it is a memory....for our project graduation thing, where after graduation all the seniors go to a place and are pretty much shut in until 6 the next morning.....we ordered this illegal liquor from over seas. Some lime green stuff. And we pretty much all got drunk in front of parents and everyone. No one had a clue why! The liquor was never found by any parents or anyone. I miss high school!!! I'd go back if I ever could!|`|bLbuQS2vaa	I don't really have ONE awesome story about highschool. Pretty much my entire freshman year. while all the freshman sat and learned and were scared to skip i skipped pretty much every day and had the time of my life with the coolest people. we would go swimming in my friends apartment's pool drink our livers to death smoke our lungs out. and it was the best time ever!! it was a year full of protests, love, failing classes, and a lot of illegal doings. but it was worth it because i found my true friends and will never forget that year.... ahhhhhhh memories... =]|`|Jucak0HLaa	Well.Today was pretty funny.They gave out the little babies today where you have to bring them around and take care of them.Well,we were in class and a girl's started to cry...My teacher yelled out "Santana,I can't take that.Pull out your titty or something."
yCwPxulYaa	My baby starting chuckling around 3.5 months old.    She giggled though, this past weekend at almost 5 months old.  Now she is gigging a lot.  It is the sweetest thing that you will ever here.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl has been giggling for two weeks, so at around 3.5 months, but no laughs yet.  Her giggles are still far and few between, but I can't wait to hear her really laugh, her giggle is just hilarious!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	it was probably around the 3.5 month mark. And her first time she giggled in her sleep for a good 20 mins.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My babies were both full out laughing by 2 months old.  It is an amazing sound!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	:) ahhh what a beautiful sound it is. My daughter started to make little sounds around 3 mths but now @ 5 mths she's sounding off really loud. I don't know what it is but if she's in her crib & you rock it she breaks out in hysterics, can't help but laugh when she does it|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Any day mom! Its the best sounds ever. i cried and called every one. try to get it on tape so you can remember forever.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I wish I knew when she started...she doesn't giggle all the time. She used to squeal and shreek when she was enjoying something. I was able to get a giggle out of her here and there when I tickled her. But I figured out what she likes to laugh at and quite frankly it scares me! Last night she was in her swing and I turned it off and was sitting in front of it making it swing myself and I would stop it at my face and make loud monster noises and she started to laugh...the meaner the sounds the more she would laugh! I have a deranged daughter lol It's funny because new people moved into our building and one day she was squeeling away and the new people came down and knocked on my door to see if everything was ok they thought I was abusing her or something...until they peeked into the living room and saw her squeeling in her exersaucer|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Chloe started laughing.. and I mean those loud, down from the belly laughs at 4.5 months. Before that she would just giggle, but lately its this "omg, you're so hilarious mommy" laugh (at least that's what I like to think she's thinking :)
Qz3sii2caa	Not all babies, but some do. My first son wasn't into the whole fist in the mouth thing or pacifiers. My second son, however, SERIOUS oral baby. If it isn't his fist, it's his fingers, blankets, toys, pillows, shoulders, arms, etc. LOL  He's 6 months old right now and he's constantly gagging himself w/ his fist.     He's sitting with me right now and since my arm ins in the way he's chewing on that. More like rubbing his gums up and down my arm, drooling, yum. Yay teething...|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl is doing the exact same thing, and she'll be 4 months on the 7th!  I swear I'm gonna come a round the corner and the whole thing is gonna be stuck in her mouth one of these days!  She wants absolutely nothing to do with her binky, and gets mad at the fact (I think) that she can't get the whole thing in her mouth!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son did this for a while.  It's so frustrating to watch!  But by the point he was doing it, we were so relieved he wasn't clawing at his eyes anymore, it didn't bother us too much. It passes.|`|4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	My daughter does this too... she is also 3.5 months! I also try to replace it with a toy! I think its normal especially with teething.|`|rAkWoweOaa	My son does that all the time. He is 4.5 months.|`|8TF5UFpWaa	My son is 4.5 months and has been sucking on his fists since he was about a month old.  He has gagged himself more times than I can count... it amazes me how he starts coughing but still won't remove his fingers/fist from his mouth.  He also isn't a fan of having his fist replaced with the binky... he spits it out when I try (and he's learned to spit it out kinda far).  He is starting to eat his fists a little less and instead put everything else in his mouth... toys, blankets, other peoples fingers (he grabs peoples hands and slowly pulls them toward his mouth like they won't notice), and once I had to stop him from putting the cat's tail in his mouth.  At least it makes me laugh.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My almost 4 month old son does this as well. He refuses to take a paci and does not even try to get his thumb in his mouth, he prefers the whole fist! He does this so much that his knuckle on one of his fingers is always bright red .|`|AA10532704	yes, it is very common with babies and it is just a sign to let you know they are ready for teething. each time they put their  fist in their mouth, it means their gums is scratching and putting their fist in their mouth sooth the pain
13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	He will take it eventually if that is all you offer...  Rub the nipple on the roof of his mouth, this stimulates the sucking response.
Lr3lZ4draa	its normal. there's no more room for baby to move, if you're worried though, call you're doctor.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	Yes its normal, there is less room for the baby to move around now so you will feel it alot less|`|cR1WO8Lzaa	As far as I've heard, it's normal for that to happen within the last few weeks.  I was told that since the baby is larger and cramped that they just don't have the room to move around as freely.. but as you said.. when they do move, they are just as strong.    Good luck!
PAjHWRhsaa	Well, whenever I was in high school I was best friends with this guy. And we both liked each other a little more than friends, but we always dated other people. Finally we were both single and we kinda hinted around at dating, but what we had was great and we didn't want to ruin what we had by trying to date unless we were absolutely positive. It's a good thing, I ended up marrying the guy I dated right before me and my bf almost hooked up. Lol. Just sit down and talk to him about it. Explore your options and don't be shy. Tell him that you love being best friends with him, but you also like him a little more. Obviously he does to or he wouldn't have agreed to dating you. But things will be awkward. I don't know for how long or if that will ever go away. But first things first, talk to him. See what's up and see how he is feeling.|`|piI1aWOdaa	you should wirie down what you just said and how you feel about him and either tell him or give him it in a note|`|NwHQCjZsaa	u too r better off as frenz cuz it makes no sense u loose this friendship of stupidness its obvious the relationship is not working ull just end up losing a childhood friend|`|5RoYyprkaa	Dating someone you've been friends with for that long usually doesn't end well. You're so used to being just friends that it makes any other kind of relationship with him awkward. You need to talk to him, and ask him if it's awkward for him.    Sometimes it works out, but it's obviously putting a strain on you now, after such a short time. What's even worse is when you break up with them. Sometimes things go back to being the way they were before, sometimes it goes sour and people don't talk for years and years.
zi9knUCGaa	I found this link through google when I entered Adam Walsh movie:    http://www.ioffer.com/i/ADAM-Story-of-Ad...    When my kids were young, I contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I requested any educational materials they had regarding kidnapping. They provided me with a VHS tape that gave so many different scenerios of ways kids are lured. It was a kid friendly tape. It used language that even my 4 year old could understand. It also provided ways to teach your children how to not become victims. Check out their website and contact them.    What you are doing is being a responsible parent. You should be proud.|`|34gadhWaaa	the dark night|`|5R3bUlnvaa	do what George Lopez did show texas chainsaw massacre|`|zjE2XZ3Daa	home alone.. no wait that might encourage them.    hmm...    mystic river??|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Having them watch a movie like that will traumatize them...just street proof them...but don't make them paranoid....|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	Its probably a little too graphic given their ages, but "Karla" a Canadian movie about a serial killer/rapist is the 'best' movie that comes to mind.  It's a true story about a Canadian couple who kidnapped girls so that the husband could rape and murder them.      Its probably too disturbing for 6 and 7 year olds, but if you waited until they were a bit older, maybe it would work; or you could watch it yourself first and then fastforward through the parts you deemed inappropriate for their ages.    The 'good' part about this particular movie is that the villains look like regular everyday people.  There is nothing that seems out of ordinary about them and on the surface when in public they were nice and polite.  It seems like this is a good point to get across to kids; that even if strangers seem nice on the outside, they might still be evil inside.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Lifetime movie channel...|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Why would you want to scaremonger your children into being fearful of something that is extremely rare. Showing them a movie wouldn't prevent it from happening, most cases like that involve people that the children know anyway.

You want to teach your kids about something that is very real- show them a real story!  There was a girl who was taken from a car wash and it was caught on the security camera.  Also, you can look up stories that were in the news in the recent past about that boy who was kidnapped and held captive in some guy's apartment for 6 years or something insane like that.  I think a movie is a BAD idea.  Movies are just that- movies.  They are meant to entertain and most are fictional.|`|RtiDXKcaaa	MYSTIC RIVER!!!!!!!!|`|RumoQkohaa	man on fire with denzel...its intense tho so watch out not to scare them or if its inappropriate but its good|`|bBSAFsrhaa	toy story 2 woodie gets kidnapped|`|37dbkLvEaa	Season 6, episode 11 "Child Abduction is Not Funny" - South Park|`|LZm9TS29aa	I would take them to see taken.

Enjoy.|`|ea411a2c44df3b7648b1c84f352a4902aa	There was a mini-series (or movie, it's been a long time) on t.v. several years ago, "I Know My First Name is Steven".  A true story about a boy named Steven Staynor - not sure on the spelling of the last name.  He was kidnapped at about the age of 7  and repeatedly raped by a man that posed as his father.  He lived  with this turd of human flesh until he was around 16.    This was a VERY tough presentation to watch - even though the rape/violence wasn't shown - it was off camera - you heard the boy more than anything.  But as an adult, being able to connect the dots....it was heartbreaking to imagine this happening to such an innocent soul, knowing this sort of thing happens every day somewhere.    But how young are your kids?  Are you sure this is the way you want to go?  I'd bet you could find age appropriate books at the library on "Stranger Danger" type subjects.|`|llTqn0Tbaa	let them watch america's most wanted
bL3rzrEYaa	At 4 weeks it is tough, I'm not gonna lie lol. But I was told by the pediatrician that the longer they stay awake during the day, the longer they will sleep at night. However, I know that is so difficult, because nap time during the day gives mommy a chance to get her housework done lol so yea that idea didn't help me out much. Other than that, I don't know of much you can do besides ride it out, because it will get better. My daughter is almost 5 months, and she has been sleeping through the night from 10/11 pm until about 8 am, for about 2 months now.     I'm a big believer in the parenting books, and I have the one What To Expect The First year, and I definitely recommend it to anyone, it's a quick way to find answers to a lot of questions you may have.    Good luck mama and congrats on your little princess!    ***Not sure why I got a thumbs down??? Whatever lol haters.|`|p3saxruGaa	Of course she's going to stay up all night, she's sleeping all the time during the day. I'd keep her up during the day and not make her nap so much so when it's night time she'd be tired and actually sleep.|`|3b3ff67447b873310e5ad46c73b2e37baa	I think 4 weeks is too early to expect her to sleep through the night - try again when she is 8-12 weeks.  eta - swaddling her nice and tightly will help - but really she needs to eat pretty often, so expecting long stretches of sleep is not realistic.|`|lCbsCM6raa	Two books; "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" and "On Becoming Babywise"|`|z4byzsGLaa	You could have a long wait although my daughter started sleeping through the night at 8 weeks!  I was thrilled but it didn't last at about 4 months she started waking up again and she is 11 months and still waking up just to eat and she goes right back to sleep!!  I play soft lullaby music in her room for naps and all night!  She liked to be swaddled when she was younger she always slept longer if swaddled!!|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Well I know several. So I will tell you all that I know. =)    One useful trick if daddy is around at bedtime, is called fathering down. Just before putting the baby to bed, daddy should cradle baby, with babys head resting on his daddys neck. Daddy should then talk to baby in a gentle voice. A males voice is much deeper than a females, and many babies find that deepness soothing, and so will transition into sleep more easily    Another technique is called wearing down. No, this doesnt mean playing with baby until hes so exhausted that he falls asleep on the floor! The idea is for you place your baby in a sling or carrier - wear him, basically - and go about your regular household activities in the lead up to bedtime. This is particularly helpful if baby has been very active and is either too excited to sleep or overtired. Moving about with you helps to rock and soothe baby, and so calm him down in preparation for bedtime.    A more modern option is driving down. Most parents have heard of this trick, which basically involves putting your baby in his car seat and driving around for a while until hes asleep. Unfortunately this is rather inconvenient and uses up petrol, but if youre desperate, its worth a try - it has a very high success rate. When my children were babies, I often used to time driving somewhere or coming home so that it roughly coincided with the start of my babys naptime. Then once we were home Id transfer my baby into his bassinet or crib, and hed have a lovely long nap. Ive been known to take the long route home for just this reason!    Although these techniques are generally successful, obviously you dont want to be obliged to drive around with your baby every night just so hell go to sleep. The idea of these techniques is to start out with these more drastic techniques, to help baby learn the feel of going off to sleep, then gradually ease out of them. Replace driving in a car, for example, with being rocked in the bassinet. Always remember that learning to transition into sleep is a big thing for your baby to learn, and it probably wont happen overnight. With patience and persistence, however, baby will gradually learn how to fall asleep by himself, helping both baby and yourself get a good nights sleep.|`|jNErU39iaa	My daughter is almost 6 months old and sleeps from 7pm to 5am, has a feed, and then goes back to sleep for an hour or two before waking up for the day. She has been in this routine since 12 weeks and has always been a good sleeper.    There is not much you can do to make a baby sleep longer if she is hungry, however - If your baby is just waking because she is restless I can recommend a relaxing warm bath (right before bed) rather than in the morning - baths help a baby relax and become peaceful, lets them know it's night time, which therefore encourages a good nights sleep.     Another tip is using a pacifier. I know a lot of people are 'against' them. But babies have a sucking reflex - even if they are not hungry, often they will want to suck just for the comfort.    You are probably not still wrapping/swaddling your baby, but I would encourage trying to do that as well, babies arm movements and wriggling can disturb and wake them during their sleep (my daughter has only just stopped being wrapped at almost 6 months old!)    Another trick I swear by is washing their clothes and bedding in lavender scented washing powder/wool wash. The aroma helps US sleep, and it does the same with babies, in my experience anyway!    I'm assuming that your daughter knows the difference between night and day, but just make sure you keep the days nice and bright, loud and fun - but don't tire her out. An over-tired baby is harder to get to sleep than one who has regular naps throughout the day.     4 weeks is still pretty young, your baby may not sleep through until around 3-4 months of age, or maybe even later.    Congratulations and Good Luck!|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	She is only 4 weeks if your lucky by three months she will sleep through the night but she must be sleeping too much during the day but you have to wait she also needs her rest. And sleep when she does I know it's easier said then done I have a 5 month old and he wakes once to eat and then goes back to sleep and I am still waiting... people say I should'nt complain others babies this age some wake 2-3 times. others don't sleep until their 1|`|DLDweOcYaa	I was lucky that my daughter started sleeping through the night since she was 8 weeks old and she's now almost 10 months old and still sleeping through the night.  I would suggest starting a routine for her.  I started this when my daughter was 6 weeks old.  For example, bath her at the same time every night, do the same thing after her bath like massage her with baby cream.  Put her clothes on and wrap her up and then put her in her cot/crib.  It took 2 weeks for my baby to recognise the routine and she has slept through the night since then.|`|AA11476951	Try to keep her awake more during the day. It's hard because you can't entertain a 4 week old but you will have to try so she is more tired at night. It is extremely common for newborns to have their days and nights mixed up. You have to teach her she has it backwards.
XCueIYnYaa	10 weeks i heard it, but i saw it at 9.|`|fHjSonssaa	I'm pretty sure it was 9 and some days.  Maybe it was early in the 10th week.  It was in a time frame where it was common to hear it, but also not devestating if you didn't hear it- so a little earlier.|`|kZFov1x6aa	i saw it at my first ultrasound at 7 weeks. i cant remember when i first heard it|`|j73bqzRAaa	well i was 12 weeks when they found it on a ultrasound  but i think u can be like 10 weeks  but to hear on a dopler you have to be a little more far along  but they should be able to pick it up right awy on ulrtasound|`|uSsmriwWaa	I saw it on an ultrasound at 7 weeks. I heart it faintly on a doppler at 9 weeks, 5 days. It's unusual to hear it that early. It can be heard around 10-12 weeks, but some take longer. It all depends on the baby's position and your body.|`|6mhFHSRSaa	I had early ultrasounds because of some bleeding and because of a previous miscarriage. We were able to both see and hear the heartbeat at 6 weeks exactly via transvaginal ultrasound. The ultrasound machine they used was sensitive enough to pick up the heartbeat and amplify it at that time.     The same was true of my transvaginal ultrasound at 9 weeks.    I had another brief scan at more than 12 weeks 2 days. This time, the equipment was older and the scan was abdominal, which meant lower resolution pictures and lower quality data all around. As a result, we didn't hear the heartbeat, but we could see it.     Three days later, when they used the better machine again, I could hear it plain as day!    A lot depends on the ultrasound equipment. If they use newer, stronger equipment and if your baby is developing on schedule, you can sometimes see and hear it earlier than you would otherwise.|`|67zBvnNjaa	7 weeks on ultrasound|`|LOyCUUNmaa	I heard my @ 6wks. Thats early but its possible!!  That may be the earliest.|`|9S2kNyCvaa	Saw and heard it at 8 weeks!
I5AxDuOYaa	Your daughter is only 5 years old and this is the age to start disciplining HARDCORE. I can understand that she can be very annoying but this is the age to be getting on mommy's nerves. (which is completely normal). Do not let your daughter be a fresh mouth and let her debate with you because then she can grow up to be one of those kids that think they know better than there parents at such a young age and trust me if that happens, forget about counting to 10 because you will just throw her out the window! You need to tell her and show her who is the adult here and who is the child. If she is spoiled than you need to start looking at taking things away from her for starters and just scaring her so she will do what you want. This is not being mean, this is being a responsible and normal parent. Scold her if you must, never be afraid of that. Now, the common sense part.  Do not worry! she is only 5 years old! Start worrying when she becomes 8 and has no knowledge. Start teaching her things or tell your husband to start getting involved..hmm did you make her alone? I don't think so. If you need anything else, please let me know! =)|`|fe9483dd4a075a0cb91567684c1e59feaa	By Not Getting Into Fights.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah. That's normal. You know you've done a good job parenting your child when they become so independent so early.   She's only five,so there's still a lot she needs to be taught.You will most likely butt heads for some time to come,but don't loose heart,things will sink in eventually.|`|D4e9jv0iaa	talk to her calmly and try to understand her|`|rkh01QI2aa	just listen...really listen..all she wants is to know u understand.  when talking to her get at eye level, thats very important. time out works, one minute for every year old, and when its over get down eye level and tell her what she did wrong..talking back etc. that show nanny 911 taught me alot, it works on my 2 yr old nephew, i keep everyday....good luck, see if nanny 911 has a web page. ?|`|fdnbXfvfaa	5 year olds don't have common sense mom, you will just have to get used to it|`|aZyfEugvaa	That's really sad that you don't get along with your 5 yr old daughter.... One thing that you said that really bugs me is that "you can handle only so many stupid questions a day" start there, respect her for trying to learn and for being inquisitive. You are her mom teach her, be nicer to her, you probably have an attitude when you talk to her, be sweeter, she wants attention. Spend QUALITY time together, play a game with her....for her sake be nice, and kind. Treat her the way you want to be treated and how you want her to treat others. Remember you have to set an examlpe for her! She is to young to have stress in her life and I'm sure fighting with you makes her sad. Put the effort in and it will work out.|`|rNSM38Jaaa	Shes only 5. I agree with your husband, my friend likes to butt heads with her mother a lot too. It's true when that happens your a lot alike. Practice patience with your daughter and tell her that what you decide is for the best.|`|m2aznd8xaa	first of all at 5 years old there shouldnt be such things as a stupid question.she is 5 they are at a stage where they think they know it all and want things there way.and it will get worse before it gets better . i have a9 year old and she still asks tons of questions gives major attitude and think she is always right. she protests for any little task i give her. but thats a little girl trying to be independent,trying to see how far they can push you. dont give in and dont lash out keep your cool and always answer her questions even if they are silly or something she already knows.kids love to test you.good luck and just try to spend more you and her time and find out alittle more about her she might surprise you.
s4LWmcTjaa	Yes, very normal :-)  Full baby belly = sleepy baby.    My daughter fell asleep on my breast until she was 3 months old.  Ah memories.  I miss those days.  Cherish them.  They are precious.|`|AA11210211	It is very normal,just about every time my son would eat he would fall asleep and I would have to wake him to finish his bottle.My daughter did this a little not often though it was like she was afraid she was going to miss something!!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Very normal!!  That was such a pain trying to keep them awake long enough to eat enough, lol!  Congrats!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Absolutely.  It's very comforting to babies to nurse, even from a bottle.   It relaxes them and when their tummies are full they are generally very content and therefore sleepy.    I've yet to meet a baby that doesn't fall asleep during feedings, at least babies under 4 or 5 months old.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  yesvery normal.    Mum always tells me. she had to wake me to feed me. All i wanted to do was sleep. And when she was feeding me id fall back to sleep.. She could walk around. make noise talk. i was always asleep.  My sister was the complete opposite. One little noise, shed wake up and want to eat again.    god bless x|`|Qz3sii2caa	Totally normal and extremely adorable. They don't call breast milk "knockout juice" for nothing. :-)     It'll continue until your baby gets off the breast/bottle.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	This is totally normal. I'm dealing with the same thing and my daughter is 1 week and 2 days old. What happens is the baby gets too comfortable and so in return they fall asleep. A nurse advised me that if I didn't think she was getting enough to eat, then to undress her and feed skin to skin. (I'm strictly nursing) but this could help with bottle feeding as well because she won't get as comfortable during feedings. Good luck!|`|puCOYwMmaa	I don't have any personal experience yet but it sounds normal.  Breastfeeding is probably soothing for her and add a full stomach to that and she's sure to fall asleep!|`|avx7bLnKaa	yes, just as long as she is gaining weight, has alot of pee and poop diapers|`|3b3ff67447b873310e5ad46c73b2e37baa	absolutely normal - and fine - as long as she is gaining weight...|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I could hardly keep my baby awake enough to eat!  I would literally have to strip her down and tickle her to get her to stay awake long enough to nurse!  That lasted about a month!  After that, she would fall asleep, but would nurse while sleeping.  She became a little multi-tasker:  nap time and eating time all at once so she wouldn't miss out on anything while she was awake!|`|AA11476951	Totally normal. Try changing her diaper in the middle of the feeding. The cold wipey on their bottom usually does the trick... for a few minutes anyway.
hVY2AWEbaa	it could've been late due to stress. or the fact that you were worried about being pregnant, but just to be sure, take a test .|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    yes could have possibly been breakthrough bleeding.    symptoms : cramping , Bleeding lighter than usuall period.  take test when ready  god bless x|`|ry3yUnoaaa	It's now February you should have gotten a pregnancy test a long time ago. Pregnancy is nothing to play a guessing game with. Get a test ASAP, because if you decide to not keep it, you will need to do it sooner than later.|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	If you had your period even if it was only 3 days, you may be okay. That being said, some women do have their period throughout pregnancy. I would recommend getting a pregnancy test.
lG1j8t2Aaa	I am a mother of 3 wonderful children-most of the time. their ages are 4(next week), 34 months, and 20.5 months. So I can so relate to you, and too I live in an apartment and their father and I were separated so he has the car and I have nothing. When I was pregnant with my last child I sat my girls down and asked them if they would like another sister or a brother. The oldest was all up for it but the baby hated the idea from day one. So we played a game with it. I marked the due date on the calendar, and every time I went to the doctor and had an ultrasound they were the first ones to see it. Also they would color the baby a picture everyday, and they each had 15 mins of baby time where they could talk to the baby. At least that way a couple times a day I got to sit down for 15 mins. When I was closer to having him I told them names and they got a chance to kinda help name him. Try to find an activity, nickjr.com, is good to have easy and cheap ideas to have fun.Maybe get a few magazines with pictures of babies and let them look at how they react with their siblings. Good luck and may God bless you.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Unfortunately you really can't explain that to a two year old and have them actually understand it.   This is all part and parcel of having kids close together.  Believe me I know, I spaced my kids only two years apart from each other.   But remember, your daughter is just being a two year old.  It's not her "fault" that your pregnant so you're going to have to do your best to remain patient.   Do you know anyone else with a kid around your daughter's age?   It might help her to have a playmate.|`|J7GTIE5raa	WOW   i had my kids close in age but not like that. you need to get your tubes tied and find a husband. you sound pretty young too.    take some time to find a baby sitter like 2 days out the week and stop having kids you are lettin stress u out.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	I have a 4 year old who did the same thing. Eventually she will shut up. I just take her outside to play in the yard.
qyObFvz6aa	It's not wrong to have multiple showers, however, the difference is in the guestlist. It would suck if the majority of the people on your guestlist will be going to the other baby shower first. They won't be too thrilled about going to two showers unless they are all super close friends and family. Sometimes people do a shower for co-workers and another one for family and friends. But it doesn't sound like the case here.    Of course you are hurt and angry. It hurts to have all of your planning and effort bumped to second place when you didn't even know you had any competition. It's clear that your friend could stand to be more assertive, although her explanation sounds more like an excuse--no one can force anyone to do anything they don't want to do.    That being said, you did spend alot of time and money, and you did it because you want to celebrate your friend's pregnancy. If I were you, I would go through with the shower and re-evaluate the friendship afterwords. I'm sure you will remain friends but maybe you shouldn't invest so much into the friendship if she's not going to value your efforts.|`|ElkcUb8Eaa	I'd feel a little hurt/angry. Are the people invited different then the ones at the first shower? If so, I'd continue planning and throw it so you don't hurt/offend her and cause any bad feelings. If it seems to be mostly the same people I wouldn't see any point as I wouldn't attend the same persons shower, especially for the same baby! And I would explain that to her.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	no i completely understand your feeling! i'm sorry to hear this.    seems to me like she is being selfish and greedy.    since you spent all of that money it would only make sense to carry on with the baby shower...hmm i don't know!?    i'm so sorry!|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	Absolutely not. Your friend should be SO grateful that you put so much effort into something for her, and should recognize that you're a terrific friend.|`|TDOfjYGBaa	No it's not wrong to have two showers. As long as the guests aren't the exact same otherwise what do you expect for them to go shopping twice? i can see why your mad but it really all depends on whether or not the  guest list is the same.|`|6XSOVAh0aa	If its the same guest list, I'd cash in the tickets and go someplace else.  Send a gift/gift card and wish her well.  It would be different if yours was the first one, but it is not.  And, if its the same guest list, what's the point?|`|256cVXsmaa	No definitely not, when you are putting so much effort into being a great friend for someone it is totally normal to feel hurt by their actions.  She isn't thinking about how much you are doing for her or how much you are spending on this because she is to busy thinking of herself right now.  Honestly I think she will come to her senses and realize she hurt you.  I can't imagine doing everything you have done for a friend and realizing that she already has one planned, I mean whats the point?  If she apologizes I suggest you go on with your shower that you planned, you seem to have put a lot of effort and hard work in it so just be proud of yourself for everything.  If she seems inconsiderate then cancel it and take a trip to hawaii =D|`|X2G8EHBlaa	no ur not but consider her feelings|`|PLK1p8cUaa	I understand how you are feeling but it was up to her to let her friends know that a shower was being planned by you, her special friend.  If she did not try to encourage them to wait then that was her doing.  How good of a friend is she to you and do you wish to maintain this friendship?  If so then go ahead and continue with your plans.  If you have changed your mind then do so now so the other shower guests can be invited to the other one.  You can send her a gift for the baby.  I personally had three showers given to me for my last baby.  One by my husbands family, one by my family and one by co-workers.  My husband was also given a small one at his work.  A shower is to celebrate the coming baby and all are welcomed.  Good luck in your decision.    P.S.  No one but you can validate your feelings.  You feel what you feel.|`|9kPPmazoaa	You have to remember you are doing this for the baby. The more showers the more gifts for the baby. I understand why your upset. But just because shes having another shower. Doesnt mean what your doing is not appreciated. Someone else (like you) may have wanted to throw her a shower as well. If you have 50 people that want to attend. Don't cancel, it sounds like you've put alot of work into this... go forward with it, it sounds like its going to be amazing. Your a very good friend.    I had 3 showers for my daughter. I never asked for that many... People "wanted" to have them for me. Every one was different and I truly appreciated everything that was done for me. As your friend will when she sees the trouble you have went through for her.    I see nothing wrong with having more than one shower. Granted your not inviting the same people over and over again trying to bleed them dry.    In my case.... My job threw one shower, My mother threw the other and my MIL threw the other. All different groups of people. And I never "asked" for a shower at all.    If its the same people invited. I would cancel the shower and get your money back (cause thats just wrong) But if your shower has different people you may want to keep it. Because they are expecting to attend the shower your throwing.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It's not wrong to have multiple showers, however, you're putting a lot into this and I think she'll understand if you cancel yours.  Just tell her in time to make sure that the people who were invited to yours still have the chance to get invited to the other one.
PLK1p8cUaa	You are thinking way too much about it all.  Relax it is almost over.  Good luck.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i really doubt it.    just some weird twitch you've got going on! haha|`|vksS59WJaa	maybe your carzy j/k|`|BU3A3rR4aa	no u fine|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Sounds like the baby is resting on a nerve. When I was pregnant my right index finger started twitching off & on while I was at work for the entire day & I also experienced the twitching in my legs coming on to the last few weeks. The doc said it was because of where the baby was resting on a nerve|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	That has happened to me before and people told me it was due to dehydration.  Drink some more water girl!|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I'm pretty sure there's nothing wrong with you.  When I was pregnant, my legs would twitch...constantly!!!  I don't know the reasoning behind it, but it went away after I had my daughter.    Good Luck!|`|MqFeJiukaa	I really think it is pure coincidence.
qUTmN23Raa	i had this early on too. i think its an adrenaline rush to protect the baby. it kinda felt like electricity. pretty much scared the crap out of me. i also know your baby is well protected in your tummy. not much can hurt it from the out side. and it could be stretching. your body is getting ready for ALOT of changes|`|jgtfWjE4aa	i believe at 18 weeks you're not suppose to lay on your back because it cuts off blood flow to the heart.    anyway, i'm sure it was normal.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	well laying on your stomach is fine....i sleep that same way and im 20 wks pregnant, its just uncomfortable. it might have just been a nerve or something.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I get those too.  My doctor said its from low potassium, eat lots of potassium rich foods like bananas and potatoes along with taking your prenatals!  Or if it was closer to your uterus it could have been round ligament pain which is also very normal.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	ask doc
eKtEWrcmaa	I'm very glad I was an only child. My mom and I are very close because of it. There were never siblings to compete with for attention, etc. Lots of quality time and the ease of going on family trips with just one child.     There are usually concerns about a child being more selfish, lonely, etc but really with proper parenting you shouldn't have a problem.     I was never lonely as a child. I had friends at school that I could play with, etc.     I do think that I grew up faster and was more mature than my friends who had siblings. I get along much better with adults that are years older than me and always have. There were a lot of adults in my life when I was growing up and they always treated me like I was older and not just another one of the little kids. I used this to my advantage as I got older. While my friends with siblings were partying and acting like kids I was buying my first home and starting a non profit and working with people 10+ years older than me with ease.     Only children tend to be more imaginative which I think can also be used as a positive as they get older.|`|DdOtU7Nyaa	I think its great for kids to have siblings. but wait a couple of years till  1 is more independent, it'll be easier for you. Plus, let me tell you, the worst thing you can do to a kid is have a sibling close to their age. having a sibling with a 4+ age differnence is cool, but any less that and sparks will fly.    and its nice having a big bro too :>
yFLBDwMgaa	PUBERTY.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	Honey, that's totally normal. It's fine and fun to be interested in girls. Picturing them naked is normal too. Masturbation- a LOT of boys do it, 98%!    If you wanna know more, try health websites like kidshealth.com, in the teen section.|`|HwI6iwDOaa	yes its normal, get used to it|`|etzhw4j7aa	of course its normal EVERYONE does it
qUTmN23Raa	yes. very you might think your period is going to come... but it wont dont react to it like a period no heeting pads on your stomach.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	Yes cramping is normal. As long as it isn't accompanied by bleeding or really severe pains. If you are concerned contact your dr.|`|i69nprxXaa	I found out I was pregnant early as well and I did have alot of cramping in the beginning but as you get further along it will go away...
qPCjUckvaa	If you've got a second, positive line, then you're pregnant.  The positive line may never be as dark as the control line.  These strips are different from ovulation strips where the line gradually gets darker; with these type of pregnancy strips, any line at all (as long as you read it within the specified amount of time) means it's positive.  It doesn't depend on the darkness of the line, just if the line is there or not!  Congrats and best wishes:)
nyF4GRTvaa	Hi. I work for a health video website called icyou.com which has lots of videos on all sorts of health issues. To answer your question: yes, it is dangerous to water down baby formula. Here is a link to a video we created that explains why:    http://icyou.com/topics/health-wellness/...    I hope this helps!|`|HclKftzAaa	yes it is dangerous. baby formula is made so that it gives the baby the right amount of nutrients. watering it down means that they don't get enough nutrients and therefore are not being fed enough.    They could starve to death.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	If you use concentrated or powder formula you have to add water. So I'm not certain what you are getting at. If you mean using a much higher water to formula ratio, then yes that would be bad.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Yes, extremely!  A baby's kidneys can't handle all kinds of water, they're not supposed to get any extra water, except for maybe if you doc tells you to, if your baby had diarrhea!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	yes it is- make it up to the correct dosage. if the formula u are using appears to thick for your little one, then change brands!!|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Yup.. Its EXTREMELY dangerous. And I know the story you're talking about. It's sad because she didn't have the money to buy formula and was trying to make it last longer by watering it down. But it deprives the child from all the vitamins and nutrients that are needed to thrive. I think when your child's health is in jeopardy because you don't have money to buy food, then it's definitely time to turn to the government for some help. There are many resources available to help out struggling moms..    And I have officially gone off and ranted... bottom line... yes, very dangerous|`|Y3dFm6uGaa	Listen to  1.     Formula is formulated so that the baby gets the right nutrients,  Watering it down would deprive the baby of the nutrition it needs    Don't consider doing that!.|`|qyObFvz6aa	Yes, it's dangerous because the baby can become over-hydrated.|`|AA11885437	yes, of course it is. You mix a certain amount of formula with a certain amount of water to provide the right amount of nutrition so the baby can live and grow. If you water it down, the baby is not getting enough nutrition for one, and for two the extra water can throw off the baby's electrolyte balance and can cause seizures and even death in extreme cases. People who do things like that are just crazy, especially when you can get formula for free through WIC.
W1p6LetFaa	I am also 37 weeks pregnant today with baby  1 and I feel the exact same way!  It's awful!  I feel useless since I am so big that I can hardly move and I feel completely unattractive.  I've been initiating sex with my hubby throughout the entire pregnancy and now that I feel like such a blimp, I could really use the encouragement from him but no such luck.  I just want to cry.  I think at this point, just take comfort in knowing that you are most definitely NOT alone!  I think this might also be our hormones changing again as our bodies are gearing up for labor.  It will be over soon enough.  Treat yourself to a nice bubble bath (just not too hot) or just do something nice for yourself.  I took a long nap today just because I could, and I felt a lot better.  Or try to find an easy task around the house that makes you feel useful, that also helped me (I folded my husbands boxers.  Completely pointless, but made me feel helpful since I can't do much else around the house anymore).  Also, have you tried talking to your husband?  Sometimes it helps to get these frustrations out in the open and/or you might be pleasantly surprised by how he responds when he realizes you are feeling so down!  Best wishes to you, your hubby, and your little one!  You're almost there!|`|TGzOrftPaa	Try taking a friend and just going to the mall or shopping, even for a little while.  Buy yourself something to wear to the hospital that you feel cute in.  Maybe a pair of fuzzy slippers to wear during labor or something!  Watch a funny tv program or some comedy.  That helps lighten your mood.  However, if you can't shake the feeling soon or if you've been feeling like this for awhile, talk to your doc!  It's ok.  Some women get hormones and stuff worse than others and worse than just the normal pregnancy blues.  It's alright to go in and ask her about some help.  You just don't want that to continue because being down in the dumps isn't any fun.  Sometimes it also helps just to talk to someone about it.  Maybe a friend, relative?      Good luck!  And just keep thinking that in a couple weeks you'll be holding a beautiful baby and it will be worth it.|`|GDobAMQ8aa	You get past it by having the baby and then recovering.  Until then, you just have to try to make the best of it.    As for the sex thing, have you tried initiating sex with him?  It could be that he's doing the guy thing and worrying that having sex might hurt the baby (or hurt you).  Maybe you assuring him (and initiating) would bring him around?|`|8ifHo5F3aa	Sorry to hear that you feel that way! but cheer up you are almost there!!!  unlike me 20 weeks no boyfriend he dumped me four weeks ago but even then when we were together wed only have sex like twice a month... So cheer up! its not that bad at all!  Congrats!
mCM0pml0aa	he will be completely fine! I was in the same situation... all that happens is the next shots are a little later than preferred. But it doesn't do anything to them. Some parents don't even get their kids vaccinated.|`|b5JnSBstaa	You can try contacting your states Department of Health. Most will offer free vaccine clinics for babies and young children. I live in NY and lost my insurace for a couple of months and needed to have my son vaccinated. I just called their office and they told me where the nearest clinic would be and when they would be there.  In my state they are only at my location once a month, so you kinda have to plan ahead. Give them a call and they can help you. My son's vaccines didn't cost anything at the clinic.|`|mdyuUjDxaa	He'll be okay.   I've never got my son vaccinated, ever, but that is my perogative. I would never preach to you about it. I'm just saying that if my 13 month old son has not gotten a terminal illness or died without having them, then your son should be just fine.     My mother never got me any either until I was 12 and I had to have MMR to stay in school, later on I got the tetanus shot. We're all okay, so I am sure your son will be|`|FdQD8H3qaa	mostly as long as they have them by the time they go to school it's fine.. There is a makeup list for missed shots so don't worry about it.... For me I have put some of my son's shots off because I feel that they give out to many at one time to such a little baby.... I get a lot of grief given to me by the Dr. but I don't care!!!  He will get all of his shots before he starts school but I'm not pumping so much into him at once!  When I was little kids got something like 35 shots by the time they were 3 and now it's like 250!  That's crazy to me!!|`|Ezkn5azdaa	It wouldn't hurt your child to have those shots while the insurance getting figured out. I know my health department where I live give out free shots but would have to pay 10 dollars for admission fee that it. Show them the shots that he already got and the ones he need and they can do it. I don't know if you have health department where you live that does that.
SohrsIBoaa	im so sorry to hear that. it must be hard, but remember.. you will have your own family one day. and its your choice how big you want to make it. but for now talk to your mom, maybe she can adopt? good luck buddy.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	When you get married, your spouse's family will also become your family. The 2 friends you meet in high school that you keep in your life, those are the people that will matter to you. It does suck that you missed out on the sibling experience, but you have a lot to be thankful for and a lot of things are yet to come.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Not much you can do about it. Really being an only child is not the end of the world.     I'm an only only child in my extended family also. Most of my aunts/uncles have 4-7 kids.     I prefer being an only child. You get more attention, less arguing with siblings, etc.     You have plenty of cousins you can talk to. You'll have your own family also. When they pass you'll also be the only one to inherit anything. Not that money is the most important thing but many many fights break out between siblings after parents pass. My aunts and uncles were all horrid after my granddad passed. Its been over a year and its still going on.     There are many good things about being an only child!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Being mad won't solve a thing, so what you have to do is create the family you desire when you get older and get married.  Have lots of kids and enjoy THEIR memory making years.|`|m2aznd8xaa	im sorry to hear you feel that way. how old are you now, and how about your mom. you do and should talk about it with your parents. if they dont or cant have more children. than all you can do really is make a family of your own . meet someone who wants lots of kids.and a girl with lots of sibilings is good too because youll have lots of brother in laws and sister in laws.there isnt much you can do to change it if your parents wont have more kids. when you get married you can have lots of kids and youll never be alone because when they grow up they will always visit you with there kids.my husband loves my brothrs like they where is own and they talk to each other all the time when they need advice to hang out together,everything brothers do they do.so just remember you can always start a big family of you own. keep your head up and think of the future.you can share memories with your wife to be and start new ones with your family.and when you become a dad youll be a great dad because youll want them to make great memories ,something you think you never had. youll be okay youll see.|`|TyZ3OX0Oaa	Perhaps by the time your parents pass away you will have a children of your own to share your memories with.     Don't be upset about being an only child. There are people who aren't only children who barely keep in touch with their siblings anyway.|`|N9qwjxUlaa	I'm an only child too, and I've always wanted a sibling. Everyone tells me I'm lucky to be an only child because I get more attention and less arguments, but I really don't feel lucky - when I get older, I won't have someone really close to me to help out anytime, someone to share memories with, and someone to fight with but still love inside. Friends and cousins just aren't the same, and none of my cousins are my age anyway. Most of them are way older than I am, like 48 or something and I'm 14. So I totally get how you feel. But there's no easy way out of it.    You should talk to your mom about it...just tell her that you don't like being an only child and see if she can help somehow. I dunno. But she'll understand.
cJfJd9yaaa	In reality there is no safe time to have sex without protection if you are not on birth control.  I ended up getting pregnant 4 days after I ovulated so the whole 14 day rule is farcical.  You can have sex without a condom while on BC medication as long as you have been on it for at least 3 weeks continuously, take it at the same time each day and remember that that pill is only 99% effective so there is a very small chance that you could become pregnant.    Realistically, millions of women have unprotected sex while on birth control pills and never ended up pregnant.  It worked for me for 10 years and I only got pregnant when I went off them and wanted to get pregnant.    Dont worry about all these other, self righteous, get-married-before-you-have-sex fanatics.  You will be fine.|`|yipMDefBaa	There is a method called the rhythm method.  Interestingly enough its the form of contraception that the pope promotes.  The chances of getting pregnant while on the pill is very very low, but it does happen.  Especially if you accidentally miss a dose, are on certain antibiotics or have bad diarrhea/vomiting for a few days.    The safest way is a. don't have sex (just not realistic) or B. to be on the pill and use condoms (now where is the fun in that).  Using the rhythm method is not very reliable at all.  I heard somewhere the success rate is only 60-70%.  The pulling out method is not that reliable because there can be sperm in the fooling around bit.    I suggest talking to your DR or going to a relevant clinic and talking through your options with a qualified person who knows all the pros and cons then decide what you are going to do.    You do need to do something or there is a good chance you will be a opps sh*it I'm pregnant.    ADDIT: I agree with an above post condoms is the safest against stds and don't presume hes your only partner or has been in the past.  unfortunately and sadly people lie.|`|JvoYCwyFaa	You just turned 18 and you want to risk not wearing a condom? How old is your boyfriend? Don't consider any relationship out of marriage monogamous..and even then there are risks. Consider your past questions about pregnancy scares and answer this yourself.  Jesus! And youve only been together 4 months..Comon girl! Foolish..Foolish....|`|PBJ8gZccaa	talk to your obgyn, she can help you better understand your ovulation cycle.     i personally always use condoms even though i'm on the pill.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	It all depends on what STDs you think are safe to get? You know  genera aids herpes you know the gifts that keep on giving!|`|834IgNzRaa	Honestly there is no "safe" time not to use a condom, wel unless he pulls out then yu should be fine. Yu should use one regardless if your on the pill. Once yu come on your monthly yu should always wait a week after it to have sex otherwise there's a strong possibility yu can get pregnant.........
qPCjUckvaa	Lower back, shoulder blade, or back of your neck are best for women because those areas won't be stretched during pregnancy.  Make sure you get your tattoo at least a year before you get pregnant, so it has plenty of time to fully heal and set; your skin probably will act weird once you're pregnant (I know most women say they have weird skin reactions during their pregnancy), and it may cause the the dye to give you a different color/image than you wanted.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Your back would be a good place.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	Your scalp.    I know that wasn't very helpful, but that's the only sure place that skin doesn't stretch.  Even palms of hands and soles of feet stretch during weight gain.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Keep looking sweetie.  Depending on you and the pregnancy, you can stretch pretty much everywhere, especially if you retain a lot of fluid.      PS...Steer clear of the belly-button piercings too, they are not nearly as cute after pregnancy.  A friend of mine had one and now it looks like a weird scar above her belly button.  (She lost all her weight and is actually thinner now than before she got pregnant, but it still looks gross.)|`|SGeo7cqYaa	Sorry girl, but everything stretches! But try the back! Good luck!!!! wish me the same! Pregnant with baby number 2 due in October ( more like September!!!!)|`|EULVtVDvaa	I don't know but I would not do it .... I would wait until well after you have had baby .|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	All women are different and gain their weight differently during pregnancy so its hard to tell.
Y7jUD6Pyaa	My mom passed may 24th, 2005, i was 15, she died of a rare cancer called leiomysarcoma. The last time i saw my mother was the day she had died. I went to a high school, and the hospital she was in was right next to the school, so during my lunch break i left school and went to go visit her. I went up the the room and went in. She was laying in the bed, she had an expression on her face that i will never forget. She was in so much pain. i came up close to her. I can't remember if i kissed her check or not, but i do remember i held her hand. She looked at me in the eye, i tried so hard to hold back the tears. Its like she knew she was going to die that day. She pulled her hand away from mine and turned her head the other way, she was hurting and i knew it. she didnt want me to see her like that. I told her that i loved her and that she'd get better soon. I can't remember exactly but i think i said "see you later" later that day, i was walking with my friends and my grandfather came and picke me up and told he she had passed.  I have soo many fond memories of her. I cant put my finger on one specific  haappy moment becuase we shared soo many. She was a wonderful women, who loved to just have fun and be silly and goofy. She used to take me and my brother EVERYWHERE, sometimes after school she'd helps us get our homework finished and then tell us to get in the car and we wouldnt know where we were going, and we'd arrive at a movie theater or arcade or something like that. she loved seeing us happy. She cried at everyone of my birthdays. Even when i got my first...visit from Aunt Flow, she just smiled and said "my baby is growing up" and she started crying lol. she had the most amazing smile. i loved ever moment i spent with her. I caused her alot of frustration sometimes, you know the typically teenage stuff, but not one moment did she ever feel that i didnt love her becuase i did, and i always told her. I hear teens tell their mothers that they hate them, i couldnt even bring myself to say that word around her. She was my best friend. i wish we were closer and i wish i could have told her more things about me, and tell her my secrets. I agree with you completely. You never know, cherish the moments you have while you still got them. I regret plenty of things that i did, and i regret ever causing her the stress that she felt dealing with my BS. I miss her dearly tho.    http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf... (if you have a myspace this is her pic! she looks like an angel here!)        I see that you have a child now too. I have a son, do you ever feel like her sometimes when your talking to your baby, like sometimes ill say something to him, and i hear her. Not only with him, but sometimes i say something and ill be like "omg that sounded just like my mom, or something she'd say" It been extrmemly hard to move on, but now that i have my son, i feel soo much closer to her, closer then ever before (since she passed)|`|RfHHkBMwaa	My mother passed away January 3, 2006; my happiest moment was taking my mom to Hawaii for her 50th birthday in 1990.  We spent 10 days together with my baby brother.  I had one a trip at my job that paid for everything.  Airfare, hotel, rental car and spending money. Only out of pocket expense was meals and souvenirs.  My brother and I vividly remember going to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Volcano National Park, taking a helicopter ride over Akaka Falls.|`|o8uGsZxmaa	My mums not dead but I haven't hugged her and told her how much I love her in a long time ....    *runs downstairs to go hug mum*    Oops she's asleep ... maybe later =D|`|R4kMZrRiaa	When i recovered from anorexia  she was SOOO happy.    And she comes into my room every morning and hugs me and says i love you.  so, a couple of hours ago.  :)|`|LJHbP8Npaa	Awww I'm sorry =(. I really don't know what i would do without my mum!!     I was thinking about the best time with me mum, and i have actually realized i haven't really got any good memorable times with her =/. I have been to caught up in my own life, doing whatever i want, whether she likes it or not, so we haven't had the best relationship. The best time i can think of is this morning, going having a nice convo with her about last night. Just having a laugh and joke.     You know your question has actually made me realize i really should spend more time with her and start to appreciate her more. If (touch wood) she did pass away anytime soon, i would regret our relationship so much! Because my mum is an amazing woman =).     The last time i told her i loved her and gave her a cuddle is last night. I came home (admittedly a little drunk) after a night out, and went into her room were she was sleeping and gave her a big long hug and told her i loved her =). Maybe that isn't the nicest thing to do, but yeah!     Thankyou =) x|`|TgfSqo9maa	lol...my mum pretty much hates me (dead serious here), so there would be really no point, lol. She would just tell me how useless and what a stupid girl I am for hugging her and telling her how much I love her.    Also, it would be like sucking on lemons to say that I loved her...because from what she's done over the years, I can't possibly. Sorry about my little rant...it's been 27 years....    Kelly
GGH0HVdvaa	you guys are way too young for sex anyhow, so he should just tell her that he wants to wait until they're older. if she's a girl who's worth waiting for, she'll understand. if she's a b*tch and dumps him, then he's better off without her.|`|hswTS1jVaa	He doesn't need to tell her anything about not going through puberty.  They are very young and the only things he needs to say is that he's not ready for sex.  There is too much pressure from the media/internet, etc, but honestly he should wait.|`|C5pVfdzwaa	His girlfriend is a twit.  If he's not ready, he doesn't need to be having sex.  It's not that important to his social status and he has the next 70 years of his life to do it.  You don't get good at it until you get older anyway.

hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Jules,     Possum is absolutely right. Guardianship is probably the best option in this situation.    Here are some links that you can share with your parents:  http://www.guardianship.org/  http://www.cwla.org/advocacy/2006legagen...  http://www.ehow.com/how_14205_give-tempo...      Good luck to all of you. I hope things work out for the best!|`|zLoyo24Taa	Your parents do not need to adopt her, they can become her legal guardians. This will allow them to take her to the doctor or to sign papers for school. Good Luck.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	I would say legal guardianship.|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	You don't need to adopt her.  Perhaps your parents could look at gaining legal guardianship of her.  Get them to look into it.|`|2wyDALHgaa	If you and your parents are willing to take her in thats great but you will not be able to adopt her unless her parents are willing to legally surrender their parental rights.  Fact is, by the time they do this and it works its way through the courts...assuming that they were willing, she would most likely be close enough to 18 that it wouldn't make a difference other then emotionally.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	Don't adopt her. Let her live with you for a year and then she can get emancipated.|`|xVahGNYyaa	I agree it would be better to be a legal guardian but if you did go down this line don't rush into it.|`|biqMTkWbaa	I agree with what possum said.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	I'm also in agreement on the legal guardianship issue.

Zu7GJeU4aa	Tell your mam she could get you pretend meat it tastes the same (I'm a veggie)|`|na9nG47zaa	I think your mom has her own opinion, as do you. I don't know how old your brother is, but if he has his driver's license, you can ask him to take you to the store and buy you food that is suitable to you. If he can't drive, then you should confront your mom. Your mom is supposed to be there to support you, and if she's not then that's really not right. Talk to your mom one on one, and say something like, "Mom, did you ever have anything that you really wanted to do really badly? Well, being a vegetarian is a personal goal I've set for myself, and I really want to do this. It's not because of peer pressure, it's because of me feeling better about myself. Vegetarians can eat pizza and different things, just not meat. I would really appreciate it if you would support me on this, because I'm guessing if you had a big personal goal you wanted to achieve, you would have wanted people supporting you too." I hope that helps! I'm sorry about what you're going through :(|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	If you want to be successful at anything then you have to learn to forget the people around you, if you are hungry, then find yourself something to eat, dont look to someone who doesnt care for your choice of lifestyle, if you are truly doing it for you, then the opinion of your mom and brother shouldnt matter, use success as the best method for revenge, once they see how dedicated you are to this and how well you do in it then they will lay off of you.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Why don't you first try with slowly slimming down your intake of meat? Maybe stop eating red meat, only eat chicken?    Or you could offer to try to cook meals with more veggies than meat- like a veggie stir fry or something.    Good luck. Your mom probably thinks you are criticizing her cooking.|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	i say that if you feel that strongly about is as you do, then stick with it and prove to them that its not just a phase.  (also its mountain out of a mole hill!)|`|jaaeQJv9aa	I think its cool that your making a commitment like that, and I have a couple friends who are vegetarians too. I wouldnt recommend confronting them because I doubt it would do any good- if you can try not to paying any attention to him for harassing you about it. People harass other people to get a rise out of them, if you don't give him the satisfaction he will most likely get bored with it.|`|9TqwKPkuaa	I think you should confront them in a polite yet sure way and speak your mind.|`|szuxMXlsaa	the saying is a mountain out of a mole hill :)|`|Ny5NGBCRaa	Care full...i saw a documentary that has proven that w/o proper meat consumption your body will start to row vagina sores all over your skin...before you know it it can consume you and cause you to permanently turn into a giant vagina|`|jg5yg2ojaa	Well just do what you want to do. Here is an off topic but I wanted to build a computer to overclock and I stopped dreaming about it and finally did it. I just sat there for the whole weekend researching and going on forum boards, If you really feel your parents are not supporting them tell them. Just confront them say that if your not going to be willing to help me out on this then I am gonna buy food myself. AND ACtually do it because if you just bluff like that than they will not take your serious.  Your parents care about you and make sure you get your protein|`|snsRyuqyaa	Well you need to inform your mum if you only eat salad you won't get enough protein. Tell both your mum and your brother your personal reasons for doing this and how you really need both their support. People can be ignorant sometimes, so we need to inform them|`|mH26I4f2aa	Im not agenst Vegitarians but i think your mom doesn't suport it is because your mom isn't subject to change. I have had simulare problems because my mom doesn't like the change i have forced on her. Don't worry what people think, its your life and **** them if they don't like it. They don't have to be a vegitarian so y do they care about your life style change.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	Well, I personally never saw a reason to be vegetarian(the animal is dead, whether you eat it or not) but I think you just need to confront them. Tell them that this is what you have decided to do and they can't stop it (if she thinks you just eat salads, eat some cereal or something in front of her and rub it in her face! HA!). So.....yeah. I hope I helped or something.|`|HOdblqIkaa	If I were you I would sit down with my mom and explain to her my reasoning for wanting to be a vegetarian. There are different kinds of vegetarians including those who eat eggs fish and milk and those who eat nothing animal related. Tell her its not just for the added health benefits but because its something you support and want to continue doing for yourself. Ask her if she wouldn't mind picking up more fresh vegetables at the store, some rice and teriaki sauce so you can make a stir fry, or ingrediants to make a vegetarian lesagna for the whole family. I'm sure its not that she doesn't support your decision she probably has no idea what to cook for one person who eats different then the rest of the family. Print out recipes for vegetarian meals and offer to cook once or more a week. Then on days that she cooks you can have leftovers for yourself. If she still is not going to go for that explain to her that cutting down on meat products and adding fresh fruits and vegetables and beans to your diet really cuts calories, is more heart healthy, will give her more energy, and really cuts down on the grocery bill. It might take a while for her to understand where you are coming from but if you are patient, yet persistent, I think she will come around.|`|p5QooWXzaa	It sucks when you dont have supportive parents or siblings but you have to end up doing things on your own look up recipes, get a job to buy things you need to make the food you love. go for what you want.     If you want them to understand it mayeb u can sit them down and print out some information on what being a true vegetarian really means and maybe they'll begin to understand what it really means to you    and if you are doing it because everyone else is doing it .. which i highly doubt . you should never do anything just because others do it .. nobody likes a follower|`|R0Mgjkgzaa	Hi. For whatever reason you want to be a vegetarian is your choice. My sister became a veggie at age 16 because she didn't like the looks of meat. I think you should confront them on not supporting you in your decision. Maybe if you talk things through with them, it might help them understand your feelings. No, I don't think you are being a drama Queen. It's frustrating when people don't support you in something you believe in.    If in the end you don't follow through with the vegetarian thing, just keep moving forward. From how you said" in my short time being alive" you are a young person and have time to follow through with thing and succeed. Just keep moving forward with your goal and someday, the feeling of failure will cease to exist.    Hope all turns out ok.  Cheers!  V
Ep0CpwDbaa	I think Spanish sounds like a good choice, but it depends. Would this count as a high school credit course or would you still have to take Spanish again in high school for the foreign language credit? Where do you live? I think that if it's a high school credit course, then I would go for it. My daughter is in 7th grade and she takes Spanish for high school credit. Also, we live in Texas, so knowing Spanish is very handy. Even if you live in a largely non-Spanish speaking area, Spanish can still be useful in later life.    As for the others, it depends on your interests. I think Gateway to Technology might appeal to me personally, but then again I work as a computer programmer. Art could also be another good choice. Computer Applications doesn't sound very interesting to me - as long as you know how to basically use Word and Powerpoint then you should be good. So I would just recommend taking Spanish and then another one that appeals to you most.|`|yV8fog7Paa	Find out what credits you need.   That's what helps you.   If in JR high you don't need credits, do Spanish and Art.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	gateway to Tech. sounds like its part of Comp.Apps.  You need computer applications and you really need basic spanish to get by.|`|nyylb6qUaa	I would choose Spanish, and Art. You will be able to learn a second language, plus broaden your language and artistic skills in both. Good Luck.|`|nzgZR6onaa	If you plan on going to a good university later on they do like to see a lot of foreign languages but if not the computer courses are also helpful as most good jobs like you to have computer experience so it is all up to your future educational choices.|`|CxCigxZIaa	Choose COMPUTER anything!  Ask what Gateway to Technology is...if it's got anything to do with FUTURE ideas for communication/computers/geeky stuff then by all means do it.  The future will be in computers. So take anything that involves computers.   (even typing class) do they still have that?|`|ClbJXmr6aa	i would do computer applications i did when i was in 8th grade spanish too cause it wont count for high school at least it dosent where i go to school but it will help prepare you|`|jg5yg2ojaa	Do what you want. If you wanted to do spanish than do it. Try to get a feel for spanish like take online research. If not than its okay. But just make sure you do what YOU want to do|`|q28NPPjkaa	Spanish and Computer Apps will both prepare you for highschool.|`|zHRWklEWaa	I would do Spanish as it it REALLY useful. Then I would probably do art or home ec as you already have a computer class.
h1XcYcJ7aa	I'm glad his one year shots are coming soon. You need the help of a pediatrician who you like.     Have you let your baby try eating things with his own hands. Cheerios are a good one to play with. Have you raised him to middle foods? Not the pureed stuff but the food with some texture to it. He can play in some of the baby food as well. Sometimes they are so busy playing they begin to get the idea that eating is a good thing. See how it goes and keep an eye on him. I'd go with playing with what he is used to eating first. Our son used to like to eat what was on the floor. At his dinner time we'd put a big table cloth on the floor and he'd eat part of his dinner there happy as a clam. Then we'd put him in his high chair for the rest of his meal. He's grown now and even has good manners.     Babies do the walking thing in their own time. Some before age one and some after. Is he crawling and pulling himself up? You can always play games with him that help build up those muscles. Hold things just a little bit away from him so that he reaches. If you put a toy just out of reach he will go to some trouble to reach it.     I can understand why you are worried with another child on the way. It is a lot to do and a big responsibility. I hope you will soon be with another doctor who will be helpful for you. It will also give you a second opinion if your child has any problems or is just slower than some others. That is always a mom's worry.     You aren't being a bad mom at all and don't let anyone tell you that. You care about this child and will obviously do anything that he needs to grow well. Don't be afraid to take help when it is offered. You need some time off too. God Bless you both.|`|tQ6BePB3aa	I'm not a mom, but I can help you with your questions.    1.  Some kids are picky.  Actually, most kids are.  Just keep offering him different foods and don't worry if they get rejected.  Eventually, he'll try one and like it.  We always opened three jars of food and expected to refrigerate two.  One day my son, after rejecting peas for months, started eating peas like there was no tomorrow.  Just make it a no drama thing, even though the little one will get fussy when given foods he doesn't like.  Give the little guy a big-handled baby spoon to feed himself and keep the camera (and several moist towels) handy.  At worst, he'll make himself puke.  More likely, he'll smear food all over his face and hair until he learns how to get food from the spoon to his mouth.  Remember, he can't see his target.    2.  At 1, he should be sitting-up on his own.  If a specialist has examined him and determined that he's fine, then there is a pretty good chance that he just likes reclining.  After all, who doesn't?  Even though you're dancing for joy inside, make this another no-drama thing.  If you see him sitting-up, talk to him like you normally would and be encouraging, but not excited.  To give him incentive, put some of his toys at a level that he needs to sit-up to reach.    3.  At 1, he should also be able to stand-up.  However, every child is different.  I did not talk until I was five and I'm plenty chatty now.  Like sitting-up, it's most likely a matter of incentive.  Give him a reason to stand and he'll probably start to make an effort.  However, once he starts walking, running is not far behind....    Finally, I may be wrong, but I don't think your pediatrician is going out of her way to be a *****.  It's more likely that she's just concerned, as he's slow to meet his milestones.  Next time you have to see a specialist, ask when you should start to be concerned about his development and what you can do to help him along.  That way, your trip won't be in vain and you can relay that information to your son's ped.    Good luck!    -J-|`|cAtWxJG1aa	by a year, unless there's a medical issue, he really can handle "people food" like cheerios or toast or cooked vegetables or soft fruit.  you can have him "practice" and warm up to it by using a blender on the adult food but gradually leaving it more and more chunky.  take a first aid/cpr class to lessen your concern about choking, so you'll know what to do if need be.  it used to scare me, too, but humans really are designed to be able to eat, and he can, too, if you give him a chance.     12 months is on the late end for not being able to sit himself up, and somewhat on the late end for not being able to stand, but totally in the realm of normalcy for not being able to walk.  it may be perfectly normal for him, he may need more time practicing (make sure you're not keeping him in a bouncy seat or highchair or exersaucer too often), or he may actually have a developmental delay worth looking into.    i have four kids and they were all on totally different schedules with their milestones ... and you'd never be able to tell now who did what first.    i think your plan to get a pediatrician you trust is a good one.  then you'll be able to set your mind at rest about whether your son is on track for him or whether he might need some interventions.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	every child is different. You will know when he ready for new things... just do everything by his pace. Just try not to get frustrated that can sometimes delay things for children too believe it or not! Just do lots of praising for him when he stands or sits up, that should make him want to do it more!|`|pOwOYqhEaa	All babies are different and do things at different times. If you are really worried then it might be worth it to take him 100 miles away or at the very least change his pediatrition asap. but for the problems you are facing:    1 If he is eating the Gerber foods go up a stage or two on the things he is eating. give him finger foods, diced peaches the little meat sticks gerber makes my boys loved those. mashed potatoes. for allergy reasons stay away from the mixed fruit. also you can get toddler spoons from the dollar store. they are soft and small for his gums and little teeth.    2. try making it into a game. put something just out of his reach so he has to sit up to get it. lie down beside him and show him . He learns and you get some exercise.    3. He wont walk until he is ready. But buy him a walker and put him in it and again put something just out of his reach so he has to walk to get it. he will eventually catch on and then realize the walker is in his way and he will try to walk without it.    Hope some of this helps. GL to you and your little guy.

M6W42Yd6aa	Wow.  I really like Rylan Benjamin!! That's gorgeous!! I love it!!  Umn, let's see... I named my tiny preemie baby Jolie Arielle. I thought it was very elegant.  But yeah, I was trying to stay away from trendy, although this time around, I think I do like Audrey, which is pretty high up on the list. :( I don't know quite how I feel about that yet.  But honestly, you just have to go with what feels right. You'll find the right name eventually. It's not necessarily going to be easy, though! I find it really hard with girls names. Boys are pretty easy, I think. But there's a whole plethora of names for girls.  I'm glad your husband is so enthusiastic about having a baby. That's great. :D My fiance has been very distant since we lost Jolie. But he's warming up a bit now because of the new baby. I think you'll eventually warm up to the idea. :)  But yeah, best girl name is Audrey Kate.  Best boy name is Benjamin Jackson.

7Raehh4daa	To answer your question about teething and diarrhea; Yes!  Teething can cause diarrhea, and it certainly has to my children.  In fact, it's not the diarrhea that gives me a heads up on the teething, I usually notice the diaper rash first.  If he is getting his lateral incisors, that could be causing the problem.  I don't think those symptoms are limited to any particular teeth.  For my children, and many others', the symptoms can start with the central incisors and occur up until they get their 2yr. old molars.  A mild fever may accompany the symptoms you describe.  I would be alarmed if a high fever (anything over 101) occurred with the diarrhea.  Best wishes with your quest to discover what's going on!|`|JdqDauEDaa	He may have a problem with digestion or he may be fighting a stomach bug. Do you feed him juice? How about cow's milk? Read what I found below on infants and diarrhea.    How can I tell if my baby has diarrhea?    First, you'll need to consider what's normal for your particular baby. Newborn babies poop frequently  as often as after every feeding  and their poop is typically pretty soft, especially if breastfed. On top of that, your baby's stool may change depending upon what you've eaten, if he's nursing. Once he starts eating solid foods, you'll find that his stool has firmed up a bit  though it may change from time to time, depending upon his diet.    All of which makes it hard to describe how to tell if your baby has diarrhea. Bottom line: An occasional stool that's looser than normal for your baby is nothing to worry about, but if your baby' bowel movements suddenly change  that is, he poops more than usual and passes looser, more watery stools than usual  then it's probably diarrhea.    While a severe case of diarrhea can alarm even the most unflappable parents, rest assured that in the United States most cases of diarrhea are relatively mild and don't pose a major health threat as long as your baby doesn't get dehydrated. But dehydration can be very serious, even fatal, in a baby, so it's crucial that you make sure your baby is getting plenty of liquids.  What causes diarrhea?    The list of possibilities is long. Your baby's diarrhea could be caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It might also be the result of a parasite, a course of antibiotics, or something he ate.    Viral infection  Any number of viruses  like the rotovirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, and influenza  can cause diarrhea, as well as vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, and achiness.    Bacterial infection  Bacteria  such as salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus, campylobacter, or E. coli  can also be responsible for diarrhea. If your baby has a bacterial infection, he may have severe diarrhea, accompanied by cramps, blood in his stool, and a fever. (He may or may not be vomiting.)    Some bacterial infections clear up on their own, but some, like that from the E. coli that can be found in undercooked meat and other food sources, can be very serious. So if your baby has these symptoms, take him to the doctor. She'll examine him and probably evaluate a stool culture for signs of a bacterial infection.    Ear infection  In some cases, an ear infection (which may be viral or bacterial) can be the culprit in a bout of diarrhea. If this is the case, you may also notice that your baby is fussy and pulling on his ears. He may also be vomiting and have a poor appetite, and he may have recently had a cold.    Parasites  Parasitic infections can also cause diarrhea. Giardiasis, for example, is caused by a microscopic parasite that lives in the bowel. Symptoms may include gas, bloating, diarrhea, and greasy stools. These kinds of infections are easily spread in group-care situations, and treatment involves special medicine, so your baby will need to see the doctor.    Antibiotics  If your baby has diarrhea during or after a course of antibiotics, it may be related to the medicine, which kills off good bacteria in the intestines along with the problem-causing bacteria. Talk to his doctor about alternatives and remedies, but don't stop giving any prescribed medication to your baby until his doctor gives you the go-ahead.    Too much juice  Too much juice (especially fruit juice containing sorbitol and high levels of fructose) or too many sweetened drinks can upset a baby's tummy and cause him to have loose stools. Cutting back the amount should solve the problem in a week or so. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you not give your baby fruit juice before the age of 6 months. After that, give him no more than 4 ounces a day.    Improperly mixed formula can also cause diarrhea, so make sure you're adding the right amount of water when you mix your baby's formula.    Food allergy  ? Call 911 if your baby is having trouble breathing or has swelling of his face or lips.  A food allergy (in which the body's immune system responds to normally harmless food proteins) can cause mild or severe reactions  immediately or within a couple of hours. Symptoms might include diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. In more severe cases, an allergy can also cause hives, a rash, swelling, and breathing difficulty.    Milk protein is the most common food allergen. (Your baby shouldn't drink cow's milk until after his first birthday, but formula made with cow's milk or food made with a dairy product  once he's eating solids  can cause a reaction, if your baby's allergic. In some cases, so can breast milk, if the mother has been eating dairy products.) Other common food allergens (most of which your baby won't yet have on his menu) include eggs, peanuts, soy, wheat, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. If you|`|cmR2RqlOaa	Call your pediatrician. Never be afraid to call your health care provider. No question is trite.   Your child's health is most important.|`|m2aznd8xaa	if he is teething and has alot of drooling than that can be why he got diarrhea  if he doesnt have a fever than he should be okay. if he gets a fever call the dr it can be a sign of the body fighting an infection. he probably isnt eating because his teeth hurt or his gums.for his hiney put desitin cream on it. that is great stuff and provides instant relieve. when  babies have diarrhea give lots of clear fluides .broth, and put him on the brat diet.that is babanas,rice,applesause,and toast.for the next few days or until the diarrhea subsides.and if you give pain medicine you have to  alternate baby tylenol and baby motrin. your not supposed to give the same medicine over and over .check his gums and see if they look red or swollen. also whole grain bagels are great frozen for alleviating some of the gum pain.  i have two kids a 9 yr old and a 20 month old girls and i always do the brat diet when they have diahrrea and it works when vomiting too. i learned of all this from my kids dr so it does work.just keep an eye that he dont get a fever .

FdQD8H3qaa	When my son started to hit he thought that it was funny too...  I made it a point to tell him "NO" sternly and then I would put him down and tell him we don't hit or bite or what ever it was he was doing..  It didn't take him long to connect that when he did that he got put down and didn't get picked back up.  Now he is 20 months old and if he hits we hold his hand and make him look at us in the face and tell him "NO!  We don't hit!" and tell him to say sorry and give us a kiss. It works really well... but if he does that and then turns around and hits he gets put in the corner for a time out  and then I get down to his level and tell him again that we don't hit and to say sorry and give me a kiss..  This have worked really well for us but I really do think that it is all because we started at such a young age and we never acted like the bad behavior was funny!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	When she gets rough say NO firmly and put her in her playpen and walk away for 5 mins. She thinks it is funny because she gets a reaction, but if she gets a baby "time out" and no funny reaction AND she's dumped in the playpen onher own when she was having fun with you(!!) she'll soon get the message.  Smacking her will do no good she is too young...if thats a parenting route you wish to take she at least needs to understand what NO means first .  Good luck and lets hope you keep your teeth lol :)|`|2F5HNPqPaa	11 months is young for time out, but not you probably can make it work if you stick to it... it depends on the child whether they'll understand... some will, some won't until a little older.  Allocate a corner or "naughty chair" specifically for this.  Don't make her sit for over a minute at this age though.      Hitting probably won't help much as she hurts you, you hurt her back... you're really trying to teach her that she's hurting people and that it's wrong!      If time out really isn't an option for her and she isn't old enough to understand/take responsibility for her actions - as the adult it falls to you (joy!).  All you can do is keep her head away from things she can break or injure with it!  Make sure your face isn't in a position it could be head butted and warn others to beware too.  Good luck and hope she grows out of it or gets bored soon!|`|AA10953561	Hon, she isn't too young to have a couple swats on the bottom or to have toys taken away. She is at an age that she is learning right from wrong and it's up to you to reinforce right and wrong. The next time she head butt you, say no, very firmly and tell her that she's hurt you. Then set her down and walk away from her. Then if it happens again repeat the action and don't engage in playing with her in a bodily manner, you can still get down and play dolls or cars with her, but if she starts getting too close to you say "No, you hit mommy and it hurts." After a little while she'll start catching on that it isn't okay to be that rough.     Also, think about where she might be getting these behaviors from. What cartoons does she watch? Who else is she hanging out with that allows this sort of behavior? You should talk to everyone around her (even your younger sisters) and explain what to do when she seems to be getting too rough.    Good luck!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	My son went through that phase.  It was very painful for me.  He would just swing that head back and 9 times out of 10 it was right at my face.  one time i had a fat lip for a couple of days.  He thought it was funny and a game.  I put him down as soon he started swinging that head.  It took probably 2 weeks to completely break that habit.  I would do the same.  Until she gets it through her head, I wouldn't let anyone else hold her who could be taken by surprise - mainly referring to the youngsters.  Every time she does it - No! and put her down.  Tell her its not nice and it hurts mommy.  then do something else.  Keep doing it.  She will get the hint.    Good luck!|`|uNgslkwwaa	Agree with answer above but it's interesting to note that that you say you've seen other kids headbutting - so has your daughter and it's likely that she's just copying behaviour. Second point is that when she does this she will more likely get a lot of attention from you and others. Teaching her that if she headbutts that you'll not give her the attention - by putting her on a naughty step or in her room should work.     Good luck.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Time outs in the corner. When she does this immediately tell her why it's wrong and since she won't listen,she must be in timeout for how ever long you think she should. She may fuss,cry or even throw a tantrum,if she does throw a tantrum,her timeout should go up by five minutes at least.

fC1HUgAAaa	Between 18-22 weeks is the best time to tell the gender.

They can usually see the sex anytime after 18 or so weeks.|`|1UpR1vSCaa	1)FIRST ONE @ 9 weeks 6 day i did not get any pictures  2) @ 21 weeks 3 days found out she was a girl and got tons of pictures   i haven't had a 3rd one i hope i do to see how much shes grown!!!|`|eFB2jLVbaa	you should have an ultrasound  the minute you find out your pregnant since they have to check the baby to see how its developing they will NOT let you wait to week 20 to find out the sex to get your first ultrasound, i had my first at 9 weeks 3 days and then another one at 12 weeks, then finally my 20 week check up which is the one i found out the sex, they usually do about 3 those are the critical ones, but they will do more after that if needed|`|ipnhJsP0aa	I am 7 weeks 6 days and had my first appointment last Friday. I was supposed to get my first one done that day, but my doctor's office was without power due to the ice storm. So, I will get one next month when I go back. Then I will get another around 18-20 weeks when we might be able to find out what he/she is. And they also do one somewhere during the 30-36 weeks area, to see if baby is in the right position.|`|cR1WO8Lzaa	Hello,   I'm only getting one ultrasound with my pregnancy and had it at 19 weeks.  The baby was in a weird position and we weren't able to see his face very well... but after the ultrasound tech bounced my belly around a few times, the baby moved and we could definitely tell it is a boy!    I wish I could have had one earlier (For selfish reasons of wanting just to see everything inside) but it could end up being expensive so I just waited.  Also, I actually signed up to participate in a Short Cervix study and they gave me a free ultrasound at 21 weeks.    Good luck!|`|9hrJfhIIaa	I had a transvaginal ultrasound at 8 weeks - see the yolk sac, hear the heart beat, and see our bean. I'm scheduled for my other ultrasound at 20 weeks - can't wait!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey     i had one at 16 weeks, 18, and 19 weeks due some symptoms    i found out babies sex at 19 weeks & 2 Days.    ultrasounds are completely harmless darling to baby. otherwise doctors would not be doing them. There is no reasearch that shows they are bad for baby.  God Bless x Its A boy !|`|QSodlfMraa	17 weeks.|`|rHufcHwHaa	The doctor will usually take care of this for you.  You can see the sex at 20 weeks, and they usually do an anatomy scan at that time to make sure everything looks okay.    I don't know why you'd only want one ultrasound, that's my favorite part about doctor's visits!    Edit-    It's actually not at all like an x-ray to your baby.  It's perfectly safe.|`|tj6MgJujaa	4 MONTHS GOING ON TO FIVE.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i had 3  one at 8 wekes  one at 12...the lady said she thinks its a boy  and then one at 17 and a half..and thats when i was told it was a boy|`|Grmsgziaaa	I was lucky to get one every visit. Here in Mexico thats how the doctors do it. But I didnt know the sex for sure until 25 weeks, I would wait till then.|`|bzYJBV2Paa	we found out the sex at 18weeks
5DK546BUaa	My Vote: Margaret - preferably with all three syllables pronounced! ('MAHR-g?-rit' and not 'MAHR-grit')    Megan is a sweet, simple name - but I love Margaret! Maisie is cute for a nickname, but wouldn't want it as a full name (might be ok in the middle name slot). Marjorie just does nothing for me... and Greta, Gerta and Rita seem very dated and better as nicknames...|`|Jucak0HLaa	Megan...But I like it spelled Meaghan|`|cErLq7f3aa	Maisie|`|1m9cWAEhaa	i like maisie and megan     isnt peggy a form of margaret too?|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Megan.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I absolutely love Margaret, Greta, Maisie, and Megan.   My vote is for Margaret, the original. I think it's lovely!|`|kBek6QCLaa	Rita    but Maisie's good too|`|wi4XXfCEaa	None, sorry. But I guess my favorite is Margaret.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Rita or Megan. My grandmother's name was Margaret,so it is a bit dated.|`|SVyBjDguaa	Rita or Maisie    =]|`|hOjH3Iipaa	My home town is called Greta so I'm inclined to pick that! Would you pronounce it gretta or greeta though?|`|TffCSzHxaa	I like Margaret. It's classic, elegant, and sophisticated. Plus it has a cute nickname: Maggie!|`|yvYQ85oiaa	Marjorie|`|CxRJwJsraa	I love Margaret.....But, I also really love Greta.  (I also love Marguerite).|`|VTZpfTcaaa	Maisie personally    cant say the others stood out for me|`|99Dvcw29aa	Maisy or Megan|`|7haFaalnaa	I like Maisie, because it is different.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	I am tied between Greta and Megan. I like them both. Greta, undoubtedly will remind people of Hansel and Gretel. A while back I asked if people liked Gretchen and they said it reminded them of Gretel. Oh well.|`|wBpennsMaa	Megan|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Marjorie the best. It sounds French to me and it's very pretty.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I like Megan. I know it's more common but I really like it.|`|XHZtwfuIaa	Margaret and Maisie. But my fave nickname for Margaret is Maggie|`|8HtPRUoFaa	Maisie! So cute, and it's not very common.  It also sounds rather British to me :)    I also like Greta... old-fashioned, but unusual and I think it's coming back into style!  I just read an article in Teen Vogue about an up and coming actress called Greta Bellamacina.  Cute!    I also like Maggie and Meg and Mags as nicknames for Margaret.  Best of luck!|`|HivQdKgwaa	Margaret and Megan|`|nkM6wmv6aa	Maisie definitely. Daisy and Maggie are also forms of Margaret that I love!|`|xeBXjvb5aa	Wow, you always ask real stumpers! Why isn't Maggie on the list? :) I guess I'd say Rita only b/c one of my girlfriends calls me Rita as a unrelated nickname meant to be endearing...? :) I hope! I wonder which name you like the best?|`|cKFqN4tpaa	Megan|`|PNMxbktAaa	I really like Marjorie. I think it's a good combination of old and new. It can sound modern, but it still has a bit of an older name sound to it, lol, if you get what I mean.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	That's a hard one. I don't terribly dislike any of them except Gerta. I actually quite like most of them. I'm trying to single one out. I'm stuck between Margaret, Megan, and Marjorie. I'll go with Megan. =)|`|miFe45quaa	Margaret! I love it =)
n5Sx4WwYaa	i like Maria its very pretty!!!|`|y03gSurwaa	ummmm....... how bout none of them.|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	I like Maria best.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I really like Miriam and Maria.|`|xhVe918waa	Marie.    But why not be unique and try spelling it differently? Or add something to it?    Because honestly, Marie is too plain and overused|`|3YZ8QF7waa	Miriam.............    Though I do like Marie. For a middle name, though.|`|CMq78ueSaa	Maria|`|yvYQ85oiaa	Maria|`|G5B2Dx2Zaa	I like Miriam the best.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Mary. I LOVE Mary. She's so sweet.    I also like Miriam a lot!    I'm not really a fan of Marie, Maria or Marietta.|`|v6nJaXZuaa	I like Miriam, because I love the names Miri and Mira.    Marta is also a fave of mine.    Hope I helped!!|`|cKFqN4tpaa	Maria|`|rdGQMSyjaa	My vote goes to Miriam. It's on my favorites list actually. I don't love it, but I do like it. =)|`|wIGuhAZXaa	Miriam is Hebrew|`|T6d1NOwMaa	Maria|`|SCc6f3Uraa	Maria. Then Mary|`|canYIE1haa	Maria, but Marie comes close!|`|eZPRo7uTaa	Miriam- I personally dislike this name  Mary- I love this name, it is very pretty  Marie- I also love this name. I think of it more as a middle name, but it, too is very pretty.  Maria- Its pretty  Marietta- I'm not a fan of it, not my favorite    Mary is my favorite|`|lxNdA1ioaa	my friends name is miriam. rlly pretty.|`|VGy0iFMAaa	Maria|`|7J9wLeYVaa	Maria|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Maria is the best I think.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Miriam|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I like Maria. Marie is my middle name.|`|5DK546BUaa	Moira - Irish, pronounced: MOI-ra    Out of yours... this is a close one... and again, a lot would depend on what it is paired up with... can two tie?     1 Miriam - because I don't see this name as much...   2 Marie - because this is a classic beauty :)|`|oVkeP1lvaa	i like Maria?  the best|`|XzV4bUeFaa	There all very nice names.  However, from all of them I really like Marietta as it is somewhat unusual.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Maria|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Maria or Miriam. Can't decide!    How about Marita and Mariamne, too?   Mariamne (mah-ree-AM-nee) is probably closest to the original form.|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	Marie|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Mary|`|TYl7kmPeaa	marietta its so different and pretty  and also marie|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I love Mary and Maria. Classics! I vote for Maria.|`|EtCkoHX5aa	Maria|`|GvLFP2b6aa	Marietta|`|gxqawyxUaa	I love Marie as a first name, not a middle name though (filler).
q0JTN9QAaa	I always do mine myself, I have not done mine yet but I e-file and get mine back in a week or if I mail it two weeks as long as you direct deposit.  If you let someone else do them and they find a diduction you missed you will still end up paying them more than what they saved you and your not going to leave anything out that would get you fined or jailed if you use turbo tax.  There are free programs on the IRS website  so you can file for free and it is really hard to mess it up.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	we have a accountant but before we would go through H&R Block we got our taxes back in just a little over a week with them but I did have errors once but they helped us fix them.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	i did mine on turbo tax.  i don't own anything, so it was super easy.  i have my daughter & got earned income credit & got my money direct deposit in less than 2 weeks|`|qayCggxMaa	I use Tax Cut (a different program but like Turbo Tax) and do them myself.  We used H&R Block one year, but I later found a mistake on those taxes, and they were expensive.  It was much cheaper to do it myself.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	I have always done my own. My husband always paid someone. He insisted on continuing to pay until finally year before last I did them, then let him go to Jackson Hewitt. They had the exact thing I did and he ended up with several hundred dollars less because of fees.  This year we e-filed...it is free for almost EVERYone this year....with direct deposit. Filed last Wednesday adn expecting our refund in the bank this Friday.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	I have used them all and I would have to say that the tax act and turbo tax are just as accurate as the CPA that we have used for the last 2 years. I did them on there first without going through the final filling stage and then took them to the CPA and they were really close to the same amount. Not worth the 200.00 that  spent at the CPA. IMO|`|cAtWxJG1aa	me, on turbo tax.    (although "did" isn't entirely accurate.  we always owe at tax time, and file very close to the deadline).|`|G2auAv1Saa	I am an accountant so I do our own. I use turbo tax free version. If this is your first year doing it on your own I would recommend using the turbo tax free (go all the way to the end, just don't submit it) then go to a professional place and have them done completely. When you are done with the professional compare it to what you had figured on your own with turbo tax- if you are confident that what you did is just like the professional then do them yourself after that. I think you will be surprised how easy it is.   They all have about the same turn around period.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I have used the tax programs, I paid H&R Block, I have used a CPA and I have come back to turbo tax.  My experience w/H&R block - idiots who don't know anything.  CPA = too much of money to fill in the blanks - seriously I gave him all our numbers and he charged us $500 to plug in the numbers.  I've been using Turbo Tax for the last 2 years.  Its great and easy.  My husband is self employed so he gets a 1099 not even a W2, plus there are all kinds of schedules that have to be filled out and I love turbo tax.  easy and simple and cheap.  i can't say how much money it has saved us these last 2 years.    Good luck!|`|h6kTWuNVaa	We use an old as the hills CPA who gets us fat money back each year. NO idea how he does it, but we always get way more back than we paid in.   Now our whole family goes to him.   He charges about $75, and our return comes in about 6 weeks (although you can get it quicker if you efile.)|`|oP504BtFaa	We used to have an accountant, but that got expensive, so we're using H&R Block. We aren't finished yet, though. So far it's a pretty good program!|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i used Jackson Hewitt. i paid 200$ and got it the next day. they are really good. we went to liberty taxes first and they wanted to give us 2000$ less then we got. so they are really bad?|`|STGs27mhaa	H&R Block.

Sometimes things like that are gonna happen where you have no control and you just wanna tell them how stupid they are. Yet that may not be the answer.. Only you can really decide for yourself. Maybe its just best to walk away and let them see how stupid they have acted on their own. If they cant do that they are predestined to blame other people for their own faults.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	man, don't we all.... what are you talking about?!|`|iZk9jEBpaa	are you on crack or summin?|`|dVFTWemjaa	umm kay easy two points|`|8jsoK3zdaa	blah
wzXJOSIeaa	A pacifier is a good thing. It teaches a baby to comfort his/herself. Please don't regret it, and you will be able to take it away in due time. Trust me, be glad you have it or you might go crazy from all the crying...lol|`|V8GrFx0jaa	She will have the newborn "sucking reflex" until she is about 4 months old. Until then it is literally something she can't help doing. It is NOT hurting her at this age. Just take it away when she is four months old. I promise you that even if she cries for it, it will only be for a little while. Both my kids cried for 40 minutes the first night, 20 minutes the second night, and that was it.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	you have to ween her off of it... I mean she is only six weeks it should not be that hard...only give it to her half of the time you did the day before or so.|`|tapFZBowaa	You can take it away anytime you like, but I don't think you are saying here, shut up!  I think you are saying, I know you are little and you have this sucking reflex that just makes you feel better, so here you go!  (Don't be so hard on yourself Mom!)|`|JP2h62qiaa	it is natural for her to suck or cry. That is why pacifiers were invented. To comfort baby's.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Take it off now.  The longer you wait, the harder it will be.    EDIT: My sister and I never used pacifiers and never sucked our thumbs.|`|sFTqY3tmaa	A pacifier can be tough but it is good in one respect.  When you do decide to take it away when they are older it is way easier then trying to break the thumb sucking habit.  We have 3 kids and each of them used the pacifier with different intensity.  Overall it is a good thing as sucking is a natural reflex that comforts them.  Do not feel guilty about using it, you seem to be aware of her needs so use it with a moderation that you feel comfortable with.
Kx0XoZpmaa	My cousins name is Joshua Mark! He's 3, and everyone calls him Josh. I love the name Sophia Lauren, it's gorgeous!    (:|`|6zVISNTZaa	Is it just the "Josh" you don't like?

I also don't like Joshua Mark.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	Aiden Mark  Caden Mark  Gavin MArk  Adrian MArk  Elijah MArk|`|lDjolKYPaa	okay i LOVE the girl name and also for girls I like Riley.    for a boy:  Brian Mark  Kyle Mark
99Dvcw29aa	its very unusual, but I kinda like it. i think another good pronunciation would be bell-ee-uh or bee-lee-uh.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	I'd pronounce it BELL-EE-UH by just looking at it. It's a pretty name nonetheless. I'm not sure about Lunette, kind of reminds me of lunatic for some strange reason. Maybe spell it Balia to get the sound you want.|`|AuyBdlcYaa	I like it...It's unusaual but it is a very nice name. Good Job picking out!|`|1m9cWAEhaa	belia reminds me of bertha  lunette reminds me of an alien    so i dont like it :p|`|wi4XXfCEaa	Sorry, but I don't like it. Too made up sounding.|`|kBek6QCLaa	It's really pretty|`|6ZHAzrA0aa	I'd say spell it Balea or Balia....  At first I thought it was Belly-UH.... Not so cute....    ? Taylor|`|34VXCyvVaa	I don't think it flows particularly well -- there's a little too much of the L sound in there.  Lunette is pretty, but I think Belia is likely to be mispronounced.  Since Delia is often pronounced "DEEL-ya," people are also likely to pronounced Belia as "BEEL-ya."  A spelling of Baleah or Beleah might give you the pronunciation you're looking for.|`|ODMCAcPDaa	I love it.  However, looking at your pronunciation, I would spell it Bealia.       My first attempt was said Bee-lee-ah.
NcHsbFXhaa	I love Eva Jane and Daniel Jack|`|xhVe918waa	Katie - wayyyyy wayyy wayyy too overused. it's boring. like, the whole world is named Katie. and if anybody didn't even notice, Katie is just a nickname.    Chloe is just like, an awkward name in my opinion.    Eva.. pretty. Classic. I like this name.    Grace is a pretty name, but somehow overused.    For girls, the names I like the most are Eva and Grace.    For the boys, I love all the names. But my favourite would be Alexander. BUT, Alexander Jack does not flow very well.     Jennifer, does not flow well with any name..  but Jane does. Besides, I like that name.|`|CMq78ueSaa	Jennifer Grace  Jack Daniel|`|pLgQZqW0aa	i think that Eva for girls  and alexander for the boy|`|GCcQPzD6aa	I love the names Eva and Grace! I would go for Eva Grace for a girl personally but if you definitely want Jane or Jennifer I prefer Eva Jane. For a boy I prefer Alexander Jack, never thaught of this name before but like it. Hope you have a happy healthy baby whatever you decide to call it.|`|7J9wLeYVaa	Katie Jane  Nicholas not with jack though   nicholas Alexander|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Chloe for girl, Daniel. I like Jennifer as the middle name best|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I love Chloe! Its not too common and its beautiful!  I Like Daniel because its not to common either.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Grace is my fovorite for the girl, but I don't like Grace Jane or Grace Jennifer. Now I do like Gracie Jane.

Tbh im not crazy about jack, its a nice name but its very common and I dont like common names!, but thats just me!|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Congrats on your new arrival but why do you need to ask what people think ? as at the end of the day its your baby & his/her names shouldnt matter to anyone else but yourself|`|gxqawyxUaa	Chloe Jane and Nicholas Jack.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that those are really cute names I like Chloe Jane, Katie Jane, & Eva Jane.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i like Eva Grace the best.  and Daniel Jack|`|YgggHhwuaa	My son is Nicholas...so I love it! Grace was one of my choices for girls.|`|yvYQ85oiaa	I like Chloe with a K. Khloe.  Jane like Plain Jane? Jennifer? I dont like either but I would go with Jane as middle name so they can call her Janie if she doesnt love it.  I would go with Daniel for boy|`|M6W42Yd6aa	I love Eva Jane.  Very classy and elegant. It's gorgeous.  And for a boy, well, Jack is a very awkward middle name, I think. But I think the best Nicholas Jack.   DO NOT USE DANIEL JACK. I automatically started thinking of Jack Daniel's. lol... Not good.  But congrats on your new baby!  I'm so happy for you!!    Please answer mine. I'd really appreciate it.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	eva jane and Nicholas jack|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love them, especially:    Chloe Jane  Eva Jane (favourite)    Alexander Jack (favourite)  Daniel Jack|`|0tJl0L5Raa	not very original.
agfiNdLraa	Thank you!!! i just got my BFP today! and wrote that im finally pregnant and thank you to all my girls that have been there encouraging me throughout the struggle to get pregnant..... and i got reported and people made me cry I had like 5 guys say they didnt care... i had a guy say my baby will look like a monkey ;( i actually cried people are so cruel!. My hubby has really low sperm count and we had sex everyday and i just got my BFP today!!!!!!!! good luck girl! and thansk for sticking up for us!|`|ACtpwL7maa	I personally like hearing the good news and I do also think it is because some of these women go through their two week waits with each other, through questions about symptoms and stuff, its always cool to compare symptoms and see if they were if fact pregnancy related. My hub and I "do it" every other day all the time, I have no idea for sure when I ovulate...I just let nature takes its course. I'm only on month 2 of ttc. I'm currently late for my period and waiting until my husband comes home from his business trip (Friday evening) to test.|`|jKMH27gKaa	I'm guessing the people who report those questions because (1) they are feeling bitter that they are not pregnant and don't want it shoved in their face -- which is too bad that they are letting their own feelings keep them from feeling happy for someone else (I'm always happy to see when someone has a positive at last and often wonder about what happened with some askers); and (2) because they report anything that doesn't have a question.    The last time I got pregnant (miscarriage unfortunately) I used an OPK and got an early positive with First Response HPK. I tried an OPK recently but it only had like 7 tests and not nearly enough to figure out when I was due. I just figured out that the pains I feel mid-cycle are from ovulation, so before it comes I tried to BD as much as possible...Hope that helps!|`|AAbGMKo5aa	i think they just want to encourage us to not give up on ttc.... that one day it would happen...... personally dont have a problem with it and i think u shoudnt either :-]    and have intercourse every other day...|`|scdOdaTKaa	I love when people post they got their BFP, it gives hope to those of us taht are trying.  Anyway....My husband and I are trying we started trying in October with no luck, well a probably early miscarriage this past month. This month we are charting my bbt and I am starting to use OPK's today is day 8. We are also planning on baby dancing every other day in hopes of not missing my most fertile time.  I think that's the best way to cover your timing, I am merely charting and using the opk's to help konw whem I'm ovulating but to also make sure that I am ovulating. Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|PAjHWRhsaa	Well, I am still TTC  1. And every time I am about ready to give up or go back on birth control I get on here and I read these ladies postings about how they just got their BFP and it just gives me that boost of hope I need. That I may get mine soon and to know that some of these ladies getting them have been trying a lot longer and are facing different problems just lets me know that it is very possible. Some women or people may view it as the person posting is trying to rub it in their face and report it. But to me, they are just so excited, and like me, a lot of the women get on here as a support group kind of. So we share everything! I think you ladies know more about me than my own husband does. Haha. Also, keep having sex every other day. That lets the sperm count get back to normal. Sex every day actually lowers his count because it never fully replenishes. But you are doing good! Good luck and lots of baby dust to you and everyone else!!|`|qN5iVvAFaa	My hubby and i are trying to conceive and we are having intercourse 2 a day... probably too much.... but we really want to conceive...
jpbrNyFZaa	No, no, no. Sweet baby Jesus, no.|`|7BsCJMzRaa	just think about the stigmas with the names, your child may not share the same beliefs as you and your beliefs may not be as accepted by their generation so be careful with the names.  They may suffer a lot of unjust ridicule.|`|8qfo3FvYaa	you guys should pick up a baby book.  No offense but no one wants those name.  They might get teased at school, or they might even have a hard time getting a job when they get older. The world is a cold, cruel place and you never know what might happen if you give your child a weird name.  again, i really don't mean to offend you. I'm just trying to give advice.|`|UA8zGGTsaa	Why don't you name your baby this name:    Iamar Etarde    (its unisex)|`|dPULl5hjaa	not and never my style|`|SxlJDkDXaa	sorry but they are too out there|`|yNxYYHszaa	I don't like any of them.

Athena: Lovely uncommon name with a beautiful meaning and origin, very original.     Veronica: I've never cared for this name, I think of a spoiled child.    Amelie: One of my favorite french names.    Sofie: I think this spelling is Polish but I do prefer the more popular Sophie if forced to use this name.    Lourdes: Sounds most like a surname.    Abigail: Cute and classic.    Eva/Ava: Eva is less common and has more of a strong vibe, Ava is popular but lovely and classic. I really like both.    Camille: Pretty but not really my thing.|`|6YKSS6M6aa	I like Athena, Sofie, Abigial, and Ava|`|V96MlOhhaa	I think Amelie and Athena are really pretty!|`|gvx9Jiteaa	Thanks for a nice love story.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Amelie|`|86oPkfzOaa	I have to say Ava/Eva and Camille and my fav.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	love all of the choices  my favs are:  veronica, amelie, sofie, eva, ava, camille  very beautiful names  but ava is my very favorite name everrrrrr|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I would choose Athena or Camille or Amelie.

It's a beautiful name, and I like Camille and Amelie too, although Amelie might be confused with the already overexposed Emily.  Veronica is nice too.  Abigail and Eva/Ava are way too popular for my taste and I like Sofie, but I prefer it spelled Sophie and I like it better as a nickname for Sophia than a stand-alone name.  I don't like Lourdes.    Athena is my favorite.  It reminds me of the goddess.|`|cKFqN4tpaa	Abigail
ODMCAcPDaa	I'm not a mother yet, but I don't think I would put too much consideration on how the names go together and focus on naming each child individually.      After I picked a name though I would make sure there was nothing tacky going on.  Like, I'd never name all my kids starting with the same letter on purpose.  I'd also make sure there wasn't some sort of obvious connection, like Romeo and Juliet (bad example, but you catch my drift).|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I name my kids the names I like. I don't think it really think it matters if they go together. My son's name is Austin and if we have another boy his name is going to be Caden or Brenden a girl will be Jasmine or Kaylee. as long as the name flows with it's own name is what is important to me|`|dPULl5hjaa	My hubby and I were very careful in picking our children names because our last name is 11 letters long!    End result:  Sarah Ann & Aaron John    We kept on repeating, repeating, repeating, repeating the names until we were totally satisfied and it worked!|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	first if i like the name  then if i like the name Elisabeth and Elijah i wouldnt name both of my kids that because they are two similar, but i wouldnt go crazy over if they sound good or not.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Yes, I wouldn't pick names that are similar, that start with the same letter of have similar sounds, but I wouldn't purposefully choose names just because they sound good together.|`|8cgfTAOeaa	I think it's kinda wierd when people name their kids with the first letter all starting the same. I only think of if i like the name and does it go with the last name.|`|1BZbnqxdaa	I think that simply if you like the name should be your main priority but in the case of them sounding good together it's nice to have that sometimes.  However, names like Erin and Eric just sound weird because they are SO simular.     Don't stress on it.
wKYdIaZVaa	I think a lot of us are unique mamas.. who share similar desires and many times, different thoughts...     As far as parenting... I think Pumpkinsmommy is one cool mama. We're both young and she seems to have a laid back approach (as far as not religiously going by EVERYTHING you read in a baby book).     Daniel's Mommy often shares my same opinion on many questions asked... (also always shared some very useful info)    and well Colton's Mommy... I think its just so cool that both of our little ones were born on the same day..     I have a lot of love for many Mamas on Y!A.... after all.. We all have at least one thing in common... (minus the wanna-be mom trolls!)|`|lGcpXteaaa	I haven't actually met anybody (that i know of) that has the same parenting techniques as me. I have a happy medium parenting style whereas most moms on here are either attachment or old school.   But there are some great moms on here, despite me disagreeing with their methods.

Personality wise, probably not as similar.  But, DYOT, Jillian, Mrs. Ferrari, Aaron's Mommy, Bird Flippin', Mystic, Olivia/Ambizzle, etc are all on the same page as me mostly... A couple of them are also on the same Yahoo Group as me for extended breastfeeding so we "talk" outside of Y!A too.    BTW, whatever happened to McMom?
Gka6vkACaa	No.  He's probably just busy or nervous and thinking something to say.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	he could just be busy.    or maybe he thinks if he answers too soon you might think that he's too obsessive or something like that.|`|AdTnizwOaa	No...he could be really into you and just hiding his feelings by looking like he doesn't care. Or he's just really busy -don't jump to conclusions. If you're into him, keep talking to him..don't be afraid if a guy is into you or not it's the question if you are or not.|`|snsRyuqyaa	People can get easily distracted on the internet.

Man I was lazy :)|`|GUswFG2Raa	to be honest im turning 14 on Saturday and i still cant tie my shoes properly....they always come untied and the thing is , i only wear sneakers with laces. most of the time i end up stuffing the laces in my shoes or asking a friend to tie them. i don't know if its normal or not but hes still young so im sure its not a problem.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	He needs a adult to help him, that has time and understanding.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Do you know what? I couldn't tie mine till I was 12.|`|aV3bFchtaa	No.  The problem is not the shoe thing. He needs help and should be evaluated.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	He should have an OT evaluation.  He may have some delays in fine motor skills.  This is not a judgement, but something which could help him.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Just teach him tie bunny ears. its easy and quick. if i can't explain it look it up online or google. You take one lace and make what looks like a bunny ear (loop), , then the other. Then do the second and lay one over the the other Cross then and tie a bow. you can get illustrations online, a 5 y/o can do it. my young ones did at 5.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Does he have any motor skill problems? Like my nephew is dyspraxic and he still can't do his right. Poor thing tries but he can't. He is 6 though. If that's not the case, he could just be lazy and used to getting his way.|`|AA10210542	Most kids should be able to tie their shoes at age eight. However if he has been in velcro shoes it would be very normal not to be able to tie them very well.   I have always liked the velcor shoes for kids under the age of 5 but , once they hit 5 it's time to learn to tie your shoes.   My daughter is 9 and still likes the velcro shoes because the other ones come untied way to much and she hates to stop playing to tie her shoes. They are getting harder to find as her feet are growing so fast and she is starting to wear ladies shoes.|`|AA11471252	Give him shoes without laces, and stop giving him "temper tantrum" attention.    Simply let him know that tying shoes can be really difficult for some people and that's why they make shoes without them!    He will either get the hint and figure out how to tie his shoes, or will end up wearing slipons for the rest of his life.    After all, what's wrong with penny loafers?|`|cQL31oJaaa	From 2nd grade ------ forever my bff could never tie her shoes after YEARS of me trying to each her!!! I guess it`s normal.|`|Ep0CpwDbaa	Every child is different. This could very well be normal for him. Just let him be. As long as everything else is fine, aside from the shoe-tying thing, your nephew is probably a normal kid.
4R93xF8naa	oh wow  what does she want from you??  i think [well you sound] like a good student/daughter/sister.  hmmm..well you know how mothers get maybe it was this one night, and maybe she was irritated from work or something  you should ask her. i am so serious. ask her: "what else do you want from me"..and then like start crying or somethinh [haha thats optional, i do that and it always works], but yeah you should ask her and then see if she has a reasonable response. =]|`|XJEGTZJqaa	she probabaly just was pist off and took her anger out on u

Ojgqd4xNaa	I think the same with my little girl.  She will be 4 months on the 7th!  She can sit by herself for a few seconds, till she gets excited and follows over, she bare pretty much all her weight on her legs, but she's no where close to rolling over.  I'm not worried, because she is still young, but I def think it has to do with the lack of tummy time! She hates it, and I feel ba making her do it!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	My son rolled over from tummy to back at 3.5 months. He didnt roll over from back to tummy until 7 months. At 4 months my son could push up onto his arms (like a push up), he could roll from tummy to back, smile, laugh, started grabbing things, and... that is all I can think of now. My son is 8.5 months now and has not said dada or mama yet. I am patiently waiting!|`|hrMhhB4Saa	my sn rolled over 1 way at 31/2 and the other at 4 1/2 he didnt say mama til 8 months|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	my first did not roll till after 5 months and said mama at 7 months my second rolled at 2 1/2 months one way and is almost 4 months so no mama yet|`|9PqAOQu1aa	My daughter rolled from tummy to back at 2 months, but has only done it a handful of times since then (she's 6 months now)    She has been sitting unsupported since 4 months.|`|DLDweOcYaa	My baby didn't roll over until she was about 6 months old.  She sat up unaided at 8 and a half months old, crawled at 9 months old & pulled herself up at 9 months old.  She's almost 10 months old.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Amber could roll only one way at 3 months and just figured out how to roll the other way last week and she is 5.5 months now. She hated being on her tummy before she could roll and she learnt how to roll from her back to belly first and now she spends most of her days on her tummy because she is able to get there on her own terms...however it is annoying when they can't roll back because it creates a lot of fussiness when they want to go back the other way    The only other special thing I think she did at 4 months was spin around in circles on the floor...
AA12221392	My step daughter lives with us- she has lived with us since she 4.   Her mother didn't want her daughter to be unhappy, so she let her live here. WE have custody.     She loves her mom very much and goes every weekend, and all hoilday breaks with her mom. We share hoildays themselves, and then in the summer we switch and she lives with her mom, and we get her on weekends.     This has worked for us.     I think a mom can't be selfish , and if the father is a good dad let her be with the other parent.|`|a12cbnR4aa	If she has a father that is as good as you say he is then there isn't really a reason she shouldn't spend time with him. She needs her father as much as she need her mother. How does her father feel about it? You are her mother and you know what is best for her.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Six years old ...that s a little old to make the final decision of where she is going to live. I can see her having a little input, but not the final say.|`|nBGjPwViaa	You already asked this....  She is 6 years old, and should not be allowed  to make this decision!!!!!!!|`|o2GmpkvRaa	There is nothing wrong with the daughter living with the father, but maybe the mother should let the child spend the weekend and holidays with the father so that they still could have their relationship, a mother should come in between a father and child relationship, especially if he wants to be around.|`|AA11404315	Aww children 10 years old,          10 years old explains it all, your baby is thinking for herself and want to experiment with both parents. Dont ever take it as she doesnt love you and NEVER think she would hate you for you not letting her, she may rebel but just remember, "you reap what you sew". Because you and dad live so close is a great oppertunity for her to see the other side, she does need both mom and dad but at the same time, you and your ex have to respect her needs...unless he is "the fun parent". Please do not take it personal if she would like to live with dad ok? you are still mom and she will most likely come back home to you, she will need personal time with you, uno things that dad wouldnt understand. I know as a parent you have givin all to raise a little baby for her to almost make you feel "betrayed" when she would like to live with the other but you cant feel that way, you and her dad need to put your personal issues and feeling aside for her (i know, "but ice you dont know the situation")...yes i do, screw custody fights and all that trash, before you know it she will be 18, then 25, then 30..then will you ask was it worth comming to yahoo answers to get encouragement and do the right thing..you two live so close, its so simple... if you need my help with a schedule that works so you and your ex dont see eachother, email me...ill tell you.   i am a dad and have my son with me now because mom did live right down the street from me and wouldnt let him come to my house for dinner when she was working late (stupid things like that), and he gave up on her, packed his stuff and came to me. I do understand, but his mom didnt give him what he needed, time with both parents...You are not giving her up sweetheart, your just helping her grow...and she would know that in the long run....i hope that helped, your question hit a deep spot with me.                                    Ice|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think at age 6 the child shouldn't be the one making the decision. Older, maybe around 12, then yes they should have a big say in it.

K8OjmMUAaa	Well if it were my child and she wanted multiple piercings in her ears, I wouldn't have a problem with it. It's just earrings, for pete's sake, they're just jewelry, they are harmless and not in any way provocative or inappropriate. And if any of the other mothers said anything to me about it I'd tell them to mind their own darn business!|`|3Psi4kBxaa	What does it matter what others think ?|`|838VJJGvaa	No.  My mom likes my ears.  I have my lobes double pierced and a cartilage and I want a second cartilage and a third lobe.  It's only ears.  I love earrings.|`|x0Ftr35Laa	Who cares what other mothers think? I think that with kids sometimes you have to choose your battles. I mean if you control everything she's going to rebel. Save your energy and effort for something that really matters - like if she wants to starts drinking or something along those lines.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	She may say she doesn't want any more piercings, but with her only being 10 that could change next week. Personally i'd object to my daughter who is also 10 from wearing so many earrings because my daughter plays sports and because well she cant pay for them, and i don't think she can take proper care of them.     You must be ok with it. Because you pay for the piercings and the earrings.|`|prqrQcd1aa	this sounds like some tribe in africa or something. If it is because of culture that they are doing this, who am i to judge, if it is because the kid simply wants it all for attention, then the parents need to get a reality check!
CRVi3YsOaa	Go back to court and request that he get a psychiatric evaluation. Tell the courts of his actions towards you and his temperment. My ex has no visitation with our daughter. He had a history of sexual abuse when he was a minor, that I didn't know about until after the fact. And until everything can be worked out I would try supervised visitation at a third party's house (one of your relatives or his), or even out in public like a park or something. If he treats you like that in private maybe he would be less likely to do so when you are out in public or around other relatives, and if he is like that at a relatives house, you can bring them to court to back up your story.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	He has a right to see his daughter.  If issues such as these exist, the best thing for you to do is to go to court.  They will evaluate the situation and determine what type of visitation needs to take place-sometimes, it might be mandatory that it is supervised (i.e. his mother or someone else be with him throughout the visitation).  Of course, they would look at his medical history and/or have an independent exam done to determine his ability to properly take care of his daughter.  Unless he is a danger to his daughter, or is unable to properly care for her, he will have unencumbered visitation-does he have a history of getting angry with/towards HER?    If a visitation order is already in effect, you need to continue visitation as agreed upon until the changes are put into effect.  YOU can get in trouble for not doing so.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Either call his doctor to see how to handle some of the things he does or call your lawyer to request full custody.  That is a tough situation to be in. :(  Can you meet him in public places or would that be worse?
1279d49c535d896b11b907453f4ed733aa	With an eppy - you feel no pain, just pressure... no matter your size.  The eppy itself being given doesn't even hurt (they will give you a local first).  The local doesn't hurt at all compared to labor pains, believe me.  :-)|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I was induced and I had an epidural didn't feel anything not even contration. Doesn't matter of your size|`|gx4s68s8aa	You shouldn't feel the epidural at all.  You will feel a numbing shot.  That hurts about the same as most other kinds of shots.  But then when they put the actual epidural in you should not feel it what so ever.|`|IllWKAUGaa	If you get an epidural then you are completely numbed....all you feel is pressure....and size doesn't really make that much of a difference as long as the baby can fit through...it's gonna stretch your sh*t out no matter what...|`|VFEjLgvuaa	the bigger the pelvic bone is the easier it is to actually deliver as in pushing the baby out. with an epidural you will only be able to feel the pressure of the babies head when you are ready to push...if that at all. when I had my first epidural I couldnt feel anything at all with the 2nd one I could only feel some slight pressure when it was time to push the baby out. My first two I had naturally and yes it is propably the worst pain you will ever go through. Though, the shorter the labor the easier it is to deal with as the longer you are in pain the weaker you pain tolerance becomes and the more it seems to hurt. Good luck and best wishes|`|c6RGmMGjaa	I had an epidural and I honestly couldn't feel a thing, I ended up having an emergency c-section so in my opinion the epidural totally took away the natural feeling of birth, I wish I hadn't had it.|`|KPmfrevlaa	you are probably stressing and stressing (though i cannot blame you, i was like that with my first), the main thing is stay calm. go into your labour feeling calm and relaxed, and try really hard to remain calm and relaxed throughout. labour, in my opinion, i wouldnt describe it as "terribly painful" but more "tiring and exhausting", you just want the baby out. i had an epidural about halfway thru, as my body was exhausted due to me crying the whole time, which didnt get me anywhere. then we had to wait for it to wear off so i could push, which is the hardest part i think, you are convinced that you "cant do it" (thats what i kept saying), but i did it, and it was the happiest moment in my life seeing my daughter for the first time. im assuming you are about to have your first? stay calm calm calm, lol i cannot stress how important that is. try having your baby in water. im having a boy in about 2mths and im having him in the water, im going to focus all my energy on relaxing, not how bad it hurts.  good luck.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Epidurals are amazing with pain.  You only feel a bit of pressure and that is it; no pain.|`|tj6MgJujaa	No it doesn't hurt after you have the epidural.  that's why you get it so you get numb!  but to be honest, it's more like a 1 or 2 out of 10.  so it is relieving and you don't realize there's any pain except when you push, that's different for every woman.  but ask your doctor.  google the advantages and disadvantages of getting an epidural.  but don't get all scared before the birth. calm down and breath deep breaths because you're breathing for your baby as well. so be calm and try not to think about any pain during contractions.  Good luck!|`|Bo4oGgf8aa	I didn't have an epidural or any pain meds for that matter and labor and delivery was a piece of cake for me. I do know people that get meds and are still in pain, but mostly everyone I know that gets an epi says they feel no pain. It is completely different for everyone though. I don't know anyone else who says it was a breeze like myself. It's just mind over matter.|`|yZWhgvgHaa	I really don't think that size matters... your going to feel a little pinch... then coldness where they put the epi. in no matter how big or small you are.    For me it didn't hurt one bit. The only thing that freaked me out is how much they stressed NOT TO MOVE! It just scared me lol but once they put it in it was nothing. I didn't feel anything during labor once i had my epi. put in... i had a great birthing experience and i enjoyed every bit of it. I will get it this time too....     Everyone's experience with the epidural is different. Some women told me it worked great and others have told me they wish they never got it done.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	i dont know how size will affect it but i do know that i was in extreme pain up until they gave me the epidural. i got it put in at 6 cm and that was after about 5 or 6 hours. i was induced though and that pitocin makes the contractions alot stronger and faster. after the epidural though there was no pain, just a lot of pressure and its exausting trying to push.
QGkBZFqWaa	The old folks home.    Eminem is hot.  I used to be obsessed with him.  But just because you grew up in a trailer doesn't make you a wigger. Just makes you broke.    I see wiggers at the mall, try there.  Spot all the white guys wearing South Pole.    I sat near a wigger once at lunch.  He made me angry.  I threw icecream at him :]|`|zdGpaFlfaa	wiggers are really ugly. you need to dress like a skater boy thats hot|`|Osn1xpu6aa	in the cemetery, due to them shooting each other.  Btw, it's WIGGA.

Check those stores first. If they aren't there, they are avoiding you. Probably because you are a fake.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	"The struggle"??? What struggle are you talking about having felt? If you've felt any kind of struggle whatsoever, you couldn't afford the internet I'm sure, much less a computer to use it on.     You had it rough because you listened to Tupac? That doesn't even make any sense.     And just FYI, Eminem might not be the biggest moron alive, but he's making a world-class effort at looking like he is.     "Wiggers?" Come on. You DO know that "wigger" is a word that people made up to make fun of people like you, right? Calling yourself that to look like a badass is just as bad as Blacks calling themselves the n-word to look like a badass. It's disrespectful to your culture and the one you are trying unsucessfully to emulate. My advice to you is that you've felt any kind of struggle whatsoever, concentrate on getting good grades so that you can go to college and get yourself out of the suburbs that you feel so misunderstood in.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Sitting in front of a convenience store, selling drugs?  Or try the basketball court.|`|nkZdtXXhaa	agreed tofu.  the ghetto.    why would you want to embrace something that's brought you down all your life?    move on from it.  be better than your circumstances and refuse to accept victimhood.    If you call yourself a "wigger", you're being both offensive and stupid.      edit:  growing up in a trailer doesn't give you permission to act like you grew up in a trailer.|`|4DoXomHZaa	IN the drop out umemployment line.    Hanging out by high schools seeling drugs,    In the big baggie clothes store.    If you didn't grow up ghetto, you're not. Anyone who did doesn't want to be that way.|`|Zi6Fr49Laa	Go to one of those centers where people get paid to donate their plasma. Or go to the local Family Services department. Any state agency should do. You could always go to the nearest Golden Corral where all of the fat white women hang out. Why didn't the trailor park work out for ya? That sounds like the most obvious place!|`|b5kw4znQaa	your just a fake little ***** arent you, listening to tupac means you went through a struggle ..grow a set|`|CUD2Vmy3aa	If you think you grew up in the ghetto you didnt. the ghetto is where the jews were kept before they were taking to concentration camps.    you are a fag|`|tMl7GjqTaa	gay bars|`|hGAVJPrSaa	Myspace.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	HAHA!

rHwMf2P4aa	Well there is a chance. Does she normally have consistent cycles? Or are her periods sometimes a little late or early? Did you use a condom or some form of birth control when you had sex? If she doesn't start her period within the next couple of days get a over the counter pregnancy test. But your best bet is to get her to a gynecologist to be sure. Sometimes the over the counter pregnancy tests can give false positives or negatives.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	It's possible. That's the risk you take when you don't use a condom. Go to the pharmacy and buy her a pregnancy test. You may as well get used to buying her things because if the test turns out to be positive - you'll be giving her lots of your money for the next 18 years. Hope it was worth it. :-)|`|CN7klGgbaa	maybe...|`|HZubplhvaa	She could be.  But be patient.  Wait a while longer.  Chances are she'll get her period soon.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	She could be.  She could also be stressed....over or underweight.  The only way to know is to take a test.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	Just because she's 4 days late, doesn't mean she's pregnant but there's only one way to be sure....do a test.|`|953b8d3b5ffbd99d49d2e5485e1d4d2daa	try an over the counter pregnancy test.|`|NDju3p0Raa	could b  could not|`|1TTKHz0haa	Take the test >.|`|UA0UWN1haa	How the hell would we no that?    Get her a pregnency test and stay off answers|`|wtIWal7Waa	You need to give much more information.  Being late is common, especially if her cycle isn't steady. If she is on birth control, it's probably not pregnancy. However, if she has had unprotected sex then yes her chances are higher.|`|aiBzKyjlaa	if you had unprotected sex and she is not on the pill then she might.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	possibly and maybe your mate is the father, who knows|`|2hAuIg5baa	get a pregnancy test and make sure she doesnt worry because stress makes your period late|`|vJP6yTy3aa	did you have sex?  yes, she could be.  stop being a tool and wrap it up.  she needs to take a test.|`|iLeG9v2xaa	yea she was sooooooo goood|`|L2bQifUXaa	If you have sex, she could be pregnant. Duh.|`|LMPF5X4raa	maybe..depends if she has ever been late before. if she's never been that late..then maybe. Good Luck!|`|QPyFTOhYaa	its a possibility tell her to go to the docs or take a pregnancy test|`|AA11766296	either tell her to take a hpt or ask your mom|`|fspebSraaa	are you trying for a baby? if you have sex without the pill or a condom she could be. you could try one of those early detection pregnancy tests. and ps the pull out method does not work!|`|xFAzk9j8aa	It varies like if you just took her virginity then she could skip it because it will help to regulate it more often so it occurs right when it should but if its not the first time for her and you didn't use protection or it broke then it is a possibility that she is.|`|zoyw8CRKaa	Get her to do a test.|`|GnKb4cFEaa	take a test ive been a week late but then came on don't stress too much as that wont help either|`|8uiH6iRbaa	she could be !!!!    get a test and find out   a test should give you an accurate answer by now     and if pregnancy is something you don't want then next time wrap it up    if its something you did want CONGRATS|`|z0XRuVwSaa	do we look like a mystic 8 ball? go and buy a pregnancy test and use it . next time use a condom..
2uFNT16aaa	You shouldn't worry to much about the situation.  This is very normal to babies.  There really isn't much you can do.  One thing that works is exercising your baby before she goes to bed at her scheduled time.  If you exercise her then she will get very tired and go to sleep.  Sometimes babies cry because they are sick or the Temperature of your heat or air conditioning in your house is too hot or too cold.  If not get her a couple of new toys!      Maybe your baby hasn't been sleeping well in her cot because she's been having nightmares.  Or maybe she has out grown her cot and needs more room when she is sleeping.      I suggest you take a day to wash her things in the washing machine.   Maybe get her a bigger cot or a toddler bed?  If you seem to be struggling with your baby consult a physician.  Good Luck! (:
rHufcHwHaa	I have heard of this being done before, and I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  I had a friend in high school who was named after her mother but went by her middle name.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I agree w/you.  I don't, however, think anyone would have known how to ;pronounce Cerys w/o you telling us.

DSeG6nFcaa	8:30 pm|`|bgNB9RzNaa	wrong section 9:00pm
dzyJw0cvaa	lol, I have never walked in my parents.  I have four siblings and then theres me so i swear my parents only had sex five times.      As for me being walked in on?? Yes...by my kids AND my parents AND my siblings.  (I was married and lived with my parents for three years *shudder*)  My daughter once said when she walked in on me and my husband, "Daddy was just bumping on you and it freaked me out!' she was three at the time.      And as for having sex with other peoples kids over, if its discreet i dont see why not!  I have sex ALL THE TIME with my kids in the house and they never know.  (now that they are older!)  Hell, i have sex when MY friends sleep over from out of town.  They never know either, though such discreet sex isnt as fun.  But it feels risky! :)|`|a12cbnR4aa	Can you imagine the look on your kid's face if they were to walk in on you. Go hide somewhere else in the house where they can't find you if they need you. You will only be gone for a little while. Besides, that will make it a little kinky and spontaneous. ha ha.|`|5D0KuT74aa	yes  i have sex with the kids too  nothing wrong with some statutary rape, and incest, and lots of other perverted and illeagal stuff  nothing wrong at all|`|FP8Avd3oaa	I'm sorry I competely miss read the question. You are asking do parents have sex while their kids have friends over. I thought you where asking if people have sex with their kids friend and that was just completely wrong. The answer to all is I have not kids and have never walked in on my parents!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Wtf is wrong with you|`|YIbELNRBaa	I don't know, i think that would kind of be embarrassing for the parents and probably a NIGHTMARE for the kid.|`|7fx1Qjpbaa	Of course You have to please your partner whenever where ever.. .That's the Key to a successful marriage...Lock the door and get busy.|`|yxAM9b8Zaa	no but the kids do      All. Night. Long.|`|o2GmpkvRaa	You can still have sex. Just don't make noise. Make sure the door is lock and when you are finish unlock the door. Tell the kids to knock before entering that way it saves everyone from getting embarrass.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	No, its too risky for someone to get sick or upset during the middle of the night and need us, especially not our kids.  No my kids have never walked in on us. Thank goodness.|`|0Cpqulbraa	yeah, me and my wife just wait until a little later and lock the door.|`|m3iPgBWFaa	WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS SOOOO DISTURBING..... WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU???????????|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No. I'd be too afraid they would hear. And anyway. If you must,just lock the door and turn on the TV when they go to sleep...|`|K5AeQuSNaa	You wait until they are asleep, and you remember to lock the door.  Try not to do that Tarzan yell either.  That really wakes the little buggers up...|`|cNVTtkgmaa	I don't have kids and yes I did walk in on my parents when I was a teenager. We never talked about it.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I have sex when my kids are in the house, ( I have no choice obviously).But I would not ever consider having sex with my childs friend in the house.|`|zH4s97yVaa	My uncle and aunt do all the time. I have walked in on them quite a bit.|`|Jl9QAVAYaa	i think its best to wait until the kids are sound asleep.. and plz def not while they are having a sleepover if somebody walks in that can ruin the whole party and not to mention nobody will ever forget.. the kids parents will kno... its just a bad list of consequences that gets longer|`|aiBzKyjlaa	Im not a parent, but I wouldn't. Especially if they had friends over, unless you live in a super mansion and you like miles away and there is a nanny caring for the kids then no.|`|I2gat01haa	uh to think that my parents would do that is gross.  especially if my friends are over.
ef5765ccb36f7ad11f5b37081f153824aa	You're about right on schedule. Women your age usually start getting "the itch" right around now. My wife is getting baby fever bad. But we just both know that right now, we're not ready for it. She still brings it up once in a while, but I have to remind her that we hardly get by on our paychecks right now as it is. I have to bring her back to reality that babies aren't just a fun little toy to play with. They're a lifetime decision, that grow up to be teenagers. They're not always going to be that cute, cuddly little rugrat. Now, of course, you know that, but really think about it and make sure you're ready for that. I think one of the best things for me and wife's marriage has been just enjoying each others company for now. You only get to be young and free one time. Once you have a kid, your life is gonna speed up at a rate you won't believe and you'll find yourself wondering where the time went and not believing that you're at their high school graduation.    All in all, you're still old enough to make this decision consciously and do it responsibly. However, if I could make a suggestion (if you haven't already done this): get a small dog that lives inside the house. It'll teach you a lot about paying constant attention to a small living being and learning how to take care of something very personally. It's not exactly the same, but it'll teach you a lot, as well as fill a LITTLE bit of that void......for now.|`|JMPB5OO0aa	I had my son at 25 and he is now 2 years old.  If I were to go back in time I would still decide to have him.  Honestly, no one can ever prepare you or know if you are ready for the challenge better than you.  The financial responsibility is really the only thing you can figure out before having a baby and know if it's going to work or not.  There are just too many variables to know if you can handle it or not.     I hear people say "so-and-so is going to be the best parent" and they end up being horrible parents and I hear people say "so-and-so should not be having a kid. they are not ready!"  and they end up fitting the role perfectly.    Just make sure you have enough money to support everyone in the house and go with your gut.|`|yGMoKHBlaa	cool asome|`|dwLqreuvaa	While this is true, yess a baby does change everything. You will have to give up numerous things. You will ahve a huge responsibility and i think you should accomplish some career goals first, you probably should first settle down, after you get married and everthing.    Maybe you should get some advice from parents also    Goodluck |`|ElLSCJpwaa	First of all congratulations!    It happens to lots of mothers, my auntie told me a story about my mum a few weeks before she got married, she said she threatened to leave my dad if she didnt get her a baby, she said my mum was kind of joking, but giving the hint that she wants a baby fast, now im not saying if you have one, ull be upset, now if u do have one and u feel like u regret it slightly, this is normal every mother feels tht way, but i think u should wait maybe a year or two, until your 100% sure and absoloutely possitiv and no doubts whatso ever, good luck!|`|wddRvqZfaa	You probably shouldn't have a bay. The world is already overpopulated as is and you would be better off adopting a child in need of your care. Plus, you'll get to remain pure the rest of your life!|`|iufAPDeWaa	I say wait awhile before you have a baby. You want time to get used to married life and to enjoy life just with you two. Go and come when you want. Have quiet, uninterrupted time alone, romantic vacations without children needing your attention the entire time. Not having to worry about a babysitter or anything. Thats very important. Because once the baby comes its no longer just about you two. And the baby will get the majority of your attention for the next 18 years. Don't be in to big of a rush for anything. always take your time. Good Luck and congratulations|`|kwMA5I1iaa	Yes, it is normal. Women get "baby fever" at different times in their life. Unfortunately for me, I found myself wanting and thinking about wanting a baby over a year ago. I'm 21 now and know I need to wait a little longer. Although I have always known I wanted children rather young and nothing would make me happier then being a mother.|`|dcd11iUwaa	me to hon,  its very normal ,especially with women like us in our mid 20's.  I wish you all the best!|`|qlgvecs9aa	Do you live together???  If you do not I will recommend you to wait at least 1 year after you get married.  Even if you have been together for 8 years, trust me things change when you get married.  I had my son 6 months after I got married and I have to tell you I hardly have time to brush my hair !!!!
KICQQxLxaa	*run a super hot shower and sit in the bathroom with her.  The steam will help with the congestion, coughing, etc. You can put some eucalyptus oil or even a bit of vapor rub in the shower while it is running.  * put a humidifier in her room  * elevate the head of her bed a bit  * keep breastfeeding as much as she will take, it will help!    ETA:  I have heard of this by many breastfeeding woman...use a bit of expressed breastmilk in her nose to help clear it up (instead of saline drops)  Mystic answered this question previously, and linked some websites.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|tapFZBowaa	I would try Johnson's vapor bath, that has helped my little one.  A nice warm bath with that soap really helped.  We have also used Little Noses saline drops to help open his airway and I think that helps, we did it at every diaper change.  You can give tylenol if you think it will make her more comfortable if she seems achy, just check with your doc on doses.  Lots of cuddles and that is about all I know to do.....hang in there, this too shall pass!|`|2VtFVKCDaa	Hey, has she been tested for RSV? Its going around like crazy! My 11 month old nephew had it and gave it to his 1 month old brother and the 1 month old ended up in the hospital for 3 days last week.
obN6p3Cgaa	No only your doc can untied it for you.So speak with him.|`|7AYnWg3paa	thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard...dont u think if that was the case there would be a pill to also TIE them...WOW
mBQQL0kCaa	awwwww you almost made me cry, i am sooo sorry,but what i would suggest is to talk to someone like your school counceler and set up a meeting and let your mom know how you feel and if she's any type of loving mother she would understand and apologize and change her ways,im so sorry this happened to you,my mom goes through the same thing with my grand mother.      do you have a good brother?  try getting things through him  i know it shouldnt have to be this way but give it a try|`|SWS8QWvhaa	omg  im soo sorry to here that  i can relate to ur problem in more ways then 1.   for instince my parents give my older brother EVERYTHING too he has wii, ps3, psp anything u name it! and all i have is a yr 2000 karaoke machine thats now broken becuz my brother wanted to borrow it [[and he brok it!]] i honestly dont know how to answer ur question BUT i can say tht u shuld tlk to some1 in skewll like a guidence concerller perhaps =))  i really do hope things get betta wit u and ur family and if not i suggest u move out with an aunt or somethin|`|h0HycfRnaa	i know how you feel, i do exactly the same my brother gets everything i get blamedfor everything, but if you tell them that they make you feel like this this may help, if not tell someone else who you trust and will be able to tell your parents and family how they are making you feel, if it gets worse tell someone of higher authority who may be able to sort it out|`|pVUhlg4iaa	sounds like ur mom is having some other things going on in her life u may not be aware of    i wudnt take it personally, something is obviously bothering her but i doubt its you i mean ur her kid, a simple question is not gonna make someone want to cuss u out.    stick it out hun, sometimes families are simply too dysfunctional to handle...    take a deep breath when u feel unloved, remember that parents have UNCONDITIONAL love, but they are humans too, and go thru rough patches when all they wanna do is slap someone upside the head, even if that means their own kids...    hope things get better, or at least dont get worse!|`|n6NJ1e2daa	Wow. I really feel bad for you. When I was reading your question, my iPod was on shuffle and just happened to be playing "Adagio for Strings". It kind of made your question hit home. Well, I suppose you could just try to talk to her. Sounds like that wouldn't do much, though. I don't know if it's the same as a counselor, but you could talk to a teacher that you trust. I know some teachers that I have talked to when I am feeling sad or stressed. You know, you always have that one really nice, thoughtful teacher that you really like (mine is my English teacher from first semester). Is there anybody in your family that you are close to and could talk to this about? I'm sorry about your situation and I wish I could give you more helpful suggestions, but I have never been in a situation like that. I hope I was at least remotely helpful!|`|qif1TQtnaa	punch her in the face! you don't seem loved.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	I feel bad for you.  But thinking of this logically there's nothing much you can do.  Maybe move in with another relative? Just wait until you're eighteen, you can move out.    Maybe talk with her, calmly, and maturely.|`|xejwm2yVaa	IM me i went through the same thing, id luv 2 chat to you.  dnt wrry im 16 im nt like a councilor or anything like that|`|8TW00N9Daa	Well, if she hits you, report her to the Police.    She has been abusive to you, you need to get out of there.  Not sure how old you are but their are programs to help you.|`|AA10064810	It's sad to say, but you may never be able to talk with your mother in a calm fashion.  My advice is to get some sort of job - your school work and extracurricular comes first - and save for what you want.  Think about how you approach her.  Is your voice whiny?  Are you constantly asking questions, especially about whether she loves you?  If so, stop the questions and check your tone of voice.    The only person you can change is yourself.  Keep staying in your room.  Do talk with a school counselor.  If your mom hits you to hurt you, you might be able to be removed from the house.      I wish this sort of thing didn't happen but it is too common.  If you can survive this, you will be much stronger than your brother and will be able to take care of yourself and any family you might make.    Get the best education you can, even after high school.  This will give you more choices about where you want to live and how much contact you want with your family.  Some families are best left behind.    My mom expressed the wish she had never had kids but she included all 4 of us in the mix, so it wasn't as if she hated any of us.  I never noticed any favoritism but I was the oldest and out of the house at 18 for marriage and college.  She suffered from depression and got some help after all the kids were out of the house.  Who knows what your mom is going through and what medical/mental health problems she has.  Of course, she shouldn't take it out on you, but since you recognize this is happening, you can protect yourself.    Don't be like some of the people I know - go to parents like yours for loans because they can't hold a decent job or handle their money, go over when you know they will bad mouth you, keep looking for acceptance if they can't give any.  You are not at fault and are not unlovable.  They are just not capable of loving.  It is not healthy or loving to give one child everything he asks for.  All it does is produce a weak, dependent adult.   You will probably be the one who is successful.  Even if they never acknowledge this, you will be healthy yourself.
Zu7GJeU4aa	Try this "I am pregnant"|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	Just tell him. Sit him down and tell him. You both have talked about it so you don't have to worry about what will happen. I think the longer you wait the harder it will get.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	well I mean if your relationship is as stron and good as the way you say it is then it should be pretty easy to tell him! He definitely deserves to know, so you should just relax and tell him.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Im pregnant|`|6Zf8K3PAaa	wow i really feel bad for you, but i believe if you just tell him then he will handle it fine..since he pretty much has already told you that..but please tell him soon don't wait very long because he may be angry when you finally tell him and your like 3 months pregnant..good luck with the boyfriend, parents and especially that baby. xx|`|na9nG47zaa	Ya. just tell him straight up. Dont sugarcoat anything, just tell him you're pregnant and see what happens from there. I think that's very strong of you to want to keep the baby, but just know that adoption is always an option. I know it's hard to see your child go, but adoption is a great way to know your baby is safe, if your boyfriend doesn't pull through for you. You'll also have to consider going to college and everything. I don't know if your boyfriend is planning to go to college, but keep in mind if he is, and y'all are married, that could be a big strain on your relationship. I'm sorry for your situation and I hope everything works out alright for you :)|`|6xHOa3tJaa	sit him down and say baby I am pregnant and don't be be nervous ok he will be very happy take care|`|a19Z5rwLaa	"I am pregnant"   and then watch him cry as he thinks about wasting his youth.|`|tktpraYVaa	just tell him how you feel is best  its not like your going to live with our answers  helping you your whole life|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Go up to him, open your mouth, and say this:  "I am pregnant."    Ta da!|`|511f36b32bab3f108f576850ec28ee32aa	Well when you two are together confront him casually yet seriously about it.|`|kuO4oypZaa	Make him a cake with "I'm pregnant" in icing.  Everyone's happy to get a cake.|`|93ef28cefacaf49d52606517946a2d08aa	The words, "I TOLD YOU SO COME" come to mind!  (oops I wasn't supposed to call you out, sorry)      DISASTER!!!!!!!!!!!      Just tell him, there's no good or bad right or wrong way, ya just do it and keep on trucking!    WELCOME TO HARDSHIP!|`|9TvkpDVxaa	first, you are a dumb ***** and you dont know how badly you ****** up your life, so get an abortion, or put your baby up for adoption, one thing that will definetly happen is your boyfriend dipping cuz he doesnt want to take care of no damn baby|`|nSBCZqJCaa	wow.. that is a really tough question, but all you have to do is just tell him. I think your right about telling him first and then your parents... if he really loves you then he'll support you right?|`|Eg0WqKmBaa	There isnt really any easy way to break it to the guy. so just take him somewhere private and tell him that you have something to tell him and tell away.    hopefully he will follow through with what he said before.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Well just tell him upfront...WHen you guys are hanging together, just casually tell him that you are pregnant. GOod luck|`|93fXLKkCaa	i would tell him like in text or somthin so its not as nervous|`|4IYKRhxIaa	like this: "hey by the way. baby. i love you sweetie. um so yeah. oh baby. k. yeah. im kinda... sorta... well... baby i love ya... ok fine ill just tell you. im pregnant."  then give him a big, fat, wet, smooch and run away. =D|`|pluEas6maa	Well I'd be more concerned on how to tell my parents. Just let him know. Being 17 or 18, I bet his words will change into him dumping you. Just saying from family experiences NOT BEING MEAN!|`|T1z1SGe3aa	honestly i see no problem in your case.he wants to marry you if you get a baby.how nice!  good luck!  tell your parents|`|7AxLSwrPaa	Just take a deep breath before you give him the news. Come straight out with it, and say exactly what you think needs to be said. Odds are, if this boy cares about you enough to say the things he said about marrying you and helping you out, he's going to. You shouldn't be so nervous, just try to relax and speak from the heart. It's a hard situation that you've been put in, but I promise things always work out in the end. The sooner you just get it out and get it over the with, the sooner you two can go on to figure out what you're going to do about it.  :)|`|Wu5q79tgaa	why did you call your baby a 'IT'?? but do exactly what you said you would do !!! just bring up the things he said he would do and just come right out and say that you are pregnant ..but as far as you parents that's going to have to be done by yourself ...because i really don't know what your parents are like ...like if you can talk to them about everything or if they are hard to talk about things to     just relax and keep your ears open|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Unfortunately, young loves do not usually last, especially with a baby.  However, he deserves to know the truth.  Just meet him in a private place, maybe at home, and tell him the truth.  You two need to express your feelings on the situation, and make a plan for the future.  Make sure, though, you tell your parents.  They may be upset, but they want the best for you.  All of you need to talk out your future and the baby's future (ex. money, health, education, etc.).|`|rxx9ub7haa	Be honest with him but be subtle because it is big news already so it doesn't need to be blown out of proportion. If you truly trust him just be open about it and you'll be fine.  ps- glad you're not considering abortion|`|MdSU0s8Saa	start with a nice night, good food favourite film etc. make sure he's in a lovely mood, remind him of when you two had sex and then tell him your pregnant  good luck with telling him and with the baby! =]|`|U8R2o1P3aa	Oh, sticky situation.   First off I really really respect the way you are taking responsibility for your actions. And i also am very happy for you that you are not having an abortion. I respect that.  Second, just sit him down, tell him you love him, and bring up last time you had sex. After you bring it up, tell him.  It will be okay, don't worry. Stay strong.  Good Luck!!|`|hTl4t7WOaa	The best thing you can do is just sit down with him and tell him, but also prepare yourself for the fact he may NOT be there.  I know you said you two have a great relationship but alot of guys will tell a girl what they want to hear and not follow through.  I got pregnant at 16 and was luck enough to marry the father and 12 years later we still have a great relationship so you may very well have a good man but don't forgot you two will have a long road ahead of you starting out so young you are going to miss out on alot of things because of it both socially and as a couple.  Just be prepared to tell him by sitting down and telling him the truth and your intentions for the pregnancy.  Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.      And then tell your parents together, while your parents may be upset with you not because they dont love you but because they are worried for you it will show them your maturity to sit down as a couple and discuss your intentions with them as well.   Good luck to you I hope it all works out for the best!|`|6zVISNTZaa	It'll seem hard, but you have to tell him. Sit him down and tell him that you're pregnant and you need to know his opinion. Don't be too surprised if in shock he runs away or has a bad reaction, this is the case sometimes. How did you fall pregnant? Were you on contraception?|`|Ht17bpMYaa	just tell him look i have to talk to u............i am pregnant and ask him how does he feel about becoming a dad or does he wants to have the baby..|`|A8kFFduNaa	Oooh boy i would be so pissed off i a girl told me this|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Just sit him down.  Remind him of whenever you last had sex.  "...yeah...I'm pregnant."|`|9gsm05lnaa	Just tell him. Make sure that he sitting down first! Whats done is done and so now comes the planning!!!|`|67EaIAvbaa	you go night night|`|pVUhlg4iaa	hey dick wad im knocked up     and ur the father    dun dun dun!!|`|iw0slAK9aa	uhhh... just tell him.. the end   DO NOT ABORT|`|YWlSB3esaa	if ur boyfriend is rich then i dont see a reason why u shouldnt tell him|`|8xXPnKsQaa	you should text him while your sitting right next to him, so then y'all can talk about it.|`|tNSkgDMzaa	say "guess what im pregnant" and if he dumps you screw him you will find better|`|MDpZFQTJaa	Do You Realize? - why would YOU be pissed off? You're the one that got her knocked up. :P    Just tell him. There's no easy way to do it.   Good luck.|`|TR2EDuLWaa	just come out and say like I love you and I know you love me and now we can both love the baby we will be bringing into the world. Or just come right out and say it.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	I would just tell him your are pregnant    IN EBONICS, of course    LOL - I am hurting myself|`|Px79AEXtaa	Easy.  This is grow up time for you.  You need to worry about the baby first, you second and your husband to be is third.  Go see him and tell him in person.  You should both tell your parents and his parents too.  You need to go see a doctor and start prenatal care.  Good luck.|`|6uJeUbRkaa	Well if he was me (im 18 going on 19) no matter how you told me, i would flip so just probably tell him in person some how. That would be the best way, and don't wait too long.|`|H57vwVT2aa	Thats a sticky situation but you have to make the best of what it is. It sounds like hes very supportive so i would just be like hey i need to talk to you about something really imporant and just come out and tell him. He might be alittle suprised at first but its not like hes going to be mad at you. You both made this life so from what he has told you in the past you should be comfortable talking to him about it. Good luck with ur parents though.|`|MhvwRwNKaa	show him the pregnancy test.. thats what I did|`|cBW9sSjIaa	He's going to be freaked out wether he shows he is or not. If your really against abortion then you just have to get him some place private, away from people, and say something along the lines of "I'm having a baby." And you might want to make sure he realizes its his. Good Luck to both of you:)|`|muL5Xi3gaa	I think you already know what to do. Just ask him over, let him know it's about something serious, and go somewhere very private. Tell him the news and make sure he knows if he needs the time to come to terms you will be there for him. Now make plans. Are you ready for marriage? Are you ready for this baby? What are your options? What will you two do about school? Jobs? How to tell the parents?   Good luck, and I'm glad to hear you are ready to take the responsibility of your actions.|`|E3ue1nWAaa	Well, at least you know it's a mistake.  The miracle of life should wait until you're out of college, in my opinion.  I'm glad both you and your boyfriend do not want you to get an abortion.  That's a great choice.  I think you should just say to him "Honey, you're going to be a daddy." That's probably the easiest way to say it. Congratulations and good luck telling your parents. I hope you was able to help you in some way.|`|p0WEjAwdaa	just tell him you need to talk, make sure you can talk in private.  tell him tell him your preagnant and want to know what he would liek to do. would he like a termination? does he still want to marry you?    then take it from there    since hes such a supportive boyfriend, im sure it will be apsilutaly fine  and you should just tell him,  dont worry  :)|`|Zyfm8vnnaa	just be like " you know that thing we did ?? well i kindaa got results backkk. and when you tell your parents dont forget to tell them your scared so they will feel a little bad for you. hope that helpes ( :|`|rCc5uBDTaa	well.  just start him off by being like.  "you love me more than anything right?  and you wanna spend your life with me right?  well i haven't had my period and...i'm pregnant."  or just something.  i wish i could help :/  but i wish you the best|`|xejwm2yVaa	tell him the classic "i have something to tell you" deal and take him out to dinner  Dinner and a Present.Wrap up your positive pregnancy test like a little present and present it to him over his favorite meal take him to his favorite restaurant and have the maitre'd bring the gift to the table after you've finished dinner.|`|tpub3QNaaa	first start out by telling him that you need to talk to him.  you really dont have to be worried, if he has said all of that!  just start saying something that has to do with that a little bit...  definately tell him before your parents, he will be major support  for that! GOOD LUCK!!! :D|`|snsRyuqyaa	Remind him about what he said first and then just say I think I could be pregnant, ask him to get you a test then you can show him the positive test if you are. Good Luck|`|b8Tl2c9zaa	well, i think its great that you have such a supportive boyfriend, and if anything you should definitely tell him first so he can be there when your parents find out.Other than that, all i can say is that you should get checked by an obgyn, they do tests to make sure that everything is safe, and give you medication so there won't be a miscarrage.   and with that being said, good luck with everything, and hope all goes well! =)|`|AA10064810	My only concern about your telling him is that I personally know of couples that, when the guy was told, suddenly decided that the girl was sleeping around and washed his hands of her and of the baby.    You are awfully young to have a baby and raise it.  You would need much help from your parents because it is essential you finish high school.  That diploma will enable you to support your child and yourself and your husband, if you decide to marry.    I could go on, but here is what I recommend:  Start a conversation about your futures together and then tell him that you both are pregnant.  Give him time to react.  He may be jubilant and may be horrified.  Either is normal and being upset does not mean he doesn't want the baby.  He will be as terrified as you are.    Then, get both families together or both of you go to each of them.  Again, give everyone time to get used to the idea.       If there is anyone who doubts the baby is his, insist on a DNA report at birth and get it established then because you do not want this baby denied contact with all its relatives.    No matter what you decide, keeping the baby or adoption, you have to take care of your and the baby's health by getting pre-natal care ASAP.    Please finish school.  Good luck with this.|`|RrmO1xkuaa	You aren't too young or stupid, on the contrary - you and your bf both seems to be very responsible for wanting to raise the baby. I know it must be tough at your age, but having a supportive bf who is also graduating soon (or has graduated) helps a lot. Since you've already talked about possible pregnancy and it's consequences, telling him you're pregnant won't be that hard. I think it'd be better if you tell him first, discuss your options and make some general plans (to make sure you're both on the same page) and then both of you tell yours and his parents. Just don't stress out too much, and remember: your bf and your parents will be there for you...Good Luck and Congrats!|`|HOdblqIkaa	Don't hold him to those promises, people say one thing when its just an idea but another when its reality. If he does stick to his word then your pretty set. Just tell him, its easier to tell him than your parents. You could always take a test in front of him so he knows or take him to a planned parenthood or other similar clinic to get a test. You already know so the test for you won't be anthing new, but it'll make it more real for him to accept.|`|SWxBuzntaa	Just come right out and say it or just kinda cozy up to him and say," do you remember when we were talking about what would happen if I got pregnant? well if it were really going to happen would you keep to your word cause I am pregnant..." this is probably going to come to him as a shock though just let it sink in for a bit I am sure he will get it|`|381bc01ff9a0d000383e935fd5d4d532aa	you sound like ur handling this well. congratulations. just tell him calmly and find a way to tell ur parents cus u r gonna need their support. Good luck!|`|8bPmTLT0aa	Just come out and tell him, I got pregnant at 16 with my son I just gave my boyfriend the paper that said my pregnancy test was posi.     Good luck, make sure to start stocking up on wipes and diapers of all sizes they are expensive...|`|hwEQH1tpaa	When he gets home from work/school or whatever bring him to the bathroom and show him the tests and and say "Honey, I'm pregnant" and wait for him to give you a hug. :))|`|TJTRaRz6aa	just tell him he needs to know.|`|V03f8tmMaa	Just call and tell him i need to tell you something really important then you say im coming over to your house and ill tell u there i think thats the best way|`|lRNAlYyXaa	Well you ironically sound fairly prepared for this event so just sit him down and tell him. The sooner the better. That's all there is to it just tell him.|`|tgh0yJp4aa	you are too young and too stupid. honestly, why not wait? if he truly loved you, he should have respected you and your body.|`|irAlfTveaa	He sounds like a really nice guy from what you said so i would just tell him that you have to tell him something important and sit down together and talk about it. I wouldn't like play and games or anything or beat around the bus about it.|`|AA11433347	tell him that its important and could change your lives tell him then go get an abortion if he wants you to you ARE way to young just saying they cost about 18000 a year|`|oJPoaJTtaa	THIS IS A JOB FOR......DR.PHIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8AzkADlCaa	I think he would appreciate it if you just came out and told him, give him some time to accept it and this will be a test if he loves you enough. Good luck :)|`|FxlA9obIaa	Awww honey!  Just come out with it.  Be straight up and honest.  Tell him that you are scared and that you need him and his support to help face your parents.  He obviously knew that this was a possibility if you've already discussed it.    Good luck... it's time to grow up now.  Be strong and have faith.|`|cowH0YOeaa	just tell him and don't beat around the bush. just be honest|`|DlMsJPwUaa	Just tell him.In private though.    Good Luck with the pregnancy hun|`|BQXg09m9aa	Well...I was thinking something like this, "Babe, I'm pregnant".....or this, "I'm having a baby"......or this "What would you say if I told you I was pregnant?....well, I AM!".....It's reeally not that hard!!
JjBwydymaa	oo hun..    I think its hard one. I have has so many different things happen to me this month..ranging from unusual discharge, I was sick on 2 occasions and Im having constipation...but from past experience.. Im not getting my hopes up.. because every month there is alwas something abit different in my cycle.     The day that I do not have any symtoms will probably be the time that I am pregnant. If I was you, wait and see if you miss your period and then test.     Your the only person who knows your body is you, and if you feel that somethin is different... then just maybe you are.    Ill keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck, I hope you get your BFP . xx|`|9yz9V0j7aa	I don't believe in symptoms either. Last month I had thrown up (out of nowhere), was craving spicy food, thought I had some implantaion going on, very tired, and my boobs had NEVER been so sore/itchy....I thought I was FOR SURE pregnant. But no, lol I wasn't =(    Best thing for you to do is wait it out and if you miss your period, take a test. I'm due for AF Feb 13th and I am hoping & praying it doesn't come!!!    Good Luck, lots of baby dust!|`|m7lga8jOaa	I tried for ages for my second child and was so obsessed that I looked for symptoms every month, and probably imagined some, or took normal fatigue or nausea as a sign.  As soon as I was pregnant, I just knew and the fatigue was considerably more.  I mean it knocked me off my feet.  I don't want to give you false hope but if you have noticed these symptoms as being quite different to how you usually feel then there is a good chance that you are pregnant.  You know your body best.  Bit of advice tho, don't get too excited until you know anything for sure, or you will be terribly disappointed.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	I'm just gonna flat out say that I don't believe in symptoms.    I've had "temp dips", implantation cramping, sore boobs, fatigue, you name it, and it's never been pregnancy. Then, the one time I actually got pregnant, I had no symptoms whatsoever.    Sure lots of women get pregnancy symptoms but how much of it is an actual symptom of pregnancy, really? Just because you're 4 weeks along and you're hungry or your head hurts doesn't mean the headache is a pregnancy symptom. Yes, many women claim to have known because of certain symptoms, but more often than not the same women are crowing about symptoms that amount to nothing at the end of the month.    From my own personal experience, the only thing I rely on is a positive pregnancy test.  I'm 10 DPO right now and I have mega sore boobs, I had cramping 7 days after ovulation, but I'm not even thinking about it because I've had these symptoms before and it was nothing. In fact I'm positive I'm not pregnant right now because of these symptoms, lol.|`|AA11052660	Well I differ with (9) - symptoms are real for some women. Some symptoms are stronger indicators than others though.  For example, a missed period is, in my opinion, the number one symptom.  My other tell-tale symptoms were VERY sore boobs, and feeling faint.    Your symptoms, while they ARE classic pregnancy symptoms,they are also typically ones that could very easily be down to other things.  Cramping COULD be your period coming on.  The fatigue and hunger could be down to overworking etc.  They could also be symptoms of pregnancy
D5NkT1dUaa	more and more young people are doing so, and it is really sad. it is not completely normal but it is definitly becoming more common|`|3oGRNQKyaa	its not normal,and if someone thinks it is then they're not normal.But its much much more common,and numbers increase while age decreases,sadly.|`|vn0DHMXWaa	It is normal to smoke at 13, even younger, but it is unusual to drink at that age.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	i don't think it's entirely normal  most teneagers would've had some experience with alcohol probably a few sips or a small glass  i think it is quite unusual for 13 year olds to smoke   just keep in mind it's her life and if she wants to ruin it like that then it's her choice|`|aPdKEKyeaa	well im a 7th grader and i think that that is rele bad  its not normal to mee!|`|djjVYhWiaa	Sadly, it's getting to be pretty popular and mostly they are children who are trying to look "cool" or tough and to be accepted by older people.  It definitely should NOT be normal for any age to take part in such activities, but sadly it's happening and there's no way to stop it.  I'm twenty years old and think it's utterly stupid to waste money and life on excessive consumption of cigarettes, alcohol etc.|`|G7DlDjJhaa	Not normal for a 13 year old, totally normal for a 15 year old.  Its amazing how high school changes you.  That's all.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Young KIDS seem to be doing a lot of grown up things these days. I think not having, sex, smoking, or drinking is actually abnormal these days and it's a shame.|`|xcPghcw9aa	the world is getting uglier everyday|`|hswTS1jVaa	No it is not normal. It is very bad.|`|mweM8qoKaa	Idk if it's normal.  But the "in thing" these days seems to be trying not to be normal.  So maybe that has something to do with it.|`|KfBk9UMraa	It's not normal, but more younger kids are drinking and smoking. Yes, I think schools should do something about it like better education though if the kids are raised with parents that have ever done that then that's how they learn.   Boyfriends, no. I was in 6th when I got my first. People make out in 7th and stuff, so its not that weird nowdays.|`|Nngdk0izaa	It's sad and awful. 7th graders are just in middle school, they shouldn't be having boyfriends or drinking and smoking! I really don't know nowadays, but schools have been doing something about this.    At my school, 7th graders are required to take Health, were they learn about how smoking and drinks can affect a young person's body. I've seen how bad the lungs look, I've heard how you can die from drinking too much, they've told us about the affects after smoking and how addicting it is. It scared me, and I just feel sorry for everyone who does those things at a young age!     I don't know the answer to your question, but I think that isn't normal. 13 is a really young age, and I don't know how doing all those things will affect the 7th grade girl in the future.
UUpsa35Daa	When it comes to personality and qualities in a person, nurture over nature is way more important. No matter whose genes they have, the kind of people they become depends solely on how they were raised.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	absolutely!  the values and morals that your children will have will be the ones that you teach them.  Unless you let this man be a big part of your lives or get someone else who exhibits the same behaviours, then your child will turn out as good as how you teach them too.  best of luck|`|uNgslkwwaa	This sounds like a nature vs nuture question: is genetics more important than upbringing? It's a complex question but from my own view point while genetics has a bearing on a child the MOST important thing is how they are brought up. Science shows that children are on a ,generally, level playing field and it's their experiences and environment that shape their lives. If you can love, care and support your child(ren) then they'll be all ok. It'll be difficult and there will be a gap made by the lack of the father but love is what's needed. Spend time with them. Instruct them what's right and what's wrong and give them more praise than telling-off.     Some other, cleverer, people will give you more advice - make sure you have a support network made of men and women that you trust and get them involved in the child's life.     Hope this helps.
4c0zHQqWaa	I believe it would be 20.....?
Irm5gynTaa	i dont think you could really get into trouble, just put it as "a visit" untill your husband gets to his attourney. if anything, it is only a week..  ask his ex and her husband to respect your daughters wishes. maybe you could do 2 weeks your house, 2 weeks his house.  it's in the same town so it is not a huge delimma.  or, have her be legally emancipated and then she can live with you from there.  i'm 16 & emancipated, and live with my boyfriend and his dad.  ( we live in florida also )    google emancipation laws :)|`|fusIwst4aa	I'm not sure , if they can... but , they should be aloud, you are ALWAYS aloud to visit, anywayzz...good luck!  lovee,Skullprincess|`|Helbseg6aa	Hm. From what I know, as long as you haven't gone to court and gotten the custody finalized, a child older than 12 or..maybe 13, can decide which parent they want to live with.
HItbioaMaa	We know that Jesus compared death to sleep, which is what the dad (if he is serving Jehovah) should say. When this is no longer a sufficient answer, dad can update the answer to include the Resurrection promise. It certainly won't help to tell the son lies to 'make it easier' for him to understand. Young ones can put '2+2' together at a younger age than ever before, so it's always best to tell them the 'age appropriate' TRUTH from the beginning.|`|3oGRNQKyaa	''mommy has gone away to a better place,one day when ur older u will understand better but now all u need to know is that she is happy and she wants us to be happy to'' :)    i am sorry for ur loss,i never lose anyone close but i can imagine how hard it may be.  Bless you for looking after others.|`|tManvxfQaa	tell them the Truth    and explain to them that death is a part of life    he will find that out soon enough , and its wrong to tell a child a lie and to later find out what you told them was wrong...  Don't know their belief...But Gods Word is the Only Truth there is.....  It has to start right there !!|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	she is in heaven watching over you.|`|GrLIOUDgaa	Mommy is in heaven with God.

Thats wrong  That kid will have no closure  abandonment issues|`|Kg5KX432aa	depends on your religion (or lack of)...|`|zxRrpj3Laa	You can't really lie to a child especially if you want to keep the trust between you. Know what I mean? He's going to have to break it to his son that his Mommy is in Heaven and explain to him what Heaven is and all about. Don't forget to mention that she will always be with him in his heart and she is always watching out for him up above. It will take time but he will eventually understand. If not, there is also therapy to help break it to the child. Good luck and I am so sorry for the loss of a loved one.|`|quTKsQPhaa	The best thing to do would to just let him know that Mommy isn't coming back. If he says "Oh she'll be back later" or something like that it could hurt him in the future. I'm sorry about your loss.|`|ZYouNFQbaa	My son asked the same of his grandmother, i know its not quite the same situation, but we told him:    She is up in Heaven with the angels, she is safe and happy and watches over us all the time to keep us safe and happy. When you look out in the night and see a star twinkle extra bright it is her smiling at you, you can talk to her if you want to and she can hear you she just can't talk back to you. She wasn;t feeling very well and this was the only way for her to be better. She will always be with you don't worry. Its ok to miss her too.    Good luck x

xPgKWIigaa	do you mean years honey? If so - get him something related to whatever he is interested in  If you question is worded correctly, then wait until a year - when it is his birthday and buy him something age appropriate - they are so many things in the shops, strangers dont really have any idea what your sonis interested in|`|VNC6UieFaa	u reall should wait till his birthday and if u dont u can try getting him a tedddy or another soft toy thats all as hey dont really kno and dont fuss anyway!!!!!|`|4c0zHQqWaa	5 months old!?!?!?!!?

2ZOkyoSJaa	Yes, implantation spotting happens usually right around the time of your usual AF, sometimes a little earlier. With my son I had implantation bleeding 3 days before my AF, it was not spotting for me though it was a streak of bright red and nothing else.

Uk27zzQcaa	The best diaper i bought for my son was the diapers at Walmart, I cant remember the name but they are in a yellow package. I chose these diapers because they were cheap (35 diapers for $5.50) and did not leak. Buying expensive diapers like huggies,luvs, ect. are a waist of money. Really, their only gonna pee and poop in them.    Your three year old should have been off the pacifier at about a year old. Pacifiers can ruin the teeth and give overbites. Take that pacifier away.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	pampers?|`|zHRWklEWaa	Pampers are the best, but they do irritate some sensitive skin in whitch case Huggies are better.  I would try to get the three year old off the pacifier to prevent his teeth from being damaged.
8am8ExsKaa	I tried all brands with my son and I really like Luvs. They had the best leak protection and they are much much cheaper than huggies and pampers. But I didn't choose them b/c them were cheaper I really think they were better diapers.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	no pacifier for your 3 year old...  pampers are good diapers...  do you have any parentals in your life that can guide you along with all of your children and that are there to help you...|`|0Cpqulbraa	hahahaha. your life sucks. who cares if you are religious a condom can do no harm idiot. if i was you i would change my name and get the **** out of their. the ***** ur havin the kids with is probly tuke as well|`|rFMRgHTdaa	well with that many kids you should already know.  and no take that pacifier from your baby now!|`|VUss5AfAaa	i herd swadlers becasue they are 100 % cotton.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I prefer Huggies.

Wow.|`|7ktbbv2Maa	LUVS ARE THE BEST I USE THEM FOR MY TWINS AND I USE HUGGIES OR PAMPERS BABY FRESH WIPES CANT BEAT THEM   THEY ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT LAST ALL NIGHT I BELIEVE OF COURSE IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU KIDS DRINK|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	I call bullcrap!!!|`|yZWhgvgHaa	Why are you telling us your life story if all you want to know is what kind of diapers are the best and if your 3 year old should be suckin on a binkie? I don't get it...      Anywho....    If you are trying to go cheap i love White Cloud Diapers. You can only get them at WalMart.     If you want to go name brand... then I love Huggies. I think they absorb really good and seem pretty comfy (my son never has issues with em).They also have Mickey Mouse on them... which my son LOVES!    As far as the pacifier goes. No... a 3 year old should not be using a pacifier. You should start weaning your kid asap... he/she is a little old to be using one of those.
abAaKBt1aa	Are you 100% sure that it couldn't be you?    Do you know the answers to the following questions:    1.  What's your FSH and LH levels (Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)?  2.  Do you have endometriosis?  3.  Do you have adenomyosis?  4.  Do you have PCOS?  5.  Do you have any fibroids?  6.  Are your fallopian tubes blocked or damaged in any way?  7.  How's your thyroid?  Are you hypothyroid?    All of the above questions can only be answered by tests run by an OB/GYN.  If you haven't been thoroughly checked by a physician, you can't know for sure that it's not you.|`|ecBx744aaa	well hun the best bet is to go talk to a doctor we cant tell you if its him or you!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Are you sure?   It could be him, 50% of a couples infertility is from the dude.   After a year it's time for you both to be checked out.|`|bcZSIphUaa	Are you sure there is nothing wrong?    Have you been checked out by doctor?    The infertility could be female (50% chance) or male (50% chance).    Make sure you are both checked out - he needs to get sperm count done and you both need hormone levels checked.    Look up PCOS if you are overweight or get irregular periods.|`|jKMH27gKaa	Sure, it could be him. Also could be when in your cycle you are trying; do you keep track of when you are most fertile? Only a doc can run all the appropriate tests on you both -- assuming you have already done this and that's why you know it's not you (past pregnancy does not mean you are still in the clear -- problems may have developed since then). Ask him if he would mind going to the doctor with you to discuss this, and broach the question with your doc to see what tests might be run on you both.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	You should both see your doctors for a checkup.
AA10285288	Cool, Slappy! You are the most awesomest babby namer ever!|`|UA8zGGTsaa	Nice one... how do you like this name for a babby boy?    Iammar Etard|`|aY3s1B9xaa	No...not really.  The kid will be called Plop, Plop-plop, Peony, or whatever else kids come up with in school.  Go for a shorter name too if you can but if you really like it, then do it.  Good luck.|`|5FfQkPQ2aa	no|`|U49so236aa	its beautiful|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	yes, very handsome name for a boy|`|AA11138222	Do you like to spell BABY wrong every time?|`|2rOQyvaKaa	And Leanbow means "powerful leader" in my culture.|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	Sorry, I can't say I do.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I'm sorry, but even if it is a cultural thing, if you are living in America, try for something better.  Besides no one will know what it means and he will be teased in school.|`|TffCSzHxaa	Very nice. How about Drinkinpeepi or Eetinpeye?|`|TYl7kmPeaa	nice answer score  and no i dont like this name at all  sorry dude|`|kdW99oHvaa	Well, if you like it, its your kid. Never really heard of it in my culture. But sure, if you like :]|`|xhVe918waa	I personally do not like it,  but it's your baby,  do what you like. :]|`|pLcUFBl2aa	well your culture better think of better names or you better quit asking questions. how do you even pronounce that?!|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	wtf... ur not serious right?|`|32lv9NmKaa	um um no
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	For me personally i am 34 weeks and my fiance still hasnt felt the baby move, he has seen the baby move but everytime he puts his hand on my belly the baby will quit moving. i know it sounds crazy but it is like our little boy knows whether it is me trying to feel him move or  not. Hopefully things will go better for you.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  14 weeks : bubbles- every now and then.  for me from inside was 16 weeks : movements : every now and then  20 - 22 weeks : my partner felt bubs inside.    god bless x he will feel bubs sooner than later. --> excitement will really begin. More bubs is developed the more bigger they are.stronger the movements|`|rHufcHwHaa	My ex-boyfriend was able to (finally) feel the baby move this week, I'm 25 weeks.  I felt her move with my hand on my stomach at 22 weeks, though..so i guess it's just a matter of being there at the right time.  She doesn't always kick hard enough for me to feel it outside, but she is doing it more and more frequently.|`|tjay33Raaa	I'm 20 weeks this week and like you I've been feeling them a few weeks back. My husband cant feel them yet either - really wishing he could though!|`|Q6Ihs4otaa	Well im 28 weeks and 5 days..   I first felt my baby move when i was exactly 3 months he kicked. and it felt like someone flicked my from the inside of my tummy 3 times. (it brought tears to my eyes   My boyfriend would always try to feel him but when he put his hand on me the baby would completely stop moving.. he used to say the baby is scared of him or he felt like the baby didn't like him. but here try this i did this and still do this if you drink really cold water  and lay down the baby will move. once you turn 28 weeks you will have to do that every week they're called kick counts. but it makes the baby move. i promise. oh and when your boyfriend puts his hand on your tummy make sure his hand is barley on there. i think thats why they don't move they know our touch which mine is light but my bf puts his big man hand on there its heavier than mine and baby won't move.  good luck! hope i helped
NuZjVW6vaa	I think western names with asian last names sound fine together.  Think Brenda Song from Disney channel and Michael Chang - sports star. Bruce and Brandon Lee. There are many examples.  Jack is the sort or name that will go with just about anything.  Good luck choosing and congratulations on your little boy.|`|AA11138222	I think that you should choose one from each culture and use one for the first name and one for the middle. In fact, Jack Seung would sound fine together! Remember, this child is a part of both of you, and his name should reflect that. :)|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Jack Seung     I think Jack would be a good name with the same last name|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Western names w/Asian last are just fine.  Why not compromise and name him Jack if you like w/Seung as a middle name?|`|uNizUHJVaa	well, i live in new jersey and there are tons of Asians here.  they usually use their American names as there first names and Asian names as their middle names.  either way they sound pretty normal.    my parents couldn't decide on my name so they fought so much about it that the nurse waiting couldn't handle it and decided to name me after her mother (yes the nurses mother).  so decide beforehand!|`|BPuyPpNkaa	Why not Jack Seung and call him Jackson?|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	I don't like either one to be honest. Jack makes me think of dogs. Not people.     I think naming your son a traditional korean name is cool, but if you can't both agree give him a korean middle name.|`|SCc6f3Uraa	Well, when I said those two names out loud (Jack and Seung) it sounded like Jackson, so why don't you name him that...Jackson. Without knowing the last name, I don't know how it would sound.|`|ApYYZoxoaa	combined western and asian names is cool|`|3YZ8QF7waa	I think western names with Asian last names sound great! One of my friend's name is Zachary Yoo. Doesn't that sound good?
dzyJw0cvaa	NOOOOOO!!!!  NO NO NO NO NO!!!!  He is a SEXUAL PREDATOR!! There is NO reason a 25 year old man should be hanging out with girls this young!  It is not healthy and NOT OK!  keep your daughter away from him before something BAD happens.      I was 15 when i met my bf and he was 20.  My whole family loved him.  My mother especially.  She thought he was wonderful and my parents both trusted him. He even went so far as to go to church with us to prove how great he was. It turns out, he had been dating multiple other GIRLS and women at the same time.  All he wanted with me was sex and he got it.  i was pregnant and married at 16 and divorced 6 years later after years of lies and cheating. it turns out he has seven children that i know of with six other women. And those are the only ones i know of...  I know this situation might be slightly different that yours, but morally its the EXACT SAME THING.  He is out for one thing and one thing only.  This is how sexual predators work!  they arent big burly ugly men that give you the willies!!  They are younger, attractive guys that treat you well, make you laugh and lure you into the trap.  Keep your daughter safe and keep her away.  He is NO good and he needs to hang around WOMEN his own age.  not little girls.  Your daughter is still a little girl, she is only fifteen!  She is RAW CHICKEN and when a guy craves raw chicken something is wrong with him!!    I'm sorry this is so long, but i now have a daughter myself because of the sexual predator i was tangled with and i know for a FACT she will NOT date anyone over 18 until she is 18 herself, if i can help it.  Its scary.      GOOD LUCK.  I hope i helped!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	No way he is too old to even want to hang out with girls that young. Something is wrong there. I would never let my daughter hang out with a man that old.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	NO DONT!!!  if you are ok with it then i would just have them rent a movie and get take out at your house.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Does the word Rape mean anything to you??|`|qRElKKjXaa	I sincerely hope you are a troll.     I'm 17 and fairly liberal-minded and I even I can answer this with a resounding NO. This is just a recipe for disaster.    A decent 25 year old man doesn't go out with a 15 year old girl, or befriend them. I sometimes IM with older ppl, but I'd never, ever, EVER actually go out with one and them and my parents would freak out if I did.     He could easily manipulate her into having sex with him or doing something she's not ready for. In every state in the nation it's illegal for someone over the age of 21 to sleep with a 15 year old.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Are you Nucking Futs?  A 25 year old who you know to be immature, with your 15 year old daughter?  And you have known him for a whopping 2 months.  Hmmm...  Why don't you send her out with a cheerleader outfit and handcuffs too, while you are at it?  A 25 year old MAN has nothing in common with a 15 year old GIRL.  He is thinking with his lower brain.  Don't let her go.|`|AA11049717	Are you really a parent? No real parent in their right mind would allow that to happen. Be a parent not a friend!|`|AA11091315	You said so yourself that you're suspicious. So, hell no!|`|a12cbnR4aa	Do you know anything about this guy? Have you checked your state's sex offender registry? he is 25, living alone, and talking to 15 year old girls. There is something wrong with that. Go with your gut and keep your girls away from this freak. Its illegal and sick. I got sick to my stomach when I read this.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	NO NO NO.....there is a reason he likes 15 year olds, like you said, it's because he is immature.  Let me tell you a story.  My stepdaughter lived with her bio mom and stepdad at 15 years old.  They had a family friend who was in his early 20's....24 years old, and they used to hang out all the time in seemingly innocent ways, outings, etc.  What ended up happening is that they fell in love and she got pregnant.  My stepdaughter is now almost 20 years old, still hasn't graduated high school, and has a newborn and a toddler.  He has been laid off several times and they live with his parents and five brothers!!!!!      Is this what you want for your 15 year old?  Be very very careful what you promote right now.  I can guarantee you that the bio mom thought that be being involved and it being a family friend there was no way for this to happen, and she inadvertently promoted the whole thing!!!!|`|prqrQcd1aa	If you have to ask if this is alright, i assume that you are just joking... if you are not then what you are asking is the equivalent to handing your child over to a pedophile.|`|cNVTtkgmaa	I wouldn't.|`|leKeIi4yaa	Well, if you don't mind your daughter getting an STD or getting pregnant at 15, let her go.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	I would say no! I'm 25 and although female I understand that some guys are less mature than women, having said that if he's interested in hanging out with a couple of 15 year olds then he's not a 'normal' 25 year old, despite being an okay guy. I would treat this situation with extreme caution, he may seem nice but his motives are unknown to you and your naive daughter, she probably sees it as extremely cool that an older guy wants her company. I dunno, it's a hard one but I wouldn't completely trust his motives and try to find out more about this man before you let him take your daughter and her friend out, he's bound to be interested in one of them and just using the other as a decoy, I'd be careful. It's not ungeard of for guys this age to be interested in girls her age, I know a 28 yr old man who's fascinated with a 17 yr old, that's 11 years difference, she may be over the age of consent but it doesn't make it right. Ask yourself WHY is he their good friend?|`|wv5PiHxcaa	I can't think of a single reason why you would let her date him.    why do you think a 25 year old guy would want to date a 15 year old girl?  What happens if he has sex with her?  He'll go to jail.     That's sick and he shouldn't even be thinking about wanting to date her.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Are you nuts??????????  No way would I allow this!!  If he wants to see them, he needs to see them  when you are around...  Be Suspicious!!!!!!!!!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I thnk your gut telling you to be unsure, is already tell you the answer|`|PJorKi5Yaa	no. 25 year old men should really be starting families, smoking, drinking, and all that.    A 15 year old cant do none of that!|`|WSIZKAQcaa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|A40jdi5Naa	uhh...NO     honestly she might get raped or something but not tell u....that hashappen befor....|`|Kg5KX432aa	please tell me this question is a joke  of course you shouldn't|`|Bo4oGgf8aa	Are you kidding? Yeah, if you don't care about your daughter and you are dumb, let them date. The ONLY thing a 25 year old man could want with a LITTLE girl like that is.....Well, you know!|`|yxAM9b8Zaa	that's f'ed up|`|JKtthwaMaa	I think thats weird. And im a guy.  Hell no|`|AA10876072	No way!  I'm a parent of 3 grown children.    That would be like my 30 year old asking a 15 year old out.  Please.    This 25 year old needs to look elsewhere for friends.  You as a parent need to protect your daughter.    You've known this 25 year old for 2 months.  Oh my goodness.  That's not long enough to know anything about this guy.    How would you feel if something happened and your daughter couldn't protect herself from him and you could have prevented the whole thing by not allowing the relationship.    A 15 year old isn't mature in the mind yet to handle a 25 year old man.      I say NO CHANCE!    Protect her from this relationship.|`|RsXCY7wuaa	under no circumstances let your daughter go out with a 25 year old man your daughter might think it is Innocent but you don't know what that man wants.|`|v0Sn3V9Qaa	Oh yeah, go for it.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I wouldn't. I think that's pretty odd that he's hanging out with 15 year old girls.  Maybe he's just immature and his intentions are good, but you can never be sure.  I wouldn't trust a 25 year old man out alone with my daughter like that.  He really should find some people his own age to hang out with.  Please keep your daughter away from him before she gets hurt, because it could easily happen.|`|cUCtK4zCaa	If you have to ask people the answer to this question then you really really need some parenting classes..    No No No      Good Luck   Tonya|`|gFwD0yeCaa	NO! You said you think he may be immature for his age, but that doesn't mean he should be hanging around with girls who are in high school. He is a 25 year old man you have a right to be suspicious. Of course he seems cool, he's old enough to drink and owns his own place and car. Its called statutory rape. He may not have put a move on these girls yet, but he's working up to it with the whole dinner and a movie bit. Tell him to go to a bar and find a girl his own age to take to the movies and to leave your daughter alone. Talk to the other girl's mother and get her to do the same. Tell your daughter she can make plans with a classmate for the movies. Then sit down and have a long conversation with your daughter about sexual predators because it sounds like thats what this man is.|`|A9cMmbueaa	.......no!!!!!!!!!!! 15 and 25 tht says it all|`|NAzAmFDnaa	It is NOT normal for a 25yr old man to be interested in 15yr old girls.  Something is not right with him.  Plenty of girls and women are abused by "friends" and most rapes are by aquaintences.  He can find friends his own age.  The fact that perhaps he can't find friends his own age should tell you something isn't quite right.  Be a "mean" mom and tell her no.  She'll probably be mad and might even start sneaking around to see him.  You might do a police search or sex offender search about him.  Put your foot down.  Do you really think anything good can come of this?
puCOYwMmaa	Thanks for the link!!
JpmKtpqmaa	it is totally wrong!!!!|`|QSodlfMraa	well i was 12 and my boy friend was 16 now we are 19 and 22  and still going, so i dont see what so wrong about that, chill out dude.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	3 years is not that bad when ur looking at 18  and 21 and up but a 16 and a 13 year old are on different maturity levels and mental levels|`|Jucak0HLaa	That's way to old.My parents would have never let me do that.Ugh.|`|fKDZlxOsaa	You're right. He wants to get some action, and she wants to feel "grown up". they aren't in love, that's why it's called puppy love.|`|QmPuip7Raa	thats way too old!! tell him to "STAWP IIIIT!!!"|`|QGkBZFqWaa	FREAKIN UGH.  I think your friend just wants to put his P in a V.|`|nkZdtXXhaa	That's a little sketchy....|`|7MKmxkjlaa	thats so wrong .... i understand once you get in your like ... 20's and your independant it doesn't matter anymore ... but he will know too much that she doesn't ... i think thats totally innapropriate!|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	She probably hasn't even hit puberty yet. I'm sure we all know EXACTLY what he's looking for. Tell him to grow up and find someone his own age instead of putting that poor girl through all that. He's almost 16 and she's 12, that's not right.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes, she is too young.|`|KIzrFkYAaa	Thats completely sick. She's a KID! He's ACTING like a child that cannot control his actions!!!!|`|tbpNk6rBaa	When they are older and have matured a little, they will still be a few years apart of course but they will move on, so if they were older I would say it wasn't that bad, but honestly, a 12 year old shouldn't be making out w. anyone.|`|AA12005593	that's pretty gross, i'm not gonna lie.  he's going to grow up to be a child molester.|`|WHbNf5bnaa	dang! thats way 2 young to makeout man|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	eww  thats to young  maybe if it is like 26 and 23 but 16 aand 13 ew|`|x9REbxP1aa	Yeahhh the 12 year old is going to put out and your friend only wants the sex..|`|RLMcpYheaa	Ew.  Way too much age difference between those two.  It wouldn't matter if they were older, but since they are still teens, I think that's just plain wrong.|`|kdxxuQwNaa	You seem to know a lot about this...|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	i agree with you that's not normal the age difference is too big
cnp21qZJaa	dried blood (happened to a friend, she bleed like an artery was ruptured or something!) its nothing to worry about! if it lasts for weeks on end- then talk to a dr.  and he used a condom! go you! if he didnt ***, then the chances are drastically reduced, add that to condom use and youre looking at about a 99.9% chance there is no way you could be preg.  and an fyi- it usually takes 3 days for an egg to get fertilized in the first place. it has to fight its way past our body's defenses to get to the egg and by then most sperm are dead.|`|hrEQXFdYaa	I really really think the brown stuff is old blood because he wore a condom and he didnt finish.... chances are no, but please keep being SAFE :)|`|77NzfiVkaa	Then wait and take a pregnancy test and stop being stupid. Use a condom or get on birth control. No one on here is going to be able to tell you if you are pregnant.|`|p3d3E75oaa	ummmmm lol I'm not in your body you just gotta wait it out!
JLP5IhFDaa	Pretty stupid. DON'T LOOSE YOUR BUTTHOLE.|`|C2U8qR8zaa	that is stupid....one line is negative and two lines means positive...pretty easy|`|01vMpHkWaa	lol i think the same|`|Fr29Bteaaa	lmfao x]|`|p3d3E75oaa	lol|`|Kg5KX432aa	hahaha my thoughts exactly|`|tj6MgJujaa	HA!  well, maybe there can be a stupid defect on the test making that woman all lost and confused and freakin worry more!  But that's sooooo true. LOL.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	How stupid are every 1 in 4 women who keep having unprotected sex, then they won't have to read a g** damn thing.  I have to say, YES sex is good and YES you can get caught up in the moment.  But who wants to have to deal with the consequences I can say that the two times that I thought I was pregnant was not a good experience.  Not only did I have to worry about a child I did not plan, but other grave consequences that could have changed my life forever|`|ehvzQRkkaa	haha! me too!|`|cLfIJgudaa	it's probably because they are in either jr high or high school. therefore they are too stupid to be having sex in the first place.|`|60mDEusiaa	Yeah, I don't believe that one second. Unless, she lost the instructions or the lines aren't made out right on the test. They just want people to pay more money so the test reads out "pregnant" or "not pregnant".

K2jT1z5jaa	hey    1st picture you look : 7 weeks & 3 days.  2nd picture you look : 12 weeks - 13 weeks.  3rd picture you look around 10 weeks.    your bigger than an average 7 weeks along for first pregnancy.. unless its mostly bloating. Bubs is very very small at this stage. Unless you may be carrying two or more. Depends on person.  god Bless x    i think you are further along. doctors utrasound will help|`|rHufcHwHaa	you need a password to access that picture, but at 7 weeks you shouldn't really be showing yet.    EDIT- It worked the second time i tried, haha.  You look completely normal to me!|`|T8zPA3FJaa	looks further than 7 weeks to me .. or you're pushing out your belly.|`|McRoWQrAaa	lol that is soo cute!(:  you look like 3-4 months, eeeh.|`|UeDGiKSyaa	You look really big for 7 weeks.|`|5f6XnInEaa	That's big for 7 weeks....you sure your only 7?|`|kQC4HX6vaa	No way!    I'm 15 weeks and I still don't show : (    You have a lovely baby bump!|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	The second and last pic makes you look about 2 months along|`|MGBh4dcnaa	that looks like one healthy baby to me. Your belly is the right size for how far you are in the pregnancy; my belly was a bit bigger at that stage.
rHwMf2P4aa	Missing birth control pills does make it more likely to get pregnant but it is a very slim chance unless you miss a whole week. With birth control there is a instruction guide on what to do if you miss a pill and when. They are all different and I don't know which kind you are taking at the time. Read the instructions and follow them. Do you have three active pills left until you start your period (inactive pills)  or do you just have three inactive pills left in the pack? Because if you are on your last three inactive pills have haven't started your period yet that could be a little cause for concern. If you really feel uncomfortable go take a pregnancy test to be sure or get a check up from your gynecologist. Also with birth control you should be using another form of contraceptive. Such as condoms, or gel ect. I take birth control and have a alarm set on my phone so I don't forget when to take them. I know it is a pain to remember and it just slips your mind. Anyways if you have anymore concerns feel free to email me and always ask a doctor.|`|77NzfiVkaa	If you take the pill you missed the very next day then you are fine. If you miss two in a row though you could very easily get pregnant.|`|PGJKLZCVaa	its possible. but too likely. i wouldn't stress|`|OI3bf4yjaa	There is always a chance of pregnancy. Whether it's very likely or not very likely. Birth control isn't 100% effective anyways. Was it protected? If it wasn't, the chances of pregnancy will increase.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Taking a double dose won't make any difference, you should just remember to take it religiously and be more careful, there is a chance you could be pregnant but you'll have to wait and see.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	you have to take pills as directed.   if you dont your odds of being pregnant go up. i had a freind that got pregnant at 16 the first time she had sex. if taken out of order your pills may not work . some are made so that every  3rd day you get the anti baby stuff. and other days are fillers|`|AA11766296	you should read the packet that came with the pills.|`|e81B9pDKaa	Yea theres a good chance u could be pregnant|`|yuOuoCfDaa	stop wondering and start having protected sex.

In case you forget again get some condoms or contraceptive foam or film to provide extra back up. Keep a calender of your pill missed days and watch for your cycle. Talk to your Dr about a longer term product like a shot or a patch so you don't forget to take your prevention. Good Luck!|`|DeNMyLtXaa	i guess... 90% you'll get pregnant.

6mhFHSRSaa	Babies can apparently hear sounds in the womb at 30 weeks.     Research hasn't shown whether babies recognize Dad's voice in the womb (or how soon they do, anyway), but babies do recognize mom's voice and can distinguish it from other voices. Mom's voice will understandably become recognizable, largely because the sound comes from the same body that is housing the baby, so it is the voice that baby will hear most frequently.     While researchers aren't sure whether Dad's voice will be recognized, they do theorize that it may depend on how often the baby hears Dad talking.     In any event, if your husband is back at 25 weeks, you have about 5 weeks before recognizing voices will even be an issue. I wouldn't worry about it. Especially if dad is a talker!|`|gOOR3qdNaa	the babys mind might not know his voice, but babys heart will.  (:|`|XTDeAfTqaa	What are you talking about? The baby will meet Daddy when it's born.

VFEjLgvuaa	anytime you have unprotected sex you can get pregnant. And the saying about you cant get pregnant the first time you have sex or when your on your period is totally bogus. I got pregnant the night I lost my virginity and Ive gotten pregnant while on my period as well so yes, she could be but she shouldnt be having sex at 13 anyways let alone without a condom. How could she possibly be emotionally or physically ready for sex or a baby at the age I know I wasnt. I was 17 when I lost my virginity and 17 when I had my first kid. My dad then took my child because he thought I was "to young to be a mom" so, I think your friend needs to wake up and realize what shes doing and if she insists on having intercourse at her age then she needs to be on birth control and use condoms to protect herself from pregnancy and or sexually transmitted diseases. I hope for her sake and her parents and the boy and his parents sake that she lucked out and isnt pregnant and doesnt have any std's|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	It's a high chance if she didn't use a condom...if she did use a condom, it's 99.9% effective. And tell your little friend to keep her legs shut till she's old enough to know the consequences..she sounds pretty ignorant/ uneducated about sex. Yes, she could most definitely be pregnant..and if she is then so be it..she decided she was ready for adulthood so now she has to face adult consequences. daammnn when will you people ever learn? sex is not a game...|`|WHbNf5bnaa	i think she will get pregnant because guys sperm really fast in a girls vagina|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	A condom is at least a safety against it still it is likely she is OK. She does need to talk to her Dr about better protection and get checked for other possible problems. I am sure you know 13 is very young and it is very important she get medical attention to prevent cervical cancer and other sexually transmitted problems. Please encourage her to see her Dr - she can ask to be alone and have her mom or guardian leave the room - but she needs to be careful and get the proper care. Good Luck!|`|tj6MgJujaa	FIRST OFF...........IS YOUR FRIEND STUPID??????????????!!!!!!!  SHE'S ONLY 13! SHE HAS NO BUSINESS LETTING NO GUY UP IN HER! SHE'S STILL A BABY. SHE JUST BECAME A TEENAGER!   WTF!!!!   THAT'S A DAMN SLAP FROM HER MOM WAITING TO HAPPEN AND TO BE HONEST I HOPE SHE GETS IT TOO.  MAYBE THEN SHE'LL LEARN SOMETHING!  BUT DAMN STRAIGHT SHE MIGHT BE PREGNANT!  SHE'S NOT IMMUNE TO PREGNANCY!  YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU SHOULD SLAP HER.  TELL HER SHE JUST RUINED HER LIFE WITHIN THE FIRST 13 YEARS!!!!  AND YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU BETTER TAKE HER MISTAKE AND LEARN FROM IT TOO.  I'M JUST BEING HONEST AND STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.  SHE SHOULD DO A TEST. ASAP!|`|mSVlAsGhaa	Did she have sex while on her period? ewwww  Yes it is possible.  She needs to cross her legs.  13 years old and having sex. What a moron.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	your "friend" is stupid.  she has a high chance of getting pregnant.  she's the one that needs to be worried, not you.  she needs to get help.|`|JtMoUpJIaa	the chance i think really depends on their fertility but the best option would be a pregnancy test       but i mean 13!?|`|4cn5R5FWaa	dont worry kidyy. you boobs are so young, her bf probally cant even *** yet. haha|`|88c3e2070aa044657a46bc78e662b967aa	The likelihood that she is pregnant depends a lot on what day of her cycle she had sex - pregnancy is most likely if she had sex between 11 and 17 days from the first day of her period.  Among couples who are trying to become pregnant, so intentionally have sex on those days, a study showed 38% became pregnant in the first month (ie. from having sex a few times in those most fertile days).  During other times of the month, the chances are much lower.  So it is possible she's pregnant, but by no means certain.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	That was a very irresponsible thing to do at 13.  She has a good chance of getting pregnant ANY time she has sex.  She shouldn't be having sex at 13 because SHE COULD END UP PREGNANT!!!   Tell your friend that if it has been within 72 hours of having sex that she can take plan B, but she'll need a prescription for it or she'll have to go to a planned parenthood.  If it has been longer than 72 hours, she's going to have to wait until her period is late and take a test.  If she does get a period, then she needs to go straight to her doctor or a planned parenthood and get on birth control and stock up on condoms and spermicide.  And she has to USE them every time she has sex!|`|7NXmvm7oaa	She is a whoooore|`|aiBzKyjlaa	im assuming she is not on the pill, so there is the chance that she is pregnant.|`|VUss5AfAaa	hun her mistake she has to be responsible for her own actions.  its a good thing you worry about her (good friend) but theres not much you can do but support her.    if she gets pregnant tell her there are choices in adoption if she dosnt want to keep the baby(its not the baby's fault for her dumb actions)  and the chances are very high hun.

Jswomud7aa	If you live in the US PLEASE don't name your poor lil guy Ding Bat... I mean, come on! Do you want him to get made fun of his whole life?    For the girl I like Cherry Mae, that sounds so cute, but you say it out loud it sounds kind of like a stripper name...    The only one that is sort of ok is Valerreia Lauren Lai... Come up with better boy names|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Just give the child a Chinese name at birth and a English name. My Chinese name is Chingwan Jinyung, but I hardly use it. But at home, my parents calls me that name because it's my Chinese names and I am half Chinese. Outside of home, I use my English names which is Merrick Swordon. Ryuguno is my nickname. I would go with Leon Marcus Lai. It looks weird to mix it up with the English name. Ding Bat Sun just look weird.|`|KIzrFkYAaa	How about pairing an american name with the name "Mae" it is very cultured now to pair two different cultured names together. So how about Lin Mae or Ellie Mae or Charlotte Mae or Mollie Mae?|`|asX2hxFXaa	Is this a joke, or do you seriously not realize that "Ding Bat" is an English slang for an idiot?    You really want to name you kid "Idiot"?|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Ding Bat in English is slang for someone "stupid".  Sorry but it is.  I luv Marcus Lai and Valerreia Lauren Lai.  Valerreia is uncommon but sounds so pretty.  (Is it possible to eliminate Ding Bat and just use Sun?)|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Ding Bat really is a Chinese name. I think it's great you're using traditional names. I think you should conpromise.     You pick the first name of the boy, she pick the middle.    She pick the first name of the girl, you pick the middle.    I like Mark Ding Bat Sun Lai & Lauren Ping Lai,    But I'm only American, so I'm not sure of the sentimental value of the traditional chinese names. I hope I helped. Good luck and Congrats!|`|0hT85XLzaa	Ding Bat?

Peice of cake.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	I would shoot myself if my name was ding bat sun!!!!!!!! I think that girls names are all okay, and for a boy use an american name they are sooooo much nicer!!!! You could also use lily or amy for a girl they are sort of chineseish sounding names.|`|e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	My kids are Chinese-American. They have 4 names (first name, last name and two middle names).  But like the first answerer said, I wouldn't use "Ding Bat" it is slang for "brainless" in English.     My kids' first name and first middle name are Anglo, their second middle name and last name are Chinese. Since they are being raised in the U.S., we use the Anglo names for their everyday names. They are welcome to use their Chinese names if they like when they are older. My husband's parents call them by their Chinese names, which is to be expected. We let my husband's mother pick the Chinese names.     My kids are twins, one boy and one girl. :)|`|BgZA7lvQaa	Since you are having twins, can you name 1 with a Chinese name and the other with an English name?  Or can you make the first name English and second Chinese or Chinese first English second?    LOL, and is your wife is having twins or both of you are having them?
rHufcHwHaa	usually, yes.  your primary residence determines where you go to school.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yes unless they can transport you back and forth to your school   have them check with the board office or the office at the school to see if that can be done
xkqjtawKaa	There's over the counter pain medicine to put on the tooth. It's a nasty brown liquid, and it usually comes in a kit. It's tastes horrible, but that's what I used when I was pregnant. Also, you can go to your dentist to see if he has any options. They don't always need to put you under to take the wisdom tooth out...sometimes a local will do it, but the only drawback is the Novocaine shots. It's a little painful, but you don't feel anything after that.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	They can pull it without putting you under. They can just numb the area, pull the tooth and give you a prescription for a mild pain reliever and possibly antibiotics (if you need them). You will probably feel like crap the first day or two but after that you will feel so much better! I think it would be best to try to take care of it before the baby comes.    Good Luck!|`|v0GwTTsVaa	I hope your doctor can suggest something to you.  That has got to be rough.  I hope either your doctor or your dentist does something for you.  Good luck and congrats on your baby boy.|`|msKHbeCzaa	If it's just one tooth that's not so bad. I'm sure they can just numb the area as best they can, it will probably still hurt some, but better than going on like this. But to get the best answer, call the dentist office.|`|2FUjIpZKaa	My husband got his wisdom teeth pulled with out having to go under.  You should call several dentist offices to see how they do things and see what they think is safe for you situation.      Good luck and congratulations!|`|AA11914352	i dont think it would afect the baby, because when they pull your teeth out the pain only last one day and its sensitive for 3 more days and thats it you would be able to eat everything you want after 4 or 5 days, take it out it would be the best.|`|nTcHpDhmaa	extra strength tylenol? orajel? I don't know what i think i should suggest to you, on one hand i think you should get it out right away(like my dentist told me, once the babies out immediately come get that tooth out) because your already going to be in pain and taking pain meds, but on the other hand i want to tell you not to do it because i don't want you to be scarficing time with your brand new baby because your in too much pain to enjoy any of it. well i guess i hope that helps, good luck.|`|kZFov1x6aa	I think you should talk to your dr.. if you are unable to eat properly that would be effecting your baby.. They may induce you a little bit earlier if they think its serious enough for you and the baby. .. leaving the tooth in and risking worse infection could be even more harmful for your baby especially should the infection spread to your blood stream. I would talk to you doc asap
82f043b1137f728dcb7c4cf9e405a0bbaa	I'm going to tell you what you already know; it's a possibility. You did have sex around the time when most women ovulate, but I would recommend using an online ovulation calculator to see exactly when you were ovulating. Try this: http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calc...    Dollar Tree sells a pregnancy test for $1 that is just as accurate as First Response. Wait a few more days and give one a try.     Best wishes!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    You need to grab a test darling.  you have already missed your period. i would definitely wait one more week and test.    cramping is sign of pregnancy.    God Bless x i thnk you are|`|PKyzcW7Faa	ask a friend to buy you the test wait for boyfriend to come back and give the news if it's a positive test. Good luck|`|AA10976444	Yes its possible to be pregnant.  Don't you havre your own money??|`|vJP6yTy3aa	you can get the dollar store tests for a dollar.  how old are you?  i think that unless you can support a child, you need to not have sex.  or, get a job.|`|cnp21qZJaa	always use protection- the pull out method does not work. especially against STDs. i would use the friend method. if you dont have a friend- are you due for a pap test? you should have 1 starting at 16. use the pap test as an excuse- or spend the night at a friends house if you do have a friend willing to be a cover up story- and if you are support until boyfriend gets back.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	its definately a possibility- but it is not unusual for many women to be late.  is it stressful staying with his parents while he is out of state? because stress can delay a period as well.  I would wait a few more days until u push the panic button- then go and get a test.  Or ask a friend to get you one if it is possible. u might not want to tell anyone, but getting a friend to get you a test would be good for you- cuz you would have someone there with you when you did it!  hope it works out either way!! good luck|`|85a713567f6b7a60be0ef9d72bf0790daa	Chance are you are not knocked up. Having sex can irregulate your cycle. Its only two days. If it was two weeks, then you're screwed!!!!|`|8cUR80R5aa	It is a possibility. If you have sex, its always a possibility. However you could just be stressed out about it, and your period is just a bit late because of that. Try to stay calm, drink some water, wait a few days, if nothing happens look for your local planned parenthood clinic, or another free clinic, and get a blood test done there. If you don't know where one is visit their website for locations, or run a yahoo! search. Good luck|`|A2e2lklJaa	my period was 4 days late when i found out i was pregnant. i had several times of minor cramping, lasting only a few minutes, over the course of a few days.. so i thought for sure my period was coming. i would take a test honey..|`|1UpR1vSCaa	same thing happened to me  i had cramping like i was going to get my period and i was already 5 weeks pregnant best thing is ti test in the next 3 days good luck
wlAmUQe3aa	Nothing dreadful is going to happen to your bay so try not to worry.    Studies have been done which show that alcohol does not pass into breast milk in any significant amounts. Breastmilk was tested before, during, straight after and 2 hours later and there was no real difference in the amount of alcohol found. Women's bodies are amazing and when producing milk, the body takes what it needs and ignores the rest. Providing your wife isn't getting utterly pie-eyed all the time, then it's fine to have a couple of beers.    Also, obviously smoking is not good, either for your wife or the baby but it can be really hard to stop (especially if you are getting a hard time about it). The current thinking on smoking mothers is that if they REALLY need to smoke it is actually better if they breastfeed as well (obviously not at the same time) because the action of breastfeeding strengthens the baby's lungs and the breastmilk provides anti-bodies and other nutrients that counterbalance the negative effects from smoking. (a friend of mine's mother told us the only advice she'd been given about smoking around the new baby (my friend) was not to drop ash on her while she was breastfeeding - how times have changed; I don't see how anyone would even consider doing that now)    I think you need to try and work out a compromise with your wife which takes into account what is good for the baby but also what is good for her; after being pregnant for 9 months and giving birth, she may just want to get back to doing things she enjoyed before and in a lot of ways who can blame her?|`|wipJ9OE7aa	I hope that you made a mistake and meant to say that you've told her many times that she CAN'T breastfeed the baby if she smokes and drinks alcohol. What type of advice are you looking for? It's just plain wrong- not good or healthy for your child. If something happens and you child ends up in the hospital as a result of her excessive drinking then social services will definitely get involved and possibly take your child away. So, I suggest that she get it together.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	if she breast feeds the baby will get the alcohol which isn't good for the baby,   she could drop the baby if she is too drunk burn the baby by accident with the cigarrette ,|`|FmSWPS7Paa	you should tell her to bottle feed the baby and not breast feed. wont want to risks the baby;s health by giving it tobacoo and alcohol. she should quit that. has it been done throughout the preganancy?|`|3ec4c66236d45c263eb7e7fd20363059aa	You can not drink and breastfeed, and as for the smoking,since you would have to wait like 2 hours after having a cigarette before breastfeeding, she might as well not do that either. I assume she didn't drink or smoke well she was pregnant, then she should be able to quit, that's my opinion.|`|DYLEoJmWaa	You and your wife needs a seminar in regards with being a parents to your children/child. You have to warn your wife not to get involve in such vises like smoking and drinking alcohol. It does not only affect the baby's health but also the behavior or your baby by the time your baby reached the 3 year old age. May seem copy what your wife does. Detoxification can solve problem with follow up guidance from you.

fG7LmB7Kaa	Expect this first of many prenatal checkups to be excitingand long. You'll have a thorough physical, including a pelvic exam, Pap smear (unless you've recently had one) and blood tests to determine your blood type, Rh factor, and whether you're iron-deficient. You'll also be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, immunity to German measles (rubella), and ethnic-specific genetic diseases. Plus you'll need to pee into a cup (no problem with that  right?) so your urine can be tested for glucose, protein, red and white blood cells, and bacteria. One more thing: Be prepared to answer lots of questions (health histories can take a while), but more importantly, to ask some of your own (bring a list so you won't forget any).|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	expect to stay a long time...lol...seriously|`|VUss5AfAaa	ultrasond and your due date..maybe hear the heart beat.  depends how many weeks you are.|`|fipzrStFaa	WHEN YOU FIND OUT.

rHufcHwHaa	you don't have to have gotten your period to get pregnant.|`|Jswomud7aa	unfortunately yes. She can ovulate before she has her first period. If she had intercourse around that time there is a possibility of pregnancy.|`|QSodlfMraa	i think not.|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	No.  That's impossible|`|hZuq2XT9aa	I highly doubt that....if it was true then all the rapes/statutory rape's would affect economy.......!!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Yes it could happen, because you always ovulate before you get your period, so if she has sex two weeks before she would get her period, then yes- she could get pregnant.|`|p3d3E75oaa	ummm no|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No. Not unless she just happened to have sex right before she ovulated for the first time. Then it is possible.   I have read articles where girls as young as five or six years old have gotten their period.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It can happen before her first period would be about to start (the ovulation before that period) but otherwise no.    Harriet|`|XxZQ72J4aa	It's possible to get pregnant before you have your first period, because sometimes prepubescent girls will ovulate before their first.     Check this out. You might find it interesting.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_you...|`|zuOPSr5Eaa	why do you ask? are you a pervert or something?  karma will punish you...|`|lIpjuMTHaa	No, that's the body's whole point of menstruation. And why are you asking this? A girl that young should in no way be having any sexual contact with anyone.|`|e3rBPr2caa	Are you some sick pervert? unless you did something i wouldn't be worried about it...|`|6mhFHSRSaa	That's an interesting question... and one may wonder why you ask. I hope it is not because there is a little girl you know who has been subjected to sexual activity and has pregnancy to worry about, among other things.    However, to answer your question, fertility happens BEFORE menstruation in each cycle, which means that a girl is fertile several days before her first period ever starts. Some girls will start to menstruate as young as 8, others as late as 16. While, in my opinion, a young girl should never be put in a situation where sexuality and pregnancy are even a question, there are records of some very young children conceiving a child. There's even a case of a 5-year old Peruvian girl having a child herself (see Snopes link below).    There is pretty much no warning when the first menses will come. Sometimes ovulation (which comes before menstruation) is stimulated by sexual activity. There may also be a relationship between sexual abuse and earlier menstruation (see second link). Therefore, I think it is pretty safe to assume that sexual activity in a "little girl" aside from being morally reprehensible, is also potentially dangerous in terms of pregnancy risk, especially as the girl ages.    I would say no guy of any age should ever be with girls young/immature enough not to have ever menstruated, never mind laws about ages of consent. You may find yourself in legal trouble in addition to the other risks mentioned. I would steer very clear of that situation if I were you.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	noway

If I could make a couple suggestions they would be Alana Leanne (I think this flows a lot better with a longer middle name - I really like this!), Sydney Allise (uh-lease - I really think this name is beautiful and I'm not a fan of Robyn. Or Sydney Grace / Sydney Nicole would be really, really pretty), and Daniel Blake. But really, I LOVE your names.

Jswomud7aa	They mimic your smile, so the more you do it the earlier they will copy you. Mine both did about 5 weeks old.    But the gurgle baby laugh genuine smile didn't come until they were about 3 months or so.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My daughter started really smiling at 5 weeks, but I've heard of earlier!|`|rHufcHwHaa	babies smile when they have gas the first few months after birth.  Smiles become meaningful around 3-5 months.|`|FLpMShKNaa	Anywhere from a couple weeks old to a few months. My son was doing big smiles when I sang silly songs very early.

I was supposedly "smiling" when I was three days old. That's where I got my name from, haha.  According to other people on this page it was just gas, lol.  You'd have to older than I was to know what you're doing.  But the three days thing is the story my parents tell.|`|ORpbq3bAaa	my baby smiled when she was a few days old. but now shes 4 months and she is laughing out loud|`|YlyN73Jnaa	You can get infants to smile as early as 5 days old to 5 weeks old if you make a funny face up close that will bring them pleasure. Sometimes they only smile for certain people. They start to laugh at a few months old. You never know when it will happen.|`|tA7WDLm4aa	Mine was 2 months.  It's adorable, now I'm just waiting for his giggle. I know he wants to but he just hasn't done it yet.  I can't wait!!

For a little bit, I thought it was just a coincidence...and just gas...but nope, I was always able to pry one out of her...after a bunch of high pitch talking to her and smiling. My other 2 started smiling at around 6-7 weeks old. She's now 10 weeks old and coo's the most out of all my children.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter is almost 4 weeks old and she's been smiling from the day she was born. Some say it's gas but mostly it's when she's sleeping and goodness knows what she's dreaming about to make her smile so wide. But now, she actually semi smiles for example when I kiss her all over her face.It's not an all out smile, but it's pretty close.I can tell she likes it. I can't wait for her to laugh.

I think its great when girls are named unisex or male names. its so original,a dn i've never heard this one before. its gorgeous. I love it! :)|`|CvVAxqUXaa	I think that the first name Ryan for a girl is really cute.  I once knew a girl who spelled it with two n's.  That made it look more like a girls name.  As for Elizabeth, I think it is a beautiful name.  However, I probably wouldn't use it as a middle name because it is too long.  If you want other ideas about girls' names you could just search for it online.|`|fd4e10a42c86c67feb1b080c908f919aaa	I love it!  Riann or Rianne is cute to me.

XOnSRoR2aa	No. Even with the heat on full blast (which would skyrocket your parent's electricity bill) and under heaps of blankets it's incredibly unlikely you'd build up enough of a sweat to lose any weight at all. Our bodies transfer heat to objects we are in contact with - it's called conductive heat transference - and cool us down. Have you ever  noticed being a bit colder when you first get into bed? That's because your body is absorbing the coolness of the sheets and transferring a lot of its heat to them. Almost all of the heat your body generates will be absorbed by the bed. Your body will gradually adjust to the increased heat and reach an equilibrium between the heat generation of your body and the heat absorption of your bed, and you'll become comfortable. Your body will not be burning any more calories than it normally would. It's sort of like how when you jump in a pool you are freezing at first, but after a while your body temperature adjusts and you are comfortable, but in reverse. Also, you are going to be bored out of your mind.    Some people lose weight in saunas because there is nothing to absorb the heat except the towel they are wearing. The weight loss isn't permanent, though, because you are just losing water weight and it will all come back almost immediately.     No offense to Matt, but please don't take his suggestion of putting on lots of layers and running outside. That can quickly lead to heat exhaustion which can be very dangerous.     Your best bet for losing weight is to cut back on sugar and processed carbs, like white bread, waffles, muffins, pasta and the like. Have more fruit and vegetables, and drink lots of water. I like to squeeze lime or lemon juice in mine to make it taste better. Work out for at least half an hour every day. If you find something that you like doing you are more likely to stick to it. I love pilates, yoga, tennis, swimming, biking, running and just dancing like crazy to music. : )    Good luck!|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	Exercise is better and cut down on fats and sugars. Eat more raw foods. Cut back on animal protein.|`|X4U36dHzaa	well a better way is to get a couple of layers of clothes ones that will make you sweat polyester,then run around the block it's like being in a walkable sauna,that's how the jockeys do it cause they sometimes have to lose a few kilos in a day so it work an stop eating as much as you used to,like if you ate 4 times a day cut it down to three and smaller portions!  good luck!|`|fKDZlxOsaa	I guess. It's called a sauna, some gyms have them. You will lose weight, but not a lot, and not very quickly.    swimming (if you do it right) and jogging burn the most calories per minute.    Also the heating bill would be really high.    Run 20 minutes (min), 5 days a week.|`|y49j8gyAaa	it will probably be just water weight, so it will be temporary. it sounds kind of gross actually.|`|RumoQkohaa	no, loose weight by eating right and exercising regularly|`|LZqUE9w7aa	theorectically you would loose weight, but it would be miniscule amounts. water isnt as heavy as fat, and you wouldn't sweat that much. and you'd probably get out from under the blankets due to the unbearable heat and boredom.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	don't count on it.  you'll probably get rrrrrreally hot.    if you want to lose weight, just  check what you're eating.    are you eating balanced meals,  healthy foods?    are you exercising?|`|Z69OX0Gxaa	your mother is going to walk in on you and wonder what the hell you are doing.
eu6UQElYaa	People shouldn't plan their lives entirely around statistics.  If that was the case then no one in the US should get married because we have the highest divorce rate in the world.|`|RrPjG9x9aa	Everyone is different.  Waiting till your 30's to marry works for some people....others get married at 23 and stay married for life.|`|G7DlDjJhaa	If you ask me I don't think the real reason people divorce so much is because they don't take the time to make sure marriage is what they really want before they jump into it, not because they are young.    As long as you wait long enough and you are sure (which takes longer than just a few months!) that this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life, maybe you would have a better chance of having such a big commitment.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	It doesn't really make a difference, does it? But it would be best to marry no earlier than 25.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	yeah like that would happen . all the Christians would die waiting 30 years to have sex . then you also have to think about having children . i was 18 when i got married and i will be 21 this year . i have never been happier . in any marriage you will go through problems . its how you handle them that makes the difference and now days alot of people just htink divorce is the easiest way out . 20 and 30 years ago divorce was not as common because women getting GREAT jobs was not a part or society and they couldnt afford life so they had to stay with there husband even if they beat them|`|UftgUcCIaa	No. It's bad to get married when you're |`|F0d1bOxgaa	They can do this but it doesn't mean they shouldn't!

UUpsa35Daa	I think it's okay if you have a legit reason to. I don't agree with parents snooping just for the sake of snooping. But if the find something out or suspect something like your kid is smoking or having sex...snoop away.|`|4R93xF8naa	THAT'S HORRIBLE!!  give your daughters privacy, they are normal human beings like u and me, they deserve it  i understand you care for them, but the best way is by letting them have their own life and make mistakes so that they become better persons by themselves, without u being all up on their business  unless u feel like they are in bad steps or something??, but other then that... i dont think thats right.|`|fKDZlxOsaa	It's ok as long as you tell me what they say.    I'm nosy as hell too.|`|v05RzzCEaa	I think monitering what your daughters do and say every once in a while is okay.

I have a friend that Im with and it is so freakin annoying when he gets up for a sec and his mom starts IM'in me saying this like, Sydney this is Mrs.....and I don't think it is a good idea for you to be talkin about so and so.

As long as they are living in your home, you have the right to see what they are up to. if it weren't for my mother snooping in my stuff, she would have never found out her straight "A" student daughter was doing drugs and would not have sent me to a treatment center. I thank her every day, even though im 18 now and living on my own. Don't feel guilty about it, you're just being a mom.|`|AA12005593	no, that is NOT okay.  it's only okay if you have a legit reason to do that.  not just because you like to.  they will never trust you again, if they ever found out you were doing that.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	No, it's not.  It's an invasion of privacy.

I used to hate when my mom did that. She always thought I was doing something bad, it just felt like she never trusted me.

Snooping just to snoop isn't good and if your daughters find out, it could destroy the trust they have in you and it could be hard to earn it back.|`|PExOJJLgaa	no.  if you snoop, you'll always find something you don't like.  you should trust that you've raised them well enough not to get into really bad stuff.    most of the time, what you find is not really what it seems it is anyway.    if you see cigs in the draws or drugs, etc. THEN you should be worried.      you know you wouldn't have liked a mother like that when you were their age.|`|isxKjsc0aa	Do you have reason not to trust them?  If so... then I think its ok, it will only help them in the long run.  If they have earned your trust, then leave it be, they will come to you.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	No,That's wrong.If you want to know something,ask her. If you have a good enough relationship and are open minded about things you wont have to snoop. I respected my kids privacy and they respected me as a parent.|`|8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	Nope. Only time my mom did that was when she accidently found my Facebook.|`|KCgCmelkaa	If your hate your child then absolutely yes....    Seriously, the fact that you would ponder such a thing makes me want to smack you. My mom used to snoop through my things and I have never forgiven her for that. Not only will she NEVER fully trust you again, but she will never share ANYTHING with you. Teenagers don't need overprotective parents, they need freedom to make mistakes and become adults. You are just there to pick up the pieces when they try and fail...not control everything they do. If you do anything like that then your kids will ALWAYS despise you because you are showing them taht you have absolutely no respect for them whatsoever. My mother and I are friends now but after MANY, MANY years. I still don't even trust her fully and I still have a lot of anger toward her. Your daughters thoughts and relationships are personal and until she decides thats she wants to share them with you, they are none of your business. How would you like it if someone were snooping through your ****? Like it or not, you are not the most important person in her life anymore because she is learning to be independant. You need to as well, because invading her privacy and personal things makes your a ******* psycho. I know I sound angered and thats because I am. You should be ashamed of yourself. If you love her, then let her grow up or she will end up hating you for the rest of her life. What is more important to you... reading a few of her personal texts or getting to share her life experiences as her friend as she gets older. It's a no brainer. Don't be stupid.|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Well, its depends.  Im not a big texting fan, acctuly I hate texting.  But I can be really nosy.  I want to look at my sisters texts but she would get soooooo mad!!!  But I think its ok, it shows you care and dont want them to get hurt or something.  Just dont read ones that she might get mad at you for, (if she finds out)  But dont read a lot of them.  Because it is personal stuff in there!|`|G7DlDjJhaa	No offense, but think about how you would like it if your mother went through all your stuff secretly?  Do you not trust her? What other reason would you need to go through her stuff?    Maybe you and your daughter dont have as good of a relationship as my mom and I have (and believe me she can be strict, too), but if i really need to tell her about something, I tell her. She doesn't even have to go through my personal stuff to know what i'm up to. There are other ways you can tell what your daughter has been doing if that is what you're really worried about.    Ex, if you think she has had sex, talk to her about it or take her to the doctor.  If you think she's on drugs, pay attention to her behavior closer, it's not hard to tell whose on drugs and who isn't.  If you think she's smoking, SMELL HER!|`|XQexuxy4aa	no no no ... NOT OKAY .. dunn invade privacy like that .. if she EVER finds out she will hate u .. when shez ready to talk to u she will .... AHHHHHHH ... are u crazzy .. DO NOT SNOOPP|`|NW3tKobLaa	let's put it this way...  if you sneak and suspect that they might be doing something wrong,  you don't trust your parenting skills and the way you raised them  not trying to offend anyone,  it's just the way i see it
VHHis05Naa	I do not hit my child.  She is extremely well-behaved and is a very happy kid.  We do time outs and I talk to her in such a way that gives her choices.  A choice to behave or a choice to go to time out.  To avoid meltdowns and misbehavior, she also gets choices again.  Which shirt would you like to wear?  I also talk to her matter-of-factly in a firm voice.  We will be leaving in ten minutes.  We will set a timer for bedtime and she jumps up and goes straight to bed without issue.  So far, these things have worked for us.      I was abused as a child and cannot raise a hand to her.  My husband feels the same way I do and we're committed to being consistent, firm, and loving with her so that she continues to respect us as her parents and behave.  So far, she's a pleasure.  We get compliments from strangers on how wonderful she is.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	It's ok to spank when nothing else has worked.  A swat on the backside never killed anyone.  however, that's all.  Punishment if consistent and age-appropriate is always the better way to go.|`|hYohgOcAaa	dont hit a child its not like it knows much anyways..its just a kid, dont be to a mad women...give advice to kids and talk to them...when u were younger did u like getting hit...  DO U WANT UR KIDS TO LOOK AT U AS BULLY AND BE SCARED OF YOU EVERY TIME U WALK IN A ROOM ...MOMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE KIND, UNDERSTANDING   JUST GIVE A LITTLE DISCIPLINE AND ULL BE FINE|`|AA12221392	I have spanked all my kids , I do not like belts at all. I was spanked once in awhile as a kid also.     I don't think spankings are the answer all the time, but when it it warrents it yup, give a good swat on the behind.    I make my kids stand in the corner alot too (they are a little big for this now) we take things away from them more now and we also make them write essays for bad behavior, on why they did it , what can they change about it, and what they learned. 1000 word essays. They hate it|`|r07BwhO1aa	I think spanking is an effective tool in raising a child.  It should never be confused with abuse.    I think it is fine to spank your children, as long as you do it for the right reasons.  IE child broke a plate while cleaning the table WRONG child was blatantly disrespectful RIGHT    Any good parent who spanks should know when and how to use it.  It is a tool just like a hammer is.  Do you use a hammer to fix a broken glass?  NO, just like spanking should not be used for small things.    Children (I know this will get tons of thumbs down but it must be said) are like puppies, you have to train the puppy to not bite, pee in the house, and to obey, just like you have to train children.  Once the child knows the right and wrong way of doing things you don't have to spank any more or a least not as often.|`|5D0KuT74aa	yes  not hard, you CAN use a paddle on a bare bottom if the incedent was very serious, like stealing, or vandalism, but for not so serious things, like swearing or lying (bad examples, but cant think of anything else) then a few smacks on the bottom with your hand should doif it doesn't work, then you need to find a new method, spanking works on some kids, but not on others|`|p3d3E75oaa	I will hit them on their hands when their like 3/4 yrs but when they got older straight up punishment, my kids hate it lol|`|cUCtK4zCaa	As a Mom i think its more than ok to spank a child. But it should always be done in a very simple controlled manner never spank out of anger or even punish a child when angry. This could lead to abuse.  send them to there room and thin about what would the crime sort to Speak was and how many times they have been told or what not and always always be mind full of the child's age and ability to understand there actions..     I would never spank a child under 1 yr of age. But a small hand tap over 1 will not harm them if done simple and for the right reasons.  My Son loved the stove at 1 many times i would move him away and tell him NO after a few times i would tap his little hand this would break my heart but  i new in a long run it would work and he would leave it alone and after a few days/ taps he did. He is know 3 and has no interest in my stove at all..    Good luck   Tonya|`|xPR7g0wFaa	I have always felt this way.(Im not saying its right or wrong but this works for my kids). I NEVER hit or spanked my kids.  When I do something wrong or make a mistake,no one hits me or causes me physical pain.We as parents are to teach our kids and protect them.Use time out or take something away.Why is it ok for Dad to spill milk but yet Billy gets spanked for doing the same thing.When kids are hurting or sick we do things to make them feel better and stop the pain.Why inflict pain when there are other ways of teaching and scolding them.Like I said, Im not trying to make anyone mad or upset but this is what I do with my children.|`|VZaqk5CYaa	everyone is different, I was spanked as a child, and learned from it. i didnt act out in high school. i was my moms best teen through highschool.   I have 2 little girls, and they get spanked now and then. They dont like to listen to and back talk at times. but mainly get a swat for lieing to me. and my older daughter learnes from it. but it doesnt faze my youngest, and they are only about a year apart, so its not the age difference my older learned from it a long time ago, and doesnt get spanks as often.  I do not use it as the only punishment. they get toys taken away, and no tv for the day. and time out.     there really is no right and wrong. every child is different and all parents are too.|`|4ENjqY1Eaa	Yep, but gently and not with their hands. The discipline your mom used is ok too.|`|EtTddxAqaa	NO It is never ok to hit/spank your child.  I mean spanking is different than hitting.  spanking is a pat on the booty to get the kids attention and for some children it does work and for others it does not.  I mostly try to use the time-out chair as much as i can. I do not SMACK OR HIT MY KIDS. but i do spank them once or twice if they are making me go nuts. haha. well i hope i helped you  carrie?

r07BwhO1aa	My daughter has this Hanna Montana thing that hangs in her door and sings when you walk through it!!    If I hear Best of Both Worlds one time I am going to go postal!!!  LOL|`|prqrQcd1aa	The musical toys that seem to go off when you are walking slowly through the room trying to cover up a sleeping baby, and it wakes her up lol.    Funny as it sounds, PLAY DOUGH.. i got the 3 and 7 year old's it for christmas in a big tub with all kinds of extra things for them to do with it, they are only allowed to play in the kitchen, it keeps them busy for HOURS, and it's not that hard to clean up off of the floor in the kitchen!|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	finger paint, and play doh|`|QDfX8nacaa	Soccer ball !!!!!!    He broke every single thing in our home|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	Pixo's.  It was one thing my son asked for at christmastime, so "Santa" brought him pixos.

Once they are gone, they will be gone forever :).|`|ylAILdcUaa	my sons only7 and  ahalf months so he doesnt want to much stuff :p but my two year old really wanted this doll that talks. and now all day i have to listen to "I wuv u mommy! waaawawwwawawawawwa momma!" that thing is sooooooo annoying! but she loves it XD  and my fav would be a portable DVD player for long car trips, just pop in Cars and we're good. :D|`|n2O0NwR6aa	My daughter had a favorite doll - a "water baby."  One day as we were going to the store, I told her she really ought to leave it in the car, because she might lose it.  Oh no, she said, I wont!  On the way back home, of course, she realized it was missing.  We went back to the store and looked around, asked the manager if anyone had turned it in, but no luck.  My daughter was devastated.      This was the perfect opportunity, I thought, to teach her some valuable lessons; about responsibility, taking care of your belongings, and that if you're careless and lose or break something, you'll have to go without.      But I wussed out big time.  I hated to see her so heartbroken - so I got her a new one!  I wish I'd stuck to my guns and let her suffer, so that she could've learned from the experience.  But oh well, I guess I'm just a big wimp!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Wish I hadn't:  Moonsand.   Gawd that crap gets EVERYWHERE.  It get's in their hair, it gets in their clothes, it gets really deep into the carpet (somehow it manages that even when I make them take it outside to play).    I really, really hate that crap.    Favorite thing: Legos.  They spend HOURS playing with legos.   And they're usually quiet when they are playing with them.   Best Christmas gift EVER!|`|iN0cyZoTaa	I bought my grandson this Pokemon Battle Dome thing.  It was about $60.  It's a cheap plastic piece of junk.  He never plays with it. It's just taking up much needed space.   Good gift was the Legos.  He likes those. Or I just let him use my computer for games.  He's five and has a blast with that.|`|cUCtK4zCaa	Oh yes don't we all have an item we wished we could take back..Lil    I got my Son a nice set of  Lego's..You only have to step on them one time to know to never o that again and be sure at all cost to prevent it..    Good Luck   Tonya|`|tDaU7eYXaa	Well, I'm not a parent, I'm a kid. I wish though that they hadn't bought me an XBOx. Now, I'm addicted. It's real. It hooks you in and you do whatever you can to play. I used to be a good, sociable kid. Then I stopped talking to people. I became shy. I wish I could go to one of those self esteem karate things now.... It totally ruined my life, kinda. I guess it formed my personality. I stopped now, but I still play a bit every once and a while. Because video games are mostly for guy, and I'm a girl, I can understand what the guys are saying and I find it fun to hang with them. So I'm not totally part of one group. I guess it's just teenage crap.    I love the little tiny cheap trinkets. Like mood rings. Not old yet.... only $4. And puzzle rings. Even though their frustating. And rubix cubes rock
Ki0uUdwOaa	Definitely yelling to much as well.  It can become a really bad habit, and I absolutely feel guilty when I assume something and yell.  The other day my son was playing his ds, and I told him he could not play it until he was finished eating.  I heard the game running in another room and assumed he could not have ate the meal within that short of time, and so I yelled "I told you no game until you finished dinner".....He said "mom I did".  I checked and he did, then I felt like such a crappy mother for yelling instead of checking first.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I get frustrated after i've said something for the 5th time with my 3 year old and then look at her and tell her.. "GO CLEAN YOUR ROOM" she gets so scared that she runs to clean that room lol, i don't know if that is such a bad thing though.  On the other hand with my 7 year old after i've said something for about the 100th time and she still isn't doing as she is told (i'm talking about at school here) i yell at her and send her to the corner.. and it still doesn't sink into her head most of the time.. for more than a couple of days. I try talking to her, but after talking about the same thing so many times, there comes a point where you just don't want to talk about it anymore, and so you start to yell about it, and that doesn't solve anything either. So you just tell her that she knows what she did was wrong and you don't say anything, but you send her to her room or to the corner and you tell her NO TV, and she cries and cries and cries. Then you feel bad and you give her an extra treat the next time she does good in school... but she only uses that "pitty" to in turn walk all over you in some other way...   So i guess with her, it would be not giving her that extra treat, just what she has earned, even if i feel bad.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Patience for sure.  I definately yell more than I'd like too.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	I also yell too much.|`|RVeLHqe9aa	im too easy on my two year old sometimes.  I try to justify it by saying "im a single dad im allowed to spoil him some"  And I do only spoil him a little but  every so often I spoil too much.... id change that..... maybe....lol|`|tDaU7eYXaa	I am not a parent, but in the future I will....    need to work on my flexibility and schedule. Being a parent I know will be hard. Sometimes, you would run out of time for yourself. So I will pledge that I WILL make time for a little relaxation. With this session of peace, I am hoping to become more patient and possibly less stressed. But ya... patience. I just don't get how some parents just let their kids run around screaming and spoil their kids. Don't they ever get annoyed?!!!??? I guess they have too much patience. SERIOUSLY!!!!!|`|r07BwhO1aa	Honestly I don't know if there is anything I would change.  My daughter is a well adjusted, well behaved, child, who is a year a head in school. I am not saying I have all the answers but so far this parenting thing is much easier than I heard or thought it would be.  I can't take all the credit she has been a really easy kid compared to people I know and stories I hear on here.       If I had to pick one thing I would say that I do pressure her to do well in school.  I am kinda strict when it comes to things like talking back and whining.    To be fair I will call her out here and type exactly what she says:    Me: What would you change about mommy?    Brianna:  I can't think when I have to pee, you called me on the way to the bathroom.    Me: Okay silly go pee.    Brianna: Okay let me think, I would change the way you talk when you are mad, you use your hands a lot like you are a puppet master.    Me: Anything else?    Brianna: Oh yea, how you give me a creepy look when you think I am doing something bad even if I am really not.    Me: Anything else?    Brianna: Ummm I should always sleep with you if I have a bad dream.    Me: (I did not type anything)    Brianna: Put it!!    Me:  Anything else?    Brianna: You should always make me eggs in a basket.    Me: Is that all?    Brianna: Yup.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Well my kids are grown.  I don't know what I would change...our life hasn't been normal.  My son was in a car accident and was in a coma for 10 weeks and then paralyzed....that was when he was 7.  then he spent 10 years in and out of hospitals...sometimes 11 times a year....and over 100 surgeries.   I couldn't be there for all my kids...so my husband took care of the other boys while I was at the hospital most of time.      I guess if I could change things or my parenting in any way...it would be to let go a little more...and tell Jerry...YOU come handle the doctors and let me go to ball games and have some relaxation.  Not to say he wasn't there....don't get me wrong.  Jerry worked and was at the hospital at night...but we tried to give the others as much a normal life as possible.  It is a situation no one should ever go through...and we made choices we thought was right and I wish they were different.    I guess nothing would be ok....it was all screwed up. I lacked patience and tolerance due to a lot of stress and just being tired going to college and sitting at the hospital all day.....and worrying about his monthly life and death situations....we just never knew if he would make it.      despite all this they all turned out to be GREAT men...so I guess we did right.|`|je3xYc4laa	i feel like i yell to much :/|`|cLfIJgudaa	definately more patience.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	Even though I'm a stay at home mom, I wish I had more energy to do stuff with my daughter.
ZSSUfSXwaa	Yes it's totally different! Because when it's somebody elses you keep thinking that your child would never do this or that or the other LOL and it annoys you! It annoys me!!   However MY children Dont annoy me, I love them to pieces and I enjoy them! I think they're the funniest, cutest, smartest,better behaved-well most of the time anyways ;P kids of the whole world! LOL   Dont worry you'll say the same thing about your son :)|`|xp0BnsD0aa	Correct!  You will have an inbuilt ability to adore all of your childrens' quirks, to stop you from throwing them from the nest!    I can't stand the sound of toddlers squealing in a supermarket but love my own!|`|DLDweOcYaa	Other kids don't really annoy me unless they really are terrors!    PS...love your profile pic BTW|`|p3d3E75oaa	no its different cause other kids aggravate me too sometimes|`|cG80UU5Waa	Yeah it is. I really don't like kids, and I especially don't like babies. But I absolutely adore my daughter!|`|vJEatJFPaa	Yes. Before Toddlers used to annoy me but now I love children all ages..! I think this happens because you gain a lot of patience after you care for your child.|`|dgRTkccBaa	It is different.  Your own kids will get on your nerves at time, too but since they're your own kids and you love them it's not the same.  Other people's kids bug me and when they act up i just want them to go away, but I'm much more patient with my own children.|`|b5JnSBstaa	Yes, so true. I really can't stand other people's children. They annoy the heck out of me.  But, I love my son more than anything. He's 4 months now.|`|GNtsdk4saa	Yes, completely different.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	yes it is very different.  I don't know why but its true.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	oh totally. I used to hate the sound of other babies crying or squealing. i remember when my neice would start squealing in her high pitched squeal I would feel very stressed and was always amazed her mother could go right on talking like she wasnt even hearing it. After having my baby I relize why. my daughters crying dosnt bother me much. Dont get me wrong I hate it when she crys but its definatly easier to deal with then another childs crying. You love them so much you dont mind that they are screaming in your ear.   Also their poop dosnt smell so bad when they are your own baby. haha
zXCFGPhOaa	My kids were all named after a family member of some sort from my husband or my side.   Jack Christopher- My husbands name is Christopher. His dad name is Jack.  Emma Claire- My best friends name was Claire, my moms name was Emma. Claire passed away right before Emma was born, we had been friends since we were babies. My mom passed away when emma was two. She has a very meaningful name.  Ryan David- My dads name is David, Christophers brothers name is Ryan.  Hannah Mackenzie- My great grandpas name is Mackey David, My dad was David Mackey, my dad always hated Mackey as a middle name, and wouldn't let me name my sons that, so we used Mackenzie as Hannahs Middle name :D Its cuter! Hannah was just a beautiful name my husband liked.  Sarah Michele- My middle name is Michele. Sarah was picked out by Emma, she named all her dolls Sarah when she was little.     And the future baby: Ava Grace, Grace was my mother in laws name. No one has been named after her, so we decided to give her a bit of attention :D poor lady.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	My daughters middle name is my sisters first name.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter's middle name is my maternal grandmother's name|`|rHufcHwHaa	I plan on giving my daughter my mom's name as her middle name.  I like the idea of naming kids after relatives, but in the case of a brother, I would only use his name as a middle name instead of a first name.  I wouldn't want to take away the opportunity for him to name his sons after himself, if he wanted to do that.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	My two grandfathers were both called Thomas so that's my son's middle name.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	I am... i am naming my first born boy after my hubby older brother, that died when he was 12|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	I decided to change our sons middle name the month before he was born.  His middle name is now after his great-grandpa's first name, and grandpa's middle name.    I like the name Justin|`|AA10876072	Absolutely.  It's your heritage.    We've kept a boys name going for 4 generations.    It's being proud of your family.      Simply being the fact that Justin is a sweet, nice person is a very good reason to name your child after him.    What an honor for your brother.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I used my mom's middle name for my son's middle name. My husband picked his first name.|`|MW18liqTaa	Yes. My daughter is named after my husband's late grandmother.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	yeah, my daughters name is allison grace, after each of my grandmothers.
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I like that you left the room..  I, like you, never comment on the Girl's boyfriends. If you like the bf or gf never ever say that you do. If you do, they will break up within a couple of weeks. If you say you don't like them, they tend to defend.  Goes to show when you live right, things workout fine.  It will be interesting to see how she tries to get back in... Let me know.|`|tbpNk6rBaa	No, your not because everyone really has their own opinions, and if you didn't like her, hey, you didn't like her.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Lol no that's not bad.  I find it funny.    I think my mom would do the same if I were to break up with my boyfriend.  But I love him :]|`|p3d3E75oaa	No your just a mom I would do the same thing!!|`|eApDjMvWaa	Of course your not a bad Mom!!   You probably have a better sense as to who is a right fit for him than he does!!   99% of the time relationships at that age won't last for very long, so remember to be as supportive as you can. There is no pain greater than a broken heart, no matter what age so let him know that you totally get what he's going thru and it too shall pass...|`|NSXGQBkAaa	Nope. You didn't like her, so naturally you would be happy that your own son broke up with her.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	Nope, you're allowed to have an opinion on your son's girlfriends.  xD|`|cQSojmCJaa	well depends. if shes a nice girl and youre just jealous, thats mean but if shes that type that walks around in a bra and a mini skirt and smokes, drinks and talks about nasty stuff, i would be happy to have her out of the way|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	you're a jerk but dont let your son know it|`|XqlO0CKNaa	well moms are usually right when a person is not good to be around. i think you should trust your instinct|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Ha!  Well if she got off bad on you, Its fine!|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	No...as long as you do it in private and focus on the needs of your son and not the breakup, then you are not a bad Mom.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Nah, if you would have started your party in front of him that would have mean. But, you had the sense to leave the room before showing your happiness and, hopefully, you are being supportive of your son while he gets over this relationship.|`|fKDZlxOsaa	hell no. you sound like a cool @$$ mom.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	Okay, jumping up and down was not really called for.. but it's okay that your happy he broke up with her. If you didn't like her, you didn't like her.    Just let your son know that you'll always be there for him and there are more fishes in the sea.     Don't be all in his face screaming "YAY!!!!!"|`|AA12005593	lol, no that doesn't mean your a bad mom.  when my older brother broke up with his girlfriend my whole family jumped up and down. hahh, we realllly didn't like her.
agfiNdLraa	Thats me shes talking about ^ ^ hehe!!! Im 9DPO and i got my BFP today and have all the same things your talking about. my breasts are usually so sore by now but there not hardley at all!!!! you def sound pregnant to me!!! (because i am) hehe good luck girl!  I used the Digital clearblue and frist response digital (yes or no)|`|ihBFGugIaa	I just got an email from from a friend here on Yahoo Answers, and her and I have both been experiencing the exact same things as you are.  She was 9dpo and took a hpt today and got her BFP.........  so, you are at the exact same point she is at, and she tested. I have two more days until I reach my 9dpo.  We will see, but I think you should test.  Good Luck
VVV7DSITaa	Yes. Very cute. I'm an Emily, so I'm partial ;)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yes I do.  One of my sons is named Thomas Brian|`|CMuL7XpKaa	too cute|`|Lj8wjxAXaa	Emilys are smart.  Brians are dudes.  Chase is also a dude/bro.|`|c37428f3fbea3315c20ba2ba639993b2aa	yes i like them....|`|doLyOac0aa	Yes, but i am not keen on Chase|`|1xZ3lqSGaa	yes|`|SCc6f3Uraa	Yes, very nice names|`|yCyw4RlQaa	Emily is way to popular|`|mJMsiHNPaa	yes|`|hVY2AWEbaa	Love them . Chase Alexander will grow up to be a charming little man |`|5FfQkPQ2aa	yes, sounds like very solid names!|`|6s2yowRdaa	i think|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	yes|`|rXEVEfqHaa	Yes I love them!|`|ijCLcCl6aa	i absolutely love emily sara and the boys' names are very cute too|`|5cnnuRJjaa	Yes.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I love the name Emily! Sara is just okay. I do not care for Brian Thomas, but I LOVE Chase Alexander!
c8syvWqlaa	OMG before i answer i have to say if i were in your shoes i would be going crazy!!yes, something like that has been similair...i had a friend and they would almost never leacve. I would say the best thing to do is talk to your dad and any siblings you have and think of a polite way to tell your mom that you would like her friend to come over less....good luck!!!!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Woah, that sounds a pain in the neck.  Tell your mom, you want to speak to her alone.  Or you want a family meeting, with just family.  Or ask your mom, can you have some mom daughter time alone, someday. Even if you have to say it infront of them. Might give them the hint.  Tell your mom you miss spending time with her.  Kinda bring it up likes, oh one of my friends was telling me she has a great day out with her mom. Then say, its a shame we never do that.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	I'd tell them you have some relatives coming in to visit. Or that youy all are going out of town. And put a lock on your door
MigBOiUPaa	omg i kno i hate tht!!|`|v05RzzCEaa	Ugh i hate when people do that! I just try to ignore it, or I make sure i have nothing on my face!!|`|oEDGN3YJaa	they're bored|`|QGkBZFqWaa	The place where your p33n was supposed to be.|`|AA12169920	Because you've got a booger hanging out off your nose?|`|7MKmxkjlaa	i hate that ... especially when your a girl and they look at your boobs !!  im like .. Oh hi im up here !!
eu6UQElYaa	Some women just don't feel their babies move as early as other's do.  That's perfectly normal.   Yes usually women with subsequent pregnancies usually feel them early, but if you have a history of not feeling them move early then it's normal for you and probably nothing to worry about.   A lot of things can factor into not feeling the baby move early.  One of those things is just being preoccupied with other things and with 4 kids I imagine you have plenty other things to keep your mind on during the day.   Try not to worry.  You may just be one of those people that doesn't feel their babies unti laround week 25.    That's ok.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I didn't feel my daughter move until I was 24 weeks pregnant.    Good Luck :)|`|1xZ3lqSGaa	I haven't/ Go to the doctor they say it the baby doesn't move when you are on your right side. Try that first.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	Some babies are more active than others. Also (not saying that you are overweight) but if you are then that would also make the movements less noticeable. I wouldn't worry as long as the u/s shows that the baby is healthy and growing normal. If you really want him/her to move more then drink lots of cold liquids and lie down. That usually gets the little one stirred up!|`|1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	i felt my son at 14 weeks, but never felt my daughter move until about 24-25 weeks, she had me really worried, but as soon as i started feeling her move that was it, i was getting kicked 2 bits hehe, good luck|`|4FAcbtskaa	Seriously does the baby even form little stump legs by 20 weeks? I wouldn't worry too much, my mother didn't feel me move until around 22-26 weeks.|`|n2cRIGZUaa	Don't worry if some days you don't feel the baby move I have a 6month old and their were times i didn't feel him move he only really moved when I ate lol...but things are probably alright if this is your first baby that happens alot You probably won't feel your baby kick until sometime between 16 and 22 weeks, even though he started moving at 7 or 8 weeks you just have a relaxed baby!|`|OJFz0LBZaa	this is my 3rd pregnancy and this time around i felt little flutters around 14 weeks but no strong movements till week 22, every baby is different and they say the more kids you have the earlier you feel movement but i don't believe that, as long a your scans are ok i wouldn't worry|`|8uiH6iRbaa	hey my friend had that problem and it was because she had loads of water so the baby was well cushioned     don't worry all will be fine if your ever unsure always see your GP    but im sure u will feel baby soon !|`|aLkCxq5aaa	Try not to worry if the scans are fine.  Easier said than done I know.  I'm currently 37 weeks with my 3rd pregnancy and was expecting to feel the baby move earlier because I'd read everywhere that you feel movements earlier with subsequent babies, but it wasn't until I was 19 weeks that I felt the first flutters.  Even then I didn't feel them everyday until maybe a week or so later.  Then they didn't stop!!  Also, your baby could be lying so that his limbs are facing your back so you won't feel movements as well.  Good Luck! x|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,  its normal to feel them until later weeks.    even 24 weeks +  baby may be in different position.    god bless x everything is fine
AA10916001	I would pick either Alexander or Trey as I think it always sounds  better when a first and middle name have a different number of syllables each.    I'd steer clear of James even though the syllables are different because I hate the "cutsey-ness" of having them start with the same letter....      JMHO.|`|VGy0iFMAaa	Jordan Alexander|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Jordan Michael !|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	i like jordan alexander..    but also maybe,,,, jordan isaiah|`|HZubplhvaa	Jordan Michael|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I like either alexander or trey|`|mFAJG2E8aa	Tyler     Jordan Atreyu  Jordan Mikah  Jordan Mason  Jordan Kyler  Jordan Noah  Jordan Sebastian  Jordan Cole  Jordan Wesley  Jordan Chandler  Jordan Kaden  Jordan Lukas/Lucas  Jordan Jonah  Jordan James  Jordan Lucian  Jordan Daniel  Jordan Rylan  Jordan Chase  Jordan Luke  Jordan Austin  Jordan Connor  Jordan William  Jordan Gage  Jordan Kenley  Jordan Kennedy  Jordan Benjamin  Jordan Thomas    Good luck, hope I helped dear. :]|`|RvJElelaaa	alexander?|`|dZLku4jaaa	jordan tyler defiantly that's SO cutee  :)  good luck !|`|a1ymHaWAaa	i like alexander|`|Hupx8wr0aa	i like jordan alexander and jordan trey.  you could do james if you like the nickname "jay jay".|`|AA11490722	i like jordan alexander|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	Jordan Tyler|`|nYqtw9DWaa	micheal or alexander  =D|`|d3BZlRyhaa	Jordan Tyler sounds really cool! :)|`|mJMsiHNPaa	alex|`|yCyw4RlQaa	Jordan Micheal|`|DtIcDLTcaa	jordan alexader sounds best   jordan james can be called jj  jordam trey can be called jt|`|T6nmD3X9aa	I think all of them are great except Tyler and Trey for the middle name!    I think I like Jordan Alexander the best, sounds professional and sweet at the same time    Jordan James sounds cool too, sounds like a funky guy people love to be around! He could go by JJ if he wanted to when he is older!    congrats & good luck|`|AA12133308	Jordan Michael!, it's sounds awesome, only the opposite way lol|`|dKMpztcJaa	I like Jordan Alexander and Jordan james|`|PqlVHDnGaa	Jordan Alexander is cute  but dont do James, too much of an alliteration|`|9YvMgBQlaa	definately not james    i like alexander or tyler..definately|`|kdN0iRdtaa	alexander  tyler|`|rXEVEfqHaa	Jordan Trey  Or   Jordan Alexander|`|a1cMDuDsaa	Jordan Alexander is the best.    -Jordan Michael just sounds backwards to everyone because of the famous athlete, Michael Jordan.    -Jordan James is too much for one name. Yuck.    -Jordan Tyler and Jordan Trey come in as a tie for second in my opinion. It just depends on how it flows with your last name.     Good luck and congrats!|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Jordan Alexander|`|cKFqN4tpaa	Jordan Alexander|`|d6ANFdZ8aa	Jordan Tyler.. cool!|`|wBpennsMaa	Jordan Thomas|`|fhxeWNsDaa	I like Jordan Alexander|`|Fr24fQRGaa	jordan alexander & jordan michael are great =]|`|l1wCobnxaa	Off the list I like Alexander the best.

Sounds classy.|`|l53naNXyaa	Jordan Michael or Jordan James sound the best to me|`|9e04e3c3db1f37b3ceaad57d7f0ee5d6aa	i think jordan michael sounds best. second choice would be jordan alexander second. none of them would be awful!|`|2SPeCGmkaa	jordan alexander sounds cute for a lil boy but sophiscated for a young man|`|ZCwbHHC6aa	jordan tyler |`|WIguyGcZaa	I'd go with Jordan Alexander or Jordan Trey because they sound classy and not many boys have classy middle names:)|`|vyHe3Lfdaa	Michael, it's my middle name.    = P
S4z7mefcaa	Trolling much??  How about Skank after her mother?|`|Yz1pzloSaa	As soon as I read the title, I knew this was a stupid joke.    Anyway, Irish and Cherry are the best.|`|doLyOac0aa	Chavtastic! LMAO.|`|Kf9SoNmoaa	lol if this is a joke it's REALLY funny.     I like Pee Pee- in my culture, that means, a yellowish colored body fluid.|`|6TdlNfgeaa	Skank and Burrito are my favorites.|`|DZJsQFGAaa	Is this a joke????????  Well, let's see  Puppy, I really like puppies  Chocolate is good too|`|d3BZlRyhaa	omg. seriously?|`|hImPK5peaa	I say Itty Bitty Two-Shoes, it just rolls off the tounge nicely,LOL!!!|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Call her this "My mom has stupid ideas for names and belongs under a bridge where all her little pals are"|`|AA11490722	definately dickers knickers- such a beautiful name for a beautiful child|`|0ljM5Ye7aa	SKANK!!!!! =D|`|QmPuip7Raa	You should name it Pee Pee!

Second, Cherry is the only name on your list I really like. I've heard of women and girls named Cherry before, but I honestly think your kid would die of shame before third grade if you gave her any of the other names on your list. You're not a celebrity, are you?|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	What kind of puppy are you getting?|`|2SPeCGmkaa	omg!!!! are you serious????  come on...get real names...  thats an embarrassment to you and your daughter!!!  be real...think about how much she will hate you for naming her those supid names|`|QlQiV100aa	Try  Isabella or Bella, It Means Beautiful in Italian.  Hope It Helps.. And Skank.. Your child would come home crying!!|`|PGUAzLclaa	You know, those are all objects names. You should try Grace or Joy or maybe Bella for a girl's name. For a boy's name you could try Daniel or David or maybe even Harrison. Hope I helped! Good luck! Bye!
IjcdwJiMaa	if u r unhappy then u need 2 do something about it! its not fare 2 u or ur baby 2 not be happy...i left my ex b/c we were just 2 different, sad 2 say but we get along fine now & we r friend for the sake of our son...ive dated a little, but it is hard, i will admit that, but all i can do is try. the most important thing 2 me is my son..if any1 i date has a problem with him they r done, that is my biggest worry that the choice i make in dating may affect him, but im not afraid of being alone cz i don't think i will be, yes ur body is different after a baby but the body is not what u wanna use 2 get a man 2 love u, if they r the ONE 4 u then that wont even matter, im sure u r a nice looking person, just have a little confidence in ur self, it will go along way!! just know that u r worth it, & so is ur baby! love will find u some day, and till then u have the best love of all from ur baby!! xx best 2 u hun, u r not alone!!|`|xlhjSDeiaa	Weather your gonna be alone forever or not GET OUTTA THAT REALATIONSHIP ASAP BEFORE THINGS GET WORSE! Dont worry u WONT be alone forever.    Maybe wait a few months then find a babysitter and go out for the night and find someone that will treat you great!    Good luck :):)|`|3X0Lsk5caa	Leave him! You will be so much happier, and you will not be alone forever! I had twin sons (they are 3 1/2 now) with a good guy, but unfortunately he worked ALL the time and I had to move closer to my family because I needed help with the twins. I didn't date much (by MY choice), but I was surprised at the number of guys that had NO problem dating a single mom. Eventually I fell in love again, and got pregnant about a year into the relationship. Well, he cheated on me. So here I go again. I am 36 weeks pregnant and guys STILL ask me out all the time lol. I think I'm done dating forever, though lol. You will NOT be alone forever. If your EX plays a part in the child's life, you will still be able to get out once in a while and have fun. It's his child, too, and he should help you out and make sure you get a break every now and then. It's stupid to stay with someone who treats you badly. Trust me! You will feel a million times better when you get rid of him. And you will find love again! You'll have guys beating down your door to spend time with you and your beautiful daughter! Good luck!|`|7Mhju1mEaa	hi i am in the exact same position   i want to leave my bf  && it makes it allot harder if you have a child together  but i want my son to grow up with his father   i want the 'happy family'    i do love my bf but most of the time i cannot stand him  and he is very lazy with our 21month old son  which causes allot of fights    but u are worried that you will never find love again  im sure you will  how old are you?  im 21 so all the guys around my age are still partyin and want lives not kids    but i think as we get older we will find someone,OF course!!    i know a few guys that are family friends around 23-25  and they have gf's that already had kids.    but they were M.I.L.F    maybe if you feel better about urself ?  go to the gym  get the m.i.l.f out    but of course u want someone who loves u 4 U    ok this is getting toooooo long    but u will be fine!!!!    i asked the same Q on here..allot of people called me weak  and to leave my bf so my son and i will be happy  than be miserbale for the rest of out lives    depends on if you think ur relationship will get better in time.|`|ssJEH5ESaa	You won't be alone forever.     I think it's something our idiot partners can hold over us once we have a child with them. We spend so little time being a normal human being, our body has changed so much, and we're just unsure of ourselves. It definitely makes it harder to leave.     It's honestly not that bad though.     I left my daughter's father in March 08. It had been something I had needed to do LONG before that, but that's when I finally got the strength to leave.     My daughter was about 2 3/4 at the time.     At the end of April, I met someone. I certainly wasn't looking for anyone, but I met him, and we just got along fantastically. Admittedly, it was online. Like I said, I wasn't looking for anyone... it wasn't on a dating site or anything, just in a chat room. We got talking, and eventually, at the end of June, we met face-to-face.     At present, I'm living with him.     He's amazing. He doesn't care that I'm overweight, that my skin sags, that my stomach is covered in stretchmarks. He is beautiful and has an incredible body.     He's a better father to my daughter than her own father is (or was), and I think he actually quite likes the idea of being her father figure from now on.     Things have gone so well, we've been together 7 months now, and not had 1 single fight.     One thing to look for though, is someone who is going to suit your lifestyle. A party boy will not be your thing. It's hard to be with someone who has a busy work schedule, or who likes to go out a lot... or is a social butterfly. Why? Because you'll be unable to participate in these things.     My partner is very much a homebody. He has 1 close friend, and otherwise just occasionally hangs out with his workmates.     He enjoys being at home, and is quite happy to spend a weekend at the shops with my daughter and I, or laying in bed watching movies together, or whatever.     He would definitely not suit me if all he ever did was go out and party... it just doesn't suit a mother.     I'm not attractive or thin either btw... I'm overweight, I'm short, I've got some fat on me. I've got cellulite and stretchmarks... and yet, I still catch him checking me out all the time, and he loves me to bits.     Seriously, it's not as bad as you think it's going to be.    Good luck!|`|AA11684972	First, have you put serious time and effort into trying to make it work? Sit back and think about that one. My Mom divorced my Dad and her big regret is she didn't try hard enough to fix things. Noone is perfect when it comes to a relationship. If its truly time to move on, then do it without worrying what the future will bring. Some women find love again. Some don't. Worrying about it will only stress you out. The sooner you are happy, the sooner you'll not worry about a guy. And when you aren't looking, you naturally tend to find things...or be found. So chin up!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I was a single parent when I had my daughter until she was 2. And honestly I didn't have time to date, I either worked or spent time with her, which I loved.   I loved the break I took from the dating world, it gave me a sense of who I was and what I'm looking for. I'm now engaged with 2 children. He loves my daughter as his own.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Well hun you know my story..... yes I am extremely scared. But like everyone has already said, you can't stay in a relationship just cos of Alissa, it's not fair on any of you, especially her. You won't be lonely forever, you will find someone :) *hugs*.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	If you are not happy leave him. You can't be miserable for the sake of the child. It isn't fair to either of you.    My son was 2 when I met my now husband. He always said he wouldn't date a woman that already had kids but he fell in love with BOTH of us. 5 years later he adopted him.    Love IS out there. It takes patience.|`|UinOWcMUaa	I'm a single full time dad, and well yeah it has been kind of hard dating. I don' know but for some reason, I don't think many girls like a guy with kid(s)... :( Am I wrong ? Anyways.. God Bless all you single mom's out there.. Please continue to pray for your perfect mate, and just know that God has someone for us all.. male or female :)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Story to share.  I was a single mom when it wasn't acceptable to be one.  However, I worked and took care of my child.  (In this case the guy didn't want anything to do w/baby at all and this was before DNA to prove anything)  I was still able to go out w/friends when my Mom would watch the baby on Sat. evenings.  I did meet someone and got married and has one more child.  So yes, it can happen and no one should stay together and be miserable.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	If you really can't work it out with him then leave, but remember that child support and custody issues will continue until the child is 18 so make sure you leave the situation as friendly as possible.  Get your agreements in writing.    I left my husband when  1 son was 2 yo.  Had no trouble with relationships even though I felt like used goods.     Married my new husband last year, when  1 son was 11.  We met at work.  Now we have a child together too.
lIpjuMTHaa	It could happen. I was actively taking Yaz and we weren't wearing condoms. I got pregnant just a few days before my period. But honestly the chances of it happening to you are slim. The doctors were pretty surprised it happened to me.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    low but very possible.    God Bless x wait and see if period is odd.  pill isnt 100% effective there is always a chance.|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	ur chances are slim...lol...seriously it is...good luck hun|`|2DL4GMcgaa	It won't happen. Try again next month.|`|sI0HbV68aa	chances are very slim, especially if you're on the pill.  I don't blame you, I never trusted the pill completely.  Don't stress, if you do you will delay your period and it will scare you even more.  Just relax and don't worry!
WBw9lDG8aa	hmmmm. it could be possible but sometimes implantation bleeding could mean all kinds of things like i could name 4 things  1.old blood  2.ur starting to become irregular with ur period  3.ur probably pregnant  4.ur period is changing date's   i dont know but u should trying to take a HPT well good luck i hoped i helped a lil.|`|SzNmGV0Daa	It mostly depends on the color and amount. If it is bright red, that's not usually a good sign. If it's brown-ish then that is implantation bleeding or old blood. Take a test and goodluck!

OBgqkkqlaa	Im pregnant now, but I'm only nine weeks. I get slight cramps here and there but they feel different from period cramps. Mine usually only last a few seconds. Maybe 10 or 15 seconds. I don't get them everyday so it's hard to say how often. Hope I was of some kind of help.|`|1xZ3lqSGaa	It is cramps or contraction? Cramps isn't good to have. Contraction it lasted 5-7 min apart it depens how long it was also.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	not every woman experience this. i would of been so worried if i did have cramps during pregnancy. i mean besides foot cramps i am sure i didnt get any|`|p0prrzf2aa	I'm only 10 weeks and i still get some cramps off and on. i cramped bad at 2-4 weeks. it would last a couple mins, some would only last seconds. i don't cramp everyday like i use to|`|kZFov1x6aa	are you referring to contractions? braxton hicks? normal pregnancy aches and pains?
jNErU39iaa	My daughter just has to sit there and breath. She is adorable at every moment.    =D|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl is 4 months, and she loves to be sung to!  Whenever I sing to her she stares at me, and I don't know if she's just talking to me or singing with me, but she always does her baby babble right along with me!  Even if she's cranky and fussing, if I start singing to her she most of the times stops fussing and gets all smiley!!  I love it, and it melts my heart every time!|`|KWHiJbhaaa	My son is almost three months old now and he is laughing! Which I love, he also just started batting at his toys, and ohh he loves to pull mommies hair lol not to keen on that.|`|tA7WDLm4aa	well, mine is much younger at 3.5 months old, but he is starting to get SUCH a personality.  Today he rolled over for the first time, and laughed every time he did it like he was so proud of himself.  He is also starting to talk and sometimes he gets so excited that he is practically screaming.  It's hilarious.  I have a feeling I'm in for it with him hahaha.|`|9kPPmazoaa	Everything she does I think is sooooo adorable!!!!    But one of my favorites...  When I give her a kiss and she's half asleep.... she smiles (with her eyes closed) My heart melts everytime :)    Also... I love when she's talking a lot (cooing). Its soooo cute. I talk back to her, we hold a whole conversation sometimes. Although neither of us can understand what the other one is saying, lol.    ... Basically everything!!!    I love when I am holding her and she just stares at me for the longest time. I wonder what she's thinking???     I love my little girl!!!|`|wFVLP5l3aa	my sons 7 weeks old and hes so cute when he smiles when im feeding him, smiles and giggles in his sleep  and when hes fast asleep in my arms|`|3b3ff67447b873310e5ad46c73b2e37baa	I was just going to say clap hands!

I am not sure what state you live in, but in the state of Texas, you would qualify for Medicaid AND CHIP BEFORE your precious baby arrives.    Your state department of health and human services is where you need to start.  I know that a lot of states' websites are inconclusive, so you need to CALL them and make an appointment.  Not only will they find a way to insure BOTH  you and your baby, they will also help you find other resources to assist you now that you are unemployed.  THERE IS A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLE... they just don't advertise it.  You could qualify for financial assistance, insurance, food assistance, rent assistance and DEFINITELY WIC.      Please contact them FIRST THING TOMORROW!  Make your appointment ASAP - the economy is so bad now that appointments are few and far between.  You CAN do this!  It isn't fun, but it is SO COMPLETELY WORTH IT for YOU AND YOUR BABY!    Congratulations again and GOOD LUCK with your precious little one!
prqrQcd1aa	My boyfriend and i spend about 400 dollars a month on food, we budget our selves very carefully because he is the only one working right now. We are feeding 5 people. We don't qualify for assistance for food through food stamps but we do qualify for wic right now, and trust me, it comes in handy when you have 3 kids and a gallon of milk is 4 dollars, and you go through atleast a gallon a day!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	WOW....well I am feeding a family of 3 adults and 2 kids, and we eat a lot of produce and lean meats which seem to be more expensive.  I spend at least $100 a week.  A typical visit to the grocery store gets me: skinless boneless chicken breasts, lean ground sirloin, lettuce, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, limes, lemons, herbs, fruit, orange juice, milk, eggs, creamer, bread, frozen waffles, lunch meat.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	for 3 adults and 2 kids we spend like 100 to 150 a week?|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	about $1200/month $600 every 2 weeks when you have a family it costs a lot|`|CX9xijmtaa	i spend about 20 bucks a week on candy if that counts|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My household spends about 200-300 a month.  That feeds 4 adults, a toddler and a dog.|`|OMcIR0gYaa	i think its low we have to spend anywhere from 600-700 for 6 people every month... how many are you feeding?|`|LFcrAZAaaa	You have no idea...  We spend about $4000 per month buying foo because we go to a really expensive restaurant at least 2 times a week.  It's good...  =D|`|Kr09aQJkaa	We spend about $650 a month for a family of seven. That includes sack lunches for hubby and kids.|`|g9qiRBviaa	Is this for you and a child? (Because it's in the Parenting section.) We have a family of four and spend $130 a week or less on groceries including toiletries--in other words, anything you can find in a grocery store. Charcoal briquettes for grilling, toilet paper, all that sort of stuff in addition to food.    If I had to guess the "just food" part, I'd say about $100 a week.    It partially depends upon where you live. Groceries are exorbitant where I live.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	We spend about $600 a month. Thats for one pregnant woman, one 4 year old, and a man 29 years old.|`|1pNt9892aa	For a family of two(this includes my husband who eats like a horse) and a toddler, we spend roughly $40 weekly, or around $160-200 a month. We plan out our meals every week and only buy what we need. We used to only spend $35 a week, but groceries have become more expensive. We could probably lower our monthly grocery bill, but I choose not to sacrifice quality over price. I would rather pay a little more for a better product than pay less for a product that I will not enjoy or that is less healthy.    I should also add that because I am at university, as is my husband, some of our meals are paid with through our tuition. Those meals are typically lunches on campus.    Edit: Why in the world am I being thumbed down for giving an honest answer?|`|X0xHXDcTaa	We are a family of 5 and normally about $400 a week. We shop at the commissary though (military grocery store). So things are A LOT cheaper. I went home for a few weeks during the holidays and had to do my shopping in a local grocery store. My grocery bill went way up! I would say it would have been about $650 a month.|`|TQW5E6olaa	$50/week, There's 2 of us (1 adult 1 toddler) and it includes eating out.|`|AA11210211	wow 90 dollars a month that is low??Do you not have a child??

For Me my Husband and My 15 month old|`|TN3Sthbwaa	We spend about 600 a month, we are feeding 5 mouths.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	My husband and I spend roughly around $150.00 a month and that includes our food and the baby formula and such.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	3 of us, husband, 14 month old, and me. I spend about $100-125 per week including diapers, wipes, shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, toilet paper, etc. The actually food cost is probably $90 a week I'd guess.    We eat store brand food and buy vegetables that are on sale that week... I'm really into coupons and sales and sometimes go to 4 different stores to get the best deals.|`|AA12221392	I spend about 200.00 a month for 5 people....    That is really tight right now, but my kids eat breakfast at school, and lunch, so I really just have dinner to do.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I spend maybe, gosh, 140 a week. Feeding 2 adults and a child|`|el8yX5q3aa	WOW....I would love to have that.  :)))    I spend about 500 a month.  There are two of us...by my one son comes over a lot and then my other kids and their families come over at least once a month to have dinner.    If I have a party or something though...it goes WAY up.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	We spend roughly $600 a month for 2 adults and 1 child, all fresh nothing prepacked in my household :P    And here in Australia we do not get an assistance for groceries, well at least not that i know of.
AA12220887	This child has suppressed anger coming from somewhere --- either jealousy of a sibling or just not being parented.  He needs to learn that at our people's homes there are rules.  If he can't abide by them, then I'd notify the parents that he's no longer welcome at your daycare.|`|fWGwZ0Ggaa	i think the child is just acting up in front of his father. my daughter acts similar when i pick her up from day care. you may have to deal with it. he's a child. kids act like that sometimes.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	it sounds like the four year old acts out of behaviour because of no attention from the father. that could be the reason why the son gets all frustrated and upset when his dad comes to get him and his sibling. he might also be jealous. you should have a talk with the father and explain that you been noticing this odd behaviour from the 4 year old at pick up times. maybe you can work to a solution. etc where he gives more time to guide attention to the 4 year old when he comes to get the kids. like being there for his son and asking him how his day went instead of going straight for the one year old. i bet the little guy feels left out. thats why his behaviour and aggressiveness is being displayed.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	My first suggestion would be if "you" run this daycare, then "you" need to handle each situation with your clients on your own. Just as you would not expect for your 6 year old child's teacher at school to have her husband come to you on how big of a brat your child is at school. Your husband works elsewhere as he was "off" that day. I would expect an all out apology from him if I were these children's father, because first of all you don't yell at anyone, what does that show your children? Second is, if you don't mention the issues that are bothering you to this parent, prior to having your husband do your dirty work for you, then how do you expect someone to know. Parents handle their own children's flaws and outbursts much better then they do other children's.     When you run any business, work in your marriage, or raising a child, you must know that communication is key, just as when you are punishing a child, working for a corporation, or any other situation. You have to communicate. Explain what your issues are in a kind and mature manner, don't make them feel as if you are attacking their children or their parenting. Explain creative ways you think that this issue can be resolved, by working together.     I don't know how you would expect anyone to react any differently if someone comes to them attacking them in a very hurtful and hateful manner concerning their children and parenting other then to try and defend themselves and his way rather then popping your husband or being just as ugly as him was to say his children learned it somewhere, if it had came in a nicer and more professional manner maybe the response you would have gotten would have been much more open and concerning.

No decent father or mother kidnaps a child and takes them away from their parent.      It is also just that much more of how horrible a parent he is, if he is essentially going to use the child to either keep the mother hostage in a different country, or else she never sees her child.  To me that is just an evil thing to do to both children and the other parent.
Ki0uUdwOaa	It doesnt work this way.  As an adult, the child will most likely be curious about the parent they were kept away from and wonder why they did not fight for them.  I would rather risk my child being angry because I tried to fight, rather than resenting me because I did not.
68c6B8dRaa	A very small number of women on here wanted to breastfeed and ran into problems, struggled -- sometimes it's not so easy to find the support you need -- and didn't manage to nurse for long.    A very large number of women on here decided it was too hard, and quit, and make up BS about it to assuage their guilt.    Some women think that because they're not engorged and leaking they don't have milk, which is nonsense...your milk will be there. If baby is not latching well, find La Leche League or a IBCLC.     You will be successful on account of the entirety of mammalian history, which should assure you that nursing is a highly successful process.    If you want to minimize problems -- don't use bottles or pumps, just nurse.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	if your baby won't latch you can keep trying- my son would not latch at first and he finally did- if you don't offer a bottle they are going to latch to something.  DO NOT boy formula just in case- if you truly do need store are open all the time  less than 3% of women in the world don't make enough milk- they usually have underlying medical issue like hypothyroidism  if you buy formula you are likrely to use it when there really isn't a problem instead of getting help. most women say they couldn't breastfeed when they COULD have it was just difficult. breastfeeding can be hard at first but it gets very easy.  http://www.kellymom.com/     here is a great website for you YOU DO NOT havee to give formula until your milk comes in more!- if you do that it will delay it and reduce your supply- the more you nurse the more you make. supplementing utnil your milk fully comes in can delay if from coming it and ultimately you won't make enough. a baby nursing all the time does not mean you don't have enough milk, it just means baby is building your supply and they like being at your breast|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah, you'll be ok, just don't give up and just know your doing the best thing for your baby !! Truly !!! Anyways.. blessings on your new endavor and rember the Creator who gave you and your child life...        In Jesus Name|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Your success does not hang in the balance because of some one else's failure.  If you want to breast feed, DO IT!.  The main things you may come up against it breasts cracking or bleeding.  That is usually caused by baby not latching properly and the new constant use of your breasts.  Make sure you have some lanolin on hand.  Lansinoh is a popular brand.  As far as latching, just make sure that baby's mouth fully covers around the areola not latching directly to the nipple.  this may take some time for the two of you to get the hang of but just relax, it happens naturally, and after you have been nursing for a couple of months it will just feel like it's something you do, like breathing.   As far as your milk not coming in.  That is very rare and is usually caused by all the drugs pumped into you in a hospital.  Have you considered or talked to your doctor about a natural, low intervention birth.  That is best for you and baby anyhow and gives chance for optimal start to life and breast feeding.  Good luck and God bless.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I was lucky- I was able to breastfeed with no problem.  They show you how to do it at the hospital, and the important thing to do is keep at it.  It may be uncomfortable at first, but the pain will go away as you get used to it.  There will be a lactation consultant at the hospital who will show you everything you need to know about latching on and how to keep up your mild supply.  I would buy formula later on if you plan to supplement.  I started formula when I went back to work.|`|wphLaVs6aa	Congratulations on the impending arrival of your baby!    I understand your discouragement. I'm a breastfeeding mom and am shocked by all the women who say they can't breastfeed. The vast majority of women CAN breastfeed. A lot of problems that women have with breastfeeding are actually caused by supplementation with formula. Granted, there are other completely valid reasons why women can't breastfeed, but how would our species have survived this long if the overwhelming majority of women couldn't breastfeed? Formula has made breastfeeding optional, and when something that is hard is optional, it's far easier to give up. Many breastfeeding problems can be overcome, or avoided altogether.    This is directed at a previous answer: DON'T buy formula and supplement with formula until your milk comes in. There are two very good reasons for this:    1. You want you baby at your breast as much as possible in the beginning. This ensures that baby is getting the colostrum, which is incredibly good for your baby and cannot be replicated by formula. If you supplement with formula, your baby will get less of this good stuff. (Babies fill up very quickly when they are newborns!)    2. Breast milk is produced on a supply and demand basis, meaning that the more baby suckles and empties the breast, the more milk your body will make. If you supplement with formula from the beginning, your body will make less milk and the process of your milk coming in may be disrupted. It is normal for babies to lose weight in the days right after birth while they wait for their mothers' milk to come in. They don't need 24 ounces of milk per day in those early days before the milk has come in. Nature takes care of itself.    It's unlikely that your milk won't come in if you put your baby to your breast frequently. Don't be surprised if your baby wants to be at your breast often and for long periods of time. The breast is not only nourishment, but comforting.    It's unlikely that your baby will not latch. Be sure to spend time latching your baby very soon after birth. Ask a nurse to take a look at the latch and help you adjust it if you need help. Go to the breastfeeding classes at the hospital. And ask for help if you ever need it. You can call a La Leche League mother for free. Just go their website and look for one in your area.    Good luck!!! Breastfeeding is an amazing experience -- loving, calming, bonding. It's not easy -- it demands a lot of time and patience, but it gets so much easier as time goes on. And it's the absolute best for your baby.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Don't buy formula, it encourages failure  If you nurse on demand without supplementing, your milk will come in  Have the hospital lactation consultant visit before you are  discharged from the hospital and read everything you can now about nursing.   http://www.kellymom.com/index.html and the book " The womanly art of breastfeeding" are great places to start.    If you keep telling yourself you will succeed at breastfeeding, you will succeed at breastfeeding.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	I had very little colostrum during the first 4 days.   I would end up feeding him some formula  right after nursing so he would stop crying and feel full.   By day 4, my milk came in and I had plenty so no more formula.   I exclusively nursed after that for 5 months.   There were no latching problems.    I disagree with those who say that you shouldn't get a can of formula just in case.   What are you going to do if you don't have enough?  Just let him cry?   I don't think so.  That would be cruel.   The milk will come in soon enough and I had PLENTY despite supplementing those first few days.|`|AA11476951	Don't let people scare you. My babies come out and latched on perfectly the first time. You'll be fine. If something is wrong and you can't do it the hospital will give you formula while you're there and a little to take home. Don't plan to formula feed. Breastfeeding is a wonderful experience and great for baby. Those babies can sense your insecurity and may have more trouble nursing if you are thinking that it's just not going to work. Also, don't let the hospital give the baby bottles of any kind! The baby realizes quite quickly how much easier bottles are and no longer wants the breast because it's more work.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Honestly, the majority of women who "couldn't" breastfeed were unsuccessful due to misinformation about it.  A bad latch, supplementing with formula, feeding on a schedule...all common mistakes and stumbling blocks that lead to early weaning.     Do NOT buy formula.  Your milk will come in, and encourage it by nursing constantly.  It is practice for you and baby, and will stimulate your milk to come in faster.  :)    If you have terrible pain while nursing, it's likely a latch issue.  See a GOOD lactation consulant (IBCLC) or contact La Leche League.      **Before your baby comes, read up on it.  Education is power!  I loved "So That's What They're For!" by Janet Tamaro.  Dr Newman has the "Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers" and LLL has "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding."      Trust your body honey.  We are mammals, made to nurse our babies.  :)|`|n3PE2lvDaa	hun dont worry about it. If you are determined to breastfeed you will get there. It can be a bit tricky in the beginning but you will get there if you want to.   It is very unlikely your milk wont come in that hardly ever happens  Your baby might have trouble latching at first (alot do) but just stay in the hospital or go to a maternity home for a few nights and have the nursers help you. I have never personally meet a baby that hasnt got the hang of latching after a day or two and all my friends breastfeed. Good luck  I hope others dont hate me for saying this but most of the time a mother dosnt breastfeed because she gives in too quickly. Usually due to bad advice. Being told to just put them on formula instead of being helped in learning to breastfeed. the more baby sucks the more milk you will get. Alot of mothers give up thinking they dont have milk when if they just persisted the milk would soon come.  Few people are unlucky enough to not make milk.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	First of all, congrats on the baby.    Most likely, you WILL be able to sucessfully breastfeed.  If you really want to do it, I wouldn't keep any formula in the house, because if you start supplementing, you will have a hard time building up your milk supply.      I have every confidence in you!      And if there is a chance you won't be able to (which is a teeny, tiny chance!), there's nothing wrong with formula.|`|Bw18seFqaa	there's nothing wrong with getting some formula for a back up.. but I wouldnt rush out and buy a case.. you just may want some to help supplement until your milk comes in more.    Your milk will come in... its very rare that a woman doesnt lactate.    your baby will learn to latch..  the instinct to root and suck is natural..  you will both learn how to get the baby to latch on properly tho.    I reccomend you talk to a lactation consultant at the hospital, or contact your local la leche..  many of them do have weekly meetings.. you could probably go to one now and talk to successful breastfeeding moms.    Most people fail at breastfeeding simply because they get discouraged.. its hard those first few weeks.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Go to a prenatal breastfeeding class.  They have a wealth of TRUE information!  Most likely everything will go just fine.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	There is alot of negativity out there regarding breast feeding, I nursed both my children for almost a year each. I would keep some formular on hand, but you wont need it right away, your milk will come in after about 3-5 days after you deliver ( I have heard of it taking a little longer with mom's who have a c-section, but I really dont know how true that is!) The latch IS important, and I am not going to lie to you it hurts at first and the first week will be difficult, it is important to remember that this is what your body is made for! You CAN do it! You'll have to keep in mind that you and your baby will be learning together, so have some patience, and buy a breast pump so you can pass off some feedings to daddy/grandma/grandpa/auntie whoever with a bottle :)    I hope this helps! I wish you the best of luck!|`|g99hQLkNaa	It might seem discouraging cause the only people that are going to ask questions are the ones who need answers, those being the ones who have problems.  Personally, i don't think you need to buy formula unless you know for sure you are going to need it. If something happens and you can't feed the baby after you give birth the hospital would have some . It isn't very likely that you wont have any milk. That is extremely rare. Now about that baby latching, it isn't likely that the baby wont latch. It is likely however, to have difficulties with latching though. But that is normal, most women go through it and get over it with no problem. If you can get past the first few weeks of nursing (the hardest time cause you and baby are both learning) then you will be fine. If you do have problems the lactation people at the hospital should be able to help you. Don't worry about it, you will be fine. Besides worrying wont do anything for you but cause you grief. Just learn to overcome the problems when they arise, if they arise. Good luck!|`|s4FEJiNHaa	why r u putting so much stock in what people r saying on YA?  Seriously, any jackass with Internet access can come on here and say any ridiculous thing!  I should know!  Sometimes, I'm one of those jackasses.

Before u check out of the hospital, ask the doctors and nurses for some professional guidance on this issue.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	It's very likely you will be successful.  This is yahoo answers, people looking for help, generally women who are doing well with breast feeding don't ask questions about it which is why you don't see those stories around here, that's all.    In the hospital you can talk to a lacatation consultant about your worries, she should help you with how to get the proper latch, and how to tell if your milk isn't coming in.   Have confidence in yourself and relax about it, remember baby can feel when you are stress, so when it comes time to breastfeed try it in a nice quiet area first, where you are relaxed, soothing music and all.    Here are some great resources,    http://www.lllusa.org/    http://www.kellymom.com/|`|9cu82009aa	Do what you feel like doing, keep formula (you only need to buy one for now anyways) on hand just incase. I couldn't breastfeed with our first because my milk didn't come in properly. My second and third I expressed, because my skin is so sensitive I had HUGE blisters. The only problem is the two I did breastfeed have allergies and the one I bottle fed has no problems, don't let that discourage you though, I'm allergic to wheat and gluten, and whilst they have built up immunity to those, they're lost their immunity to other allergies. That's the only reason I'm not breast feeding this time.  So basically if you don't have an allergy try and breast feed.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	It's not easy.. it's a beautiful, natural thing but sometimes it doesn't feel like it! When bub is born, they'll help you in the hospital. They'll show you how to position your baby and get him to latch on. There are lactation consultants there who will give you a hand and work out what's best for you and your bub. My boosies point outward when they're full of milk so they got me to hold my daughter in a football hold. There are many ways to do it so DON'T WORRY! We also ended up using nipple shields - easy peasy.    And I'm not a nipple nazi either btw... It didn't work out for us in the end and we ended up on formula.. but hey that's OKAY too! :-)     I think there's a bit of psychology involved too. So think "milk milk milk" and it'll flow - but it takes time so be patient and all will be fine!|`|TUSNeUCcaa	It's your lucky day! because I'm a Answers user who could Breastfeed! 3 babies in fact all for 18 mths when they weaned of their own accord. Breastfeeding isn't something you or your Baby know how to do you both have to learn it just like anything else you haven't done before. But let me say this it's well worth giving it your best shot but also not beating yourself up if you don't succeed Being a good Mother isn't measured by whether you Breastfed or not. Hopefully there is a Lactation Consultant at the Hospital where you'll give birth that way if you do encounter any big problems you'll have expert help right there Just remember you know what is best for you & your Baby & while you are in Hospital take Advantage of the Midwives & ask lots of Questions & don't be scared to ask for help it's your 1st Child after all I'm sure with lots of support & knowledge you'll do fine By the way only buy a sample of Formula till you know if you are going to need it & in Answer to your other 2 Q's not very unlikely the Midwives will help you with the right Latching Technique & Baby's correct sucking stimulates Milk Production Good Luck!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	Don't sweat it.  Even if you do have problems, most of them can be easily solved.  Most of the people who ask questions about problems are more worried than having actual problems.  Most new moms think they are losing their milk supply, when in reality they have plently.  I had a premature baby, and she had latching issues, and I had to use a nipple shield for 2 months, and it was a battle at first, but after 2 months, she nursed wonderfully, and yes it was hard at first, but totally worth it in the end.  Even if you have issues, there are people to help, such as the hospital's lactation consultant.  Usually, the lactation consultant will visit you in the hospital before you check out, and make sure everything is going well if you are planning to breastfeed.  And you can go back and visit with them anytime.  I was probably at my hospital about twice a week for the first month, seeing the lactation consultant.  It really isn't as big a deal as it sounds.  If you are determined, you'll make it happen.|`|cG80UU5Waa	I am going to get a zillion thumbs down for this, but most women who "can't" breastfeed really could if they had either tried harder or had better guidance and support.    Don't buy any formula.    Don't let the nurses in the hospital give your baby formula.    Don't supplement with formula because you think your baby is hungry and you don't have enough milk--if you do this you really won't have milk because you'll lose your supply.    Don't give your baby a bottle. Bottles and artificial nipples cause nipple confusion and it's a big cause of latch problems.     Your milk will come in, but it can take up to a week. Mine came in on day 4. The only thing they need for the first few days is the colostrum though, and if you give them formula they won't!  Make certain to feed on demand (even if it's all the time!) so you build up your milk supply. Newborns tend to cluster feed, and it can be frustrating but that's what it takes to build your supply. Also, breastfeeding babies feed more frequently, my baby would eat every hour or so while awake during growth spurts. It's normal. Also, remember that once your milk comes in, you are never "empty" since you constantly make milk. It may take your breastfed baby longer to get his tummy full, but it will happen if you let them feed on demand for as long as they want.    It can really suck at first. Buy some lansinoh lanolin and put it on after every feeding to prevent cracked nipples, but realize that they WILL be sore, and it will last a few weeks.    But a cheap manual hand pump for when your milk comes in, because you get engorged (your boobs feel like rocks!) and it's hard for baby to latch on. When this happens just grab the pump and pump a half ounce or so until your breast is softer and that makes it easier for baby to latch on. Engorgment from when your milk comes in usually lasts 24-48 hours.    Don't screw around with pumping otherwise.    Read up at kellymom.com and llli.org BEFORE you give birth so you know what to expect.    Don't be afraid to ask for help, and in the hospital call a nurse to help you get the baby latched on until you feel comfortable. It's a little weird but it helps.     Don't worry, your baby will lose weight the first few days of life. The nurses/doctors will tell you if it's too much. DON'T give formula unless your pediatrician tells you to because your baby is failing to gain weight. You'll usually have 2 check-ups the first month to make sure the baby is gaining, they'll tell you if something is wrong.|`|Xg3CtRGWaa	Should I buy formula just in case? - I got free formula from the hospital even though they knew I would be exclusively breastfeeding; if you don't get some you can send someone out on an errand when you get home.    How likely is it my milk won't come in? Not at all likely - I'm not even sure that it is possible if you are at least trying.    How likely is it my baby won't latch? Some babies need more help at it than others. The key is to be persistent and patient.    By the fifth day of breastfeeding I was in tears because it was very painful and I was exhausted and totally discouraged. I went to see a lactation consultant who helped us get a proper latch going and gave me some encouragement.    I strongly recommend that you seek support now from friends and family. There were many times in the first three weeks that I felt like giving up, but I had a lot of cheerleaders to help me keep at it.    Good luck!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	The vast majority of women are physically able to breastfeed. That's not to say that a good number of women don't have issues breastfeeding. If you have it stuck in your head that you will breastfeed that you have a huge probability of being successful. I had problems, my son wouldn't latch properly, I had cracked, scabbed, and bleeding nipples, it hurt like heck. I had milk though so formula feeding wasn't an option for me. A friend of mine gave birth the same week and had all of the same issues and switched to formula by 4wks. We both had ample milk. If you are willing to work out any problems that come up you will be fine.    Do not buy formula! If I had it in the house during the first few weeks when I had all of the issues I would have sabotaged my own efforts. Also don't use bottles or pacifiers the firew few weeks. One bottle of formula during the early weeks is all it takes to reduce your supply, it also leads to more formula very quickly. I don't know anyone that "just used a little" and didn't end up switching quickly.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Don't be discouraged. I'm sure you'll do just fine. They have things to help with your milk production like teas. Also they have "nipple sheilds" they are women who have latch problems.

Relax|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Don't go out and buy a can of formula just yet. The nurses at the hospital are very helpful in helping you get your baby to latch. A lot of the nurses I had took classes in breastfeeding and were very helpful. The ONLY reason I could not breast feed was because my son was a 34 week preemie and was too small to latch onto my breast (he was 4lbs 4oz at birth). My milk came in fine, his mouth was just too small to latch. I ended up pumping for 3 months for my son. When he was finally big enough to latch, he was used to the bottle and I couldn't get him to stay on. If you find you are having trouble breastfeeding and have to use formula, the nurses will give you samples of formula to take home with you just in case. You can do it though! Don't be discouraged from my story or anyone else's story.
VN8kBnuRaa	As much as it hurts, you need to report her parents. And yes, your friend might get mad, but honestly sweety, what is more important? Your friend staying there, become pregnant and they treat her that way during her pregnancy and the baby be corrupted by it, or you getting her OUT of there and with a family who WILL love her and appreciate her.    I would start by talking to your parents and the school counsler|`|36DLWXc4aa	My honest opinion to you is detach yourself from the situation.   You're both 14 and I know you may not want to see your friend "ruin" her life, but if she does, and you're standing beside her, it's most defiantely doing to affect you aswell.    As for her Cinderella plight, WELCOME TO BEING THE OLDEST. Parents rely on the oldest child alot more than they do the youngest for a reason, you're older and (generally) more responsible.    If her cries for attention are drawing her to becoming a parent herself, she'll only learn the hard way. I've had friends fall pregnant for the same reasons - attention and "love", it doesn't work out that way in the end.    There's a reason that 14 yr old's feel so "ho hum" about life and why they feel neglected/used and as if they're treated like dirt. It's realisation you're growing up. You're treated more like an adult and given more responsibility. Best bet, don't compare yourself to younger siblings.    She may be asked to do a few chores by her parents, or be "treated like dirt", but it's only going to be as bad or as good as she lets it be.    The sooner she learns that having a child isn't the right thing to do, and the sooner you realise it's not your problem, the better the outcome will be.    If she still decides to have a child, you've spoken to her about it (assumed?) what happens happens. It STILL isn't your business or responsibility.      The best you could do is perhaps SUGGEST to her to speak to a young mothers/parents group in your area or talk to a family planning clinic. Then wash your hands of the matter.|`|Jswomud7aa	Just tell her she's an idiot if she gets pregnant... if she thinks her life is bad now, having a baby will anchor her down even more, and she will obviously have to live in the same house, how will her parents treat an unwanted baby?!

You'll have to have certain prenatal tests done, and perhaps procedures to make sure the baby (and you) can become tolerant of each other's blood type in case this baby is not O-type.    Doctors have this stuff figured out, so don't worry.  It'll just mean you'll be visiting the doctor more often, and having to spend a little more time and money (maybe) having specialized procedures done.  Doctors would give you doses of A/B, or AB antibodies if your baby is either or both.  Not a problem!    The concern comes when you and the baby have an incompatible RH factor.  (They would also give you small doses of the RH factor compatible with your baby, so also NOT A PROBLEM!)

BUT GOOD LUCK TO YOU BOTH.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	The blood types aren't an issue - the Rh factor (if you're negative) which is the problem. However, thanks to science there's a medication that you would be given (it's called Rhogam) to prevent any complications with your pregnancy.|`|7985765d6a74cb0a72eb5c2728025a86aa	It does not matter what blood type each parent is, what does matter is if you are port RH + or RH -.  A simple blood test will tell you that. If one of you is - and the other +,your Dr can give you a shot so everything will be all right.

Women that have it further into the pregnancy like 12 weeks and further it can take longer as the uterus must clean it's self out and the body must readjust from being pregnant.  If it was an early pregnancy then it shoudl really phase you.|`|AA10424047	6 weeks after my first miscarriage.

Zi6Fr49Laa	It sounds to me like your niece isn't the one that needs to do the apologizing. Your sister/SIL is being really immature. Making her child feel like her mom hates her is not the way to fix the problems that she's having. She got 6 D's on her report card---is that not negative enough without making her feel like **** on top of that? The silent treatment may have been okay for dealing with her ex in junior high, but not for her teenage daughter. My Mom pulled that ridiculous B.S., telling me she was kicking me out and constantly taking things away from me. I eventually stopped wanting any presents from her because they weren't out of love, they were just things to hang over my head. I'm still that way now, and I also have ZERO respect for her. I got my first job when I was fifteen so I could buy my own clothes, my own gas for my car, EVERYTHING that I could get on my own legally at that age just to avoid receiving "hand-outs" that my parents could hang over my head, and that is the best decision I've ever made. Get to the bottom of why your niece is doing poorly in school, and encourage her to get a job to pay for her own phone. Having her own job and her own income will give her a sense of accomplishment (not to mention money) and will boost her self-esteem since she won't have to rely on her immature mother as much.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	wait until her mom cools down (a couple hours or so) then invite her mom over to your house so they can talk together calmly. if they can't, have your niece stay at your house for a few days. you never know what people will do in the heat of anger..!|`|fKDZlxOsaa	let your neice throw a brick through her window with a letter of apology for the grades and cell phone bill. that way they don't actually have to see each other.|`|7XweQxIUaa	maybe let her stay with you for a couple days, until things cool off....then walk her to her house to talk to her mom, and take it day by day from there....|`|QGkBZFqWaa	What the crap?  Why would you kick your kid out just because of their grades?    That lady needs to get a grip.  Until then I think you should let her stay with you.|`|AA12005593	Tell her to say that, She's sorry that she got 6 D's on her report card because of finals, and that she will study  harder and ask her teacher's if theres anything she can do (like extra credit work) to raise her grades, and she will babysit or work or do something to get $130 for her phone bill.    her mom shouldn't be that mad, really.  she's taking things to far.|`|HOdblqIkaa	She should give her mom some time and space. At least she went to you instead of someplace she could have gotten in trouble at. She will have to prove to her mom she can be responsible for her grades and cell phone use. A phone is a privilege and some parents have unspoken rules that if you break them you get some sort of punishment. Since she isn't paying the bill it is fair. Her mom might be reacting to more than just grades and bills and maybe she needs time alone to work on things or maybe she needs someone to talk to but doesn't have anyone. Only time will tell but she should go home and apologize sometime soon.|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	let your neice stay at your house for a couple of days  then you go out for lunch with her mom lik wednesday or so  and you talk to her  it might be easier coming from her sister.|`|207dFmdHaa	well thats kinda the problem, she is her mom, not her best friend. Let her stay with you tonight. Tomorrow she needs to call her mom and say lets talk, she needs to tell her mom how sorry she is and mean it. Her mother needs to go to school with her and talk to her teachers and see what can be done this next semester to impove the grades, as far as the phone, if she were my daughter she would not get it back until the grades improved and she could pay half of the bill. Her mom needs to chill out a little too, she is acting like a friend who has been hurt, not a mother who has a child in trouble.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	Wait until her mom gets over it, if she does. I dont think that there is anything she can do until then.     ~happygurl|`|JAJVHc9uaa	Lots of D's are bad grades 130 on a phone bill is a lot.  But her mother cants kick her out of the house!!!  Thats just mean!
1UpR1vSCaa	no pink or brown discharge is good while pregnant check  with you're doctor you might have an infection|`|2DL4GMcgaa	I've never had a brown or pink discharge during my 2 pregnancies. That sounds like a disease.|`|Cjaphf0Iaa	it all depends, a few hours, a day to two...|`|A2wVXRHKaa	be careful with that you might have an infection...but you could see that thru out your pregnancy good luck|`|sI0HbV68aa	You may want to see your doctor.  When I was pregnant, I went about one week with brown discharge.  Everyone (including nurses when I called my doctor) told me is was normal, that the uterus is growing.  Unfortunately, a week later, I miscarried my baby at 13 weeks.  I don't mean to scare you, but I will be very cautious on my next pregnancy.    Good Luck!
PAjHWRhsaa	Don't lose hope. Depending on when implantation occured you may not get a positive until a week after your missed period. Here is sort of an example...28 day cycle, ovulate on day 14, implant on 8 dpo, which is cycle day 22. So, day 22 your hcg would be close to 1 and it doubles every 48 hours or so....so day 24 would be 2, day 26 would be 4, day 28 (expected day of period) it is 8, day 30 would be 16, day 32 would be 32. So that puts it at 4 days past your missed period. You could test positive then with a test that tests positive at 25. So if you didn't implant until day 8-10 it is possible you won't get a positive until a few days past your missed period. I read somewhere that something like 80 percent of women implant late. So don't lose hope!! Good luck! And test with first morning urine. It is more concentrated so a higher amount of the hormone will be in that urine.
WBw9lDG8aa	yes it sure possible 4 u 2 come ot PGS b-cuz that's what happened to my sister in law and lil did she know that she was PGS so to ur question yes u could become pregnant good luck i hope i helped a lil bit.
V8wUAVdyaa	I had one.. it got really big after delivery from the pushing and then it went away after a couple of weeks.  Sry.. I know it hurts. :-(|`|AA11785285	Normal, sometimes they get worse, at times fill with blood then there is usually a clot inside that can be lanced by your doc..  This  is just another one of those unpleasant things that happens in pregnancies.    Sometimes they go away, sometimes not.  They can be surgically removed after you deliver.  Ask your doc.  Pretty pointless to ligate it now.|`|9cu82009aa	I'm with the others, cotton balls soaked (not saturated though) in witch hazel and applied (kept there for awhile) will help them reduce in size, and add more fibre, heps of fruit and veges, if you can not do that for some reason metamucil or normafibe (if you have it where you are) helps too.|`|Ela3o96Raa	Witch Hazel has been a life-saver for me. They come in convenient pads (company name is "Tucks") and it is also sold in a bottle as an "herb". If you buy the bottle, soak cotton balls in the witch hazel and enclose in a ziplock bag. Stick it in the freezer until you are ready to use them. Put a pad on and apply the cold witch hazel cotton balls to your hemorrhoids. Dont plan on walking - just lay on the couch for awhile and let them work. Believe me, you'll feel sooo much better.    Hope it helps - I know how painful they can be.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Tucks pads will help , also you should think about adding a little more fiber to your diet so you don't strain when you go   2. >_>    You should let your doctor know your experiencing this.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	I had them throughout all of my pregnancies...they are PAINFUL.  Get witch hazel pads and apply it to the hemorrhoid, it helps with the pain and itchiness.
WBw9lDG8aa	i think you should go ahead and wait till tomorrow morning b-cuz that when ur hormones are high bt i wish u luck and lots of baby dust to u..|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Be patient and wait until tomorrow! That way there will be less doubt in your mind as to the accuracy.     Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|scdOdaTKaa	It could be but only if the hormone is built up....so not likely at this early stage. Best to wait until mornign or even until you miss your period. Less likely to have a false negative.  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|qN5iVvAFaa	it is always best to take a test in the morning... the first time you use the bathroom in the morning... the levels are higher, first thing in the morning|`|PAjHWRhsaa	I would wait. Even though a test claims to test up to five days early, it may not entirely be true. It all depends on when implantation occured. Say for instance, you are 12 dpo today, in order for the early response to pick up your hormone would need to be at 25. If you implanted on say 4 dpo then your hormone levels should be high enough, but if you didn't implant until 8-10 dpo, like most women, then the hormone will more than likely not be high enough to register, especially with pee at night. First morning urine is best, especially when testing before your missed period. I would try to stick it out until at least the day you are supposed to start. Good luck! And lots of baby dust!|`|jKMH27gKaa	I am totally with ya -- some of these "early" tests are really vague when testing early. I have found night testing to be inconclusive (not necessarily inaccurate) unless it's like, the day of or after the period is due. By inconclusive I mean that I'll get an evap line after the time stated on the box and wonder if it's really a faint positive (**cough**Clearblue Easy*cough*); check that the test you're using is detecting for very low (20 or lower!) levels of HCG. And good luck!    Edit: SURE ENOUGH -- after Clearblue Easy's negative, then positive 12 hours later result, I ran a First Response digital 2 days later and got a positive. Hope the same happens for you!|`|SzNmGV0Daa	I agree with bride beatrice, if the test you have will detect low HCG levels then take the test in the morning and Goodluck!
09zVUMBRaa	There are accomplished people that abuse their children, that criteria doesn't qualify you to competently raise a child.  You've already answered the question.  If you feel you're not ready, you're not ready!|`|RVeLHqe9aa	leading a child by example is always best.  Dont just tell the child how to live a nice life, show them.  You should have your priorities set before deciding to have a child.  Children cost money and take up most if not all of your time. a lot of hobbies get put to the side, and a lot of things like college might have to be put on hold.(if you wanted to go back that is)... ya know..|`|AA11684972	Don't use a baby as your "big change". Being a parent isn't about being perfect. Its about acknowledging your childhood (the good and bad parts), and trying your best for your child. Be willing to apologize. Learn from your mistakes. Try your best and don't beat yourself up when you get it wrong. And most of all, always parent out of love and never anger.|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	i prefer leading a child by a leash|`|qN5iVvAFaa	My boyfriend has just made the same decision... he has just decided that he wants to have kids, but we are not quite financially ready... i am in college, and he is working about 30 hours a week... so i know where your coming from|`|gFwD0yeCaa	If you need a change I suggest getting a better/different job or finishing your degree. A baby is definitely a big change, but not a good one if you're not ready.     As far as leading by example, I had my first child at 18 and my second at 20. Started a career in corrections almost 3 years ago. The new job has definitely improved my parenting skills. I don't suggest having a child before you're ready for the responsibility or financially able to take care of the child. The past 6 years have been a huge struggle for me and I'm just now starting to get myself grounded. As I mentioned earlier the new job has helped, but I wish I'd waited until this point in my life to have the kids instead of doing things in reverse.     A new baby should be a happy time, not a "big change" just for the sake of change and not a burden before you're ready.|`|sqOgraXraa	If you wait for your life to be just right before having kids, you'll never have them.  If you want a big change in your life, then go ahead and have kids.  It may not be the change you expect though.  The fact that you're questioning if you're ready and concerned about being a good parent is a good sign, many people don't think that far or have superficial  reasons for having children.  I think the important things for raising children are to be able to be open to taking on responsibility, learn a bit of selflessness, and having the time to provide a caring and loving environment.  Don't worry about designing your life, life usually doesn't check your blueprints first.    I always try-on the idea in my head for a while before jumping into a new life direction.    good luck|`|4FAcbtskaa	All a child needs is a good home with a loving, open-minded family and to know that no matter what they do in life their family will always be there for them.    It isn't like you need to be some kind of super-human to raise a child right, anybody can raise a child right as long as they are patient with them.    Although raising children is a big responsibility, you should probably get a steady and sure supply of cash coming your way before you decide to raise a kid.
yrDqtazLaa	Sharp, zapping pains usually mean one of two things: an ectopic pregnancy, or an ovarian cyst. If it doesn't go away soon, you should contact your OB/GYN and schedule an ultrasound appointment to get it looked at.

3X0Lsk5caa	I had a tooth pulled during this pregnancy, as well. I just had a couple shots and it was fine. You should ask your doctor about it though, because he can prescribe Darvocet (a pain killer) and it's safe to take when pregnant. You will probably want something for after the extraction and your dentist can't really do that for you. Good luck, and don't worry!  EDIT: Your doctor will probably want to give you an antibiotic, as well, so make sure to contact him asap.|`|AA11785285	You need to talk with your doc about this.  If they are infected, he needs to know.
HPRlEWu1aa	how far along are u?
yrDqtazLaa	Don't worry, they would let you know right then and there if it were an ectopic pregnancy, as they would have to remove it quickly before it ruptures your fallopian tube.    It's usually very sharp pain in one side of your abdomen, to the point where you might hunch over in pain or cry/scream.    Edit: It could be a big cyst that hasn't ruptured yet. I had very bad pains on my left side where my ovaries/tubes are, and it finally went away, it was a huge cyst that finally ruptured. If that's not what it is, you might be getting ready for a bad period.|`|k8aqLa5gaa	Ectopic pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose because symptoms often mirror those of a normal early pregnancy. These can include missed periods, breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, or frequent urination.    The first warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy are often pain or vaginal bleeding. You might feel pain in your pelvis, abdomen, or, in extreme cases, even your shoulder or neck (if blood from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy builds up and irritates certain nerves). Most women describe the pain as sharp and stabbing. It may concentrate on one side of the pelvis and come and go or vary in intensity.    Any of the following additional symptoms can also suggest an ectopic pregnancy:    vaginal spotting   dizziness or fainting (caused by blood loss)   low blood pressure (also caused by blood loss)   lower back pain|`|2lpcwUkNaa	sorry friend i do not have any idea about this|`|K2jT1z5jaa	symptoms ;    most common is severe pain - one side of abdomen     god bless x hoep all the best for you

5axGfFofaa	My doc actually said you should wait TWO weeks after a missed period!  He said that many women will show up positive with early testing then they will get their period and a negative test b/c the "pregnancy " was not viable.  He said with early testing you run a 70% chance to not developing a healthy pregnancy.  He also feels that this is not truly a m/c...just a nonviable pregnancy.  This is not what most people will tell you but, after 2 m/c's I kind of like his advice and next time I will TRY to wait two weeks (we all know that is impossible!)    With my first m/c I got a digital positive 9 DPO.  With this last one, it was 13 DPO with digital and EXTREMELY faint line at 12 DPO.|`|sI0HbV68aa	depending on how regular you are....I took a pregnancy test 1-2 days after my missed period and got an accurate result.  They say pregnancy tests are so accurate now, you can test a week before your missed period.  Good Luck!|`|SzNmGV0Daa	The very earliest is five days before your expected period. So if you are expecting your cycle on the 10th then on the fifth you can test that morning. Goodluck!|`|eY3SWMdqaa	I am wondering the SAME thing!! I ovulated about 14 days ago, but haven't had a positive yet..I tested about two days ago. Some preggo tests say 5 days sooner or whatever, but Im not sure about that.

Most women just mistake this as their period. Your body will naturally abort the pregnancy when something goes wrong. It is very, very common. Most women don't know this.     If it was an eptopic pregnancy, you would be having the most horrible cramps of your entire life. What happens then is the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes and grows. Basically they are bursting. If you have painful symptoms go to the doctor asap. If not, your body is doing what it is supposed to be doing right now. Obviously, the pregnancy was abnormal. You are fine.|`|z2SODuR9aa	An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that develops outside a woman's uterus (womb). This happens when the fertilized egg from the ovary does not implant itself normally in the uterus. Instead, the egg develops somewhere else in the abdomen. The products of this conception are abnormal and cannot develop into fetuses.        * The most common place that ectopic pregnancy occurs is in one of the fallopian tubes (a so-called tubal pregnancy). These are the tubes that transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies also can be found on the outside of the uterus, on the ovaries, or attached to the bowel.        * The most serious complication of an ectopic pregnancy is intra-abdominal hemorrhage (severe bleeding). In the case of a tubal pregnancy, for example, as the products of conception continue to grow in the fallopian tube, the tube expands and eventually ruptures. This can be very dangerous because a large artery runs on the outside of each fallopian tube. If the artery ruptures, you can bleed severely.        * Ectopic pregnancy is usually found in the first 5-10 weeks of pregnancy.    hope this helps..best wishes and keep your head up!|`|kZFov1x6aa	Im not a doctor but i highly doubt it would be ectopic.. i have heard they're EXTREMEMLY painful and im sure if you were 7 weeks they'd be able to see it on the ultrasound. If anything it sounds like your having a miscarriage .. but the ultrasound showed no baby... even at 7 weeks you can see something on an ultrasound.. it looks like a peanut. Maybe your not pregnant and just have your period.. idk ! hope it all works out ok for you|`|OBgqkkqlaa	The same exact thing happened to me in November. I miscarried at five weeks. I started bleeding and was scared so I went to the ER. They didn't see anything in my uterus. They said my uterus looked like my period was coming. Later I passed small clots. My doc was worried that it could be an ectopic, but she didn't want to do surgery on me for nothing. Just to be sure, I had to get my blood drawn every two days to have my levels checked. They were dropping fast. Turns out I miscarried. I'm not a doctor, but your situation sounds alot like mine. I think you just miscarried. But remember, if your bleeding too much, get really bad abdominal cramping, or really bad shoulder pain, then you should go to the hospital. Those are signs of an ectopic. And you're still getting positive pregnancy tests because your hormones are still way beyond what it takes to make a home pregnancy test positive. If you try one again in a few weeks, it should come back negative. Good Luck and I hope everything is okay.
QXSFpMzDaa	I tried it and it binded my daughter up really badly and gave her gas.  She just wasn't doing well with it.  I switched her to Similac and she never had issues again.  Every baby is different!|`|AA11210211	Good start is all I used with my children it is all they gave me on WIC in Oklahoma,they did well on it,I tried enfamil with both and it always made them gassy and fussy.My daughter is now on Similac because that is what Texas gives on WIC and she is doing good on it.I also tried the Parents Choice formula for my daughter for a few weeks when I didn't have WIC and that one was okay too:)|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My daughter did good on Similac Soy, and I tried to switch her to Good Start Soy, because WIC told me it was the same, she did horrible.  She eventually had to be put on Similac Alimentum, so it didn't matter anyway!  But all babies are different.  I have a friend that swears by it, and wouldn't use anything else, but I won't use it at all.  I have heard that babies do need to have to be fed more often on it, and this amongst other things, was something I noticed!|`|XOtOMncwaa	My son used good start from day one, it's what they gave him at the hospital, and it agreed with him, so I just stuck with it. I figured there was no sense in changing it. And I never had any problems with it whatsoever, and I was thankful that he agreed with it after I looked at the prices of other brands!|`|Q3xUM68jaa	Yes my 4 month old is on good start soy. She likes it. no problems|`|4d4bc6d418e7f55703a46a017910893caa	I use it as a supplament to the breast milk and my daughter loves it. I dont find it makes her more gassy. The enfimill and similac and she was more gassy and fussy. I think every baby is different though.    Good Luck to you!
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I breastfed all three of my kids.  I got my period back at 6 months with my first, 11 months with my 2nd, and 12 months with my 3rd.  Some people get their periods back fairly quickly, and others go a year or more.  Enjoy your break!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I was actually a little over 11 weeks.  The night before I came on and asked the exact same question, and someone told me not to worry, and that it would come back with a vengeance, so be glad it's not yet.  And the very next day it did, and boy did it ever, lol!!    OOPS, I just came back and reread the question, and I don't breastfeed, so I guess I don't count!!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	6 weeks pp with both kids. But I've heard some women go months, up to a year or so without.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I was at 6.5 weeks when I got it. I was pumping so I think that is why I got it so early.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I breastfed my daughter for 9 months and didn't get my period back until about 1.5 months after she was weaned.    I breastfed my son for 18 months and didn't get my period back until about 2 months after he was weaned and even then it wasn't regular even 9 months after he was weaned.  Then I got pregnant again so it never really returned to normal.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I got mine around 8 or 9 weeks after giving birth|`|74pfB2Bnaa	I got my first period, a very light one, almost 10 months after giving birth. I'm still breastfeeding, just not quite as frequently as before.|`|bL3rzrEYaa	I breastfed (pumped) for 3 months, and once I stopped, it took me a little over a month to get my period. And it was so so heavy (sorry TMI I know lol). But I believe it is a little different for everyone. It will come  :o)  If you are concerned call your OBGYN they should be able to tell you something.    Congrats new mama  :o)|`|073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	My daughter is 5 months old and there's still no sign of it. I should be home-free at least until she gets going with solids. Another reason to say ... Yayyyyy for breastfeeding!!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I exclusively breastfed for 4 months, then had to go back to work, so I breastfed 3 times a day, and pumped twice a day.  Even with the pumping, I didn't get my period until my baby was 6 months old.  My sis didn't get hers until she weaned her baby at 10 months.  She breastfed exclusively, with no pumping.|`|3b3ff67447b873310e5ad46c73b2e37baa	not till 5 months after the birth.

AA12362998	Explain to your husband why you're not ready to have another child. Talk to him nicely so he will understand. Yes, it shows that you love him so much but you have to love yourself, too. Give your husband a time frame on when do you want to have another baby. I know your husband will understand you. He loves you.|`|k8aqLa5gaa	Well, firstly, you should talk to your husband about your problem or situation. Communication is the key. I can see his point in this as well, though, but did you know a woman can only have conception or get pregnant 2 time in 1 month. So, I wouldnt worry if you didnt use a protective barrier for you intercourse. But, if you feel that unsafe about it just talk to him and let him know. Enjoy! Give in! You probably won't regret it!|`|F0d1bOxgaa	If you want one then yes do it but if not. No. He will understand if he loves you. And good for you for wearing protection! Make sure that your daughter knows if you are thinking about having a second or third child.     Talk to her and ask if she thinks it would be cool to have a younger sibling. If you want one feel....Give your husband a deadline though so that you can prepare yourself for what is coming.    Also, tell him or try to explain how much it hurts to have a child and see how he would feel.     Good luck, and do what you feel is right. Trust your gut feeling!|`|QKGuNLb4aa	i think you need to talk to your husband about why he wants to start ttc right now and why it would hurt to wait till june. and you also need to be able to tell him reasons why you want to wait till june. also if it were me i would ask him what other need i  hadn't satisfied.  i really hope that it all works out for you.|`|45rhPO3oaa	Don't do it if your not ready if he loves you he will respect your decision if not hes just wants to without protection because its feels better without one thing you have to understand is do you really want to bring a kid in this world its bad now and when he or she is 20 what is this world going to be like is it going to be a place you want your kid to be in 20 years my advice is No not only the population but wars and money are we even going to be able to go outside ozone bad already weigh the pros and cons be responsible its you life maybe ask god for the answer|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	you expect someone to read all of that? I know im not gonna bother reading 3 different questions to answer one, waist of my time, keep it short and keep it simple youll get more answers|`|AA10802202	The desire to have children is normal. However, it requires so much more on your part-- you not only have to birth the child, you have to carry it for nine months, you have to take time off work, you have to deal with baby kicks, and hiccups, and back pain... the list goes on. Should you satisfy the needs of your spouse? Yes. Should he take into consideration that you satisfying his needs requires more physical effort, for a longer period of time, than him satisfying yours? Absolutely. Have children, sure, but waiting until June is not at all unreasonable. Have him wear protection. Don't let him pressure you into having a child-- that is not good for you, your marriage, or your baby/babies.|`|kZFov1x6aa	honestly.. if your not ready then dont. He has to understand the toll it takes on a females body to carry a child and it can be quite traumatic mentally not just physically. stand your ground !|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Tell him to swallow a watermelon whole and try and **** it out, see how it feels lol. Nah jk if your still not over the pain from your first kid then just wait, time will heal and eventually you will be ready again :)|`|tj6MgJujaa	THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.  IF YOU'RE NOT READY THEN HE SHOULD RESPECT THAT.  AND DON'T BE PRESSURED INTO GETTING PREGNANT.   BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE DEALT WITH IN YOUR HOME. NOT ONLINE.  BUT YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT. I MEAN A DETAILED, LONG CONVERSATION.  AND I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T BE SCARED.  JUST BECAUSE YOUR FIRST PREGNANCY WAS A BAD EXPERIENCE, DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE SECOND ONE IS GOING TO BE BAD TOO.AT LEAST NOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.  GOOD LUCK.|`|np58wJjsaa	well i think he can wait itll june. just stick it out till then and you guys will be just fine. its a compromise. he gets another baby and you don't have to have one right away. and let him now that. marriage is all about take and give.|`|29mqrzoQaa	well if you have 3 no more kids but if you have one or two it gould be a good thing
a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	My son was born 6 weeks early so at 7.5 months and although he was small (4lbs 4.5oz) , he was perfectly mature and didnt even go into the NICU. His lungs and heart and everything was good, he just had a slight case of jaundice. I looked it up online and at 34 weeks the survival is 96%, I believe 32 weeks or 7 months was around 92%.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	The chances become greater as you get further along, and I believe they would really want to to make it to 32 weeks, but yes at 28 weeks a baby can survive, they consider the baby viable at 22 weeks, meaning it could be able to survive out side of the womb.  But it isn't 100% at this time.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Many are born at 7 mos gestation and do survive.  However, it's an uphill battle.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	ive seen baby's that were born sooner than that & have lived!! i hope all goes well 4 u hun xx|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My doctor said that the 24 week point is where they can save a baby.  We have an excellent hospital, so after I hit 24 weeks she wasn't even worried.  So it depends a lot on the technology and things available at your hospital, because those first minutes are crucial at that age.  23 w 6 d is the latest you can have a miscarriage.  After that it is called a "still birth", so it is at that point that theoretically they could survive.|`|2G2KBV1Qaa	Yes! My baby was born at 26 weeks she weighed 1lb 11oz...she is now 5 weeks old and weighs 2lb 11oz...she is very strong!....she does have small episodes of apnea ( forgetting to breath) but they only last about 5 sec at the most, her brain is fine, she doing great!....they she will be in the nicu until or near my due date. Think postive...I was told i most likely won't here my baby cry after i deliver her and she cried!....my niece was born at 7 months and she is 20 yrs old...my nephew was born at 32 weeks and he is 2 yrs old...Good Luck!|`|bL3rzrEYaa	With all the advances we have had, I do believe she would survive. Sometimes they do not, but at that gestational age the probability would be very good that she would be fine. If you are concerned speak to your OBGYN and he/she will talk to you about that chances of that happening and what could happen. My daughter was born at 8 months (34 weeks approximately) and she was only 4 lbs, but she didn't need help breathing or anything and she got to come home within a week. However, they knew I was going into premature labor at 33 weeks when I was having bad contractions, so I was given Magnesium treatment to stop my contractions, and steroids for the baby's lungs to develop faster. The only probably my daughter has had, is at 3 months old she had RSV so we spent 4 days in the hospital.    The better the baby stays in there (closer to 40 weeks), the better. However, they consider you full term at about 37 weeks. I have the book What To Expect When You're Expecting, and it was my Bible for the 8 months I was pregnant. I know it is kind of late in your pregnancy to get it, but if you know anyone who has it borrow it, or I believe you can get it from the library. It's wonderful and tells you so much you want to know about your pregnancy. But just remember, if something feels weird or you are worried, go to your OB right away, better to be safe than sorry. I didn't know I was having contractions right away, and when I finally couldn't stand the pain anymore I went to the hospital, and they told me that due to complications in my pregnancy, if my water would have broke they would have had less than 10 mins to get my daughter out (b/c she was separated from her cord). I lost her twin at 21 weeks, and he was still in me and so that was also causing complications, needless to say a very difficult pregnancy.    good luck sweetheart, congrats on your pregnancy!|`|dwdLkvgPaa	My mom had my at 6 and half months pregnant 29 years ago and I am doing well..I was very small 3lbs 1oz and I had to be in the hospital for almost 4 months back then...
a12cbnR4aa	It will spike when you've ovulated, not sure about your period.
j73bqzRAaa	omg  i have the same problem  i think its really best  when my boyfreind rubs my back and i learned the more i do in the day the more it hurts so make sure shes not  doing too many things and running all around|`|7UVJe31Taa	she should try sleeping with a pillow between her legs. I don't knnow how far along she is, but I had to sleep with a pillow under my belly too. They make wedges for your belly. Oh, and of course you should massage her as much as you can:) (lucky girl)|`|6ITgXvBWaa	A massage chair.|`|4c0lcJReaa	YOU CAN GIVE HER A MASSAGE (BUT MAKE SURE SHE IS SITTING UP)OR TAKE HER TO A MASSAGE THERAPY PLACE THAT ALSO SPECIALIZES IN MASSAGING PREGNANT WOMEN. IF YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES OR WILL VISIT. EMAIL ME AND ILL GIVE YOU MY MOMS BUISNESS ADDRESS. SHES THE BEST. WHEN I GOT A MASSAGE FROM HER WHILE I WAS PREGO IT HELPED A LOT BECAUSE I WAS IN A LOOOOOT OF PAIN. IT RELAXES YOU AND THE BABY BECAUSE IF THE MOM IS NOT TENSE OR STRESSED YOULL HAVE A HAPPIER BABY.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	She could try chiropractic care and/or massage therapy. Those two things have helped me tremendously, much more so than any of the other things you mentioned.
GYoNyoWtaa	Plainly speaking an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. It can happen naturally, while the embryo is developing, which is more commonly known as a miscarriage, or spontaneous abortion. An induced abortion is when the woman decides that she does not want the baby and then has the fetus or embryo removed from her body either surgically or medically.     As I mentioned before there are two ways to terminate a pregnancy, surgically and medically. In a medical abortion a woman can either take the drugs Methotrexate and Misoprostol, or the drug commonly known as RU-486 (Mifepristone) and Misoprostol. Methotrexate inhibits the growth of developing cells and Misoprostol contracts the uterus in order to force out the pregnancy. (10)Different statistics say different things as to how long the actual abortion takes. Around 50-80% of the women abort on the same day that they take the Misoprostol. ((1, 10))     The RU-486 Pill, or Mifepristone is a steroid hormone invented by Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu in 1980. The drug is named after the pharmaceutical company that Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu works for, Roussel-Uclaf. The pill works by binding progesterone (which is needed to complete the process of a pregnancy) in the woman's uterus and therefore inhibiting it. This causes the lining of the uterus to break down and then the woman begins to menstruate. With the combination of RU-486 and the Misoprostol statistics show that about 95.5% abortions are successful. (3)    If for some reason a medical abortion does not work, a woman has the option of getting a surgical abortion. There are a number methods or procedures that a woman can go through, depending on which stage of her pregnancy she is in. Manual Aspiration is usually done in the early stages of a woman's pregnancy (from when she first knows she is pregnant to about 10 weeks after your last period). (1)The surgeon sucks the embryonic tissue out of the uterus with the aid of a syringe. (10)Another procedure is known as Vacuum Aspiration. The surgeon numbs the cervix and then expands it. The surgeon then inserts a hollow plastic tube in the hole and empties the uterus. (1, 10)The procedure used during the second trimester of a woman's pregnancy is known as Dilation and Evacuation. The woman must come to the clinic for two days in order to successfully complete this procedure. During the first day the woman's cervix is expanded by inserting a sterile fiber which absorbs the moisture in the body. Once the cervix is expanded the procedure is finished by the use of suction and forceps. A procedure used mainly in the third trimester and for "doomed pregnancies" is known as Dilation and Extraction. The procedure keeps the woman's cervix intact by keeping the opening small. The fetal head is then disintegrated and then passed through the cervix. Dilation and Curettage (D&C) is not really used any more for aborting unwanting pregnancies anymore. It basically involves scraping the wall of the uterus with a curette to disengage the placenta from the uterus. (2, 10) Finally there is a procedure called Induction in which a saline solution is injected into the amniotic fluid which the fetus injects. (2, 10)One of the websites I looked up said that this in turn poisoned and burned the fetus to death (2)and the other one that I looked up (which was an online clinic) was not clear on what happened after the fluid was injected into the body. (10)So because I am not sure what exactly this does and I do not want to make any assumptions as it was hard enough for me to write this paper on a completely factual basis.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	If you want to know what they really do then this is not the place to ask honestly.  Peoples views on abortion are deeply personal and people find it hard to answer a question about this without making it personal, especially here.    i suggest googling it and then trying to weed through the propaganda that BOTH sides spew.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	There are detailed descriptions if you look up abortion on http://www.wikipedia.org/ and I think on http://www.plannedparenthood.org    Normally with a surgical abortion they dilate the cervix and gently vacuum out the contents of the uterus.    Harriet|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Here- read this.  There is too much to type, but it tells you all of the methods.      http://www.prochoice.com/abort_how.html|`|ry3yUnoaaa	You don't want to know. Its sickening. Use protection at ALL times no matter what.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Well here is what happens to the baby.  in early pregnancy they insert a tube and section the baby up by pulling it's limbs off and disemboweling it and crushing it's skull then sucking it out.  As the baby gets older they insert a saline solution by removing much of the amniotic fluid and replacing it with saline with the baby drinks in and it burns the baby to death from the inside and also burns the skin.  Some babies are born alive and are either put in a corner to die or suffocated to death or just thrown away and left to die in the garbage with the other dead babies.  Partial birth is when they are in third trimester and they turn them till they are breech and then induce them until they are born up to the head.  They then insert scissor into the back of the head and suck the brains out which collapses the skull and then they remove the body|`|Dhsyroekaa	They go up there and prick it with a needle then use a vacuume to suck it out.  Dont ever get one, it messes you up emotionally|`|PLK1p8cUaa	There are many sites that explain this procedure in detail but basically they take an instrument and insert it into your vagina and the uterus and suck out the contents with a special vacuum.  If all does not come out then they take another instrument and scrape the rest out.
BO3KBsPIaa	My bump was small as well, and the babys estimated weight was low all the way through my pregnancy, and i had extra scans to check that she was growing ok. The doctor thought she'd be underweight..... and i was shocked when i gave birth to a 10 pound 2 baby! I was VERY shocked, beleive me! Dont worry to much about it, you may just have good tummy muscles! One week isn't anything to be stressed about, listen to the doctor.    Welcome to the world of motherhood, worrying all the time!|`|AA10217438	relax...pregnancy is not an exact science. I always measured different then my due date.   enjoy your pregnancy.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	Yep, totally normal.  I'm 37 weeks, but only measuring at 33-34 weeks. They just sent me for an U/S and the baby is actually more toward the bigger side.  Also, my sister is 35 weeks and today she measured 29 weeks, she also had an U/S and her baby is normal and healthy and growing.  Just depends on your body type. We both have longer torsos so we don't show quite as much.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	Pretty much everyone who has ever been pregnant.  Towards the end of pregnancy measurements like this are pretty inaccurate.  Don't worry about it.|`|p3d3E75oaa	it could be you conceived late, anything between 2 weeks ahead and 2 weeks back is ok|`|ghUExPxgaa	i measured 32 at 34 weeks and i know my dates are spot on as its ivf, midwife said all is good, as long as its grown since your last measurement. It could be the way the baby is lying too my midwife said. 1cm is not far off anyways, i say everything is just fine : )|`|kZFov1x6aa	your dates could be a little out .. genetics have taken over now so your baby may just be a little smaller, particularly if its a girl .. you usually stick to the original due date you were given because after a certain amount of weeks genetics takes over and babys grow at different rates. A week out is nothing to be worried about.
K5TrkUhCaa	I got pregnant with my third when my second was 8 months old and I feel like this baby will come a little earlier (I'm 36 weeks along now), at least that's what I'm hoping for lol.

Tu9S1WaNaa	Is the blood from your urine or uterus?  You should not have blood in your urine.  If it is coming from your bladder, it is abnormal. Even if it is from your uterus, I don't think that you should still be bleeding.  You probably should go to the ER if you are still bleeding or if it is from your bladder.  Have someone drive you to the ER, just to be safe.  The ER will do the blood work, too.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	you are losing WAY too much blood!!! hence the light headedness. GO TO THE ER NOW!

My first symptom was a lot of cramping and a lot of back pain.  Come to find out, the baby actually implanted itself near my back.. no wonder!  It's possible it was just slight bleeding from having intercourse too.|`|2QFe7onpaa	First of all, don't have unprotected sex.  Second, get a pregnancy test from the store or go see your doctor. You can have bleeding between your period due to stress or hormones. But seriously, get on the pill.|`|4c0lcJReaa	you can become pregnant anytime. every body is different when it comes to pregnancy. when i was prego i was still having my period for about three months before i found out. only difference was that it was shorter than usual. a lot of discharge can mean different things but the best way to find out if your pregnant is to just test yourself. the .99 cent store pregnancy test works if your on a budget. just get 2 to make sure. good luck in whatever you want your choice to be!|`|4ca7cbc3cf438ff2c043a82b2b46730caa	It's extremely hard to tell due to the variances in the behavior of womens' bodies and all that...I'm sure you know this already.    What I'm responding about is the fact that you're behaving this way and expecting to get away with it.  The result of ME thinking this way is 3 years old and the cutest little guy you ever saw.  He's the light of my life.  But if you don't want a little light in your life...change your method.    Good luck!

AA12221392	I have three kids at home as well- 17,13,9     Two of the kids leave on the weekends to go to other parents house so my oldest gets a few more.     I rotate the chores, maybe one does 3 things one day, while the next they may do one bigger chore.     I also have days off for them - where dad and I do the chores (hey everyone deserves a day off )    It would help if you posted the list of chores , we could give you better help|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	you can always switch the things out each week . like say that you have child 1 doing the dishes vacuming and cleaning a room then you have child 2 feeding the animals ( dont know if you have animals ) cleaning another room and dusting THEN the next week u swap|`|zXCFGPhOaa	What do they need to do?

ghUExPxgaa	when the egg is fertilized it takes 3-5 days to fully implant, so you may (or may not) experience slight cramping and spotting. Then it takes a few days for hcg levels rise enough to cause effects such as nausea, sore boobs, dizziness etc, so maybe a week and a half after conception you would notice theses things, but then not everyone experiences any symptoms at all|`|UaL28atDaa	You might have had some implantation bleeding - that's a little bit of spotting right after the fertilized egg implanted in your uterus. Other than that, most of the other real signs (missed period, for example) happen later on.    To get a sense for some of the things to look out for, check out this video:    http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|7AYnWg3paa	there will be no symptoms and of course its too early to test......there is not much going on this early....wait till u miss a period then test|`|c3WJMgA1aa	Yes.

You need to get a pregnancy test immediately.|`|j73bqzRAaa	am 18 and pregnat  i no how u feel ..  you  should take a pregnacy test  or go to ur gyn to be sure he/she will take blood  thats the most accurate  but those are singns of pregnacy  and i was really thirsty too but sometimes u could be pregnat and sill have ur pd.  or u could  just be stresing  and ur pd.

Those are all signs of pregnancy, but could be signs of other things as well.    Take a home pregnancy test, or go get a blood test done to be sure.|`|k8aqLa5gaa	Well, all of these symptoms doesnt mean that you are pregnant. It could mean that your body preferily your uterus is trying to produce another egg to release in your next cylce or period. Usually, people recall tenderness of the breasts and weird color discharge. This is all that happens when your body is letting you know about Tom coming into town. But, if you think youre pregnant try taking a pregnancy test.
VudhjHi2aa	It's defiantly safer!    I get a lot of crap from people on here about spanking...But call me old fashion but that is how I was raised and I thank my parents that they did. It was never done out of anger always out of love and i knew that growing up and I know that now. And I deserved it growing up.    I am not saying to beat your kids but a tap on the bottom or the hand is all good in my book.

Don't worry :)|`|cG80UU5Waa	It's normal. When my baby was born, my godmother told me that she leaked for a few years after she stopped nursing if she heard a baby cry.    I would just make sure to wearing nursing pads if you plan to be around babies or are out with your daughter, just to avoid embarrassment.|`|6Knhikr1aa	LOL I'm on my SIXTH YEAR of breastfeeding between all my kids and I've never stopped leaking!

She might not be tired.  I dont like the crying it out method myself.  I would stay with her for a while, Dont talk just be there, she might need her mommy for some reason or another, if you feel she needs to be held, thre is nothing wrong with that.  It could be just a phase and if she was a good nite time sleeper before she will most likely go back when she gets over this.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	Create a bedtime tradition, read to her, comfort her, rock her... Maybe a fun night light?    She is still very young, needs her mommy, comfort, and security. Don't read too far into this. I have 6 children, all of which go to bed on their own but 1, my little boy needs mommy at bedtime. No question about it, it is snuggle time, he cherishes it and so do I... You will never get this time back, take advantage of her needing you :) My oldest is 10 now my youngest will be 3 next month... They grow so fast!|`|F0d1bOxgaa	Try a nightlight and see how that helps. Also, make sure she is not watching any scary or disturbing shows if she is that young.     Make sure that there is nothing in the room that might be causing this. Also, check with your doctor if you feel that it will\might continue.     My daughter used to be scared of going upstairs by herself when she was 10. She still is at 12 but getting better.    Try to comfort her and see what she does if you hold her. The bedding might be uncomfortable also. Make sure when this happens that there is nothing hurting her. Try playing soothing music and see if that helps. Try comforting her. They need some type of routine and not completely random. Reading and snuggling might help as well.    Warm milk, a nightlight, and music might help. Good luck and god bless.    If you live in a "bad" neighborhood or around one think if she has seen anything that might be causing it. Some people have night terrors and wake up screaming, this happens when they are stressed.
tDaU7eYXaa	Spend time with him. Play games. This way you can work off that stress and give him attention that he needs. All kids want attention. Just don't get all mushy on him. Go down to the park and play sports. Work out with him. Give him a building project then smash it down together. You are his role model. Whenever you get the chance, tell him how stupid you were. Speak the teen language and fire it up with curses to get him listening. "I made a f***ing stupid mistake! I was so **cking retar*ed." BLAH BLAH BLAH. Just do something naughty every once and a while to make sure he doesn't think you're "weak"
GYoNyoWtaa	You are probably bloated due to the birth control, although I would recommend for you to go ahead and take another test.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Take another test for starters.  The "bulge" may just be the effects of the pill because technically, the pill makes your body think that you are pregnant already which eliminates the need for your body to release an egg.  Don't be too worried about it.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Well you're probably gonna have to take another pregnancy test to be completely sure...good luck with everything|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	You're probably bloated from the hormones in the pill.    Even IF you did get pregnant at Christmas, the bulge wouldn't show up for another month or so.  You would also have other symptoms - fatigue, nausea, etc.     Take Pamprin that has an anti-diuretic that will help you lose any water weight.  That and watch your salt intake.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I'm not saying you aren't pregnant bc I have no crystal ball :)  But you would not be "showing" this early. Not even if you got pregnant at Christmas. Women don't show until they are about 4-5 months. The uterus is still tucked behind the pelvic bone and you can not see it or feel it until at least the 13th week. Then it is just barely above your pelvic bone not near your belly button. So what you are seeing is NOT from pregnancy.  Sounds like you are just bloated. Birth control pills can cause that. So can pregnancy, but the fact that you had a negative test and a full period for a week, pretty much rules out that you got pregnant at Christmas. You were on birth control when you had sex on the 30th. The only thing you can do is wait and see if you miss a period this month and take a test if you do. I HIGHLY doubt you are pregnant though..just paranoid :) Good Luck!!
uSsmriwWaa	A vaginal probe is how they do an early ultrasound. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing to worry about. They will put a wand into your vagina to see that the embryo looks normal. At 5-6, you may not see anything. I went at 5 weeks, 6 days and saw nothing. I was so nervous, but the next week I went back and everything was fine. You will see a sac and you may or may not see a little blob inside the sac. It's possible that you could see the heartbeat flickering. Please don't panic if you don't see anything, that's normal. You will be asked a lot of questions regarding your health and the health of your partner. The doctor will do a pap smear if you haven't had one in the last year. He will also do an internal exam. You will have your weight, blood pressure, and pulse checked. They will probably do a breast exam, too, and listen to your heart. They will also do a lot of blood work to check for underlying diseases and to check your hormone level again. It will be thorough! The doctor will tell you what not to eat and any other instructions you need to know about. You will have a chance to ask any questions. The whole thing could take up to 45 minutes. Just relax and now that the exam is to ensure that you and your baby are healthy. Congrats and good luck!|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Well at mine they did a pap and pelvic exam|`|4GnzqUxzaa	I'm pretty sure the "vaginal probe" thing is called a trans vaginal and no it doesn't hurt they only stick it in you maybe an inch it gets uncomfortable at times but its basically an ultrasound.|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	You can take Tylenol...  They will do a vaginal sonogram and no, it doesn't really hurt. They might do a pap smear too; I can't remember.|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	At my first appointment I was disappointed b/c I didn't get to see the baby on Ultrasound but I did get to hear the heartbeat (But I was a few weeks farther along than you).    Other than that my doctor ordered a ton of lab work/ blood tests, that I had done the same day, I had a pap smear and pelvic exam (yeah I have to agree it was very uncomfortable...you can take Tylenol). I also had to take a urine test. I filled out a TON of paperwork giving my family history as well as my fiance's history as well as my personal history. My blood pressure and weight were also taken.|`|j73bqzRAaa	i no i cant stand paps and yes they will do one  i had to have the vagnal probe too it kinda hurts  but not as bad as that meadel **** they shuve up there once a yr lol  but you will be so cought up in ur baby on that ulrasound screen  and seeing him or her for the 1st time  u wont care about that thing  i think the pap hurts more than that  but you can take tylonol  its the only thing pregnat woman can take  also expect to get ur weight and blood pressure and heart rate also ur gonna have to get bloodwork done  thats the worst part   i got 6 tubes  done  dont forget to drink alot of water b4 you go because that helps  the doc see the baby more and also helps blood flow  faster  good luck|`|GRZE6Cu4aa	you should take a nap befoer hand, that always makes me ffel goodz.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You can take Tylenol. I have had 3 vaginal ultrasounds done and it isn't painful. Just a little uncomfortable. The reason they are doing a vaginal is bc you are too early to see anything with a tummy ultrasound. You may even be too early to see anything with the vaginal u/s. I had to have 3, each a week apart, before they could even see or hear a heartbeat. They will probably do a pap and pelvic exam at the office and schedule you for the ultrasound. (unless they have the equipment in the office)  Don't worry, you will be fine :) Good Luck!!!|`|YspTfI8Faa	I had a pap and vaginal sonogram. I was nervous too but all it was was her swabbing something then this smooth, cold, skinny thing went in...it tickled a bit but you get over it when you see your little baby on the screen.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	yeah they go through family history probably a blood test just relax if they do an internal which they probably wont but if so it just there fingers in there not the clamps or anything i was told they don't do pap smears while your pregnant   good luck and congrats|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	they will do a pap. and check you out . take blood . have you take a urine pregnancy test . weight blood pressure .then to find out how far along you are they may do an ultrasound . its a stick that goes in you vagina the first time when you start getting further along its on the belly|`|sI0HbV68aa	They will do a physical exam.  It's still to early to get a heartbeat...that usually comes around 8 weeks.  Get used to it...you'll have a lot of examinations from here on out.  You'll get to where it doesn't bother you that bad..I promise.
SnanuNKiaa	it might have been a bad test. if you had 3 positives, i would go to the dr and ask for a blood test, because if you've had a positive, then its a positive. congrats. go see the doc, they can give you an official nod.|`|i69nprxXaa	Well I have a 7 wk old daughter and before I found out I was pregnant I took two tests real cheap ones at first and got a faint positive line as well. I took a Clear Blue that says pregnant are not and it said pregnant. I went to the Dr. to confirm this and indeed I was pregnant. Congrats to you because I believe you are pregnant....|`|dHpnu8iaaa	use your first morning urine.. it will have the best results do to your body storing its hcg levels|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    you have had a few positives already. And faint or not faint its a positive pregnant!!    i would redo one in the morning. you may drunk to much water and diluted the pee so it reads faulty or neg.    god Bless x
F8iyUqJBaa	I started showing at about 8 weeks.  YES, absolutely you can have a VBAC.  It is so much safer than a repeat C-section.  There is so much danger in have repeat major abdominal surgery and if you have a non- intervention birth where you are able to move around and avoid medication you will have a wonderful VBAC.  You may have to fight for it.  I would suggest going to a midwife though.  They are so much more knowledgeable and so much safer when it comes to VBAC.  The main reason doctors don't like to or wont do VBAC's is because their insurance won't allow them to because there is a .05% chance of a uterine rupture, but the reason for that is the medication that is given to "speed along labor" is what causes uterine rupture.  Don't let anyone lie to you about the fact or scare you into a repeat C-section.  Those are what are dangerous.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	my friend was showing around 8 weeks|`|X2G8EHBlaa	i showed the same time i showed with my first and yes u can have a vbac just depends what your doctor thinks|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	showing is really to do wiht your body type|`|1QLp7iC5aa	The amount of time between your two pregnancies may be a problem, talk to your doctor about it for sure, but they call them " V-BAC "'s which stands for vaginal birth after cesarian . And yes, with your second pregnancy you do usually show much much earlier than your first, its as if your body remembers how it should shift weight around! Good luck on your pregnancy!|`|ghUExPxgaa	i was 7 weeks pregnant when my son was five months old too and i started showing alittle by 9 weeks, with people making comments that i was showing, probably cos my muscles were still loose from the first!! Probably you will have to have a c-section again as it will probably be too close between babies for it to have healed enough, but if you are really determined, just talk to your midwife/doctor about it. Goodluck!!|`|1baaf1590b68ac256de6d448c39d1c92aa	i started showing at 25 weeks with 1st and 25 weeks with 2nd
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You should check back with your Dr....|`|pwu9xzF8aa	bright red bleeding after a baby can be a sign of retained products- especially if it stopped then started again. I bled for two weeks, then it stopped, then a week later i was bleeding bright red. I had a clot left behind.  go and see your GP- it could be retained placenta, or your body could just be taking longer to heal!! congrat's on your bub|`|KqloS80maa	they say its normal but after my daughter i had her vaginally i only bled at most for maybe 2 weeks like heavy then it lightned and stopped maybe a week after that ...i then got my first period 6 weeks after i had her to the date ....so my advice would be to atleast call ur doctor ....if not schedule an appt.|`|XntSwYezaa	its normal...     did you get the shot? because that could be the cause of the bleeding!!  that happened to me and i though something happened but the DR told me it was from having the shot!!!    EDIT:     then i would go to the dr... you might need a D&C(as my gma says dust and cleaning lol). have you had you 6 week check up yet?|`|T8zPA3FJaa	I bled 6 weeks pp .. had 1 week off then got my period. if you're worried though see ya doc|`|SRzswqTeaa	Haven't you gone in for a six week check up yet?  If so, what was it like then, and did they say anything?      If you are still bleeding bright red blood and it is fairly heavy, you need to be checked ASAP.  Do you notice any smell?  Fever?  It might just be that you are simply overdoing it, but it's worth checking out.  If you are just spotting here and there, and it is mostly brown, it's probably not anything to worry about.|`|YOvOb0Yyaa	Are you resting enough?  You also shouldn't be lifting anything, except the baby. I found that if I tried to lift anything (example: a basket of wet laundry) that I would start bleeding again. You really can't go back to your normal routine!  Also, I would definitley check with my doctor.
bcZSIphUaa	baby dust : )|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Keep taking those prenatal vitamins and treat your body as if you are pregnant because you very well MAY be pregnant.    I was 9 weeks pregnant when I finally got a positive pregnancy test.  That's right!  I was 5 weeks late.  So, sometimes it takes awhile for that hcg to show up.  I truly hope you are!!!!  Best of luck to you! xxx|`|lhn7aayMaa	Just keep testing and don't give up hope some women take two weeks or more to get a positive... you could always ask the doctor for a blood test.  I know waiting is easier said than done...I am two days late an have had inconclusive results and am about to lose my mind...It ain't over till AF shows up.|`|i69nprxXaa	Just test again in about a week. Because 4 neg test sounds like a sign of you not being pregnant. But just keep trying that's what I did. Good luck to you...
AA11091233	Oh God. This happened to me when I had just turned 18. It took me until my 30's to understand that this is called 'date rape'. I blamed myself. When it was over, I came to and was actually polite to him because I felt it was my fault because I went into his apartment.    I never told anyone. I stopped having any sex for 8 years!!! I buried it, even though it was like an out of body experience. I do believe he gave me the date rape drug, because I wasn' that drunk, I was paralyzed and kept coming to, all I could do was say, no, no, he was hurting me...but he kept going at it all night after he was doing cocaine.    This is NOT your fault!!! Rape is rape. If he carried you and you did not feel like this is something you wanted to do...that is rape. You need to get some sort of counseling. Unfortunately, you have taken a shower and didn't call the police etc...the main thing is to realize it was not your fault and he is a massive jerk/criminal to take advantage of you.    I would get a pregnancy test as soon as possible, I would go to my gyno and tell her/him what happened and they should test you for Std's and they can also put you in touch with someone to talk to regarding what happened.    I would also...and I don't mean this in a mean way at all....but please from now on...please don't put yourself in situations where your drinking gets out of control or where you are left vulnerable to allow a guy to slip the date rape drug in your drink.    You MUST talk to someone about this though. You are not alone. This happens all the time and it will affect your life...so please don't do as I did and blame myself and stay away from men...take care of it...and see what can be done.    I wish you the best and pray you aren't pregnant too. I'm not sure why you stopped taking the pill...but if you still intend on drinking...I'd reconsider that...and again, I don' t say it in a mean way...just a realistic way.      Take good care of you!!|`|256cVXsmaa	Oh god that is sad =[  It is sexual assault in every way. If a guy takes advantage of you while you are drunk it is ALWAYS sexual assault.  Even if you were to say yes while you were drunk it is STILL counted as sexual assault because you weren't totally conscious while performing.  It sounds like in your case it was even worse then just being a little bit drunk, you were pretty unconscious.  When did you have sex with him? is it to late to get the morning after pill...  That as*hole!! I can't believe he even did that to you...  Just remember this was no where near your fault.  I mean of course it was your responsibility and you shouldn't have gotten that drunk where you couldn't make good decisions but I mean that guy should have NEVER took advantage of you because you weren't able to make good choices.|`|eu6UQElYaa	If you have to ask, then you were raped.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	It's never your fault.  You put yourself in a dangerous position but what happened wasn;t your fault.|`|H5i8BMh2aa	I'm illegal in most states to have sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs. I guess because it's believed you can't give consent to something when your not functioning normally.    It's rape if you never gave consent.  Being half-passed out and not fighting back isn't consent.    If you didn't want it, it was rape.  And no matter what you do, it is NOT your fault.  There is no such thing as "Asking for it"    Be careful and take care of yourself.  If you wanted, you could probably call the non emergency number for the police and talk to them about it. If it's been less than 48 hours or something you can do a rape kit and get proof that he had sex with you(if he didn't use a condom) and possibly try to convict him.|`|E7LSetRHaa	No, It was not your fault. You messed up by allowing your self to be in a dangerous situation and you know that but if you were that out of it then you were taken advantage of. You need to go immediately and be checked for STD's. It will be a while before you know about pregnancy. Also you should tell you Dr. what happen because you may be able to file criminal charges. If he was aware of what he was doing it is rape. If you don't speak up he may do the same to someone else. I am sorry you went through this but if you can draw strength from it then you may be able to help someone else. Also you might consider going to a support group. Rape can hurt much deeper if you let the feelings fester. Again, I am sorry. Good luck and God bless.
256cVXsmaa	I honestly like scarlett... Haven't heard it in a while, Ava is also really cute.  Scarlett sounds like someone with dark brown hair, very cute, a bit tall, and thin, bright green eyes =]  RED LIPSTICK hahaa..    Kellan is very unique and cute also.  Sounds more like a blonde haired blue eyed little one.|`|AA10325228	Avery and Rowan|`|ZEYkDuxCaa	I really like cecilia ryanne for a little girl, and little boys I like jesse frederick and call him JF for short.  Using frederick and kellan it sounds like your wanting to kill frederick.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	Avery (Ava) ~ A girl who doesn't try too hard to fit in, is herself and proud of it.. Somebody who is nice and cares about everyone and is very emotional and loving.    Scarlett ~ Lively and entertaining, popular and a party animal who is smart.. very outgoing.. a Socialite. Street smart.    Kellan ~ handsome, friendly, intelligent, outgoing, trusworthy, and cute ;)    Overall, they're my favorites :D|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	The only name I like is Scarlett and I like it with Cecilia - Scarlett Cecilia!    Although I do not care for any of the boy's names, my favorite is Rowan.|`|SfwLF8j2aa	Love Avery! I also like Ryanne and Scarlett.Kellan is a great name.Jesse is also a really good name.Rowan is cute.Sorry..not much help lol they are all good:)|`|1bd1493adb07663501c147374a42ddc2aa	Of the girls names I only like Scarlett (and think it goes best with Cristiana). I don't care for the boys names, sorry (I like Frederick though).|`|TZjhbV2raa	Well, personally, I think the only girl name I like that you have listed would be Scarlett, and Cristiana would be a nice middle name for that! I am not too fond of the boys' names though...sorry....|`|5hb6VUglaa	I like ryanne for a gal, because it is smooth and preety. Like the name Dondda is harsh. I would picture her to be a really sweet kid that has dark hair and pale skin.      For guys....i think I like Kellan. I would picture him to be a trouble maker...popular...with braces.
XntSwYezaa	its probably all in your mind!! the doc said that in your mind you think ok its the 2nd im supposed to have my period today but you don't because your pregnant. you goes years with having a period and now you dont.. your mind has to adjust.. and your mind will get used to it when you start to show....|`|oXFVRYCsaa	yes its normal, you may feel like you have period pains alot throughout your pregnancy it is just your womb getting bigger and stretching    Good Luck|`|RJ8Jf73Vaa	I felt exactly the same.It finally stopped for me by the time I hit my 4th month. I'm not sure if it's normal but everything so far has turned out great for me and my little one(I'm now 26 weeks!) Good luck!|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	I went through the same thing all the way up until I delivered, but if you are bleeding or spotting or anything I would call your doctor.

Those are the exact same symptoms I had before I found out I was pregnant.  My nipples were sore like 3 weeks after I got pregnant!|`|X0xHXDcTaa	With my last pregnancy and my previous one I had sore breasts a few days before my period was due. It was like sharp pinching feelings. So I will pray that you are prego!! :) Go to a dr and have a blood test done!|`|WBw9lDG8aa	there could be so many symptoms of pregnancy or signs here are 15 signs of pregnancy .    1.vomiting  2.gas  3.abdominal pain  4.sore boobs  5.implantation bleeding  6.u could be trouging lots of CM  7.head ache  8.ur nipples get darker  9.swollen boobs   10.bloated  11.mild cramps in lower stomach  12.back pain  13.frequent urination  14.constipated  15.and take a HPT.    good luck i hope i helped a lil.
XntSwYezaa	i think you will be fine!!! when you miss a pill or you start taking those different color pills in you birth-control pack(mostly Sugar) it triggers your body to say its time to have your period.. so thats why when you miss a pill or two you bleed.. then when you remember and take the pills you stop!!     hope it helps but you can take a test just to make sure...|`|hHQIUrNjaa	thats like saying i have smoked cigs for years, but i didnt smoke for a couple days, but I still smoke. Am I addicted?    It makes you take pills every day to keep you in the habit of taking pills. you can miss one, as long as its not during your ovulation.|`|J7IGXYFUaa	UH OH!  don't have an abortion!   that would be stupid.|`|HIf3lvnVaa	don't buy a pregnancy test those things cost like 20$  for 20$ you can by a pizza  i don't know about you but for 20$ i could wait to see if I get fat|`|yqCyTTPXaa	Not to scare you, but that's exactly what I did and I am now prego. Shitty thing is you have to wait about a month to even be able to take a test to get an accurate result and the wait is excruciating! I would suggest taking the morning after pill if you don't want to take that chance. I think you have up to 72 hours to do so.|`|WpgEqGrvaa	The bleeding is definitely normal because for that day your body thought you were ready for your period. The bleeding you experienced was just what would have been the start of your period, but because you then took the pills the next day, you stopped it from properly starting.    You should try to keep on top of your pill, but I don't think it matters to much 'cause I forgot one once and had sex within the next few days and didn't get pregnant :)    That said there is a chance that you might be so wait and see if your period is late and get a test (sorry).

m2aznd8xaa	well when i was younger babysitting i charged 5 bucks an hour for kids that where a bit older like example they can do stuff for themselves.get a snack,put a movie on,dress themselves,can use the washroom on there own .stuff like that and if i had younger ones like if i had to prepare there meals or snacks had to take them to the washroom,if i had to spend more time entertaining them then id charge about 7-10 bucks an hour depending on how well behaved the child was. good luck and good for you on making some money.|`|b7TueUUPaa	thats a handful! when its just the little girl.. i'd say 5 or 6 dollars an hour!   but for all three anywhere from 8-10 an hour.  depending on their manners, and how good they are.|`|A5mkPwIqaa	I babysat a lot when I was younger and I would charge $4/hr for just the one kid and $6/hr for all 3, but it really depends on your experience, the kids' demeanor, and the area you're living in. Have you talked to them about it? Usually when I babysat, the parents gave me their idea of a fair rate, which I usually agreed with.

4d5481f08433b8e9d4468ca13224305baa	The best answer we can give here is...  If you have had sex, especially unprotected sex, then yes, you could be pregnant.  If you haven't had sex, then no, you are not pregnant.  Any more than that and it is just opinion, advice, etc.  Sorry, but that is the best advice you can get here.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    those symptoms seem to be pregnancy symptoms.  test when ready.    possiblity : possible pregnancy    god bless|`|GYoNyoWtaa	I guess it's a good possibility. Go ahead and take a test, and if you think that it may be to early to detect with a HPT...make a appointment at your doctor's office she can tell as early as 14 days after conception|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Lol well we dont know how can we tell you if you're pregnant? You could be tricking yourself and you could be pregnant. No one can tell you. The real answer is take a test.|`|5RoYyprkaa	You want a real answer? Take a test.  You want a guess? You could be, or, you could have ovulated later than you thought. Or it could be just a wierd period. I get interesting things with my periods that I didn't have the month before. It's the joys of being a woman. But, don't let it consume your every thought. The more you think about it, the more "signs" you will have. The best thing you can do is live like you are pregnant, and wait until your next period to arrive.|`|T8zPA3FJaa	Could just be your period coming on. There's always a possibility you are.  But seriously taking a test is a REAL answer. We are not psychic! We don't know if you are or are not.   A hpt can tell you.  A blood test at the doctor can tell you.|`|akB0gV20aa	Here is a real answer: We don't know! Wait until your period or take a test!|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Did it happen on one side or both?  A sharp pain in one of your ovaries could indicate an ovarian cyst.  They can be quite painful but they usually resolve on their own.  Sometimes they can burst which can cause some sharp pains and soreness in the area.  I had irregular bleeding a couple of years ago.  I went to the OB/GYN and she said she felt a cyst on one of my ovaries.  I was scheduled for an US the next day.  That night I had some very sharp pains and soreness.  The next day the US was negative.  My OB/GYN said she definitely felt a cyst but that the pelvic exam and her palpations of the area may have caused it to burst.  It was no big deal, but my period was off for a couple of months.  I'm not sure that this is what is happening to you but it is a possibility.
UJaCObdyaa	It is pronounced Gee-Arne    We have a famous swimmer in Australia named Giaan Rooney.  I think it is a gorgeous name.  As you can see she spells hers slightly different.  I think her spelling makes it easier to pronounce.|`|AA11138222	I would pronounce it Gee-Ann but I like Gianna better.|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I don't like it..it doesn't even look like a complete name..|`|xhVe918waa	Nooo,    But Gianna [Giana; alternate spelling]  or Gia would.|`|ouvvS1Ylaa	gee-en or gee-anne?  i would spell it gianne.   or gianna.  i like it.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Gianni, which was suggested by another, would be much better.     What you have now is a difficult-to-read version of "Jan".     Also, in the future, please, please, PLEASE do not use "u".|`|DiqDCZU4aa	I like it, or even gianni... its not common and i luv it|`|fligJAkYaa	Gianna is more feminine, Plus with Gian, you run the risk of people mispronouncing it and it coming out something like "John",
HVXtd2Ryaa	TAFE. They have a course call Adult Tertiary Preparation (ATP). It's a senior year alternative and can be done by correspondence. You do the course from home and go online or to a TAFE when you need help with something.    It combines both grade 11 and 12 into a course that takes approximately one year to complete depending on what pace you go. You don't get an OP but it is recognized by universities and jobs as a tertiary education.  I've added the tafe open learning link for you to have a look through as well.    Good luck!|`|TM3pNz6kaa	What Melanie said and also to add on that most TAFE have a child minding facility
GZqmZ8Ahaa	same with me i am glad there is someone else like me ... at my school your popular or not and guess what i am not and i am not ugly like some but i am bigger than others and i think that is way it sucks when that is the way i have to go to school everyday just try to hang out with the people on the bus or the kids that sit around you in class|`|PAjHWRhsaa	Well...I wouldn't get stressed about middle school. When high school starts, cliques change. I was in the popular group up until beginning of 8th grade and they were all b*tches to everyone so I ditched them. I was friends with everyone. I still hung out with the "popular" people. There were certain people I didn't hang out with, but I was never mean to them. I'd just start talking to people. That works wonders. Get people by themselves. Don't necessarily talk in groups. When girls are in a group they tend to follow the leader who usually will be very snobby. Just be yourself. Don't be shy. Good luck! I'm 22 and it always worked for me. Lots of friends!! Middle school sucks......people I was friends with then either moved, or changed in high school. Don't cry...don't let anyone get to you and most importantly don't let anyone know they are making you feel that way.|`|w2kofruFaa	It's because it's a small school. I've been going to them for all my life. People are just like that. When you enter high school, find the people who are most like you. In the mean time, just hang out with various people and try to associate.

That's my only solution, because I really don't know the situation.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	He can always renew it.  It's easier when he's out of the country.    You can always petition for him to get a fiance visa.    Or you can do the way of most illegal aliens and have him come to visit, stay, and then hire a lawyer to do the dirty work...|`|XhG7Jq4Taa	ask him to get a job out here in america.... or you may have to move there with him|`|1ylpCN3yaa	Where is he from?
hHSsMyNpaa	Yes if he is drinking so much that he needs to urinate every 20 minutes or so very big chance he is developing Type 1 diabetes.  This is very, very, serious.  You must get him checked out right away.  Tomorrow.  NO cranberry juice, nothing sugary or sweet at all.  This is very bad if indeed he is developing diabetes.|`|eu6UQElYaa	It depends.  If he's just recently been potty trained then yes it can be very normal.  They are excited about using the potty and want to go ALL THE TIME.        If he's been using the potty for awhile now and just started having this happen then it's more likely the result of something else.   It could be a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, a whole host of things.  In this kind of instance he should be checked by a doctor.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	no|`|WUwdDxWMaa	He might just like to flush it... My friends cousin said he had to potty just because he wanted to flush it. If he is thirsty or ravenous he could have diabetes not just if he uses the bathroom plus if he did have it he would probably pee himself and for the UTI he wouldnt be going (idiots) and he would proably tell you he was hurting down there Ive been told its painful|`|RVeLHqe9aa	im not sure if it normal but at least he is interested in the potty and maybe he will chillout on using it so much after a while..... that or maybe u should stop giving him soooooooo much to drink.....haha just joking|`|cfp93Q4Laa	Call your doctor. Sometimes frequent urinating is a symptom of diabetes. Catch it early if you can.  If there are diabetics in your family it is a strong possibility.|`|yZqRYFsPaa	maybe he drinks too much.its normal|`|RFCcWPliaa	yeah. when children are potty-trained at an early age they do not yet know when they actuallly have to go to the bathroom. where i worked as a counselor, there was a two year old named maddie who was potty trained. she did the same thing. she said that she had to go potty about every 30 minutes even when she didn't have to go. i hope i helped!|`|Gge8MNTKaa	If you child is drinking less than he is urinating, you should have your son tested by a doctor.|`|dXtzLcIwaa	he might have a bladder problem. u might need to see a dr. or to the e.r.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Oh yes very! My nephew can relate to this. He's 3 as well, and every other minute it seems he has to "pee pee". They're just excited about the new "big boy" potty.       If that's not the problem, is he actually "urinating or making bowel movement" each time he goes to potty? Or does he sit there and a tad bit comes out each time? If that's the case he may have a bladder problem. Tell your pediatrician|`|HjVjSI6uaa	kids who are just being potty trained like to use it all the time. especially because they get praised whenever they go potty. its just for attention or because they are bored or antsy.|`|qdGZMGdkaa	don't freak out and jump to the conclusion that it is diabetes. is your son new to the potty he might have a fascination with it that will be short lived. If you notice other symptoms such as irritability and constant thirst pay attention to those diabetes symptoms but prelim i wouldn't say its a problem. if it persists for 2 weeks call the ped and ask what they think.|`|GXVanwgPaa	no! get cranberry tablets he can take. it will fix any blatter trouble in about 2 months|`|ujT5teZgaa	Diabetes.|`|YxMh2aAOaa	no bladder disorder|`|PyW5xHU0aa	NOOOO. Go to the hospitale|`|UqvGKax1aa	It depends on what is normal for him. I would take him to a Dr. It could be a UTI (urinary tract infection), easy to treat once diagnosed.|`|krQpHkkwaa	Maybe he just has a quick metabolism.|`|nQ0IGtXzaa	Your Son Has IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Here is a link...      http://www.webmd.com/ibs/default.htm|`|5Hmyjr7Eaa	if he uses it him self then he might be hapy that hes a big kid|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Drinks to much or just contact a doctor.|`|wvTI2XZSaa	I wish my son would use the potty at all though hes not even 3 yet but...he totally refuses...lmao NOW it can be a sign of diabetes as stated above but do NOT think that if its the only sign. It would be hes drinking lots more or even drinking when you dont see it....it can be very simple there are other signs of diabetes as well! Just keep an eye on it if it continues or worsens then take him for a check up....|`|C8b3KsrGaa	Maybe he likes the potty, or he could be thinking he is done going when he isn't. There could be lots of things, I would bring it up with your doctor the next time you go if you are really worried about it. It can be difficult with kids. Sometimes they just wanna sit on the potty and try and push it out, other times they are drinking too much for their little tummies. Just watch for a while and see what it could possibly be and then take it from there.|`|fTQidoOFaa	There are two things that come to mind.  First, a bladder infection.  Check for signs of fever or pain when urinating.  Second, if he is just learning to use the potty, he could be trying out a new "skill".  If you are very concerned, bring him to his doctor.  In the mean time, give him some cranberry juice.  Good luck!|`|MEFsdECKaa	yea like the first person said it could be diabetes or a bladder infection but most likely not. Um I found a website on diabetes so if you need info here's the link|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	I would definitely take him/her to their doctor and have a urine test done to make sure that there is no infection found. It too depends on what your child is drinking and how much. But it sounds like a kidney infection.
A5mkPwIqaa	Don't worry, you're not a bad parent. I'm a daycare teacher myself and the biting problem happens with looots of kids. It's a natural defense for them, when they think someone is taking their possessions! I would try taking her places with lots of other kids around, so she can interact with them, but keep watch so that you can stop her if she starts to bite one of them. If she does, just strongly tell her "No, teeth are not for biting. Teeth are for food. Biting hurts," or some variation on that. You might also want to find a daycare that knows how to deal with biting, instead of simply sending her home early.|`|e92vFGEWaa	Your not a bad parent it's just that your child is having some teething pains and it most likely feels better to bite down on something. Like a dog they always need a chew toy before they are old and all their teeth are in. So if you kid was a dog i would say Get your dog a bone but since its a child i would say that you should get a item that your kid can suck on or chew on like one of those key ring rubber chew toy things but when you have a lose tooth or anything like that there is only one way for a feel better cure and that is to bite down so i would say get your kid a toy and love the kid as long as you can.         Hope this helped and sorry if i went off topic!|`|HEvSVMeVaa	I agree with Jess, I to am a toddler teacher. It really sounds like this daycare doesn't know how to handle or is just to lazy to handle the biting. I know I've had my fair share of biters and I've always found that spending a little more one one time with the new children helps, as well as allowing them to play by themselves a little bit at first and letting them warm up to the others on their own time helps.|`|MpoSGejmaa	It is spanking time.|`|xlhu4I3caa	You're not a bad parent. It's a natural urge for children to gnaw on everything in sight to test it out. Its a way of learning. Rubbing something bitter and non toxic on a life like baby doll and letting the little bugger gnaw on that and get a nasty taste in her mouth might curb her tendency. Just make sure ahead of time its somthing safe to injest.
7SKVCPcSaa	how sweet! congratulations!!    gross! thats was my first kiss. they say your first kiss is always your 'best'. nope. they are wrong. but the first kiss with my husband (when we were obviously dating) was the best kiss in my entire life!|`|H71LHyZCaa	Aw, congrats.    mine was really weird. I was eight years old and it was in a laundry mat because I just started "going out" with this kid. Just a sweet little peck. Lol, we "went out" for like 2 weeks. I kissed him a dang lot, lol. It'd be weird if i saw him now...>.|`|y3u5WYDMaa	aww congrats i wish i has my first kiss lol|`|ldN2AL1zaa	Good|`|MrNkNnhyaa	aww,how sweet!  :]  my first kiss was kinda   err   ''not so great'' lol.|`|Q101YVPgaa	I haven't been kissed yet, im 14.|`|fTpk7ospaa	It was scary at first because i was only 13 and the guy was abit of a nerd when i think back.  But when it was over and even now i think it great it was sweet and kind of perfect. for someone at age 13 anyway|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I was 5.  I don't remember.
0rpN2419aa	You have some  good answes up there.  There are chewables that have dried and ground fruits in them and the baby will not know that.  Dilute the juices a little so that the baby  does not develop too much of a dependency on sweets.  It sounds like she likes food she can chew, so continue cutting it in very small peices and put a good variety of balanced food on her plate.  Set her at the table while you are eating and let her feed herself so she feels like one of the big people and feeding herself.  I like your idea of giving the blueberries in part of her diet, wish I'd thought of that when my kids were little and when I babysat the grandkids.The blueberries  are very healthy for her. Good luck.  From your question it sounds like you are a first time mom who is very concerned about your baby getting the balanced diet she needs.  Keep up the work you are doing and her eating will come with time.  It might help if you spread out her meals to 6 times a day.   You can put her at the table with you and eat just a bit so she sees you eating.  If Daddy is taking care of her he can do the same thing.  My kids and grandkids were picky eaters so we just worked with them until we figured out what they liked and the meals were not always completely balanced, but throughout the day, they did get in a little of each of the food groups.  The most important thing is to not let her develop that little sweet tooth,  cuz believe me it will make it very difficult to get her to eat healthy foods.To be honest, even I have a sweet tooth and would prefer the goodies over the stuff that is good for us, but have learned I feel better with balanced foods.|`|m2aznd8xaa	as soon as my lttle one started on solids she ate whatever i made for dinner. i cook healthy .i dont like to fry so i bake alot.im hispanic so i cook alot of hispanic foods and my family loves my cooking. after baby is one they seen to push away all there veggies. its happened with mine too.so i made sure to give them daily vitamins and sometimes i give my 20 month old supplement shakes when i notice she aint eating well.my kids got there teeth early so i dont know how well yours can chew. but try other foods. like rice.tender chicken,fish,bakes potates. pasta thats whole grain  there are many kinds of beans and try other veggeis. good luck. and for fruits.if you want her to eat more veriety of friut  then buy v8 spash its fruity with lots of veggies in it.and juicy juice  at one they are old enough to digest more variety of regular food. i have a 9 year old and 20 month old daiughters and both are picky eaters. good luck.and even if she takes only a few bits that is okay too,as lond as dr says they are thriving.they will be okay.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Just give her the sweet potatoes and green beans and other food in  pieces she can pick up with here fingers and start teaching her  how to use a spoon. Meat is the biggest problem to find in finger foods but   things like soft finely ground meat balls and fish  cakes she could probably manage ok. My daughter hated to have someone feed  her from a very young age, she even wanted to hold her own bottle, so I just put the food in front of her and let her make a mess.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My son is 17 months old, and he's been eating basically what we eat since before his first birthday.  He was never thrilled with baby food, so we mostly gave him table food from the beginning rather than purees.    I give him small bites of meat, cooked veggies, pasta, etc.  He loves pasta!  He loves every kind of fruit -- berries, banana, oranges, apples, kiwi, grapes, pear, etc.  He's not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, or green beans, but he likes peas and corn quite a bit.  He also loves to gnaw on raw carrots, celery, and cucumber.  He eats cheese, applesauce, yogurt, peanut butter, eggs, pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, cold cereal (like Rice Krispies and Cheerios), etc.    He doesn't really like bread much, so sandwiches are mostly a no-go for him, but I can usually find something else to offer him if the rest of us are eating sandwiches for lunch or something.    Tonight, we had quesadillas for dinner (just tortillas, cheese, and leftover turkey breast), and he ate some of those along with some red peppers that I cooked for my fajitas.  We also had rice, and he ate quite a bit of that.    Maybe your daughter is ready to move past baby food and on to whatever you're eating.  Also, if you're still spoon-feeding her yourself, it might be time to give her her own bowl and spoon and let her try.      Hope that gives you a few more ideas!

The mothers of your family members have some really unusual issues with names there.  May as well call them pencil! How about eraser?

Unless he went by Shayne.
I08pH9Byaa	Remember hers is a scheduled section.  Her and baby are both okay, so all of the 'failure to progress' and emergency sections go first.  The fact that it is late in the day, in OR terminology, "To Follow", means she could be delayed if any of the surgeries run over.  I would not get too upset just yet.  You could call the nurses desk and ask to speak with someone with her family.|`|OFpl236faa	It could be that her time got pushed back because of an emergency c section or someone elses. I would try to be patient for a while longer and maybe try calling her mom again. Good luck auntie :)|`|OUVUU5xRaa	When I delivered my son (10.5) pounds via C-Section, all was said and done in about 1/2 hour to an hour.  Remember, they have to stitch her up and move her to a room and then you have the excitement of holding the baby for the first time.  Not to mention hospitals tend to move at their own pace.  Hang in there, they're probably just basking in the glow of their newborn.  I'm sure all is fine....... : )
JgpyfuuWaa	I believe you get all the Vitamin B6 you need from a pre-natal vitamin.  I've heard of some woman taking an extra supplement to aid in morning sickness.   But from what I've read, you shouldn't need an extra amount otherwise.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I tried taking B6 together with my prenatals in hope of getting rid of my morning sickness, which was excruiating (sorry for spelling). It didnt help me. So I stopped taking it. I do not think there is any other benefit if you are already taking your prenatals.|`|SHcqRRBYaa	I'm taking an additional 50 mg of B6 right now, along with my prenatal vitamin in order to lengthen my luteal phase.

yipMDefBaa	I was the same.  I have PCOS and in the year before I got pregnant I didn't have any periods unless I was taking provera.  According to my OB/GYN that it does help if you are thin.  Something to do with insulin resistance and it usually being more profound in patients who are overweight according to their BMI.    I had drug therapy.  I was put on clomid and provera with little success but metformin worked for me.  I was a on the upper limit of my normal BMI so losing a couple of kgs probably helped.      I think stressing and worrying decreases the chances.  To be honest I am pretty sure that I was on holidays when I got pregnant.  So just relax and if it happens it will happen.  There are lots of options and now in Australia you can apply for adoption even if you are getting fertility treatment.    Have a look at http://www.ovarian-cysts-pcos.com/PCOS-s...  I found this helpful because it has lots of stories of others who are going through what you are.  IT will give you more understanding, what to expect, the different treatments and also hope.    Best of luck.  I hope there will be the sound of pitter patter of little feet soon.
qkNbcWjjaa	The best advice i can give you is just relax. Its going to hurt pretty bad the first few times but after that it will start to get better.   Ask him to go slow also and then it won't hurt as bad. You might bleed a little after wards and that is normal .     Also i advise you to have him wear a condom if you guys don't want to get pregnant and make sure you get on some birth control also for your own protection. Also use Lube like Ky and it will make it easier to and not hurt as bad and then it will go in smoothly. It might take a while but just be patient and the key thing is just to relax.     Have A Safe and Happy Sex !!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Don't let him force you into having sex.  It's not a good in a relationship.  He will think he can control you.  Unless you truly want to have sex with him. . . I wouldn't go through with it.    If you truly do want to have sex. . . you may want to buy some KY jelly (lubrication) because you'll be dry down there until you become a pro and bring some pads.  You'll bleed.|`|FkStpP7Paa	well it sounds like your not ready to be with him ...and its better if you wait until your ready..if you still want to be with him just relax and tell hm to go slow and use a condom..|`|TGzOrftPaa	Um, if he's pressuring you I wouldn't.  Wait until you really want to and you're ready otherwise it can be kind of a hard thing to deal with!    That aside and you really want to make sure there's enough moisture down there when you start :)  haha.  Lube if you need to.  The first time hurts quite a bit.  It's probably not going to feel the best tonight so definitely, definitely take an ibuprofen before you start.  That'll reduce the swelling that you'll have afterwards.  Just make sure you're comfortable and take things slow.  Don't have him just jam it in because OW!|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	please tell your boyfriend to wear a condom or two tonight.

TdF6QLawaa	Yes it happened to me!    The baby was transverse up till 37+4 weeks. I worried myself sick over it. Everyone told me she would go head down at the last minute, I didn't believe them but she did!    I spent a lot of time reading with my knees on my chin and my bum in the air in the evenings, cleaning the floor on my hands and knees whilst rotating my hips. What a sight! Eventually I felt her 'flip'. I had to go for an ultrasound which confirmed she was head down.    At the very most her consultant can try manually turning the baby, but this is supposed to be quite painful and often they just flip back again. The baby is in that position because he is comfortable. He needs to decide for himself when to turn....this is often when he gets bored and decides it's time for 'action'. Sometimes the baby doesn't even turn until labour has started.    Get your friend movin' and groovin' and don't spend too much time worrying about a C-sec. A healthy mum and baby is the most important thing in the end!    Good luck!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	The baby still has time to turn tell her not to worry even if she has to have a c-sec it is not that bad and the scar is REALLY low!  I could still wear a bikini after my first child and I am prego with  2 so we shall see the toll this one takes on me! :)  Hope she does well but tell her not to worry too much...|`|Bs8sllD9aa	My son didn't turn the right way until the week I had him but some things she can do is sit and roll around on a pregnancy ball.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	of course he can turn! the baby can turn during labor, and the doctor can work on turning the baby during labor, tell you friend she has plenty of time|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	the baby can always flip before its born. magical things do happen. :o)   tell her to walk, and to talk to the doctor...there are some yoga poses that she can do as well to get the baby to flip.|`|qNHMcRL4aa	my cousin is pregnant and she said when the doctor turned he baby it turned back aain by the time she was on the bus she could feel it!!|`|AA12107422	Well, something you should always expect is the 'worse' when being pregnant. I always expected a c-section, just prepared me for the worse case senrio. Tell her not to stress so much, there isn't much you can do to 'turn' the baby at all, the baby will have to turn itself, & she still has time for the baby to turn. & If the baby doesn't turn, tell her to just look on the bright side that its the best for her & the baby, & its beyond her control. Much Luck!|`|YmLIirIqaa	The doctors can try to turn the baby at her next appt. or when it gets alot closer to her due date. It will be painful for them to do that but worth it because natural labor is healthier (to me) than c-section unless a medical emergency.|`|hoX7hoINaa	The baby will be constantly flipping around in there until he's actually ready to come out. When he's ready, he'll assume the position he wants to go.|`|1vleV1cVaa	well if she goes to the right doc everything will be well just pray|`|mc6YtaRbaa	My sister was breech at 39 weeks and the baby still turned.|`|mPIOOUtDaa	http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...|`|ec505b9bfac1af14a0ebfaeef28d6657aa	Yes the baby can still turn around. There are a few things that she can try to get the baby to do so.     One is an exercise described at this link:  http://www.wearsthebaby.com/askce/cebree...    Acupuncture is another options as described in this link:  http://acupuncture.com/news/breechbaby.h...    OBGYNs can do something they refer to as a "version" where they actually try to move the baby. It doesn't always work, it hurts and it can cause you to go into labor so it is done in the hospital.    I also found this link with other suggestions:  http://pregnancychildbirth.suite101.com/...|`|D0edZCPQaa	There is still time for the baby to turn. Also, she can try turning him on her own by going down on her hands and knees and arching her back like a cat until her pelvis is under her. Then unarch the back and repeat. Do this 10 or more times a day.  This will encourage the baby to get into the correct position for birthing. Hope this helps.|`|79rfx9gOaa	With my first pregnancy, my baby was in breech position all the way until the week before I went into labor. She just finally decided to turn over. But yes, the doctors can also turn the baby if they believe there will be a problem.
nimIHwXeaa	Ok,  you are probably feeling the *nesting* instinct, which happens before birth, this makes a woman feel like she wants to make a nice safe home for her baby.    Keep praying about the apartment, but look around and see if you can find another.    Talk to a cousin or an aunt and mention no one has planned a shower for you, maybe someone in your family will throw one for you.    Good luck!|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It will be okay. My little guy is going to be here in 5 weeks and I dont have everything ready either. I dont have his room ready, my baby shower isnt until the 21, and I havent bought much bc I wanted to wait until after the shower. It will all come together even if it feels like it wont right now. This is my first too and I am scared to death and excited to. The father is in the picture but he is gone all week every week only home on weekends so I am alone a lot in this too. But it will work out just try to stay calm. Hope this helps. Good luck and congratulations.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	don't worry. im single, 21, and carrying twins.  do you have family and friends?? if so, they are your support system.    i was freaking out like you were as well. its normal! just breathe and take it day by day, step by step. you'll get through it. also, don't worry...you have plenty of time, i know it doesnt sound like it, but you have plenty of time until your son is here. just take baby steps. make a list and just keep going right down the list getting things done! you'll get there.      good luck!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, get your butt in gear, and get the things you need!  If its money you need, time to get a job (even if it is from home), or search out some financial support from the community.  Get a place to live...or live where you are now.  If the dads not in the pic, you gotta step up, and get things done, cause the lil guy deserves to be brought into the world with a good life!!!|`|rx0ekB9Paa	im in the same boat. im due in 5 weeks,my baby shower is in 2 weeks and i am on a waiting list for a house on the other side of the country. all i keep saying is that everything will work out!!! just have faith and think about the good stuff.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Don't worry too much about all that stuff.  The main thing that you need right away is a carseat.    Are there other apartments that you could get?  Even if it was just a short term lease until you can get in where you want to.    Just buy the other stuff little by little.  One day buy one thing, then a few days later buy another thing.    You still have 2 months so you can slowly start getting your stuff ready. Do you have friends or family that could help you?    Just try to calm down and not worry too much.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I feel for you. We're in the middle of saving for our first house and getting our credit scores up. Also, it's Jewish tradition to not have showers until after the baby is born... I don't agree.     Hang in there.|`|QRWHDsL2aa	you will be fine there is plenty ov help out there gd luck x x|`|ICMaw633aa	Name Him May be donivin|`|YmLIirIqaa	I would call and check on the apartment and telling them that you are going to have the baby soon and want to be in your apt. before he arrives. I would also have his baby shower soon and then this way you will probably have very few items to buy. Dont worry, itll be okay. you still have a little bit of time but those 2 months will go by fast.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I'm in the same boat as you.  I moved in with my parents to make it easier.  Its really been helpful as far as me not freaking out because things might not be ready for him.  Thats crazy you been waiting so long for an apt.  Do you have somebody to throw you a shower?  I just had mine 2 weeks ago, and I'm 37 weeks tomorrow and I was freakin before I had it too.  Don't worry, everything will work out the way its supposed to.  Just try to be the best mommy you can be.  You sound like you'll be fine.  Good luck momma.|`|PMR7RovEaa	talk to your closest friends. they know your difficult situation better than us. first of all, we all got here because someone gave birth to us. its hard but gazillions of people have done it. don't worry. it will all be worth it in the end, when you see your beautiful baby boy. worst case cenario, if you can't get into your apatment on time, go stay with your parents or some freinds for a while. the extra help with the baby would be nice anyway. about the name...think of famous guys. like any of their names? it will come to you. you could even google "boy names", or something like that. i wish you luck!|`|xzh8r0jIaa	youll need help, im in the same boat, and shoot im not going to have a nersury ready for sure, but i dont think it takes much to care for a baby, but have your mom help if possible with a place to live, but as for having very little items you dont need much|`|Qn4X2sLHaa	I wouldn't stress to much not good for the baby! I would say that as long a you have a roof over his head and clothes to put on him and food to put in his belly than that is a good start. you don't have to have all of the new fancy items. I know a little boy named Dash and it's cute and would be kinda fitting.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Family should be helping you out. If the apartment is taking this long, I'd suggest looking for another place. You dont want to be without a place to live when this child comes along. Dont be afraid to ask someone for help. Even if you dont have much, make sure you have the basics in case he comes before you have everything. Have a carseat, a place to sleep (even if its just a small bassinet), blankets, clothes, diapers. You wont need every gadget, but be sure to have the basic necessities to get you by until you get more stuff. Try not to do everything alone, I'm sure friends, family, or someone you are aquainted with will help you for a short while.|`|PSWLs4T5aa	Well.... i think its time u started getting your stuff together! 2 months isn't alot of time, especially since your a single mother. If money is ur issue, try goodwill or once upon a child for baby stuff. As for the apartment issue, try applying for section aid or looking for a cheap place in the paper. u could also try to rent a room or stay wit your family untill u have enough money for the apt. Baby name: Tristan, that was what i was going to name my baby before i misscarried. I know your probably feeling overwhelmed but you can do it!! just do one thing at a time, good luck!
mjTmQzvFaa	When you lay your baby down for a nap, take one while the baby is sleeping. Get your baby on a regular sleep schedule with at least 1 nap a day.  Sorry but their is no excuse for what your husband is doing no matter what and don't fall into his excuses. A so called man like that, I'd be terrified to leave my child with someone like that even if it is a husband or family member. You and your children deserve 100% better and you need to believe that with your heart and soul. Don't stay with him and use the excuse you did it because of the children because that is the worst reason that can be used and pray very very hard that he never ever does anything stupid in that matter to his children because there are sickos out there and you know you would never forgive yourself if anything no matter what shape or form ever happened to your children because they can't protect themselves , but you are the mother and you can protect them.  When your baby is ready to come he or she will come to be in your loving arms and will need every bit of love like the child you have now. Good luck with your child you have now and your soon to be new born. May you be given the strength and courage to get through everything you are dealing with. May God be with you and your babies always and protect you and your babies for all loving eternity.|`|YspTfI8Faa	i'd leave him and collect child support because in my mind that's cheating...he's not helping anyway so what's the point in having him around...and this is what my whole family tells me...when the baby takes a nap, you take a nap.    Good Luck!!|`|EFc8VGwRaa	what a jerk thats just plain wrong i would get rid of him|`|5f6XnInEaa	At 36 weeks...trying to get labour going is not a very good idea at all, unless a premature, sick baby is what you want.    Talk to a doctor about pain and contractions.    Your not doing a very good job confronting your partner, I find it very hard to beleive he would so openly text like this right in front of you.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	First of all, forget about trying to bring on contractions right now.  It is WAY to early for that.  You'll just have to tough it out like everyone else.  Those sleepless nights will prepare you for what's to come.  I remember the first time I slept 4 hours straight after my baby was born.  I felt like I could have run a marathon!  Since this is your second one, you probably won't get that "rest" you're supposed to get.  No one does.  As far as the father.....GET CHILD SUPPORT!!!!
ElkcUb8Eaa	Toddler Behavior:  Nightmares vs. Night Terrors      Older toddlers and preschool age children may have nightmares or night terrors. Most all children will experience nightmares at some point in their childhood. However, only 5% of children experience night terrors. What is the difference?    NIGHTMARE        * When a child is crying from a nightmare, he is awake and alert. He will seek your comfort and if he is able, he will talk to you about his fear.    NIGHT TERROR        * With a night terror, your child will thrash around violently, perhaps screaming; and although their eyes may be open, they are still asleep.    NIGHTMARE        * Upon waking the child, he may remember that he had a nightmare. At the very least, he will likely remember you getting up to comfort him.    NIGHT TERROR        * With a night terror, your child will go back to peaceful sleep and upon waking will not remember the episode at all.    NIGHTMARE        * When your child has a nightmare, you should go to him right away. Hold him and comfort him. Assure him that everything is okay.    NIGHT TERROR        * When your child is having a night terror, do not restrain him or hold him. This may make it even worse. Let him get through the screaming episode until he calms into peaceful sleep. Just be sure to remove any dangers from his path and watch him closely to keep him safe.    There are key differences with nightmares and night terrors. If your child is one of the unlucky 5% that get night terrors, just know that he will grow out of them. Until then, hang on tight and ride it out.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	My three year old has a sensory disorder and with that has come night terrors. The first answer describes them well. DO NOT try to wake the child, or touch them. Stay close by to keep them from harm and let the terror run it's course. My child also sleep walks during her terrors, very scary. After she is done she will snap out of it quickly and come over for a cuddle.|`|lk4ulp69aa	your son is experiencing some kind of mental stage, to which when you get out of his sight, he just totally breaks down, and he thinks that if he dreams about things that are negative, then al of his bad dreams about his mommy not being there will go away.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	My husband had night terrors as a child I was told.  I just read the first answer and that is exactly what his mom and sister said would happen.  He would just cry adn cry and seem awake, but really wasn't. My husband is a sleep talker now if that means anything lol.  He will have a conversation with you in his sleep it is so weird.  I know this isn't an answer, but I just wanted to say that.
X0xHXDcTaa	I did that with my first two til they were 3 1/2 and 18 months. I slept much better and so did they when I got them out of my bed! I enjoyed having them in the bed with me, but it is better for them to be on their own. They learn to soothe and comfort themselves. It's ok to go in and check on them every once in awhile. But if they are being quiet let them go to sleep before you go in!|`|8058fcf2650f54ecf2f7caea81639d08aa	I do not, i dont' want my baby to be 5 years old and be sleeping in my bed. My baby is 6 months old and there has only been one night where she spent most of it here, and that was because she had just had her shots and was a bit fuzzy. Other than that she sleeps in her bed. I'm married and when she's asleep is when my husband and i get to just lay down and relax and talk, out time that we need for eachother, because we're not just parents we're husband and wife and i believe we need us time with out worrying about waking up the baby that might be next to us.|`|lk4ulp69aa	In my opinion, sleeping with your child isn't really a good thing when their 5+ but when their younger than 5 you can give them the reassurance that your there for them, but when they're older, you need to lay down the law that their older now, and that they need to stop being afraid of things that aren't real. If that doesn't work, then get them a night light, then that will teach them that you're not going to always be there for them 24/7 whenever they need attention, they need to be able to live on their own, life lessons.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	We slept with our son when he was a baby and i loved it.    It did though take longer to get him out of our bed but i didnt mind.|`|JGQmr8bLaa	Im not exactly in favor of it.  When it's time for the child to move on they might find it even harder to sleep alone.|`|C8b3KsrGaa	Co-sleep as in take a nap with them when they sleep. It is good, take a nap if you want to, I wouldn't recommend if you have lots to get done and no time to do it in, but if you have time, take a nap.|`|H4OlfmOaaa	i co sleep with my child.. i think its a good idea for the first year or 2 of a childs life but you have to draw the line somewhere, i know people who let their children sleep with them until they were almost teenagers... but as soon as my daughter turns 2 im going to start transitioning her to her own bed..
JgpyfuuWaa	After trying the traditional counting method, I used an ovulation predictor kit - it detects the LH hormone, once that is detected your best bet of getting pregnant is the next 24-36 hours.  I conceived the first month I used that method.

It's a weekday. Don't put her through that.|`|shaO0coWaa	No I don't like it.|`|JYVuP6C5aa	OR you could go with Sunday :)|`|B1bN1cf0aa	No....she would most likely get teased...it's a day of the week|`|canYIE1haa	Tuesday is nice,  what about Sunday? its also a pretty name ^_^|`|KTj9g2mGaa	Tuesday is really pretty.  and.. umm.. for the person who said "it's a day of the week"... threre's people named june, may, april... it's the same concpet....      I think the name is beautiful.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	Noooo.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Nope.|`|0Zm9gI4paa	NO...I don't like the idea of it at all.     Can you imagine a professional woman being called Tuesday by her bosses and colleagues? "Tuesday, I'll need that report on my desk by five o-clock." "We're very impressed with Tuesday's performance." No way! It sounds absolutely ridiculous! And that last example shows how confusing the name might be to others trying to use it in a sentence and not refer to the day of the week.    I'm all for interesting and unique names, but that is going too far. You have to remember that a name lasts a lifetime...not just when she's a baby.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	definatly not.|`|JRlIB8Ttaa	No, what about talulah, tammy|`|Ke7eHQTRaa	Um no. She would be teased so much. She would cry and hate the person that named her that.|`|hjdXE3p9aa	Really abstract names should try to have a normalish nickname    Tuesday = Tuey or Two     So no.      It can be pretty if your considering it for a story or middle name.|`|cSOkd7Umaa	Tuesday is nice...........              FOR A DAY OF THE WEEK!!!  There are many nice girls names out there, dont waste your daughters name on a weekday!!!|`|GDGI49IVaa	Do NOT NAME UR UNBORN CHILD TUESDAY. DO NOT. Lily, i mean seriously if your going for a girls name name her emily. and if it happens to be a boy name him: dallas,merrick,charlie, connor, landon, noah, or tanner...............no, actually, not tanner.    Best of LUCK : DDD|`|DVtKH36Waa	My name is Tuesday and I dont get picked on because of my name. People want to make friends with me because it makes me sound interesting and individual.  Also, why would you want a boring name like everyone else? A name like Emma or Laura, just makes you blend in and it sounds like you have no personality.  Not everyone wants to work in an office, some want to have a more creative existance.    So **** off you boring twats. :).    Tuesday x
GYoNyoWtaa	I'd wait a week after the 28th...just to be sure...that its not to early
AmqQ9it5aa	Yes, and suggest you both get help because your mom is probably lost and looking for something too.|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	Maybe explain to her that you think you do it because she parties all the time.

And typically teens aren't big earners.|`|xv3opX9Maa	as long as they dont go on welfare and expect the tax payers to support them, i dont have any problems with it   my mom had my oldest bro when she was only 14 and i think she did a pretty good job with us   she constantly reminds me and tells me not to let it happen to me   ( =|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	being a Teen parent is hard . I was 18 when i found out i was pregnant but thats not to say teen mothers are bad moms but some teen mothers are very good . you have to give up your whole life for 18 years . its hard stressful but i would not change my life . but i do not say shes a mistake because getting pregnant is NEVER an accident . if you engage in sex with or with out protection you know what can happen . there for in my eyes your trying to get pregnant|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think that they need to stop saying "oh i made a mistake blah blah blah".  Last time I checked, having sex is no mistake.  You take off your clothes and bone because you want to (unless you were forced.)     Anyway, I think that sh*t happens, but they don't deserve the pity that they are given unless the baby was conceived through rape.  Not all of them are sl*ts(it only bothers me when they complain about getting knocked up, or they don't know who the father is.) And of course, when they expect help from other people.  I think when you decide to keep a pregnancy, you are saying "i'm going to be an adult"... and adults raise their own kids.  If you can do it, and do it well, then more power to you.|`|tt6SzpTFaa	I don't mind them as long as they take responsibility and take care of their baby.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	they are strong willed and warm hearted people   they are just as good as older parents and people should really stop being so down on them n get over the fact that teens have sex and always will   and preganacy happens even if u did protect urself|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Despite what many people may think...  THEY ARE PEOPLE!    They have different stories and not all of them are wh0res. They could have been raped for all we know.  Bad things have happened and accidents were made but if they are brave enough to keep the baby and be responsible for their actions I give them my support.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Depends on the teen.  Just like, it depends on the adult.    I know some stupid teen parents, who shouldn't be allowed to have a child, but I know just as many adults the same.    I also know many amazing teen mothers who go to school, work, and put in ample baby time too.    It depends on the person, not the age.    (I'm a 24 year old mother of a 1 1/2 year old little girl by the way.)|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	bad decision but as long as they are willing to take resposibility i think it turns out ok|`|0M45cne5aa	I'm pretty sure i JUST answered this question ; so here is my answer to that (:      there's a lot to think about it. But like everything, you can't judge a book by its cover. How can all these people judge every single teen parent on the face of the Earth by saying "waste", "irresponsible", "raging hormones". Most of these people have never lived through it, so who are they and everyone else to judge the life of a teen parent so quickly and 'correctly'. So many people have so much to say about it, but it's like any other stereotype. There are teen moms (or teen dads) out there that are the most amazing mothers around, and work hard to get where they want in the future while giving their child a good life. Maybe these kids don't get ALL the new things out and don't get spoiled rotten, but isn't that what a well brought up child is based on anyway?! But then there are teen parents out there that are SO irresponsible and stupid. Some of them just so heartlessly turn to abortion (which i am 100% against), while others keep their baby but throw them in a day care or leave them with their parents. These are the kinds of teen parents everyone wants to portray and see, so there stereotype is correct, they look past the good ones, the ones that are as good of parents as they are. But there are definitely the teen parents that are perfectly okay with sitting home and going no where in life. They're okay with giving their child next to nothing, and not wanting to learn a thing about how to raise a child properly.   I am one of the teen parents that do not do that though. I am one of the teen moms who actually cares about my daughter and unborn twins more than the world. I work a part-time job, go to high school, and raise a 2 year old. I'm still with the father, he works a full-time job, he's graduated out of high school and trade school. I plan on going to a college in state when i graduate, and then persue the career i want from there. I never have put my daughter in a day care, nor do i plan to. She is left with one of my parents for one hour a day! My boyfriend and i take care of her on our own, with our own money. The only time family helps is when they are willingly giving things to us or the baby. I am doing great with my life, and i'm not cocky, i'm just proud and happy. I learn more and more about being a successful teen parent every day. And yes, i admit it is VERY hard to get things done when you have kids, but i do it, and i strive for them, i always will.|`|etzhw4j7aa	i think thay should use protection or not have sex at all!whatever happened to chastity belts??????????????????????? as long as they are at least 17 i guess it is ok ............personally iim waiting until im 22-25 ..........to have a baby not to have sex|`|fIjB97qqaa	Unless they were raped, they're really, really pathetic and most of them are idiotic [I've met several].|`|knyjNiy0aa	It depends on their intellectual level and how strong their will is. Some teens are just kids raising kids. But some step up and are willing to change their life to better support their child. Some should not be a parent, but some are better parents than the actual "adults."    It just depends on the person.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	I think most of them are in that situation because of:    1. poor choices  2. parents didn't talk to them about sex  3. they want something to love   4. Heat of the moment situations
243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	Paige Leanne or Nicole Louise.      The others are awful.  They look like names transcribed by a dyslexic.|`|a8mQuc4iaa	sofi may  i like it the names kinda slot together|`|laVH1Bz3aa	Nicole Louise, but perhaps you could steal another middle name.. Nicole Elizabeth? It sounds nice and its better than the alternatives, which are either spelled "uniquely" [read: incorrectly] or just don't sound good.|`|i0DBIVc9aa	maddison as a first name and paige as a middle. when you add the names in conjunction it makes it sound southern and no offense when she is older looking for a career not a job that's the first thing they see. take it from someone who just had a baby. my daughter name is Kaylee (Greek for most beautiful) Zara (pronounced sara arabic for flower) both are very strong names and yet adorable.|`|yMkU1ztZaa	I think most of the names are nice, however while I know you're probably just trying to make the names unique, the "different" spellings will really just make everything a million times harder for the child in life - NOT worth it.  And they make you as a parent look silly.    Madison Lily, Nicole Louise, & Paige Leanne I'd probably choose.. although I do really love Grace, I'm not a huge Shawna/Shona fan.|`|2b4EhYThaa	Nichole is really cute!!|`|9EdUCTwjaa	i luv shona grace|`|J9fxTGwKaa	charley elzibeth|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	I prefer Maddison Grace over Maddion Lily.

Fy9S6hjIaa	Fancy...LOL....after I heard that song when I was a kid I soooooo wished my name was Fancy.      Anyway, I never had any boy's names picked out, and that's what I have is a boy.     I did have a girls named picked out--Elizabeth Marie.  But while I was preggers we decided on both a girl and a boy name and the girl name was Sidney Autumn, not Elizabeth Marie.  As it stands, if our next child is a girl, she will be named Sidney, and if for some reason we just happen to have 3 kids and 2 are girls we'll go with Elizabeth.  So the chances are not likely that we will use the name I pick out as a little girl.  (we only plan on having 2 kid....or maybe just 1)|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I really loved Amber Jade and, uh, Tiffany Savannah.  And Sierra and Brittney.  They were my favourite names ever.    None of those are my style any more.  I wouldn`t use any of them.    When I was younger I wanted to be a watertower.  That`s what I was determined to be when I grew up.

I'm not quite sure what happened to that dream lol.|`|23MPcnNqaa	I'm imagining that a lot of women didn't go with the names they liked when they were younger.  People mature and their thoughts on things change.    However, when I was about 15-16 years old, I had a name in mind that I really liked for my first born son.  (if the father had agreed and liked the name also of course).    When I finally got pregnant at 25, I had still loved the name and fortunately my husband did also.  So we used that for the first born.  Ironically, growing up....I always said that I wanted 3 kids.  2 boys and 1 girl.  I guess I should have specified because my first pregnancy was twin boys.  I never meant 2 boys at once LOL.  But it worked out like that.  Just hoping for my little girl now.  :-)    Oh, by the way, the name I had picked out when I was younger was "Anthony" so it wasn't anything bizarre and unusual.  Thats probably why I never changed my mind on it.|`|M2VneBW3aa	im 14, and alread yhave my name picked out, Claire Noelle (:
rURYaq45aa	its possible maybe you should try taking a test of another brand and try taking the test when you first wake up that's when its most accurate. so just try taking another one by a different brand first in the morning and if not just go to the doctors|`|SbiNNM3Caa	try a different brand   mk sure your not  try plan B pill (read the box first plz)|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	Its always possible but I doubt very much after taking two "negative" tests that you are.

The boy was originally from theUK and the girl was actually Mexican.  Originally, in the beginning of the 1900s, it was actually exclusively male.

Two more famous Ashleys  Ashley Parker Angel (member of that dreadful O-Town band...) - MALE  Ashley Olsen --- FEMALE|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Ok, why do you keep asking about the name Ashley?  Its obvious that you have your doubts about if it could be for a boy or not.  I think that the reason you keep asking is because you're hoping to get responses that agree with your thinking that its a UNISEX name which it is not.    The thing I want to know is are you trying to convince us that Ashley is a UNISEX name or are you just trying to convince yourself.  Its obvious that the majority of people think its NOT a unisex name even though there are some boys named Ashley.  If you want to name your boy Ashley, or whatever Ashley then just do it.    Edit:  Also, Ashley is a Unisex name but is more commonly given to girls.  Boys with the name Ashley are not common.  In the US the book "Gone With the Wind" a male lead character had the name Ashley Wilkes.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Yes I did know that. No I don't know any male Ashley's.

fRAuMrrWaa	You need to learn to prioritize.  As much as you hate school and think that it is getting in the way of your life, you need to realize everything you will miss without school.  You wont have a basketball team, or be one of the most popular girls at school.  I don't know if your friends are smart or not, but it really helps to have some support.  You just need to dedicate at least one hour a day to schoolwork.  School is so important!  I am in college and I can't imagine missing out on college.  Without high school, you will not get to go to college.  If you are considering dropping out of school don't do it.  You will ruin your life and miss out on so much!  School is tough sometimes but you just really need to stick with it and put some effort in it.  I had a great time in high school and I made good grades.  I was also popular, played sports, and loved hanging out with my friends.  It will all work out, just realize that school leads to so many opportunities.  I hope this helps :)|`|FLOjzbKEaa	The only thong i can say is concentrate at school first.  Study as much as you can.   You have your life ahead and you will have time to have fun.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Consider cutting back your class load for a term, if you're allowed.  And allow yourself at least one fun class.    You can study hard and have fun, too, you just need to schedule enough time for both.  It's called time management.  And discipline.  Study hard and play hard.  But each in it's own time.    This doesn't seem to be the issue in your case, but if you can't concentrate while studying, you should have your eyes checked. If they're only slightly out of focus, you won't notice it, but the strain can actually put you to sleep while you're trying to read.  Eyesight can gradually start to fail even in high school (I was halfway through college when it became a major problem for me).    Most normal teenagers "just want to have fun."  The mature, successful ones learn how to make time for it while keeping up their studies.  You can, too.|`|Pn8SATLuaa	suck it up.  your hard  work will pay off...|`|0QWSkCucaa	It's normal for you to feel like that - all guys/girls your age feel like that. I felt like that a few years ago but it does get better (honestly!). Just keep persevering and it will get easier.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	It sounds like you have too much going on, It is important to enjoy being a teenager and to have fun but being a teenager is just a small part of your life, your life will really begin when you graduate HS or college if you go. and its really really important that you have the best education you can so that you will be able to have all the fun and do all the things you want to do as an adult...travel ect. but to be able to have everything you want, you have to have a good job, and usually to get a good job you have to have these courses mastered. find a balance, maybe get rid of 1 or 2 of your extra activities so you arent so stressed and studying wont be so hard. good luck, it doesnt last forever|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You can't have your cake and eat it, too.  Academic success will cost you your social life.  Drama and writing plays will cost you academically.    Are there any classes you can drop?  Any classes you don't need for graduation?  To where you could use that class time period to visit the library and do homework?    Take advantage of your teachers, too.  If you don't understand the material, tell them.  They'll help a lot.    You're obviously overwhelmed.  My daughter as a senior was overwhelmed, too.  I remember how hard it was for her.  I don't know what to tell you, except visit your school counsellor and see how you can lighten your load.    Take care, honey.    TX Mom|`|bfP8tjPKaa	Just work through it, I am 19 I dropped out at 16 I went back at 18 dropped out again at 19 and now I have to PAY for my diploma and get it through an accredited online school. I regret it everyday girl, Its hard, I know it, I don't have a mom [i lost her at age 6] and I couldn't find "myself" in high school. and now I am stuck with no job and in debt because I need to pay for my schooling, its rough! Do not do what I did, it will get better.    Good Luck|`|fE3EDHa4aa	well you seem like a very confident person  which is good.  i am actually in the same situation at the moment.  but im not popular at all and not really good at anything. :)  i've been working hard and i can tell that you have too.  if you get sidetracked in doing anything else just tell yourself that you need to keep focused im a cheerleader so i know how time consuming sports can be.  so it's good to take a mental health sometimes, just to refocus and get on track, take a day out of the week and plan out everything you need to do and trust me it'll help SO MUCH in the long run.|`|S9F6RUncaa	I know the feeling. I'm 14 and I have been losing certain priviledges at school because I wasn't doing work. I assume you are a freshman? or whatever. Remind yourself there's only a few more years to go. thats what I'm trying to do. And I know it sounds nerdy but I also write in a journal every night and it helps to let all my stress out! Try to make yourself busy with things you enjoy to beat the stress|`|utfLcRfWaa	when i was 15 i totally thought the same wayy don't worry...idk if you really want this to happen, but what got me back in check was my mom really punished the heck out of me, like it was badddd. so after that i only slipped a little but not too bad.    so what i would do, is just suck it up (i know that sounds mean) but just get it over with and THEN have fun...like schoowork doesn't go on forever, eventually there'll be a lag where youll get a little break...and theres always summer which  will come up faster than you think=) don't worry about it too much, everyone else is having just as little fun as you are right now, your prob not missing much hah|`|2Dlo82f5aa	As I was told when I was in my teens - do whatever you are doing with full devotion. When playing, play well, when partying, party well and when studying, study well. Do any of these half heatedly, will take you nowhere.|`|hstwNjNaaa	You need to find the balance between all the stuff you do outside of school (sports, friends, volunteer, clubs etc) and studying/homework.    You sound like you do a lot already, so try making a schedule and write in some time to study and do homework. Set aside some time to study for a test, finish your homework or do some revision for a class your not so good it then you. A little every day will help it not pile up so that you feel overwhelmed about it. You only have however many years of school left, enjoy the time with your friends but make sure you don't waste the chance to succeed where you know you can academically!    Just because something won't necessarily help you achieve your ultimate goal or be really fun doesn't mean it isn't important. Just focus and get the hard stuff done with, starting good habits now will help you later in life. You can't do all the fun stuff without working hard!|`|oxeAYFGzaa	First i understand where your coming from school is hard and being 15 i am figuring your in high school. The best thing to do is talk to your parents or teacher at school. Let them know what is going on and how your feeling. I am not sure what your grades are like but with it being February you don't want them to fall any further and cause you to have to repeat the grade your in.     I was the same way in school and never told anyone what was going on or how i was feeling and almost failed 11th grade. since i never talked to anyone i ended up going to college still not liking school and thinking that since all i did was study and still was failing tests that it didn't matter i ended up failing out of college.      My other suggestion would be to just stop worrying about being popular at school and don't spread yourself to thin. have only two or three outside activities that you are involved in and then once you can juggle those and keep your grades up add another one. that way your not trying to do 15 activities and school all at once.     Hope this helped some. Good Luck|`|fb3f968d6fe63ba466a60fa06bb4d2fbaa	You know what, 10 years from now it's not the people you're friends with or the things you did that will be important...but the education you get.      School needs to be your main focus, it's kind of like your job.    Don't let it define who you are now, then it wont define who you're going to be.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	Put all fun to the side because what you do now dictates where you go in life. Life starts when you graduate High school and its not going to give you a chance to learn what you should have in school. If you dont take your school very serious, and have the same attitude after school you will end up flipping burgers at Macdonald's or working a cash register at your local walmart|`|VVaLdsuAaa	hey i was able to get by with a 3.5 in high school without trying or studying, it's not that difficult! put in the little amount of effort you need to get at least a 3.0 (especially if you want to keep up with extracurricular activities like theater and basketball.. you will probably get kicked off the team with academic probation if you don't do better) and you need to get over yourself a little. high school popularity and sports careers end the day you graduate, you don't want to be the one stuck at work all day while your friends are off at school making new friends

She won't stop for me, but she will for a 17 year old guy she's known for 2 days.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Does she know how you feel? Who is she smoking with?  Have you tried talking to her?    EDIT:  Do you have a counselor at school who you can speak with?|`|Zf18VjlCaa	If she's only smoking pot, who cares... it's pot. getting drunk is a lot worse. Yeah she's your friend, but it's not really your concern. Just cos you don't smoke doesn't mean she has to stop cos you don't want her too. Stop being petty and get over it.|`|H4OlfmOaaa	first of all NEVER say you will never do something.... and you shouldn't be angry with her.. talk to her calmly and explain how you feel... whether or not she stops you need to support her in any decision she makes.. if you really are her best friend you need not hassle her about doing it..|`|7qVv4Qi4aa	no your not, but if that's her desicion then let her be. if you don't do it with her she will do it with somebody who will. she might jsut be experimenting, or later it could be she will acerlate to other drugs. then that's when you can be mad, but for now if she hasn't been changing then leave her alone.
wphLaVs6aa	One or two ounces is fine. Her tummy is tiny. She should be eating small amounts frequently rather than large amounts infrequently. But of course, ask your doctor if you have any concerns.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	2-3 oz. is a normal range of formula/breast milk for a 2 week old to be drinking. But, if the baby is still hungry after drinking that 2-3 oz. I would give him more. But don't try forcing him to drink it. You will know when he is full. My daughter used to drink every 1 1/2-2 hours while she was awake during the day. But I feed on demand now, much easier. Your baby might not drink 4-6 ounces for awhile. My daughter is a week 1/2 shy of 4 months & she still only drink 4-5 ounces & a 6 ounce bottle before bed. They will tell you how much they want & when enough is enough. Just go by his cue's. If he's still hungry feed him, if not don't force it, it will only result in him vomiting, being fussy or havea stomach ache.|`|Dhsyroekaa	first week 1-2 next few weeks 2-4.     Babycenter.com|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter is 3 weeks old and she drinks anywhere from 2-4...depending on her mood...sometimes 2 is enough...I mainly mix 3 oz of formula for her. If she cries for more, I'll mix another oz.
A5mkPwIqaa	He's not too young at all! I think it's important for kids to have experience with other kids their age at a young age and to learn how to separate from their parents. It's fine if he can't really talk yet. I work at an early learning center and I'm the 15-24mo. teacher. Personally, I use simple sign language to help communicate with the kids, but even without that, you can usually figure out what they're trying to tell you. If you're nervous about it, why not try sending him there for half-days to start with?|`|wE5JMeesaa	That's a matter of choice.    I work at a wonderful daycare center--and my class is 18-24 months.  So, there are other parents who think their toddler is ready.    No one will ever love your child like you do.  Always remember that.  But I can honestly say I love all my kids.  And I get to see the friendships they build and how they learn from each other--and I can't help but think it's really great for them socially.      If you're nervous, do part time.  Go half days or a couple times a week.|`|yfcJwQr8aa	my daughter has been in daycare since 6 months old.  She has great social skills with other kids, and he helped her learning development because her providers actuall ytaught the kids instead of letting them play.  she learned how to share early and how to play nicely.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	its not to young   some parents put there child in alot younger then that   i wouldn't worry about the speaking , being around other children and adults will help him with that .  Im thinking about putting my son in child care at 6 months , just for one day a week , so he gets to socialize . ( we are stuck in the house all day every day)|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My daughter started at daycare when she was 8 months old, because I went back to school.  She started learning at a rapid rate!!    Some childcare centers don't take babies....and start at 2 or 3.    But I would reccommend it, it's great for them to socialize, learn, and play in different settings!
Kpn4xceEaa	Instead of thinking cheapest - think best for what you can afford.
8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	you might have better luck posting this question in a different section. even though the book is anti BABY NAME it has nothing to do with baby names.
tivpa7Vlaa	most likely u are feeling the baby moving as the weeks go by u will be much more sure it is the baby. there is gonna be times when u want to rest/sleep and the baby will be moving like he is in a disco..lol i guess your doctor will do the regular check up pressure,weight,urine and listen to baby heart beat and maybe a sonogram to tell the sex if u havent had it done yet. best of luck|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    it sounds like you are feeling baby ;)    They may do an ultrasound level 2 .and let you know the sex aswel.  They will feel your uterus to see how its growing.   doppler to hear bubs heart ;)  check your blood pressure maybe your wieght.  talk to you about needs to be discussed and any questions you may have.    god bless x|`|puCOYwMmaa	I think you're definitely feeling the baby!!!    Otherwise it'll probably be just like your last appointments, weight, bp, urine test, etc.
m2aznd8xaa	welcome to mommy hood. i have the very same problem .i have a 20 month old and she goes to sleep about 8-9 and still wakes up a bunch too and to say the least you are not alone.ive tryed it all to and sometimes we just gotta throw in the towel. i dont have a solution. i do the whole bedtime routine. snack ,bath, book,some milk and she need her sippy cup too. but she gets up.but know you aint alone and i feel your tiredness lol. i also have a 9 year old and when i tuck her in in bed i . i remind myself how fast they grow up and soon enough they will go to sleep all night and one day they wont need us at all.thats the only thing that keep me sain after getting up 4-5 times at night.some days im luck and shell only wake up twice. lol  i just potty trained her and that also reminds me how fast she is growing up. i just hope better sleep for her comes soon too.  good luck.|`|EyKJ737daa	Does she have day sleeps? If she does and they are more than an hour, then I would cut her back to 1 sleep, no longer than 1 hour.  If she is not sleeping at all during the day or for less than 1 hour then it is a habit that she is forming herself at night with your help, sorry but only stating facts.  She is associating your singing to her at night as a sleep association so therefore she will not go to sleep without it.  When it stops she wakes and the cycle continues.  At age 2 she understands A LOT of what you are saying and asking of her now so you need to tell her that you will sing one song (maybe sing it together) but don't let her fall asleep. If she starts to fall asleep, tell her you are leaving so she can go to sleep. Otherwise, sing the song and say good night.  Tell her you love her and you will see her in the morning.  This is going to be tough for you but you need to let her cry so she can teach herself to self settle.  When she cries during the night, (and she will) you can return to her room, keeping the room dim or using a light outside her room to throw a small amount of light into her room so you can see her.  Reassure her quietly with little interaction. Tell her it is bed time and time for her to go to sleep.  You may have to repeat this process for a while but don't go in too quickly when she does start crying.   Wait longer and longer each time before you attend to her.  Eventually, not only through exhaustion but also from understanding, she will realise that you will not come in at night and she will learn to self settle herself back to sleep.  Maybe offer her a reward in the morning if she can not cry out for you. Find the right incentive and I'm sure you will find it very effective.  Be prepared though sweetie for a tough week ahead as it may take that long for her to come to the realization that night time is for sleeping not waking and singing.  Good luck and I wish you all the best.  Stay strong, you can do it sweetie.    Edit: stop the bedtime bottle too, another sleep association.  She is getting too old for a bottle and it is not good for her teeth to be sleeping with a bottle as it will ROT her teeth.  Start giving her a sipper cup or even a normal cup, at age 2 she should be drinking from a cup now with no problems.  She will learn that if you want your milk, you drink it first from a cup and then teeth brushed and bed.  Sorry sweetie but get rid of the bottles and start giving her a sipper cup or normal cup.
PeylccoJaa	You both need to have it checked with your doctor. There are creams for these types of problems but get the Dr's advice first.|`|wphLaVs6aa	Call your doctor. If it's thrush or mastitis or something else, you should get it checked out right away. It's important not to let this go and get worse.|`|3ay0KVVDaa	OUCH, I would call my obgyn and have her look at it. I got a clogged milk duct and it caused a infection with fever and a HUGE red lump... OUCH!
fHjSonssaa	I use the Clorox spray that santitizes but isn't bleach.  I'm drawing a blank on the name- but it's very common.  "anytime spray"- safe around pets/food/kids/etc  I use that- but not EVERYDAY time I wash the toys- and it also depends on the reason I'm washing them.  If it's just becuse my son was playing in his crib with they toy and slobbered all over it- I use soap and water.  If it's because he dropped it at the mall on floor or at the DR's office- I use the santizing spray.  I used to ALWAYS use the sanitizing spray.  I think some people thought I was crazy- I jsut wanted my son to have safe toys.  But as he's gotten older and puts EVERYTHING in his mouth-I've realized that no matter how much you watch them, they are going to ocasionally get SOMETHING in their mouth that you wouldn't like them to.  You're not too far off from that stage.  I am still one of the most "anal" mothers about my sons things, I've just realized what's necessary and what's going overboard.  Use good judgement.  Don't spend ALL of your energy cleaning your baby's toys- all that sanitizing/wahing/rinsing takes time.  I swear I used to spend all day washing/cleaning/etc....  With that said- I still sterilize my son's bottles.  He's 10 months old.  I do it out of habit because we did it when he was a preemie baby.  And I've just never thought to stop.  Until tonight.  And tomorrow I think I'm just going to start soap washing.    Clorox anytime sanitizing spray works great, is affordable and safer than bleach- plus it's already mixed.  It's intended for toys.|`|puCOYwMmaa	I would think soap and water would be fine.  Bleach seems like overkill, especially when you consider what kinds of things they find when they start crawling around.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I just use soap and hot water. My mom used to use bleach and water when I was little. I personally think that soap and water works just fine, especially if you clean them frequently anyway. A little dirt never hurt anyone!|`|UXdQxkHYaa	I wouldnt use bleach because it can be risky...Soap and water should work just fine as long as you are using anti-bacterial soap. If you want though you could also look up green cleaning products. I clean homes for a living and use alot of them. they are enviromentally freindly and in most cases harmless for people.|`|Y3dFm6uGaa	I am really old!     Goodness, I cannot remember ever 'cleaning' my kids' toys except when they got them REALLY dirty -- and that would have been washing them off with water to get the dirt off them!    I think folks are WAY too much concerned about germs today.    I'd be more concerned about the stuff polluting their brains from TV and movies they are seeing,    In my day, we expected to eat a "peck of dirt" before we died.    WOW!|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	If it's actually dirty and not just food/slobber sticky, I use Lysol sanitizing wipes then let it air dry completely. After I rinse in scalding water to remove any possible residue and let air dry again. That's infrequent though, mostly it's hot soapy water & air dry.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	soap and water; u don't need bleach on toys that have only been used in your house....or even if u get them somewhere else, just clean them thoroughly and it's fine; i have done that with all my dd's toys and she hasn't been sick a day in her life....only exception is if it is from goodwill or something like that, my mil is obsessed with gw; it if is hard plastic or will tolerate, i soak it with lysol and after it dries i wash it a few times with soap and water bc i know it will eventually end up in her mouth...if they are stuffed toys i wash and dry them in the w and dryer|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	lay a towel out on my kitchen table, and i spread the toys out not toys that can absorb water, every toy should be water-safe, no holes or anything or anything that is electronic.    and i mix 1 part bleach and 3 parts water into a spray bottle and spray them and let them dry fully over night|`|74pfB2Bnaa	I put stuffed animals and toys made from fabric into the washing machine every now and then. Other toys I clean with water and soap in the sink.   Frankly, don't go overboard with sanitizing your baby's surroundings. Babies need some dirt to develop healthy immune systems.
YsnY9LqIaa	My daughter is breastfed and eats 3 solid meals a day.  When we first introduced solids she was really constipated, then it went to 2-3 dirty nappies per day.  Now she's 17 months and has one every 1-2 days so it does get better!|`|50lIaC8zaa	Im not really sure but i would say twice a day is prob about average, my DD went through a stage recently of pooping 4 or 5 times a day, it was literally after any food but it seemed to stop after a couple of weeks. As long as he is putting on weight and its not diarrhoea i wouldn't worry too much. x|`|4YIUxSlYaa	My daughter have about 4 dirty nappies a day.  Ugh, lucky you, when she was breastfed she was having about 6 a day!|`|pDRAciBnaa	holly usually goes everyday,she does suffer constipation so started to give her prunes and now once or twice a day! i think this is quite normal.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Um, it can vary by child and by age - my oldest would have a BM 7 times a day for a long time, at least 4 a day, his brother sometimes did that many.   As long as it's not watery or foamy, he's fine.|`|gGW7K9U5aa	My son was an every other day baby. My daughter on the other hand goes about 5-7 times a day. Shes also on solid food too. Its normal. Just as long as its not diarrea then hes fine. :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	While there really is no answer to your question both constipation and diarrhea can be a sign of allergies.    Also a breastfed baby under 9 months should not be getting 3 meals a day unless you are trying to forcibly wean the baby from breastmilk and all breastmilk substitutes (formula, cow's milk, etc)|`|sFTqY3tmaa	I have 3 kids and they were all breastfed.  The frequency can vary especially with breast milk.  It will normalize and get better with time believe me on that.  Sometimes it is just the symptom of the digestive system acclimating to the new solid foods.  If it seems to cause discomfort or rash you can introduce something else suited to that age.  My each had different things that did not completely agree with them when they started out solids.  Remember to introduce 1 thing at a time and do not go overly rich as that can cause issues. Hang in there!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	The extra poops are possibly due to the formula you have introduced - it goes through them a lot quicker and isn't as easily digested/used by the body.  Or he could be teething, is the poop stinkier and runnier than usual, any bit of mucus to it?  If so that is diarrhea and some may say it isn't a sign of teething but many moms will tell you it always accompanied a tooth for their LO's.  Elyse always has frequent poops/diarrhea when she cuts a tooth.      Elyse eats 2-3 meals a day and goes anywhere from once a day to skipping 2-3 days and then going 4-5 times in that one day, lol!
e92vFGEWaa	NAME HIM RYAN|`|l0R7BiJkaa	In 99.9% of the rest of the world's culture, it's the name of the devil.|`|ENtaLmvbaa	lmao you've got to be joking|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I don't like it, sorry.|`|Jswomud7aa	If you live in America everyone will think you named your kid after the devil and will think you are crazy.... I don't care what it means in your culture...    Do not name your kid Lucifer if you live in the U.S. I mean seriously... this is a ridiculous question!|`|M6c0hUefaa	LOL. Sure, why not?|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	yeah its also what people call the devil since that was his name|`|mCAWxobNaa	I think it's fine although the other children may be very cruel.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Lucifer actually means "bringing light"    And, I actually think it's a lovely name.   However, many people believe Lucifer to be the name of the devil (I don't believe this, but many do). And since it is such a widespread notion, I would avoid using it, simply for the sake of the child.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	I don't know what culture you're in but Lucifer as I know him was a "heavenly angel" but greed took him over which caused him to be kicked out of heaven & thus left to wreak havoc on mankind. Really wanna scar your kid with that name?|`|tDB1UuWzaa	I think he would be met with ... precautions.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	"Lucifer" is another name for the devil in western culture. It would lead to a lot of playground beatings!|`|nZPGdcKJaa	is your culture satanism?|`|mPTBU0QDaa	I think it is more commonly known as the devil's name. If that doesn't bother you, go for it. But think about what your child might have to deal with.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	LOL.  No matter what it means in your culture....that would be just plain mean to the child if you live in north america!|`|agTCqkLDaa	It means Satan in my culture :-\|`|xhVe918waa	Name him Lucifer Sam.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8sNEedLe...|`|nGGDddyUaa	no.. he will act like the devil if you name your baby that|`|Erdyu0bEaa	If you want a devil baby. If you did not know lucifer was the devil.|`|DP48dIxhaa	No. Lucius is good though.|`|wnbz5gNzaa	Maybe a middle name, but for the first, you'd be giving that  kid a heap of trouble always explaining his name.|`|SP9toeU4aa	If you want people to call him the devil his whole life, then yes. People will misconstrue that as Satan, since that was his name before he fell from heaven.|`|4e7c15c0412290b475dc6c53a1810cd2aa	in most other cultures it refers to the devil just try a google search and check the results    think of it like this when this child grows up and has his own life,  what do you think the public reaction to his name would be? how do you think he might be treated? teasing? name calling? ect.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Hell to the NO!!! Thats a horrible thing to do to your child. You may appreciate it but a lot of people wouldnt. They would pry be scared of him!

hWc65sEtaa	He sounds like a good role model for your daughter.  She will grow up with the understanding that there is a good man in her life  I would let him spend as much time with her as he wants.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Yeah.  If that's really how the uncle is then sure.  The more positive influences children have from adults in their lives the better off they are.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Sure, sounds like a good uncle. My kids spend a lot of time with my wifes sister (their aunt) I know my SIL has plans of being the "cool" aunt. It's great to have extended family.    Sorry about the dad though.|`|r07BwhO1aa	I don't see a problem here, sounds like he would be a positive male role model.|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	Sounds okay let him see her   Of course I have a suspicious nature and always worry about child molestation  how well do you know the brother?
8KdPPF4Oaa	I don't think this would ever happen... Actually I know this wouldn't ever happen..

6igjX2cnaa	hi hun.  Well, when I was on Clomid 50mg in November it worked way too well, even at the low dose.  I had 3 mature follies and 3 more trying to come up and mature... but the clomid thinned out my lining.  It was only 4.5mm thick.  That's too thin for implantation.  My nurse gave me a trigger shot to ovulate the mature eggs I had in hopes maybe  I would get pregnant, but it was a bust.  The dr. likes it to be between 8mm-12mm thick for implantation.    I did the same thing too when they told me my lining was thin that cycle.... I hit the internet and began searching about thin lining.  It is possible, not probable... BUT TOTALLY POSSIBLE hun!!  Just stay positive :)  Best wishes :)
yOhGkcNjaa	Its not greedy at all to miss your dad. My parents have been divorced since i was about the same age, i live with my dad but i see my mom more then you see your dad. When i was growing up i lived with my mom, she would always talk about my dad like that so i decided to live with him. You can always talk to friends about how you feel. If they get mad at you about that then they aren't real friends. Never feel guilty about missing someone though. Talk to your mom, tell her you want to  see him and its your dad so you should be able to, tell her you know he didnt always do the right thing (even if you dont agree) but you have to be the bigger person and go see him or you might not see him for a long time. I know how you feel and if you ever want to talk about it feel free to email me and talk to me.     --Brittanynicoleloves@yahoo.com|`|qN5iVvAFaa	my parents divorced when i was 5...i also like you missed my dad more than anything... but now that im 18... im getting to know my dad much more. because my mom has no say in the matter... all i can say.. is you might have to wait until you are 18...
E7ViD8EWaa	It's great, isn't it?  Totally makes my day!

AA11083526	I would just tell M how you feel. I think in this situation C and M are just friends, so I would just talk to M about it, maybe ask if he wants to go to the Valentines Day dance (if your school has one) and see how things go. Good luck.|`|tt6SzpTFaa	Go for him!  Flirt like you've never flirted before.  haha|`|hyCw0Qyaaa	advice on what?  valentines day is just a crap holiday made up by card companies to make money and make you feel like a peice of ****,.|`|UftgUcCIaa	My advice to you is to just start talking to him casually. Show you're more interesting than C who already has a boyfriend and (no offense to her) should stop throwing herself at M. Anyways, regardless of how he feels about C, he knows she has a girlfriend and he clearly doesn't find you boring. (Which is great to start out with!) But you should just talk to him. Talk about homework, ask him how his day was, ask to borrow a pencil/lead/pen, etc. Just become friends at first and see what happens :D|`|rclph8qCaa	I think that you should show him that you can be the girl he wants. Tomorrow (or next time you see him) make sure u look extra hot, even if you have to steal a hairstyle from C. Casually flirt with him, like if he tries to make u laugh, just kinda smile a lil. Maybe making him think your kinda peeved with him will make him pay more attention to him. I mean yall are all buddy buddy and then all of a sudden WHAM u shake it up a lil, he'll pay a lil more attention to you!
2a0bb2a88612e9c4297e7634a5a0382caa	I have the same darn problem right now...These men just want to keep you hanging.  They expect you to sit in the house when they are gone and will not even answer the phone because you  know we always call as a curtious.  But when they turn their phone off they exspect us to be home waiting, if we are not their when they arrive they just get str8 attitude and they act as if they are girls.  Their attitude does not let up either ...It is ridiculous but so true.  They want to keep us hostage or something.  Just let him keep his funky attitude and do not let him know it bothers you at all cause thats what he is trying to do.. So the next time he will exspect you to sit and wait like a dam fool..You get me girl.  Its just what they do!!!Good luck...|`|e612bd49baf67bd4917d9ff831f9945aaa	It sounds like he may be having things on his mind that may or may not have anything to do with you. \    The best thing to do is to set up a time to talk to him when he is not busy (like at home after dinner or something) and be honest about how you feel like he is being unneccesarily upset lately and would like to know if there is anything he would like to talk about or open up about.           Tell him you care about him and are there for him if he is stressed, but that if he is, he should not take it out on you. Hopefully he will be relaxed and will open up. It's propably just work issues or even insecurity over something small.    JUST ASK. Communication is  like water to a plant. If you don't check on that plant and water it , it's going to die. So w/out talking and sharing our feelings in a relationship, you risk taking things out on eachother or holding grudges in.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Wow, I have not a clue, I'm sorry you married someone who has so little communication with you. He's holding a grudge for something that only he knows. That's bad news. Don't let it last that long, you need to talk to him or obviously you will both be miserable. Maybe he didn't fall asleep right away, maybe hes sensitive and thought you were rude by falling asleep. When you go to sleep next try feeling for his penis and if he doesn't push you off give him a BJ, guys love that and my X-fiance always forgave me if I did that. Then talk to him, if he pushes you off, then say what's wrong?? Tell him you know there's something wrong and it's killing you how can you fix something if you have no clue what happened?  I don't know what else to do. Good luck.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	What does this have to do with pregnancy?|`|FbVn8f5jaa	Try just talking to him, maybe hes just stressed and is not realizing hes talking it out on u.|`|AY7EIxICaa	Well, if this is your husband and he is treating you this way, I would find out why ASAP!  That is some strange behavior.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	He felt used and also its one of those things you want to do things with him and he wants to do things with you as well. You have to understand he wanted husband and wife time. My wife is the same way right after sex she wants to pass out and go right to bed. You might have to kinda try and make more time for him and if he wants to have sex just ask him before hand if he has anything planned for that evening that he wants to do because if you have sex you will want to go to sleep. It also can be to where he is stressed out at work then wanted some one to vent to after sex about there work.|`|AA12178731	i cant give you advice because its your life, In-fact i am still single.... after read y our statements i realize some thing that may be both of you were bore about life.....let start from the be gain..... may be  your husband tired from work and his life style... both of you need to go some where for some day then made a short romance... i hope every thing will be happy.... or you have you show him you are attractive then others.....|`|UiQ6V377aa	talk to him?

GYoNyoWtaa	In most cases, no. While it's highly unlikely that taking a single dose of aspirin in early or mid-pregnancy will have a harmful affect, the drug can cause problems for both you and your baby if you take it regularly in normal adult doses while you're pregnant. So, except in a few cases, it's best to avoid aspirin altogether during this time.    Here's why: Studies have linked aspirin to various pregnancy complications. A few studies show that taking aspirin around the time of conception and in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. And some researchers believe that taking aspirin at adult doses during pregnancy might affect the baby's growth and may slightly increase the risk of a placental abruption.    Finally, taking full-dose aspirin later in pregnancy might delay labor and increase the risk of heart and related lung problems in your newborn and bleeding complications for you and your baby.    On the other hand, if you're already taking a prescribed dose of aspirin for a specific condition, you may need to continue taking it during pregnancy. (Check with your healthcare provider.)    In certain situations, your caregiver may advise you to start taking a small dose of aspirin each day, usually similar to the amount in one baby aspirin. Most experts believe low-dose aspirin therapy is safe during pregnancy.    For example, some experts recommend that pregnant women with a condition called antiphospholipid syndrome take a low dose of aspirin in addition to a drug called heparin. Antiphospholipid syndrome is diagnosed in women who have certain antibodies in their blood and who also have a history of blood clots or some types of pregnancy problems.    Some research shows that certain women at high risk for preeclampsia (including women with chronic hypertension, severe diabetes, or kidney disease, or who had severe preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy) may benefit from low-dose aspirin therapy, although not everyone agrees on who is a good candidate for this treatment, when it should begin, and what the optimal dose is.    So unless your healthcare provider prescribes it, you should avoid taking aspirin altogether, as well as other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen sodium (Aleve), and ketoprofen (Orudis), which can have similar effects.    Check the labels of all over-the-counter drugs to make sure they don't contain aspirin or other NSAIDs. Better yet, check with your caregiver or pharmacist. It can be hard to tell because some products list their ingredients under different names. Aspirin is sometimes called salicylate or acetylsalicylic acid, for example.    When you need to take something for pain relief while you're pregnant, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is considered safe to use as directed on the label.|`|p0prrzf2aa	NO! its not. you need to take tylenol|`|EMKuBql8aa	Only Tylonal.|`|XCueIYnYaa	Tylenol. the others can thin your blood.|`|ElkcUb8Eaa	they say to take tylenol. stick with that.|`|puCOYwMmaa	No, nothing but tylenol.  Absolutely no aspirin or ibuprofen.|`|akB0gV20aa	Absolutely NO Asprin or IB or Aleve..Tylenol is it.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	you arent supposed to take asprin or ibuprofen. take tylenol.|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	I know it is OK to take Tylenol (acetaminophen).  http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe...|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The only 4 things that are on my absolutely not safe list from my Dr are....    Aspirin  Ibuprofen  Alka Seltzer(contains aspirin)  Pepto Bismol(contains aspirin)    You can only take Tylenol.|`|T5avxqUZaa	dont take aspirin, ibuprofen (tylenol) is the only thing you should take and not extra strength just regular.  I forget what it is but there is something bad in asprin for when your pregnant.    I bought the book "What to Expect When your Expecting" it has alot of information in it, you can also check books out at the library :) congratulations on being pregnant!!|`|Y6TSCciKaa	No it's not. Take only tylenol.
vtMqmFjaaa	I would suggest shaving...waxing can be painful, irritate your skin, and even make sex uncomfortable.  I think the most popular style is the "landing strip", although I'm sure different guys have different tastes.  Basically, so long as it's not a jungle, it's easier for him to navigate.    Here are some different styles (although I recommend to just shave):  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_w...    EDIT:  To all the other, closed-minded, puritanical replies...  I started having sex when I was 15, and I have no regrets (except that early on the sex was pretty clumsy, haha).  We were perfectly aware of pregnancy and STD risks, which is why we used a condom every time.    I didn't give diddly squat for trying to fit it or that my "worth was between my legs" (and honestly, if you make a point to hold out on sex just for the sake of holding out on sex, YOU must believe there's some worth down there).  I was just curious, horny, and had an attractive (and also curious and horny) guy to accommodate me.    There are 20 and 30 and 40 years olds who have unsafe sex, unintentional pregnancies, and get STD's.  Common sense isn't just something you get all of a sudden as an 18th birthday present.    Sure, there are some young people who are pressured into having sex, but the assumption that any young person who decides to have sex lacks self-esteem and succumbing to someone else's will is...uh...wrong.|`|GXVanwgPaa	i'd go w/ nare. but seriouly, ur 14? what is wrong w/u? can't u just grow some morrals and wait? would that really be so bad?|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Don't do it!  You're too young!  At 14 you should be focusing on friends, your education, etc., not sex.  And don't feel like you have to grow up fast just because other people are.  You're still a kid, so by all means, be a kid!  It's sad how so many kids think they have to have sex now and do all this "adult" stuff when they should just be doing what normal kids used to do.  And it's very risky to have sex, too.  I don't know if you were planning on using protection or not, but even if you did use it, that doesn't guarantee that you won't get pregnant or get an STD.  I strongly suggest that you abstain!|`|HyknHVV5aa	I think 14 is a little young to be having sex. If you can, I think you should wait until you can at least drive, so 16. Imagine having a baby when you are 14 and you still need your parents to drive you and your child everywhere!!! Ideally, I think you should wait until you are legally an adult, but I think 14 is too young.    If you are gong to have sex, go on birth control. You can go on pills or  depo (the shot). If you are planning on having sex, start birth control, and wait at least a month of being on birth control for your body to get used to it. And, of course, use condoms. Contracting an STI at such a young age would ruin your love life forever.    To answer your question: guys like it 'bald'. So, I would just shave since waxing hurts lots! Do not use Nair or Veet, hair removal creams are not recommend to be that close to your genitals and can burn your skin and cause other problems! The only products that should be that close to genitalia is wax or shaving cream. But please, wait until you are older, and you MUST go on birth control minimum one month before you have sex or do any sexual activities. Be safe.|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	You are 100% too young to have sex|`|ETthFRBEaa	they dont care as long as it is not long but you are young you should wait|`|AA11851101	Are u serious?  I would be asking "  What is the best way to protect myself from STD's or an unwanted pregnancy?  The least of my worries would be shaving your jungle.  Obviously you are not ready for sex!!!|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	Why do you want to have sex? Are you aware of the things that can happen? I was 14 when I first had sex and I regret it now that I am older and have been in the real world. Sex is not all that it is cracked up to be. Have you watched or heard about the ABC show The Secret Life of the American Teenager? That could be you. Even a condom is not 100% proof. I hope that you reconsider the fact of having sex. You only have one virginity and when it is gone it is gone. It should be something that you treasure.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	ARe you serious love?    First of all, you dont want to have sex - you want to fit in with the "cool" kids because they are all most likely sl_ts and are having sex to try and impress the guys so they will like them - the truth is, guys don't like women or girls who are easy.  If you keep your virginity and lose it when you know its right, then it will mean so much more - i wish i had lost it to someone who loved me, but now i am with my husband and he and i are in love - trust me, don't be a sheep and copy everyone else.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	You have not yet reached the legal age to be having sex.  There are many responsibilities that come with having sex. Firstly, you shouldn't be worrying about your pubic hair...you should be more concerned about the sexual health and well being of both yourself and the person you are planning to have sex with.   At 14, you are not ready to be doing this. You might think you are but you are not. It's not just the physical side of things... there are a lot of emotions that come with sex.    What happens if you get pregnant? Don't be naive and think ''it won't happen to me.'' I could easily be you!   What happens if you get a sexually transmitted disease? Better yet, what happens if you contract an STD that is not easily treatable? You may have to live with it forever.   If you are going to go ahead with this, you need your mum to take you to the doctor and have you put onto the pill. And when you are on the pill you still need to use condoms every single time. And while you are sexually active, if you are changing partners, you need to be tested by your doctor every 3 months to make sure you are healthy.     http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health...  http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org/te...  http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...  http://www.sexetc.org/story/love_relatio...|`|r07BwhO1aa	Please don't have sex!!  Gosh you don't even know how to garden right yet you want to have some one inspect your flower!!    You are 14 and will regret the choice to do this when you are older.    Please for the love of all that is holy understand that your worth as a person is not between your legs.     Say it with me:    MY WORTH AS A HUMAN BEING IS NOT BETWEEN MY LEGS!!

I think this is the doctors' faults more than anyone...they should have known better and i know there is some kind of code of ethics for InVitro.  Not only is it psychologically and physically hard on the mother to carry and take care of 8 newborn babies at the same time, but those babies could have died! lets hope they dont have any complications as they grow older.  i do think it was very irresponsible of her. i feel bad for her parents.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/World/2009/0...      That is a media report on how and why she is addicted to In-Vitro Fertilization. All of her children were conceived using In-Vitro, and with the use of Sperm Donors.|`|5f6XnInEaa	I think it's ignorance.    This 'mother' does not have a job, does not have a husband, does not have her own house, and is bankrupt.    Now, a doctor would know these things, yet still decided to go ahead with it.    Apparently, she claims the doctors paid her to do it.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_o...    I guess there are 8 more welfare babies, not to mention charity cases in the world.|`|cG80UU5Waa	I don't understand why this happened, and it's definitely irresponsible at least of the part of the doctors to implant 8 embryos in a woman with 6 kids. I don't get why she would go through in-vitro after 6 kids either, that's a little weird. She's lucky that her babies are fine, when this happens usually some or all of the babies die, and are a lot more likely have disabilities.|`|gzZn4aBKaa	i cannot make judgment on her case as the media will say anything to make a story sell,  but i could say that even after giving life to 14 kids   that i would think  if you had given birth to  them naturally  you would have given up after 4  but i would be just guessing that all these children  that have been given a chance to live from her  would have started  life with a  C- section, and that would  be  a lot easier to  end up going through all that many child births.
jNErU39iaa	I was told the same thing when I was about 8 years old by my (male) english teacher!  It's horrible isn't it? I would definitely talk to the school - that's what my mother did!|`|K7H1zrCbaa	its a common myth.    and i think you're blowing way out of proportion.|`|vPYcoJ0yaa	I googled "human embryonic gills"... found many sites regarding the myth...  here is one: http://emporium.turnpike.net/C/cs/slits....    "You can hardly attend high school or college now days with out hearing or reading this "whopper". In fact, neither gills nor their slits are found at any stage in the embryological development of any mammal including man. The folds in the neck region of the mammalian embryo, that are erroneously called "gills", are not gills in any sense of the word and never have anything to do with breathing. They are merely flexion folds, or wrinkles, in the neck region resulting from the sharply down turned head and protruding heart of the developing embryo. These folds eventually develop into a portion of the face, inner ear, tonsils, parathyroid and thymus. No reputable medical embryology text claims that there are "gill slits" in mammals.    Still, the gill slit myth is perpetuated in many high school and college biology text books as "scientific evidence" for evolution. Even Dr. Spock in his book 'Baby and Child Care' claims that "as the baby lies in the amniotic fluid of the womb, he has gills like a fish." Perhaps the "gill slit" myth continues to be taught because there is no better "evidence" for evolution. How many of you were taught the gill slit myth in school??"    It appears to be evolutionists looking for more proof that we evolved from fish. As an evolutionst, myself, I have all the proof already without having to make up stuff. But some people will believe anything, won't they. Some even believe the bible is a factual reference/history book!|`|DdOtU7Nyaa	did you see her say this first hand? if not, your kids are probably being kids and over reacting (like you are) and reading into what she said.    I suggest you take it up with the teacher before going to random people on yahoo answers.|`|qUTmN23Raa	your daughter might be pulling your leg... and if not go to the school|`|Do7M9ij3aa	The teacher is correct.  Embryos are equipped with "gills" before the lungs and facial features are fully developed. they close  during development.    Some babies are born with brachial cleft cysts  - it is merely a TINY hole (about the size of the end of a pencil) that is left over from these gills.  You can google that term or search it on youtube.  These cysts must be periodically drained or removed surgically.    I have one and so does one of my children - IT'S GENETIC - the gills that don't close, that is.    YES - THE TEACHER IS CORRECT!  Don't have her fired!  :-)|`|jkDbDjcRaa	ummm....I would talk to the school about that!|`|G4qP2gATaa	Ok.|`|9aCC3HE8aa	Human embryos do have gill slits (all embryos do) in humans they are pharyngeal pouches. In fish, these develop into gills, but in reptiles, mammals, and birds, they develop into other structures.  The throat (or pharyngeal) grooves and pouches, falsely called "gill slits" are not mistakes in human development. They develop into absolutely essential parts of human anatomy. The middle ear canals come from the second pouches, and the parathyroid and thymus glands come from the third and fourth... another pouch, thought to be vestigial by evolutionists until just recently, becomes a gland that assists in calcium balance. Far from being useless evolutionary vestiges, then, these so-called "gill slits" are quite essential for distinctively human development.|`|xFJ2zjIVaa	yeah they do though  the fetus  lives in amnyotic fluid.....FLUID!!  the fetus has gills that are on the neck and once they are about to be born they fuse with the skin  there have been reported cases of babies born w/ the gills  but thats really rare|`|7SKVCPcSaa	haha. yes|`|DqneyCYFaa	What a coincidence, I'm in an AP Biology science class and my science teacher just told me the same thing a few days ago.

Embryology One of several rudimentary invaginations in the surface of the embryo, present during development of all air-breathing vertebrates and corresponding to the functional gill slits of aquatic species. Also called branchial groove.    They have slits.  They do not develop into functional gills.  The embryo does not use these for breathing purposes.

l2BjWA5Baa	Your other three names work because the first and middle names have different numbers of syllables/stress patterns.  So JE-sse Na-THAN-iel is a good choice, while JE-sse NA-than would not be.    Hm...  Jesse McKenna?  Jesse Craig?  Jesse Knox?  Jesse Blake?  Jesse Vaughn?  Jesse Alexander?  Jesse Zachariah?    Or if you end up with two boys, I'd go with Jesse Quinn, I think.    Finally, Francis is more commonly a male name, while Frances tends to be the female spelling (although since she'll be named after her grandma, you may not want to change the spelling).    Caroline Quinn is so cute, though. I hope you have at least one girl!|`|jMJvOcJaaa	Oh deffinately cute names   and so classy they are going to be special........:)|`|WauZTodNaa	This is tough since I don't know your family, but since you like Francis, if you were to have two boys, maybe, Jesse Franklin.|`|0Zm9gI4paa	I love your names!! They are so cute. I'm not as wild about Beckett as the other ones, though....it reminds me of the bad dude in Pirates of the Caribbean LOL. For Jesse's middle name, what about:    Jesse John  Jesse James (I know it's the name of some famous guy but it sounds really cool!)  Jesse Jacob (for some reason the alliteration sounds nice to me)  Jesse Christopher  Jesse Joseph  Jesse Nathaniel    I can see your dilemma - it was hard to think of names that sound good with Jesse! Those were the best I could think of. Hope this helps a little...good luck!|`|GIqACtxvaa	Love Beckett|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	They're very cute.

xRZ1PRZwaa	I remember visiting my parents one night in May just over 4 years ago. My belly was big; me and my hubby were so excited, and I felt the most amazing pressure - like you said - downward. It was actually terribly uncomfortable to sit (it was uncomfortable around my vagina and around my butt too which was surprising to me).    I'd say that after, oh an hour or so visiting, that I felt a little trickle. Then a big trickle. Then a gush! My water broke, and before the next evening, I held my little angel in my arms.    I know that pressure well, and it's most certainly a sign of labour coming soon!    I wish you so much luck!|`|xOvPuyfHaa	Sounds like you're baby is making it's way down into the canal! Good Luck!!|`|5H9woJT0aa	Its almost time so you will feel that,...........GOOD LCUK!!!!!!CONRAGULATIONS!!!!!!!|`|zezIM9B5aa	It sounds like he is making his way down the canal. I had increased pressure shortly before my son entered the world.|`|E7LSetRHaa	Sounds like you baby has dropped. You could be starting labor. Walk walk walk walk. This will help you dilate. Also do squats and roll your hips. It will loosen you up and help speed thing along. Nipple stimulation and intercourse is good natural ways to help too. Good luck and God bless.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	It's completely normal.  Your baby is most likely engaged in your pelvis and the pressure of his/her head is now very noticeable to you.  It is nothing to worry about.  Stripping your membranes can definitely begin the labor process.  Hang in there, you're almost done with the easy part!!!  ;)|`|bQk0vpfSaa	the baby is positioning to come out. YAY|`|7SKVCPcSaa	lots of pressure is a sign of approaching labor! yay! not too much longer|`|8d76f8b8e5f5db785811fc316c86ca44aa	Well it sounds like the baby is engaged well into the birth canal.  The pressure is normal but doesn't sound like labor.  You will more than likely feel some pain around your lower belly, lower back, some nausea, lose your mucous plug and feel your belly tightening.  Sounds like that baby of yours is just getting ready.  Good luck.
BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|i69nprxXaa	If you took a test and said you were ovulating congrats to you and hubby, because sounds like he hit the dot... Good luck to you...|`|TGzOrftPaa	Don't be too disheartened!  Pill users can take even 6 months to 1 year to become pregnant after taking it.  It takes awhile for your body to go back, even if you're ovulating and get periods normally.  It's ok!  You had sex at the most likely time for getting pregnant with a 30% chance.    The best advice I've ever read is not to get yourself worked up.  When you have sex for the passion part and not the sole purpose of conceiving you're more likely to let go of stresses.  Being stressed can actually inhibit likelihood of getting pregnant.  Take a deep breath, relax, and smile  =)  Take a test but don't be disheartened if it comes back negative.|`|qkNbcWjjaa	You have a pretty good chance.   Best of Luck and Baby Dust to you !

Good Job :)|`|AA11684972	Respectful, polite, asks questions to show they are interested in learning. So many kids are rude and mulish in class that its nice for a teacher to have a student that actually wants to be there and better yourself. Consider it a compliment to your child and the search for knowledge that you instilled in her.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	hmm i dunno i need to figure that out! haha|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	When they're me.  =]    A good student, always focused, never in trouble, homework in on time, you get it.
lGcpXteaaa	I had have the same thing! In fact i was just about to ask the same question about it.  I had a baby 9 months ago and ever since i have had 'phantom kicks'. They are most likely gas etc but i never felt anything like this before i gave birth to my daughter.  I actually thought i was pregnant last month and i had these 'kicks'...they reminded me just how my daughter used to kick.  It will be nice to see if anybody has any answers as to why we can feel them more after the baby than before.  Maybe we are just more aware of it now? I don't know....  x|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Yes that is normal. After I had both of my kids I would feel movements in my tummy and get excited thinking it was the baby moving but then realize 'oh wait I'm not pregnant anymore'. I also had the habit of having my hands always on my stomach when I was pregnant and after my kids were born I still did it all the time and people would ask me i I was pregnant because of how I was holding my tummy lol. Congrats on your baby by the way!|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	maybe you're pregnant and dont even know it|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Sounds like you are experiencing gas and digestive movement. It is just reminding you of the baby moving when it was inside you. Gas and baby movements are very much alike. This is why women think they are feeling there baby move as early as 10-12 weeks. Bc the feelings are so similar.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	"ghost movements"?|`|ry3yUnoaaa	Never had that experience. Are you sure that you're not pregnant again? Women are very likely to get pregnant again right after birthing a child. You can always go to your OB/GYN and ask if they have heard of anything like this. Remember they have heard of numerous cases like this.|`|hG8tLBSMaa	take an hpt just in case... sometimes you can still get pregnant on the pill/shot...
Do7M9ij3aa	You are not alone, sweetie!  This is very typical.  Your hormones are "plateauing"... meaning that the elation and excitment/anticipation of the new arrival is WEARING OFF... and the physical limitations are INCREASING.   The uneven balance of these two happenings can cause you do feel "Blue".      YOU ARE ALMOST DONE... and you are about to go through the greatest event of your life.  The blues will vanish, and in its place will be a precious baby of your very own.    CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ON YOUR PRECIOUS BABY... and remember that you WILL make it through this!  Keep your chin up!|`|IyxpXri6aa	I'm also 22, unplanned pregnancy, 35 weeks, and feel like this is never going to end. All the things people tell me to think positively about annoy me. I can't think of anything except baby and pregnancy stuff, and I just want to get on with my life. I want to start running again, and fit into my old cute clothes! Time is just crawling by though, but we're tough and we'll make it. Things will get better after the baby comes.|`|Qz3sii2caa	It's normal to feel depressed at any time when you're pregnant. Well not just depressed, really any intense emotional state it totally normal since the hormones are just everywhere. At 35 weeks your tummy is growing very quickly so you have a changing body to throw into the mix, anyone would feel a little under the weather.      Hang in there! Your baby will be here soon!
GYoNyoWtaa	Well right after I had my baby, I was more comfortable with working out at home, because I could be with him and I didn't have to worry about being starred at like I was still a fat lard. But I told myself once I lost a certain amount of weight I was going to go to the gym, and let Austin and my husband have "their time" together..while I had my time. It's been going great =)|`|6XSOVAh0aa	If you think getting to the gym is a better fit for you, then pump and let dad feed!  I worked out at home after, but I didn't breastfeed, either.  If you walk, at least you'll be doing something.  Working out at home will save money, but if you not worried about that then hit the gym!  I must say though, the only downfall of working out at home is, I always found reasons to put it off.  Maybe if I had paid for a membership somewhere, I would have worked out a little more since it was money already spent.  You don't want to be wasting money these days - especially with the new one here!
lCbsCM6raa	During her first delivery, her blood and the baby's blood mixed and her blood recognized the antigen and developed antibodies against them. However, the baby was born soon enough that those antibodies weren't able to attack the antigen and cause problems in the first baby. Now that she has those antibodies, when her body recognizes the antigen again (in the new baby's blood), they will attack it, which will cause problems to that baby. Does that make sense?
ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	You could have an ectopic pregnancy - have someone take you to the ER NOW! tell them you have taken a test but are concerned you may have an ectopic pregnancy. Left untreated it can kill you! Please get to the ER ASAP. Good Luck!|`|zu7lHvCdaa	I had cramps before I found out I was pregnant so i thought they were period cramps. Some woman don't come out positive till later its doesn't mean ur not pregnant ur HCG levels are probably too low to be detected still. listen to ur body  if u think ur pregnant wait it out and test again if the pain is too much and ur concerned go see another doctor no one knows ur body like u do...good luck!
lSY2JXnXaa	It is supposed to be family/son. I was a boy/cub scout master for 12 years. It was hard to get either parent of most kids to attend. So, attend and enjoy yourself. It is not gendered. If it was, our group of 83 boys would have never gotten off the ground, since I was a very active female. (yes, 83 in the poorest part of our town of cubs and boyscouts.)|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	In our pack, we've got a pretty good mix of men & women, both in leadership roles and as active parents.  In our immediate family, I'm more actively involved than dad (I'm cubmaster for the pack this year), but that's just because dad's not comfortable in social situations.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Cub Scouts used to be more father/son, but considering that the family structure has changed, so has scouts.  Now it is for the scout and whatever family member actually wants to take the time to be there.  True, there are still more dads than anything else, but there are also moms, grandpas, whatever.  My son is also 8, he is a Wolf Cub (or will be "officially" given his badge in March), and I (his mom) am the leader of the Den.  Of the parents in my group, I have another mom, two dads, and one little boy whose mom just drops him off and runs.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	When my brother joined the boys scout it was a mother/ son thing. But there were father/sons there to. And there were times when we all went.|`|AA11684972	Family/son. My son is in his 3rd year of scouts and I'm in my 3rd year as his leader. For us it started as a mom/son thing. He was my middle child (has a baby brother now) and has a sister older and younger. It was a chance for him to get some Mom time and for me to do stuff with him. Some of my families have the father do cub scouts and the mom do girl scouts. Others do both. My husband is great about helping with the derby or volunteering, but the normal responsibilities are mine.|`|AA10614558	Hello Karenn:     Scouting is a family activity. If one parent has a strength in an area (woodworking, cooking, crafts) try to schedule that parent to be with your Scout during a meeting requiring that skill. Both parents and siblings should be welcome at Cubbing activities.     Keep on Scoutin'
9yvK07MEaa	Well, keep in mind it is your child, its coming out of YOU so you get and your hubby get all the say-so you want. What is the name anyways? And keep in mind what you're mom thinks is a good name, and what your generation thinks is a good name are two totally different things, because as time goes on names change. Nobody names their children Gretchen or Mildred anymore, however, your grandparents/great-grandparents might like those names because they are older and those are the names that were more common back then. Ya know?|`|AA11138222	Do you not want even the people on here to know the name?    In the end, it is YOUR baby and YOU have to like the name. However, even if your husband says it's fine, it sounds like you know he doesn't like it, so you might want to take his opinion to heart, he is the father afterall.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	No we all get our names from four nerdy guys that loves comic book, sci-fi, fantasy, anime, and Japanese superheroes shows.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	uhhhh|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	That is how i wanted things to go with us also. See my name is Jessica and my husbands name is Jeremy so i wanted to name our son a "J" name so i named him Julian which i love his name and do not care what anyone thinks of it.  My mother-in-law would say things like this: "That is a black name" (I hate when people put color on names) or he will be made fun of cause it sounds like julie. After i named him what i had said do you know that witch would call him by his middle name which he never knew she was talking to him because we called him julian.    I seen it like this, i am the one that went through the pregnancy which was horrible (preterm labor, pre-eclampsia) no one else did and that right there gave me the right to name him what i wanted. I did not even listen to what my husband wanted to name him, i named him julian and that was the end of the story.    Dont worry about no one else. It is not their right to name anyone.|`|GAj9hwWvaa	Yes, I think everyone goes through this to a certain degree. Heck, my husband and I ended up playing 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' to name our son because we simply couldn't agree.     I think as far as your extended family goes, just let them think what they want. Eventually EVERY baby grows into its name and it seems as if it couldn't possibly be any other way. My sister named her daughter Mary, at the time I thought "eww, what a bland, boring name" but now it so fits her and looking back at the other names my sis was considering actually make me laugh, because Mary couldn't possibly be one of them.     Just go with YOUR gut and YOUR style and tell your family that if they don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all!!! Good luck!|`|knyjNiy0aa	Not everyone is going to like your babys name. Your mom might love a name that someone else will hate. Not everyone is going to like it's name. This is YOUR baby. Not hers. If she doesn't like it, then  that's just too bad. You can't satisfy everyone. It's your turn to satisfy yourself, this is your little precious.    Edit- I love Julian, I was considering that name for my baby :)|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My boyfriend hated the name I picked out for our daughter at first.  Then, he said the same thing as your husband....whatever you want it fine with me.    Now he loves her name!!!    I couldn't care less what anyone else thinks other than me and the father when it comes to baby names.  We're trying for another baby right now, and I have a name for a boy....he hates it lol.  I'm sure he'll warm up to it though :)|`|vwxmsUa2aa	I don't think it matters what your mother thinks. However, I wouldn't name your child that simply because your husband doesn't like it. Whether he lets you or not, I think it should be a name that you both like.|`|dTiWVBT7aa	Thats a really nice name! I dont know what your so worried about, i think its perfectly normal, i thought you were going to say something really weird. I know a guy called Julian, he is very good looking (and no he's not gay)
c93687d4de5b8ed908d264c10fe4e506aa	You can file your own petition at the courthouse in the county where she lives. Most likely the husband will be considered the legal father due to the marriage. Even though he is the legal father his rights will be limited. You will need to file against the mother stating there may be another possible father.     Getting a judge to get the test ordered is not that difficult. The custody and visitation that comes afterward may be more difficult.    As a man you will not get much help from the social services as they are extremely prejudice and favor mothers.     For filing fees (in Maryland and Delaware) I have paid $50 to $350 depending on which state and court. The testing (Labcorp) cost $630 for a mother/father/child test.    Your local courthouse will be able to tell you the filing fees. Try calling your local Civil, Family or Equity court. Talk to the Clerk of Court (or a deputy clerk) and ask if they have forms that you can fill out and file. Start saving money now as it will most likely take a month or more for the first hearing. Also ask about sheriff service of papers which is usually cheaper than private service.    Normally the basic steps are: File, Service of Papers (Writ of Summons), Response, hearing date set, hearing before a judge or judicial officer, order for the testing (here you will have to pay for testing upfront), testing, results of test filed with court, declaration of paternity (additional filing if you are father) and then visitation, custody and support.    It is a long process and even longer if they fight. The courts are use to certain procedures; if you file yourself research the proper steps to take for your state's laws and procedures.|`|zu7lHvCdaa	maybe u already did this but did u ask ur ex if it was ur child? im not a lawyer so the best thing I would say is when u go back be honest with them and tell them whats going on and that u need real solutions not the run around. unfortunately people in the legal Business deal with this kind of stuff all the time and could give a rats *** about you. my sister went through hell just to get shared custody of my nephew. Has the baby been born yet if not then u will have to wait obviously. all i can say is if u really think there is a chance the kid is yours don't give up!
FVD1tpLeaa	it seems to depend on the sperm banks.  Some i've seen cost about $200 to $400 a pop.  But I have to say, I haven't looked into that option alot, so I'm not completely sure.    Also, it would be much easier to do an at home insemination if you're familiar with the donor.  Cheaper as well.  Your donor would just need to get a semen evaluation so you know that you're dealing with good swimmers, and then you and your partner can inseminate at home.  There's many methods to it.    The best book I can recommend to you is The New Essential Guide to Lesbian Conception, Pregnancy, and Birth by Stephanie Brill.  It's indispensable in it's information.

prqrQcd1aa	Pot is marijuana, and there are many more benefits to it than to smoking tobacco. THC pills are given to patients that are terminally ill, cancer patients and so on, even in states where medical marijuana is not legal.. my state is pa, and i was taking care of a woman on marinol (the name of the THC pill). Smoking tobacco is worse for you because there are so many additives in it, there are none in weed. While smoking anything is bad for your lungs, have you ever heard of the main ingredient of tobacco being put into pills for patients?? NO, but the main ingredient that gets you high in weed IS.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	They get it from TV, magazines, friends & adults who aren't setting any examples for young kids|`|TM3pNz6kaa	A lot of people say that smoking marijuana is worse for you than smoking cigarettes.  This is untrue.  A lot of people claim that smoking one joint is like smoking five cigarettes, yet this "fact" is very misleading.  There are many facts to show that marijuana IS NOT worse than cigarettes.  Take a look at the facts:  You may have heard that one joint is equal to five cigarettes, but this is exaggerated and misleading. Marijuana does contain more tar than tobacco, but tar isn't the ingredient that leads to cancer and other diseases.  Low tar cigarettes cause just as much cancer as normal cigarettes.  Scientists have shown that smoking any plant is bad for your lungs, because it increases the number of `lesions' in your small airways.  This usually does not threaten your life, but there is a chance it will lead to infections. Marijuana users who are worried about this can eliminate the chances of infections by eating or vaporizing marijuana. Marijuana is completely safe to eat, yet tobacco is not.|`|GXVanwgPaa	i got half my info on drugs from my 6th grade teacher and the other half from stupid friends. however i personally don't think i have any brain cells to spare. i can't get into harvard w/ D's.|`|MjnXUBTaaa	thats true. i think you need to do some research.|`|Ts33DJSwaa	thats the point really, they dont, not from legitimate sources i have determined, friends, media, film, music, all from the wrong places, there is a website though that is dedicated to the re education of children, young people and adults about the truth and facts about drugs, they are helping the issue, the wensite is drug free international and their campaign is called unite against drugs...|`|402QyLglaa	they get it from each other.

7rCeCVl2aa	I have the same problem with my 8 month old. Just when we settle back in to the "norm" he gets sick or cuts a tooth. Right now we are dealing with pneumonia so he is up all the time and napping at weird hours... I'm sure it'll be weeks before we settle back in. Lord knows that'll only last a week tops and he'll cut another tooth or catch another cold and we'll be back to square one again...    I went through a lot of the same with my oldest and he is now 7. From experience I can say the whole first 1 year can get a bit shaky at times but eventually she will finally settle in to a final routine. That seems to be when things calmed down for me anyway... 4 more months to go! =)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i don't like cio  however, i do a modified 'fussing it out'  after a few mins of fussing, before she gets out of control , i go in and give her back her passy or whatever she needs....slightly longer each time, u can pat or rub their back for a min , but no talkng, eye contact, make it very boring; and whatever u do, do not give in bc that will make it ten times harder the next time; now she usually goes right to sleep, i may have to go in a time or two sometimes, but she knows i am there if she NEEDS something, but not if she WANTS something, like getting out of bed..she's 8 mos and it has worked well, and she doesn't cry herself to sleep as i couldn't do that to her...|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	I'm sure this won't be of much help, but my son had an awful teething time and hardly slept since birth as it was.  He hasn't had a nap since he was 12 months old and he is now 33 months old.  The only thing we did was to hold him and rock him and walk with him.  We took turns staying up all night with him, etc.  We also don't believe in the cry it out method.  We just continued to show our love and concern for him, and he eventually outgrew it.  He is almost 3 now and this past year has been so much easier since all of his teeth came in!  It's like night and day. So I don't really have any advice, just my sympathy!  I know how discouraging and frustrating it can be, but we just stayed calm (if you are stressed over it, baby will sense that and be worse) and reassured him we were there for him and that everything was okay.
OFLiR1dsaa	You need to sit down and talk to your mom about the situation. Have a plan ready and tell your dad what you are thinking. I'm sure she will understand, and if she doesn't want you to go she'll have a good reason for it too.     If you cannot go, just try and talk to your friend as much as possible. Sending her a card would be a very nice gesture to show how much you care.     Whatever happens, I'm sure your friend will get though this hard time, but you have to be there for her.

If your mom says you cant go maybe you can talk to the friend on the phone. Im sorry to say this but she probably has more friends close by.
7rCeCVl2aa	I had the same problem and I started using his socks to cover his hands. My MIL always joked with me and asked if he had 6 fingers or something because his hands were covered until he was about 4 months old!|`|pXSKSS3daa	File his nails as well as cutting them, or just file them instead of cutting them. This may help to get rid of any rough edges on his nails.    Unfortunately there isn't much else you can do. It's a phase and he'll outgrow it but will scratch his face up a lot before he does.|`|rAkWoweOaa	They have gowns that fold over their hands.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Continue to keep his nails short. I used the mitts on my daughter but she found it necessary to try & try & try until she got them off. I ended up using a sock which reached all the way up to her shoulder|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	cut its nls more often   get baby mittens|`|puCOYwMmaa	My mom used to put tube socks on my brother's hands.  They reach up his arm so he can't pull them off.  They're good for winter too.|`|tA7WDLm4aa	use socks.  It may look ridiculous but it works if the mittens are too small.|`|0AsL26sSaa	They have baby mittens, but those don't always stay on, you can use your babies socks, that is what I always did.|`|kWF6heS0aa	Try baby socks and talk to your pediatrician.  Hope it helps!|`|qHykYLQ6aa	My son did this too.  Eventually I stopped making a huge fuss about it.  When they are that age, the scratches heal so fast anyway.  You can speed up the healing also by putting on some shea butter (reduces scarring too).  I also would sometimes put socks on his hands, they stay on better than those mitts.|`|i8NOVfm0aa	you could try winter mittens lol if you are nursing put the milk on the cuts on his face and they will be gone the next day.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Try socks. They come in a variety of sizes.
PLK1p8cUaa	Just keep doing what you are doing.  The longer the baby stays in to it's due date the better.  It seems you are being monitored closely by your doctor.  Follow his/her recommendations and any warning signs he may have asked you to watch for.  Good luck, it is almost over.|`|yB5go5wbaa	don't induce sooner than necessary, your baby needs to be in there as long as possible.  the doctor knows what s/he's doing.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	look you need the baby out seriously sounds like you have pre-eclampsia if you wait to long you and your baby could die|`|MqFeJiukaa	It never hurts to ask but if the blood work is fine the dr will prob try to keep you pregnant or else he would have offered to induce you regardless.  I know you are prob anxious and tired of bed rest and I have been there and totally understand.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	37 weeks is considered "full term", but more time in the womb is always better. Your Dr will make the best decision for you and your baby given your test results. You can ask, but if the Dr thinks you can go an extra week, you really should.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	This same thing happened to me.  When you start to spill protein in your urine, it can mean your kidneys are being damaged.  DON'T WORRY.  This is why they check a pregnant women so closely during her pregnancy.  If your blood work come back bad, they will schedule you that day most likely.  If not, you will likely remain on bedrest 2 more weeks.  Personally I would ask about induction earlier, like maybe in one week.  The worst your doc can say is "No".  The baby is fine but your BP is not going to go down, it will only go up.  Delivery will help, but I had to take BP medicine for about a month after delivery (Procardia).  You'll be fine either way, just take it easy and follow your bedrest rules!!     PS...I lost about 30 pounds in one week after my baby was born.  I had retained so much fluid that I felt like I peed FOREVER every time I went to the bathroom!!! It was crazy!  :)|`|12bc27fa7b718990cbf3a82111b05148aa	I was induced at 36 weeks due to high bp.The doctor said there was an 80% chance that she would be developed enough, and indeed she was. Just a little small was all. I was happy to miss the last 4 weeks of pregnancy! However, I did hear about a girl who was induced a little early and it turned out that her due date had been miscalculated and so the baby came too early! Of course she was fine, but had to stay in the NICU. Anyway, all that to say that the longer the baby can stay inside of you, the better, and the doctor will probably not want to induce you now unless your blood work is bad and they have to get the baby out.|`|BCmyTUSlaa	I'm no medical professtional, but I'm 35 weeks and I recently had protein in my urine. Don't get yourself too worked up. High protein may just mean you were alittle dehydrated that day. I'm not so sure you can request to be induced, but I do know that at 37 weeks, you considered full term. I wish you the best!!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Try to hang in there.  The longer you can keep that baby in, the better.      That being said, I know how stressful this is.  I had high bp with my first baby (but no protein).  They watched me closely, and my water broke on its own right on my due date.  Unfortunately, contractions didn't start on their own, so I had to be induced, and 29 hours later, ended up with a c-section.      With babies  2 and  3, I developed high bp again and also had protein in my urine.  I was induced at just shy of 38 weeks both times and delivered 7 1/2-pound babies, so they were a good size.    All three of my children were healthy, and my blood pressure did go back to normal within a month or two after delivery.  I was on bp meds during the end of my pregnancy and for about a month after with baby  2, and for about a month after delivery with baby  3.      One thing to be careful of is that your bp can spike within the first week after delivery, so be sure to call your doctor if you have a bad headache.  I was readmitted to the hospital 4 days after baby  3 was born b/c my bp was climbing, and I had a pounding headache.  Thankfully, my bp came down on its own, but they did keep me overnight for observation.    Take good care of yourself this next few weeks, and try to hang in there.  You'll be holding that sweet baby in your arms before you know it.  Good luck with your delivery!
HXfHkoSHaa	Spilling proteins means that you have protein in your urine.  It could be a sign of preeclampsia, and your doc will most likely want to keep a close eye on you.  I had this with my first pregnancy.  I was told to drink a lot more water and really take it easy.  The next time I was tested, it was fine.|`|qX8EFFVtaa	Yes it is the same thing.  When you spill protein in your urine, it means the little blood vessels in your kidneys "leak" usually due to  high blood pressure.  This also happens to the blood vessels in your legs (everywhere really) which causes swelling.  I was able to press large dents in my legs with my finger, and the dents would stay there for several minutes.  This is called pitting edema. Pre-eclampsia is high blood pressure AND excess protein in the urine, and the only way to treat it is to deliver the baby.  Pre-eclampsia is progressive but it can either progress fast or slow.  The farther along in pregnancy you are, the less problematic it is.  If someone is diagnosed with it earlier (around 20 weeks) it can be very dangerous to both the mother and the baby.
A5mkPwIqaa	Well, you will probably need to have a background check and a physical exam. For the background check, you fill out a paper your employer gives you and then get fingerprinted. For the physical exam, the doctor just checks you over to make sure you're able to care for children.
2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	I am sorry that the Nuvaring has caused problems in your cycle. Depo-Provera also can affect your cycle for up to 24 months after the final injection. Your body may still be adjusting to the Depo-Provera. I am confused though, why your OB would put you back on Nuvaring after seeing how your body is having such a terrible time adjusting. Not only that, but with it still in, you are effectively preventing pregnancy until it is removed... and it is a safe (although unfortunate) assumption that once it is removed, you will still have trouble with your cycles.    You will need to remove the Nuvaring in order to get things started on the right track, even if you stop having regular periods. A regular period is no good when on birth control. Some people never have regular cycles and get pregnant naturally. Even having sex twice a week gives you good odds when your cycle is unpredictable. Others find medical intervention is necessary. Don't worry too much over the irregular cycles (or lack thereof) and let your doctor know you are trying for a baby so they can take appropriate steps.    I say... get that Nuvaring out and get to making a baby as soon as you wish! I wish you all the best!
DsLx6Sixaa	IYou sound like you are a mature and responsible kid, and it is great to be prepared but 13 years old is way too young to be using birth control. Remember that most forms of birth control will not protect you from a sexually transmitted disease. How will you explain that to your parents? Would you want to get something now that is with you the rest of your life?    The only form of birth control which will protect you from both pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases is the condom. There are condoms for men and condoms for women.    As I said, you sound responsible. So, either wait a few years or else use a condom.|`|lEOHZbQgaa	First of all, cheers to you for being responsible enough to realize that something like that might happen.   But I believe that it's free, if they won't give it to you and you don't want to tell your mother - most dermatologists prescribe it for acne.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I believe it's free and anonymous|`|84lm1rXZaa	Honestly hun ..   don't give it up to your bf.  just because he says if you love me you will give it up no no   sweet heart threes plenty of time for sex think before you act . sex is something very special and you want to share it with someone who's really special. because if you do  it, and people in your school find out and I'm being brutally honest there gonna start calling you names and wont look at you the same wait until your truly and do it with someone you know that gonna be there for awhile..  so take my  advice.  but to answer yer question.  all you need id your health card..
AHCtDhUcaa	Ok. Your diet sounds pretty good. And don't just do this to look good on you 15th party... but do it for yourself and your health. It doesn't mean you cannot eat a few "junk-foods" here and there... just balance everything out. Perhaps you will lose 30 pounds (not sure) . Jog every other day too. But make healthy choices (like you are with the fruits and everything) Be happy with yourself too. And have fun at your quince :)|`|lvJUDy78aa	Congrats on your new lifestyle! It takes a lot of determination to do such a thing. You are going about it just great. More exercise and a healthier diet will ensure a healthier body!    Just a few pointers I have found in my day:    -Do a workout routine that works for you. If you don't like to run flights of stairs then don't do it. If you like to jumprope, then do that. Enjoy your workout!    -losing weight does not necessarily mean eating less! Just cut out the bad things and do what mom and dad have always taught you "eat healthy" Eating healthier means your body can produce the natural hormones to make you energetic, happy, and shapely.     -try your best to keep to a routine. Once a routine (like exercising) is broken, sometimes it is easy not to return...    -There is no set amount of weight you will lose on a given month. Just weigh yourself once a month. Weighing yourself too much will just stress you out since everybody wants 'fast' results. Keep it up and scale yourself sparingly and you will see results!    -Lastly, it takes some time to start seeing results, but you'll see that once you start to see results in yourself, you will see rusults faster. Like the proverbial snowball effect!    Good luck with yourself!|`|UEN70BMYaa	I think if you do that than you might loose a few pounds.|`|0Zm9gI4paa	Sounds like a good start. You definitely want to exercise and jump rope is really strenuous so that's great to do. You can also try lifting 5- or 2-pound weights to tone your arms.    As for food, it's ALWAYS better to eat fruit than soda and chips. But make sure you have other snack foods too that can be better substitutes when you're really craving sweets, like granola bars, 100-calorie packs (but be sure to just eat ONE at a time!), Honey Nut Cheerios, etc. It really helps me to measure out a portion before I eat so I don't just keep reaching mindlessly into the bag. And it's important to EAT SOMETHING when you're hungry! If you let yourself get too hungry you'll feel entitled to gorge yourself later on.    Good luck! Just remember your goal when you feel stuck...you'll feel great at the end if you stick to your plan.|`|AA10702882	The key to working out is mixing it up consistently, so you can avoid the plateau effect.   I recommend a cycle of daily brisk walking (45 minutes to an hour), rotated day-to-day with pilates.   Drinking more water and cutting out sodas will definitely help. Try to drink as much water as you can throughout the day. Carry water bottles with you to school (one or two) and it will help you keep full. Also, when you have cravings and are hungry, snack on an apple or an orange. Also, nuts are filling and healthy for you.  Whenever you drink or eat something, ask yourself if it's good AND nourishing. I can relate because I use to just diet and exercise to lose some weight, but eating healthy and exercising on a regular basis will make you feel great all the time!  Good luck, I really hope you do well :)|`|Mzjoeld4aa	losing weight is hard but maybe if you stick to ur plan you might lose a few pounds but maybe when you have time add another work out plan like running (dont wanna be to careful when it comes to losing weight)|`|PHY2vd6baa	be happy with your body....and if you really want to lose weight do a cardio work out...which means running....NOT WALKING!!
wzXJOSIeaa	You don't have to be with him but you do need to give him a chance to be in your baby's life. He is the father and it is his right to be there for the baby. And you wouldn't want your child growing up without a father would you?|`|Bs8sllD9aa	until the baby is born he has no rights to it. You don't have to let him there if you don't want him there.

YjwnT5Oiaa	why is this in baby and toddler?
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Maybe last time they just assumed you were getting them on your own. I would definitely be taking a prenatal vitamin every day. Your body is under a lot of demands growing the baby and it's better for you both if you take them.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Take them! It can't hurt anything it will only help. Prenatal vitamins have things like folic acid in them to help your baby's spine to form right. The iron pills are so that you don't become anemic while you are pregnant.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	all mothers who are caring or trying to consive should take their prenatal pills. if not the baby could take a lot of nutriton from you and make you look like an old lady with no teeth. FOLIC ACID is the most important thing for a baby while he or she is growing..|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	I've always heard prenatal vitamins are for the mother, the baby takes what it needs from you depleting your vitamins. But yes they are good for you, will help your hair and nails grow nice through pregnancy.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	definitely take them! It is healthy for you and your baby. I have no idea why they didnt give them to you last time, but get them asap so you will have a healthy pregnancy.|`|V2PDiV9Uaa	What kind of pills? Vitamins? If vitamins, then yeah take those things religiously. A balanced diet rich in good veges and meats will give you plenty of nutrition, but most people don't eat too well during pregnancy because of nausea, so vitamins are a good idea. They make sure your baby gets what it needs and make sure your body doesn't get too worn down nutritionally. If taking them in the morning makes you want to puke, taking them later in the day may help.|`|DutTBV3caa	i would take them if i were you. they just give you extra vitamins that help your baby. i dont know why they didnt give you them with your first. thats kinda weird|`|OLW0Irbhaa	It is essential to take prenatal vitamins and eat well (lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, veggies, lots of water, low-fat/skim milk) to ensure proper nutrition for you and your unborn baby.  Proper nutrition on board before you get pregnant is ideal to help prevent certain birth defects.|`|QSodlfMraa	you should take them honey.
rVnTnuU1aa	For you to not be hired based upon pregnancy would be discrimination. If you were told prior that you would be hired and then you dont, i would look into this further as well as contacting the placement agency  to look into this further.|`|PumYhJSvaa	If they have already offered you the contract they cannot take it away unless that have a valid reason. Pregnancy is not one of them.|`|LydL7EN6aa	if shes says no. ask her why be honest with her? as for your mother in law... i would be telling hubby not to tell her $h!t unless you want her to know. that is absolutely ridiculous and messed up of her to do that!!!|`|PyUDK9IGaa	you could quit or go on medical leafs|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Man that's awful. She shuold have no said anything. Let her know that since she told people that it might have cost you a job. That way she might feel bad enough to not run her mouth again. Now you know better than to tell her things.|`|sMSXWPWgaa	If they've given you the contract already I hope you've signed it and given it back.    If they haven't you are in a sticky situation as working for an agency they can terminate your employment for no reason.    I'm really sorry you're in this situation, but remember that you need to not stress out, but enjoy this time as much as you can.   If you haven't signed the contract yet and you know this woman knows, your best policy is to ask to speak with her asap and come clean. If she knows already your honesty can only make you look better. Say you would very much like to keep your job, show how well you've worked and fitted in, Basically sell yourself as best you can. Then you can only leave it in her hands.     Prob best not to tell you mother-in-law anything first again!|`|GSxUQbDMaa	stupid mother-in-law... i bet she's gonna back stab you many times :o  Just stay calm... try to lie about your pregnancy or something... say you got a miscarriage :P then when you get the contract signed you can pretend that you actually had twins, one died, one stayed alive... i dont know hahaha|`|HXr2Qeiraa	1. There's nothing you can do about it now, so try your best to stop worrying. It's best this lady knows, you wouldn't have wanted her to think you deceived her to get the contract. Never burn those bridges for short-term gains.    2. Your future mother-in-law is a b*tch.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Well, in the US it's against the law to fire or fail to hire someone because they are pregnant.  It's discrimination.  If things were going fine & you are doing your job & suddenly the boss says no way to keeping you on...then you are within your rights to find an attorney.  Just find an attorney that will do a free consult.    As for your mother in laws lack of respect for your wishes...been there done that!  Only, it was my father in law.  He was NOT supposed to know.  But his wife had just died & my husband felt like it would give him a little lift to know that I was expecting.  Within 12 hours every person he knew...KNEW.  The kicker was that I still hadn't told my mother about the pregnancy.  I was so worried she would find out 'through the grapevine'.  And that meant I had to tell her quickly...and I had been trying to wait for the right time.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	you should comfront your soon to be mother in law because it was not her place to spill the beans|`|8fbd82f04b9ceeeda329cb7ba7bafcd7aa	You poor thing!

In future, if you want to keep something secret 'DON'T TELL ANYONE'!|`|bMvAmMTaaa	sorry to hear that you didnt get to tell everyone your good news, i know how that feels.    i think there is a chance that your mother-in-law has ruined this career for you, as many employers try not to employ pregnant women, although by law, you must tell your employer current or new, your situation and it's up to them what they do. just be happy you are pregnant and try and find another way for income if this falls through...but you never know, she might not say anything and you might still have this job.    good luck xx|`|sM2U5kgraa	hey your not sure shes not going to give you the contract so take a chill pill.. and relax try to think positive.. god helps those who help themselves|`|zoyw8CRKaa	Im sorry that your mother inlaw did this its so unfair and certainly not her place!!! to have said a goddam thing ):-/    The woman in charge can sack you for another reason but the tribunal people will take this into consideration and they certainly don't think highly of sex discrimination.    If she does come up with some other poor excuse (lets be fair that's what it will be) you are well within your rights to take it further, and with the situation this happened in i think your rights are on your side..... see how it goes tomorrow if it turns out the way your scared it will i would certainly take it further coz its wrong wrong wrong lol.    Would love to know how this goes.    Congrats on the baby and i hope everything goes ok for you. xx
TdF6QLawaa	Be careful.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Yes it's okay to ski at this stage of your pregnancy, take care though - it gets dangerous in your later stages due to your balancing of weight and then you risk more falls.|`|YpxGfmdKaa	Just ask  your doctor. Your getting different answers here but your doctor is the best person to ask. Better to be safe than sorry !|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Um...I wouldnt risk it.  There is no need to have a bad fall, and put the baby at risk|`|K6KeN7sgaa	It is perfectly safe as long as going skiing is something you would normally do. In other words, were you physically fit before the pregnancy?    Runners and joggers and swimmers and hikers are told by their Ob-Gyns to continue in their regular physical routines when they get pregnant, in order to have the healthiest, fittest pregnancy and baby.    If you were fit before the pregnancy, then you most definitely should go skiing.    If you've been sitting on the couch for 10 years, then NO, don't go.|`|32zBW5uCaa	NO.  Most miscarriages occur in the first trimester.  A fall could cause you to lose the baby.|`|mPIOOUtDaa	http://www.pregnancy.org/question/can-i-...     This Will tell you everything you need to know. These people suggest (No)|`|AA11151733	personally i think it is at 6 weeks its well protected|`|tu7aqUoxaa	no|`|AA12094998	probably not...the altitude can cause oxygen problems unless you always live at that altitude|`|8WRnqs08aa	During pregnancy, it is not advisable to take part in any activities that could put your unborn baby at risk. Personally, I would not take the risk.|`|ec505b9bfac1af14a0ebfaeef28d6657aa	Ask your OBGYN what they think. Personally I would not take the chance. I think I would drink cocoa by the fire in the lodge instead.|`|6ij0XZLDaa	as long as your a good skier and dont run into something? Espeacially if you get hit in the stomach its still dangerous..im no dr but it sounds like common sense to me|`|X0xHXDcTaa	I wouldn't recommend doing anything that physical when pregnant. One good tumble, jolt on ur abdomen, anything could happen. I would just think about the life in you as more important and schedule skiing for after delivery!
uFrqC4Y2aa	being late with cramps is definately a "sign".|`|cZksfFKFaa	thats how I figured out I was pregnant. I kept feeling like I was getting my period but it just never came. And my boobs didn't hurt at all, i just had sore nipples. Take a test!|`|hoX7hoINaa	You could be pregnant, take a test. Only way to find out.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	it could just be a late period. i remember before i got pregnant that when i was going to start my period that my boobs did feel painful but didnt "hurt" give it a few more days and if you do not have your period buy a pregnancy test!|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	Sometimes I think Periods can be late for so many reasons other than pregnancy. I remeber I was totally worried because my chest was so sore to touch and it was only pre menstrual. Give it another few days and try not to stress as this will delay your period alot more! I hope you get what you wish for and that I have helped in some way. Take care x|`|xFt1O80paa	i would take a test asap or go to the doctor    sound like what i had, the first sign for me was tightening, and sharp pains in my boobs and stomach.    good luck!!!
HclKftzAaa	When i first got pregnant, i KNEW i wasn't as far along as they were saying i was, so i insisted on an early scan to have the pregnancy dated.    Do you know when your last period was? Or were you too irregular to date the pregnancy off that? If you had a scan before 12 weeks (usually around 8 weeks is good) then i would go by the due date that that scan gave you.    If they have to keep bringing your due date earlier because the baby is 'bigger than expected' then they should test you for gestational diabetes.    Due dates are approximate anyway. The only real worry here is that they will think you're further along than you are and try to induce you early. If they want to induce you, see if you can put them off for another week or so unless the baby is getting 'too' big.    I'm due in April  too. With the sciatica, pelvic pain, water retention and gestational diabetes, i am SO ready to meet this baby already! lol. Ok, bored of being pregnant now, want the baby!    I just want to get on with it! Lol.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	due dates are just estimates...|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Ultrasounds are used to help determine a due date when unsure because of the growth and development of the baby. But keep in mind that a due date is an estimate plus or minus two weeks is still considered good. So it is possible that you may be a week or two farther along, you will know when your little one decides to come. But as far as I know there is no test like a pregnancy test to determine due dates. They just go by your last period and ultrasounds.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	The ultrasounds are normally pretty accurate so I would say that if it's not exactly correct it's very close.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	u can always go ask a different doctor but i would make sure your insurance is ok with it.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	the best time to tell how far along you are is with an ultrasound when its still an embryo, the developmental stages are more distinct then and thats when they determine the due date, around 10 wks|`|tu7aqUoxaa	try going to www.babyzone.com and enter your due date or your lmp and it will estimate it for you|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Except for the size of your baby, there is no exact way to know, unless you know the date you conceived.    When the doc measures your belly, or the baby, it can be a helpful guess.  But even with an ultrasound measurement, the due date can be off as much as 2 weeks.    I would just suggest preparing everything as early as possible, so that if you are further along than anyone realized, you will be ready.  "Feeling huge" is pretty common, though!  So don't sweat it too much.|`|hoX7hoINaa	When you have/had your ultrasound, they base it off how they are measuring. If everything measured up then, they usually tell you by that info how far along you really are. And baby will have growth spurts as well.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	A lot of people tell me that I'm not so big. But then again a lot of people tell me I am, once I tell them that I only need a month they say that i'm fine. But i feel huge. usually with the ultrasounds they could tell how far along are you. Pregnancies are all different.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Just trust the ultrasound it is always right with the due date.
7uqOSZNKaa	no it doesnt mean youve missed it, it means u are approaching ovulation or u have ovulated. the stretcy egg white mucus helps the sperm up the cervix and is the perfect atmosphere for it x get on wi that baby dance hun xx lol xx i always cringe when i think of the mucus situation, but i swear by it. i had been ttc for months b4 i found this out and soon as i got used to the mucus signals i got pregnant. unfortunatley my pregnancy ended due to what i think was a cord accident but im gna be using this method to help me next time i try again x|`|SeAvCGlYaa	Any time you have much more mucous than usual a couple weeks after your period, especially if it is the texture you described, you are ovulating! Good luck!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It means she is just about to or just did ovulate and to have sex NOW in order not to miss it, eggs live 24-48 hours after ovulation.|`|ikPKFCscaa	No you were ovulating then when you got it or you will be ovulating maybe a couple of days after that.  But you doing the BD on the 19 really helped.  Lots of Baby dust to you *******
HclKftzAaa	It sounds like you are dehydrated. Not getting enough water can contribute to cramps, headaches, AND braxton hicks.    Make sure to eat small meals frequently throughout the day to help quell the nausea.    Apart from that, you're in the third trimester, you're supposed to be feeling tired and crabby. I am, and i don't even have to work! I have to get up to pee twice a night, and everytime it takes forever to go back to sleep. I think my body is gearing up for getting up every 3-4 hours for the baby. But i'm only 30 weeks! I wish I could sleep really well now been as i wont be able to soon!    Also, i don't think the doctors should HAVE a set cut off point for working. They should be looking at each case individually and making the right decision for each patient. Go in and see them and explain all this to them, hopefully they'll see reason.|`|LKbMSajFaa	Cant you go on to maternity leave? am 32 weeks pregnant and have been on maternity leave for 3 weeks now.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	i think that you should talk to your doctor and tell him how you feel. im 32 1/2 weeks with twins and im also 20 years old. although im carrying twins and its different because its high risk, i was put on bed rest at like 29 weeks. i was pulled off work because of how i felt.   you need to talk to your doctor and also talk to your work.   you shouldnt be on your feet that much!!|`|rx0ekB9Paa	thats really all up to your doctor. he might and then he might not. with the move u shouldnt be lifting anyways and with work try better shoes if u cant get off work.|`|VaA74PCZaa	They should.|`|YbFVdqbnaa	cant hurt to ask.|`|eMDnLUpqaa	The only person who could answer that is your doctor. I would say it is important to let him or her know all of that any way.|`|8AItzF9Laa	Yes I do|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Maybe, you should ask them.|`|IdReJpTjaa	i think you should go to the doctors and explain i think they will b happy to write you off|`|rURYaq45aa	i think they would let you off when you tell them that you are having problems doing things and you are getting tired much more. you should just try talking to your doctor and see what happens|`|hoX7hoINaa	If you tell your doctor that work is too much for you, they will go with your wishes. My doctor asked me at 31 weeks because I had braxton hicks and pressure on my pelvis. I'm still at work because I can't afford it, but they go by your wishes.|`|U5gixzszaa	yes i think so|`|Nc8ePm5vaa	speak to ur midwife...i had to be signed off at 25 weeks on full pay cause there is a law that states if u current job is affectin ur health or safety of u or ur baby then u must be found alternate work...if alternate work can not be found then be suspended on FULL pay...... the best info site is workingfamilies.org.uk the maternity rights fact sheet. they will also give u free advice over the fone regarding ur health and safety whilst workin and ur rights...i had to ring them a few times...im a nurse and i could not manage the shifts or the standing as i had spd due to pregnancy and of course i couldnt stand and working as a nurse they couldnt offer me a sitting down or alternate job so i was suspended on full pay at 25 weeks....my normal maternity leave then commences at 36 weeks....ave a look at this site there is loadsa info..u dont realise actually how many rights u do ave whilst pregnant.....  good luck xx|`|dDVAUA9saa	You'll have to ask them.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	maybe, ask|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Im not sure but let your doctor know that you cant function the same way you used to that your constantly in pain. Lets see what he tells you. I know my mom did it and she was only 20wks pregnant. Were in California so idk if its the same where your from.|`|5589fbd695adfa2721fe85c5288a8fb9aa	best go to them and ask, if your really struggling i'm sure they would!|`|i0DBIVc9aa	I just had my first child and i was 21 when she was born. i didn't know what to expect and no one told me what to do. if you tell your doctor that your stressed out at work then he will help you out a little. if you don't ask then you will never know. i had the same problem...so i asked my doctor and she said ok.|`|79rfx9gOaa	I would definitely ask. I was working 2 restaurant jobs with my 1st pregnancy, so I know the difficulty it can cause. Definitely talk to your doctor. Your job is important, but it shouldn't jeopardize the health of your child.|`|Omixzxe9aa	go to your doctor explain what you are like and ask him to give you a sick note and he will although they say 36 wks that is only a guide and the doctor will use his discretion if you are at risk of causing a problem to yourself or the baby.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	i think its time for you to go on maternity leave|`|buoqtZeFaa	I think your doctor give you a note for leave early if you explain how you feel and tell the doctor that you are worried about the safety of you child    Good Luck!|`|jwEqwoTxaa	my doc put me on bedrest at 30 weeks because I was stressed at work and it was causing me to dialate early. Just ask them, I am sure they will do whats best for you and the baby|`|75NM6Zhtaa	I am not sure if you wil be allowed to ask for a 'sick line' my daughter in law was in a very heavy job with her first baby, eventually the midwife had to make her stop work ,as she was not at all well,seemingly the statutory maternity pay can start when you want it to after a certain length of time,assuming your are entitiled to it.  If you are in UK you can check out info on ACAS web site we found that very helpful at that stressful time.  However as a mother of three it sounds as though you are indeed overworking and being on|`|0TrvUZPGaa	yes they should its not healthy take some time of and relax im sure you deserve it :) Best of luck
j083iujcaa	I found out at my 18 week sonogram. you can tell earlier by heartbeats but they always found one right off the bat with the doppler.  I also didn't go in for my first appointment till 12 weeks|`|MtC3CWZraa	You would be measuring large at your monthly appointments well before now, never mind dopplers or u/s.     If you're using a home model and hear to heartbeats, one is probably yours.|`|s1utniuvaa	I found out at 6 weeks|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	i found out i was having twins at 7 weeks. you would know by now if you were having multiples.  and yes, you can hear both heartbeats by 12 weeks|`|hoX7hoINaa	The heartbeats are usually heard if there's more than one. Get an ultrasound to be sure.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	yes you usually cna find out if your caring multiples by like the first doctors appointment.   the doctor should have been able to hear two different heart beats.  Good luck on that,|`|tmh42R6Caa	You could know immediately with an ultrasound.  I have multiples in my family so they did an ultrasound at 5 weeks.|`|jwEqwoTxaa	they could probably hear the heart beats by now if it was two. Congrats!
5yAsj29Vaa	Yes, they are.  The baby needs all of those vitamins and minerals to develop properly.|`|vue9NOhYaa	They are a bit of extra insurance.  Obviously they aren't vitally necessary, or nature would have arranged for prenatal vitamins to grow on trees ...    If you've been eating a pretty balanced diet, you and baby should be fine. If you're a poor eater, it would be wise to either improve your diet or take the vitamins, or both.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Kind of, the folic acid helps protect the developing embryo from spina bifida, but you should be taking it BEFORE you get pregnant for that.   As for the rest, it's important for you as the fetus will get what it needs from your body, and anemia from low iron levels will put your life, and your fetus' life at risk as you could easily bleed out during delivery if you are anemic.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If you are eating pretty decently they are actually more important for you than they are for the baby. The baby will get its nutrition through your reserves, but if you aren't taking a vitamin, it will leave you with little for yourself. This could cause all kinds of things to happen like hair loss, nail breakage, muscle cramps, anemia, etc. It's better to just take them. They say it's most important in the second and third trimester also.     Also, the folic acid is really important. If you don't get enough of that it can cause the baby to have spina bifida. Not good.  I had a hard time remembering to take mine so I put them next to the toothpaste so when I brush my teeth in the morning, they are right there.|`|OQdPzl15aa	The reason most Ob's tell women to take prenatal vitamins, is because they don't know what diet the mother has and just assume she doesn't have the best one.  If you have a really good and healthful diet, they aren't that important, but they also can't hurt.  Women long ago didn't take prenatal vitamins and their babies turned out just fine.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	the baby is going to  get what it needs, whether he gets them from the vitamins or he robs them from you stores, ( a common one is calcium - baby can rob it from your teeth or your bones and weaken them)    my mom didnt have any prenatal care with me, absolutly none until she went to the hospital to have me. i dont think she had a very healthy diet either, but i did turn out okay.    the omega 3 fat oils are important for the brain dev. that is something i know i didnt get enough of so i like to take them just in case and to stay healthy|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	yes they are really important to the baby...|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	YES!! You should have started taking them as soon as you found out you were pregnant. They contain many vitamins and minerals essential for baby to grow and develop properly as well as keeping you healthy especially if you are having morning sickness and not able to eat much.|`|MtOSX19Haa	I stopped taking prenatals with my first because I couldn't afford them.  He turned out just fine.  He is smart and has great hand eye coordination and is above average in size.  He is two and a half.  With this pregnancy, I started taking them and they tasted so awful I just stopped taking them.  I really don't put a lot of merit in them.  What do you think women did hundreds of years ago?  I eat right, drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep and I exercise a little.  As long as you think about what you are putting into your body you and your baby will be fine.|`|myEwHgI1aa	They are more important because YOU need them, baby will take from your body, and leave you without...do yourself and your baby a favor and get some prenatal vitamins. Mention to your doctor that you haven't been good at remembering them so they can make a note of that.
1z3C0R2Vaa	Just tell them you were sick but you feel a little better now.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Say I've been under the weather lately and hope to feel good any day now.|`|rPbyDmjYaa	I don't blame you for not saying anything.  I told everyone and a week later i had a miscarriage.  Sometimes its best just to hold off.  I know that when my husband and I get pregnant again its going to be extremely difficult to tell my best friend of 22 years.  But that is because she is seeing a fertility specialist and she just keeps getting more and more bad news.  Yesterday she was told she would only have a 37% chance of getting pregnant, even if she does she has a very low chance of carrying it full term.  So I would wait for the 12 weeks to be up and then tell everyone.|`|wLLylvN2aa	just say you haven't been feeling well, its telling the truth without giving details. I understand wanting to wait to tell people especially with you just having a miscarriage.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Just tell them you have not been feeling well or that you've had another obligation. Seriously, people are so nosy, it's none of their business. :/    I'd wait to tell them about the pregnancy until you feel comfortable about it.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	It's none of their business and if you don't want anyone to know then don't tell them. This is a private matter and tell them exactly that "It's a private matter"|`|hoX7hoINaa	Just tell them you haven't felt well. Keep it quiet until after the first trimester, since you've already been through miscarriage before.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	You don't have to give explanations to anyone, but if you really have to just tell them the truth.|`|jSGRiA8Jaa	explain how u have not been feeling well but dont tell anyone cause that happened to my mom also and she lost it so dont tell anyone for a while and it is healthier and better luck|`|tu7aqUoxaa	try to go and run to the bathroom whenever it is necessary|`|M6nN2STKaa	This is a very difficult situation. First, I'm sorry  that you had to go through something as tramatic as that, god bless you for trying again. As for people at church asking where you have been I agree with the others tell them you have been feeling "under the weather" or you may be swamped with personal family business. You should never be made to expose anything you don't feel comfortable with. Good luck girl! I'll pray for you.|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	Dont be in any rush to tell anybody anything. Afterall, this situation is quite personal until the persons ready to tell. I wish you the best of luck and Im sure everybody else will too! xxx
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I think some light bleeding is sometimes normal in early pregnancy but I would go to the hospital again if I were you.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I would advise u to go to the doc and tell them to do a sonogram to make sure the baby is okay. Light bleeding in the first trimester is normal and happens with nothing else being wrong however since ur having pains I would get it checked out just in case. Better safe than sorry.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	go and see a doctor a.s.a.p|`|8WRnqs08aa	It's a 50/50 situation.    Either you are suffering from a misscarriage, which I did @ 13 weeks in 2006, or it could be considered normal for you.    My last pregnancy in 2008, I experienced spotting up through the 16th week. I was pregnant with twins, but one demised. Therefore, the spotting I feel was due to the demise of the twin - I delivered one healthy baby girl in June.    Currently, I am 8 weeks 3 days pregnant without any difficulties. Whew, as I was fearful the entire 9 months during my last pregnancy.    Good Luck to you and I pray your symptoms resolve & you continue a healthy pregnancy.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	that doesnt sound right, an ultrasound should show if you are miscarrying|`|hzlqCBWnaa	when i was 11wks i started spotting bright red blood and back pain. well i went to the hospital and everything was fine. but the terrible period pain cramps dont sound like a good sign. the more you cramp and bleed the more likly your going to miscarry. i would say keep your legs up and if you start to bleed like a period go to the ER.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Go to the doctor just to make sure.|`|xrTcAHqzaa	Better start procreating again.|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	call your doctor hun, very important.|`|jwEqwoTxaa	dont freak out, but go to a doctor. Its probably nothing but you need to be sure!|`|aaZ0cTdCaa	I would go see a doctor ASAP. Spotting can be normal, but if you are having bad cramps, that can definitely be a concern.|`|36IsVhu5aa	bleeding is common especially if light during the first trimester..but the cramps should make u worry.. go to the doctor and let him perform an u/s and check ur baby's heartbeats..they might be able to give u shots to save ur pregnancy if anything wrong is happening.. once u see blood no matter what the color is, u should see ur doctor asap.. blood during pegnancy of any amount or color is dangerous!! praying for the best to u and ur baby.GL

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Babies usually start to learn the pincer grasp right around 8 months, so that's a good age to start finger foods like Cheerios.  You can certainly let her try to pick up a couple things now and keep a close eye on her, but she's probably still a little young.      Also, know that babies will definitely gag on different foods, but that doesn't mean that you need to do anything to help them.  If you see her start to gag, give her a second to cough the food up on her own, and try not to panic so that you don't worry her.  It's normal to gag when they're learning to handle all these new foods and textures.    Finally, babies don't need teeth to eat solids.  You'd be surprised at how much they can chew with their gums.  My youngest didn't get any teeth at all until over a year, but he was eating almost everything we were at that point (with the exception of apple/grape peels, tougher meats, raw carrots/celery/lettuce, etc.).  We just always gave our kids pea-sized bites of things at first so that if they didn't chew well, they wouldn't choke either.    Have fun starting finger foods with your little one (and be prepared for the mess  :-)  )!|`|N6vEZVNEaa	NOW BUT MAKE SURE IT IS IN SMALL PIECES|`|Bs8sllD9aa	they say no finger foods until they have i think 4 teeth. If your baby was to choke put her in your one arm upside down with face facing the floor and start hitting a little lower than the shoulder blades.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I started finger foods at 7 months, yogurt melts by Gerber are great ones to start with because they melt in the mouth and are easier to chew.  My son had 8 teeth by 7 months tho, so food was easy for him to chew anyhow.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	when she gets her first teeth|`|vue9NOhYaa	Teeth don't matter. She can have finger foods when SHE is able to eat them. (Pick them up, put them in her mouth, and gum them up.)  If she IS able to pick them up, the odds of her choking are VERY remote.  At most she might  gag, but that's a protective reflex that keeps her from choking.  But nature knows what it's doing. When babies can pick up food, they can eat it.     Most babies are able to self-feed soft foods between 7-9 months. So she's still a bit on the young side, but if she seems interested, try offering some.  Put some bits on her high chair tray and see what she does.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Finger foods are safer and healthier for babies than pureed foods.  Teeth are not necessary.    As to "when" that is determined by the child's own development.  Babies are protected from starting non-breastmilk foods too soon by their inability to eat them.  Most will be able to feed themselves between 6-9 months, some babies with allergies will not feed themselves until 12 months or later.    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279...  Solids best    After six months, Mrs Rapley said babies were capable of taking food into their mouths and chewing it.    Therefore, feeding them pureed food at this time could delay the development of chewing skills.    Instead, she said, they should be given milk and solid pieces of food which they could chew.    Mrs Rapley argued that babies fed pureed food had little control over how much food they ate, thus rendering them vulnerable to constipation, and running a risk that they would react by becoming fussy eaters later in life.    She blamed the food industry for convincing parents that they should give children pureed food.    She said: "Sound scientific research and government advice now agree that there is no longer any window of a baby's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids."     http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...  Won't he choke?    Many parents worry about babies choking. However, there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed. This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have developed the ability to chew. And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things. The ability to pick up very small things develops later still. Thus, a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get small pieces of food into his mouth. Spoon feeding, by contrast, encourages the baby to suck the food straight to the back of his mouth, potentially making choking more likely.    It appears that a baby's general development keeps pace with the development of his ability to manage food in his mouth, and to digest it. A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it. It is important to resist the temptation to 'help' the baby in these circumstances since his own developmental abilities are what ensure that the transition to solid foods takes place at the right pace for him, while keeping the risk of choking to a minimum.    Tipping a baby backwards or lying him down to feed him solid foods is dangerous. A baby who is handling food should always be supported in an upright position. This ensures that food that he is not yet able to swallow, or does not wish to swallow, will fall forward out of his mouth.    Adopting a baby-led approach doesn't mean abandoning all the common sense rules of safety. While it is very unlikely that a young baby would succeed in picking up a peanut, for example, accidents can and will happen on rare occasions  however the baby is fed. The normal rules of safety while eating and playing should there be adhered to when the transition to solid foods is baby-led.
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Go to the doctor and request a blood test, it is uncommon but there are some women who wont test positive on a urine test, my sister was one of them. Good luck.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	dont worry. I would go to the doctor and get a blood test. I took a pregnancy test 2 weeks after my missed period and it said negative, then I took one 2 weeks later and it still said negative. I went to the doctor to make sure everything was alright and he told me I was pregnant. Sometimes your hormones arent strong enough to come up on the home pregnancy tests. Just go to the doc to be sure. Good Luck!!!!|`|THZEgP3waa	some women take a few weeks to show positive.  if you are unable to go to a doctor you should try again in a few days, during the morning preferrably because that is when your hormones will show up the strongest.  im in the same boat here, im a week late with symptoms and showing no positive results.  maybe even try different brands or types of tests because they might have diifferent sensitivities?
jF3XaAwNaa	I been on depo on and off for about 6 years. Its just the depo. It really screws around with your period. I wouldnt worry. You should spot and then stop having a period completly.
9IFF0vIoaa	Tell him honestly.  I would make sure he is alone...and that you don't expect too much from him.  If he seems disappointed or happy, be ready to discuss what the next step will be.  (I assume you will be having the baby, since you are concerned about telling your boyfriend, so I am answering based on that.)    You may want to discuss what steps you will be taking to prepare & what steps he may need/want to be involved in.  What do you both expect from each other as this pregnancy progresses?  What will you both expect when the baby is born?  Will you give the baby his last name even though you are not married?  Are you living apart now?  Will you continue to live apart?  Will he assist you with medical costs?    There is a lot of heavy stuff to deal with...and you both need to be able to be honest with one another.  Judgemental attitudes will only cause stress.  If possible, plan to talk at a time when your other child is visiting friends or relatives for playtime...so that there are no interruptions.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	you could play it off as "i think im pregnant" and he will say " how can you be your on the pill"   just be with him and take another pregnacy test. He will see when it comes out posotive. Or you could take another pregnacy and take it to him and say guess what... im pregnant..  you guys will be great parents jst let him know before its too late.|`|xFt1O80paa	just tell him that ur pregnant and sit down and talk about what ur going to do now. ready or not he made a baby so he has to except it|`|Z8ku3sjLaa	Just tell him the truth, and since he is your boyfriend .. I think he would be happy with the news if he really loved you and cared about you. But when I saw he is still studying.. He is a bit young to have a child. But he needs to know when you have 'fun' in bed there will be some risk to have a child. Getting children is better if your married. Because then most of the men are adult then and they could take care for a family. But there are some sweet boyfriends. So if he is so sweet with you I think he will accept it, even when in the beginning he is a bit shocked. ^^ I hope I've helped a bit.|`|YKvIsrEAaa	I just found I am pregnant also pretty much the same circumstances birth control no condom. my boyfriend is in the military and I am in school not knowing how he would react i panicked and didnt know what to do. I decided instead of freaking out about how he would react i would do it and see for myself. I am sorry to say but you just have to do it.     good luck hope all works out|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Just say honey bad new i am pregnant.What are we going to do you are in school and i am what is your suggestion if he say abortion convince him to let you keep this baby. God must have a reason for this pregnancy.Rem you say you are on the pill?I wish that some good come out of this My prayers are with you.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	the direct approach is the most effective.|`|KHZLPldraa	You:  I have something I need to tell you.  Him: Whats wrong  You: Im Pregnant.  Him:  How did this happen  You: Uhm I didn't make a baby by myself and I'm on the pill.  Him: Guess I should have used a condom.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	Have him over for a nice dinner and tell him you guys need to talk.  Then tell him you took a pregnancy test and it came up positive.  Then explain to him how you feel and ask how he feels.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Well u didnt get pregnant on purpose and it is known that u can get pregnant while on birth control pills. I dont know if maybe u missed a pill or not but it doesnt matter anyway. Ur having a baby. Sit him down and tell him straight. U know am on birthcontrol but it failed and were having a baby. Hes going to be shocked and probably speechless, but  lets see how he takes it after. I thought mined was going to freak and he amazed me he turned around and was super excited. Good luck.|`|cZksfFKFaa	Tell him that its okay to freak out, but your pregnant, and your birth control didn't work. He helped make it so has to be responsible. I just told my hubby ( who was NOT ready ) about a week ago, at first it was like I told him our dog died. He was freaked. But then he realized he's gonna be a daddy, and now he's like floating on cloud 9. Life happens after baby, so its not like you both have to put off your careers. But you may have to move things around a bit. I don't think any guy is truely READY for a baby, but he will be once he starts to picture what it would be like. Just know he might not take it great at first, give him time to absorb it and then talk to him about it.|`|g9ZFjl6paa	just be honest with him. tell him " honey i have something to tell you " when he says " what " just say " you know how im on birth control? well even though i am im pregnant "|`|tu7aqUoxaa	just like that, I'm pregnant|`|hoX7hoINaa	You just tell him. Even though its hard, he needs to know. And birth control can be tricky. I know quite a few who got pregnant while on the pill or another form of it. Either way, the baby is coming, you cant hide it for long.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	No matter what the situation pregnancy is a gift and a blessing. So do something creative to break the seriousness. Wrap up your positive pregnancy test in a box like a gift and put a bow on top. Address it to him and when you leave to go somewhere put it where he can find it. It's a cute way to break the ice.|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	Basically you need to sit him down if u can and explain whats hapened,ur gonna have to do it eventually hun. I know its hard to take in for both of you. Hope everything works out and the very best of luck|`|U5gixzszaa	yeah tell him just make sure he understands|`|OQsj0Am3aa	text him|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	You're just going to have to bite the bullet and out right tell him.|`|rURYaq45aa	this helped me in tellin my boyfriend i was pregnant and it worked :]|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Just tell him and try to work things out. He needs to know anyways so its better early than later. Congratulations    Good Luck!|`|79rfx9gOaa	I've read that the best way to butter them up is to fix (or take them out) for their favorite meal. You guys obviously have to talk about the options you have and what your beliefs are about keeping the baby. Unfortunately, the sooner the better, and it still won't be easy. Just be straight forward with him and let him know all the facts. If you guys decide to keep it, there are ways to work school and kids in together. Good luck!|`|5102dd2c9d2c22f62b8a0e09b82d272daa	"ive got some good news and bad news, good news is, im getting an extra thousand quid a month, bad news Im pregnant."

All the ones i looked at looked pretty much the same so i just chose Asda as they were offering a George voucher.|`|08e69bc01231714035e1395ec889b319aa	I chose Nationwide as I was with them already and I chose a Stakeholders accoaunt.

8aTrJ5yVaa	How about you give them a voucher for a meal to celebrate? Give them an opportunity to spend time together and talk. She will need support and this is a good break for her.     Maybe a spa break/his/her massage if they are into that kind of thing.   Best of luck! x|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	maybe a card and a pregnacy book! TRY CHOCOLATES i know scence ive been pregnant their my weakness!|`|3ymsCAPhaa	Aww wow I wish I had a good friend like you! I loove the idea of getting the mother-to-be (and or/father-to-be) a congratulatory gift! The ideas from the other  answerers are all great! I was thinking maybe some things to pamper the new mama? Early pregnancy sickness and the effects it has on your body leaves you feeling bloated and sort of un-pretty. Maybe some pampering all natural or even organic belly butter for her growing belly? I absolutely loved burt's bee's products through out my pregnancy. I really felt good about putting it on my skin and knowing that nothing harmfull would be absorbed and possibly passed on to baby. I love the idea of a meal voucher at the couple's favorite restaurant as well! That is if she doesn't have the morning sickness bad enough to where she wouldn't be able to enjoy.Congrats to your friend and her husband!|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	you could get her some comfy pj's. I spent almost my whole first trimester asleep lol.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	My friend gave me a gift certificate to get a massage when she found out I was pregnant and that was a fabulous gift! that or something else pampering like a pedicure, or even a gift card to a maternity clothing store would be nice.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Get her a nice card and a "week by week" pregnancy book. It's something she can enjoy and educate herself on how her baby is growing each week.|`|79rfx9gOaa	I would get them a blank photo album or scrapbook kit and tell them to put all the precious memories in it!

OQdPzl15aa	against on scientific and logical grounds.  by the time most women realize they are pregnant, the baby already has fingers.  just googling pictures of abortion and seeing an abortion first hand is enough for me to make up my mind.  people need to be educated on the human life cycle to make better decisions.  I realize how hard unwanted pregnancies are, but abortion isn't the answer to your problems, and many women I have talked to who have had abortions, regretted it later in life because they were mislead into thinking that they were aborting a mass of cells.  FYI-we are all a mass of cells.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	I'm for a pro-choice. No one can say yes or no to this I believe because 1. You don't know the situation and 2. Every women is different.|`|em8A42Bqaa	Its the woman's right to choose.|`|hrz5xj4Daa	i am againest it and here is why.  i have 2 wonderful baby boys but me along with almost all the woman in this section have such a hard time getting pregnant and for someone who can get pregnant so easily get an abortion is completely and totally irresponsible Why would anyone have sex and not want to deal with the consequences that may come from having sex.  it has taken me 2 years to get pregnant again and i would never ever get an abortion because you are aware of the chance of pregnancy and people have been told since elemetary school what can happen so why get pregnant just to abort it it makes no since esp to the woman that want a baby so bad and they cant get pregnant give it up for adoption but please dont abort|`|TrZ2ecnUaa	Against, completely.

It says in the bible that God knew us before we were in the womb which means that even if the circumstances were bad everyone of us were created for a reason. God didn't just create certain people and not others. He created all of equally and besides the baby is the one that has to suffer and the baby is the innocent one that didn't do anything wrong. I think it's selfish to say that its my body and i dont want it ruined. two wrongs don't make a right in God's eyes.|`|29944ccd64861970ae51bf4345a57f13aa	I'm pro-choice, but I could never have one, even if I were raped it would still be my baby right from the start.  I think everyone should have the right to choose, because everyone believes different things.    Having said that I still get really mad when I find out anyone I know is having an abortion, because all I want is a baby, and would take any of those unwanted babies as my own.  Also I think of how hard my miscarriage was, and can't understand how anyone could do that on purpose.|`|IzM84WMXaa	I am pro-choice. No one can determine whether or not you should abort.

jPESbdyyaa	I have a feeling he was always unreliable, even before you got pregnant...it just gets amplified when it's too late to take back your choice to sleep with him.    That being said, yes, you need to tell him how you feel.  Talk to him, and if he doesn't change, you can't keep doing this to yourself -- it'll hurt too much.  I hate to say it, but move on...lean on your family since your man isn't much of a man.  A real man is there for his woman, a real man takes care of his babies.  A real man doesn't go drinking instead of going with you to get your first ultrasound.    He may just be really scared and not ready for this yet.  But the thing is, whether he's ready or not, there will be a baby in 9 months.  Maybe it'll be like that movie 9 Months, and he'll man up one day before it is too late, but you can't chance it.    I know it's scary, but it'll be ok.  Good luck!|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	you could tell him, I dont see how it could hurt, just telling him how you feel. but honestly, i doubt it will help, maybe he'll start going to appointments and stuff but if he didnt want to do it in the first place, he'll only being doing it because you made him feel guilty, not because he wants to be there. you're in a tough situation, i hope he grows up before the baby comes, for the baby's sake|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Of course you should tell him. The best thing you can do is talk to your partner because if you hold everything inside it will drive you crazy. Sometimes guys dont realize how important things are to you, he's probably not trying to hurt your feelings purposely. Just talk to him and let him know how you are feeling.|`|8RyX43hcaa	You have Been a very silly girl, you should not be getting pregnant until you are in a truly stable relationship which you are not. Enjoy your life as a single mum !|`|C4ibOR7Laa	yes, you tell him|`|T1q4GWLkaa	If it's important to you that he participates, you should tell him.  You don't need to harp on it or make him feel guilty for blowing the first appointment, because that will probably backfire.  You can just say something as simple as, "It would really mean a lot to me if you could come to the next appointment.  It's scheduled for this day and time.  If that doesn't work for you, I could change it."  If he's a good guy, knowing how much it means to you will inspire him to support you.  If not, it's better to find out now if he'll be "out of the picture" so to speak.|`|ATyHswTTaa	Hi there dont stress too much need keep ur strenght throught out ur pregnancy.. try speaking to ur man abt ur fears and explain that ur not his ex and ask him to stop treating u like this over her actions, u are not her and u will treat him right and much better and to let u in, let u into his heart and to be here for u in the times u need him while ur carrying his baby.. express urself and dont leave it bottle up as he mite be scared in it too and needs little helping hand to ajust to the idea..     Im single mum and became pregnant at 17yr.. the father was always off partying and didnt care even when my child came along, he just was too immature for been a father.. I was with him for 4yrs, and in the end i know couldnt pretend anymore that everything will work out but i have handsome 7yr old who is doing brill in school, top his class, and when im down i always have a hug and kiss waiting for me to cheer me back up again.. recentally i was ill with the flu and there he was wanting take care of me when should b the other way round, those little things will brighten up ur day also, from smile, kiss and hug to been told ur loved.. im not single tho, i have wonderful man who there for me and my son, who treats him as his own and my son looks upto him also..     yes his father in the picture now, think grow up a bit in last 2-3yrs and sees each other at wkends, which also leaves me have some me time too.. i go to college and on my last year, i will be finished soon and have good career.. there is always silver lining no mather what, so dont think worse of ur future be it going alone or not..|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Tell him.."I'm pregnant and your either in this or not, which is it."|`|qJOOq93zaa	Hii :)    I say that you should tell him how you feel. This will make you feel much better and it will also make him know what's wrong with you. Everything will work out.    Hope that helps :)|`|b57bd1b4c84b281044163759ee164127aa	Congratulations on the baby!     You definitely need to talk to him about it and find out his real feelings.  He may have trust issues because of his ex, but that doesn't mean he should be acting the way he is to you.  Just sit him down and find out how he feels about your relationship and about the baby.  If you don't get it all off your chest then it could get worse as the time goes on.|`|vgkHZSTPaa	Hell yes you definitely need to sit him down and tell him as you're bringing a child into the world and you have to have a very strong relationship to start with. I would definitely talk to him face to face and discuss all your issues before you get further along in your pregnancy as you will need someone there for you and need to know if you can rely on him in the future.  Good Luck|`|b469RgNNaa	im having the same problems with my boyfriend, minus the pregnant part though. my boyfriend was with a girl for 3 years and she cheated on him and was a TOTAL bit/ch towards him but he took it. finally they broke up. now about a year or so later, were dating and he has trust issues with me and doesnt think that ill stick with him. we want to get married but he doesnt think that i will still want to be with him when im of age[im 16 now]. its just a big ordeal that im dealing with. he says hes working on the trust thing, but i really cant see that he is. i dont know how to help other than to tell you to talk to him. and let him know what youre feeling and that you wont do him like his ex did.|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	For your sake and the baby you need to tell him. Ive no doubt you will be a great mother but dont let this misery bring you down. Talking it through might be just what ye both need to do. You as an individual deserves to be happy. I wish you the very best of luck xx|`|gBxp933Daa	I think that you should be care of this guy he doesn't sound trustworthy himself if he won't even make the effort to come for a scan with you... But don't give up on it all and I think perhaps if you do talk to him about this and remind him how lovely you have been to him and you're not his last girlfriend he should apresiate you for the person you are !! It's your first real relationship so I think things could be special.|`|10AvUf8Jaa	Wow It feels like deja vu all over again. I was in the EXACT same situation 4 yrs ago. The best thing I can tell you is if he cares, then you'll have to let him come around himself. At this point, he is probably very nervous, and knows that a baby is a life-long commitment. If he already has trust issues from his past, then he knows that he will have to have a tie to you for the rest of his life, and that probably scares him. Tell him that you understand if he is scared, and that all you can do is reassure him that you will always be there for him and love him unconditionally. Once the baby arrives, he may feel completely bonded with you and forget about his past. Good luck with everything. =o)|`|9p9DDRSnaa	You should definately talk to him about it...Maybe open the conversation by asking him how involved he would like to be with his child...try to show indifference either way to get his truths.  I am sure the conversation will turn to the two of you...that crap about being burned before is just that...crap...anyone who would make you suffer or be punished for someone else needs a reality check.  He will only be holding himself back.  You are right to have the questions.  I would definately let him know that you will not take the brunt of someone else's mistakes...for you and your child.  Congratulations by the way. Man or not, you will never love anything more than you will your child!

Good luck to you....|`|ETthFRBEaa	some people have bleeding but i would just call the doc i dont think its any thing but i am not a doc i think your fine|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Honestly if you do go to the ER their is nothing they can do for u IF you are miscarring they would send you home and let nature do its thing trust me i have been their and i was farther along then you. BUT from the sounds of it it does NOT sound like you are miscarring, your best bet is to RELAX and dont STRESS and let your doctor know at your next visit, or if you see anything else out of the ordinary or blood then call your doctor in the morning. best of luck and im sure your fine congrats|`|TGzOrftPaa	Call your doc.  It's hard to say what it was.  You're past implantation bleeding time.  If you've had sex recently that can sometimes cause you to bleed, but don't worry, as long as it's not alot of blood it's totally normal!  But I'd call just to see what they say.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I'm not sure why everyone else who has answered is freaking out.  You have NOTHING to worry about.  Let's just say that it was blood and not something in your underwear...  YOU ARE FINE!  Many women have some sort of spotting at some point in their first trimester of pregnancy and this is perfectly NORMAL and healthy!  I spotted at about 7 weeks.  Some spot earlier, some spot later.  It's only something to worry about when it is significant blood loss, in which case, you will definitely KNOW that it's blood and not just something from your undies.  So congrats to you!  Your body sounds like it's doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing (or it was just something from your panties).  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|bpqxtkFfaa	Well when you wipped yourself and there was NO blood at all? I think you probably just had something on you're undies. I wouldnt worry unless you start to bleed heavily w/ cramps.    Good luck and congrats!|`|CEfoetMtaa	Call The ER, just to make sure. And if they say come in to the ER to check it out then go! Just to make sure your baby is ok. Call!!!
9IFF0vIoaa	Pregnancy symptoms can vary from person to person.  Some more severe than others.  Spotting is common in pregnancy, and cramping is common especially in the first weeks.  Those two symptoms can also be present for any number of other things, including your period.  If you have had a period, it may be doubtful that you are pregnant...there are false periods during pregnancy...so a test may be your best bet.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	There's a big chance. Take a pregnancy test.|`|Qt4UIC8iaa	usually a healthy couple have a 25% chance of concieving each month. The reason for the cramping and spotting could be due to implantation bleeding which usually occurs during the time frame you are mentioning. The only way to know for sure is to take a test when you miss your period!|`|KcHSMb0Iaa	oh yes. almost definetly. sounds like the spotting you had was at the exact time to be implantation bleeding.  a lot of pregnancy signs wont show up right away, some not at all.|`|f0356b2da1def71b56dea6c821b518d8aa	I hate to sound like the bear of bad news, but there is a chance you could be pregnant..  I've went through the fear of being pregnant before.  And the guy actually ejaculated into me.  But then i got my period and everything was fine, we even had a lot of un-protected sex.    But there is a chance you are pregnant. SO please take a test.. and figure that out.|`|oX4mg0ghaa	Sound prego to me! Probably implantation bleeding. Do a test and update!|`|kogsyGAPaa	if it was around the 12-16th day after your prior period then I say the chances are quite high...other than that though, while it's still possible, I'd say less likely!  Good luck! I know it sucks waiting to take the test!
xzh8r0jIaa	im 37 weeks and if i try to suck in it doesnt go anywhere|`|uuHPneEcaa	don't suck in. Thats not cool.. Ur pregnant. your belly will get bigger. Why would u wanna suck in.  a baby is a blessing. wheather it was planned or not planned.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I'm 19 weeks and just look like I have a beer belly or something at the moment... I just tried it and it was unsuccessful. It was funny, only the top of my tummy would go in lol So, nope|`|rfkVin6Iaa	When the bump gets harder, it will be harder to suck in until you can't anymore.|`|AA11707728	No.  The muscles used to "suck your gut in" are around the navel area.  The baby develops under that.   You can pull your stomach in but your baby will still stick out.    As a matter of fact, as your baby develops, hormones will be released that specifically loosen all the muscles, tendens, joinst etc. in the area, preparing for the day when all that has to open wide so that you can give birth.|`|FlFlyIUwaa	Funny question, but yes, I was able to "suck it in" for a second or too just to see, But now that I am 24 weeks there is no point cause I look pregnant either way! Plus, it hurts, and takes away from babys' room in the uterus...you will look pregnant soon, trust me!|`|rvIrmlTzaa	not really,  wouldn't that hurt the baby though?|`|C4miEeuYaa	It's very possible it's your baby bump but if you can suck it in-then it is probably a little bit of weight. I couldn't suck in when I started showing.|`|TX9igTWraa	it's not possible once you start to get bigger. i think pregnant women can be very cute! with their belly and all. just embrace it!|`|cvdrWBgOaa	No, once it's a real baby bump, you can't suck it in!
1da22694eee1f6055b5ea295d06bcf40aa	It is orange flavored. It taste like flat orange pop.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	I would think that it is artificial flavoring, but ask your dr. to make sure.    I've not had that test yet. I think its coming in 2 weeks, but I have heard that the drink is horrible. I've been told that if you can chill it really cold it is bearable. Also ask your dr. if you can just eat something really sugary instead(maybe some chocolate chip pancakes yum!)|`|AA10747002	No real orange, but I think the lemon lime flavor is better than the orange.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I dont know about acid, but the drink tastes like orange flavored cough syrup w/ sugar...thats not a good example, but its not grss or thick like I thought its just blah!  I dont think its REAL orange just flavored orange...i think|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Orange flavored.  You should be fine.|`|I2jHMLjKaa	It taste like orange koolaide or Hi-C but extra sugary.. It doesnt have any real orange in it its just a flavoring|`|TajdONO7aa	it tastes like that McDonalds orange drink x's 100 i would seriously doubt that has ever met a real orange|`|EUdpSXQWaa	I had to drink the orange one, it's really sweet and doesn't taste like there is anything "real" in it lol Kind of tastes like really cheap orange pop... I think you're safe. If you're really worried about it call your obgyn before you drink it, but I think you're ok. Don't forget I'm pretty sure it needs to be cold when you drink it :)  Good Luck!! :)|`|B1UHqb6Naa	I do not know for sure, I would probably call the Dr. and ask, but it doesn't taste like it has ANYTHING real in it.  It tastes like Sunkist Orange pop with 80 times the sugar in it.    Good luck|`|4AO2myzKaa	You'd have to ask the doc if it had real orange in it, but basically it tasted like an extra sugary orange soda.  It was actually quite good, they gave me one with fizz in it.  =D|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's only orange flavored, it is not made with real citrus.   I wish it were.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	It's just orange flavor.  Not every clinic offers all flavors, either.  Mine only had orange or fruit punch.|`|1CgSVXxXaa	No, it's more similar to orange pop. It doesn't contain any real orange in it. So you should be fine.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	it just tastes orange, no citrus, but you should definitely drink it cold, makes it taste better, easier to drink|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	NO real oranges it is supposed to taste like orange soda but it does not its really nasty, they all are but you have to suck it up and drink.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	it tastes like flat orange soda - not real oranges.|`|YmLIirIqaa	l believe its just orange flavoring. you should call a pharmacist at like a CVS or walgreens and ask to make sure though.|`|8WRnqs08aa	I've had the orange & the cola. Trust me, the orange is much better. Takes like orange crush....    When I had the cola flavor 18 years ago it was flat. The orange that I had last pregnancy (2007-2008) was slightly carbonated.    Take a protein snack with you because you may "crash" after drinking the glucose, with faintness, diarrhea & shakiness as I did last pregnancy.
ZNhP3mpUaa	just crazy. you wouldn't notice or feel anything at 2 weeks. my wife didn't even KNOW she was pregnant until 8 1/2 weeks. good luck.|`|zPGcIbPSaa	Most of the time it will take a bit for symptoms to show so i think your fine. Take a pregnancy test! Thats the best way to know.|`|hoX7hoINaa	At two weeks you wont notice anything out of the ordinary. Take a test when you're able to and go from there.|`|MDGRFBoRaa	Once again, belly hardness is not a sign of pregnancy at this stage.|`|FlFlyIUwaa	Is it possible you may be constipated? I had a great deal of bloating my first few weeks pregnant, I felt really huge! Like I was on my period, but it never came of course...take a urine test the day you miss your period. I had a positive urine test 2 days after I missed my period. Good Luck!|`|yznZqcznaa	Well I am 8 weeks pregnant 104 pounds and mine is not hard yet.  I would think that if this is common in pregnancy that mine would be hard before yours since you are a little overweight.  You are probably bloated.
5yAsj29Vaa	If you don't remember, don't take one.  It's more harmful to overdose than it is to miss 1 days.  Get one of those pill boxes that has the 7 days, and put a pill in each day.  At the end of the week, refill each day; that's how I kept track.|`|Def3uk2aaa	It's probably better to just not take one until tomorrow morning then.  I know there's usually a lot of iron in them, which may be harmful for the baby.  But if you don't take it for one day, the baby will be fine.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	No, taking many would be really hard on your liver and kidneys, but not the pregnancy.|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's not something you want to make a habit of because you can get too much of a good thing, but doing that once won't hurt.|`|eS68lGulaa	U JUST COMPLETELY SCREWED UP THIS WHOLE QUESTION///NOT MAKING SENSE|`|HtHFHfDKaa	No you might get a little nauseated but it shouldn't hurt the baby.|`|MDGRFBoRaa	It depends on the levels of certain vitamins in your prenatals. Vitamin A can be harmful to your fetus if overdosed on. If you're uncertain, do a pill count.|`|I2jHMLjKaa	NO.. Its a vitamin it wont hurt the baby to take 2 in one day just like it wont hurt the baby if you skip a day or two... its not something you have to take religiously everyday you are pregnant they just say it helps they baby...|`|10AvUf8Jaa	I would call either your local pharmacist or your doctor and ask them. I know that high levels of vitamins can cause problems, but sometimes it doesn't do anything. It's better to be safe than sorry. It won't hurt you if you miss one day of taking your vitamins, just make sure you don't make it a habit =o)|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Nope, not dangerous.  It might make you a little sick to the stomach, but thats about it.|`|wVeaFp9Aaa	your doctor or a nurse at your doctors office will be able to tell you, or else a pharmacist, for free over the phone.
O4JuH8zmaa	a hard stomach is not an early sign of pregnancy but if you think you might be then take a test or see your doc.|`|1CgSVXxXaa	Get a pregnancy test, also schedule an appointment with your doctor. It the test come back negative, ask to schedule and ultrasound as well. Sometimes pregnancy test will give you a false negative (even the blood work). It happened with my best friend and she didn't know she was pregnant until she was over 5 months.|`|m0PVHJIvaa	Take a test|`|jPESbdyyaa	At this point, a pregnancy test would give you your answer...it's been more than long enough.  Good luck!|`|9p9DDRSnaa	take a preggers test ASAP|`|AA12123714	Get a pregnancy test or make a doctor's appointment. I think you are pregnant|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Yeah, I would take a pregnancy test to determine what it could possibly be. I wouldnt be pushing on your stomach really hard either - I don't think it will do anything major to the baby if you are pregnant, but that isn't a good idea in the first place.|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	Get a test then you will know for sure. Its better to find out as soon as possible, because if you are pregnant you will need to start prenatal care asap to make sure you and baby are healthy and growing and developing properly.
auUeI2Vnaa	He came in you 7 times?  Well, then there is absolutely no possible way you could be pregnant.  None at all...    Could possibly be too soon to show on the test.|`|iufAPDeWaa	I think it takes 3-4 weeks to get an accurate test. 6 days is way too soon. Lol. You're just anxiou. :)  Be patient and try again in a few weeks. In the mean time keep trying! Chances aren't that slim if you're not ovulating they're just slimmer. I mean because ovulating is the perfect time to conceive. Many people have gotten pregnant when they weren't ovulating. So i say its a possibility but just too early to tell yet. Good Luck!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	consume?    you need to wait until the day your period is due, 6 days after sex,,, waste of money taking a test then|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	If you aren't ovulating, your chances are probably close to 0%    You should ovulate 10-14 days after your period, then start on the 10th and do it every other day until the 17th day. That will ensure you hit the ovulation. However, there is only a 25% chance that you will get pregnant even if there is nothing wrong with either of you. The hormone won't show up until a few days before the next period, sometimes not until you miss it.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	What are the chances I care? 0%  edit:  you do NOT tell me what to do or what to answer, got it and as far as  your problem if your too stupid to know how pregnancy and pregnancy tests work then why don't you post the intimate details of your sex life on the computer for strangers toy read?  Oops you already did that and it is beyond tacky and low.  You have no class.|`|uDZ2sHc0aa	erh, yuk!|`|2ezj28u1aa	did u use a condom?|`|CAAcoqtYaa	Yes. Wait a month or two. If you start throwing up ad feel jumpy and tired then maybe.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	7 times??? Doesn't matter if he comes until it's leaking out your nostrils....if you haven't ovulated or are going to ovulate within 2 days of him filling you up, the chances are slim.|`|OUVUU5xRaa	I know you're super excited, but you have to wait until you actually miss a period.  Six days is not long enough to show up on a test.  Wait until you get closer to your period and test again.  Most tests now will even show positive before your missed period.  Good luck - how exciting!!|`|DUzFgnu4aa	It actually doesn't matter if your ovulating or not. Women ovulate at different times and it isn't always consistent.    Sperm can survive in you for up to 76 hours. So if you ovulate during that time the chances are pretty good that the sperm can reach your egg.    GOod luck (:|`|8V39PymEaa	you have to wait to ovulate so the egg will be ready for the sperm and then give it a try|`|Mb8389POaa	Your closer to being not pregnant then being pregnant. being ttc is stressful don't call it that just call it having fun and doing it a lot!|`|75l2smfCaa	My magic chances calculator says "how the heck would we know what your chances are!!!!!"...sorry...but we dont. You should wait until you actually miss you period before taking a test. Good luck! Baby dust!|`|cU2mZfdNaa	i think you mean conceive and it depends on your fertility. i think a good chance though hun|`|yeh3oVwpaa	Yeah. I think its too soon.   Plus i think the chances are 100% percent.  Good luck :)|`|SEKseW8Caa	You really need to go to the doctors to find out.  But you most likely are not,  good luck trying to conceive|`|KT8SXXXRaa	There are many different tests on the market, some can tell you in as soon as 3 days.  So, you would have to read about the one that you purchased.  When your ovulating is really the best time/chance to get pregnant, so if you wait until that time comes around your chances increase dramatically.  There are also positions you can try that increase chances as well, but him on top is one of the best.  Good luck.|`|cw6kcYayaa	I think you mean you are trying to conceive. 6 days is far too soon to take a test. You'll have to wait until your missed period to know if you're pregnant. Also, try to time your sex with your ovulation times to better increase your chances of becoming pregnant. Good luck.|`|0Zfh77Vpaa	type 'ovulation calendar' into the search engine and it will tell you your fertile times if you put in your last period and refer to it every month till you are preg.  My pos test showed up 9 days after conception.  Good luck and I hope it helps  xx|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	There's always a chance when he doesn't wear a rain coat....  Your best to wait and test when you a week or more late for your period.  Other wise your wasting money on tests.  You won't get a + result until your HCG level is high enough for the test to detect it.    Look at a calender...  Find the first day of your period and count 14 days...  This is when you might ovulate.  Start having sex 2 days before ovulation and the day of and after.
5yAsj29Vaa	Precum contains as much sperm per drop as a regular ejaculation.  Precum is present anytime the penis is stimulated.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, it has sperm in it. You could definitely be pregnant.|`|DutTBV3caa	testing might work. i found out at just under 3 weeks.|`|giRRCXU4aa	Precum is the same thing as the actual thing. It has sperm in it and it can get you pregnant.|`|WgyGipBMaa	Has sperm in it.. I got pregnant with my first like that and I was on the pill and he pulled out..|`|AA11707728	You have almost the same chance of pregnancy from pulling out as from not.    Look....that is simply not an effect method of birth control.  If you just won't use condoms or the pill for some reason, then consider a legitimate natural family planning method involving charting your temperature and cervical mucous.  Done correctly, it's even more effective than the pill.  Several good books on this at Amazon.com  and there are devices that can be amazingly helpful with this:    http://ladycomp-babycomp.com/show.php/in...|`|O4JuH8zmaa	If you're trying not to become pregnant then pulling out is NOT being careful. There is sperm in precum and it is very possible to get pregnant using that "method". There is a very good chance so take a test when/if you're late. Good luck!|`|OFpl236faa	It's how I got pregnant. Yes, it does contain sperm. So it is possible you are pregnant. If you aren't and you don't wish to be, I would use a form of protection.|`|MhoZuvx0aa	hi, if you are due this sat you can buy the test clear blue, this detect 10 days after the sex date, but to save money you should wait, till sun\mon and then you have a 100% result  good luck, use protecton in future if your not wanting a baby, even coming on the body can find its way inside, i know i have a 2 year old to prove it!!!
vGHaYp6Naa	i felt my first movements in the middle, above my baby bump.|`|yB5go5wbaa	low, where your jeans button.|`|puCOYwMmaa	I felt it low, like right above my pelvic bone.  I started feeling it at about 18/19 weeks|`|qHykYLQ6aa	Around 21 weeks I felt him at the top right of the baby bump.|`|rjVALevtaa	Typically, very low. A few inches below your belly button most likely. But it varies for each woman depending on how far along they are when they first feel the baby move. Anywhere from 16-22 weeks is the normal range for feeling the baby's first movement. So, obviously your uterus is much bigger at 22 weeks than at 16...    I guess you'll just have to wait and see! Good luck!|`|TDOfjYGBaa	It depends how far along you are.  I was 13 weeks when i felt him so it was very low but i'd imagine if you didn't feel him/her until the early twentys that it could be a little lower than the belly button
2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	Ovulation usually happens 10-16 days BEFORE your next period begins. It sounds totally backwards and impossible to figure out... but the part of a cycle that usually gets thrown off is the part before you ovulate. So if you usually have a 26 day cycle, you should have ovulated between CD 10 and 16. However, every woman is different and I am not 100% sure what your cycle looks like normally.    You could be pregnant and I urge you to test to find out for sure so you can get adequate treatment early on.    I suggest if you are interested in knowing your cycle better, check out www.fertilityfriend.com. It is full of information on how to track your cycles and there are lots of people there to support you and help you out on this journey. You learn how to use your own body's signs along with ovulation predictor kits and temperatures to pinpoint ovulation.    Best of luck to you!

HclKftzAaa	Do not get an abortion to keep a guy. you will end up resenting him for making you have an abortion and the relationship will not last.    Then you would have no baby and no boyfriend.    You are very young, but that doesn't mean that getting an abortion you don't want won't eat you up inside. If you have any doubts about getting an abortion, don't get one.    And you have said you don't want an abortion. Don't get one. Find some other way to deal with the situation.|`|nKSmgjylaa	Do what you think is best.  It's up to you, if you want to, be Juno and give the baby up for adoption.  It has fingernails!  The guy doesn't understand the emotions you're going through.  Don't let anyone except you influence this decision.  I hope everything works out for you.  Good luck hon!  x|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	hi , my names heather   u dont want an abortion dont get one   and dont worry about ur man for one sec and listen to me     you are not to young   you will not be a burden on society or ne one   you child will inspire u forever and may even save ur life and make u a better happier nicer person     mine did     i was 14 when i got preganat   15 when i had him   i new from the moment i found out that i ws keeping my bby and that i already loved my baby because it was my baby   he gave me something to live for   something to strive for   something to make me a better person     i think teen moms have a ton of courage and heart    babies are a blessing no matter how they came about   so dont abort ur gift   being a mom will make u feel so wonderful and like u have a purpouse     its hard   but not really   u can be a great teen mom   if u try hard enough and u really want to be     email me   if u need more advice or need to talk     crazzibitty12@yahoo.com    heres my myspace to uf u have one|`|xOvPuyfHaa	Talk to him, I'm 15 and I'm 14 weeks pregnant and my boyfriend (when he first fount out) wanted to get an abortion, but I simply wouldn't accept it, after a long, hard discussion, we decided to keep this baby as our own. It's just as much your baby as it is his, so you really need to let him know what you want|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	if you dont want abortion then dont  you always have adoption as an option, or even end up keeping the baby|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Ask yourself who is more important your child who will always be there or a boy who can be easily replaced. If he's pressuring you so into an abortion exactly how much love does he have for you.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Um according to you last question you should be around 5-6 months pregnant kind of late to get an abortion.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	if you dont want to, you dont have too, but your boyfriend sounds smarter than you do.|`|Zf18VjlCaa	He will leave you. You are 15. Don't throw away your life. Get an abortion and STOP HAVING SEX.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	you should get an abortion. even if your boyfriend didn't want you to its the best option your not old enough to deal with a pregnancy or actually having a baby. don't listen to all those pro life people that would rather she you suffer through a pregnancy then have a baby be killed that's not even a baby but a blob of cells. abortion is the best option in your case.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	not telling you what to do but i was pregnant when i was 15 (im 26) and i now have children of my own. i had an abortion when i was 15 and i don't regret it . think of what you want for your kids, don't you want to be able to spoil them sometimes. don't you want them to be able to be proud of their mom? don't be a statistic, think of what you can or cant offer your child. see what type of support you will have, babies grow up. do you think you will be able to do it alone, because you have to face fact and worst case scenarios. make an intelligent decision. and please be more careful from now on. coming from someone who was in the same boat i know how ward it is. but think of what your life will be and really know what you're getting yourself into.     keep your chin up|`|fIjB97qqaa	This is such a sad situation. The moron had sex with you and then doesn't want to deal with the consequences.    You made a terrible decision, and you either have to murder your unborn child and continue to date your little high school boyfriend who will eventually dump you and OBVIOUSLY doesn't love you, or, you have the child, adopt it away to more able parents who cannot have children for various reasons and will be happy to be able to care for a child, or, you have the child, live in poverty for the rest of your life and the child suffers.    Welcome to a world of nightmares.    Oh, since this guy sounds like a Class A Jackass, he's probably had sex with other girls, too. Get some STD tests.    Good luck.|`|eS68lGulaa	boys come and go.....ure child is foreveer just remember that.....dont let a guy influence ure decision like that...its ure body stand up for ureself|`|AmqQ9it5aa	There are lots of people out there who want to give love to a baby.|`|GwQoeHK4aa	Only you know what will be best for you in the long run.  Ultimately this should be your decision: not your boyfriend, or your friends, or random people on yahoo answers, or your parents.  You are a strong young woman and you will survive this situation.      That being said, don't try to make this decision alone.  Find adults you trust and ask them for help.  This could be anyone you trust: a parent or teacher or pastor or counselor or neighbor or a friend's parent.  They have life experiences which can help you (you could be surprised by who had an abortion or had a child as a teenager).   If you are too nervous to do this at first call a crisis line which will give you all of your possible options.  Additionally they can help you practice what you will say to your parents or other adults in your life so that talking to them is less frightening.  This website http://www.thehelpline.org/ has useful info on unplanned pregnancies and it's crisis line is 1-866-942-6466.  People will help you.    People on here are going to give you their moral opinion on what is 'right' and 'wrong'.  People in your own life will as well including your boyfriend.  Try not to be overwhelmed or pressured by ANYONE.  You will be unhappy if you go against your own morality whatever it is.  Regardless of what you decide your boyfriend might leave you... and that sucks it really, really does.  I can tell from the way you wrote your question how much he means to you.  But this is your body and your life and ultimately the only opinion that matters is yours.  The people in your life who truly love you will love you and be there for you regardless of what you choose.      Right now you are in a stressful and potentially overwhelming situation and it will be tempting to spend every moment worrying about what will happen, what choices you should make, or what other people in your life are thinking.  In the midst of all of this make sure to take care of yourself.  Get as much sleep as you can.  Exercise will help keep your mood up.  If you are feeling stressed out do things that will help you relax like reading a book you enjoy, listening to music, drinking a warm cup of tea, doing a hobby you enjoy (like drawing, playing an instrument, or baking), or watching a favorite movie.  You will need to make a number of decisions very soon but you will be more confident in them if you are well rested and calm.    I believe in you to make good choices about what is right for you.  Be strong and everything will work out.  Good luck.|`|cgmBEvHIaa	ur way too young.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	It's up to you.  Don't get an abortion if it's only to stay with him  Do what's right for you and the baby.    If that means you might lose him, then he's not worth it!|`|mFZGIPcWaa	He keeps telling you because he knows that having a baby is a big responsibility and he's not ready for one, but he also should have used protection if pregnancy was a possibility. He says he won't leave you now, but teenage statics in pregnancy, boyfriends that young 89% leave either just before the baby is born or when the baby is born. He is being very selfish right now though, it is your body, you know what is right.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	you dont have to if you dont want to ... but hes smart. It would be better to. Even though some people are against it, it will ruin your life. and you can only get it done before you are 3 months pregnant.|`|A8ht05FXaa	it more important youre life than a relationship, dont be saced if he really love you as he says they wont make anything to the baby como on its a life!! do you want to kill someone?|`|X0xHXDcTaa	This isn't his decision! That life is growing in you. If he can't deal with the consequences than he isn't worth you. You are right by not wanting too. If you can't raise the baby than consider adoption. He isn't the one that has to go through the physical and mental pain of an abortion. Think long and hard before making such a life altering decision! It can haunt you!    Someone said don't you want to be able to spoil your children sometime?? What does that mean? I would rather have very little with a lot of love for my God given children, then know that I killed one so that I would spoil others in the future!!! And they also said don't you want them to be proud of their mom. I wouldn't be proud of my mom if I knew she had killed my unborn sibling!  I pray you make the right decision!|`|29WFvvNPaa	Please don't abort.  You'll regret it for the rest of your life.  There are plenty of people who cant have children that would love the opportunity to have one.  You even get to pick the parents and whether or not to be in the child's life.  You have all the perks of being in their life and have the chance to have one of your own.  Killing a baby does not solve the problem.  And sweetie, NEVER listen to the father.  They are not the one having the child, you are.  It is your choice, not his.  Please give that child a chance.  What would have happened if your mother aborted you?|`|BCmyTUSlaa	That decision is yours and only yours. Abortion is a womans right and if you feel that's what's best for you, then that's what you choose. Consider all your options, abortion, adoption and keeping the child.. Again it's your choice. Talk with your parents and close friends, you need all the support you can get! If your boyfriend loves you, he will stand by you with whatever decision you make. Goodluck|`|kzucChnaaa	If you dont want one, dont get one. I'm 14 and 8 months pregnant. I wanted to get an abortion cause I didnt want to go through the pregnancy, and then all the hassle, and I didnt think I could give my flesh and blood up for adoption. I chose not to get it, because I knew the guilt I would face constantly.    You know what, my fiancee was here for me the whole time so I dont know what you're going through 100% but I do know the stress you're facing. But I have my family supporting me since I decided to keep the baby, and you know what, I cant wait to have her here. Im glad I decided not to ruin her life before it even started. Make the choice you want, not his whether you will lose him or not!|`|MO2H26XOaa	Hun It is 100% your choice. He may have say in it, but if you do not feel comfortable harming an innocent child, then do not do it. I am an 18 year old mother, pregnant at 17. I still go to school (senior), and it is not that bad. There are hard times, but even with people planning on having kids have it rough at times. I did kind of regret having a kid so young, but she is now 6 weeks old, and I wouldn't change it for the world. Just try it out, and if things do not get better for you, there is always adoption. Anything is better than an abortion. Just think about it. Look up abortion and how they do it. It's not very pretty...|`|UD1ki1I1aa	well your screwed.|`|pHIUUnOiaa	1. you made a horrible decision it was very immature and selfish   2. and i think that if you get an abortion is even worse also i this guy was really the love of your life he wouldn't be telling you to MURDER the baby  3. there are other fish in the sea hes not the man for you      DONT HAVE AN ABORTION JUST THINK YOU ARE A MURDER IF YOU DO! :(|`|j73bqzRAaa	if he really loved you  and knew how you felt he wouldnt make u choose between ur unborn baby and him  i dont belive in abortions at all i think  that if ur baby has a heart beat its alive  if your heart is telling you not to then dont   that baby  is going to be a blessing weather its for you or someone else meaning adoption  but then again i could never carry a baby in my tummy 4 9 months then give it up   but  your young and its a really big resposabilty do  what your heart says not your head|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Hi, have the baby...if you go by his decision you will regret it.serious..all my friends have...here is my story..im me if you have any questions. :) Click on the link below..    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtjjVbhtB...
3wq8n2BFaa	That's so weird! I have had the same exact thing.  I also thought it might be implantation pains, but it seems strange that it would be right around the belly button.  mine last about 5 days and has generally stopped.

OaJpFUTVaa	Girl love who you are. You're a pleasant weight. I used to be over weight but I called my self pleasantly plump. And as for boyfriends, wait, there is no sense in breaking your heart early. For sixteen years of my life I was single and I saw my friends left and right getting their hearts broken. I was the strong single one, use you singleness as a way to inspire those who have hade failing relationships or had their hearts broken and show them that a girl can be independent and single and be happy.   Every morning I look in the mirror and think beautiful. Also take a few smiles into the mirror, a smile I find that a smile always makes your outfit look better.  My favorite song from Hair Spray is Big Blonde and Beautiful,  my favorite part is where Queen Latifa sings "WHO WANTS A TWIG WHEN YOU CAN CLIMB THE WHOLE TREE"   I love that part you should listen to that song it gives me a boost of confidence every time I hear it.  I waited for sixteen years and finally I met a guy it didn't work but the second one I met we're a match. All it takes is time. Love your body believe you're beautiful, and I found if you compliment your friends it builds up my confidence and positive attitude.|`|NEbt7r1Saa	okay girl we all think that. Its callled hormones acting up.I cry for no reason. It will be okay. You just need to think positive. You need to not listen to the negative things people say, They wont say themm unless you show emmotion because they know it bothers you.  |`|0770fd55f95f18aa245026f830c7ded7aa	I wish I could help you but every once in a while I feel that way too lol but i have plenty of other issues too. Well Im leaving it at that, how about treating yourself to a spa someday or maybe a makeover, do something you like or that is empowering to you. I hope you over come this and be the best person you can be. Good luck and my best wishes goes to you.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Instead of picking out bad things about yourself and try to pick out the positive things that you like. Also--I know it's hard--try not to care what other people think or listen to what they say. If your worried about your body, get it shape. If you aren't overweight or anything like that, I think you should just try to pick figure flattering clothes so you look good. :D hope this helps. good luck|`|g1155MhXaa	Step 1: look in the mirror and write down all your imperfections.  Step 2: Then Try to think of every thing that you are good at, how smart you are..ect.  ( try to think of more positives than negatives)  Step 3: Remember everyone who loves you and how they think of you.    Remember there is someone who cares about you and thinks you are beautiful!  Ps.Who needs a boyfriend to tell them you look good when you gots tons of other people,right?|`|EkXQVZU5aa	CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR AWESOME.|`|vVd4pw35aa	Listen,having self esteem means feeling good with your own self,wich also means that you have to accept yourself the way it is!!!I know you don't fully understand what I mean but let's put it this way:    Try to do this,when you walk don't try to think what others think of you and say 'I know I'm better than them' If someone bugs you don't pay attention-it's positive that he/she doesn't have a life and tries to make others feel bad coz he can't be better than them.    Remember:EVERYONE has insecurities no matter what you think becoz they look like cool...    this works for me:Walk and when you feel like someone's looking down to you say "I rock,I rule I know I better that him/her' if this works then I'm sure you won't have to dress better or look prettier in order to have self esteem|`|uV2ql06Oaa	ugggh I know this isn't helpful...but I feel like the exact same way... d: sometimes I can get myself to feel pretty confident at home, but then when I get to school I'm not confident at all... it's awful!|`|mgOj6Uucaa	I have had times when i look in the mirror i think im pretty/ugly, so what you should is suround yourself with ppl that care about you no matter what. and a VERY important thing, always dress/do ur hair however it makes you feel happy, not impress anybody. [listen to music, sing and dance 2 ur fav songs]|`|ei281SLRaa	SAME HERE! age and all! I know exactly how you feel, i just think positive everyday. i also havnt had a boyfriend. i say, dont get one until you are sisteen because your not going to get married to them, and i will just cause you more stress. just calm down, and tell yourself that you are pretty and wait. i know you can make it without a boyfriend if you dont want one, right now, you dont need a guy in your life even though a lot of people say that. just hang tight. thats what im doin. teenage years SUCK! everyone knows that.|`|kdxxuQwNaa	I'm in the 10th grade and I don't have a girl friend and I know a lot of other guys who haven't either so don't feel bad, a lot of guys have low confidence.     Anyway, about you. Hold your head up high, make sure you are zit free, and I really don't know what else. But remember, us guys can be just as nervous.|`|NCEN1nOXaa	Im 14 and kinda wonder if im really pretty or not too. and i havent really had a boyfriend, but i dont like dating.   And im only 100 pounds and my doctor told me im overweight. Im only 4'11. But if you arent fat, like health problem fat. you probably arent. im not.  I told my friend that im squishy, cuz im not super skinny, and  he wants to poke me and stuff cuz he thinks its funny. so i get my   fun out of saying im squishy!|`|qLHRkixHaa	like audrey hepburn said, happy girls are the prettiest girls :]  i am 14 and have low self confidence too, but if you think nicely about yourself, it makes other people think good things about you.   i used to not believe that, but on days when i though i looked good, i noticed that other people though i looked good and on days when i thought i looked bad, well, people didn't say much about my appearence haha. confidence is a tricky thing, but just think, in 10 years it won't matter if we looked good every day in highschool.     hope i helped at least a little bit.
UgIOVl1jaa	I was curious when I read your question about my nuchal thickness & I'm reading the report now, it was 1.85mm & I was given a very, very low risk rating of 1:14417 for Trisomy21 & 1:27123 for Trisomy 13/18 so based on what you've provided I wouldn't worry at all!|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	Dont panic just yet!  the nuchal trans does refer to certain abnormalities such as downs but it not always 100%  accurate.  Wait until the specialist does it over and it should have been at wk 12 as that is most accurate.  A week off can be a big difference in a test like that.. i hope that eases your mind...|`|WD6OUUDZaa	don't worry! i am 38 and got a NT fold of 3.0mm. the doctor came in and hugged me and said he was SO sorry!  i was so scared! we had to go back for a blood test, which will tell you more. the fold measurement gave us a 1 in 25 chance of a Downs baby. well, my WONDERFUL husband said it was a non-issue either way and the baby was a blessing Downs or not and we opted not to do amnio. so a week later we got the blood results and we are now 1 in 425! good luck, and don't worry yet!
6mhFHSRSaa	It could be. Pregnancy increases blood flow in your body, which may make your nose more sensitive and prone to bleed. Depending on where you live, if you are running a heater, you probably have especially dry air, which will also contribute to the problem.    I am somewhat prone to nosebleeds anyway, and I had several in early pregnancy with my first pregnancy. This time around, I have not had as many. I try to keep myself well hydrated and I sleep with a humidifier and a vaporizer in my bedroom to try to keep the air moist. Those things really help me.    Best of Luck!|`|qUTmN23Raa	well...  being one week late... yes. big sign.  and my nose bleeds lol. ive heard tht its normal in pregnancy.|`|hG8tLBSMaa	well try taking an hpt... i took one 3 days after my missed period and it was a BFP :)
K5TrkUhCaa	No, it won't make your baby drop. When your baby drops you will be able to breathe better maybe if you were having a hard time catching your breathe before and you will feel more pressure in your lower abdomen or on your cervix. Your hips may hurt or feel more sore also. Some women never notice any of this though so it's not a definite way to determine if your baby has dropped yet. Congrats to you and good luck!|`|KqloS80maa	no ur baby drops when shes ready ...sometimes she may have dropped already and u may not have noticed ...i never felt myself supposedly drop with my daughter|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	LOL one way to help induce labour is a bumpy car ride so yes your baby could have dropped ;)|`|AA11815208	Im 37 weeks and my baby dropped last week. You will feel the pressure on your cervix. You will know when it drops. Plus sometimes my tailbone has pressure and my hips at night. So you will know!|`|8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	lol|`|HcMvtMT7aa	Well, your baby was probably on His/her way to drop anyways and the bumpy car ride helped gravity a little.

f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	What you are describing is what happens to men who have had sexual experiences at a very early age with grown women.   People claim that  young boys are not going to be affected by being with a woman.   They are.   They grow up to be jerks.    A mother can keep better track of her kids and who they associate with.   Teach them values.   These "players" had issues with women long before they were grown.   It's like deep down they hate women but they will never admit it.|`|IcnilUuUaa	A woman can teach a son a whole lot, but it is ultimately up to the individual as to what and how they are going to live their lives.|`|HbaxtX44aa	one who has made mistakes,by being treated as such without realizing until it was too late,like when the kids are 7 and 8.  everyone makes mistakes,even dads....and yes moms too.  shoulda,woulda,coulda and all that....comes with age and life,and its a hard lesson learned,but you will get the lesson one way or another.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	All the men that I've known that didn't seem to have alot of respect for women, all had issues with either their mothers or their sisters.  I think alot will depend on how much respect they have for their mothers, just like fathers affect daughters relationships with men. It also depends on the type of relationships they witness as young children, if their father is abusive for example, they may end up repeating that same behaviour, so if the father cheats all the time, they may see that as acceptable.  These don't account for 100% of the cases of course, but I do believe there is a strong connection.|`|tt6SzpTFaa	A woman who wasn't ready to have kids.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	a woman who probably didn't have a husband around to teach her son how to be a REAL man.      MEN and FATHERS are important, but go ahead and blame the Mom.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	a mother who has no respect for herself, a mother who is too busy to instill values in her son, or a mother who raises a child alone and has no positive male role model for her son.|`|J7GTIE5raa	hessed is right
r0ISrLc1aa	waiiiit. i dont know what you mean. if you want to make yourself LOOK sick, like to get out of school, this is what you do. go to bed early and be like uhh i dont feel well, im just gonna go to sleep. make SURE your mom knows youre going to bed early.  then, at like 3 in the morning, go to your moms room and be like wahhh i just threw up. & most likely she'll be too tired to even get up, so she'll just be like just try to go back to sleep. and then in the morning just act like your stomach hurts, you don't need to fake throwing up again say it was like bad food or something, you don't know. but since you 'threw up' you can't go to school, your stomach is still bothering you. ;)    umm if you want to actually be sick...look that up on the internet, i'd feel bad if i told you and then you died. :(|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Not a good idea, unless you're looking to be fitted for dentures early.

Get some lotion that would make you look pale, or heat yourself up. Heavy coats, sweatshirts, blankets, etc. When your mom takes your temp., ask her to go get some Gatorade or O.J. (or water), and then stick in your sweatshirt or stomach heater pad up to your ear and make sure it's on the temp. thing. When she comes back, show her you have a fever. (Make sure it's not super low or high!)  Pretend to have a headache, but refuse to take any pills. (if that's possible....)  Tell her you have a sore throat, and cough a lot....lots of sniffles and sneezes. :) (fake sneeze)  Hope I helped....  and please don't get yourself sick for REAL|`|tt6SzpTFaa	If you're talking about making yourself sick like puking everything you just ate, then I won't help you.|`|xOvPuyfHaa	why would you want to do that?

kPl8TTzNaa	Horrible. Why not use a pretty, feminine name like Isla, if you are looking for an island type name?      Isla (EYE la) - Scottish Island  Eydis (I dees) - Isle goddess; Goddess of the Island|`|f3n2zXG2aa	u g l y name|`|CxRJwJsraa	My roommate in college was named Melissa Lyle. I wasn't used to Lyle on a girl, but she told me it was French and meant island.    I think it CAN work. But I think it woks best as a middle name.|`|DP48dIxhaa	Yes it's a unisex name. & it means from the island.|`|lSvcX175aa	i like it but ya my grandpas name was Lyle but ya I like it as a girls 2! it wuld b so cute!|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I really like the name Lyle, but just for a boy. It means "the island" and is French and was orginally a surname.
uV2ql06Oaa	who knew golf carts could be so dangerous! btw, love your name ;)|`|sKmQVwQMaa	pay for it.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	That happened to me once. No joke.  My friend was going 30 in her golf cart and swerved. We flipped over and I was on crutches for a week. I still have massive scars.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Yes, you should. It depends on the model, and you're not old enough to drive without an adult.    Bandit: That's a girl.|`|S2FhDtfSaa	You broke it, you pay for it. Man up !|`|EkXQVZU5aa	Why is this a question? are you not sure who got run over?     P.S. Yes, yes she did
6ndM8fNLaa	I'm not a doctor, but I don't think she will get pregnant. However, if this freaks you out, I suggest reconsidering unprotected sex.|`|HcMvtMT7aa	Pretty unlikely.  But remember, a woman can get pregnant at any time and can get pregnant on her period because sperm can live in a woman for 72 hours until her next egg drops ready for ovulation.  Try wrapping that sucker up next time so you won't find yourself on here again asking people to try not to scare the dog **** out of you.  Also, how would you know there was no "cumm" on your penis?  Does your "cumm" solidify and not wipe off in her vagina?!  Good luck!|`|HZbSbZIraa	the chance is very very unlikely but it only take one sperm :) but the best chance of her getting preg is when she is ovulating which is more than two days after her period soem advice though next time no matter how LONG you plan on doing it wrap it up ;)

HclKftzAaa	it sounds like you have a 4 week cycle. have sex 14 days after the first day of your last period (ie. 14 days after the 28th Jan). This is about when you should ovulate.    having sex from cycle days 12-16 (9th-13th feb) just to be sure would be better.    It took me two years to get pregnant, so i don't even know what you're whinging about...|`|eS68lGulaa	keep trying 2 months isnt too long....|`|aaVod31Gaa	it took me 8 months with baby   1 and 7 months with baby   2 and we had been using ovulation test kits the entire time!!! it takes healthy couples until age 35 at least a year|`|HAueVh8Naa	2 months is not a long time ive been trying for 8months now .you ovulate 14 days after your period starts but its differnt for every one i read its best to have intercourse every 36 hours  . you can go on fertilitygal.com for monthly charting|`|5pGfmlxcaa	trust me when i say this   u still have aot of time    u aint the only one on here with the same problem   wait a year befor u go to the doctors if u dont get pregnant within a year they will oput u on some kind of fertility pill to help !!!    here some tips u can do in that time  1.when u have intercourse make sure u dont get up lay thier for atleast 10 minutes befor getting up or useing the bathroom   2. try and avoid heat like really hot showers   3.have sex every other day      hope i helped   ??baby dust to you??
Ew2wC9piaa	we have one made by nuby and he just loves it here is a link to what we have  http://nuby.com/products/cups/9647.aspx    he uses the gerber nuk bottles that have silicone nipples  we tried the nuk cup but it had a latex nipple and he did not care for it, than we tried one that had a hard spout with no luck  i found this one and he just loves it  best of luck|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I had to teach my daughter to suck on the sippy cup in order to get the contents.  I did this by putting a small amount of fruit puree on the spout so that she would suck on it, and once she got a mouth full of liquid, she was drinking from them like a pro.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	my son like the ones made by gerber, they r a little softer on the spout. but if she just starting 2 use it she may not care for any @ first, but in time she will just keep offering it 2 her! best 2 ya!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	The Nuby two-handled sippy cup is the only one my son Max would use.

c6cd26c5768fb4905d753985f39626fdaa	no, more people should be like you, happy where they are at the moment|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	Hell, my husband and I have been together for 10 years and married for 5 on valentines day this year (it is our anniversary).  My husband works second shift, so he will not even be home to even have dinner with, and I will be in bed by the time he gets home that night because I work part time on Saturday mornings.    You are doing more than we will be doing by going to the aquarium!  At least you are actually doing something that day :)|`|5D0KuT74aa	valentines day is the second most pointless holiday, the first is st patricks  who really cares about this stuff?  its just a lame holiday|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Just ignore the "poor you" comments. There is no reason why you and your children can't enjoy your very own special valentine's day. "Keep Busy", honestly. Bella is a very lucky little girl, enjoy your time spent with her.|`|9JHf7vsQaa	Look, personally I think Valentiens day is over-rated. I think you should celebrate how strong you are inside. It takes a lot to raise a kid alone, and you must be doing such a good job. Don't feel sad at all, I'll be single, and I'm totally fine with that. Just look at it like the sky is the limit, and you have no one holding you back. When people ask you what your doing, be proud you'll be taking your daughter to the aquarium, because in 20 years looking back, you'll probably be happier you were with her rather than a guy.    From another single lady,  Anonymous.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	mhm........  Well I mean I am single it doesn't bother me! I am only 15!|`|uOp2sdiQaa	i'm 31weeks pregnant with twins girls, and i would much rather be able to spend valentines days with my children than any guy=]    i think its awesome your having a nice day with you daughter! i cant wait to do those things!|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I'd rather be single than in a relationship and miserable. I mean sure I get lonely sometimes but a lot of people do love me; my family, friends, God, and my pets. I do not need a boyfriend or a husband or any male to make me feel wanted and loved. I already feel enough love as it is =]. And your child loves you SO much, more than any man ever could; look at it that way. She looks up to you and respects you and thinks you are the coolest person on the planet and she's lucky to have a mom like you. =]|`|jfwmelYgaa	I'm single and celebrating with my daughter.|`|lAjnRFSVaa	Don't worry everything will be fine u will find someone.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I don't think what your doing is bad at all. Sounds like a lovely day. I don't have kids or a significant other (or interested in having one) but I'm still going to enjoy the day and not be sad about it.     I'm going urban exploring with my friends (singles and 2 married couples who just think the holiday is ridiculous). No strange reactions. The year I went to the shooting range to learn how to fire a gun on valentines day I did get some odd reactions. But it was fun!|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Real big deal is if you had no child, if your child had died like mine did.  Then it would be a sad valentine, tell the people that think you should be sad to shut up.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I've never quite understood that holiday.  It never made any real sense to me.  It seemed made up to me.  I'm married and I've never really cared about that holiday.  It all seems silly.  Maybe I'm cynical, maybe I'm a realest but I think the whole thing is goofy.   Enjoy the Aquarium that actually sounds like fun.  I want to go to the one near us.  i think my kids would absolutely love it.  Their favorite is when we go to Petsmart and look at all the animals.  They could spend hours just looking at the fish or the cats or the birds.|`|AA10481071	I'm lonely|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Good for you! Being alone is FAR superior to being in a bad relationship, which many people settle for. I think you should be thrilled to feel so comfortable with who you are! I am  married, and this year my husband and I are both looking forward to celebrating it with our daughter who is sooooo excited about "walentines" & making heart shaped cookies. Have a great Valentine's day with your daughter.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Your daughter is your Valentine it doesnt have to be no man! Have fun!|`|IcnilUuUaa	I look at holidays as another thing the government has set in place for us to spend money. I am not single, but I still feel that you should spend your days how you feel, and the love you get from your children is true love which does make you feel warm inside.  Don't listen to people who talk down to you or try to make you feel bad. Whats better... being with someone on that day who doesn't recognize your true beauty, or being with your children who give you unconditional love.
RAgWVuu4aa	I don't know...It also annoys me...What she does with her life in none of my business, and what seems like the right choice for one person might not be the right one for another...    I will give people facts, but I'll never tell them not to (for this kind of situation, anyway).      A lot of the time the people who answer like that think they're being mature and smart...It's not smart to judge people you don't know...Besides, she'd do it anyway...Being told by a few people on the internet not to probably won't change her mind...Or anyone else's...      People should still be able to give their opinions, but maybe they should think it through more...?|`|r39EDGhPaa	I don't feel the same.    If you don't want to be told not to have sex and whatnot, then you shouldn't say your age at all.|`|KbPrPuvhaa	i soo agree w/ answer number 1 :]|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Yeah it bothers me when they comment on everything but the question.  I'm guilty of doing it though.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	agreed with first answerer.|`|HclKftzAaa	i agree that if you click 'answer' then you should answer the question posed.    However, i don't see the harm in also posting your opinion on the matter(s)- IF it's done in a respectful way.|`|ejJD6BBXaa	y do kids wana have sex so young >? im 18 and wished i didnt do it so young.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	If you post something on here your going to get what people really think or want to say. If they fell like pissing you off then they will, if they want to help then they will. It's just something that always going to happen on here so its no use bitching about it|`|uV2ql06Oaa	I agree with you. it's like people can make their own decisions and mistakes so give the poor person have an answer!|`|7qVv4Qi4aa	DEFFINATELY. i hate how somebody always asks for help, but people just give opinions. it's really annoying. it's like helloooo nobody cares what you think just help the child please! lol
0cc5b5bbc5737c639788c13b8ae7e80daa	I did the castrol oil from walgreens not the car shop... Its like a cooking oil............ The first time I tried i was three weeks till my due date, i took a teaspoon full mixed in with OJ omg it was nasty and it gave me the shits thats it...( i think it is because the baby wasnt ready ) Then i took it one last time a week before i was due and i almost puked and i couldnt keep drinking my cup of juice with the teaspoon of castrol oil. YUCK, but within 30 minutes of drinking what I did get in, I was sitting at the computer and i heard my water bag break, i was soooo happy... The problem with the castrol oil is that i was scared i was going to have the shits all over the dr while i was squeezing so i had to warn the doc with what i have done :) Which i didnt get the shits thank god! But my favorite part of the whole experience is that from the time of my water breaking and my son being out it was a total of an hour and a half... He just like slipped out. The doctor told me my labor was so quick and easy because the castrol oil is like lube .... But in the end i had a healthy baby boy with NO pain meds only cause i didnt have time to get them :O)|`|HcMvtMT7aa	having my water broke by my obgyn with a needle.|`|GrpYjwH8aa	I tried EVERYTHING that you hear about, but I didn't go into labor until 8 days after my due date. And even then it wasn't progressing so I had to have pitocen.|`|iGiLPpEXaa	I tried walking but i dont think it helped, she came when she was ready!!!!|`|bO1gUExAaa	With my first pregnancy I did the castor oil thing, ( I will never do it again, it's not worth the toilet time) it started contractions which they stopped for me via a shot ( I was a week off of my due date).  Tried sex with both of my previous pregnancies, nothing, both of mine were overdue.|`|Jswomud7aa	I went to the mall with my mom and walked for like 3 hours, shopping. It was fun. Then in the late afternoon we got pedicures which included reflexology, and after that I had a facial and massage.    I really think that all the walking then total relaxation afterward induced my labor and I had really cute piggies to show off the the nurses in the hospital! LOL|`|yB5go5wbaa	I've been trying sex, walking, bouncing on my birth ball, drinking raspberry tea, and eating spicy food.  Nothing's worked so far!  Walking is the only thing that worked sort of, I started having contractions that were about 7 minutes apart consistently, but as soon as I laid down to get some rest, they slowed down :(  haha, good luck :)|`|VClxXNs3aa	pitocin iv drip.|`|hoXv1ilsaa	Fresh Pineapple|`|KqloS80maa	my water broke on my due date at 4am ha lol ..but i walked this **** out myself ....then i took a long hot bath at around midnight then 4 hours later whatdo u kno
SP9toeU4aa	I usually don't like to argue abortion, but when the baby is so far along, that they have to do a partial birth abortion... it is morally wrong. The baby is viable by then. Thank God that they have been banned in most places, though a few states will still do them electively.     There is no justifiable reason to perform this procedure. End of story      To the guy above me:   You are correct that, "partial birth abortion" isn't a medical term. The procedure, however, is very real. The baby is delivered in a breech position, leaving the head inside while suctioning out the brain matter. These are the facts, it is not just a fear tactic.    And to the girl below me, A baby has a chance of living after 22 weeks of life with the medical technologies we have today. (roughly 4 months along). Abortions can be performed at this stage in pregnancy. SO.... how about YOU get YOUR facts straight!|`|q4EXFhV7aa	You don't 'get' it because it isn't an actual medical term, just a fear tactic. NO partial births happen in this country. It is against the law and has been for years. If someone is making a claim about this procedure, they are trying to elicit fear--fear that our nation would actually condone partially aborting a viablie fetus. That is false.  "The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the term "partial-birth abortion" in the act pertains to a procedure that is medically called intact dilation and extraction. Under this law, "Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both." The law was enacted in 2003, and in 2007 its constitutionality was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart."  Planned Parenthood does NOT perform 'partial birth abortions'. That is a complete fabrication. Further, NO ONE has introduced ANY legislation to request that this law be overturned.|`|yB5go5wbaa	It's not like babies are being aborted at 9 months.  Do some research.  Look up how far along you can abort a fetus in all states.  Don't judge.  Thanks.|`|AOfm8ey6aa	I agree with you, but what is your question? Why they bother? Because they do not care about this little baby at all, sadly.|`|HcMvtMT7aa	What is the question?  If you're asking for opinions, they are an abomination and a sin in every definition of the word.  I agree with you, might as well have the baby and give it up for adoption.|`|NCvX4I0baa	I don't get it either. You're really killing a life with a partial abortion because your baby has all the basic needs to function on his or her own with maybe some vitamins or meds to speed up the growth of his or her lungs.    It's just cruel.
ggETPqedaa	My baby was always extremely low and then when he dropped further later in the pregnancy, I literally waddled and I swear my belly was down at my knees. He started low and only grew lower and lower and lower. He was also positioned like that, then he flipped to be sideways, then he flipped to be diagonal finally he flipped head down. Though I ended up having a c-section because his head didn't drop as much as it should have and I didn't dilate.|`|AA11476951	Not sure but I wouldn't be too worried. Baby is still small and has time to get in the right position|`|rjVALevtaa	At 5 months, basically any position is normal. I was told that most babies don't get into their permanent position (usually head down) until week 36.
r39EDGhPaa	I think it's all good.  But they need to be using condoms too.    But I would hardly consider it being responsible.  Being sexually active at that age is far from responsible.|`|nKSmgjylaa	It's perfectly OK. My best friend had to go one birth control because she had very irregular periods, and this way if she does end up having sex she's protected. No, girls on BC aren't whores, they're mature women who are taking responsibility for their actions.|`|p0prrzf2aa	i always used my b/c so i'd have lighter periods. it was nothing to do with sex|`|FGZR9RwDaa	welll its better than them getting preggo.|`|2FhPfxnsaa	I have a very bland answer: that kids shouldn't be having sex at that age because they'll regret it later on, but at least they're being smart.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	I say only if it's to help with your period. Teens should be so active ,but if the do it protection is good to have.    I started when was 13 and I am 14 now. I had to use them because I had heavy 15 day periods and once even 19 days. I was anemic, worn down, exhausted, and my hemoglobin had drops 4.5 points in 4 weeks. I was even losing my hair and passed out when I tried to get up for school.|`|hzlqCBWnaa	13-15 yr old girls shouldent be having sex but birthcontrol is better then them getting pregnant!|`|NjDYAEbHaa	13 is to youung to loose your virginity.   I was 13 when i lost it and it was way to young, i think putting girls that age on BC is telling them its ok to have sex .. its really not. you should wait til at least 18 or 19.    i also think there needs to be more communication with parents and kids. my parents NEVER talked to me about sex or what could happen, not saying i didnt know but i think everyone thinks they wont have a kid, well suprise it happens.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	It's smart that they want to be safe but it's just disturbing knowing that 12 and 13 year olds are having sex...|`|a26UpHq1aa	to be honest know.. I bet it would make them sorta feel more relaxed.. Because even though I was not having sex in HS, I still wish I would have felt confident enought to A. go to my mom about it. B. It would make me not worry so much, with their being so many diseases out their, which may cause not to have a period. I am a Health Freak, and Yes because of Ovarian problems, I am now on the birth control. But I was 19 when I started taking it, now I am 21|`|j73bqzRAaa	i think being on birth control at a young age is good  and parents should put there kids on it young so that there arnt all there teen moms and all these questions am i pregnat  its amazing how a little thing like birth control can change a gurls life  i was 14 years old when i 1st had sex  and i was on birth control and yes iam still with that guy  and we couldnt be more happier|`|WtzKQVGXaa	I think the first thing that should happen is the parents should have a talk with them and let them know how important it is not to be having sex at that age. Alot of kids think that because they are on the pill they have free power to do whatever they want but the reality is that you can still get pregnant on the pill and you can catch sexually transmitted diseases... so of course the best course of action for this not to happen is not to have sex until they are ready to be a parent becuase there is no fool proof birth control except for not having sex.|`|MrNkNnhyaa	im 14 and im on bc,i have to because i get bad cists and i was in the hospital all last year.  but i don't think there is anything wrong with it|`|W7TLmkrNaa	I think every girl should be on birth control.  It helps and prevents a lot of pregnancys|`|1aOlZvlvaa	I agree with Corey
agfiNdLraa	You ovulated after the first test!!! ;)|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|YP3rEESUaa	The cramps are due to ovulation, I get them too, that's how I know I'm ovulating, and this is the best time to BD.

gm9dytgnaa	this is what my mom told me:     i wouldn't care if you smoked a joint with your friends at home, got the munchies, and did it in moderation. it's better then drinking.     she's pretty great :)|`|FHxDuMkJaa	Ok first of all, NO i wouldnt be mad.   I DONT smoke weed....but i really dont see what the big deal is...its a plant...it grows from the ground. Would you rather have your child drinking and gettin totally shiit faced and get alcohol poisoning mistakingly?...or smoke weed. SMOKE WEED. kids are gonna try things regardless... so i dont know.|`|RdatK8wlaa	Well, not much I could do. I would be a hypocrite if I were to punish them. Heck, I'd make them pass it to me! ;-)    I'm a teen, and I've talked to my mom, and she's cool, I mean, she's not LETTING me, but she said she'd rather not even know.    It really wouldn't matter to me (If I had kids) but if they get busted, they're on their own! I'm not bailing them out!|`|1gVDZrPuaa	If they did it on a daily basis and couldn't go without it, I would be pretty mad, but I understand how big pressures are these days so I could understand.  First try I wouldn't care, as long as they were just trying it.|`|j73bqzRAaa	i dont think its a bright idea  but kids will be kids and they are going to try it sooner or later  i would just want to know when where  with who  and for it to be just to try  not  to be addicted|`|0770fd55f95f18aa245026f830c7ded7aa	My mom didnt actually see me in the act but she did see me smoking weed. My mom was snooping in my room one afternoon while I was at school and found pictures me, my sister, and my friends took It was pictures of us smoking weed and drinking. She yelled at me, cursed me out, and told me to get rid of them and that was that.|`|ynAXDyQDaa	When I have a family, there will be a NO SMOKING rule in my house. Not me and my husband, not my kids, and not guests. I have asthma and I just can not stand smoke! It seriously feels like my lungs are closing up if i'm even like 50 feet away from a smoker.      edit:  I don't think smoking weed is that big of a deal, it's just the way my body reacts to it is the reason why I wouldn't allow it in my house.|`|8PIiHCZaaa	I guess it would depend first of all on how old my kid was when i caught him.  If its 16 or older, I probably wouldn't get mad unless it was some real garbage weed.  No son of mine is going to be smoking Nebraskan Ditch Weed.  If it was really good, his mother and I would sit him down and puff with him.|`|RAgWVuu4aa	I don't know how I would react...My mom said that she wouldn't mind if I did it once, just to try it...Weird...She trusts me, and I love her too much to hurt her badly...So...Hm...Still strange, though. She did it once when she was in her twenties...She said all it did was make her sleepy ( know one drug can have different affects on different people), and I'm guessing she didn't smoke much...She said it was at a party...    My dad was a hippie (not hardcore) back in the seventies, and I'm sure he smoked weed (my mom said he has), but I don't think he would be every happy...He wouldn't want me to...Ever...      I'm fifteen and I've never done drugs...Well, like cold medication for a cold and that kind of thing, but...Haha...Yeah.      I guess it if was my kid, I wouldn't be angry...I'd be kind of surprised and worried, and I would tell them about the consequences...I would ask where they got it and tell them not to make a habit of it...Preferably stop doing it altogether...I would also ask them if they had anything they wanted to talk about (personal problems are often an element in making the decision to take drugs.)    What would getting angry and secluding them do? Make them depressed, deepen their problems, and make them want to find more "releases?" Seriously, punishment like that is pointless...It would just make them angry. And random drug tests? Great way to lose your kids trust and make them even more upset...|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Yes it would matter. Your parents are acting like it is a big deal because IT IS A BIG DEAL. Whether you have decided that pot is dangerous or not, rest assured it is. Head to a local drug rehab. Ask each person there what drug they used first, and guess what the answer will be? You know those stupid commecials about, No one ever says I want to be a junkie when I grow up...well guess what they are true. If you were my child you would now be given random drug tests, and you would be spending an increased amount of time with your dear old parents. For me it would not matter if you did it continually or just tried it once, because how do I know it is the truth?|`|9c7nKTIkaa	At one point in their lifetime they will feel tempted to smoke weed by their peers or curiosity. I have smoked weed myself before and still do sometimes, but I know how to control myself. As for my kids. If i ever see my kid doing that i would beat the S%*T out of them. lol j/k even though it is morally wrong.
W7TLmkrNaa	depends.  usually about 10:30...|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	11ish. sometimes earlier, sometimes later. But if I go to bed much later I'm too exhausted to stay awake...|`|a26UpHq1aa	I try to be in bed early, but falling asleep before 1230-1 rarely happeneds|`|kC37dRRIaa	Usually around 11 or 12. 8 to 7 hours of sleep.

H74F8jxuaa	I ovulated on the 27 and I am expecting my af on the 10 or 11.  I am going to test sat. at 11 dpo and if it is negative, another 13 dpo and if it is still negative with no af then valentine's at 16 dpo.  Hope this gives you a hint.  I have been told you should wait 18 dpo and test, but I can't wait that long.|`|hnKRu0jwaa	I ovulated on the 24th i am having some cramping in my lower abdomen and back, I didn't get sore breast this month before AF and i usually do. I feel real queasy right now and I stay hungry. U could be having some implantation cramping cause on my 7dpo i had some cramping also and i still have it. Good Luck and lots of baby dust to us both,|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Im 3weeks and Im cramping up a storm.My period was due yesterday and i took a test an hour ago.I was intimate only once with my husband so I know how far along i am.Ive been cramping for about a week now. I think you can test as early as 3 weeks It worked for me.Hope this helps.
zbjaBgyEaa	It's a little alliterative if you catch my drift - too much of the k/c sound.    I think Catherine is gorgeous and sounds beautiful with Cole.  Very classic, very timeless and very pretty.    Maybe you could, like, substitute in another name.    Catherine Julia Cole  Catherine Layla Cole  Catherine Annabelle Cole|`|Elxuvon8aa	they all have the same K sound but with the three sylables two  then one it works I wanted to use laura Leigh Leonard|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i like catherine and kaelin but it just doesnt sound right to me all together with the last name, its too many kuh sounds.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Catherine is very nice and classy, but i don't care for Kaelin.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Kaelin is way over used today naming kids.  Boys even are named that.|`|Z6NlNRLoaa	Kaelin is kind of awful.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	I like Kaelin spelled differently, but i don't like the name because they all start with the same sound which keeps it from flowing.|`|J8x2qwVdaa	Luv it ! It's great..|`|xrJqmRFqaa	That's a nice name, although Kaelin is not my favorite.  Some suggestions:    Catherine Kaela Cole  Catherine Karen Cole  Catherine Lilly Cole  Catherine Lila Cole  Catherine Grace Cole  Catherine Hannah Cole|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	I LOVE the name Catherine - it is one of my all time favoritees, especially spelled that way. However I do not care for Kaelin. The two names sound too similar and do not flow at all. How about Catherine Audrey?|`|vwxmsUa2aa	Love Catherine.  I'm not too big on Kaelin and I also don't think it sounds good with Catherine.  How about..  Catherine Elizabeth Cole  Catherine Rachel Cole  Catherine Sophie Cole|`|VNqgwEPJaa	actually i really like kaelin cole but i really dont care for catherine its a played out name
Jswomud7aa	Just try to remain calm, you don't know anything yet. My cousin looked bigger and further along with every pregnancy (she has 4 kids), so it's normal to look bigger than you actually are the more times you go through pregnancy.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Multiples are NOT inhereited by the fathers line of history. So he could have 2,862,358,963 sets of multiples, would have nothing to do with him, or the chances of multiples. You are the one who releases the eggs, he simply gives you the remaining 23 chromosomes.|`|VClxXNs3aa	might be triplets....|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Why is your first appt so long from now?      You could be, but I have heard you start showing earlier than usual after your 1st, 2nd and so on.  I was afraid I was having twins, I am a twin and my husband is a triplet.  This is my first, and at 2 1/2 months I was already showing.  I had a sonogram and it was only one.  Good luck!|`|PBz4RiRiaa	This is your 5 child that does increase the chances of you having twins. Your age and weather twins run in your family (not his) all may increase the chance of twins. The only way you will know wether your expecting two or one is when you go to the doctors. good luck.|`|kG9oI68eaa	whatever you are given by God is a blessing and you will love however many babies you have
vKEYa8aeaa	honestly, cheating. if you think he would do that, thats the only thing that you really could worry about. my HS had grad night at disney world and everyone took a big greyhound bus down there [i went to high school right on the florida state line]. ALOT of people did bad things [sexual].|`|sKmQVwQMaa	if you don't trust him, break up.|`|drI1vsJdaa	If you actually trusted him you wouldn't have that problem.    STOP being clingy.
F8iyUqJBaa	I think that America has gone downhill in a big way.  There is so very little emphasis on abstinence and parents either aren't talking to their children or they have the mindset, they're gonna do it anyway, just let em.  It's really sickening and sad.  The influence that speaks so loudly is the TV and movies.  We do not watch TV in our house and our movies are very carefully selected.  We speak candidly and openly about our values and we choose to play game and have fun together rather than letting the influence into our house that corrupts the mind.  I am 33 and have 3 boys with a fourth one on the way and still desire to have a few girls.  We home birth and home school and are very pro-life, pro courting rather than dating.  It hurts me to see all of these children having children.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Who cares? Don't worry about what people think of you. They're going to think a certain way whether you like it or not and that's just the way it is. Live your life and be happy.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I don't really feel sorry for them. I think that if you get pregnant and still strive to finish school then that is great! However I am strongly against teen pregnancy and pregnancy before marriage. It makes me sad that people don't have enough cowmen sense to wear a condom while having sex. If you think about most teen mothers are single, you were fortunate, and they go through depression during and most of the time after pregnancy and they don't have enough income to raise a baby so the parents have to support a second child, which they don't deserve. When I see a pregnant teen, without a ring on,  I usually think they must be so selfish to indulge in their own pleasure without thinking of the consequences or of how this might affect other people.
JUlzjSBraa	i voted    i am not a fan of many of these names, and i am not alone because i saw a lot of thumbs down on the names!|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	i really like Bradlee Kade.|`|ENtaLmvbaa	all those names are absolutely horrible =(  poor kid.|`|xrJqmRFqaa	Voted!    My favorite for a girl is Penelopie Lee and my favorite for a boy is Kristofer Jaek.|`|Qlx1r9XSaa	Willow Renae and Robert Matthew are my favorites! I prefer Renae spelled Renee though, but both are nice. I also LOVE the nickname Robbie!|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I like:    Maia  Willow  Ellalie  Waverly  Aidyn  Mathew    Hope I help :)
puCOYwMmaa	I'd say it's nothing to worry about.  My midwife told me that your blood vessels get engorged down there and it's common to bleed a little after sex, especially if its vigorous.    Mention it to your doctor when you go, they'll most likely tell you not to worry.|`|W1p6LetFaa	This is totally normal after sex or even without the sex.  Most women have a little bitt of spotting at some point in their first trimester and this is completely NORMAL!!  I spotted at about 7 weeks.  It's a little startling to see at first, but unless you start passing major amounts of blood, then it is nothing to worry about.  You are just fine!  Congrats to you and best wishes to you and your little one!|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Yes.I had this happen and I rushed to the hospital.Its the penis hitting the cervix.They told me not to worry.Hope this helps.|`|kZFov1x6aa	my guess would be that your vagina is just a bit inflamed from this vigorous sex you just had, but if you think its more to be worried about then id call your doctor.. even if they normally wouldnt see you til later im sure they'd take a look at you if you think somethings wrong.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	It is normal.  It happened to be when I was 10 weeks pregnant.  My doctor said it was normal to bleed after sex, especially if it was a little rough.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	you should be seen by your family doctor in the least.  Bleeding during pregnancy is not good i would lay off the sex for a bit and perhaps ask your dr for some progesterone supps to strengthen your lining,|`|bpqxtkFfaa	YEP. Thats all normal.     Congrats and good luck    If the bleeding doesnt stop or get worse go to the ER|`|duinadV4aa	the doc told me it was normal the same thing happen to me at 5wks after sex and i am now 32wks don't worry about it you should be ok|`|mFZGIPcWaa	Totally normal...I bled all the time after sex when I was pregnant with my twins.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    yes its normal. As long as the bleeding doesnt get heavy and no cramps you are fine.    The cervix gets more sensitive while pregnant. And vigourous set can definitely irritate the cervix (due to blood flow through the body, and since sex was occuring more blood was present down thre - blood flow).    it is normal.  better to stay off sex until doctor gives the okay - for not a high risk pregnancy or anything.  but i know this is normal.    god bless x
HXfHkoSHaa	I had a urinary tract infection and didn't even know.  My doc's nurse called and told me and phoned in some antibiotics.  UTI's are very common in pregnancy.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	secretions are normal during pregancy.  The burning may be a UTI or a yeast infection.  If it's a UTI try drinking cranberry juice a lot.  A couple of bottles worth, or cranberry capsule if you don't like the taste.  It is safer than antibiotics in early pregnancy.  If it is a yeast infection then find one of the shorter yeast infection cures like the one that lasts for 1 or three days.  I've had both problems.  They are only irritating to you, not the baby, but what you choose to use as a cure CAN affect the baby.|`|FZ0sKgvzaa	i actually had a kidney infection..
drI1vsJdaa	She probably thought your brother had hurt your feelings, so she was trying to make you feel better.    I'd tell her that you appreciate her trying to make you feel better, but that it really hurt your feelings because you're self conscious.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	she's joking!|`|WoxMH0wZaa	Tell her how you feel and say you don't like it when she does that. Chances are that she doesn't know she's hurting your feelings, and thinks that she's just joking around with you. Tell her how it makes you feel and I bet you she will stop.|`|mgOj6Uucaa	its okay to have flat buns. enbrace it. ur always welcome @jack in the box. XDDDD [flatt bunss]
bcZSIphUaa	The signs of ovulation are there so there is a chance that you're pregnant.    DO you know the reason for your infertility?    DO you have PCOS?    Anyway, you know better than anyone that you may or may not be pregnant - it's now a waiting game : )      BABY DUST!|`|RPnJLiYuaa	i think you might be pregnant  the best thing to do is to go to a local doctor   then you should know who the dad is...  you might consider asking a teacher about this  they might seem mean, but they will help you out a lot|`|v7Xvow4Daa	Sounds like you did ovulate but it would be too soon to show any pregnancy signs. Wait two weeks and then test!!|`|RE6GBw0Baa	i do hope so hunni,    signs of ovulation are great as it mens there is a possiblity of being pregnant xxx    mwah let us know xxx
weadibPeaa	i started getting sick at 6 weeks to the day. thats when the boob soreness started getting really annoying too|`|qPCjUckvaa	My breasts were really sore ten days after conception.  I got a positive test two weeks after conception.  I started feeling nauseous about three weeks after conception and started feeling better about 16 weeks into my pregnancy.|`|G94NlpZ0aa	I started getting morning sickness about a 5-6 weeks after. My breasts were sore like 3 weeks after...    I think everyone is different though...|`|FI7jGGp1aa	Everyone is different. you could start feeling symptoms as early as a week. Every woman experiences pregnancy differently. May take you a couple days, weeks, even months. But don't stress or think about it all that much it is possible to have a phantom pregnancy. If you really wish to be pregnant your mind could create the symptoms all on its own. So just wait it out and play it safe. you will know soon enough weather or not you are. Good Luck!
Bu6eSZSlaa	It's because they are more often that not closer to their mom. We carried them for 9 mths, hold & soothe them when they cry & needs comforting, they know our scents & the warmth of our skins, they feel safe & secure in our arms....gosh saying that makes me want to go & hold my little one...unfortunately she's asleep :)|`|puCOYwMmaa	Children tend to get attached to their mother at a certain age because she has been the primary caregiver (due to breastfeeding, maternity leave, etc)     but it isn't necessarily the mother, it could easily be the father or a babysitter who spends a lot of time with the kid.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Dunno.  But my boyfriend wants kids way more than I do so odds are he'll be spending more time with it if we get married and have one.  So he will probably end up as the comforter (I hope).
HcMvtMT7aa	It won't miscarry just because you had your last baby 4 mos ago.  Why didn't you go get the Plan B pill?!  The reason doctors and OBGYNs are ademant about getting you on birth control after the birth of your baby is because if you get pregnant too soon, you can have serious complications.  Your body just carried a baby for nearly 10 months, your body hasn't had a chance to recover.  Seriously, I would've been waiting outside of the doctors office before they opened the next morning and I'm surprised you weren't!|`|kZFov1x6aa	of course you can get pregnant if the condom broke.. and you can miscarry a child at any stage
cc6de8e305c692ff47542b8dda4fcb7baa	There are many reasons to not get a period, not just from being pregnant.  Stress can also make you lose your period, as well as diet.  I don't *think* you can get pregnant from what you described as the situation.  However, if you would like to be sure, I think you should go to the doctor and get a blood test.  If it takes time to wait for the appointment, you can get a pregnancy test from the drugstore and check right away.  The blood test from a doctor would make you even more sure...Good luck!|`|89PV34Omaa	You can get pregnant even if he didnt go inside you. If it even rubbed against your vagina you could get pregnant. Take a pregnancy test.|`|AA11763588	More than likely, you aren't.    But keep in mind that there is sperm in pre-ejaculation, and if any sperm touched your vagina they can make their way to the egg.    When in doubt, take a test.|`|HVXtd2Ryaa	Take a pregnancy test.|`|ehfe97Zcaa	It's not completely impossible, but somewhat unlikely.|`|xgui1LAFaa	o yeah...|`|vEhL5pwXaa	no you cant be pregnant the seamen would have to hit your eggs, and that didnt happen so your fine, just sick|`|eMEgu2eyaa	if his penis didnt go in your vagina then you cant be pregnant.|`|nIjxloUgaa	do a test|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I am not a pregnancy test.  I have no idea.|`|HcMvtMT7aa	It takes about 8-12 weeks for most women to experience symptoms.  Eww...he blew it on your butt when you had the flu!  Wrap it up next time, will ya?!|`|5zu7AdlKaa	if u havent started in a week take a test the fact that you are sick and stressing out about could be why its late|`|YmBCjSrLaa	the mind is a powerful thing and because you are thinking about it could delay your period, the only way you could be pregnant is if the *** went in or on your kat, take a pregnancy test anyways they only cost like 6 bucks.|`|a98bbd463a2e7fa4c45d9cfea4b5cb08aa	If it never went inside, then it seems extremely unlikely that you are pregnant.  To help you sleep better at night, take a pregnancy test.

W7TLmkrNaa	I know how ya feel.  No joke.  I would end it before you get hurt..  It'll hurt even if you do break up, but you don't want things to get worse.  If you aren't ready for sex don't do it. Its your choice so don't feel pressured at all. Don't give it to him cause he wants it, cause then he'll probably just come around just to get some, and you don't want to be a booty call. .   I know you do love him, but think of yourself and how your feelings are getting hurt over it  I'm going through the same thing, we are the same ages as you guys, and i wasn't pressured to have sex, but we did..   Guys, don't really realize how much pain they put us girls through with the little things they do, like not calling each other your normal nick names and such.    Good luck!|`|Mq27Wg5aaa	Well he's prob tired of waiting because he knows that your not going to give in to having sex with him. He prob just feels he can be like a but so that you can call things off with him, so he doesnt have to. Or there could be a possibility that he is talking to another girl and has just lost interest in you. I cant really explain it no differently then I am. Just go with your heart, but if i was you i wouldnt let the relationship go any further. I would ask him hey whats goin on why are you acting like this and those kind of questions. If he doesnt give you a good answer then yea i would break it off. So i hope things work out with you and hope for the best...Glad I could help...if you ever need to talk about things like this or need help you can contact me by email...wildchild1590@yahoo.com|`|mygpnrK1aa	One piece of advice I received about relationships was to never listen to his words, but 'listen' to his actions. It's heart-breaking to lose someone you care about, but it's common to drift apart. You need to take a good look inside and ask yourself if you are willing to compromise your morals for this guy. If you truly love each other, you can come to some sort of agreement where you both feel good about it. If not, dump him and move on. Good luck to you--
vKEYa8aeaa	of course, some women even plan to have their baby shower after the baby is born..its just a personal preference.     good luck! and i hope everything goes smoothly as possible.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	My son was 4-5 months old when we did his shower. Didn't bother me none...in fact I liked it better...everyone got to meet him and hold him.|`|HcMvtMT7aa	Yes, go ahead with the baby shower!  It'll be a treat to actually have the baby there at the party!  But rethink it after you have had the baby because you may be too exhausted to go through with it.|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	Go ahead with it. That way everyone gets to see the baby. Thats how we do it in my church. All of our baby showers are after the baby is born. So we all get to say oohh awww but usually the baby sleeps the whole time so games and every thing still get done|`|XCueIYnYaa	That happened to a friend of mine, her son was less than a week old when she had her shower. Everyone was so excited to have him there.   Its perfectly fine, and really neat for the baby to attend the shower were all the gifts are for them!|`|AAbGMKo5aa	Go on with the plans no matter what...    My baby shower was supposed to be, october 30 2003 and my baby was born october 28 2003 acouple of day earlier..    So my mother in law just did a welcome home :-]|`|bO1gUExAaa	I would go ahead with the shower, unless you aren't going to be up to it. Or like so many mothers with new babies don't want him/her to be poked and prodded and passed around then I would say no don't.  Otherwise you may even get a nap out of it, with all those people to help out.|`|DBKV3g4baa	It's a matter of personal preference.      Many women purposely plan a shower or "welcome baby" party after the birth.  When opening gifts, the baby is passed to the gift giver to hold and play with, thus everyone gets a little bit of one-on-one time with baby.    Other women tend to avoid events like this where baby will be exposed to many people and potential illnesses.  It really depends on your comfort level.
