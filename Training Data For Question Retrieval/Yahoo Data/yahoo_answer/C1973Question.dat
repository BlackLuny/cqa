I am having a new phone sent but want to transfer the data (pictures mostly) from my old one onto the new one. I have been told I can transfer it onto my PC and then back onto the new phone but don't know how to do this. I assume relevant cables etc. would have come with the phone if this is possible???

Is it possible, or common for someone to steal your identity(credit card numbers, social security  ....) if say you buy a used t-mobile cell phone, activate it under your name, and they wrote down that imei/esn number, and work or know someone that works for t-mobile or any of the other companies that deal with cell phone activations. How easy is it for someone to see/obtain your personal information. Can any employee or only someone with the proper clearance?
20090203073158AAuanUg	Consumer Electronics;PDAs & Handhelds	Could you connect to wifi through blue tooth?	I'm a little ignorant concerning the communication protocols for these things or if there would even be an advantage to it over and against connecting through your cellular network (maybe even if you could get data through that path, the data transfer speed of blue tooth is too slow to make it worthwhile). I am looking at getting a BB Storm (I'm not interested in discussing all the other pros/cons of this choice), and so I was wondering if this was even possible or even if it had already been done?

20081107165711AAE0BbZ	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	How do you get audio when playing a PS3 on a computer monitor?	So I've figured out how to get video playing a PS3 on a monitor (using a HDMI-to-DVI cable), but I'm not sure how to get audio. I thought it was as simple as plugging in the HDMI-to-DVI cable and using my computer speakers but apparently that's not the case.      I have surround sound 5.1 speakers (a lower-tier Logitech one). Can someone please give step-by-step instructions on how to get audio for a complete noob? 
20081107170952AALkQPn	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Having playstation 3 issues - no display on tv when turning on ps3.  What gives?  Have tried 2 tvs.?	My stepson brought over his ps3 and we tried hooking it up to 2 different hd tvs using two different hdmi cables, however after powering on the ps3 we were not able to get any display on either television when turned to the hdmi channels.  He knows his playstation works because he was using it at his dad's house right before he came over to our house.  So it kind of seems like there should be nothing wrong with either the tvs, the hdmi cables, or the ps3.      I also have a ps3 however I recently sent it in for repair because I was  basically having  the same problems with it, however I tried it on one tv only.  In addition however, my ps3 was crashing frequently and could not be turned off by holding down the power button in front, I had to turn it off using the switch in back, so I'm pretty sure there was something seriously wrong with my ps3.  My stepsons ps3 however does not have issues with crashing and we can turn it off using the power button in the front of the machine.      So I'm kind of at a loss as to what's going on.  I find it hard to believe both of my hd tvs are having problems.  The hdmi output on the main hd tv was working just fine a week ago (right before I sent in my ps3 for repair).  I also find it hard to believe both of the hdmi cables (mine and his) are not working, and I also find it hard to believe there's something wrong with his ps3 which was working just great earlier today on the tv at his house.      So does anyone have any ideas on what's going on?  This is a very bizarre problem and it seems like there shouldn't be wrong with anything.  Maybe it's the way I'm hooking things up, but it's not like it's extremely complicated to hook up a ps3.  Any input is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
