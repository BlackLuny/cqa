I recently moved into a duplex owned by a friend grandfather, and was very excited to find a woodstove insert in addition to the baseboard heating. However, I quickly found that the insert currently installed is not quite as nice as we would have hoped.      I'm now looking to replace it, but neither Opa (our landlord) or I can afford a new stove. I've been looking at used stoves, but have no idea really of what to look for. I want something capable of heating at least 1000 sq./ft. preferably as long burning as possible.      Can anyone suggest brands or types that might be helpful? Also any questions I should ask in regards to their condition, etc?

It doesn't do this when you leave it on all the time or off all the time. Only when it cycles. When I increase the "on" time (30on/30off) it loses 4" of water over about a week. The cycle timer cuts/applies power to the outlet that the hot tub is plugged into. I have no cover on the hot tub. I can not find any evidend of a leak.
