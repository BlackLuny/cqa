20090304163239AAiP9a1	Health;Women's Health	Why do I look pregnant?	My stomach is so bloated that it looks swollen and protrudes like I might be pregnant (which I am not.) My pants are so uncomfortable and are digging into me. I can't disguise this. I am 5'7" and 145 pounds which is average - so I am not fat. I have got occassional bloating in the past because of constipation. But, this has lasted 3 days now and I have taken a laxative and am not constipated. Usually, my stomach is flat in the morning and gets bloated later in the day. Three days is too long - I am uncomfortable, ugly, and in pain. My period is still a week and a half away - so it isnt period bloating. The bloating is in the area above my navel. WHat causes this and what on earth can I do. Its so gross!

I was bitten by my neighbors pit bull dog today.He basically let the dog run after me and it bit me on the arm breaking the skin.The owner of the dog found it a few months ago and kept it.It was a stray.So he took the dog today and "got rid of it or hid it" so animal control could not find the dog to see if it had rabies.He has 24 hrs to produce the dog.My question is,if he does not bring the dog to  animal control,I probably will have to have the rabies shots just in case? Would it be bad for you to have the rabies shots even if the dog does not have rabies? cause basically he's not going to give the dog up to animal control so I would have to go through the shots even if the dog turned out to not have rabies cause of him hiding the dog and not allowing them to test it....how are these shots going to effect me even if I might not of been subjected to rabies? I guess I am seeking some medical advice here?

Long story... this guy caused one of my upper front tooth to chip by punching me closed fists and I also had to get stitches near my eyebrow as well. But that's not why I'm here for. People say it's not very noticeable unless they look very carefully. Although it does look smaller than my other tooth next to it and all chipped up. I'm not very worried about the cut with stitches as it can heal. But my tooth? Yeah I got really frustrated because I have really nice teeth and the guy mest this one up, the front one, the most noticeable one. Can dentists fix this and make it look like nothing happen? Thank you so much in advance. :D
20090304224143AAZSC8L	Health;Mental Health	Are these thoughts normal?	Well, Im kind of shy and quiet, but recently I have been refusing to go to school. I just don't seem able to face school. On Monday, my dad drove me to school, because i had been stalling and missed the bus, and I was in such a horrible state. I was crying and i had a box of matches in my bag and i swore to myself that If my dad did make me go to school that day I would burn down the school. I thought specifically of burning 100 block because I remember my teacher telling me it was full of asbestos. I told my friend about it and she said that she didn't mind of the school burnt down but she did mind if I lit the fire, she said that I could kill heaps of people, but to be honest I hate everyone at my school and i would sit back and listen to there screams with pleasure. I have overdosed on pills before ( 28 pills) and I tried a bit of nail polish remover on one of my days off. And I completely hate my whole family. I have seen the school councilor but it didn't help at all.   I was just wondering if you would be able to give me some advice and tell me if my train of thoughts is normal.

I don't masturbate that much, maybe once every two weeks or even once in a month, anyways the first time i masturbate was by chance, i was cleaning my self with the water sprayer in the toilet and the pressure of the water was sooooo strong and i had my first orgasm.      however i continued using this method in masturbation for like 3 years every week, finally i stoped....      recently i tried to masturbate with my finger, i didn't feel anything, i don't know why when i lay down and masturbate i should push my legs to the maximum and rub down there as hard as i can then i get to orgasm in like 1 or 2 minutes,       Why i can't masturbate in a normal way?? do i have weak nerves down there from the water spray thingy? how can i fix that problem? thanks alot.

I'm not sexually active or anything like that, so it can't be an STD. I don't shave either. The only time it has been hairless is when I first got it and I cut it all off with a pair of scissors. But anyway, I don't know what to do. It'll come and go, and I sometimes feel bumps on it. I would really like an answer. And please, no rude comments.

20090305000142AAd2hQ7	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	How can I stop being so gassy?	for a while I used to be constipated, then I learned that I should eat more fiber. some of the foods I learned that contained fiber were wheat bread, oatmeal, and apples. but as soon as I started having more fiber, I began to be gassy all the time. I think it's the fiber, it's making me really gassy. I've never been so gassy before. I want to know how I can stop, because I hate it. when I used to be constipated I would go to the bathroom each week. I don't mean one day each week, it would be random. but I'd never went everyday, no matter how much I eat. but now, since I've had more fiber I would go to the bathroom everyday, and do it about 1-3x a day, early in the morning. I want to stop being so gassy. sometimes it's loud, sometimes it's quiet. but I don't want to be constipated again.

20090304225743AAgp1SD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Diabetes has ruined my health, my looks, my life!?	I need help. Diabetes has ruined me. I was just an 18 year old college student when diagnosed. I was good looking, in good health, and had it all. Before diagnosis I had decent eyesight. After I needed surgeries on my eyes and had cataract on both eyes and vitrectomy. Before diagnosis I lost 30 pounds. I lost much hair and my eyebrows. After diagnosis I grew my hair back but my eyebrows look like the worst eyebrows ever. They are like grandpa eyebrows that I need to trim weekly and they still look horrible, pointing in all weird directions and they are very wirey like straw. When I squint they move up and down which bugs me a lot since I also have OCD. I have lost all enjoyment of life. I used to love talking to girls but now whenever a cute girl looks at me from far away I am afraid to talk to her up close because my eyebrows look so terrible. I can no longer eat what I want. I used to love eating hamburgers and milkshakes and pizza. I can no longer eat these foods anymore. I have to watch the amount of alcohol I drink. My blood sugar is all over the place at times when stressed. I wear an insulin pump which helps a tremendous amount but thats about it.      I am only 20 years old and I feel like I'm 50. I can not imagine ever finding a girl that is not only pretty and has a great personality, but also accepts my diabetes, poor eyesight, ugly old man eyebrows and everything else that comes with this disease. I feel so depressed right now I wish I could start life over.      Thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated.
20090304233548AA0rI3A	Health;Mental Health	Can depression cause someone to have disabling sleep patterns to this degree?	I've had problems with sleeping since I was around 12 years old. I'm almost 29 now, and it still affects me greatly.   I've also been depressed and suffered from anxiety attacks all of my life. Some of my earliest memories involve this.    I seem to jump from one degree (insomnia) to the other degree (over-sleeping). My sleep pattern is very rarely "normal".    I often hear people complain if they only get a few hours of sleep. I can stay awake for 3 days no problem. And I often do because I am just not tired.   On the flip side, some days I am so tired that it truly disables me. Getting dressed seems like a huge task because my whole body feels groggy. When I was younger and I had to get up for school, I would fall asleep standing up in the shower. On these days, I can easily sleep 18 hours if I am not disturbed.    I've thought of the obvious reasons, that I may have a sleep disorder. But I don't think that I do. My husband says that I don't shift around a lot in my sleep, I don't sleepwalk or talk in my sleep, and I don't snore or have abnormal breathing patterns.    I've tried numerous times to set myself a normal schedule which would allow me to get the correct amount of sleep. But it may work for 1 or 2 days and then I fall right back into my yo-yo mode.    My sleeping patterns make it really hard to lead a normal life. I miss out on a lot of activities because either I am too tired or I'm wide awake ready to conquer the world at 3 in the morning when no one else is.    My doctor says I am physically healthy when I go in for my check-ups. But I've never had any extensive tests done. So I guess my question is does this sound psychological to you? Or do you think it could be something physical? And what could it be for this many years?   Thanks!

20090304232007AA8K2PO	Health;Other - Health	Why do I get headaches every day?	For quite a few months now, I have been getting headaches quite regularly. Sometimes it is just a really, really painful, unbearable one and that is all I get all week. But mostly I'm just getting normal headaches about once a day, maybe every 2 days.    Also when I get out of bed in the morning, everything goes blurry and I black out for about 2-3 seconds before it clears. It's the worst when I first get up, but if I sit down or lie down for a while then get up the same thing happens. I have to be lying down usually for about 30 minutes minimum for this to happen.    About a year and a half ago I was in hospital for a week with orbital cellulitus and I had sinus probelms for about 6 months after that - I was on antibiotics for a few months. All that has gone now though and I'm 98% sure this is nothing to do with my sinuses.    These headaches don't have anything to do with my period because they are happening all the time.    I usually don't eat breakfast but if I do (which is about twice a week) I have a yoghurt and banana smoothie. For lunch I have a roll with lettuce and tomato on it and sometimes a cookie or chocolate or soft drink (eek I know, unhealthy). For after noon tea I have usually maybe like 3 biscuits or something to that extent. For dinner I always have a healthy dinner, something different almost every night (my parents are very into gourmet cooking) with meat every night. I don't usually have dessert.    I am 14, which is young yes but please don't give me some bullshit like it's because I'm growing - I haven't grown for about a year, so I have stopped.    I don't do much excerise, I go on a 30km bike ride every Saturday and that is it.    Another thing I would like to know about (not sure if this is related to the headaches) but why is I am always very very tired when I get home from school each day and feel I could sleep for hours and hours. Sometimes ( I try not to) if I don't have homework or assignments (ver VERY rarely) I fall asleep at 4:30 and wake up at 7:30 but go back to sleep at about 9 and wake up at 7 the next morning, still feeling like I could sleep for longer. I haven't always had this, this tiredness has only started in the last 2 months.    Why is it that I'm always tired and getting headaches about every 2 days, sometimes every day??

20090304230715AAE9MjC	Health;Women's Health	I took Plan B & got a period a week after. Should I tell my gynecologist about this period?	My bf was just trying to put his head in me, but it was too big so we stopped after about 15 minutes of trying. He had a condom on at first, but then took it off. (He has low-sperm count & I'm still a virgin if that matters). I took plan B like about 23 hours later. He thought it was unecessary, but you never know!       A month before I took Plan B I decided  since I'm 20 now it was time to visit a gyno and see if everything is okay, even though I haven't had real sex...it's still good to make sure you're fertile & healthy. Plus, I have irregular periods & severe pains in my lower left abdomen. The Gyno told me to do a chart of when my period comes & how many days it lasts & to go back 8 weeks later. I have to go back on April 1st I think. I took Plan B while I was in the end of my period (brownish light red bleeding) on Feb. 26. Then, 6 days, or a week later (pretty much right now) it started off VERY light & now it's full on bright red. It's never been this red & I had extreme bloating & cramps but no vaginal pain I always get vaginal pain when I have my real period. It feels like my muscles down there tighten up when on the real period. Should I tell her about this "fake" period that i got like 7 or 8 days after my other period before Plan B?       I don't want to tell her because...well my mom goes with me to go see her & they chat if you know what I mean. They all know that I am or...was a virgin. He didn't go all the way in so I am not sure to consider myself one anymore. So, I really don't want my mom knowing...and she ALWAYS goes with me. My appointments are on  wednesdays & my mom is off on wednesdays. I just don't want her to know I took Plan B. It's embarassing! I don't know what to do...I need some advice..I'm not sure if I wanna see this Gyno anymore. She shouldn't tell my mother nothing that is going on with me if I don't want my mom to know right?      Should I just wait til my next real period comes after this one & then write it down on the chart? I had one from Feb. 19th- to about Feb.26th.

20090304232441AA1TtYZ	Health;Dental	I got my wisdom teeth removed a week ago, now one of the sockets is pussy, smells bad and tastes HORRIBLE?	As the title said, I got 3 of my wisdom teeth pulled a week ago (I had one pulled in the middle of last year)      Two of the three sockets have healed almost completely, but the third is still very painful. My cheek is swollen still, and the socket has some...I guess loose flesh flopping around, when I looked at it, it looked like the socket had a tongue or something.      But that isn't my problem. It's also oozing a very disgusting yellowish-red ooze that switches between being pussy and liquidy.   It tastes NASTY! My face is constantly twisted, and I always feel like I'm going to puke. THAT'S how bad this is. The dentist isn't willing to see me because we haven't paid our bill yet, so I'm stuck here swishing with salt water and hydrogen peroxide.      Does anybody have any suggestions as to what could be wrong, and what I can do about the taste? I've been brushing my front teeth and my tongue, but it doesn't help because my socket is constantly letting it loose.

He told me that he would give me a free rectal exam and i agreed. So anyways, he made me put on a blindfold and went at it for about an hour. Usually rectal exams do not take so long and the funny thing was that he had both hands on my shoulders when he was doing it. When he was done he told me i was fine and ran off before i could thank him. Was this guy truly a good doctor or did I just get raped?

20090304230557AA6EAcY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Question for guys mostly: would u be able to get over this?	Someone that I really connected with on all levels left me a month ago because I unknowingly gave him hpv. Note- not hiv, but hpv, a VERY common and much less serious std that up to 75% of females will have at least once in their lifetimes. One that often does not show any signs, so there is no way of telling whether you have it. My pap smears had been normal, and we always used protection. It's only when I started getting symptoms that we realized I, and now he, had hpv (because it's very contagious and sexual exposure pretty much guarantees your partner will get it, with or without protection because it's through skin to skin contact).       Because std's have always been his biggest nightmare, he decided he needed time on his own to deal with his new reality. After researching everything there is to research on this subject so I could give him all the facts (so he could try to understand that this virus really isn't the end of the world especially because your immune system CAN get rid of it within 2 years), I've given him his space.       At this time though (about a month ago) he said, 'I do like you amberlee, but I just feel like I need time on my own to come to terms with this'. And then I said that I completely understood, but that I couldn't see any reason why we couldn't still hang out, just not hook up... and he agreed.       I'm just wondering whether you think there's a chance things will ever be the same way between us again. We had sensational chemistry, which is something he commented on a lot. Especially about the kind in bed. Guys, If you say you really like a girl, but need time, do you mean it? Or are you just letting her down easy? Also, the night we discovered I had hpv was the night he introduced me to his family... so I know he honestly cared for me. Plus he would always say how there were so many things about me he liked...And before I came along, he hadn't been with a girl for 2 years because he was waiting for the right one (even though girls are drawn to him like magnets...he's absolutely beautiful inside and out...just terrified of stds)..

20090304231434AAu3VvD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	What are the negative health effects of smoking hookah?	I've tried looking it up and have found so many contradicting answers for this. I know hookah definitely has tar in it (any sort of plant combustion produces at least a minute amount of tar), and obviously the natural nicotine from tobacco is present, but is this enough to cause cancer akin to cigarette/cigar smoking? One source claimed that a study found that one 40-minute hookah session was the same as smoking 50 cigarettes in terms of chemical inhalation, but I'm not sure if that's entirely believable. My friends and I have recently started smoking hookah pretty regularly, and I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything to my body that I'll regret later (no temporary buzz is worth even one day of chemo-- to me, anyway.)
20090304230546AAmS8XI	Health;Mental Health	I feel depressed, due to friendship problems.?	i am in year eight and go to high school, middle school whatever you call it. im 13 I started my secondary school as a rough start. One person was bullying me because she was a fat, ugly idiot who thought it was fun to pick on people who aren't. im not stuck up or anything, but people do say im pretty and thin. I started off pretty popular till that girl came and ruined it all. I have been single for two years, no boyfriend at all and the ones that like me are losers.       Adventually i had to deal with this bullying and this girl acted like my friend and took all my friends. She hates me and then i moved class with my other friend. I met new friends and started off fresh again. Then my friend got a boyfriend and thinks got pretty rocky, my friend changed and started acting like she was too good for us. Pretty soon, it ended up bad and my friend left class too my enemy from the other one class. They made all the people from that class hate me and all the popular ones. I feel lonely because i only have a few close friends who occasionally make me feel left out and yell at me for no reasons. I sometimes feel sorry for myself, which is a bad thing. I know i sound too stuck up or something but im pretty quiet and loud once you get to know me. What should i do? everybody hates me for no reason, im probably going to be single forever now and yeah what should i do?

20090304231945AAB36DB	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Should I go to the hospital?  (Kidney Infection)?	So, on Sunday my back and my sides started hurting on the right and the left (but more so on the right back side).  It felt like a really sharp pain.  I knew I was getting a kidney infection because I get them often (like once or twice a year in the past 2 1/2 years which is unusual). so I went to the doctor yesterday (Tuesday) because the pain did not get any better it actually got worse and started to feel like someone punched me in the back.  Any way the doctor told me that I have a kidney infection and strep throat (double wammy) and perscribed me lavaquin or something like that.  He said it was the strongest anitbiotic they have.  So I have only been on this medicine for 2 days and have taken it as directed, but I haven't gotten any better at all...my temperature is slightly higher than normal at 99.5 degrees fahrenhiet and stable (it's been like this since Sunday).  My headaches have gotten worse as well as my back pain.  I'm debating whether or not I should go to the hospital tonight or if I should just give it another day to have the medicine set in.       Btw my doctor didn't exam me at all, I just showed him where the pain was and he said "oh yeah, thats a kidney infection".  He took some blood and said he'd have my results back by Friday or Saturday (a lot of good that does me).  Last time this happened I was hospitalized for 4 days because my white blood cell count was like 35,000. But like I said they don't have my test results yet for this incident.      Bottom line...go to the hospital or no?

Hi, I went running yesterday and about an hour afterward I noticed my foot was a little sore but nothing too bad. Then I did homework and rested for a while and noticed when I got back up it was even more sore. Then this morning it was to the point where it was pretty painful to walk on. Its just a sharp pain on the outside of the outside edge of my foot.        I'm pretty active and I've never really had any feet/ankle problems in the past (just 2 knee surgeries), but I was thinking I might have rotated my foot wrong when running or something. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions what it might be.  I can't exactly stay off of it, I have to walk around campus so hopefully that won't damage anything.    Any input would be helpful, Thanks!

20090304232553AAIUgba	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Can Protected Sex still has chances of getting STD/HIV, even when the ejaculation isn't done inside?	My bf and I are in our mid20s and we have been together almost 6months. He is my FIRST bf and I am his THIRD gf. I was a virgin before we had protected intercourse for the first time day before yesterday. We prefer protected always. He is extremely understanding, honest and trustworthy, I'm no doubt very fortunate. He never ever pressured me for anything! We both think, we are soul mates, that's how much we love each other. He told me the truth that he had protected intercourse with his first gf (who was a virgin) four years back and they both used protection. He didn't have sex with the second gf but they were together for 3months in mid2008. Then, came me and after 6months of relationship, we decided having protected sex. He used protection, everything was fine, I didn't use protection. Even thought we used protection, he didn't ejaculate inside me. I don't know why I'm being paranoid that I can catch a STD/HIV somehow, is that even possible?? I'm just being paranoid and silly I think. Looking at him physically, he is healthy and has fine body and genitals (i.e. no wart or other signs of std). He is very nice that I even talked abt my fear with him and he clarified things. He said, he had protected sex both times, with the first virgin gf and now I was the second, so it was always risk-free for him and shouldn't worry me at all. I still want to ask you guys considering both of our past histories, is that possible to catch anything?? I have anxiety problems and it was my first time, that's why I'm being extremely paranoid.      THANKS IN ADVANCE!

Due to the fact I had an uncle with severe tourette's, and the fact that I may have a minor form of it, is there a possibility I have Bipolar disorder?       Over the past year, I've gone through weeks of depression, and phases that made me feel like I could take on the world and life seems like nothing could ever go wrong.   During the depression times, I lost a lot of weight (about 10 pounds) and I felt like I would really do the world a favor if I died or something. Then I went through happy phases a while after the depression, and I felt like life was all joy and happiness.   And sometimes between the two extremes, I'm irritable and rather grouchy, to the point where my friends notice (and get rather irritated at me).      Could this possibly be the bipolar disorder that sometimes accompanies tourette's?

(I was 16 years old when had the surgery, but am a late bloomer. 17 now)Or if it did would it only effect that limb/ bone of that leg? How do you know that because that bone might  be shorter then what the lenght it originally was going to be, it has told the other leg/bone/limb to not grow as long.  Is this even possible, if not or if so, why?      I guess this couldnt be right cause some people loose a whole leg at like 10 years old but you dont see them with the lenght of a leg of a 10year old when there growen up.      What i want to know if a growth plate in a knee is damaged some way/how does the opposite growth plate on the other side of the body take sympathy of the damaged growth plate and try to make the bone lenght the same as the other. Does this ever occur? If this is not correct/likely how do you know,how would you do tests to find out?

20090304234209AAXoVP3	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Severe nausea among other problems.?	Hi, everyone. I have a severe problem that I desperately want some answers to; please only answer this question if you have medical education to back up your response or experience (personal or firsthand maybe) regarding the question.      I suffer from severe nausea (which is a HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE problem for me, because I also have a very intense form of emetophobia, which is a debilitating fear of vomiting) and it occurs quite frequently.  My nausea is very often associated with a headache/migraine/dizziness. I breifly told a doctor about this, and he prescribed zofran--a very powerful anti-nausea--for my problems. However, tonight I am experiencing nausea to the point where I think i may throw up (God forbid) and I have taken five zofran pills already and my nausea is so severe that I still feel like I'm going to throw up soon even after five of these very powerful pills.      My nausea occurs all the time, but it occurs at its worst in the late nighttime (right now it is 2:30 a.m. my time and i've been feeling sick since around midnight) or in the early morning. When my nausea occurs at nighttime, I am more likely to experience bowel problems with it (having several bowel movements in the period of two hours, gas, mild diarrhea).  When it occurs in the morning, I am more likely to have a bad headache/migraine with the nausea. Whenever it occurs, it gets way worse AND i feel dizzy if I lay down or close my eyes--this instantly makes it five times worse.      I have no clue what could be causing such severe nausea so often, especially to the point where powerful medicine doesn't help. I'll be making myself a doctor's appointment soon, but in the meantime, any ideas what could be causing this?

It's as if there's a little drop of water distorting the vision. I'm mean, that's what it looks like to me, that's not what it is.      I went to the opthamologist and he did all kinds of tests with my eyes dilated. They even did some sort of a laser scan and he showed me a sideview image of my retina. He says there is absolutely no evidence of anything at all wrong in that eye other than one small (hard, yellow, non-confluent) drusen which is far from the focal area and cannot be affecting central vision.       Has anyone else come across this problem? I'm not looking for a diagnoses, just wanted to hear from anyone else who's experienced this.thanks.

20090305001030AAjBe3G	Health;Mental Health	Memory problem! Has this ever happened to you?	Today was kinda a weird day for me cuz i realized that i've been entering the wrong pin number for my debit card for the last week. This is really scary because i frequently use the card (it's my only card) and i just can't believe that i hadn't noticed that i was typing in totally different numbers into the atm. I knew something was wrong when an atm said that it couldn't identify my pin number but at that time i was using a wells fargo atm instead of my bank's atm machine so i didn't think anything of it except that the machine needed some maintenance. It never occurred to me that i might be typing in the wrong numbers until today at the grocery store when the cashier told me it wouldn't go through. That's when it really hit me that the numbers i had been entering for a week now were actually the last 4 digits of my ssn! I was totally freaking out inside my head while the grocery line starting getting longer with curious eyes pointed suspiciously at me. I was so embarrassed and afraid that i just left cuz i didn't even have cash on me. i realized already what my pin actually was but even still it feels like their not the right ones. I'm really scared! I just need to know if anything like this has ever happened to any of you and how important was the information that u forgot? I'm only 20 but i feel like my memory is failing me already. sorry for the long story but any input would be great.   Thanks everyone :)

This is not the life I wanted for myself . I wanted to learn parkour and be really athletic, learn to play the guitar , get an education (not mug up crap and vomit it on paper) I used to eat really healthy back home to the point where eating even a little processed food used to hurt my stomach now I can't seem to put the junk food down which pretty much is adding to the depression.Please don't get me wrong I have no urge to look like a model .I am or rather was a genetically thin person but with emotional binge eating I've gained 15 pounds and I'm Truly not comfortable with my body . I know I should talk to someone but I dint feel like I have any real friends who would care but would rather be happy to hear that I'm unhappy . My skin now is full of acne and my hair is falling out .I tell myself everyday that today will be different but everyday is the same...I need help ...I cant seem to handle my life anymore...I'm so scared !

20090305003833AAWY0Pr	Health;Mental Health	Why is everyone on yahoo so horrible to people with eating issues?!?	I have eating issues (yes after years i can finally admit it) and in the past i've asked questions on here that weren't in anyway rude or offensive or pro-e.d and yet most of my answers are usually abusive, judgemental and critical! I don't mind if people tell me i need help in a polite way but most of it is people ranting like i've commited a crime!   There are deep deep reasons behind my problems that none of the users know, yet they still feel the need to hurl judgemental often hurtful comments.   Most people with e.d's aren't losing weight in a self-obsessed vain attempt to look better than everyone else. It's got nothing to do with that. If someone in a wheelchair wrote a question would you hurl abuse at them?   Mental illness is tough and thank god im finally in early recovery process.   But seriously, its judgemental, critical people that make girls develop e.d's!   So back off, it's an illness as much as anything else is, you can't choose whether to get it or not.   Don't live your life so ignorantly or pathetically.   Keep strong anyone affected by e.d's out there.   xxx

The only one in my family that understands what I'm going through is my sister, Megan, who lives 2 1/2 hours away from me and the reason why she understands is cuz her story is exactly like mine.[shes 23]   I am almost wanting to tell my parents I wanna move in with her because I can't take it here anymore. This town is the worst town to live in ever and all the people here are so judgemental.   My dad is usually never there for my family because he works all the time and I never really talk to him.   My brother picks on me all the time and calls me names and all of that and somedays I wanna kill him....literally.   I also always put myself down and has everyone else.   I want a gf but I can't get that either cuz I don't have "the looks".   The only fun things I can do is go to the movies.    That's it.   It seems like my friends are ignoring from doing anything with me.    I have no idea how I'm going to tell my best friend that I'm not gonna be at the high school next year when her other best friend just moved.   I have no clue what to do anymore.   I feel like my life is going down hill.   I am 98% sure that I wanna do something bad to myself.   I've already slit my wrists before but I keep thinking of suicide.   The only thing that takes the depression away is hanging with my friends and going to the movies.   I just don't know what to do anymore.   I can't keep living like this.   I've been told that its going to get better when I know its not   So someone please help me.   I need some help.   Quickly.   Please no negative comments.   Please help.

(She did work at Mcdonalds about 8 years ago but she was 'let go' after the 3rd day for not being able to perform the job.)   -Cannot drive, she has a license but my dad locked it up, and won't let her drive the car.   -Is constantly lazy, she thinks she does alot of work but the truth is she doesn't. The whole house is full of clutter and trash. All she does is wash the dishes (which she doesn't do very well, my dad had to get a dish washer to help her with it.) and cleans the clothes.   -Constantly losing other family member's clothes.      I've tried telling my dad to get her professional help but he never has and refuses too, saying she is just a fragile person.      Does my mom have a disease or is she just plain unintelligent? (She did graduate high school, so I don't know, but she tried to commit suicide via overdosing when she was 19 years old, I think that may have screwed something up in her brain.)

I have had 4 kids and approaching menopause. I started running again just over 3 weeks ago, and lost 5 kg plus I have been eating better too. at my heaviest weight one month ago and a bit longer I was a grouse 70 kilos that would be about 152 pounds. Now I weight between 65-66kg which I think is about 140-142 pounds. Now do you all think by the middle of the year of aiming to be 60kg which would be about 130 pounds will be too small? that would make me about a size 10 Australian which is about a 6 in the US. so do you think that is too low for my age? When I was in my twenties I was naturally 110 pounds and in my early thirties I was the same weight even after 4 kids. and now that I am 40 over the last 4 years I had been lazy eating all kinds of junk and no exercise. Plus the medication I am on does not help. so anyway by the middle of the year do you think 130 pounds for me is good?

I've had to give up all of those things.  It got to a point that it just hurt to much to be enjoyable.     I guess my question is this:  Am I the only one like this?  Any help is greatly appreciated.

20090305005437AADcZDT	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Ocular Migraine with severe pain?	This evening, after running 6 miles I took a shower.  After the shower I was feeling a little light headed, but I was about to make dinner so I assumed I was just hungry and continued into the kitchen.        After about 5 minutes, I had to stop chopping vegetables because I couldn't see what I was chopping.  My vision was suddenly getting worse and worse.  I started to see these little tan shiney things in my vision, and felt my heart race a little bit.  I decided I might have low blood sugar, and drank half a cup of apple juice and laid down.  30 minutes later, I was still seeing spots and not getting any better.      I called my doctor who didn't seem to worried and told me I was probably just having Ocular Migraines.      From what I am reading about ocular migraines, they seem to not cause pain.  I felt like my head was going through a meat grinder..  It was horrible.      Has anyone had any similar experiences?  Aside from sitting in a dark room, is there anything you can do for them?  It's been hours, and despite taking some motrin I am still in pain.  I plan to call my doctor in the morning, but if anyone has advice until then I'd appreciate it.      Thanks.      Oh, and I should mention I am a 23 year old female who is in otherwise good health.

I wanted the opinion of someone who knew ... if the workout I had planned was a good one, or if there was something you would change. I figured I would run/walk a mile then jump rope for about 20 - 30 min (with breaks) to get my heart rate up and then maybe do push ups, sit ups etc... totaling to about an hour workout (I heard that was a good time) would this be a good program to do along with better eating habits (keeping my calories down to about 1200 a day). I am 24 years old 5'9 and 280 Lbs my goal weight is 180 right now.

So, here is the scoop - my last period was Jan. 15th (I am never regular and always have about a 35-40 days cycle). Around Feb. 5th, I was spotting heavily for about 4-5 days (never had this before) and since havent had my my period. Today is March 4th and still nada. My breasts are SUPER sore, I am eating tons, getting up at night 2-3 times to pee, etc. All signs of being pregnant...but all the tests are negative.

20090305004804AAWDPo1	Health;Other - Health	Grains of something on my scalp?	For a few years now, when I run my hands through my hair, I can sometimes find little white granules on my scalp.  It's almost like I've been at the beach and didn't shake out all the sand, only I haven't been to a beach.  It doesn't itch and there are no signs of anything on my scalp except that I find them when I look for them.  At most, there will be 20.  If I find them all, it's another week or two before they reappear.        I have taken one and looked at it with my sons toy eyeclopse and magnified 2000 times I can see that's they are solid white, hard granules (nothing that is or was ever alive).  I am 38 years old, dye my roots bi-weekly and use different shampoos all the time.  Any ideas?  I've googled and didn't find anything.

20090305010655AAGIStL	Health;Women's Health	Can anyone recommend an alternative to tampons?	I have asked a similar question previously but I didn't really get an answer I was looking for.      Has anybody used anything other than tampons - I was looking into getting a mooncup but the only testimonies I can find seem to be on the manufacturers website and I don't always trust them 100% as they may not be genuine testimonies (I know that they aren't allowed to put made up ones on, but some people in this world lie).      I have problems with tampons as they tend to slip and I have that uncomfortable feeling and I have to go and adjust it, or they leak because I'm so heavy and then when I get lighter they tend to dry me out and are painful to remove - I never used to have this problem with them and I don't know why it has started but I am just sick of using them.      I don't have 100% confidence in using just pads alone as they tend to leak when I have a heavy one so at the moment I use both.      I have previously been on the pill (combined and mini), injection and the implant but the doctor took me off them all as they just didn't agree with me and I ended up having 6-7 week periods on them all so going to my GP for the pill to make it lighter isn't really an option and I don't want a coil fitted as my partner and I are hoping to be trying for a baby soon.

Before I begin I would like to make it clear that I have never and will never support or endorse child pornography. Trust me, I hate nothing more then a pedophile.

I have never, ever, ever been aroused in anyway by child before, in fact thanks to my OCD I avoid them at all costs. But lately I can't help but think about them sometimes.      I have never looked at child porn or anything of that nature, I keep it all inside my head, and even there it is never a sexual fantasy, it is just the image or thought of a younger girl. I honestly do not know why this happens and I feel sick every time.      Any advice or suggestions would be very much appreciated. Once again, I am sorry if this offended anyone.

Lately I a lot of weird things have been happening to me but I'm most confused about the.... visions i've been having.      I saw myself get shot in the stomach under a street light, i fell and saw a blur run toward me before it all faded black.       In another vision I saw my friends veins flash black and fade back to normal on his left cheek, I stroked his cheek down to his bottom chapped lip and told him they had tasted death. At the time of this vision, I could smell "death". My whole body went numb, and it smelled like a thick odorless smoke with the faint smell of cigarettes almost choking me. I was getting really hot and red in the face and tearing up.      I have also been having conversations with the people inside my head on paper.... and i can't stop writing but these people are not me. I thought it was Split Personality but maybe not.       I don't know if I am mentally sick, gifted, crazy, or just overreacting.

She says she has changed nothing in her diet, and she has even changed body wash and deoderent.      I feel awful I cant help her because she is very upset about this considering she is still in high school and is around people all day.      She says the odor is almost instant, after she showers, she starts to smell in 10 minutes or sometimes less.      Im baffled by this because she said she even took a scrub bath and when she was still in the tub, she started to smell.      ANY HELP???   FYI: She is on Loestrin Birth Control and recently had her adderall XR dosage upped to 30MG as opposed to the 25MG she was taking before. I wasnt sure if these details would make a difference.      Please Help!   Thanks in advance!

20090305030812AAVcYDL	Health;Other - Health	Can someone please give me some advice?	I am living in the UK and I need some advice about what to do about my current health situation.       I have been ill for over a year now with stomach/digestive problems. I was told I had H pylori and that was treated but I was never re-tested for it.    My stomach problems remained after treatment and I was given various medications including lansoprazole and domperidone after the triple therapy for the h pylori seemed to fail.    My pain started as sharp pains that felt like really extreme hunger pains and got worse when i ate. I was also getting some bad lower ab discomfort which they put down to IBS but I am not 100% convinced it's that. Since taking the domperidone the stomach pains that were sharp seemed to clear up but I am still getting lower discomfort. I was given blood tests and i tested positive on one thing for coeliac disease but the other thing they look for was negative so she pretty much dismissed that idea. The doctor did more blood tests but she seemed pretty much stumped and asked "so how much is this actually bothering you then?" and "what would you like me to do now?" If it wasn't bothering me a great deal I wouldn't have visited the doctor 10 times since september and paid for 9 different prescriptions!    Also last night i got a really bad pain in my stomach that is worse than ever. I hurt so much I couldn't take deep breaths. It's still a little sore this morning and hurting occasionally but I just don't understand what it is. I am completely lost and don't know what to do. My doctor doesn't seem to be doing much to try and find out the cause except take blood samples and i've seen 7 or 8 different doctors about it so far because at my surgery you rarely get the same doctor unless you are willing to wait a while for appointments. Has anyone got any helpful advice on what I can do next because i feel like my doctor is giving up or even any ideas on what my illness could be due to past experience etc?      My symtoms are:   Lower ab discomfort, feels kinda sore   Sharp stabbing stomach pains (recentl started again after a few weeks break)   Loss of appetite   Irregular periods   Some days frequent use of the toilet but not diarrhea   Bloating   A horrible bile-like taste in the back of my throat

Alright, so I decided I was going to start just doing push ups every night, not really to get in shape super fast, but hopefully just to get my started, and keep adding other things later on, just right now to get into a routine. But anyways, on to the question. I read somewhere, where it was like...do 10 your first night and build up. Lol. But I did 30, thinking I'm not that bad in shape. I am not sore whatsoever. Should I just keep building up each day, and then once I figure out where I'm starting to sore, take rest days?  Or is it fine to just do it every night. And what would be "better," 100 push ups in sets of 20. Or..something just straight without stopping.

I see the dentist every 6 months and brush 2-3 times a day, after each meal. I am also an avid gum chewer (Not creepy like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate factory, but I chew gum when I drive and when I am out and about running errands.  It is always Orbit gum or Trident).  This morning I woke up to my gums feeling swollen, though you cannot tell just by looking at them. They are also a bit redder than normal and slightly painful. I don't understand?! What is going on? I just saw my dentist 2 months ago and got a perfect bill of health.       In some research I found that a home remedy is to dip your already pasted toothbrush into baking soda/powder.  Has anyone tried this? should I try before going back to see if t helps? Does it alleviate the pain?  The pain is not BAD bad, but it gets my attention.

As these skincells are shed, the color fades. The lotion we want to make just darkens the color of the skin without the use of any chemicals.

20090305032436AAUe9Uk	Health;Mental Health	Anyone Know About Seizures?	My neighbor just died last night. We came home, and there was a medical examiner outside his house. It turns out that he had a really severe seizure disorder, and what happened was, he was in the shower, and had a seizure but nobody was home, so he drowned. His wife came home and found him in the tub, but it was already to late.      I was wondering what state of mind someone is in when they are having a seizure. Are you completely out of it, like passing out? Or are you conscious about what is happening? Most seizures I have seen, the person's eyes are open, but does this necessarily mean they are conscious?      It has just really been bothering me, because I can't even imagine what it would be like to be completely conscious and aware of what was happening in a situation like that, but have absolutely no ability to do anything about it. It's horrible.      So if you are familiar with seizures, please let me know.      Thank you.

(this is the most important thing that's bothering me..) i can get extremely wet but i don't really feel the 'good feeling'. masterbating works but...whew.. what is wrong with me!!!

The thing is, theis problem has made me feel sick to my stomach, and I feel that it is destroying my mind and body, and I will be like this forever. I really do feel I'm digging my own grave with this.          I used to masturbate when I was around 8 years of age, or it could have been earlier. Sicne then, I had developed a weird dreamty state, where I would feel uncomforatble with my mind, and how i see things. I feel soooo soooo unreal and frightened and uncomforatble, sometimes I get this cold sensation in my head, I feel as if I'm diseased. I don't know why... I get over exicted at things, and then I would deny my existence, thinking that I am niot normal, and that something is seriously wrogn with me. My mind would feel toooo relaxed and uncomfortable. I jsut feel unreal and lethargic all the time... I feel TOOO clear and this has caused me to feel weird..      my heart is always pounding, And I always have  mucus in my throat, and I feel as if I have a fever everyday...

20070521202144AAdE3Tr	Health;Women's Health	BV (Bacterial Vaginosis) should I just live with it?	I've had BV for almost two months. I just ended a week-long treatment with antibiotics. It went away after about 4 days but just came right back after the treatment stopped. Seeing the discharge is weird, but on the whole it's not a very uncomfortable condition. I've had the same partner the whole time I've had bv- it started up right after we became sexually active. It hasn't really gotten in the way of a good sex life, and I don't notice any odor. I experience slight itching, but it's not really bothersome. Seeing the discharge is weird because it's an alert that the condition is still present, but I could learn to ignore that. Should I just pretend this never happened? Will I face serious health risks if I just let the BV be?
