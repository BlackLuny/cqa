The first ones coloring is really neat though.|`|gwUMipsUaa	It doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  But each owner thinks their dogs look the best.|`|qze3pQ3laa	i think stella is cuter. i love her coloring. she would look even cuter if the picture was a little better and showed more of her.|`|P4CADDPdaa	I think they are both equally cute, but Stella catches my eye the most!|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	Stella|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	NEITHER!  Why do you care what people think about your dogs?
0m6BgESXaa	The point was, at the time the breed was developed, to prevent their tails from being grabbed by assailants or getting caught in wheels of the carts they pulled.<br>  <br>  Now it's for tradition and aesthetic reasons, but since it is done at such a young age (1-3 days) they feel little to no pain (undeveloped nerve endings).|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Possibly for show quality or just because that's how the breed has always looked. I think its cruel and pointless. I have seen some Rotties with tails and I think they are adorable. Why put a dog through pain that is unnessesary?|`|8dhe15MUaa	these people want there tails docking|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Some of the other posts are right - it is historical, related to the original purpose of the breed, also to create a particular look.  These days it is part of the breed standard and what most people expect a Rottie to look like.<br>  <br>  It is now illegal in many places.  Still legal in the USA/Canada/NZ and probably a few other places I don't know about :-)<br>  <br>  I breed Boxers so have a lot of experience of tail docking and the situation is pretty much the same.<br>  <br>  I have docked a lot of puppies myself and seen plenty of other puppies docked by other breeders and by vets.  Done well, docking is not cruel.  Removing dew claws causes my pups more discomfort. (Note that farmers do far worse things to sheep and cattle).<br>  <br>  Why do we do it (in countries where it's still legal)?  Well, in my case it's because 99% of the other dogs of the breed are docked and most people don't accept tails so I would find it harder to find good homes for my pups, and because to show my dogs I need to follow the breed standard which specifies 'docked tail'.  Given that the procedure I use is not cruel, I will continue to dock until the law changes.<br>  <br>  Some people claim it prevents injury, and avoids problems with tails knocking people or objects around the house.  I don't agree with those arguments personally.<br>  <br>  I think most breeders are removing a healthy limb due to 'fashion' and a very small risk of injury or inconvenience.<br>  <br>  I'm just being honest with you here.  I know other breeders have very different opinions!|`|PM23RDycaa	Breed standard and personally having seen one with a tail I prefer without.<br>  <br>  The Rott was developed as a working dog and like many working breeds the tail is docked for its own protection. In this case the Rott was bred to be a herder for the livestock of Roman armies as they went to war and many people still use them to work cattle today.<br>  <br>  Then it became a police/guard dog.<br>  <br>  Docking dose serve a purpose though people don't like to admit it or acknowledge it. Its also done a few days after birth and the puppy doesn't even remember what has happened by the time they are on their way home from the vet.|`|9kTejB0uaa	I have to say that, in my eyes, Rotties with tails look ridiculous.  Until breeders sort out what their full tails are meant to look like (which is going to take time) this will continue.  They were docked for the same reason all former (in the UK) docked breeds were docked, working breeds.  Also an adult tail injury is horrendous.  It's a sad fact that in the past, before it was banned in the UK, sometimes puppies were not docked by experienced people, with dire consequences.  So it was made illegal.  But I still regret that docking is banned in the UK.|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	It is about time they started to nick a few persons that dock dogs tails.<br>  Some of the answers on here want to get it right? There is no reason what so ever, to dock a dogs tail.|`|UdIiqllEaa	Most people do it just for image purposes! I persoanlly think its cruel.<br>  <br>  It's the same with some dogs and their ears, mainly dobermans and boxers get their ears cut, etc just so they look more aggressive!!!!<br>  <br>  I used to have a rottie once and he had his tail and looked better with a tail than without. Some people dont realise how important a dogs tail really is:<br>  1) Used to express emotion / behaviour<br>  2) Used for balance<br>  3) Used to keep fly's away from the back end<br>  4) In artic breed (i.e. Siberian Husky) the tail is also used to help keep them warm in cold weather.<br>  <br>  Its illegal to dock tail in the UK where I am, but people here can still import from other countries where it isn't illegal and get a docked tail that way.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	Becuase that is how the breed is suppose to look. <br>  <br>  It's for the same reason people crop ears and dock other breeds tails.|`|593d4ca33380f9551422fae1a382cbb3aa	Dont know i think its cruel to do that to dogs, if they weren't meant to have tails they wouldn't of been born with them. Think its illegal here now at last!|`|vwC7klVVaa	Thank god it is now illegal to dock dog tail in England now but they used to be done for looks. But they look so much better with there tails.|`|40EotGSlaa	Theyy only do it for fashion mean or what? :/|`|9d406181bdeb25a91963a07e78cda253aa	Mostly for showing,,,,,I think it's pointless too|`|ufdFei1jaa	Wheres my tail???|`|PshRhxqraa	It is cruel and also illegal here in the UK:<br>  <br>  <br>  All UK legislation has now been passed and enacted as follows;<br>  <br>  The docking of dogs' tails was banned in England from 6 April 2007 and in Wales from 28 March 2007 but with exemptions from the ban for certain working dogs, and for medical treatment. A total ban in Scotland took effect 30 April 2007|`|nFiTpDAeaa	It became a breed standard. So rottweilers could not become injured. Some countries have now implemented laws against docking tails and therefore their breed standards have also changed so no docked tails are accepted.
Wrbpc5NTaa	If you visit every weekend, they will remember you, and will probably still be affectionate towards you (and of course, still love you!).

e7773rspaa	If you are worried about removing uneaten food, the best way to do that without a water change is using a turkey baster.<br>  I doubt a small water change would stress her too much, provided you used dechlor and kept the temp the same.|`|tShDXmgbaa	you can do a water change and your yellow lab should do fine.  Only a tiny bit of flake should be added the tank and this should only be done every other day since most females will only take in a tiny bit of food every once in a while (not everyday) if at all. She will be getting ready to spit her fry in the next couple of weeks. Congrats!|`|9kceDOTraa	Is the female the only fish in the tank?  Basically, did you isolate her or is she still in the community tank?  At 15 days, assuming you actually saw the spawn, the fry are already at a wiggler stage and she could let them out to free swim and gather food at any point.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though, you do not need to put food in, since a mouth brooder doesn't eat in almost every case when holding and the fry get their food from the egg sac as well.  If you need to do a water change, this should not pose a problem, but keep a look out in case there are a few fry that have gotten out, and she has not collected them back up.
B6zl0AJDaa	Thanks Greg for pointing this out to me.<br>  <br>  I have a 1975 2 horse straight load King.  I bought it brand new in Sept. of 1975.  The reason you don't see a LOT of them for sale is that they are nolonger made but those who have them VERY RARELY sell them.<br>  <br>  They are tough, take a LOT of abuse and mine's what, 34 years old nearly and STILL road worthy!<br>  <br>  BTW it does weigh more than 800 LBS  I'd have to go outside and check the specs on the original mfgr's plate, but I'm thinkin' that's it's more like 2100 LBS and 800 maybe the tongue weight.<br>  <br>  I bought it for my then 5 yr old AQHA gelding at Horsetrailers International in Encino, CA.  He got the NEW trailer, I got the 3 yr old truck.  Tells ya who rates in this family, huh?  HeHeHe<br>  <br>  They used to charge MORE per weight when registering the trailers...  I had a friend who stripped her's down to bare bones then weighed it!  LOL  <br>  <br>  Later:  ALWAYS tape off the mfgr's information when you have your trailer repainted...Grrrrr    Anyway, King was manufactured by the Cimmaron Mfgr Company, Tulsa, OK.<br>  <br>  I just looked at the original pink on mine, my memory's still pretty good for an old gal.  Unladen weight:  2,100 LBS.  I don't see a tongue wgt.  though, but betcha that's the 800 LBS!|`|RloOJ43haa	I think that's the kind Rosie has. I will ask her to come answer.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I owned a King back in the 70's. Think it was a 1974.  I liked it!!  Very nice, sturdy trailer.  Can't say I agree with the weight of the trailer...Trailers back then, like cars, used a heavier steel.  I would re check the weight.  Anyhow, as long as the floor is good and you have good tires, you should be ok.  Check for rust underneath and make sure the leaf springs are good.. see that the band that holds the leafs together is not broke or rusted.  I would check the whole thing for rust, the tongue, axles, under the floor, body  etc. Make sure the bearings are all ok, that kind of stuff.  If that seems ok, then the trailer is probably ok.  If you have a horse trailer dealer around there, they may look it over for you (expect to pay a fee.. they may or may not). If it does not pass inspection she pays, if it does, you pay.|`|AA10726599	As long as the floor is sturdy,look under mats if they are in place. The tires should be good and check the tongue for rust. Have them haul a horse to show you how it rides(drive behind them, beside them and listen for bearing/brake noises). Good luck|`|penuzN8jaa	my friend life gordon f2 home yes back light<br>  x|`|lgaztlh8aa	2 Large horses? I would think if the horses weigh more than the trailer.....rethink maybe? Also, 5.5 feet wide, that would equal a little over 2.5 feet wide per stall. It sounds really small.<br>  <br>  Most trailers from that time frame are considered Quarter Horse trailers and they are really too small for anything over a Medium pony.<br>  <br>  A horse trailer is an important investment and not the place you want to skimp with your equine budget. Their lives depend on your sound judgement.<br>  <br>  JMHO!
vS1Z0inOaa	You can sometimes feel for eggs in a turtles hips, but most of the time it's impossible to tel they're pregnant without an X-ray. She'll want a box of dirt at least 6 inches deep to lay her eggs in. Most of the time if they're infertile though, they'll just drop them on the basking platform or in the water. If your RES has access to a male and you want the babies, you'll need to put the eggs into an incubator. Otherwise just destroy them. Make sure your RES has access to a cuttlebone, plenty of greens and whole feeder fish to make sure she's getting enough calcium and vitamin A. Females need an increased amount of these things when they're developing eggs even if they're infertile ones.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Take her hind leg and pull it out a bit, the place between her shell and foot (hot foot and tail), feel inside there gently and you should feel small eggs inside her.<br>  Check both legs.<br>  If you're still unsure or don't want to hurt her, take her to the doctor.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/state_resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  That's a list of vets, who specialize in exotic animals, in each state.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|np8IuMqqaa	<a href="http://getinthis.cstrainingmotors6.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinthis.cstrainingmotors6.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|Rj9DBmg8aa	Well...actually they look like any female RES!

When I first started reading your description a feist is the dog I thought of first then reading further down I saw it was one you are considering.<br>  <br>  Yes feists are a breed just not AKC & more of a hunting dog used regionally.

OBci1DxQaa	I wouldn't worry too much about vet costs.  Yes, you need to have an emergency fund in case something DOES happen, but in 18 years of keeping chinchillas I've only had to go to the veterinarian once.<br>  <br>  I find that after buying the animal and cage, they're actually rather inexpensive.<br>  <br>  If you give your chinchilla a lot of attention you don't need two.  A chinchilla needs a buddy, but you can fill that role!  If a chin was spending a lot of time alone I would recommend a second, but you certainly don't have to.|`|PeNT1RzBaa	If you are going to get two, its best to get them together as they will have formed some kind of bond already.

So long as you are willing to commit a couple hours of attention to it every day and make sure its got planty of stuff to keep busy while you are away during they day,  one chinchilla can be just fine on its own.  <br>  If you get them from rescue shelters, they can be a little less expensive, like $80ish, but they also have some baggage attached to them and require extra care and love like mine does.  In a pet store, expect to pay $150-$200 per.|`|0mb78CiWaa	One chinchilla should be fine.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Let me tell you a horror story. A while ago I had a friend who had a chinchilla who chewed its own leg off, and then started chewing on the stump...obviously that was one very disturbed chinchilla but if your chinchilla hurts itself it is not uncommon to break limbs or have other problems. Treatment on this guy cost over $600.<br>  <br>  So, if you cant afford to buy two chinchillas, how are you going to afford the vets bills if something drastic happens to your chinchilla? It might not happen year into the future, it might happen tomorrow, or in a few weeks.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, it is fairer for the chinchillas to have company. It can be hard to introduce them ,but if you get two from the same litter you'll be fine, and they do appreciate company, its unfair to keep them alone unless you are absolutely incapable of keeping two together because of fighting.<br>  <br>  But in short, if you can afford the vet you cant afford the pet!

YQfEOeStaa	The average price for a boxer:<br>  <br>  * from a breeder - $500-1000<br>  * from a pet store - $800-1200<br>  * from a shelter - $350<br>  * from a rescue organization - $250<br>  <br>  I would suggest you go to www.petfinder.com and search for what you are looking for. You can search by your geographic area, then by breed, then by age (go with puppy) and then see what is available.<br>  <br>  I do volunteer work for the Minnesota Boxer Rescue (www.mnboxerrescue.org) and many times we rescue a boxer who is going to have a litter of puppies, so we have to find homes for the puppies as well. All the dogs are in foster homes, loving, caring people teach, train and take care of them, so they are well adapted and being on their way to making great pets when they find their forever home.<br>  <br>  I am partial to boxers. I have 2 (one brindle, one fawn). They are wonderful pets. You are making a wise choice in getting a boxer! But please consider petfinder -- many rescue organizations will have what you are looking for. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Rebecca|`|2f4oghxOaa	I have had a lot of dogs and the mongrels would be around $150 and from a breeder a purebred  boxer would be around $500 im am not to sure how much it would be from a pet store but if you do get a puppy then make sure it has had its 8 week old injections, you can see it with the mother! (very important!) and if the say its kennel Club registered ask to see<br>   the papers!   you can also go on petfinder.co.uk to find the perfect one!  hope this helped!|`|f74QBClmaa	Breeder: $350--$450 or more<br>  <br>  Pet Store:  $500 and up (they always charge way to much)<br>  <br>  Shelter: $12.00--$200 (depends on the shelter and you need to buy the license)<br>  <br>  Do your research before buying from any breeder or pet store. You don't want one coming from a nasy puppy mill.|`|009xnsB1aa	I have 3 Purebred boxers.<br>  <br>  A 11 month old and two 9 week old's.<br>  <br>  My 11 month old boxer came from a top of the line breeder that breeds boxers for sporting events so he is real muscular and a very good looking boxer he cost $700 (AKC Reg)<br>  <br>  And then i just bought 2 more boxer puppies (9 weeks) about a week  ago but i didnt get them from the same breeder for the girl a payed 400 and then my boy i paid 300 both AKC Reg..<br>  <br>  So to answer your question you will pay from a breeder anywhere from 200-1000  have seen 100-150 like in the news paper like a accident litter  but there usally not registered at that price just pure bred.But make sure they are pure bred.<br>  <br>  I dont know what state you live in but alot of states have boxer rescue groups where they only take in full bred boxers you would be surprised how many good look pure bred boxer and boxer puppies are in them..<br>  <br>  But hope i helped boxers are the best breed defiantly get one ;)|`|O4jGlC2caa	Breeder:<br>  Anywhere from $200 to over $1000<br>  Price doesn't reflect quality though.  If you are going to pay $1000+, it better be AKC registered AND have champion titled parents.  The farther over $1000, the more they need to prove they looked into genetic testing for defects too.  An AKC from a poor breeder should not surpass $500.<br>  <br>  Pet store:<br>  Oh, they'll charge you over $1000 for a dog you could've gotten from a bad breeder for less than $500.  If the dog isn't from a puppy mill, it was the last of the litter that the breeder couldn't sell.<br>  <br>  Shelter:<br>  I wouldn't pay more than $150... maybe $200... for an up-to-date vaccinated and spayed/neutered Boxer.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	I have a 16 month old male fawn Boxer who I got from a Breeder. I did alot of research on pricing and that too. I live in Ontario Canada and I paid $1200 for my guy. I seen some at a pet store and they wanted $2500. I am not sure about a rescue place or shelter.|`|ry9Eu92baa	Average price is usually $500-$600. Although I've seen them higher in price. I paid $500 for mine, and she is AKC registered, and had her first set of shots.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Hi<br>  <br>  The prices people are quoting you are not a lot of use to you as the actual price will depend on where you live (as you can see from the answers, some people are even in different countries to you!).<br>  <br>  What you can see from the answers is that a pet shop is most expensive, then breeder, then rescue/shelter.  That should be true pretty much anywhere.<br>  <br>  Boxers can be prone to a variety of hereditary diseases so it is important that you go to a good breeder who does the right tests (I give some websites with info on health testing in Sources below) .  Most pet shops will not have copies of health test results for parents, grand parents etc.  <br>  <br>  Anyone breeding boxers needs to be doing health testing.  If they're not, run a mile!
3arJsZ91aa	Are you certain the blood isn't coming from his urine?  If he has a litter tray, try and check it out.  My female cat tried to tell me that she had a urine infection by trying to pee in the bath (something that she had never done before).  She was trying to see if the cold and damp would ease the pain of trying to go.  Take your cat for a check up if you have searched through his fur for any scabs and can't find anything, also check his mouth if you can in case he has damaged his mouth in some way.|`|AA11639619	Fleas or mites.|`|631d898eda9d1327e73c3f692a061adcaa	It's probably fleas|`|ttT7W77gaa	could be flea bites,arsenal 4ever|`|x0WZE0i4aa	OK, I have an idea... may be wrong, but worth a try!  Try giving your cat a comb and rub any fur that comes off over a piece of white paper.  If you get little black specks, try wetting them and smearing them over the paper.<br>  <br>  If this gives your red streaks, I'm afraid your cat has fleas.  The black specks are actually the flea's poo: digested blood (I'm thinking if your sink is wet, they are dissolving in there...). If so, don't panic, they can be treated!  And most cats get them at some point. Perhaps post another question for tips *G*  But do treat: if your cat doesn't get treated he could end up with major skin problems for real, or even anemia (not to mention they'll start biting your and your guests...)<br>  <br>  If not, and no-one else has any ideas, I guess you should visit the vet.  If your cat does have fleas then no need to worry about him liking tap water: many cats do.  I'd stop him though if he's actually drinking water that is dirty/soapy.<br>  <br>  PS: after reading your addition, I still say do the flea test!  They can be difficult to actually see... and it only takes one pregnant female, even picked up by you from outside somewhere, to start an infestation.  If he's only 6 months, there might even have been fleas/eggs on him when he arrived.  If it's negative, I think it's vet time.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	this is something you should be asking your vet.
enC9TvxUaa	-Why do they need to leave their natural habitat?  You could try shooing them yourself, hanging shiny objects, like old CD's form a string, or even playing loud music out there.  BUT, sorry to say, they were here forst- you are in their migratory path and they are just looking for food/shelter.  Why not enjoy them?  I would LOVE to have the opportunity you have.  Yes, I know you have to clean the poop, but the rain will do that most of the time!|`|2rXWZkbnaa	Take matters into your own hands. Buy a gun and shoot the damn things.

Remember they will not attack unless they feel threatened.|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	You can get a dog, but then you risk actually hurting the birds... and then you have a dog to care for.<br>  <br>  The store I used to work at sold geese decoys that looked very lifelike. However, the one thing people used to tell me when they'd come back to buy more was that they loved them because they kept the real ones AWAY.<br>  <br>  Granted, it's not doing a very good job as a decoy- but most of those people kept coming back to get more because it was effectively keeping their yards free of duck and goose poop. <br>  <br>  A scarecrow of some kind could also help.|`|yMbw0Osnaa	make some cut outs of predatory birds from your area such as hawks and eagles and hang them where you want the ducks to leave|`|AA11336203	BUY A LABRADOR RETRIEVER...THEY LOVE DUCKS AND GEESE..(TO CHASE)

It looks like they are starting to fill.  Some mares don't get a full udder til just when they foal.  If you have dripping and that "wax droplet" look, the she is within days of foaling( or up to 2 weeks..lol).  You may or may not get the wax and if you do it may fall off and not happen again.  Watch for the yellow crystal-like droplet that are sticking or oozing, this is the colostrum, then she IS close!!|`|AA11036952	well she doesnt have a big elder.  but alot of mares dont, yes that is the wax.  just check her tonight but maybe 2morrow there should be a bit of mile dripping might only be a little even might only be one.  she could foal in aday or a week.  this is the foaling process check every night.  they can foal with the wax but usually milk will follow could come 2morrow or next day.  goodluck and keep us updated oh and photos.  feel free to email me.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Looks like she is ready to go at any time.

f1SWISQYaa	Cats love food, some cats will eat non-stop if you let him. Just give him 1/3 of a cup three times a day, so that way he has energy. Dont feed him to much because he will be lazy and sleep most of the time. Keep him as an indoor cat, because if you let him out, he will always want to go out, as long as you have lots of toys inside (or maybe another cat for friends) he will be happier and heather and also you dont have to worry about him getting hit by a car or other bad things :)|`|lPgwZzoWaa	Did the vet worm him or did you use over the counter wormer?  Over the counter wormer is worthless!  I finally took mine to the vet and she gave me some Revolution drops (non-greasy drop that go on the back of the neck) and the worms (and ear mites I had also been trying to treat) FINALLY went away.  In like three days she was fine!!!|`|2JIkzC1baa	is that cat a inside cat or outside maybe it needs a fresh air staying in a crowded place all the time........................GO TO THE DOCTOR make sure  its healtly|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	what food are you feeding your cat if it is crap food then yes your cat will need more to eat to get full.<br>  <br>  what did the vet say about the deworming when you took the cat in the second time to be dewormed?  did they check a fecal sample to make sure they were treating the proper type of worms?  what did the vet say about the always feeling hungry?  did they do an abdominal xray yet. if not you may want to suggest that to them.<br>  <br>  that is very good that he hasn't been let outside, keep that up.  nothing good will come from a cat being outside.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Your kitty is still growing. He probably won't be full grown until around a year old. He needs extra food for a growing body.<br>  <br>  Why not keep him as an inside only kitty? He'd more than likely live longer.
Jkap3Aa5aa	10 in 60 L, doesn't sound like they'll be competing for space. You say they no longer school, this means your fish are relaxed, they only school as a defence mechanism against larger predators etc. I used to have 11 neons and they only schooled once, the day I brought them home from the shop and never did again. So if your fish are relaxed and have space, then I'd say competing to mate or for food. If your fish is the biggest, it may well be managing to get more than it's fair share of the food with these tactics.|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	This is what my fish are like [[I think]]!<br>  I think they might be food aggressive!<br>  Have you noticed the aggressiveness when food's around?<br>  I don't think you can do anything though! :(<br>  Sorry!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

I did it with guppies and other fish. Catch the aggressive fish in a net. Take the net to the top of the water (make sure the fish can swim fine!) and let the net sit there for 15 mins. It helped me. Hope I helped!

I hope she comes back soon.|`|IPMr6zEJaa	Assuming she does not have a collar, have you put up any missing cat fliers? Indoor cats can become very curious, and try to leave the house every chance they get. They don't know what is out there, and being kept away from doors will make her wonder what is beyond them.<br>  Try knocking on neighbors doors and asking if they have seen her, and if no one has, ask them to help you put up fliers within a 2 mile radius. Leave food outside where it's easily accesable by her, and check every now and then to see if she has come by. Call your local shelters and describe your kitten to them. They might ask you to come by.<br>  <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope you find your kitten, I know I'd be lost without mine.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  Have you sent out fliers with her face?  Cat are explorer, and will do this at least 2-3 blocks from home. So I suggest you go around, and ask your neighbor to look around, especially in their garage and crawl space.  Leave food out, and see if you notice if she comes around to eat.  <br>  <br>  Other point, since she is still a young cat, people are bad in keeping them.  On the fliers, address there is a reward money. That kind of give people the tempting to return your baby. <br>  Also immediately notify your local animal control, and they will ask you to come by daily.  Animal shelter have a week hold, if I am not wrong, before they are put up for adoption. <br>  <br>  Once they are found, invest in getting them micro chip.
ta3wiCvtaa	The bubbles are compressed nitrogen from cold water and from water being compressed in pipes. They stop forming after about 24 hours of the water sitting out. They ARE dangerous to fish and it's not air. The bubbles can form inside of the betta and cause something called gas bubble disease which can kill them. Let your water sit out in a bucket for a day before you change the water and it will be fine. The bubbles will simply wipe off of everything after they're done forming. <br>  Also make sure your tank is heated if you're getting a betta. They're tropical fish and need water between 78-80 degrees.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	thats normal,they will go away in a day or so,they are only dangerous to a fish when they get stuck on the fish and wont come off and can cause skin damage,but they should be gone before you put a fish in there cause if its brand new you have to cycle it first....|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	It's air.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Nothing to worry about. The bubbles are just air coming out of the water. They will not hurt any fish. They will be reabsorbed back into the water after a while.|`|gQongGHUaa	they will go away if you just let them.  its just a two gallon, reach in there and blow um off with ur hand.<br>  these are common in new tanks
S5Lz35myaa	When you take him outside to go potty, always be on leash, and always walk to the same area of the yard.  Do not allow him to leave this area until he goes, and then a lot of praise and the occasional cookie.  The trick is consistency - and make sure to stay with him in this area until he goes.
L22hVXTIaa	First, you should not be giving your dog any kind of medication without knowing what's wrong with him!  Second, internal parasites would not make a dog hyper, in fact, it can make them quite ill.  If, however, you are talking about fleas, ticks, mites, etc. - then "yes' it could cause the scratching etc.  But if your vet said he was free of fleas, ticks etc. I would recommend that you take him back to the vet for an exam and explain to the vet how he's acting.  If he's crying and growling, there must be something wrong.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Zanax can make a chimp flip out and tear your hands off|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	I does sound as if he ate something he was allergic to - even if they go out and find someone else's poop to snack on, it can have food allergens in it such as corn and chicken.  That is enough for some dogs to have a wind-up session.  If there are others in the household, they could have dropped a bit of food as well - it only takes a few chips or who knows what to cause a reaction, but it doesn't last long. This is the sort of thing that can happen uring school vacations and holidays.<br>  <br>    As long as it was only temporary, I wouldn't worry too much about it.|`|qwD45UBJaa	What did you give him? When my dog was treated for giardia, the vet suggested panacur. Panacur, a.k.a. doggie crack, makes my dog absolutely crazy insane. He will run around, won't sleep for 8+ hours, and basically do all sorts of high energy things that he normally doesn't do. I have a friend that had the exact same reaction to Panacur with multiple different dogs.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Just because he didn't have any fleas a week ago doesn't necessarily mean he hasn't got them now ...  <br>  <br>  He could be having an allergic reaction to something.  Your best bet is to go back to the Vet and tell them what's happening!
5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	poor kitty, there is pleanty you can do at home to let your kid and your cat live with you.  <br>  <br>  don't allow the cat in the kids bedroom and one other room.<br>  <br>  get some air purifiers make sure to have one in the kids room, and some other ones scattered around the house<br>  <br>  vaccuum a few times a week<br>  <br>  have your fiance brush the cat at least once a week and throw out the hair right away<br>  <br>  once or twice a day get some cat wipes and wipe down the cat this will get the saliva off of the cat is what most likely what your kid is allergic to.<br>  <br>  please don't get rid of this cat|`|0mb78CiWaa	You can put an ad in the paper. You can also see if any of your friends,family members, etc want a cat.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	With a cat that old, I would say keep it.  Either delay moving in together or have your child take allergy medicine while keeping the cat separated from her (possibly on another level of the house altogether?).  Also, most people who are allergic are allergic to the dander (dried saliva on the fur after they've cleaned themselves) and not the fur.  There are wipes you can use daily on the cat to keep down on the dander and help with your child's allergies.   Trying to re-home a cat of that age will be next to impossible and if your fiance has had it for the entire 13 years of its life, think of how traumatizing that would be for the cat.  If you absolutely must get rid of the cat, contact a cat rescue in your area. Do not give it to someone who answers an ad, and do not take it to the SPCA or animal control since they will have no choice but to put it down because of its age.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	aw, im sorry that you cant keep the cat - yes, he is an old cat - so i'd suggest giving the kitty to an older person - do you or your fiance have a grandpa/grandma that would be willing to take him?  <br>  <br>  Thats the sad thing about older cats, a lot of people, if they're going to get a new cat - they want a kitten..<br>  <br>  Please keep searching for someone you TRUST to give the cat to.  If you brought him to a shelter he would probably be there for a long time and that's no life for any cat.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are other options -  Theres an allergy shot that you daughter could get every 3 months (or every month) that will prevent the allergies.<br>  <br>  Your fiance is agreeing to give the cat away?  He's not upset at all about it?<br>  <br>  There's no way i'd give one of my cats up after having them for 13 years... think about how traumatizing that's going to be for the cat|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Have you thought about offering financial support to any family member or friend who will take this cat into their home?<br>  <br>  I know that the main concern with taking in an older cat, is the chance of health issues that can be expensive!<br>  <br>  There is hope for older cats, but it's not a quick process. Finding a good home (outside of family & friends) will take a while.|`|zpwJR60baa	Try craiglist, laundry mat and local grocery store...<br>  <br>  Sadly cat always get the boot after many years they give us the loving...<br>  <br>  I take my allergy shots and it helps, and does not bother me. Cat are part of my life...|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I don't know a massive amount, but, firstly, I'd test if she's actually allergic to this cat (if you don't know already).  People are not always allergic to all cats.  Secondly, it's often the saliva rather than actually the fur. I heard wiping the cat down with a damp cloth every day can help.<br>  <br>  If you still need to find a home, maybe you could ask someone to take him with the agreement that you'll pay any vet bills/health insurance.  (If age is the only reason, and it's not because of worries about vet bills, then what do they think they are going to do with their own cats when they get old?)<br>  <br>  PS: be very careful about Craiglist etc: make sure you see any potential home, have agreement to visit later and maybe a contract.  I have heard tales of people getting cats through such list for labratories, bait for dogfights, etc.|`|jy9Jn0Xoaa	If you cant find a way to keep it at all then try networking...just because your friends don't want the poor old girl maybe they can ask around to their friends and so on. If you go that route maybe someone knows someone that knows someone that would like her. Oh by the way 13 isn't that old, she may be middle aged but shes not a senior citizen yet. Cats can live to be 20 and even a bit longer given the cat and the right food and environment. I bet she still has plenty of years left in her to love someone unconditionally. Please don't send her to the humane society because they will view her as old and their philosophy is that nobody wants an old cat so she will not be given that long of a chance to be adopted before they put her down (that's our humane society's attitude in my area) .|`|ERXFkpxKaa	There are no kill rescue shelters that would take the cat. They have foster people too that will sometimes take the cat as well. There are people out there that will take an older cat...You should contact your vet (if you have one and see if they have any ideas). I don't think it is entirely true that no one will take the cat because it is old- yes a lot of people won't because they want a kitten but ya know what a kitten grows up! Anyway, my husband and I have 5 cats (had 6 one passed away a few months ago) and out of them we got 3 of them when they were either adult or senior. Two of them we got when they were around 12 or so. I have allergies too and I have learned to wipe that cats down, keep them out of the bedroom, etc and I am ok.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I'd be scared to advertise the kitty and give to anyone you don't know. I just read an article on a guy who tortured and killed over 38 cats. And he was even at a lady's house with the one kitten for two hours before she'd let the kitten go with him. You can't tell who would do things like this no matter how nice they seem. If you don't know the person well it would be kinder to put the kitty to sleep. And I don't like saying that.<br>  I know you don't want your child on meds. But I'm terribly allergic to cats (I have 18 now) and the meds work wonderfully! I'd rather die than not have my kitties.

Because if she has coccidia, the other pups probably do too and should be getting treatment.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-GLAD you got her to the vet!  Thsi is why you see so many answerer's saying go see the vet'.  The advice here is often well-meaning, but with many health issues, the vet is the only one who can treat/diagnose many problems.

uLYlQMs3aa	Hands down if you have the extra cash... A rainbow boa. They are gorgeous snakes, one of the most beautiful in my opinion.<br>  If you want to try something different then try one of the good looking tree snakes, say emerald boa or green tree python they top out around 6 feet or so usually though may be different.<br>  Um for the cages the same cage that houses your ball python would be fine for a rainbow usually though I tend to go a bit bigger just for the comfortability of my snake. i would look for something say 18"-24" deep about 20"-30" high and along about 48"-60" long that should provide plenty of room for a rainbow.<br>  Um for the tree boa or python they are a bit more complicated so I would try to go to a good research site first and look in to them for they need misting systems and foliage and limbs to feel at home do to being an arboreal species.<br>  Either way good luck and have lots of fun with your new pet!!|`|hOa5b4pyaa	Mexican rat snakes are nice they often come in a shiny black color they don't get bigger than a ball python and have great temperments.

Cfk1kr8Daa	* ARRRRRRGGGGH!!!! *<br>  <br>   Do NOT tie up any herding breed!<br>  <br>   Your Aussie deserves better treatment than this - all they ever want is to be near their people, and tying up an Aussie is certain death.  Given enough time, there will be a broken limb, and probably a hanging.<br>  <br>    If you cannot make arrangements for your Aussie to be with you, a family member, or safely in a crate or with you, please contact Australian Shepherd Rescue and Helpline to have us rehome your dog.<br>  <br>   If your Aussie would like to be outside without you, the proper way to do that is to put up a safe chain link kennel - there are apnels available that screw together.  No ropes involved, and your dog will be protected from other animals as well as confined.<br>  <br>   AUSSIES SHOULD *NEVER* BE TIED UP!!!|`|iVQULHqYaa	I shudder when I see questions like this. An Australian Shepherd is active and highly Intelligent. He needs long walks, company and fun. Why can't he live in the house?. If this is not possible, why did you get a dog if you have not got safe and comfortable accommodation for him. It is cruel to keep a dog tied up, get him rescued to a loving home.<br>  <br>  Try taking him for a walk instead of letting him run around the fields.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Don't tie him up. Build him a nice safe fenced in yard.|`|bHgQ91Kbaa	A harness should work fine, but why do you need to tie the dog up?  <br>  <br>  It would be best for your dog if you could eventually build a fence or a kennel of some sort, so the dog has more freedom of movement.  In the meantime if you are going to tie up your dog, make sure that he can get into the shade when it is hot, and has plenty of food and water available to him when you are at work or wherever.  Also a dog house would be good for those colder days so he can get out of the wind.  Also make sure there are no objects for the dog to get the chain tangled up in.<br>  <br>  Also if you are tying up your dog for long periods, he could get a limb caught in the chain or strangle himself.  Dogs need attention and security.  A chain in the yard does not allow your dog to get away from another dog who could attack him.  It happens more often than you realize.  <br>  <br>  It is also extremely important that you take your dog out for regular exercise, they need to run and play off the leash or chain.  Take him to a local dog park, if you have one in your community.  <br>  <br>  If your dog is seemingly incorrigable or untrainable you are wrong.  There are many Obedience training classes available in any community.  It is worth the time and expense to have a well behaved dog.  Both you and your dog will get what you need out of the relationship.|`|fboC1N7gaa	<a href="http://www.dog.com/collars-leashes-and-tags/dog-harness/?intid=TBB00002711&srccode=TBDOGP" rel="nofollow">http://www.dog.com/collars-leashes-and-t...</a>|`|4KTmiQ0paa	My dog had the same problem and a harness really helped.

TdrgZwnoaa	That is indeed tragic and a terrible way for any animal to die.<br>   The other dog did not 'attack' your dog. It was defending it's territory. Their yard was fenced and your dog elected to get into it. The law will more than likely side with the neighbour in this case.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If your dog slipped underneath the neighbor's fence and into THEIR yard then the other dog's owner should not be legally liable for ANYTHING.  YOU failed to contain YOUR dog and were breaking any local leash laws.  I'm sorry that your dog was killed, it's a horrible thing to go through, but you were the ones who were neglectful here.  Your neighbor's dogs were on their own property in their own yard which is securely fenced (or at least secure enough to contain their dogs).  That's not really your neighbor's fault.  It doesn't matter if they know that their dog is aggressive...there is no law against owning aggressive dogs and they didn't break any laws by not anticipating that your dog would go under the fence.<br>  <br>  Nothing *should* happen to the attacking dog.  The dog was on his own property and your dog was the one off leash here.  You can take it to civil court if you like, but the fact that it was your dog crossed onto your neighbor's property is going to make it very difficult, if not impossible, to win the case.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-This happened in the other dog's yard, so what did that dog do wrong?  He was protecting his own yard.  Sorry for your loss, really I am, but you cannot hold a neighbor responsible for what happens in their yard.  Sounds like yours needed to be restrained better into your yard!|`|AA11244754	Nothing can happen with the dog that actually attacked since you and your parents lost control of your dog by Chubby getting out of your yard and going over to theirs.  Their dog was just protecting it's domain.  Your parent's on the other hand could get into trouble for not realizing that there was a problem with the fence and doing everything in their power to fix the problem with the fence where your dog escaped from your yard and into theirs.  Now if it were the other way around and the dog that attacked your dog had managed to get into your yard then you could sue for vet bills.  As far as your folks being held liable for negligence then no they can't only the pet owner of the dog that you feel is vicious can for not controlling his dog and doing everything in his power to make sure that he keeps the dog on his property.|`|Bw18seFqaa	nothing will happen.<br>  <br>  Your neighbors are not responsible for any damages..  your dog went into their yard..  you are the one who neglected to properly contain or control yours.  The ACO was wrong that they would be cited..   in fact, if your dog did any damage to THEIR property, or inflicted any damage on your dogs that required vet care.. YOU are the one that can be cited for damage to property!<br>  <br>  Its not unusual for dogs to have prey drive or to attack other animals that come on to their property.. they dog wont even likely be labelled as dangerous.  Had it been a child, yes the situation would be different.<br>  <br>  Dogs are considered property, not dependants or family members, in the eye of the law.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Unfortunately, Cubby got into THEIR yard.  He didn't belong there.  Neighbor's dogs were restrained properly in their back yard.<br>  <br>  I think this was a tragic accident.  You can't blame their dogs from attacking animals in their back yard.  You're right, it would be a whole nother story if it was a kid.<br>  <br>  I hate dogs like that.  They're wild, untrained, except to attack.  The world would be a better place without them.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|L22hVXTIaa	So sorry to hear about your poor little dog.  How sad to lose a little guy that way :-(  But, since your dog entered your neighbor's yard, there's not a lot you can do.  You should still report it though as I believe animal control will come out and speak to them about 'dangerous dog' laws that may apply.  But, again, your dog entered their property, so you are probably out of luck.|`|AA12190977	i don't think anything should happen to the other dog, especially since you don't know which one it was. all that dog was doing was protecting it's territory. you want to put a dog down after your parent's dog got into their yard? they were minding their own business, and properly restrained. im sorry for what happened, really that sucks, but come on.|`|14b8d6b25a350fc05dceefa9b229f6cfaa	I'm so sorry you lost your dog in such a horrific way.  :-(  That's the problem with fences -- they're not always that secure, especially for such a little guy.<br>  <br>  There's not much they can do about the other dog.  For one, your little guy went into their yard, not the other way around.  And they also won't know which dog was responsible.|`|bd0e62f6649334b0dc67af506ebd7128aa	Depends where you live. In my county, a dog that kills another dog must be put down, with only a few mitigating circumstances. The fact that your dog was on your neighbor's property could work against you here.<br>  All attacks, though, should be reported.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	Unfortunately, because your parents' dog was the trespasser, no legal action could be successfully taken.|`|be11b7cf9c05865ccde9b041f5cb3008aa	The other dog could be put down :-/|`|3EaFjsA8aa	If Cubby went into your neighbor's yard then the owners are not at fault.  The aggressive dogs were in their own yard.  <br>  <br>  Technically if the neighbor's wanted to be jerks they could press the issue and have your grandparents sited for allowing their dog to run at large.  Also, depending on the breed it might not be an aggressive thing as much as instinct.  It is like a beagle killing a rabbit or a JRT killing a chicken... to them it is prey.  Dogs don't understand that Cubby was a family loved pet and not prey.<br>  <br>  Now, if the aggressive dogs were not in their own yard that is an entirely different issue.  Aggressive dogs must be muzzled when outside (this is true in most city / states.  you need to check the laws in your area).  In some cities they have passed laws were aggressive dogs must be muzzled in their own yard too. Might want to check on that.<br>  <br>  I am not defending what the dogs did just letting you the facts.<br>  <br>  Since no one knows for sure which dog killed Cubby (I am guessing they all did. Dogs are pack animals) there isn't a lot that can be done. BUT if you knew for sure which dog killed Cubby and really pressed the issue a court might order the dog to be euthanized.<br>  <br>  Calling animal control and filing a police report is the correct thing to do because if a child does get injured by these dogs, it is documented that the dogs have a history of aggression.<br>  <br>  Unfortunetly laws suck and a dog or cats life is of no value to our legal system :-(|`|FUcYuZ8saa	That's a terrible thing to happen.  I'm very sorry.<br>  <br>  You parents aren't legally required to do anything.  It would be helpful to report the incident though because when it happens again,  and it will happen again, a pattern has been established that can build a case for the dog to be put down. It could be a small child the next time. Is the neighbor not taking any responsiblity at all?  <br>  <br>  I think may want to consult a lawyer about this.  Then you can decide what action, if any, you want to take.  The neighbors should take responsibility for the actions of their dog.|`|EJqsqnZFaa	Unfortunately, since your dog was in their yard there is nothing you can do. Technically, their dogs did nothing wrong. Depending on their general demeanor they were probably just protecting their turf from an intruder. Im so sorry about your parents dog, what a terrible accident.|`|ZZKMK6t9aa	Definitely have them report it! These things need to go on record. <br>  <br>  My mom's miniature dachshund ran away and ended up at the police station. The stupid police man reached into the cage to get her out and duh, of course she bit him! Where my parents live, dogs only get 3 reported bites and they must be put down. <br>  Your parent's neighbors are totally out of line letting their dog be that aggressive, let alone not being there to stop it. They definitely need a ticket/citation to hopefully wake them up. <br>  <br>  This type of situation makes me so mad. <br>  Honestly to answer "what should happen to the attacking dog" I would say your parents should get a gun. If any of the neighbor's dogs ever come close to their property, shoot it. However that's probably not going to go over very well... If their dog ever acts aggressive to a person, it needs to reported so fast. And I'm even tempted to tell you to provoke the dog because he deserves to be put down. However again, that's not the best idea. If he killed your parent's dog, there's no saying what damage he could do to a person. Better not put yourself in that situation. <br>  <br>  But seriously, what if the postman was the one that got maimed instead of a dog? There has to be something they can do. They're just lazy! I called animal control because some stupid person had their lab in a crate in back of a pickup on a below freezing night in the movie theatre parking lot. Obviously they weren't coming out any time soon. Animal control came down and when I called back they said it looked like an outside dog. Idiots! The dog was shivering with no way to keep warm. <br>  <br>  Another example of authorities not caring enough about pets:<br>  My brother's bird got out of the house, but couldn't really fly away because of clipped wings. The bird did however hop from branch to branch to the top of a tree. My mom called the fire department who would not come to get the bird down. My brother decided to climb the tree to get the bird. The wind picked up and he was up so high he was swaying with the tree and couldn't move. My mom called the fire dep. again and they had to come to get my brother down. So while they were up there they got the bird.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'll get of my soapbox now... but DO SOMETHING! This is completely unacceptable. Maybe even hire an attorney. I mean you and your parents have no reason to believe the dog won't attack you next. I don't know your laws, but even if not much happens due to your parent's reporting this, there has to be some limit to the number of times this is allowed to happen. Every bit counts. <br>  <br>  And have you talked to the neighbor? I'll go tell them off for you.
ygGr1nX7aa	A friend of mine has had many ferrets, and seems to discipline them by holding them by the scruff of the neck, saying NO loudly in their faces and tapping them (not hard) on the head or mussing their fur the wrong way.  Certainly nothing that would cause lasting injuries, that amounts to abuse :(<br>  <br>  As it is his pet, there's only so much you can do unless you want to report him to the relevant animal care authority.<br>  <br>  However, I'd be careful about him in general.  You can tell a lot about people by how they treat their animals.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Report the SOB to the police for animal cruelty, then dump the git and take his ferret with you (or maybe the police will do so), like the previous guy said you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their animals.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	Sorry, but my only advise is to ditch the boyfriend.|`|Ndw34J0daa	You should take your ferret to the nearest ferret rescue shelter and surrender him right this very instant. Now. Neither of you have any right caring for an animal. Shame on you for standing idly by while your boyfriend abuses the ferret. Then, you should both go to the doctor and have yourselves fixed. You should never be responsible for another living thing. <br>  <br>  The ferret has no concept of why it's being beaten. All of my ferrets have used litter boxes, without fail. Keep the boxes clean, scoop them every day. Use litter that is not offensive to them (Sweat, newspaper pellets, or just a newspaper; no cat litter). Wake your ferret up before you let them out so they can go in the litter box first. Clean the area on the floor where the ferret has started to go with a cleaner that does not contain ammonia. They are attracted to the places that smell like they should be going there. <br>  <br>  And seriously, if I knew where you lived, I would call the authorities on you in a heartbeat.|`|ivOpNL8uaa	you should rehome the poor thing!|`|LlajAfntaa	Thank the good lord above I don't know your BF!!! Get rid the abusive POS, he is NO good. Its a ferret, the poor little guy cant even fight back. For every time your BF spanks him, kick the BF in the balls and I bet he would stop.... Unless he would then abuse you.... Are you catching what Im throwing your way??? GET RID OF THE BF!!!!<br>  <br>  Take the amazing creature you CHOSE to take care of to the nearest vet and go everything in your power to make him better. Remember, you chose the ferret, he didn't choose you. TAKE CARE OF HIM!!!|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	You do realize your boyfriend is abusing your ferret?  In no way, shape or form should that be allowed (if he was my bf--he'd be gone at the first SIGN of a personality like that).<br>  <br>  That is a HORRIBLE way for your ferret to live.  I don't care what your boyfriend told you, I would not trust him around the ferret.  He should not be supervising OR taking care of the ferret.  You should (to avoid that scenario again, if you don't kick the guy out).<br>  <br>  There are only TWO proper ways of disciplining a ferret.  1) Scruff, hiss, then say no! (I usually say give a LIGHT shake, but in this case, I wouldn't do that to a ferret that's been physically abused.  Because even though it simulates a mother ferret's discipline, it's probably to trigger-ish for your fert to handle) 2) Time outs (no longer than 10 minutes).<br>  <br>  In no way should a ferret be hit, sprayed or smacked.  It just teaches the ferret fear and aggression.<br>  <br>  Obviously, you need to either rehome the ferret so he gets a loving, fear-free environment, or you need to get rid of the boyfriend.  A person who abuses and torments an animal is not someone you should want to be with.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	I would have a HUGE issue with your boyfriend....<br>  He is hitting this ferret so hard, he is causing INJURY to him...<br>  <br>  Personally, I would rather rehome the ferret, than allow this behavior in my home!!!<br>  <br>  It's a FERRET. Perhaps there is a reason for not using the litter box, and instead of working to find a solution, your boyfriend is just abusing the poor thing....<br>  <br>  Get rid of the ferret (or get rid of the boyfriend...)
qJ9o3iQnaa	I think they are absolutely adorable!!!<br>  <br>  Is a hedgehog right for you?<br>  <br>  hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal animals and can take a long time to become accustomed to being handled. A hedgehog owner should be patient, gentle, and willing to accept that their hedgehog may not keep the same hours as they do.<br>  <br>  If you get one.. don't name it Sonic, that's what everyone does!!! :-)|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Hedgehogs are wonderful pets.  They have 'very small brains' but they have tons of 'charm' ... I've had my hedgehog for just over 5 years, so she's getting old (she was a year old when I first got her) but I'll be getting a new one after she dies.  Get a good aquarium (15-20 gallon) and get a 'half log' that is 'hollow' so she can 'hide' ... get her a good heavy food bowl and water bowl, and get some LIGHT pine cat litter, and your new hedgehog will be a very happy pet.  NEVER let yours out alone on the floor, though ... use a 'large rodent ball' ... because Tiggy got 'lost' and I was heartbroken ... but just as I was sitting down to look for a replacement for here, she nudged my foot ... three months later, with NO food and NO water anywhere she could reach them. I've got a couple of hedgehog books that say that hedgehogs like to eat some 'people food' and play with toys, but mine just eats dry cat food (the expensive 'diet' food that I buy from our pet store ... 7 pounds lasts her a whole year, though) and her 'favorite' toy is an empty toilet paper roll.  She is a hedgehog, and they don't have very good 'close up' eyesight, but they can 'see' down the toilet paper tube or paper towel tube as if they can see 'out from a hedge.'  Tiggy is a wonderful little pet, easy care but a lot of fun!  Get one ... you'll be happier than you would if you got a sugar glider.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	And they are lucky|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Hedgehogs are much easier to care for and cheaper than sugar gliders...my two gliders are costing me the US equivalent of $35 a week, plus I have to spend hours with them every day taming them, even then they can be quite nasty when they feel like it. On the other hand my hog is friendly and sweet but not too fussed if I handle him (although he likes getting out for a run) and his diet is very simple....just high quality light dry cat food like Eukanuba and Science Plan, and treats of dried crickets and mealworms (or live if you prefer), wet cat food and cottage cheese. He lives in a big plastic bunny tank (3 foot minimum) and has a reptile heat mat cos my house is cold (if temperatures fall under the 70-80's degrees F he will hibernate, cos he's an African hedgehog this would kill him).<br>  <br>  In short, hedgehogs are much better pets, in the sense that they are less commitment and cost less money. Sugar gliders are amazing but you have to throw tonnes of time and money at them for them to be tame.|`|JKIWCgbUaa	just ask D Hedgekong|`|k3V1Hn5Kaa	no|`|7ZjloThDaa	Hedgehogs make great pets just make sure you do your research on them first. They need certain things in their diets and need to stay within a certain temperature range and of course have certain cage requirements as with any exotic animal. As for them being legal they are legal in the US but there are a few states where they are not legal. The link below has great information on them along with which states its illegal to have them in.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hoodpetz.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hoodpetz.com/</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps, good luck.|`|4Sc3FAwUaa	They are awesome pets. Mine, Inspector Quills, passed last month. But he lived to be 7 and was a complete bad ***. Just make sure you're getting one for the right reasons. I've heard of plenty of people just getting one because it was "cool" and then the poor thing sat in a cage it's whole life. I mean you don't have to spend hours upon hours of time playing with them, but you can't just leave them chilling in a cage all the time. But I highly recommend them as pets. I know I'm getting another one.|`|EUGoxWXuaa	Hedgehogs are great pets<br>  Pros- they are small, loving, don't need to be walked or brushed.<br>  Cons- they are spiky, leave droppings, cost money and like to chew.<br>  <br>  If you are going to take it into your backyard, make sure it is safe for the little critter!|`|cd5XgMH7aa	Oh I have been wanting one, but i have enough to do with my two dogs!

kClboMuuaa	What ever you do DON'T GET ANTHER MALE !!!<br>  males will fight for territorial reasons and most likely kill one another or create seriously injuries leading on to health problems ... a 40 gallon tank would be fantastic as long as its heated properly the cage should be between 82 to 88 degrees all day and night.the cause of you leopard geckos death impaction if your leopard gecko was showing the symptoms of vomiting, lacking appetite or lumpy stomach, this might be a sign of impactions which may cause serious health problem to your gecko. <br>  The cause of impactions maybe lack of calcium (leopard geckos will eat the substrate to supplement its diet), dehydration (lacking of fresh water), or overfeeding ...<br>  I would recommended that you seek your veterinarian if this problem happens again. However, these may be the home treatment for impaction that you may try out ...<br>  Make sure easy access to fresh water thats changed daily ...<br>  Replace your natural substrate with paper towels ...<br>  Better feeding schedule ...<br>  10 minutes warm water soak 2 times a day <br>  There are many causes that may effect your leopard gecko's health such as incorrect cage lighting and temperature setting, vivarium setup, malnutrion due to wrong choices of food for feeding and others. those are some thing you could follow to keep your leopard gecko happy and healthy ... if you are going to maintain male and female in the same inclosure there isnt much you can do to stop them from mating you could simply put the two in seperate inclosures of have a go at incubating the eggs .. here is a website you can visit to find more out about leopard geckos and also it helps you through the breeding stage and the incubation of the eggs ...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/leos.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progeckos.com/caresheets/leos...</a><br>  Kind Regard Joel|`|ry9Eu92baa	a 40 gallon tank out be great for them, I definitely don't recommend anything smaller than a 20 long for 2 leopard geckos. <br>  Stick to a leopard gecko close to the same size as the one you currently have. If you get one too small, your leopard gecko will most likely kill it. <br>  Also, males would be a lot harder to put together now because of territory issues. I would recommend getting a female, and just make sure you're supplementing the food with calcium.|`|E9SAv17saa	You should get a female not another male they will fight to death!|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Never put two males together..................yes it can be done, but usually the geckos have to grow up together as you mentioned. <br>  <br>  Yes, the "egg situation" is rather complicated. There's nothing wrong with housing a male and female together, but the female really should be separated if she becomes gravid to reduce her stress and allow her to develop and lay the eggs in peace. Also, any female that is below 50 grams should not be kept with a sexually mature male. If bred too young, the female can suffer serious health risks and complications. <br>  <br>  A 40 gallon tank would be fine for about 5 geckos, so that would definitely be alright for two geckos. However, I still recommend separating them if the female becomes gravid.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to just buy a Sterlite container to put the male in if the female ever becomes gravid.....that or just buy a separate tank and keep them separately all the time.<br>  <br>  BTW concerning morphs, "Jungle" simply means unusual patterns or aberrant-like patterns/striping. A true "Jungle's" tail rings are broken. <br>  <br>  The orange ones are called Tangerines, Hypo-Tangerines, or Super-Hypo-Tangerines depending on how much spotting they have(if any).|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Don't put another male in there as someone else stated they will fight and no you may not see it and could be the cause of the death of the other one. If you are willing to get a 40 gallon and you really want another male, I would get a 20 instead and put the other one in that. You can put 2 females with 1 male but then you will have eggs sooner or later. <br>  Your choice but please don't put the 2 males together. <br>  I have seen the jungle one that you referred to and the color is just beautiful. Have you thought about checking to see if there is a reptile show coming anywhere close to you. I have seen some really beautiful ones at the shows and the prices are usually a bit cheaper.|`|wLgGD63raa	Do not get another male. To be honest with you, your male that is still alive probably killed the one that died. They are solitary animals in the wild, and they like it that way. Males fight, no matter how long they've been in the same tank together. Also, if you don't want babies, then don't get a female to put in the same tank with him. If you want another gecko, the safest way to keep them both, is to keep them separated.

If she is still lame I would call the vet for suggestions or leave her on stall rest and see if she gets better. <br>  <br>  My horse is notorious for getting things lodged in his frog. :) He limps or just walks "off" with it in, and most of the time he's fine when I pull it out. Sometimes a little lame for a while but it's never taken more then a day for him to be back to normal.|`|AA11635143	Best to call the vet and get instructions before removing the twig.  You could break off part of it and leave it in the foot and cause an infection.  As you probably know, horses don't do well with foot injuries and you really should have the vet look at it and/or prescribe some medication for it.|`|3GeJ50SWaa	Call the vet first. He/she wont charge you, but I know my vet will tell me what to do, unless it needs antibiotics or vet care. So ring the vet, and see what he thinks. I would be in the barn when you call so you can tell him what it looks like. I wouldnt leave it in there to long though, call him right away.|`|sX17XtVWaa	Depends how deep it is.I would call a vet if not sure.If its only close i would take it out ,then soak the foot in Epsom salts.And wrap it in a sterile bandage (poltis)with bran and baking soda.Keeps the infection out.I would watch for infection,then give peniciilin.Bathe the foot for a few days.|`|KqjVgJdSaa	No dont pull it out!

If your horse seems to be in more pain while you're doing this, you may want to call the farrier. Good Luck!! Hope I helped.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Pull it out. Soak foot in hot epsom salt bath, wrap the foot.  You can use layers of gauze soaked in iodine/betadine/epson salts. Then wrap the foot with a wrap (vet wrap if you got it).<br>  If you dont have that, you can soak a small wash cloth, put a plastic bag on the foot then wrap with duct tape.<br>  Get a tetanus shot if he is not up to date on them.<br>  If when you pull out the stick and there is no blood, it will probably be ok.  You will need to change the bandage at least every two days for about a week-10 days.<br>  If you are unable to do any of the above.. pull out the stick and get the horse to a vet.|`|8cikAYp3aa	by all means bother your vet and farrier.   they want your money and have nothing better to do with their time.<br>  <br>  Good god.

rTMwWFqiaa	I don't think it's a good idea to keep a dog locked in a car when you aren't there.  Someone could steal her.  And, what if the sun started shining and it got really hot in your car?  It won't stay cold forever.  <br>  <br>  If you insist on taking her, put a very small dog house in the back of your van with plenty of blankets in it.  Make sure she has plenty of water.|`|h7N0BGfRaa	No way, I would never leave her in the car all day, it's FAR too cold out right now.  She'll be miserable.  I am sure she would gladly choose to stay home in the warmth than get a crappy walk between classes. Paper train or litter box train her (purina sells dog litter) if you are that worried about it, theres a lot of ways to get around that.  Dont leave her in the van!|`|a253156796b88448d1ead50a3bca4698aa	DON'T|`|wRPuGTHMaa	I would never keep a dog in a car for any length of time over 20 minutes.  It's dangerous for any dog to be kept in a car, plus it's abusive.  She doesn't really like being in your van by herself.  You would have to keep the windows down for her to have good air ventilation...then you need to buy her a doggy sweater to keep her warm.  Trust me...it would be so selfish if you kept her in there.  If I encountered it, I would call animal control and have her taken away from you.|`|pd5rERcfaa	I don't think keeping your dog in the car for an hour or two is very fair to her, no matter how warm it is.  I'm sure she would be more comfortable at home in her familiar environment.
N28zLxtpaa	You can buy heating blankets, or a heat lamp.  You should cover the floor with straw or a dog bed for sure and have a flap over the door to cut down on any wind.  Don't have the dog house too big for the dog, they can keep a smaller space warm with their body heat, but if it's too big they can't stay warm.  <br>  Basically the first thing is to protect them from the elements (shelter), then add a heat source.|`|53nnzpBxaa	if your crate training your dog, then adding a blanket that smells like people will  go a long way to sooth the cries of distress from your dog.* make sure you check on the dog to see that it is not actually in distress. when crate training our pups we use an old smelly t-shirt that has been worn during yard work, it calms them a lot just to be close to your smell.<br>  p.s. don't expect to be able to wear that shirt again.|`|AA10283947	His fur will keep him warm, place some drop curtains across the door ...similar to fly curtain this will reduce draught, closing behind him, as he enters the kennel.<br>  Be sure the kennel is large enough for his comfort.|`|AA11230878	Go and cuddle up with him to keep him warm throughout the night to see what it is like.|`|K3uVBPTaaa	Bring the dog inside|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Bring it inside where in my opinion it should be anyway.|`|2Q8MmK1aaa	Bring him inside and give him a dog bed/blanket|`|NgZJzEWUaa	I would put a house around the kennel...|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	It's fine if it's a healthy adult Nordic breed that prefers to be outside, but others should be inside at night.<br>  <br>   As for insulation - night or day- hay is actually very good.  The fact that the stems are hollow mean it is made up of little tubes of dead air - which is natural insulation.  Make sure it isn't dusty, moldy, or buggy, and change it fall and spring. 1/2 a bale will more than fill up a regular size dog house.|`|gGQssXS1aa	Make sure the kennel opening is not facing North, as that is the coldest wind direction. You could try putting a split flap of thick material or leather over the opening. Straw is very warm and dogs like to make nice comfortable nest with it. If your dog does not have thick fur, you could put a dog coat on him if it is a very cold night but most dogs grow a good natural winter coat of their own. Don`t use hay as the seeds can get embedded in dogs eyes and fur and if it is dusty it can cause allergies.<br>   The healthiest dog I ever owned lived his whole life out in a kennel and in later life when he was old and I invited him to come and live indoors he did not want to, as he loved his kennel best.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	I would bring the dog inside and get a crate. Put a blanket in the crate and put some soft music on. I know the music thing sounds silly but its the only way I've been able to calm my dog down at night and get her to go to sleep.<br>  <br>  If you have to keep the dog outside at night. Be sure the dog has a bed that is closed in so no cold air could get in. To keep the dog warm, hay or cedar chips are great. If you could put a heat lamp out there too, that always helps.|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	My two springer spaniels love straw!!<br>  <br>  They seriously wont come out the kennel if its cold outside, and we've just put fresh straw in!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just remember to put loads in, and when it starts to get flat, sweep it all out, and put fresh straw in.

They keep the pet of the cold floor, and are water resistant so you are able to leave them out side and not worry of them growing mill-dew. THey also are comfortable and dogs seem to love them. If you realy want to get technical the have some at places with bilt in heaters.|`|RWTIPOfIaa	well if its possible, keep him inside where it is warmer, even if it's in the garage. but if you cant then put a comfy dog bed in there and maybe something with your scent on it, like an old shirt or blanket that you dont mind it getting dirty. then he will smell your scent at night and be more calm and relaxed.|`|51St5GEcaa	Keep tarp over the top of the kennel, and the side that gets the most wind.

Some people delight in abusing dogs or stealing them, then they demand a ransom. <br>  <br>  If your dog lives in your house he will warn you of intruders. There  is no chance of this if he is outside, would be intruders will cut his throat, shoot him and then break into your house.<br>  <br>  Your dog will protect you and your family if he has a warm bed in your kitchen or laundry room. Outside he has no chance of doing this, would be intruders come armed.<br>  <br>  Edit Andy forget where dogs lived thousands of years ago. Yes they lived outside and  humans lived in caves.

With a cross breed, guessing at breeds and learning about them won't help you much - you could have the breeds wrong, and the particular ancestors of the particular dog are more relevant that the generalisations we make about particular breeds.<br>  <br>  I reckon if you like what you know about the dog, go ahead - there are never any guarantees anyway..<br>  <br>  If you are the type of person who wants to know about the dog's genetic heritage and potential then you would be best getting a purebred from a breeder.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Yeah I would definitely say Pomeranian/poodle.

It's really hard to tell from the picture the texture of his fur, and whether that's a baby poodle mix or terrier.  There'd be a big difference between the two.  They should also be able to tell you from where they got him. <br>  <br>    While it sometimes holds true that you can determine from breed descriptions what a mix puppy will be like, sometimes it doesn't apply at all.  As I said before, I would spend some time with him, and speak to the foster about his character.  That's about the best you can do.|`|X8kSi58xaa	I'm guessing Maltese.

T8OFsBUUaa	It's too bad your husband went back on his decision. <br>  <br>  You don't need to take a week off for the dog - especially since being at the humane society, they have probably already kennel trained the dog. <br>  <br>  As far as I am concerned, the decision was made 3 months ago, and seeing as how you are already emotionally committed to the dog, it's a little too late for him to change his mind. Sort of like 5 months into a pregnancy that was planned for someone to change their mind.|`|OFpl236faa	I think he should go see the dog. I agree if he doesn't get along with your other dog or it just isn't a good match, then it's appropriate to say no. I think that it's poopy that he said no after saying yes 3 months ago. I think you don't need a week with the dog because he's older and probably potty trained. Good luck and I hope you can get the dog!
RWTIPOfIaa	give him some more attention, make him feel special<br>  <br>  and congrats on the baby = )|`|u8u0exDtaa	well the dog may be feeling jealous that there is another little thing in the house and in your lifes he may just want more attention try bribing him to eat or giving him a little bit of ppl food with his dinner after a while he will begin eating again its just all so new to him.|`|s76aC4G8aa	when you get into a routine and settled in so will the dog, he's probably anxious and unsure of his place in the pack.  Give him time to get adjusted to the new baby and he'll be fine.

enC9TvxUaa	-Brushing them outside would help keep the hair away form the floor, furniture, and you.  Dogs WILL shed, that's part of nature.  She'll LOVE the regular brushings from the other members in your family too!!!|`|Sl9lwyVdaa	I have a lab mix and she sheds like crazy.|`|H1tokn4uaa	You're getting a dog that's going to shed year-round/wall-to-wall.  Here's what you can try.<br>   1) Get him potty trained as soon as possible.  Most allergies are due to urine.<br>    2)Don't let him lick you.  Allergic reactions can be triggered by a dogs lick as well.<br>    3.) Only bathe him once a month with either an oatmeal shampoo or a hypo-allergenic shampoo.  Dogs don't produce oils as frequently as we do so don't wash them out with frequent baths.<br>    4.)  Brush him with a Zoom Groom by Kong three times weekly.  You won't notice to much shedding until he's about 5-6 months old but it's good to get him used to the brush quickly.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck with the new puppy.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	pits are short haired, labs have medium length. The size of the dog also determines the amount of dander they put off. Larger dogs more dander and dander is what causes most allergies.<br>  My sister has a lab and is inundated with hair all the time. I would say you will have a major hair problem with a pit/lab mix.|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	they will shed a bit. i havea lab/rot and a pit/rot. they will shed but with me its cause i live in the heat. (texas) but as long as you let em play outside as much as you can and let them role around the hair will shed. oh if you wnat your dogs coat to shine. if your feeding it dry food but a raw egg in its food about twice a week. it helps all dogs keep a shiny coat|`|aYZXi6ffaa	oh yeah|`|a253156796b88448d1ead50a3bca4698aa	All good points are made here, one other thing to consider is that if it is the "dander" and it usually is, that can also be kept under control with regular bathing (monthly) using a good dog conditioner and most important do NOT feed your dog (regardless of breed) food that has Corn listed as one of the first 5 ingredients. Most breeds are actually allergic to corn and it manifests itself in their skin and coat. A healthy dog on the inside is a healthy dog on the outside. Good skin = less dander and this is accomplished with bathing and good food.|`|ZZKMK6t9aa	Maybe you should consider another breed. Pit bulls and labs both shed, so a mix wouldn't be any different. <br>  <br>  Although I know someone who is allergic to cats and has two. She just brushes them daily and bathes them often. I bet she has to vacuum all the time though...<br>  <br>  You should look for a breed that doesn't shed, there are "hypo-allergenic" dogs that have hair instead of fur, so they don't shed. <br>  <br>  Please do your research first before getting a dog that you have to give away right away. It's not fair to the dog.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	The good news is cat and dog dander are different so you might not have a problem with allergies.  Good luck on that.<br>  Labs shed but I don't think it's horrible like a retriever.  I have a mixed lab (maybe a touch of pit) and she's short coated that repels water, but she does shed.  She's so short coated brushes don't  seem to help when she sheds in the spring and late summer.<br>  Try a comb when the time comes since they get deeper, than a soft bristle brush to finish off what's hanging around on top.  The other answer was right when they said the dog will love this extra attention.<br>  Have fun with your new dog.<br>  Kath|`|1as4a5OIaa	my friend has a lab whose almost a year and it still didnt shed
AA10229248	Pretty hard to train them not too. Instead you have to outsmart them. Try:<br>  <br>  Putting the litter box up high - like on top of the dryer<br>  <br>  Getting a covered litter box and angling it so it faces a corner<br>  <br>  Putting the box in a room and closing the door enough to keep the dogs out but open enough that the cats can get in<br>  <br>  Putting a baby gate across the door to the room the box is in. Raise it up high enough and the cats can squeeze under it. Or if you have agile cats they can climb over it<br>  <br>  Scoop the litter box as soon as the cat uses it<br>  <br>  Get an automatic litter box that scoops as soon as the cat steps out|`|4fC6EJWfaa	get a covered litterbox that only the cat will fit in...|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	You can keep the kitty box in a cabinet under the counter, or in a closet, and put a kitty door in the door to that.  I solvedit by just putting a couple of eye hooks on the door and the frame, and using a snaphook to connect them.<br>  <br>    The idea is that the dogs need to not be able to get at it - not that any training in the world will ever make it not worth eating. Besides - if the dog is hovering around too closely, the cat won't use it anyway.  And then you have a whole new question -for the Cats section.|`|AA10022347	Find a cat box encloser, with the entry way in and out that is only big enough for the cat. Pet stores should have these in stock, if not check wal-mart, or maybe an online pet store. If you can't find an encloser, Put the cat box in the bath tub, or a closet, somewhere where the dogs can't get at it.  Only reason why dogs eat kitty crap is because of the salt content, believe me my dog use to do the same thing until I got encloser and now that he weights over 60 pounds he's to big for the entry way. Check the website that is listed here and your wonderful cat **** eating dog wouldn't be eating that crap anymore.|`|1M7XTZCyaa	keep up with the litter box.  Scoop poo out.  My dog has done this in the past.  He won't do it anymore cause there isn't any.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Nope.  Just put it where they can't get at it.
NkEHCHsOaa	The intrusive party should always leave, and find a place which is more well adapted for their dog.|`|24CFl7sjaa	The dogs are learning valuable behaviour and social skills from each other. A over-boisterous youngster who 'rudely' approaches a senior dog in the wrong way will be 'told off' by that dog, he will then learn to approach in a more acceptable manner and lessons are learned. The problem comes when the handlers do not realise that the dogs are behaving in completely normal way and intervene. I used to walk my dog dominant terrier in a public park and he would socialise with all the puppies in a gentle but firm manner, it was quite enlightening to watch him correcting the behaviour of the youngsters who had no doggy social skills, he never had to resort to fighting or ever actually 'bit' any of them, but he would growl, snap at them or flip them over when they stepped out of line. Ive seen him chase a large GSD across a field and flip it for being over-boisterous so size is no issue.<br>  In your case there was an over excited boxer who was a bit 'rude' in doggy fashion and the Great Dane was attempting to signal to him that his behaviour was unacceptable, personally I would have spoken to the owners to ask them if they minded helping me socialise my boxer as he had manners to learn and if they were happy I'd stay and let the dogs sort it out between themselves.|`|OFpl236faa	I think the person should get control of the hyper dog. Even though they are just trying to play, the other dogs obviously were giving clear warning signs that they were not enjoying it. Dogs have personal space just like people and all do not enjoy playing with that.<br>  <br>  If your friend takes her dog, I would have her keep a close eye on the puppy at all times! If her dog gets out of hand, puppy goes on leash for a time out. Once settled and listening (able to do some sits and downs for treats, not pulling like a maniac at the end of the leash, ect.) then her dog can go back and try to play again. If the dog won't settle, then it gets a time out in the car and can try to come back again latter.<br>  <br>  If the lady with the boxer didn't remove her dog, then there was the possibility of something bad happening if things were to go too far. You have to make the best decision for your dog and the other dogs around you. So many people are not responsible for their pets and then situations get out of hand fast. Most people think their dog is friendly and they don't pay attention and then that's when something bad happens. That doesn't mean that the other person's dog is nice. You should always be aware of where your dog is and what is going on. Why my family doesn't like dog parks, too many irresponsible owners.|`|XacL7v9Xaa	A boxer pup will always be hyper and "jumpy". Congrats on being able to recognize play from a true aggression.

Boxers are very hyper by nature, they jump and they want to play and well, not every dog mirrors his energy level.  The point of the park is to help release the pent up energy the dog has, granted the offending dogs owner should be the responsible one to leave when the dog is a nuisance and try another day.  It would be no different if someones dog caused a fight, the dog that started it should leave and try again another day.<br>  <br>  Your neighbors dog might be different but when you feel the dog is becoming a nuisance then it's time for you to leave.  that is just park etiquette.|`|Zq6Z3IUnaa	If your own child were misbehaving and ruining a good time for the others....you would take the child home  OR  put them under better control.

fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	The cat has round worm and should be getting a stronger wormer from the vet.  Yes this is soooo gross but is more common than you think.<br>  The vet has one time wormers that will cover all worms for under 10 dollars a pill and usually only one or one and a half pills are needed.  I suggest getting a pill shooter to help give her the pill since they can really spit them out or bite you.  Pill shooters are pretty cheap too.  It looks like a long pencil with a rubber tip on the top that you slid up to shoot the pill down the cats throat.<br>  If you can't take her to the vet look at the stuff you are giving her to see if it covers that worm.  If not go back to the store and read a couple more options.  I'm not sure if one is on the market OTC for this type of worm.<br>  You should worm at least once a year but twice is better.<br>  kath|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	vet. please dont watch your cat puke for 12 hours. would you like to puke for 12 hours?<br>  <br>  OTC dewormers should not be used. let the vet do it, he will test to see which one , of many, worms she has

So, I guess I can see how it could happen, but I'm not sure if that is what did happen. I think the best person to ask is the vet who treated him. S/he can tell you if the renal failure developed as a result of the sinus infections or independantly. Sorry for your loss.

3sB49YNnaa	First off, while there is always some risk with pregnant guinea pigs a nine month old is young enough that there are no extra risks.<br>  <br>  The reason that you are told to remove the boar is not for the safety of the pups but rather to insure that the sow doesn't get immediately re-bred after delivery.  That is not a problem with a neutered male.<br>  <br>  Now for some questions you need to answer to make some smart choices.  First, did you have him neutered or are you taking the pet shop's word for it?  If you think the pet shop did it, are you sure?  If you have had them more than 6-10 weeks (depending on how far along she is), she got bred by your boar which means that he isn't really neutered and will need to be separated from the sow.  You can keep them in a cage with a wire mesh divider so that they can see, smell and touch and that will reduce some of the separation anxiety.<br>  <br>  Be sure that she is getting 18% protein guinea pig chow with stabilized vitamin C, grass hay and plenty of water as well as moderate amounts of greens.  You might put in a second food bowel to make sure her big buddy is not hogging the food.  If you over do the greens she won't eat enough pellets to get the protein that she and the pups need.|`|nPdKJyK4aa	I agree with randc... Pet stores are notorious for lying or not knowing.

Get an opinion from the vet, but baby guinea pigs are the easiest in the world to look after as they are born with their eyes open and up and running! They are tiny so it is a good idea to separate from the male in case of trouble but mine all lived happily together without any fighting or problems.

YnCUyvK7aa	*Brackish* covers salinity from 1.005 to 1.015, so I think that may be part of why you're not able to find any straight answers.  There's too much variability for a single answer to cover everything and what might work at higher salinity may not work at a lower salinity.<br>  <br>  The live rock you see for sale online and in pet stores is collected from or is cultured in full marine conditions, so there would certainly be die-off of many of the living organisms that live on the rock, as these wouldn't be able to live once the salinity drops below 1.015-1.020.  So any of the sponges, the clams, the coraline algae would most likely die [probably the answer you *already know* but are hoping someone will be able to say otherwise].  <br>  <br>  At the price that live rock sells for, it would be less expensive to buy dry rock meant for cichlid tanks or as base rock for saltwater tanks and use those in your tank.  It will be less expensive, you won't have most of the living organisms die off [and the resulting ammonia spike], and it will still grow the beneficial bacteria if you do a fishless cycle first if this is to go in a new tank.  The bacteria aren't as sensitive to the salinity, and will still grow on the rock surfaces.  If you think about it, in brackish environments where the rivers meet the ocean, the tide goes in and out daily, so the salinity would be constantly changing. <br>  <br>  But even though the bacteria will live on the rock, you won't find corals, anemones, or anything like those in brackish environments.  You can get plants for your tank, if it's a lower salinity.  Hornwort, Anacharis, and mangroves [this 1 grows up out of the water, so you have to add lighting from above to keep it alive] are all possible to keep in the tank.  This website has a list of what common aquarium plants can be adapted to brackish tanks.  <a href="http://www.plantgeek.net/plantguide.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantgeek.net/plantguide.php</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Another reason I would suspect that you're not finding a lot about live rock in brackish tanks, is that the bottoms because of the salt and changes of tides is mostly sand or mud, with not much rock.  What you think about with cichlids in brackish conditions are African Rift Lakes which is inland.  So *brackish* water occurs in different environments.  Here are some examples of realistic habitats in pictures.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquarticles.com/images/China4b/p25%20Mangrove%20community.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquarticles.com/images/China4...</a> - mangrove swamp, mud, mangrove roots, and a few rocks<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquarticles.com/images/China%203b/p08%20Africans.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquarticles.com/images/China%...</a> - rift lake aquarium, almost all rocks<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean you have to set up your tank this way though.<br>  <br>  Because your fish are all adaptable to a brackish environment, you can set up the dry rock in the tank now, where it's already cycled, and gradually increase your salinity.  The bacteria will establish on the rocks as you change the tank from freshwater to brackish without having the ammonia spike from the dieoff.  Some of your existing bacteria might die, but some will survive as you change the salinity if you don't raise it too fast.  And other bacteria that's more salt-tolerant will develop.  This is what I do with mollies when I'm acclimating them to saltwater [I have done this 3 times] so they don't have to deal with the tank cycling as well as the salinity changes.|`|2ca2ae314300ec8a2641b57de1558cb8aa	tIf your referring to the live rock in a marine aquarium then no it will not come from the ocean and stay live in a low salinity tank. The rock itself may be used in a brackish tank as with any rock and eventually gain the biological benefits of having rock in your system acting as a biological filter however the deep coralline encrusted rock that you see in a marine aquarium requires higher salinity magnesium and other trace elements in order to live and grow. You can purchase man made rock from a number of dealers on the net that you may wish to look at that you might enjoy as some of them look very natural and can come with pigmented colors that look just as nice as the real thing|`|ur5wDhkMaa	I've just been on a net wander and I see what you mean about no straight answer.<br>  <br>  Looks like you buy marine live rock and expect most of it to die or culture your own and that might not be straight forward.<br>  <br>  I'll suggest a small tank with heater and filter and a suitable rock. Pumice stone would be my choice. Fill the tank with brackish water from a river, let the tank cycle and see what lives. If it works start doing water changes from your brackish tank to this one till its eventually full of aquarium water.<br>  <br>  It would have to be an experiment, the PH in a brackish tank should fluctuate a certain amount and it's not to say live rock can't be kept, it just might not hold the same eye catching appeal as marine.<br>  <br>  It has to be possible, there's probably not a commercial market though.
NUIrBHXgaa	I know shrimp tend to do badly with fertilizers that have alot of copper in them. Some fertilizers are safer than others but no matter what fertilizers you use you have to make sure you don't over dose. <br>  <br>  This site has an article about shrimp and fertilizers maybe it will help.|`|00RgkZF8aa	Yes you can, as long as you don't overdose it.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	That would be a proceed with caution if at all. True plants need trace elements, including copper. But if nothing is eating the plants and they are getting a steady supply of shrimp manure, do they need additional feeding.<br>  <br>  If you go with a weakened dose, you should be OK, there will be a warning if it poses a danger to crustaceans on the packaging.<br>  <br>  I would say never use plant feeder unless you are having problems with the plants. Adding chemicals to create triffids is not a good idea :o) Plant food and snail remover come top of aquarium products you could spend your money on better things.
Cugagyqdaa	Neon tetras. We have a 74 gallon community tank and we have a school of 10 black neon tetras with our other fish. We once had blue neons too. Both are pretty and nice fish. We also have a albino male swordtail. He is the most gorgeous thing. I've never seen a albino swordtail until we found him and they're quite unique. He has iridescent colors and a brilliant orange stripe. We also have ghost catfish. Four of them. And they're nice fish and swim in a nice school. Yea, and cory cats are good too, just get two of them together. We also have one male gourami. Some gouramis can be aggressive though. And we have two plecos.

cSOwqXKxaa	Schipperke!  : )  Where do you think 'skipper' came from?<br>  <br>  I like staffies quite a bit - I suppose you'd want something that is tenacious and will alert you to potential boat thieves.  Also something that won't get seasick.  Most terriers would fit the bill.|`|VSWl45cKaa	I agree with Chancely and Rosalie but not Lotos. Newfoundland dogs are good in the water and lovely dogs  but they are huge, drool quite a bit  and likely to take up too much room in a boat. <br>  <br>  The skipperke is a great choice. Being on a boat is in their DNA.|`|GSf09ALBaa	You want to add another dog?  Just about any dog does well on boats but I would certainly lean towards those who can swim.  Not all dogs can swim.  Of course, you should have a life jacket on your canine friend when not docked.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	A Schipperke, or a Portuguese Water dog - Schipperkes were bred to be boat guard dogs, and the Porties can swim between boats and take messages.|`|Fbi0b8pnaa	Any kind of water dog - Poodles are great swimmers.|`|ug0FnKgeaa	Bro you live on a boat, get a parrot.|`|XMnyOT8Yaa	Newfoundland dogs are great.

H1tokn4uaa	If you want an all natural bone, go with a kiln dried bone (usually stuffed).  They are so hard and they were cooked in such high temperatures that they don't crack or splinter.  The dog usually just widdles away at the bone.  Also, a Bully Stick will be helpful because it is pure muscle from a bull, and loaded with Glucosamine and Crondrotin which is great for labs and other large breed dogs.  If you can't find these, a Durable Nylabone will hold up nicely for about 5 days.|`|RWTIPOfIaa	we have a lab/golden retriever mix that is almost a year and what we did was get him bones that last for a long time! and lots of durable toys! and sometimes even socks! i know that some big bones are expensive, but let me tell you they are soooo worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|aGJmiOMMaa	What about a Kong with filling? This kept my pups busy for hours and they're safe - no worries about choking. You only buy a Kong once, so it's cheaper than expensive treats, and you can play fetch with them too.|`|tsnpv9whaa	Try a kong! I have a lab and a dalmatian when they were pups they loved those things (they still do) it keeps them busy for hours at a time!|`|okAYAGvXaa	A good fresh big raw frozen soup bone. But even this under supervision.|`|AA11776611	My dogs get only raw marrow (soup) bones. I get them frozen at the grocery store or you could get them from a butcher. Cheap and healthy. = )|`|tY14vbrKaa	Deer antler.  Last ages, and dogs love them, and they're completely safe.  Just take it away when it gets small enough to fit entirely in their mouth and throw it out.

However are you sure you can't put cat flaps in?  They can be put through glass, through walls, and there's no reason why you shouldn't have 2 (one into the conservatory, and one from there out).<br>  <br>  In winter make sure there's somewhere warm and cosy in the conservatory for your cat.  A cat igloo might work.  As s/he gets older they might not be able to cope with the cold though.  Maybe if there is power in there you could provide a heated blanket? (EG one with a 12 hour setting).<br>  <br>  I'd actually say heat could be more dangerous in the conservatory.  OK if the doors are open during the day, but it might be a problem on hot nights if it's holding heat from the day, or if it heats up quickly after dawn in the summer.<br>  <br>  If you are getting your cat from a rescue, maybe you could ask them to check out the arrangements.  They quite often do a home visit anyway...<br>  <br>  PS: Have I got deja vu, I thought I'd already seen this question, but if you've posted this before it's been deleted...|`|IRaIxWJKaa	If you do this the first day, how does your new cat know that your home is 'home base'?  I'd keep him in for several days, walk him around the outside, but don't let him out till he KNOWS this is a home, not just some place he's been shoved out and abandoned.|`|ulUEq4uraa	Cats love prowling outside at night, having a warm, comfortable place to sleep during the way and food when they demand it.  Once you have those bases covered, you're good!  :)|`|YxEwDCquaa	that will be fine, you dont have to worry about there not being heating as the cat will be perfectly warm, my cat stays out all night and sleeps all day inside. Is there any other cats near you? because you will need to be careful that they dont go in your conservatory and steal his food, same with hedgehogs haha

muPiBQ3Uaa	The "papers" are as fake as the name "Maltipoo".<br>  There is no such thing as a pure bred mixed breed dog, even if both parents are pure breeds, the offspring is still just a mixed breed mutt. Now, it may be a really nice dog, but it is not a pure bred dog. That is what the truth is, and no amount of hoping, wishing or denial will change the truth. Enjoy your dog, but do not expect those of us who know what the truth is to buy into your world of lies.|`|pm61DB3saa	for on thing a maltpoo can not be Registered not in USA it is a mutt|`|o93EwErKaa	No, you can only tell the truth.<br>  <br>  That you are supporting puppy mills by buying from a petstore.<br>  <br>  The papers you were given were worthless.<br>  <br>  You are lying about the UPS shipping because UPS does not accept mammals.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	So on those papers, I'm guessing there's a heap of champion maltipoos behind your new puppy<br>  <br>  And about puppy mills, yeah must give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside to know you're supporting the kind of people who treat dogs a bit like battery hens.  I mean what's wrong with living in a filthy cage day and night - a bit of dirt never hurt anyone.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your puppy.<br>  <br>  I look forward to your questions about future health problems, and litters down the track<br>  <br>  P.S.  I know someone with a lovely Maltipoo male pup for sale for you to use at stud over Fru Fru. <br>  <br>  This woman is a great breeder - goes well beyond UPS ground delivery.  She's happy to deliver your new pup to you by fax or email.  <br>  <br>  Her dogs eat far less than most and you'll find you have far fewer hasssles than most dog owners. <br>  <br>  Of course you have to sign a contract that says no refund of your $2500 purchase price if you can't sucessfully breed from him, but that's pretty standard.|`|wRPuGTHMaa	You didn't really rescue this puppy from a mill if you bought it.  The money that you used to buy this puppy is going to the establishment of the mills.  To really rescue a dog from a mill, you have to sneak into the mill and steal it.  Don't you dare tell people that.  It would be a lie.<br>  <br>  i like the  guy's answer above mine.  So true.|`|PM23RDycaa	*does Mrs lovejoy impression* Won't someone PLEASE think of the Puppies?!<br>  <br>  ADD: For those who don't realize the SARCASM is this. Tony is digging at people who think that if they talk themselves up enough they are actually SAVING and animal rather than supporting puppymills when they take that poor petshop pup that's "about to be put down if its not bought today" < a common tactic by employees/|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Haha you are at it again huh tony. People come on its obvious what he/she is doing. MAFF is a good registry they register everything, from maltipoos to snickerdoodledoos to wafflefapples. They do not except gooblerdoos because they consider them to be mutts.|`|OFpl236faa	It's a fake registery that'll accept anything. Sorry, but not a purebred. By buying from the petstore, you are supporting the puppymill, not rescuing the dog. It would be rescuing if you got the dog from a puppymill bust at a rescue or shelter, but not the store. I don't base getting my dogs by how cheap they are. I rescue to save lives, not to save a few bucks.|`|8q82dLS8aa	I think no matter where you got your dog, it's good to help give every doggy a little home. A puppy can't help it if it was born in a puppy mill or not, why should it receive less love and less of a home?<br>  <br>  I support anyone who takes their own time and money to take in a little puppy and make them happy.<br>  <br>  You can say whatever you want about your puppy, if it makes you feel better about your puppy. Plus, you kind of did rescue it. If you hadn't bought it, it would have died, right? I mean, it's alive already! You can't make something unborn just because you think where it came from was not a good place.<br>  <br>  Even Obama didn't grow up in the fanciest of houses. Everyone deserves a chance! This is america for godness sake!<br>  <br>  PS, by the way, to all those people telling you your puppy is not pure bred, they're wrong. There are a TON of breeds that are real breeds, that people have invented from different dogs (but how do you think we got all those other breeds in the first place, right?) And, lots of breeds these days are very new, it takes a while to have them recognized by those big groups like the American Kennel Club. But, that doesn't make them any less of a breed.<br>  <br>  People can be really rude on this site, especially when it comes to animal questions. It can make you feel sad. But, this should be a happy moment for you.<br>  <br>  Let me be on of the few to say...Congrats on your new puppy! I bet it's adorable. I know you'll have many MANY happy years together. :D|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	LOl your just keeping the puppy mills in business, not rescuing. On top of that, your mutt has papers? Wow what a joke.<br>  <br>  Ok lets have a little lesson here, what is a Maltipoo? Well, its a Maltese, and a poodle mix. Ok, what makes a mutt? A dog with two or more breeds in him is called a mutt. So, all in all what do you have? A MIXED BREED DOG.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Are you having fun with us here? Purchasing a puppymill puppy from a store causes a litter of pups to be born. It is not a rescue. It is a mixed breed (mutt) and they told you it had "papers" Any fool with a computer can print up fake papers. You paid too much, whatever that was. You could have gotten the same thing from a shelter at a greatly reduced price. Sorry, but they saw you coming and took advantage.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	you can TELL them anything you want...<br>  <br>  But the truth is...you paid alot of money (I'll assume) for a mutt from a pet store who makes profit off of your ignorance.<br>  <br>  you are in truth, SUPPORTING puppy mills by purchasing from a pet store.  You bought a mutt...nothing wrong with mutts, but thats what it is.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Fell for it...hook, line, and sinker|`|XagPxe7Faa	Oh my gosh...it is amazing to think that some people actually think that way!|`|Bw18seFqaa	lol Tony..  your nonesence questions always crack me up!|`|h7N0BGfRaa	no, you would be patting yourself on the back when you actually HELPED the puppy mills by purchasing her.  Most animal lovers know that when you purchase a dog from a pet store, you are encouraging that pet store to buy more dogs from a puppy mill.  You did a bad thing here, sorry. You should have got a shelter dog if you wanted to pat yourself on the back for rescuing.  You did nothing noble here.<br>  <br>  And by the way, its impossible for a maltipoo to have "papers" unless they are fake, its a mixed mutt.|`|S5Lz35myaa	By purchasing from a pet store, you are actually supporting the puppy mills - i.e., the money from the purchase goes to the store who then gets more puppies from the puppy mill, actually creating a need for the puppy mills to produce more puppies.<br>  And papers on a mixed breed are not possible from a responsible US organization.  UPS will not ship dogs (or cats) in the US, so again, that is not possible.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Yes it seems like you rescued it from a puppy mill but actually you didn't. When you buy a dog from a petstore then you just gave money to the puppy mill. Buying pets from pet stores are just supporting the puppy mill so in a way you actually helped a puppy mill. Not good at all. You should get dogs from shelters.<br>  <br>  You need to watch this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZsCwOy5rdI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZsCwOy5r...</a><br>  <br>  P.S. Maltipoo's are a mixed breed so the papers are fake and no such thing as teacup it is just a nicer way of saying malnourished.|`|AA11776611	As sad as it is to see the puppies in the pet stores buying them, like everyone else has stated, only PERPETUATES the puppy mill problem. Everytime someone buys a dog from a pet store you are lining the puppy millers pockets and making them breed more and MORE puppies to sell to these stores. I won't even shop at a pet store that sells live animals any more. I hope you at least learn from your mistake.|`|16XpYCBmaa	I wouldn't tell them you rescued her from a puppy mill because that would be lien to your friends. I would just tell the truth. And also a maltipoo is not a purebred dog it is a mixed breed. But I have nothing against them kinda dogs because i prefer a mixed breed over a purebred anyway.|`|aGJmiOMMaa	First of all - Papers? A Maltipoo isn't a pure bred dog. A "teacup" is a puppy that's underweight for it's breed and in danger of health problems - it's not a "good" thing.  And you did not actually "rescue" a dog from a puppy mill. You just made that puppy mill a success.|`|UTugWDsFaa	if your dog is registerd with the fauna and flora lovers, are you sure it's not one of the rare maltisprouts? It's a breed that's just startin to bud..<br>  I'm sure your dog's rooted in this, and should be pruned for the ring.|`|JREyMH4zaa	Mexican Association of Fauna and Flora Lovers is a bogus registery...in order to be a true Maltipoo it needs to be KFC registered...<br>  <br>  <br>  LOL|`|EJqsqnZFaa	haha sounds good to me, wanna breed it with my pit? dont worry, hes UKC registered and stocky as hell...totally breeding quality. we can donate the money to PETA so that it will be well spent...
iiNAJfGCaa	Believe it or not, a good sitting trot comes through your stomach. It will feel funny at first, but you want to relax back onto your seat bones, relax down through your legs (pushing down with your heels will only brace your body against the irons and make you bounce harder!) and feel like you are "bouncing" with your stomach. If you watch dressage riders on TV you will see that their entire body is active during the sitting trot. They are moving with the horse instead of bouncing against them, and they have very bouncy horses! Relax your body, absorb the bounce through your stomach, and try to establish a rhythm with your horse's trot instead of against it.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	practice ridding with no stirrups go like half way around at a slow trout and then do the other half way around at a little bit faster trout do some halts to make sure the horse is listening also you should sit back  <br>  <br>  i used to hate doing sitting trout because i would bounce so much but ridding without stirrups really helped|`|AA10726599	practice with no stirrups if you are steady in the saddle. You need squeeze power in your legs to sit the trot better. Build those muscles with a small rubber ball between the knees whenever you are sitting down. Squeeze and release, they build the muscles fast.|`|5kUxkun3aa	don't try as hard. the more you think about it the harder it is.<br>  relax.<br>  sometimes shortening your stirrups so your feet are more in the stirrup stops you from thinking you are going to loose them.|`|suTye2m2aa	Riding bareback or with no stirrups can help for sure! Remeber to sit back, and make your body heavy in the saddle. Take deep breaths and really concentrate on having a deep seat. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|1XngLDxyaa	Bareback is always helpful. But avoid getting to much weight in your seat.  You need to learn to have your knees help control your body (hold you in place). And learn to let your hips slightly rock with the movement of the horse. If your bouncing your to ridged, and a heavy seat just will not help.<br>  <br>  Advise I give thoes having problems loosening their hips, if you have a rolling chair of some sort at home, sit in it as if you were on a horse, or as close as possible. Put your feet on the "legs" of the chair, then using the thrust motion of only your hips, more the chair foreward. It wont come immediatly but it does wonders. Also helps your canter too.|`|VZ01nayXaa	The sitting trot used to be really tough for me too, so you're not alone!  Two things that really helped me.  One, try and think of your spine like jelly.  Let it absorb all the motions of the trot.  The key isn't to be super tight and still, but relaxed and settled.  The second thing is at the sitting trot to sort of move your hips in the saddle in a figure eight motion.  This will help you stay with the beat instead of fighting it, and thus, have more success.  Good luck!|`|ynUhXYWdaa	yeahh practicing w. no stirrups deffinitly helps alot...you have to ajust your body unitl you feel comftorable in the saddle...i usually lean back a bit and raise my leg up just a little so it's a little higher than it would be hanging straight...the most improtant thing to do is to relax, getting tense usually makes u bounce more, plus you want to feel compftorable...remember to sit up straight...after some work w.o stirrups, the sitting trot becomes much eaisier with stirrups.|`|a0ZvQVdcaa	It's good you're determined as you have more chance of doing it :)<br>  Here are some tips: <br>  1. Completely relax your body - but don't slouch! <br>  2. Try riding bareback!<br>  3. Keep your heels down and relax your thighs and legs as when you try very hard you may squeeze the horse and go flying!<br>  4. Don't go fast; go slow - so you feel like your going to walk any second.<br>  Hope this helps! x|`|ltSsoysVaa	Riding without stirrups will defo help.Just try to relax have nice long legs,heels down and try and go with the horse try and feel your horse.Don't go against him which is probly what your doing at the moment.Eventually it will come to you :D Also try and lean back a little bit but not to much! reelaxx :D & Breath too.|`|sX17XtVWaa	Relax,relax relax,oh did I say relax.Try and get your but under your self and feel the horse move and try and rock(a little) with the horse.You have to do this a lot at the walk first though.Good luck|`|8xTKwln2aa	What you should do is sit up straight, squeeze your calf's against the horse (not to hard), and put your heels down. That is what I do when my riding teacher asks me to do a sitting trot.|`|7iaX5owbaa	practicing without the stirrups will definatly help just dont do it 2 often it'll rub of some of thr fur.....but othrwize sure go ahead!|`|zrwqYItJaa	what i do is think heavy and completely relax, you might be tense and this is why you are bouncing!|`|pnDZcQKpaa	riding with out stirrups is probably the best thing to do if you're bouncing around in the sadle. it makes you dependent on your leg, and you can't pinch with your knees and you are able to sit deep in the saddle so you don't bounce. sitting trot with stirrups is pretty hard, so don't get frustrated if you can't do it the first try. it takes time to work on things like that, so just practice, and I'm sure you'll get it!<br>  hope i helped :)
enC9TvxUaa	-Any mix with mainly lab would be great, and there are everywhere!  Try the local shelter, petfinder.com, etc.  I would suggest a female for the mothering instincts!<br>  <br>  Glad to hear the kids are getting a new friend!  They are old enough to really enjoy a dog, and the lab would be like an extra little mother to them in very short time!|`|I38WF5aFaa	Most breeds can be good with children.  Some that are better known as excellent family pets are Golden and Labrador retrievers.  My first choice with children is the english springer spaniel.  Some other breeds are American pit bull terrier,  most breeds in the sporting group,  saint bernards and newfoundlands.  I wouldn't recommend a dog from the herding group.  They might try to herd the younger kids.  Don't rule out a good mutt from the shelter.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	I would say a Golden Retriever as the perfect family dog.<br>  try the golden rescue organization in your part of the world.<br>  Just look on line under AKC.org and go to their rescue.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|fboC1N7gaa	I labradoodle, golden doodle or Golden retriver are all good.  I would also consider getting a mutt, they tend to have the best personalities.|`|AxaspNJJaa	A shih tzu! Yup, the perfect breed for you! Fits your description!|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Getting an older dog is great.  <br>  Youre main consideration at this point would be a dog that is best for your 5 year old.  so the toy breeds are out.  Even if your child is gentle, just running around like 5 year olds do they can trip over a small dog and injure it.  <br>  Breed is not as important as the temperament of the individual dog and how good and patient it is with small children.  You want one with medium energy so that it will play with your children, yet not be so rambunctious that it will jump all over them and knock them down.  You want one that will be playful when the kids want to play and be quiet and kick back with the family in the evenings.  <br>  <br>  My personal preference for family dogs are some of the sporting breeds.<br>  Also, some of the herding and working breeds but stay away from the really intense ones like border collies and Malinois for first time owners.  Although really smart & trainable are too intense for beginners.  Some of the herding breeds like corgies may try to herd you kids when they play so be careful there.  <br>  Terriers can be very energetic and hard headed<br>  <br>  What you really need to do is evaluate your families needs and find a dog to match.  Take into consideration grooming requirements also.  You don't want a dog with a long, plush coat if you like to go hiking in the wilderness, unless you want to spend hours picking out burrs.  ect.  Mixed breeds can be awesome family members also, so don't count them out.  <br>  There are many lovely pretrained family dogs waiting for a new home due to their old families losing their homes.  These dogs can be worth their weight in gold.  <br>  Good luck in your search.  Your new family member is out their waiting for you.|`|owe7lyyYaa	Definately a female Weimaraner. They are smart, loyal, loving, good with children and fearless protectors. They put the family above all else, and crave love and attention. they are big enough to handle rough kids and have the energy to play all day. Easy to potty train. These dogs will want to be part of the family though, weims NEED human companionship, they can literally depress themselves to death if you ignore them or pen them up outside. But, if kept indoors they are the best family dogs ever. They can, however, be very suspicious of strangers. You often hear about weims becoming so protective of the family's children that they will keep any and all strangers away from them, even neighbors that they see every day. They are also VERY cute as puppies.|`|0m6BgESXaa	A good Shepherd could be right for your family :-)  I'd buy a Golden Retriever before a Labrador...they're a little more "handler sensitive".  The Labrador can actually be an incredibly stubborn breed, which tends to surprise people.<br>  <br>  A nice merry little dog is the English Cocker Spaniel.  Their coats aren't hard to keep up with (American Cockers have the long flowing coats when left in show coats) if you keep them clipped and neatly groomed.<br>  <br>  They're an incredibly hardy breed for their size, don't have the health issues of the American, can keep up with the older kids, and still remain gentle and careful with the younger one :-)|`|WvUy2FwWaa	most older dogs should be "potty" trained any way <br>  the best dog for a family is a labrador <br>  they are gentle and easy to look after ,yes they may be big but they ar eso lovable<br>  we know 5 families all who have at least 1 labrador and they said they are great with kids and easy to train!|`|1f7k4aJeaa	The best dogs to get are Golden Retrievers.

Every dog has their own personality even if their breed is typically one way or another. <br>  <br>  I would suggest a boxer because they are a lot of fun, but also gentle. Mine sounds really aggressive when she plays, but I can stick my hands in her mouth and she just turns away. Check out the youtube link about a boxer and a baby. Just be aware that they do require exercise. I have mine in a small apartment, but there is a park nearby that we go run in. Another benefit to boxers is that they rarely bark. Mine only barks when someone comes to the door, or when she sees someone she doesn't know. <br>  <br>  I also suggest getting one from a shelter or adopting from your local classifieds. An older dog is usually trained already. Just expect some separation anxiety at first. They were already abandoned once. So do your research. There are great dog breed books you can check out from the library. And be sure to go visit the dog multiple times before making the decision. Going to the shelter provokes feelings of sympathy in everyone and there's a chance you might adopt a dog just to get them out of there. While that's nice, the dog could turn out to be obnoxious and not a good fit for your family. Everyone is going to try to make the dog sound better than it really is. If you find one in the classifieds, make a deal with the owner to put down a refundable deposit so you can take the dog home for 2-3 days or even a week. The first couple of days are going to be tough anyway because the dog is in a new place and confused. When I got my boxer she whined all through the first night she was at my place. I was ready to take her back! But she got better after she felt more at home in my house. <br>  <br>  Maybe you can find someone's dog to dog sit for awhile before getting your own. That way you can learn what it will be like to own a dog and your kids can learn what they have to do to take care of one. If they're not ready to take on that kind of responsibility, are you? If they don't take care of a dog it will be your responsibility and it is just unfair to the dog to adopt and then dump them back at the shelter. <br>  <br>  Other considerations: shedding, food consumption, energy level, grooming, size, and don't forget about supplies: Crate, food/water dishes, bed, treats, leash, collar, tie out, toys...|`|1fe05db00904244e7d959ebb301f5543aa	hi there, I would strongly suggest that there is no breed that is or isnt good with kids-its all on the dogs personality. Might I suggest going to your shelter/pound and take the kids with you-I found a website earlier this week that helps explain what to look for in a dog when going to the pound-the first thing you need to do is make sure the dog is sociable and not too jumpy-I have found many times that a breed doesnt necessarily mean it is or isnt a good dog, I hope I can help you be open minded as there are lots of dogs in shelters that need homes that were surrendered most times not because there was something wrong with the animal but because they couldnt afford to feed/vet it etc and still make eexcellent pets. I have always gotten my animals from shelters-sometimes it is a challenge but never had I gotten a bad animal-they seem to be more loving and loyal probably due to that experience. I will go hunt down that website cause it really explained well how to test a dog that will be good for you and your family.. I will send to you via email...or post here...<br>  Ok here is the link-i sent it to you via yahoo here but here it is incase a lurker is looking, <br>  <a href="http://atlanta.craigslist.org/pet/1037865994.html" rel="nofollow">http://atlanta.craigslist.org/pet/103786...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|rLV7I6q3aa	Golden Retrievers are very good for families. A smaller breed that is great for families is the Bichon Frise. Breed research before getting a dog is extremely important and will make or break the outcome. Look at the AKC website and read other information about qualities found in certain breeds. That said, every dog has its own personality and no two, even if they are the same breed, will be exactly the same. Research the energy level of the dog, how vocal he or she is, and bonding behaviors. You want a dog that will match your lifestyle. It is possible to get a great dog from a reputable breeder or from a shelter. Petfinder is a good resource for finding a shelter dog.|`|pr8M50Lgaa	I would agree with a lot of your other responses that a golden retriever would be a great choice. It rather depends on how much room you have at home. Remember a retriever is quite a big dog and they do need a lot of exercise. <br>  In many ways a mongrel dog may be the answer, particularly as you are thinking of getting an older dog, as by this stage it is easier to spot those with a good temperament. They are also less inbred and therefore are less likely to have psychological problems, they are also generally better from a physical health point.|`|IUM5XfPcaa	I have a boston terrier.

He is bold, tenacious and vocal, and will guard his home and family at all costs. He is dependable and kind, and wants to be actively involved in the life of his family. He isn't the kind of dog who can be left alone in a backyard. He needs your companionship and attention. He is eager to please you and very easy to train, an obedient and quick learner who excels at dog sports like herding and agility. He can occasionally be stubborn and restless, but for the most part is playful, full of fun, and clownish: he will take a handful of food from you, then run away with it and throw it up in the air before eating it! He is outgoing and loves to be outdoors, to walk or jog with you, or go for romps in the woods. He craves both physical and mental stimulation. He needs a moderate amount of exercise, including a long daily walk to expend his energy and so that he doesn't become overweight. He is very friendly, polite and agreeable to visitors, though he can be wary of strangers if he doesn't learn how meet them while still young. He is a very good and alert watchdog who is quick to sound the alarm. He will bark. And then keep on barking! And keep on barking! He needs to be trained to know when it's time to stop. He gets along fine with dogs and cats he knows and has been raised with, but may chase animals he doesn't know, and if he is a male can be aggressive and territorial toward other male dogs. He will often try to boss and herd other animals. He is very good and patient with considerate children, and instinctively protective of them. He may also attempt to herd them by nipping at their heels, and must be trained not to do this. He is very high shedder, so might not be a good pet if you dislike dog-hair or vacuuming frequently.<br>  Appearance<br>  <br>  The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is 10 to 12 inches tall (to shoulders) and weighs 24 to 30 pounds. He has a double coat consisting of a medium-length outer coat and a short, thick undercoat. His coat can have two or three colors, including red, sable, fawn, black and tan, white or blue.<br>  Grooming<br>  <br>  His coat only needs an occasionally brushing but because it sheds copious amounts of hair you might find yourself brushing it daily to keep the volume of hair in your home lower.<br>  History<br>  <br>  The Pembroke Welsh Corgi's origins are somewhat uncertain. He may be descended from Viking dogs of the 9th and 10th centuries, or he may have been brought to Wales in the 12th century by Flemish weavers invited to live in England by King Henry I. There they became farmers, and their dogs adapted to become herders of livestock or guard dogs. In the 19th century, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were mistakenly bred with Cardigan Welsh Corgis, but in fact these are two distinct breeds. They were separated again by the (English) United Kennel Club in 1934, and first registered with the AKC the same year. The breed has become extremely popular in the years since: Queen Elizabeth II loves Pembroke Welsh Corgis, and owns several herself. His AKC popularity was 22nd out of 157 breeds in 2007.

Because depending on that you might just want to bury it so you don't have a dead hamster staring at you every time you open your freezer :-} Maybe you should make her a scrap book or something so she can remember all the good times she had with the hamster. idk if you have any pics i've only just recently found a pic of Tilli.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It's normal for a good mom not to want to leave her litter for the first several days.  Put a leash on her and take her out.  She has to go out to relieve herself.  <br>  <br>  And no, she shouldn't be wobbly.  Didn't you take her to the vet for her post-partum check?|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Please speak to your vet right away.<br>  <br>   It sounds very much as if she could have an infection, and that will not only endanger her, but also the puppies.

vS1Z0inOaa	Might be a good idea to take the small one to the vet...<br>     The fact that his beak has grown long might mean he's not eating enough of the right things. For starters, it'll need to be trimmed. After that, a tortoise's beak should wear down naturally if they're eating well. In the wild their beaks are worn down from grazing on grass and high-fiber, tough weeds, so is that what you're feeding them? No other diet will really contain the right nutrition for a sulcata.<br>     Also the fact that he's not growing could suggest he's not eating enough. It could also suggest he's not getting enough of various nutrients such as silenium, vitamin D (tortoises normally produce this on their own when their skin is exposed to UVB light, but a few tortoises have some disorder or other so that they do not produce it and then you need to add it to the diet), or B vitamins. So it'd be a good idea to have the vet do bloodwork and check on that.|`|wcDy86xuaa	Sex determines size of an animal, also, they may only grow to as large as their habitat will allow...|`|7ZjloThDaa	Female sulcatas are usually smaller than males so if the smaller one is female then that would explain the size difference. You can try giving it vitamin supplements to make sure it is getting the proper nutrition. As for the beak you can actually file it down if the tortoise will let you. Depending on the size and how much they let you touch their necks and heads it could take multiple people. This seems to be a semi common problem with captive tortoises. <br>  <br>  I am not sure if you know how to check the sex of your tortoises but to tell you flip them over and for males the bottom shell (plastron) will be concave and the tail are longer, for females the plastron is flat and the tail is short.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|XlmvIBiAaa	Try putting it in a larger enclosure & possibly find a food that it likes.

SsBTd8WDaa	She just misses you.<br>  <br>  After a few months, female cats will ignore their kittens so they can start surviving on their own.

She never had kittens.  She was a great huntress who was very proud of the prey that she caught.  I just had to be careful that I didn't leave undies around, so she didn't  make her big production dragging them into a music lesson I was teaching.  She did the same thing, when our downstairs neighbors kept her for us.  They called the noise "Luci's battle cry."  We would pet her, congratulate her on her catch,  say thank you and put the laundry away.<br>  <br>  She did this when she was bored and wanted attention.  Who could blame her?  It was always funny.<br>  <br>  You should  tell your vet about this behavior at her annual appointment, or call your vet and mention your concern.  But if your cat is eating, drinking, pooping, normally & she has a normal energy level --- she's probably just hunting and needs more attention.|`|h5zI7Y1qaa	Is this a constant cry like she is searching for something or only when she is rolling on the blanket?<br>  <br>  If it is only when she is on the blanket she is most likely just vocalizing her "fun" she is probably playing with the blanket, especially if it is like a fleece type, Cats LOVE fleece blankets. <br>  <br>  If it is all the time while she is wondering around the house, she may be looking for someone or something. But it is most likely not kittens, as she would have been crying since the day they left.<br>  <br>  Also is she siamese? Siamese cats are much more vocal than other cats just in general.

I know a 28 year old who is still barrel racing and winning. <br>  <br>  I ride a 18 year old TB mare. When people see her they think she is 10-12. We kick butt in the hunter ring.<br>  <br>  As long as the horse is healthy and sound you can enter them in competitions.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	If the horse is sound, healthy, happy and well-trained enough for competitions - go for it. <br>  I would call 18 oldER, not quite old. :) <br>  <br>  This picture was taken last October - this mare is 29 years old and still running harder then most of the younger horses. She's only 13.3 hands too, so that's saying something. :) <br>  <a href="http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq103/awesternwaltz/starandane-keyhole-waconia10-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq103...</a><br>  <a href="http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq103/awesternwaltz/aneandstar-jf8waconia10-4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq103...</a><br>  <a href="http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq103/awesternwaltz/aneandstar-barrelswaconia10-4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i438.photobucket.com/albums/qq103...</a>|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I would not consider an 18 year old horse as old.  Most, with care can go on into their thirties, and some into their forties.  It depends a lot on breeding, feeding, care taken and confirmation.  A horse with bad knees say will not find life easy.  He could, if he was fit and well compete.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	yeah i would stop entering a horse in a competition when it around 25 years old it also depends how good of shape the horse is in <br>  <br>  you could ask your vet the next time you see him or her|`|AA10726599	As long as he is in good physical condition you can show him. He is not old, about halfway there. The feet are important to take care of, NO FEET-NO HORSE.....Best wishes|`|XX03Sd0faa	As long as the horse is fit and healthy, it'll be fine. It all depends on the horse - by 18 some horses are retired, and others can continue competing. You may have to keep more of an eye on an older horse when competing, just to check it's still fine and happy.<br>  <br>  To the person who posted above me - 18 is not old for a horse - they can go on into their late 20s and more. My 18 year old pony is fit and healthy, and does not show his age at all. It's not an ideal age to go into a lot of competing with, however it can be done if well looked after.|`|a0ZvQVdcaa	I wouldn't call your horse old, unless it is in bad physical shape, wasn't healthy or had a bad accident - if it has any of those then I would say it was a bit old :) If your horse was healthy and good physical shape, then you would be able to enter your horse for competitions! <br>  Good Luck and Best Wishes x|`|MUMnEKIlaa	As long as your horse is fit and well.  Take into account like older people their reflexes may not be so quick and it is always best to keep them fit. I made the mistake of giving my older horse who was 22 a break when I had my first child and he never got his form back. The spell seemed to age him. There are special feeds available for older horses in work and also a little flaxseed oil never goes astray for older animals.  Celery seeds can also help in their feed.|`|AA11036952	well,<br>  every horse is different and age will depend on horse.  but 18 is so not old my horse is 18 this summer ad he thinks he is 2 year old.  he can do everything anfd is fitter than all the others.  he has another 10 good riding years in him and then light hacking.  all being well and no illness. so your fine goodluck.|`|Pah3miTYaa	Hey :)<br>  We have a very fit and healthy 18 year old who is still able to jump and compete.<br>  Just keep an eye on his/her weight, condition, teeth etc. but 18 is fine as yet.<br>  Good luck with the competing and best wishes<br>  Sophie x|`|BkWYy72Faa	no. a horse at the yard i keep mine is early 30s and still enjoys eventing. a horse will tell you when they want to slow things down, as long your horse enjoys what you are wanting to do and is in good condition then go for it|`|PhAMcZZuaa	Most UPPER level dressage horses aren't considered fully trained until they are in their teens, so they are in their show PRIME at 18!<br>  <br>  Make sure your horse is conditioned for the task you are asking him to do, same as any age animal!|`|sX17XtVWaa	I think it's the best age for a horse.Out of the foolishness of youngsters and not really old.I'd be happy with that age.I've shown horses a lot older than that and they were fine.Good luck|`|7iaX5owbaa	i wuldnt enter her/him in competitons it will wear her/him down 2 much!but no i wuldnt consider her/him old....and alzo did u no that an older horz iz sweeter then a yunger horse!well hope i helpped u out a little!|`|m6kLApYPaa	As long as the horse is healthy then 18 isnt very old,<br>  ive got a small horse is now 29 and stills gets ridden, so tbh i dont think it matters what age they are as long as there healthy and happy (:<br>  x|`|1XngLDxyaa	No an 18 year old is not considered old in my book nor many others.

3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	It is partly to make them easier to brush in winter but the main reason is so that with a longer coat the horse will inevitably sweat more when working in the winter.  A long coat takes longer to dry and a damp horse in a draught is going to become a sick horse soon.  Removing hair from the under belly also makes it easier to see if there are any sores caused by mud.  On short hairs, the mud will soon dry and drop off or be easily removed by proper grooming.<br>  <br>  You will have noticed there are different styles of clipping.  That is usually consistent with the work the horse is doing.  A trace clip under the horses neck and belly is ideal for a horse who is mostly living out of doors, with a rug but will be doing some work in the winter.<br>  <br>  A blanket clip is good for a horse who is in fairly hard work but might also have to stand around a lot and wants to keep his back warm.  He can go out in the field too, on a fine day with rugs.<br>  <br>  A fully clipped horse is the hardest working of all, perhaps hunting, showjumping or racing and cleanliness and health of such a horse is paramount if they are to work well and comfortably.<br>  <br>  A full clip is also helpful as the horse is less likely to sweat so much therefore not require such a thorough grooming, though he will need to be rugged most of the time.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	People body clip their horse's for variety of reasons. Mostly you will find horses that are going to be in steady work throughout the winter will be clipped to prevent overheating and so it is easier to cool them down after a ride. Horses with very furry coats are also clipped so it is easier to deal with them in the spring. Some horses are even clipped just to look "fashionable".|`|gJE0ujbzaa	It does make them easier to clean, but that's not usually why people clip in the winter.  It is because when a horse has a heavy winter coat, if you work them much, they will often get very sweaty. In a warm climate, it's just very uncomfortable in them.  In a colder wetter climate,  since it's winter, with the cold and damp, they won't dry.  They will stay wet.  And will be likely to get cold and be uncomfortable, or get chilled and be more likely to get sick.<br>  <br>  When a horse gets wet from rain, generally the water hits the top of their hair, and runs off, and they don't get wet down to the skin. It works something like when we wear a raincoat.   When they sweat, the sweat comes from the skin, so the skin and all the hair gets wet. So they are wet completely through, just as we would be if we stood out in the rain without a raincoat on.<br>  <br>  You can't just put a blanket on a wet horse with winter hair, as the horse will not dry underneath for hours, even days depending on the weather.  They will stay cold and wet even with a blanket.<br>  <br>  If you clip them, they will sweat less, and they will dry quickly.  Of course, you will have to keep a blanket on them in cold or wet weather, since they no longer have their hair to protect them.|`|uec7RIhbaa	yes clips make a horse's coat easier to take care of in winter but the decision to clip depends mostly on the horses work load.  a horse in medium or hard work will sweat up under his thick winter coat, taking a long time to dry and cool down and can mean you can't work him as much as you want to.  a clipped horse will not sweat up so fast and will take a very short time to cool down so you can quickly re-rug etc and do not run the risk of him catching a chill.  A clipped horse will require rugs and probably to be stabled overnight in winter - there are many different types of clip - some take off just the neck and belly or chest whilst others will take off all the hair excepting (but not always) legs and/or head.  clips all have different names and are used in direct relation to the horses workload, living arrangements and type.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	no it is not because it is easer to brush its because if there coat is to thick in the winter they will over heat|`|OItPJZjBaa	I'm not sure what you mean by clip horses, but I would like to know. Sorry that I didn't really answer your question.|`|BkWYy72Faa	Clipping in winter allows a horse to work in comfort, the horses winter coat is designed for warmth and insulation, not cooling, so when a horse works hard this long coat becomes soaked with sweat, becoming heavy, uncomfortable and taking a very long time to dry out.  <br>  <br>  Clipping shortens the coat to a bit below its summer length, allowing quicker evaporation of seat, more rapid drying and easier grooming. So while clipping gives the horse and owner the freedom to continue their work minus the discomfort of long thick coats.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I am assuming you are asking about a body clip?  People do it in the winter if going to a show, or when you are training for performance it is nice to have the winter hair gone for the sake of cooling them down if they work up a sweat and for cleanliness.  You don't have all that hair retaining moister which can cause them to catch a chill and get sick.  The only thing is then you have to keep them well blanketed, hooded and a stall if it is cold were your are.  Typically done if you are using your horse alot in the winter.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question.<br>  Jenny|`|XX03Sd0faa	Body clipped is used to keep a horse from sweating too much in colder weather, when they would naturally grow a thick coat. There are many different types of clip - from a full body clip where all the coat is clipped, to simply clipping under the belly and neck. <br>  <br>  The type of clip depends on how intense their work load is, and also how they are kept. A full body clip would not be suitable for a horse that is only ridden lightly a few times a week and kept at grass, as it would get too cold. It would be far more suited to a horse kept in 24/7, that is rugged up and worked fairly intensely. <br>  <br>  There are other 'in between' clips such as a blanket clip which would be suitable for a horse that is exercised regularly, and turned out. <br>  <br>  A horse can also be clipped in other ways, such as trimming up the coat on legs, to keep the horse neat and tidy.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	You didn't say if you are asking about clipping manes, tails, around the hocks, the whole body or some combination of those.  What I can tell you is that for horses that are being shown, in some instances, the clipping is required for certain classes.  In other instances, it is done simply because it makes the horse look more neat, especially for halter classes.  For those who show year round in cold climates, surely they realize they either need a heated barn or they need to provide their horse with a blanket.  I hope that helps.|`|sX17XtVWaa	People clip to make it easier on them for grooming.It also makes it easier for taking on and off halters,snow removal on hoofs,etc.i don't clip alot in the winter,because they need all the protection from the frost.Horses have been known to have frost bite from their ears being clipped.Clipping is also done for showing.|`|AA11036952	horse only need clipped when doing a lot of exercise.  in winter when tyhe sweat alot with winter coat you have to sponge where sweated and it is better for horse to clip and avoid getting colds as you can rug up.  so it is to stop over heating in heavy work.|`|nuc5DBD8aa	To keep them cool and so they look nice in shows i guess.|`|penuzN8jaa	to keep them cool and look pretty<br>  x|`|BwUSAXxqaa	No. It depends on how you are clipping them. A hunters and a half clip is not like a full clip. A full clip is for a horse that is working everyday so needs a thin coat to cope with temperature and sweat when working. Half clip is when the horse is not working as much, or towards the start / end of the winter season. Note, you should NEVER clip horses that live outdoors, they will get too cold overnight.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|InxxEQvYaa	clipping does seem wierd at first- it still is to me even though i am a pro. They usually clip to make the horse more comfortable, in the summer. A clipped horse may have a thick coat, and in the summer it is easier for it to work if it isnt dying of heat stroke. lol|`|KmMUnZEDaa	the reason why people clip horses in the winter because when they are riding there horses the horse sweats really easliy with all that fur and makes it very uncomfortble for the horse also makes the horse look pretty too.|`|AB4aulGSaa	People clip there horses so they dnt get too hot in the summer and they look smarter for shows x<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped
DLxh9CANaa	You need to find out WHY Ava bucks, and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, before you try to sell the mare, because if you neglect to tell the potential new owners about this little habit she has and someone gets badly HURT OR KILLED, then YOU and your mom could be held LIABLE for damages in some states. You ALSO need to contact Ava's former owners, and inform them about what has happened, AND let them know that they can expect to hear from the parents of the girls who got hurt when the mare threw them. I would imagine that these girls' parents are MIGHTY MAD right about now, and in Sara's case, are most likely looking for someone to PIN THIS ON. If you are not careful, that someone could very EASILY BE YOU, or your mom, or BOTH OFYOU. As a precaution, I'd get yourself a good lawyer- if these girls' parents decide to sue you or your mom for damages and medical bills, YOU'LL NEED ONE, that's for sure. You are just extrordinarily LUCKY that no serious or permanent damage was done, and that Ava didn't succeed in KILLING one or both of these kids. <br>  <br>  This mare clearly has some discipline and behavior issues which need to be addressed, and she needs to be in the hands of a professional. She ALSO needs a thorough checkup and medical exam done by a good vet,  and it wouldn't hurt to have a chiropractor look at her back. Have you checked the fit of the tack as well, to see if it's pinching the mare or causing her pain in any way? Another thing- could something about the way the first girl, Rachel, was riding, have CAUSED the mare to go berserk and act the way she did? Is Ava "cold backed" or "cinchy" by any chance? What about Sara- when she got on the mare the first time, did she do it right after Ava threw Rachel, or was there a time lapse between the two events? ( If these two girls rode or tried to ride on different days, then that means that Ava received an unintended REWARD for her misdeeds. She got put back in her stall after misbehaving, and got away with it, which could easily have given her reason to do it again the next day.) You need to find answers to ALL of these questions, and see what the medical exams reveal, BEFORE you try to sell Ava to anyone.  If she checks out okay medically, then it's time to put her in the hands of a professional, preferably one with lots of experience in dealing with horses which are rogues. If Ava doesn't appear to be responding to attempts to rehabilitate her within a reasonable period of time, then I'd give some thought to her future, and start looking at ways for her to go to another place where she won't have to be ridden any more. If there is a vet school or research facility in your area, I'd give them a call and ask if they are accepting donations of horses for their program. Ava could also be sold as a COMPANION ANIMAL ONLY to someone who has an older horse which needs company. And if there is no other solution available, and a home cannot be found for the mare, you'll need to think about putting her down. ( There's a strong possibility that the parents of the girls who rode Ava and got hurt may actually DEMAND this of you at some point- and it wouldn't surprise me if they did. That's what happens in a lot of situations when non-horsey parents have a daughter or son who gets hurt while riding. The parents generally will BLAME the horse first, without regard to the real causes of the situation, whatever they may be. I'm an instructor myself, and I have seen incidents of this type happen repeatedly at different places where I've worked. This is a sad situation, yes, but it's the price we all pay for living in the most suit-happy society on the planet. ) <br>  <br>  Good luck to you- I wish I had better news for you. I hope that Sara recovers quickly. <br>  <br>  One other thing- I'd make a point of having your mom apologize to Rachel's and Sara's parents, and do the same thing yourself. This should NOT have happened, PERIOD, but what's done is done.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	Have a vet come down and check out your mare. (which you should have done BEFORE you purchased her) perhaps she has a back problem that you can have fixed. usually a deal like that where the price has dropped 13,000 dollars, theres a problem. or  maybe you are not experienced enough to handle a horse that is very spirited. after the vet  checks her out have a reputable trainer come and evaluate the horse for you.  if you get bad news from both the trainer and vet i would attempt to take the seller to court and TRY and get your money back.  you really cant sell a horse like that to someone else its not right....unless you give them full disclosure.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	You will just have to be honest and share with people that she bucks.<br>  There are people who are willing to work with a horse with bad habits and train them.  <br>  It is aways good to ask the owner to ride the horse for you before you purchase one.  And you are better off to find a well broke horse, she knows how to buck you off now so she will need alot of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Jenny|`|sX17XtVWaa	Maybe your horse isn't completely trained for riding.I would try and do the lunging thing again.Try the saddle for a while,get on and off for a while.I would try all over training.Then maybe you could sell her as a green horse.i still would be honest and saying about the bucking,until i got it under control.|`|5kUxkun3aa	the fact that you bought the horse for ￡13000 less than it was for sale for did not ring any alarm bells!!!|`|FcR8G8hPaa	To be blunt - this horse is going to be hard to sell in the current market. However, this does not mean that you have a unsolvable problem. It does mean thinking things through. Especially if you liked this horse and would like to keep her if you can get rid of the bucking.<br>  <br>  I will also have to point out that there should have been no way for a person mounted on a horse to get into aisle of your barn. If you failed to close the arena gate or mounted up in the barn, that was reckless and could open you to a lawsuit.<br>  <br>  I am going to assume that you, your mother, or someone other than the owner rode the horse before purchase and the horse seemed fine. I'm also going to assume that you had a basic prepurchase exam. If these are both true, then something has changed since you bought the horse, <br>  <br>  If you did not do this, then call the original owner and explain the problem and ask if they will come to your house and try to ride the horse so you can see if you are doing something wrong. If they are not willing to do this, ask them if they had run into this before and if so, what they did. It may be they were dishonest before, in which case you won't get an honest answer. But if they are honest, they will want to help their horse stay in a good home.<br>  <br>  A 15k horse sold for 2k might very well be being sold for the same reason you want to sell her - and since this is a training problem, it would be pretty sad if this horse keeps getting pushed off someone else when you could be enjoying her for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Before any of the following have a thorough vet check and include tests for Lyme disease. A friend of mine had a similar problem with a horse who turned out to be highly positive for Lyme.<br>  <br>  If it's not medical, it's training. Bucking is not an unsolvable training problem, although the more she bucks, the more her bucking is reinforced. I have personally worked with bucking horses and it is usually something that is fairly easy to delete, but you do need to be very experienced, especially with the level of bucking you describe.<br>  <br>  The first thing is to take a deep breath. And stop riding her. Not just because of the danger, but because she has successfully bucked off several people, and you can't afford more - every time she succeeds, it will make it harder to get rid of the bucking behavior.<br>  <br>  If the owner can ride the horse and no one you know can, you need to know if you are doing anything differently - saddle, bit, riding style, different cues, lighter rein pressure, use of spurs, no use of spurs... you get the idea.<br>  <br>  You also need to analyze the behavior of the horse on the lead line. Does she lead easily, does she lead straight, does she keep pace with you when you lead her, does she stop right away when you stop? Does she stand still reliably when asked? If not, this area needs your first focus to retrain. There's a lot to this, so ask a separate question if you need advice.<br>  <br>  If she spooky about objects, specific environments, tack, noises (even soft or distant ones) or people? If so, you need to habituate her to anything unusual in your environment.<br>  <br>  Does she lunge lightly and reliably, stay calm, and not bolt, kick out or buck, and stay at a controlled speed? If not, you need to work with her on the lunge line and delete the bolt, buck, kick out, and lack of speed control by forcing down transitions to the halt or the next lower gait with yanks of the lead line that don't stop until she does.<br>  <br>  OK, now when she leads well, stands well, doesn't spook and lunges with light control, you have a horse who may be all right to ride. But you will need to be careful, wear protective gear, stay near the center of the arena, minimize distractions and surprises, and stick with the walk while you make sure she's safe at that gait.<br>  <br>  Doing this yourself is difficult and risky and it requires patience and calm. You may prefer to find a professional horse trainer with prior success retraining a bucking horse. Get references and check them. Make sure you can come watch the training so you can be sure the trainer is working the horse and actually solving the problem. You may need to put somewhere from a few hundred to a thousand into this training, but that could be well worth it - it might make the horse able to be kept or it will help make the horse salable to a new good home if you don't want her even after that.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Please remember to do what's best for the horse's long term interests if possible.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your horse!|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Call the old owner and just say at this point we don't care if you over estimated what she is but we need to know the truth to see if this is a medical problem.<br>  Give them a chance to fess up.  You need to know.<br>  If you believe after talking to them that this is a new issue I would have the vet out.<br>  This could be a rib problem, neck problem, etc... that you don't see but is causing her pain.  When a rider is up she feels it and decides to get the rider off to relieve the pain.  Even if the vet does not find a reason you may want to consult with a massage therapist.  They would be able to find the sore spot if there is one. If she gets a clean bill of health it might be in your families best interest to send her to a trainer since if you sell her and she manes or kills someone they might be able to come back at you guys.<br>  It might only take one month of retaining to break her of this habit and well worth the money.  Hey you might get the horse you wanted anyway and decide to keep her after that.<br>  Good luck.  <br>  Kath
gJE0ujbzaa	Horses go through the "terrible twos" just like children do. And just like children, this is NOT the time to "put him in school". He's not physically or emotionally ready to be ridden.<br>  <br>  If he's misbehaving, it's ground work he needs. He needs to learn respect for humans, and he needs to learn the rules.  <br>  <br>  I always forget how much a stone is(Ireland is pretty much the only country in the world that uses that measurement as far as I can tell).  I think that's somewhere around 100 pounds.  You aren't too heavy, if you plan is to just sit on him and walk or trot around. But breaking him to ride is NOT going to "settle him down".  Giving him regular handling will.  Natural horsemanship techniques are very useful with a young horse who is a handful.<br>  <br>  If you plan on doing more than just sitting on him and walk/trotting, plan on possibly damaging him permanatly.  Research has shown that regardless of how mature a horse looks, NO breed of horse matures "faster" than another. The legs are actually the first area where growth plates close, somewhere between 2 and 4 years old. The neck and back stop growing last at 5 to 6 years old-meaning if you put weight on them too early, you can permanatly damage their backs.  This is one of the reasons so many flat racing horses are not good performance horses when they finish their racing careers.  It's because they were ridden too early, their backs and legs were damaged, and doing things like collecting and coming into the bridle correctly are painful or impossible for them.|`|uec7RIhbaa	it's best not to ride a horse under 3 or 4.  their bones and muscles are not yet developed enough and you may cause irrevocable damage to his future development.<br>  <br>  however, for the badly behaved horse there are things you can do - many of which will aid you in the future when you do decide to back him.  First of all you can bit him - get his bridle fitted and sorted and let him become accustomed to the bit.  some light lunging and even long reining is fine but remember that he should not do alot of strenuous work yet.  this stuff should teach him respect and will give you a head start for the future.  you can also do things like loose schooling or natural horsemanship and take him out walking in hand and spend plenty of time with him doing things like grooming or bombproofing (playing with plastic bags etc will help this!!)|`|SzW9GmRsaa	Plenty of people do it, but that doesn't make it right.<br>  <br>  Horses who are broken early have stress related injuries at a young age.  He won't be physically or mentally mature enough until he's four and you can cause a lot of damage if you ride him too early.  A lot of the time the damage isn't apparent for another 7-10 years so people think they've got away with it...<br>  <br>  Problems on the ground need to be sorted on the ground.  You need lot of patience and skill to raise a youngster, and trying to turn him into a ridden animal won't help you.  Go back to the basics and teach him how to lead, and be patient and consistent.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	If he is getting strong and behaving badly them riding him is not the answer.  You need to get a trainer for him.  If things are done incorrectly it will all just escalate.  There are soooo many things you can do with him on the ground before you even think about riding him.  You want to make sure he is safe and respectful before you ride.<br>  I would take care of all the first steps before riding.  And yes, you can work on getting on and off of a 21/2 year old but I would not recommend riding till a bit older three to four.  Could cause problems later.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|0rRkRAnJaa	I second see arr harr wholeheartedly.<br>  <br>  Do groundwork with your horse, you should have started this when he was a foal (or whoever had him before you should have done). From your question, I assume you've never done this before. Get a trainer or more experienced person to help you out because otherwise you'll end up with a ruined horse - even if your intentions are good.<br>  <br>  As for riding a young horse, I invite anyone to come and meet my 12 year old TB who suffers the problems of a horse more than twice his age because guess what? Someone thought it would be clever to back him at barely 2 years old. <br>  <br>  Some of the worst things come from the best intentions.|`|5kUxkun3aa	i would do loads of research into what ex racer end up like in later life. (it's not good.)<br>  why would baking him stop him from been bad behaved?<br>  if you want a horse at the end of the day with good shape and bones i would waite until its around 4 before you start putting a rider on,for any lengh of time.<br>  he needs ground work.leading and manners.<br>  don't let his life be boring give him something to think about.|`|22hMUxlHaa	No, it's not ok to back him. He may be strong but he is still developing and is too young to take the excess weight. Work with him to improve his manners on the ground. When he's three re-assess the situation.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	you should not ride a horse till they are 3 or 4<br>  <br>  you should start training a horse when it is about 2 but on the lead line|`|kwhfazx7aa	Hi,<br>  It is generally accepted (UK) that a horse can initially be backed a 2-21/2, however this is not breaking age once the horse has accepted the rider and is prepared to walk with the rider aboard with no problems the horse is usually turned away to mature and brought back at 3+ to break.  The more gradual the training breaking the better.  Too much too soon can cause major probs later.  I have a heavey cob that jumps, took well to schooling inc lateral and extended paces but due to him just being backed and hunted/shown etc at 3 can not be taken anywhere with lots of horses coz he goes mad bucking etc.  Sad but is great with kids scared of nothing hacking so you have to decide whats important.  Remember in Uk TB are broken for racing @ 2 but how many have a use after racing without serious work?  Ground work is important don't let him bully you at this age or you will have probs.<br>  Good luck take it steady and be pacient.  You have the makings of an ace horse.|`|XX03Sd0faa	I would say no. 2 years is the absolute minimum age to back a horse, and being crossed with a cob will mean your horse will take a longer amount of time to fully mature than a finer horse. <br>  <br>  Second of all, I would say get a trainer to help you, seeing as you don't seem to know a lot about youngsters. They need very consistent training and discipline, and if you think that simply riding a young horse will prevent bad behaviour, then you need help. You need to sort out any bad behaviour now before it esculates to a serious problem in later life.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Lead line training is more appropriate to start his foundations. The horse needs to reliably go, stop, stand and back up with light commands. If you don't have this in place, you won't do well saddling him.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest getting a good trainer to work with this horse - starting horses is a job for a professional.|`|AA11036952	i would say no, because his back isnt ready and you wont see the damage it does till later in years.  also your horse should be aleat 3 to start backing, but he should have started his ground work and mouthing him and long reining this will sort him out and give him some manners.  i know race horses race at 2 yr old but i really hate this becaues their backs is ruined in later life.  so mouth him now and long rein and even a bit of light lounging.  never over work a young horse.  well good luck and dont worry bout some of the answers we all have to learn sometime and thats how you learn is to ask.  so fair play on asking before you do it.  good luck|`|UeERt6yxaa	I think if he is really bad behaved but you are eager and comphident enough take him to schooling at a local riding school. They will help you if he is a stubborn one. Thats what I think. You seem a good enough weight and that horse sounds a bretty strong and tough one anyway. But I know were he gets the stubborn side from. The TB in him. But dont worry. Get advice about his behavior aswell.|`|AB4aulGSaa	umm.... some people do but its advisable not to as they are not fully grown as some horses grow differently like front a bit then back thts why a lot of yearlings are shorter at the front or vice versa just practice putting on a saddle and leaning over his back .... then the bridle and get some long reins and  attatch to a bridle u can then walk behind him (like ur teaching him to pull a trap) and go for a short walk everyday until he is about 3 - 3 and a half i knw its not ideal but i have seen  people do this (walk their horses - u get long reins and u have one at either side of the horse just like normal reins) this will surely wear him out and he will get used to the roads x<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x|`|PUspAGxFaa	if he is getting bad behaved he needs more ground work. riding him wont fix your problems. work with him in the round pen. try parelli or you can take him to a trainer. he should not be ridden until 2 1/2 and then only lightly until he is 4 Good Luck!|`|yjGuG33oaa	No .... he is not full developed at this point and you could damage his back, muscles, mental health and rest of his bones ... unless he is bred to be ridden at 2 years old i highly advise you not ...|`|LAXxaxAZaa	First of all, no. Second of all, you want to RIDE your badly-behaved 2-year-old to calm him down?! That's one of the worst ideas I've ever heard. The only thing that will come out of that is him being badly-behaved both on the ground and under saddle. Work on his manners, wait for him to turn 3, then start riding him.|`|uwrzB6Kzaa	its all a matter of opinion.<br>  <br>  some people are against backing a horse before its 4 or 5 years old but it depends on what you want to do with him.<br>  <br>  at 8stone you should be ok to back him at 2.5 years old but you dont want to let anyone else that is heavier ride him until he is at least 3 or 4 years old.<br>  <br>  if you back him at 2.5 years old you wont be able to do much with him than ride him in walk, trot and canter for about 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  if you ride him loads and do lots of cantering and jumping you could damage his back or legs for life so you do need to be careful with what you do with him.<br>  <br>  nothing is worse than an older horse with a badly dipped back because he was backed too early by someone too heavy for him.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Its never OK to ride a 2 year old horse, even if it is a fast "maturing breed" like a thoroughbred or quarter horse. You will start to see problems with his back and legs in the future if you start to do this, plus its cruel, he's only a baby!<br>  <br>  You shouldnt really break a horse before 4, let alone 2, its so cruel. Riding him is not going to settle him, only correct training will settle him, if you think riding is going to sort him out you dont know what you're doing!!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If you are considering backing him I am assuming he already knows to lounge quietly, long line quietly, is familiar with voice commands, understands how to move away from pressure and is accustomed to tack including a saddle and bit? If so, then I would say he is ready for you to start getting him used to a riders weight. Until he is three I would do nothing more than sit on his back and do a little steering at the walk. He won't even be finished growing until at least four years of age, so you definitely don't want to start stressing out his joints now!|`|sbB0TpGXaa	I break most of my horses out at two for light riding.  I keep my rides shorter,  At three I start riding them farther and harder though I wait until even older for hard work.|`|RloOJ43haa	NO. Too soon. Wait until he is 4 to back. <br>  <br>  Work on ground manners for now.
AA11992723	I would feed your dog Innova maybe with EVO can mixed in after he is an adult. (canned food is actually the healthiest type of dog food out of dry, can and semimoist that you can feed a dog despite contrary belief that can rots dogs teeth. dogs teeth get bad on kibble too if you dont take care of them)<br>  <br>  Anyway, EVO dry kibble was originally only intended to supplement a raw food diet. It is not balanced with it's protein, and your large breed dog should NOT be fed that high amount of protein as a puppy because he is still growing and will still be growing until 1-2 years old.<br>  Too high protein given to a large breed puppy will speed up the growth process and may increase bad joint issues later on in life. He shouldn't eat more than 25% protein. (evo has 42-45% protein).<br>  <br>  I think Taste of the Wild is a good quality brand, too. I like how it has a Bison and Venison formula, those proteins are probably much better than chicken because of how badly chickens are raised and full of chemicals and steroids.<br>  <br>  It's too bad you can't feed raw, but if you wanted to, you can feed 1/2 kibble and 1/2 raw, just make sure one is in the AM and the other in the PM so they aren't mixed.|`|I38WF5aFaa	You are looking at very expensive foods.  Good quality but overpriced.  Look into what mushers feed their sled dogs. For canine athletes quality food is very important.  When you're feeding a dozen or more dogs price is important,  too.  I don't know any mushers that feed EVO or Blue Buffalo.  I know several who feed Eagle Pack Power Formula,  none who feed the Eagle Pack holistic foods.  In my area the most popular foods among mushers are National,  Blackwood and Redpaw.  I have had huskies live to 16 and 17 years old eating National.  I have a 13 year old now that still goes on 60 mile training runs with the rest of the team. Don't get suckered into spending more money on dog food than you need to.  Better marketing doesn't mean better dog food.  It means more money out of your pockets.  If possible,  feed both of your dogs the same food.

Plus a portion of the money you spend on the food goes to shelters to help homeless dogs which is always a good cause to go with. Just be careful when switching your dog to any food. Do it gradually or they can get diarrhea or vomiting. Also, occasionally giving your dogs raw meat shouldn't hurt them.

Lastly getting him a girl dog and breeding his is the worse idea ever. WE DO NOT NEED MORE DOGS IN THIS WORLD!<br>  <br>  So, how to get him to stop? #1 Yes, getting him neutered will help.  Male dogs can smell a female dog in heat up to 50 miles away (hence more male dogs are in shelters picked up as strays!!).  Dogs who are not fixed may howl or hump things if they smell a female in heat.<br>  #2. It could be dominance (assuming he is fixed).  You want to correct him like you did when you were housebreaking him or teaching him anything.  Get him to stop (grab his collar and remove him, tap him on the butt) and tell him NO very firmly.  Once he stops and walks away then you say "Good Boy" in a happy voice.  Dogs learn more quickly with praise.|`|X0KaYUEWaa	This could be to do with a dominance thing!  if dogs OR bitches for that matter want to try and dominate you they will grab any part of your body ie legs arms.

Rw7gi86Naa	Unless you’re breeding your cat chances are you won’t know your cat is pregnant until she is well along in the gestation period. The mother doesn’t begin to bulge noticeably until a couple of weeks before delivery time. Here are a few signs and symptoms you may see if your cat is pregnant:<br>  - Nipples will begin to enlarge and become more soft and pink, (this is the #1 sign) <br>  - Weight gain, especially around the mid-section <br>  - Increase in appetite, this usually occurs close to birth <br>  - Some cats may become more affectionate than usual <br>  - Cats may also exhibit morning sickness <br>  - Nesting activity begins|`|GKUme2asaa	1. Make sure it is a female cat.<br>     2. Check to see if her nipples are larger. Around day 21, a pregnant female's nipples will often turn bright pink. If they are, she is pregnant. If not, wait another week, and check again. Some may not turn bright pink or become enlarged, but most will.<br>     3. Very gently run your hand over the surface of her tummy to see if you feel a sort of swelling and small lumps the size of walnuts. DO NOT put too much pressure on the lumps.<br>     4. When a cat becomes pregnant, her demeanor may change. Pregnant cats become very affectionate, and not all teeth and claws.<br>     5. Stand back and look at your cat's overall shape. From the side, pregnant cats frequently look a little swayback with a slightly distended tummy. From the top looking down at the cat, a pregnant cat's tummy is frequently distended slightly more than halfway from the neck to the tail. This look has been compared to the posture of a burro. If your cat's profile has changed from normal to burro, she might be pregnant.<br>     6.

But piggies are good at hiding their symptoms until the problem gets quite big so I would make an appointment asap. He sounds kinda constipated, so I'm thinking he could have some sort of blockage in there. Feel his stomach, is it swollen or abnormally hard or rounded? Because if so he could have bloat or an intestinal blockage, the vet should be able to remove the blockage and drain the gas or liquid from his stomach. On the other hand it could be like a parasite or something, tapeworm? ew Tapeworms live in the intestinal tract and they basically steal the nutrients from the animals food, if he's eating, but not gaining weight then it could be something like this. The vet could sort this out too. <br>  <br>  If he isn't eating at all, then you will have to syringe feed him to keep his digestive system moving. Guinea pigs can die if they do not eat for 6-8 hours because their digestive system needs to be moving continuously. So basically, you wanna get his pellets add a little hot water and mush them up until their like a mash. You them wanna put this mixture into a syringe and feed it to him. I find it easier to hold the pig against your stamch and tilt him slightly so you can put the syringe in his mouth. The easiest thing to do is place it in the side of his mouth and slowly syringe some in, not too much, becasue piggies cant throw up and you dont wanna choke him wait for him to chew it and keep doing this every few hours. If he's not drinking you may wanna syringe him water too. Also soft poops, like the ones they're meant to eat can be turned into a mash too in the same weigh, these are full of vitamins so if he's stopped eating his poops you may wanna give him some of these.<br>  <br>  It could be something really simple,my guinea pig Spike became quite lethargic and started having trouble pooping due to an eye infection, I know it sounds weird, his eyes were a tiny bit weepy but I thought that it was normal. After giving him the eye drops the vet prescribed he was as right as rain, and after looking it up online I found that eye infection can have the symptoms of a cold and stuff, so it really could be a number of things. So my advice would be to take him to a vet asap.
NkEHCHsOaa	Just do the food she is used to and maybe add a little meat fat to her diet.

You could add a little fat to it with eggs, meat fat, etc.  Just stick with the same diet she is use to.  Also, adding things to the diet for a short time may not be an option.  If she is used to plain dog food, then gets it with gravy on it to fatten her up, she may refuse to eat it without the extras!!!|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Speak to your vet, and stick with something easy to digest.<br>    <br>   The idea is not to make up for lost time and weight - it's to let her recover slo0wly and on her own time.  If she has been sick, the LAST thing you want to do is feed her anything with high fat that could throw her into a case of pancreatitis or bloat, either of which could kill her.<br>  <br>    The vet can give you some I/D, and will probably instruct you to mix it gradually with her regular food - and give her frequent small meals.<br>  <br>    Ask the vet, adn do what they say - and nothing else.|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Did you take her to the vet.

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi cmariex5,<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to read that your girl is having problems at the moment. You say that everything was fine up until this morning ? Have you checked the toenails on her back feet to see if they've been scuffed? I ask this as our old German Shepherd had symptoms very similar to you dog which sadly turned out to be canine degenerative radiculomyelopathy or cdrm. One thing we had noticed was that every now and then when he was walking, we would hear a slight scrape of his back feet, this was caused my him knuckling and his toe nails catching the ground instead of his pads. At first the vets diagnosed arthritis but after some months they found the true diagnosis to be cdrm. Sadly there is no cure for this and he got worse, 3 months after his diagnosis, we had him pts. The only good thing with cdrm is the fact that the dog feels no pain. <br>  I am not for one moment saying that this is the case with your fur baby as I am not a vet so I would not be able to say. What I am trying to say though is prepare yourself  for the fact that the news may not be good. Our old boy was 11 years old and was as fit as a fiddle previous to this. <br>  I do with all my heart hope that your girl is ok and that this is something and nothing. I hope you wake up tomorrow and she is back on all four feet, fit and able again, and I hope that you have many more years with her to come. Give your girl a hug from me and please let me know how she gets on at the vets if possible. <br>  <br>  (((((hugs))))) to you and your girl<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Any news on how your fur baby is today? All is well I hope.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I'd go to the vet now.

I think this is one of those things that warrants an after hours visit to the vet rather than waiting to see if it "persists".<br>  <br>  If you couldn't walk suddenly, you'd go to the doctor straight away wouldn't you?<br>  <br>  There could be several different causes, but best to investigate quickly for something that serious.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well.<br>  <br>  AFTER YOUR ADDITIONAL INFO:<br>  The vet being closed is not very relevant.  Most places have an afterhours emergency vet service of some kind.  What happened to your dog was serious enough to warrant at very least a phonecall to such a service.|`|AA12387863	My dog had that problem and after many tests at the vet, nothing showed as the problem.

Good luck!|`|ypBAdcHVaa	There is a alot of potential issues, torn cruciates, hip displasia, lumbar spine issues, to just general soreness. Until you can see a vet keep her comfortable a nice soft padding under her and food and water nearby. Do not give her any medications, unless directed by a doctor (they may interefere with medication a veterinarian may need to give i.e. asprin) Also use a warm pack on her knee and hips it may help, if she had any trauma durring your walk keep an eye on her, watch for swelling and painfulness or anything that seems provoke pain. You can use a towel under her back to help her go outside and urinate, kinda like a sling. Hope she is just sore and is back on her feet after some rest let us know.

So you are just getting the dog based on how ONE example of it looks? Do you KNOW if it was sold as a "tea cup" or could it have been a toy? Do you know that there is no such thing as a "teacup"? It's just a word used by puppymillers and bybs to jack up the price of their puppies. It's often applied to runts, puppies of runts, and premature puppies. Sometimes the breeders will just call all their dogs "teacups" (even though some may be larger than the standard calls for) and usually get away with it because the only people buying such dogs are uneducated and don't know any better.

Make sure you are getting your poodle from a reputable breeder... preferably from champtionship bloodlines.

Obviously, this 'teacup' poodle doesn't come from a reputable breeder.  Reputable breeders do not breed dogs that are outside of the ideal standard for the breed... and if they do get an offspring that is less than ideal, they make sure it is fixed before being sold.  <br>  <br>  But, to answer your question... yes, poodles are smart dogs and easily trained.|`|WiycCxpzaa	Love Herds is right in the fact that they are going to cost a pretty penny fixing all the problems that come along with a 'teacup' thing.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to adopt from the shelter or go to a reputable breeder.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	The ferret nation cage is very sturdy, but I would have a dedicated ferret room, in which the children aren't allowed in (until they are old enough to handle them correctly, with supervision).<br>  <br>  My three nieces (4 and under), live with us.  My room is the ferret room, and they aren't allowed in.  But, when my oldest was younger, I did allow her to pet one of my ferrets (mistake on my part); my niece accidentally squeezed Pixie, and all Pixie did was turn (I had presented her back to my niece) and look.  So, if you train them, they won't just bite.  It hurt Pixie (vet examine ruled everything fine, though), but she didn't attack my niece.  But, still, a ferret can get easily hurt, so it's best to just keep them separated (I've learned my lesson, believe me).|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Or maybe you should keep the kid out of the room the cage is in. The one level Ferret Nation isnt big enough to be a permanent home to ferrets. Also, are you aware that ferrets are not recommended if you have children?

If your kids unintentionally squeeze the ferret too much or pull their ears or tail a ferret will NOT be forgiving, and believe me a full strength ferret bite is not something a child will forget in a hurry.|`|7ZjloThDaa	The ferret nation cage is very sturdy but I would not let you son around it without adult supervision just to be safe. Ferrets that are taught not to bite usually are fine with children as long as there is adult supervision and the child is taught how to handle the ferret.

Since 9/11 the TSA tends to take misrepresentation pretty seriously.  It can also get you banned from all future air travel.<br>  <br>  Claiming a dog as a service dog when you aren't disabled or the dog isn't trained can cost you future benefits, such as social security even when you would normally qualify (ie when you retire).  In some states, like mine, it is also a criminal offense that can result in fines and/or jail time.<br>  <br>  In some states the fine is up to $20,000.  I won't name which ones.

Some airlines permit them, but they are not required to.<br>  <br>  Remember that the legal definition of service animal, the law that gives the owner rights to fly or visit other public places with that animal, applies only to people who are disabled and use fully trained service dogs.  While other animals may informally be called "service animals" they are not legally service animals unless they meet this definition.<br>  <br>  ---edit---<br>  <br>  Jail time in Missouri is up to a year.  I helped lobby for this law.<br>  <br>  Airlines are not required to permit SDITs (service dogs in training) in the cabin.  Federal law doesn't address them at all because the laws are written to protect the person with a disability, not the dog, and not the trainer of the dog.  Only fully trained service dogs, accompanying their disabled owner, must be permitted in cabin on a flight, and then only if it is possible to fit the dog on the plane.<br>  <br>  A German Shepherd can in fact fit in the foot space on an airplane, provided the dog is trained to curl up small and stuff his butt in the underseat storage of the seat in front.  (Bulkhead isn't always the best choice for a larger dog because you may need that underseat storage area.)  I've done it many times with my German Shepherd service dog.<br>  <br>  Naturally real service dogs are trained to tuck their tails in so as not to be a hazard to others or to cause injury to themselves from being stepped on.

It IS illegal (fraud) to pass off your dog as a service animal when it is not.<br>  <br>  You cannot obtain a service dog certificate without having a legitimate disability that affects your quality of life and ability to get by.<br>  <br>  There is not a size limit on dogs on planes.<br>  <br>  There ARE specifications of where the dog can be.  I have an SDIT (Service Dog In Training) that is a German Shepherd Dog.  Since my dog does not fit in a carrier that could go under an airplane seat (duh), my dog and I must fly in the bulkhead of the plane (preferred and enjoyed since I don't have to sit next to anybody).  He curls up in the bulkhead and I just put my feet on the wall over his body.  <br>  <br>  I do my best to make sure his tail stays out of the aisle, but the flight attendants are very considerate and make sure to ask me if he's "all in" so they don't roll over his tail with the refreshment cart.|`|k6hZGdr7aa	You will need more than just a vest and a patch to be allowed to have your dog fly with you in the cabin.  And I am pretty sure there is a size limit anyways, so if you have a german shepard for a seeing eye dog, they would probubly have the dog below and have an attendant assist that person until they could get their dog back.  Only small dogs (like a toy breed) are allowed in the cabin and only if their are in a doggie carry bag.|`|tY14vbrKaa	I'm not certain if it's illegal, or just highly unethical.  I do know, that if you purchase the "service dog" apparel, and ANYTHING happens involving bad behavior, injury, or destruction to property, you will be fully liable, and are likely to suffer criminal charges.|`|h7N0BGfRaa	yes its not legal at all, and this is to keep people from doing just what you are trying to do and ruin it for the legitimate service dogs and people who need them.  They fought for that right, and I hope you get put in jail if you attempt it. Those dogs earned the right to wear that vest.|`|muPiBQ3Uaa	Currently, there are no Federal laws in regards to this, but there are certain State statutes that make the misrepresentation of a non-service dog as a service dog a prosecutable crime. Missouri, for example, has a law where there is a $1000 fine and 1 year jail time for faking a pet as a service dog. In California, it is a misdemeanor that carries up to a $2500 fine and 1 year in jail, plus a criminal record for life. Not all States are the same, but most all have some law about faking a pet as a service dog. It is like faking an injury to get a handicapped parking permit. If they get caught, yeah---theres penalties to pay. If they dont get caught-----they still have to sleep well at night knowing that they lied and that they have dishonored all truly handicapped folks by their actions. Gives one something to think about.<br>  <br>  All of the internet "service dog registries" are just charlatans and con-artists who use ignorance and gullibility to bilk folks out of their money, in exchange for some "official" service dog certificate that isnt even useful for toilet paper. None of the so-called "certificates" will stand up in a court of law as proper evidence of training, need and usefulness. But---they sure make a lot of money while they are doing it.<br>  <br>  And most airlines, with advance notice, will allow a properly behaved SAR dog in the cabin anyway, so it is really a moot point.|`|PM23RDycaa	If your animal is NOT a service dog and you pas it off as one it is fraud and you will be fuking up the system for people who actually do have and need service/therapy/assistance animals.<br>  <br>  As far as I know you can't get service dog certificates WITHOUT going through the training.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	It is illegal, immoral and unethical.  <br>  Service dogs get special privileges because their owners need them.  Not because they think they are special and above the laws.  You cannot "obtain" a service dog certificate unless your dog is certified with from a legitimate entity and you have a doctor's cert that you need a service dog for a legitimate disability.  <br>  <br>  Many people have put a lot of time & effort into getting laws passed for access for legitimate service animals.  It is unconscionable to fraudulently use their hard work for your own selfish purposes.|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes.. that is fraud.<br>  <br>  The airline will ussually want some kind of documentation from a Dr stating that the dog is a service dog.. there are so many rules and regulations regarding flying pets, they need documentation on everything.  Someone may get away with the false Service dog vest at a store, restraunt or other public transportation because documentation is not required..  but airlines do require it.<br>  <br>  There is no techinical certification for service dogs.. if you have a disability, you can actually train your own dog, or hire a trainer.  Its very hard to proove that someone has a "fake" service dog, but like someone said, should you have an incident, such as the dog bites someone, you will be discovered in court.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also as far as service dogs on planes.. the dog must be small enough to ride at your feet or on your lap, otherwise, the animal still must ride as cargo in a carrier..  it is unsafe for other passengers and the stewardess to have a large dog laying in the ailse..  the only thing is that there is no health cert. required for service animals, and the fee is waived.<br>  <br>  The airline has to accomodate for the disabled passengers "within reason".|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Well let me tell you if you think you are going to get on a plane with a dog and try to pawn it off as a service dog, forget because airlines will ask for service training papers, and health certificates and other paper work and if you cant  provide it well then expect to have sky Marshall's called on you and to be arrested.<br>  <br>  By the way how do you plan on obtaining these items|`|24CFl7sjaa	If it's not, it should be.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I don't think it should be a felony, although anything involving planes is always serious, but it also shouldn't be legal.  It's not a service dog.  You're lucky you don't need a service dog.<br>   Your question reminds me of a joke:  Two friends meet each other while walking their dogs.  They'd like to get a drink or two together, but the local bar doesn't allow dogs.  The first guy gets an idea.  He puts on dark glasses and walks into the bar with his German Shepherd, like it's a seeing eye dog.  The bartender doesn't question him.  <br>  So, the second guy puts on sunglasses and walks into the bar.  "Hey," the bartender says, "You can't bring that dog in here."  The guy replies, "But it's a seeing eye dog."  "That's no seeing eye dog," the bartender says, "That's a chihuahua!"  <br>  "They gave me a chihuahua?!!" the guy replied.<br>  Edit:  What the hell was your point, then, justsayin?  People took the time to answer what was a pretty stupid question, and you call THEM fools?  Nice.
DtkLsetkaa	Its safe at any age, but they may not have much interest in it if they are too young.  Mine are about 6 months old and have no interest in it.  Just remember, anything in moderation ;))|`|VDP3pNCPaa	There are two situations to be considered.  First, is that few will show any interest in catnip until after the age of three months.  The second is that catnip sensitivity is genetic;  so if both parents are sensitive to catnip, then the kitten will have a 3 in 4 chance of being sensitive.  If only one parent is sensitive, then only a 1 in 2 chance.<br>  <br>  It is the volatile oils within the catnip that cats are responding to, so keeping the catnip in the freezer or refrigerator will keep it potent longer.  Of course, if it was stored in a hot warehouse before you got it, then that is out of your control.|`|O7Gkyk0zaa	LOL, any age is fine :)<br>  <br>  However, my cat is 10 and he didnt seem to have any intrest in it since we got him...lol|`|2qRaprunaa	my cat nip says --safe for all ages.<br>  <br>  <br>  let your cat freak out!!!!!!!<br>  its always worth the chuckle!!!|`|4l5XhmQvaa	i cant give my cat any of that again... he freaked out on me lol
5ojgFcmGaa	me too. try to see if there is an ASPCA(The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)near you. They fight against animal cruelty. I think you can volunteer  at their shelters. It's so wonderful to see mistreated animals get adopted and start again with a new loving owner.<br>  <br>  <br>   Best of luck to you!|`|XavY3fiWaa	I volunteer at a humane society and it is the best thing i have ever done.  Try finding a shelter near you and ask them about volunteering.|`|PnZlFQeOaa	Your local shelter is a great place to start.  Most of the animals there are strays, but many times they receive animals that have been removed for reasons like abandonment or abuse.  Volunteering helps the people who are trained to help these animals and in return you will get the training to better assist.  <br>  <br>  I have a large family and work full time so for me it would be difficult to take time out and go to a shelter, but I have found that fostering dogs for rescue groups is better fitted to my lifestyle and rewarding for both my family and the animal in question.  Check out some of the online rescue organizations.<br>  <br>  Preventing is difficult in that to prevent you would have to be omnipotent.  Unfortunately that's not going to be possible, (sometimes I wish I could be a super hero and catch all of the people who do this) but through organized groups like rescues and shelters that have ways to reach the public, they (with the help of volunteers) can educate the masses to cruelty cases.
gGQssXS1aa	This is a really difficult one! If you say he has never been frightened or been in any fights at the park.<br>  Maybe he is in some sort of pain and does not feel like running about in the park.<br>  Or maybe he hurt himself at the park and associates the park with the pain. <br>  Dogs are very stoic where pain is concerned and sometimes it is hard to tell if they have pain or not.<br>  Try taking him to a different place for his walk and see if he acts just the same.<br>  If he continues to behave strangely have him checked over by a vet for any back trouble etc. Good Luck.|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	at one time people took their kids to the park,now they can't cos of all the dog cr*p everywhere,give your pooch a pat on the head maybe he's feeling guilty, unlike their owners.|`|qyMc5yOFaa	hes probly getting old or try bringing some of his fav treats out whit u and try spending more time with him and ask 1 of ur m8ts who has a dog to go with you and see if he acks diffrent|`|9SSO454taa	maybe you made him lazy by taking the car to the park all the time he might be out of shape walk him around the block a few times. unless there is a bigger dog in the park that picks on him. He might be getting bulled by another dog.
TZT0SCZSaa	You need to have your cat examined by your vet asap.  You need to know what caused this so you can know whether or not it is a threat to her vision in the other eye.  Cats can do well with only one eye, but it takes special care to have one that is blind in both eyes.  The problem could be glaucoma in one or both eyes, something systemic like a stroke or blood clot, a trauma to only one eye, you just don't know.  But you want to protect the other eye if you can!|`|DtkLsetkaa	Your cats eye has stopped responding to light stimulation, which means it is going blind (or is already there) in that eye.  Take him to the vet to have everything checked out, but this is most likely the cause.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	For my cat when that happened we took her to the vet and it ended up she was blind.  It was funny because she still got around the house like she used to, just a bit slower which we attributed to being old, not blind!|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	vet.<br>  <br>  in humans, and i assume cats, that is the warning sign of trouble, like brain damage or stroke.<br>  <br>  could also just be he is blind in that eye.
h7N0BGfRaa	a large quantity of chocolate may be really harmful for the dog and may even kill the pet. Chocolates contain theobromine, a stimulant found in the cocoa bean which is what is harmful to the animal. Theobromine is not to be confused with caffeine as it does not contain caffeine and is not as useful for a rush that a cup of coffee gives you during a late night preparation for an examination.<br>  <br>  The two animals that are greatly affected by theobromine are dogs and horses. Theobromine acts as a boost in horses and as such is a banned substance in horse racing. Unlike dogs, horses can put up with a higher quantity of chocolate since it is a bigger animal.<br>  <br>  A small piece of chocolate may not make any visible impact on dogs unless of course the animal eats something else while 'high' on chocolate.|`|zzGNsjUOaa	The dogs find it hard to digest. If it swallows a large amount, there is a high risk of it getting stuck in it's gut. One crumb of chocolate wont kill it but never feed it any. There is special dog chocolate without any harmful chemicals in it and stuff to prevent indigestion.|`|4yZ6t2WEaa	Apart from crying the dog may vomit and may have diarrhea also|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Chocolate contains a chemical called theobromine that a dog cannot process as well as we can. Theobromine can cause symptoms as mild as vomiting and diarrhea and more serious ones like heart arrhythmia, seizures and death.|`|KxjUim7yaa	There are a number of things beside chocolate that are bad for dogs, grapes being one. Chocolate is bad because of theobromine. It can cause: vomiting,diarrhea,hyperactivity, tremors, seizures, racing heart, and death. The fat in a chocolate bar can cause pancreatitis, a painful and serious condition.|`|K2jjYfTWaa	Though chocolate may not be as poisonous as cyanide for dogs, the fact remains that a large quantity of chocolate may be really harmful for the dog and may even kill the pet. Chocolates contain theobromine, a stimulant found in the cocoa bean which is what is harmful to the animal. Theobromine is not to be confused with caffeine as it does not contain caffeine and is not as useful for a rush that a cup of coffee gives you during a late night preparation for an examination. <br>  <br>  The two animals that are greatly affected by theobromine are dogs and horses. Theobromine acts as a boost in horses and as such is a banned substance in horse racing. Unlike dogs, horses can put up with a higher quantity of chocolate since it is a bigger animal. <br>  <br>  A small piece of chocolate may not make any visible impact on dogs unless of course the animal eats something else while 'high' on chocolate. However, large doses of chocolate may make the dog’s system purge the theobromine that is damaging to the animal. Apart from crying the dog may vomit and may have diarrhea also. Other symptoms of large doses of chocolates are increased urination in the animal and muscle twitching and excessive panting. <br>  <br>  However, the dog may not die from these symptoms. They are just warning signals. If one ignores those symptoms and does not take the animal to a vet eventually its heart may beat too fast and can give out. This is especially so in older dogs. Usually the increased heartbeat may follow the initial symptoms, when the excessive theobromine gets absorbed into the blood stream. Hopefully now you know why chocolates are not meant for dogs. It could kill the poor animal, put it in a comma, or cause seizures. Be careful!!|`|H1tokn4uaa	In basic terms, chocolate kicks up their heart beat so its like us drinking six Monsters, three Rockstars, and a Red Bull.  Their heart beats so fast they die.  When their heart beats that fast, it's what they call a toxic level.  Just to let you know, onions, grapes, raisins, and macadamia nuts can rise to a toxic level as well so be careful what types of people food your dog gets into.  If you want a delicious substitue for chocolate, try carob.|`|7Ox0nYH7aa	caffeine and theobromine in chocolate stimulate the heart,causing serious and often fatal arrythmia's.the first person is wrong,chocolate DOES contain caffeine as well as theobromine-i have a degree in dietetics as well as a nursing degree.|`|AA11244754	research it yourself as this it not really research because you have others doing the work for you; just type into your search bar foods that are bad for dogs
Bw18seFqaa	in the next few months you may be able to tell.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you can take a good guess by the shade of blue..  this isnt always accurate tho.  If the eyes are a light blue, they will probably stay blue..  if they are a darker blue- to maybe a bluish grey.. they will most likely turn brown.|`|3EaFjsA8aa	All puppies have blue eyes.

51St5GEcaa	don't you have to kill them to get their pelts? I've never heard of someone shearing a mink.

AA10776535	Here i have seen trainer say 500 to 600 per month, your horse stays with them so this includes feed and whatnot's.

But in the long run, it is well worth it, because you dont want a horse with lots of problems, because you didn't want to spend the little extra money.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|I1nP4a4Naa	Well, since she's an Arab, you need to have a trainer break her. Make sure she's 3+ yrs though!!  Look on the internet of what type of training you want her to have. I'd prefer english cause of her breed, but it's up to you. Just look some up in your area..<br>  <br>  hope this helps,<br>  ~Journey|`|3BMBZtDxaa	It really varies by the area. I know in my area for a good trainer to fully break your horse and do it well and correctly, it's about $800 a month. That includes the board, grooming, feeding, training, etc. And they usually get worked everyday.<br>  <br>  In this scenario, horses are usually there for a good 2-3 months. Sometimes longer if you plan on showing her. <br>  <br>  Basically you're looking at about $2,000 for this. More or less depending on your area and how long it takes them to break her.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	okay. well first off. she is scared because she is using her instinct side of her brain. she needs to be intriduced to her thinking side. and to do this, you need to walk. walk backwards, forwards, sideways, and well everywere. dont ride her yet. just walk around with her. walking for an hour or so will help her use her thinking side. when you first put the saddle on her, let her buck the bucks out of her, then, walk some more. you need to WALK. incase that wasnt clear lol:)  watch some clint anderson stuf. thats wer ei got all of this info from. a horse trianer can green break her for about $400 or $500 for about 4 er 5 monthes|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Ask the Vet for recommendations.|`|KFXjRpnFaa	I would definitely hire a trainer.<br>  It'll cost more if you do it wrong and have to have her re-trained. Also you could get injured if you do it wrong. You can either send her to a trainer to do it all for you (depending on the quality of the trainer determins the price) or if you want to do it yourself then you can get a trainer out to help you with the initial getting on and then give you some lessons. Remember, if you do it yourself without experience in starting horses, she will not understand anything you ask. Squeezing with your legs will mean nothing to her, as would using your reins. You may end up confusing her, probably resulting in a very unresposive horse and a few injuries on your behalf. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get on well and its a very rewarding experience to start a young horse, but please get a helping hand with it for you and your horse's sake :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps.<br>  :)|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I think it's wise for you to have an experienced trainer break your filly.  I have worked with a lot of young horses, but I still don't feel I'd have the experience needed to break a youngster completely on my own.  I think the best thing to do would be to shop around in your area, and ask around at good local barns to see if they have a preference or if they can refer you to someone.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Emily,<br>    It would depend.  You really need to call around and check out your potential trainers.  I would look for one who works with Arabians regularly.  I have had alto of experience with Arabians and they are a sensitive breed.  They are alot different then say a TWH for example.<br>  You are probably looking at around 600.00 a month for full care/board and training or so depending on where you live.  And you will need to ask how much they will charge you for lessons for yourself to along with her training.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Jenny|`|5kUxkun3aa	its hard to set a price. some will come to you. or board your horse. even if you send it away ask to go and watch. and when it has been backed.ride it with the trainer. then have lessons with  instructor so you have someone keeping a eye on what you are doing. that will stop problems before they start. good luck|`|sX17XtVWaa	if you never done it before and your not sure.Get someone who has done it before.It's better than wishing later when you have bad habits to try and fix.Good luck|`|bKwQyCEHaa	have a horse trainer teach you how to break a horse|`|RqcLxDesaa	And while you're at it, lessons for yourself would not be a bad idea. Learn with your horse. Good luck!|`|40EotGSlaa	get a horse trainer! lol|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I would get a trainer. I charged around $600 for 30 days but in that $600, I included board, feed, bedding, and farrier/vet plus the training. Some may charge extra. But I also live in the Midwest in the USA so things are cheaper here than other places. It depends on your area. Make sure you look around at different trainers and see what they do, find one you like and can afford. Good luck!|`|3GeJ50SWaa	Depending on the trainer and their experience with horses. I have seen some up to $800 a month and others around $300 a month. On the other hand try a lot of ground work with her first then if she trusts you, it might not take much to get her used to a little weight on her back. Where are you located? OH area?|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Please do find a trainer. The horse's foundation training is critical for her future and should be done by someone who's done many of these before. Otherwise, this horse could be ruined for life.|`|D7b8pFMraa	Depending on the trainer it can range from 300.00 to a couple thousand. I you are renting a stall (not your own barn) ask your barn owner if she has any suggestions. :0)|`|amJ7EcD1aa	Look up Pat Parelli. He's great! <br>  Parelli.com
BMri9tITaa	I'd boil them and brush them off, but yeah, that should be fine.  It would look lovely, too.  :)|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Not unless you have fish that live in very alkaline conditions. The shells and rocks will alter the pH of your pond and possibly introduce chemicals and/or bacteria that came from where you found them. If you're looking to get some rocks then an aquatic, pet or landscaping store is the place to go.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	I assume the pond has some size to it, not like a indoor tank. Rocks should be okay, drop some vinegar on one and if it sizzles, then no. you don't want any porous rock because it will release it's chemical makeup into the pool and that could throw your ph off. I'd stay away from shells-they release calcium.|`|DkA3xaHOaa	This will be fine if they are igneous stone however sedimentary stone will have absorbed a certain ammount of salt.|`|pSymjiFxaa	yeah i think you can do that|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Yes, I've done it. I never boiled them, I just rinsed them well.

They're cute!|`|TtlAvosfaa	hahaha what a freaky coincidence, I got a tank and no heater! I just got it today because I am getting a goldfish sunday. You should either get a goldfish or a beta because they are both good fish and you don't need a heater for them. With gold fish, you can get as many as you want, but with betas, only one because they are Japanese fighting fish and they will fight out of instinct. Good luck and I really hope I helped!|`|OdDbR4Psaa	Please make sure that your tank is cycled before you put any fish in. This simply means running your tank with the filter for at least 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  You can get either 3-4<br>  <br>  * guppies<br>  * zebra danios<br>  * small tetras<br>  * white cloud minnows... or<br>  * dwarf rasboras<br>  <br>  If you want to avoid reproduction and other problems, just get fish of all the same sex|`|dE5fs9yzaa	No heat...no tropical fish. Goldfish will do okay except you didn't say if you have a filter or not. Remember, you are getting a living being...it needs to kept comfortable for a healthy life.

hIyjdXr9aa	Your fishtank is cloudy because you did not cycle it.  Also, there is a rotting cucumber in the water.  Removing uneaten vegetables within a day of placing them in the tank will prevent the water from becoming cloudy.  To feed fish vegetables, you actually have to steam the veggies to make them soft and then cut them into very very tiny bits.  Remove any bits that are not immediately eaten or they will rot in your tank.  <br>  <br>  Yes, you need to feed your silver dollars flake food.  The pet store person was, I'm sorry to insult him or her, but not very smart.  Fish need a well balanced diet and you should feed the silver dollars a variety of foods to keep them well nourished.  This includes fish flakes, freeze dried and live food like worms or shrimp, veggies, and you could even try an algae wafer (the kind they make for plecos and herbivores).  The more variety you put in your fish's diet, the more well nourished it will be.<br>  <br>  Buy an ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate testing kit and monitor your ammonia levels.  If the ammonia gets too high, do a partial water change.  You should cycle your next aqurium before putting fish in it.

3KvdQZ62aa	Dog do cry, they weep  they have feelings like u and me. If yuor dog does cry spend time with it. My rabbit chews through electrical cords 2. Put up bonders, or every time your dog chews it send it into the batheroom for 15 mins then let it out. Keep it ocupied so it doesn't think about chewing cords. Your dog problys chews cords because ti has nothing else to do keep it busy feed it well and it should become happy. If yuor unable to play with it get it a play mate(another dog). THis play mate will keep her busy when your at school or at work.<br>   Hope this helps!!|`|p6rVGiZ9aa	Yes he was crying. But if you really want to stop him from chewing cords you have to show him what it feels like to get shocked. So if he chews on a cord just get a tazer and walk towards him and he will be like DON'T TAZE ME DUDE and DUDE DON'T TAZE ME and then you hit him with the voltage and if he lives then he won't chew again.|`|43d7bcd8eb6978e1af38224038c541f3aa	Dogs don't have tear ducts.

He probably had a very sad look in his eyes as he was being punished.  You NEED to work on this behavior so he does not get ahold of one that is plugged in.  This could electrocute him, possibly even burn down the house!|`|ZzoOl8xYaa	yes he was, thats sad|`|RwQmN7Reaa	He wouldn't actually have tears from being sad. It could have just been something that got into his eye or some other kind of infection. Keep an eye on it and if you notice that it looks wet and weepy then have it looked at by a vet.

ZVYY7nOlaa	Black skirt tetras might work. they are large tetras.<br>  There are lots of schooling fish:hatchets, zebra danios, white cloud minnows, cardinal tetras, but they will probably get eaten by all your big fish.

There's a lot of tetras so you can really pick and choose.  I don't think knifefish eat other fish.
zqVDJxUIaa	Because you cleaned the filter, you probably destroyed the beneficial bacterial colonies established there. In other words, from a biological point of view, your aquarium is starting from the beginning and it has not been cycled. Never clean your filter when your aquarium is just starting. Anyways, here's the steps you should take to resolve this:<br>  <br>  1. Every day, change 20-30% of the water and vacuum the gravel<br>     (any more and it could harm the fish, remember to use a tap water <br>      conditioner, as always)<br>  2. Use some ammonia remover in your filter (or add to aquarium)<br>  3. Consider using a biological supplement such as Hagen's Cycle to establish beneficial bacterial colonies.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your aquarium!|`|hFU31zm7aa	put a ammona  remover in they filter 6$ at petsmartif u have goldfish they give out tons of ammona and need alot of gallons to there self.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	If you have fish in the tank, do 1/3-1/2% water changes at least daily while your tank cycles.   Do not change the filter since you just dumped out a lot of your beneficial bacteria (which lives in your filter).  The driftwood too probably held a lot of good bacteria.  Do not use any more Ammo Lock.  Just do the water changes and let your tank settle down again and the good bacteria--it'll take a while so do daily (or twice daily) ammonia/nitrite tests and do water changes to keep the level acceptable for your fish.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Over feeding my friend.<br>  <br>  Wish you hadn't cleaned the filter, but never mind.<br>  <br>  Your 50% water change; you should have took from amongst the gravel, all you have done is stir up the bottom and cause an infusoria bloom.<br>  <br>  You can put the driftwood back in, that doesn't matter, it has a slightly positive effect, but not enough to get excited about.<br>  <br>  Do another 50%, this time with the gravel vacuum and remove the rotting cr@p. Then do a 20% the next day followed by 10% daily for a week. Leave the test kit alone, the tank is cycling, the results don't mean anything. Wait a week before testing again, the filter needs to break in.<br>  <br>  Edit: Foggy means infusoria - airbourne bugs that feed on a water food source - combined with ammonia and nitrate spike, you can do what you're told or kiss your plec good bye, you have dirty water and the source must be the gravel or the ammonia would have crashed after the water change. I'm not guessing :o)|`|qeOlkRM0aa	How old is the tank?<br>  did you cycle it? I'm guessing no.<br>  Do you have fish in it yet?<br>  You are going to have to let it cycle (or recycle). There's not much you can do. The fogginess is nitrifying bacteria . When the ammonia and nitrite disappear, so with the cloudiness.
AA11776611	I fed All Life Stages for a long time and I have 4 dogs ranging in size from 3 lbs to 110 lbs. They all did great on in until by big boy developed a grain allergy. Canidae wasn't making grain free at the time so we switched to Taste of the WIld. Grain free is the way to go IF you can afford it. Like it staes, the difference is, no grain is used in the ingredients, like wheat. If not, Canidae All Life Stages is great food as well. = )|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Dogs are carnivores and should eat only raw meat, bones, and organs.<br>  www.rawlearning.com|`|a253156796b88448d1ead50a3bca4698aa	A good dog dog food contains no corn at least one that doesnt have Corn listed as one of the first 5 ingredients.

tY14vbrKaa	1.  Yes, it's good that you're building a new fence.  Some organizations will deny an adoption simply because of lack of a fully fenced yard.<br>  <br>  2.  They will not dig in your yard.<br>  <br>  3.  They might go in your garage, but I'd simply say "the dog will never be in here."<br>  <br>  4.  It's not a housekeeping contest or a home decorating contest.  It's a visit to see how you live, and where you live.  For example, do you smoke?  Do you have fancy new white carpet and a new leather sofa?  Are you prepared for those things to be ruined?<br>  <br>  Here's some tips.  <br>  Be yourself and be honest.<br>  Make sure you have nothing up against your new fence (like wood piles) so there's no risk of the dog climbing up, and out of your yard--newly adopted dogs are not bonded, and given a change to leave, they often do.<br>  Clean up, but don't obsess.<br>  Explain times when you've already raised a dog to be happy and well behaved.<br>  Be honest about the amount of time the dog will spend alone, and the provisions you will make for the dog during that time.<br>  And relax, have fun, be excited.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|q0vKbocHaa	basically a home check is to make sure you take care of your house and stuff.

Also tell the adopter that you are going to build a fence.|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	they are mostly looking for things that could be a threat to the dog they look for wires the dog could chew on chemicals they might have access to possibilities for escape  anything that could pose a threat usually they will give you an evaluation and give you a chance to fix it they want your adoption to succeed so they will give you every chance|`|MpNCNQU5aa	just baby proof the house. look for things that the dog could chew on that should not be chewed or put into his mouth and put it up were he cant get it<br>  clean your house to show them you are responsible.<br>  no they wont dig in your yard. thats a violation.<br>  i dont know about them going in the garage. i dont think they should bc usually the garage should be off limits b/c that is were most of the poison goes for the car and stuff to makes cars work   ;)<br>  in the yard you should make sure there is no poison or anything sharp or small that could hurt the dog.|`|wGOtDZ0Uaa	sounds as if you have most things covered. just make sure that you<br>  have no old wires, nails etc lying about outside also don't be tempted<br>  to creosote the new fence, poisonous, make sure you have all the<br>  exit's to any road covered, assure them that the dog will not be left<br>  outside for hours also that the dog is not going to be left home alone for<br>  long periods of time , this must be priority as a lot of places will not<br>  re- home to people who work. Hope all goes well.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Make the appointment for when the fence is finished or almost done.<br>  Take away any item that is poisonous ie. if you have vermin rat poison can be fatal.  <br>  <br>  I've never heard of them digging in a garden.  Usually they come round, look at the size of the garden & make sure it is fenced off appropriately & secure so dog cannot escape.  Then they go around the house doing a simliar sort of thing.  <br>  <br>  I would remove all papers & books from the tops of tables or chairs & hide any sweets or chocolates.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you point out to them where the food bowls will be going, where his bed will be & think about how you will keep him entertained when you go out without him. ie. to work.  <br>  <br>  Try going on the internet & research the breed.  You could also try contacting the rescue centre & investigating the possiblity of meeting another owner of the breed & arranging a visit to their home to see what they do.  Good luck.  I'm sure everything will be fine.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Just clean your house and yard like you normally would.  As for the dog being outside by himself, even for an hour or so, it's best to promise the rescue that you won't do that.  Then stick to it.<br>  <br>  No, they won't look in your garage.<br>  <br>  When the rescue came to our house, we just cleaned it like we normally would and didn't worry about anything.  We got the dog a week later.<br>  <br>  They just want to make sure the dog isn't being sent to a dungeon.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Don't stress, they aren't going to go digging in your yard. They just want to make sure your home is ready for a dog. If you passed the in-person visit, I'm sure you'll do fine. <br>  When I do a home visit, the main things I look for are fenced yard, appropriate place for the dog to sleep and be kept while the owners are gone, and make sure there's nothing dangerous. The main things you can do are:<br>  - make sure the yard fenced and is the fence in good condition<br>  - hazards in the yard could include old, rusty cars, poisonous plants, insectidice or weed killer that isn't properly contained, etc. Make sure you have none of that<br>  - I doubt they will inspect your garage, unless it's accessible to the dog. If your dog could get in the garage, just put anything up that could harm the dog, chemicals, tools, weed killer, etc. <br>  - You can earn double points by having a bed all set up for the dog. <br>  - Just clean up the house enough that it's pretty well 'dog proofed' and you should do fine.
kvHqnR5Haa	I feel the exact opposite.  I have three nephews and two nieces and the boys are absolute terrors when it comes to the dogs (we have five small dogs between my sister, mom, and me).  They chase them and corner them and jab at them.  They are not allowed to be alone with them out of fear of the boys hurting them.  The girls, on the other hand, are so gentle and caring with them!  They play gently and cuddle with them.  The dogs ADORE the girls and hide from the boys.  So I guess it just depends on the personality of the kids and the dogs.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I agree with some of the points of the answers above - especially about the way the kids are raised and whether they are taught to respect the animals.  Of the three boys listed above, the youngest one (two years old) is the best with the dogs because he was taught to be nice to them - he can be rough but usually not on purpose.  The oldest one (seven) is the worst and i don't let him go near my puppy - his mom, my sister, thinks it is cute and that it is just a boy being a boy.  The middle one (four) is a bit better but not much - he is the little brother of the two girls so he was taught the same as them but he is still a terror around them.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	dogs mostly take there cue from there owners, if you tense up because you see a little girl coming at you squealing theres the cue to your dog to get on the defense. my 2 year old daughter was taught by myself and husband to always ask to pet someones dog. maybe the children you are running into have not had animals in there lives we have 6 dogs and believe me my daughter was taught to respect them. if you have a girl its your job as parent and dog owner to teach them to respect each other.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	i like girl dogs as they are more gentle especially with children|`|xLPB0Z2maa	I am 11 year old girl and my dogs ( boys Murphy and Toby) adore me and the high pitched nis of me. Toby, my Golden re. never leaves me alone. Boys tend to like tackl the dogs sometimes. My old dog Buddy perfered grown men, he would hump my daddys leg :)|`|AHF0DR9baa	The only distinction, for me, is not between the sex of the child but (a) how well mannered it is and (b) whether they're familiar with animals!<br>  A child that has never come across a pet won't know about the boundaries that a child who has a pet in the home will. <br>  Funny enough, I have most often experienced the opposite of what you've observed - which I suppose just shows that it depends totally on the children involved!<br>  Needless to say, it also makes a lot of difference what age the child is, because you can tell them pretty young but they only understand at a certain age!<br>  In my experience, there is also a difference between the sex of the dog and how they react to humans of each gender: our male dogs were pretty friendly with us girls and cool with the boys, and vice versa.<br>  Don't worry that your dogs won't like any kids you have - you're sure to raise them to respect the dogs and behave appropriately so I'm sure you won't have a problem.|`|KxjUim7yaa	If both are fixed, the males or females are much alike(dogs) They are much calmer dogs.You are right about little girls wanting to have more hands on and being more high pitched than a little boy. Little boys can play ruff to though if knows the dog well. Some dogs adapt well to kids added to the family. Some dogs are jealous. The calmer the dog the better the chance of acceptance, but children under 6 should not be with the dogs unsupervised.|`|Da2wsh7saa	It really depends on the child and not the sex of the child. If the child was to taught to behave around animals and treat them with respect, then obviously the child and the dog will get along just fine. You have to kind of know which one of your friends has children who behave. Let the ones who do play with the dogs. Keep a close eye on the kids who act up and scream. If you raise your child the right way then you won't have a problem:)|`|GrYhFNMdaa	I think children treat animals how there parents let them. If its a boy or girl it doesn't matter. If you raise a child to be gentle and calm then they will be. I think if an animal has a bad experience with one gender then yes they can be a bit more sensitive towards them but they also know the ones they can trust. If you have a girl, just teach her how to be kind and gentle and she will be. A girl is not born that way. Just show her as she grows up :) my mom showed me and i was always kind and never smothered them lol|`|hoDvh61waa	You are like the "pack leader" to your dogs. if you are calm and what not around children the dogs will see that you are calm and follow in your lead. also, before a little kid comes to pet the dog just ask them to be calm or whatever. If you tell them you don't want them to scare the dog they'll probably listen. if you have a baby girl i'm sure the dogs will love her because they see the way you love her, and she'll be used to them so she wouldn't squeal when she sees them. it also depends on the dog and the child. my dog LOVES little kids, but if a little kid is afraid of her she can tell and backs off.
hoDvh61waa	you could sign up a dog for doggy day care. At a good place the dogs are watched over and well taken care of and they can play and make new friends. also, if you're moving out of state and have to fly, it might be a good idea NOT to bring the dog on the plane, especially because many dogs are afraid of loud noises. They have services where someone will drive your dog to wherever you are going...and it's a good idea as long as you're not going very far away.|`|AA10229248	Check the meetup website for groups in your area:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.meetup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetup.com</a><br>  <br>  Most areas have a dog walkers group, some even have breed specific meet ups.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	try finding out if there are Agility classes where you are moving to|`|njAD3U5Aaa	Trying searching local listings for doggie friendly activities.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	While your cichlids seem peaceful with each other, there's a risk they'd still nip at the elephant nose.    The Elephant Nose originates from a similar environment to the BGK so would not appreciate the more alkaline environment of the african rift lake cichlids.    They do best with larger peaceful south american fish - but no fish related to it - and acidic darker planted water conditions.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Yes, I think it is safe to say that aggression by the cichlids against the elephant noses would be a big problem in this arrangement. Elephant noses are very sensitive and shy, and they won't do well at all with fish that harass them. They also generate weak electric fields that might irritate the cichlids.    I don't know what a "BGK" is, so I can't comment on your other tank.    ... Is BGK "black ghost knifefish"? In that case, it might work if the knifefish and elephant nose are about the same size and the tank is large enough to give both of them lots of hiding places (such as large rock caves and legths of pipe). If the elephant nose is much smaller than the Black Ghost, though, the Black Ghost will eat the elephant nose.|`|AA12310378	They are not compatible with rift lake cichlids.     They actually need similar conditions to the BGK so if you want one you need another tank.|`|AraBfesHaa	First, before you worry about them getting along, you have to make sure  the tank requirements are the same, such as water hard/softness, ph, temperature etc  Bottlenoses are very shy fish and hide alot, grow to 13" and need a minimum tank length of around 40".  They require lots of plants, subdued lighting, soft substrate,   They're nocturnal so need to be fed at night and are extremely sensitive to water quality.  If you can supply all that, then next is what else can it be put with.  If  you put it with aggressive cichlids, they probably won't be able to compete for food, but the WEST African cichlid would be o.k.
Eyawiwc5aa	Good possibility that your iguana is too cold ... if the house temp is 68 then the igs temps are most likely too low w/ just a heat lamp.  If you bought your ig from a pet store I would highly recommend seeing a herp/reptile vet to have a check up, many pet store igs can be sick when purchased.    Basic care for iguanas:  Young iguana (8-10 months of age) should not live in anything smaller the a 55 gallon tank. Smaller the tank you can not process the correct temps threw out. Enclosure needs to be at least 1.5-2 times it's total length ... an adult you will need a space of 6-7ft tall x 8-10ft long x 4ft wide.  Temps:  never let drop below 70F ...  basking 92-96F if temp is too low digestion is slowed too high food digests too fast and nutrition is lost  medium/middle (overall) 88-92F  cool 75-84F  at night 73-84F ... having a temp gun works the best to know what your igs body temp truly is.  *** NO HEAT ROCKS PLEASE ... they can cause major burns on the under belly ... igs dont feel heat from below so they will sit there not knowing they are burning themselves ***  - Depending on enclosure size, depends on wattage, but for basking light (along w/ UVB tube) you can use a house bulb for heat during the day, you don't have to use one of those costly basking bulbs you buy at the store (night if your house gets below 70 a CHE should be used - produces heat no light)  - Stick on glass thermometers do not work, they can read incorrect, get a good thermometer w/ a probe at the end, and place where your iguana is basking under and at his/her level, you will get more of a correct temp reading  Humidity:  Iguanas are tropical and do need humidity. Spraying/Misting a few times a day will help some, silk fake leaves (bigger then your igs head) will help hold some humidity, having a humidifier or vaporizer next to the tank will help (figure out a way to pipe inside would be better but think child proof also), daily baths will help and learn to go potty in the tub less mess in tank.  UVB: (12 hrs on during day - 12 hrs off during night no light)  US: ReptiSun 10.0 distance 8-10 inches from your igs body  Repti Glo 8.0 distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  ReptiSun 5.0 distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  UK: Arkadia distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  - You will need to adjust the distance as your ig grows  - Using a shop light from a home improvement store works the best, get one that has 2 tube plugs and using 2 UVB tubes  - The UVB listed are in tube form, using the 36-48inch tubes are the best more length for your ig  - Surface under the UVB tube lights need to be a flat surface if at an angle your igs body will not get the proper UVB threw out. You also need to change the UVB tubes listed above every 6months  - There are UVB's out there on the market now that can cause eye damange to your ig (do not use the compact or the coil type - see the uvguide.co.uk for further information)  - W/out UVB your ig may end up w/ MBD (Metabolic Bone Disease)  - UVB information that you may find interesting:  http://www.uvguide.co.uk  Floor covering:  BAD floor covering: bark, dirt, moss, sand, pellets are all bad ... at some point your iguana will try and lick swallow and then possibly cause blockage which will then need to be surgically removed or possibly death ... SAFE floor covering: newspaper (unprinted), paper towels, towels, vinyl flooring, indoor/outdoor carpeting - if you have any lose fibers from the carpeting or the towels please remove and replace - unprinted newspaper if you possibly can use is safer just in case your ig likes to try and eat the newspaper some ink may contain soy  Food:  Daily food should have 5-7 good staple greens (2-3 cups a day if not more younger igs may eat less then 1/4 cup) ... collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens (if you can find), endive, radicchio, arugula, mache (if you can find), watercress ... some greens to give occasionally kale, bok choy, escarole ... adding basil for young igs sometimes helps them eat ... romaine is mostly water no nutrience, you can add small amount and occasionally in w/ the good staple greens (collard, mustard, etc) but do not make romaine just your iguanas choice of greens (or any other type of lettuce most of us humans eat) ... some things to add (small amounts) snap peas, bell peppers (every now and then), parsnip, sweet potato/yam, acorn squash, butternut squash, buttercup squash ... fruits should only be given every now and then once or twice a week type of thing fruits are like junk food to iguanas ... some fruits to try papay, kiwi, mango, raspberries, strawberries, grapes, honeydew (great water source), canalope (great water source), 12 grain wheat bread ... if anything has seeds make sure you remove seed before you give it to your iguana anything w/ small seeds like strawberries wait like 3 days before giving anymore ... watermelon (seedless) can be frozen and then shaved onto your iguanas food helps w/ hydration everyday ... there are some foods that aren't good for your iguana: spinach has oxalate acids bind to the calcium, so even though spinach is high in calcium, almost none is actually available for the iguana to use, also the oxalate acids can form oxalate crystals which can and do build up in the kidneys causing kidney damage/failure ... some ig owners do give there ig spinach but in very small amounts and only once a month ... corn igs can not digest ... carrots can block calcium absorption ... bananas are low in calcium best to give another type of fruit ... apples too much acid - appetite suppressant ... rhubarb is poisonous ... food should be cut/chopped/diced no bigger then the iguanas head, if they are small having a chopper chop them up, or slice them into very small pieces ... spray/mist food to help w/ wat|`|MX9M36B4aa	You should also have a UVB bulb on her as well.This is what provides the d3 that they need to digest their food.You should also be giving her the iguana daily vitaminss every time you feed her too.I would recommend getting her to a vet.Good luck with this honey:)|`|WvejdIrJaa	Does she have a vitamine d3 lamp as well?Is the temperature over 80 degrees?Does she have humidity over 60%?Did you do any research before buying your poor iguana?

3sB49YNnaa	OK, you have to make a choice.  If you want to show him, you cannot neuter him.  I don't know that I buy all the talk that neutering prolongs the life of rabbits.  Right now, our old Himalayan buck is nine and going strong and he is not at all unusual.<br>  <br>  Shows are a lot of fun.  Lionheads are a brand new breed which is becoming very popular.  They do not yet have status as a standardized breed but rather they have a working standard which is the first step in formal recognition.  That means that they can be shown at official ARBA shows and you often see quite a few.

They're the best places to show<br>  4. If you get or make a nice hutch. Look them up on google. there should also be a penned space, and it has to be enclosed on top and all around.

Just going on adverts I've seen on birdtrader, those may not be averages. Please make sure you do plenty of research and dont just go on your friends advice, these are highly complicated creatures to keep, and a suitable outdoor enclosure will probably cost around 1000 (maybe a little more or less, I'm not sure on the size and bar thickness recommendation for these birds).

The heater will be on less if you insulate the back and any non viewed sides of the tank with polystyrene and you can put a blanket or duvet over the whiole tank overnight.  Lighting is the biggest expense and if the tank isn't planted the fish will be ok with room lighting. Just put the lights on to see the fish for a few hours a day.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	This is really honky tonky, but, you can boil a rock or 2 and put them into the tank, they will keep the tank heated for over 3-4 days and then you just have to do it again.  Really a heater doesn't require so much money.  You don't need lighting 24/7 but fish do just fine with any old desk lamp unless you have plants, if you have plants, proper fish tank lights are required.  you can also keep your tank near a window, not under direct sunlight otherwise you will get an algae breakout.  Good luck!!|`|6KsGSDh5aa	Do not boil rocks.  They can explode and cause you serious injury as well as having hot rocks added to cooler water.......such as your fish tank......may also explode breaking your tank!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Heaters and filters don't really add that much to your electric bill but the lights do.  My electric bill really shot up when I started adding plant lights.    You have to have heat and you have to have good filtration or their is no point in having fish at all but the plants you can live without if need be.

tY14vbrKaa	Daily exercise, walk and play before you leave the house.  Crate train.  A confined pet will not "mess" all over your home while you're away.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	when you leave him leave a radio on for him it may help if he hears a voice as it will make him think he is not alone|`|ZSXstSXBaa	Ignore him when you get home. Don't show him ANY attention (talking, petting, anything) until he is fully calm. <br>  You can also find more info at <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/separationanxiety.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/separationan...</a><br>  that site helped me a little with my 64lb. pit bull! (Imagine 64lbs of muscle coming and jumping on you at full sprint!!!) I think the thing that helped the most is that we completely ignored her when we came home. Don't make a big deal of seeing your baby again and she won't. Also, is he being taken out enough so he doesn't have the opportunity to poop or pee inside. If you know you're going to be gone for long and don't want to kennel him, I'd invest in puppy pads, diapers, or something like that. (You can find REALLY cute washable diapers online and they're only like $10-$20!)|`|qvPe0GPJaa	Read up on crate training although if you have other dogs it might not be the answer. It is good for bedtime though.You have to ignore him when you get in, not easy but it's the first step. when he is finally calm then you can speak to him. There are some very good books available on this subject also allexperts.com have some excellent experts. This is a speration anxiety, you are right but you need to get in control of it before it gets worse, and it will ! Put him in a different room from you when you are in the house for short periods, it'll be noisy for a while but it is another step that helps. Good luck, been there, experienced it.|`|xbnFcN16aa	I read the dog whisperer book and she recommended re-inforcing the leader of the pack issue.  When u come into your house u need to blank the dog for 5 minutes then call the dog to you.  Other steps include feeding, let the dog see you pretend to eat 1st then offer what is left to the dog.  It's all about being the leader.
97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Basic Info:    To begin i would like you to know just a beginner it's not a good idea to mix peaceful fish with aggressive fish, as you already started noticing your fish passing away and damaged. It's ok we all make mistakes when we start something new, so don't let that disappoint you at all just learn from your mistakes. Bettas are normally supposed to be kept alone or with fish that can defend itself since betta can become very territorial and plus they have there own special food that they should only eat but most people disregard that and then wonder why there fish died so soon. The gourami is it in that tank but keep an eye on him because they can be somewhat territorial but not as aggressive as the betta. I can bet you that the gourami is the one who nipped on the betta's fin probably during a fight when you were not around, i know so because i have several aquariums and know the characteristics of those fish. Also make sure you change 25% of there water weekly to keep them healthy and it also helps reduce stress. But i strongly recommend you to get the betta out of that tank and put him elsewhere by himself.    Feeding:    I don't know where others got there information from but let me tell you that freshwater fish should NOT be fed only once because there stomachs works like machines and digests the food very fast. I would recommend you to feed them three time meaning morning afternoon and at night 10 minutes before you turn off the lights. Saying that doesn't mean feed them large amounts three times a day, you should feed them the amount they can eat in 1 minutes, i would suggest you time it the first time and then you will know the right amount. On weekend you can feed them twice instead of three times, that way they stay healthy. Lack of food is also one reason why some fish attack others. Hunger makes them more aggressive towards other fish. I would also suggest that you get them a treat such as dried bloodworms which are sold in fish stores in a container. It makes them happy and makes them feel more natural and helps keep there color and health. Feed treat once a week (weekend in the place of there regular food). Well thats all you need to know, now its up to you to listen to my advice or to listen to others. I wish you and your fish the best enjoy them and always remember to learn from mistakes because thats the only way to getting close to perfect.    Additional:    Bettas are naturally aggressive fish all there life it's not like they just become aggressive all of the sudden; it's just how they are.  I also know that you might not always see anything happening in your tank while you are around because most fish do notice human presence and usually do not do anything to each other but rather waits for food or attention but once you leave or go to sleep, thats where the action takes place and you will just notice damaged or dead fish.  Some petstore will sell anything to get money because that's what they truly care for, and don't care wheter your fish are compatible or not so be careful next time you fish shop.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	twice is good enough and get the betta out of the tank and it maybe the gourami nipping|`|CPxmHjx4aa	feed once a day...overfeeding causes problems with the fish and causes water problems (acid, bacteria from uneaten food)..  i only feed mine one time a day and have had success for years|`|MJW7Etk3aa	feed them once a day thats what i do and there all healthy|`|dD08pRIwaa	Probably not. The betta will fight (possibly to the death) with all those fish and it's most likely what killed your guppies. A betta will attack anything with fins long enough.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	omg i have all those fish in my tank :) yey some one that is like me but do you have at least a 180liter tank coz if not your dwarf gourami will go rusty and black thts why my gourami is called rusty but when we moved to a new tank he has his colour back xx but any way i only feed myne once a day but feed them quite well dont over feed them, do not listen to the packet x|`|AraBfesHaa	It doesn't really hurt as long as you don't overfeed them.  I used to feed my mollies 3x a day (breakfast lunch and dinner doncha know).  Did that for a couple of years with no problems.  They're big pigs anyway.  After the first couple of years I don't know, I got tired or it got monotonous or something so now I feed them 2x a day, but it wasn't because it was causing them any problems at all.  If they get hungry, they'll just kill the weakest fish in the tank and eat it till it's gone (and they act like they're always hungry, as I'm sure you've found out by now)|`|kgHBKcbAaa	I had a fish and i use to feed it a lot and it died so i recomend not to feed it a lot maybe once in the morning and once in the night but not that much|`|LgYRrucuaa	Feeding 3 times a day is not a good idea, looks like you got the wrong mix of fish, doesn't matter whether they are hungry or not, some breeds should not be together in the same tank.|`|8CereM2vaa	mollies are very aggressive.|`|N8lnHXunaa	Once a day is enough.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	no offense but, why would you put any of those fish with a betta? i'm sure the guppies didn't die due to the bubbler, i can almost be sure the guppies died because the betta tore them to bits and pieces.|`|xvQHCNwmaa	those fish are not snipping at eachother because they are hungry...thats aggression. a Betta with all those other fish?!?! You do know those are solitair fish right?  Feeding 3 times a day can be fine as long as you remove any uneaten food within 2 minutes of putting it in.  *note* Torn fins is a sign of a unhealthy fish. Fish that are being attacked all the time are stessed out...and that leads to disease  You need to remove the Betta and put him in his own seperate tank or get a divider for him to seperate the other fish.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	This is the reason betta's should be housed alone.  This is one of the few fish that don't even get along with their own species and will only tolerate a female long enough to breed.    With any fish, if it fits in their mouth, it's a snack.  Doesn't mean your betta is more aggressive.  He thinks the guppies are food.    I suspect the mollies are working on that betta's tail.  They are aggressive and don't want to be with him.
awUzUxo5aa	Gerbils,<br>  <br>  Their funny, but on the downside they don't live long.....|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Don't listen to all the people saying "Don't get a sugar glider cause they stink!"<br>  <br>  Those people obviously didn't keep theirs clean and they don't know what they are talking about. They are adorable and they can be trained to go places with you! You can have a lot of fun with them, And feeding them isn't really a hassle either because they eat most of the food you do. Sugar glider would be a good pet to go for if you have the time to spend on them.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	NOT sugar gliders or most things people have suggested, sugar gliders are smelly and noisy...plus very high maintenance and expensive, and the cage will be too big to escape notice!<br>  <br>  I would go for a chinchilla, they dont really smell and are active and playful, but they do require a big cage and you will need to watch them when they come out to play because they are terrors for carpet chewing. Gerbils or hamsters are another good choice. You could consider a lizard but they will eat crickets which are noisy and smelly, plus although some become very tame you cant really play with them.|`|tT256JQRaa	no snakes right.. but what about lizards?<br>  they come in all sorts or sizes, shapes and colours for you to pick from, are really clean and make nesxt to no noise (only making noise when you scare them etc)<br>  any reptile really is pretty clean and silent :)<br>  <br>  as rodents and rabbits make noise, mess, and smell<br>  <br>  giant land snails are also pretty cool, hissing cockroaches, and hermit crabs... but because of the humidity and vegetation issues, these guys could smell a tad.<br>  <br>  anything in a tank would be easier than anything in a cage - landlord comes in and you just throw a cover over the tank and pretend its a table without any fear of anything chewing the cover! genius! haha<br>  <br>  a leopard gecko would be great if its your first lizard - small (about 8 inches long), likes to be handled and can be kept in a pretty small space.<br>  heres a care sheet :)<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsaspets/p/leopardgecko.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsas...</a><br>  <br>  bearded dragons are bigger, about 2ft, but you might want to look into them anyways.<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsaspets/a/beardeddragons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsas...</a><br>  <br>  blue tongue skink? about 2ft also<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsaspets/a/bluetongues.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/lizardsas...</a><br>  <br>  or a smaller berber skink (about 14 inches)<br>  <a href="http://www.the-lizard-lounge.com/content/species/berber-skink.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-lizard-lounge.com/content...</a>|`|j7HeuFeVaa	guinea pig?? they would probably smell abit much.<br>  What about a baby mouse? I think they would be okay<br>  Or even a turtle, you can take them out to play with.<br>  Hope you find the right pet :)|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	A lizard sounds like the perfect pet for you. They don't smell, obviously pretty quiet, and not really high maintenance. I find them very intresting, and you can also add more to your collection without much more effort. There are tons of different types of lizards, too.<br>  But if lizards don't sound that exciting, maybe hermit crabs? They do smell a bit, but if you keep their cage/tank fairly clean, they won't be that bad. They can be noisy if whatever you put in the tank is hard, like rocks or shells, but if you use sand, you'll hardly ever hear them. All you have to do is put a little food in the tank (seriously, just a little. they barely eat at all.) and keep their sponge watered.<br>  Turtles smell really bad, but if you're willing to sacrifice that much, they're otherwise pretty easy. Put 'em in a tank with some water, drop a little food in everyday, and that's pretty much it. Keep their tank clean, though. Plus their fun to play with.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|7ZjloThDaa	A lizard is something you can take out of the cage they would not leave a lot of "evidence". Rats also make great pets, they are very social (mine will sit on my shoulder) and as long as you clean the cage they are not smelly (you can even train them to do tricks).|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	Guinea pig for sure. They are a great pet. You can pet them and let them out of the cage. They dont really smell too bad just go buy bedding that is odor eliminator. The best part is they eat fruits and veggies along with some dry food and grasses they sell at petstores. If you decide to get one just be sure to do some research on them because some food and kill them and you want to be sure on what foods they are.|`|yzoTvZxNaa	I think that you should get a small rodent like a hamster maybe a sugar glider but maybe you shouldn't get a Sugar glider because they jump around a lot so here is a list of pets that could be a good idea to have in a flat :)<br>  1. A hamster<br>  2. A chinchilla<br>  3. A ferret or a gerbil <br>  x hope I helped x<br>     x Good luck pet hunting x|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Maybe a Gecko they are cute and quiet. I almost got one at the pet store he was staring out of the aquarium and looked so friendly. But I have never owned one. Make sure you look up all care and needs what ever you choose. Good Luck|`|OwjgwJQEaa	Anyone you can find - there all the same.|`|6W2imvnaaa	Under your circumstances I would recommend either a ferret or a chinchilla.|`|b5QWb0Fgaa	a bunny theye are real cute can be litter box trained and even walk them on a leash and when its time for the landlord to come just put it in a cage|`|OrvTG44laa	If you have the time, a ferret.  They are very good pets for apartments.  They only weigh about two pounds and don't make much noise.  They are very sociable and enjoy being with humans.  Just a note, ferrets aren't like hamsters or gerbils.  They are more like dogs.  They don't even live in the wild anymore.  They have been completely domesticated with humans.  <br>  They can be put in a cage, but need to come out everyday for four hours minimum.  Getting two is better, because they can play with each other and have a playmate when you can't be there.  Two ferrets are actually less work.  <br>  Weekly cage cleaning will keep their smell down.  Keep bathing to a maximum of two times per year.  Too much bathing makes them smell bad.  <br>  These animals are fun, but require weekly ear cleaning, nail trimming and teeth cleaning.  They also have to be brushed once a week.  Thier cage must be cleaned once a week, but these animals can be trained to use a litter box, so their cage won't be too hard to clean.  They need shots though.  Three canine distemper shots and a yearly rabies vaccination.<br>  The ferret is a lot of work.  Definitely not for someone who wants a low maintenance pet.  If you can do the work, it will be very rewarding and you will be very happy with your pet.|`|lUwuVgiWaa	Mice (2 or 3 females, they are social) or a Hamster (just one if it's a syrian) might be good for you. <br>  <br>  Mice and Hamsters don't squeak hardly ever, the most noise they make is the sound of their wheel as they run in it. And if you clean the cage/tank every 2 weeks then you wont even notice the smell.<br>  <br>  Plus they are easy to keep and can be quite playful and friendly if you take the time to work with them. And you can get the exercise balls so they can run around at your place.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3hwUClG4aa	Your options are pretty limited really, because most animals have some sort of smell to them, so thats a difficult one. Probably a hamster, cos they sleep most of the time but can also be played with, plus if you keep the cage well cleaned out all the time, the smell will be limited|`|AA11658729	Hello<br>  i think you should get a rabbit <br>  <br>  the only bad things about them are that if they get scared they will thump and you do have too change them a bit because the do poo and the do spray and i you have a girl they can be aggressive but you can  house train them.<br>  i once looked after a rabbit for a friend and the day i had to give him back i got my own.<br>  over all they are cute ,loving, friendly animal and do not forget that they are cheep too.<br>  that is my opinion and if it does not help you then i am sorry|`|KOtMicRKaa	i would go with a lizard to like a gecko or something most are friendly and they dont usually make noises so i think that would be the best|`|s2PcI5D0aa	I think Gerbils are really cute and they are smart!!!

After the babies are born make sure there are no loud noises, and do not put your hand in the cage. If you do the mom will be angered to eat her babies. do not stress the mom either. after 4-6 weeks you can take the baby hamsters out and you must seperate all of them in different  cages or they will fight and one  will die.

LVPYnB6gaa	we got our cat a tall baby door and put it in the hall way before the door so we can open it safely without him running out. this i believe is the best idea also lots of toys and small mice. cats go crazy for lasers (the red light) point it on the floor and even the laziest of cats will be entertained. my husband and i each put one on our key chain and pointed it away from the door while we were leaving the get distracted from you leaving and chase the light. this gives you just enough time to get out the door.|`|o0I5YXMNaa	That's really hard.  We have trained our house cat to use a harness and lead.|`|3GHXk05saa	It takes time but you can get her to be near the door but not sneak out, it just takes training. You have to tell her no, move her back a bit and you may have to go out sideways for a while. It worked for our cat. Now she backs away when told to and just sits there. If we have a lot of activity or will have the door open for a long time, such as hauling lots of groceries in, we lock her in a bedroom to keep her safe.<br>  You can take her out, but do it on a leash. Get a harness (not just a collar) and a long leash. Then she can go out as long as she's tethered and monitored so she doesn't get hung up. That's one reason you want a harness, so she won't hang herself. But, you still have to keep an eye on her.<br>  It takes time to get them used to it. Mine hated it for a while but she learned that's the only way she gets to go out so she accepts it now. She loves going out and will come running when she hears the harness jingle. The neighbors think it's hysterical, but she really enjoys it and doesn't even try to get out without it any more. <br>  She may not want to go out to mate, but they still love the grass and to be a little tiger now and then.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	I can't help you with the meowing, but you need to make the door area unfriendly to her.  A squirt gun, or even a jar with coins in it that you rattle often discourages an approach to the door.<br>  <br>  Does she have a safe and secure place to hide from the 'reign of terror' from your two year old?  And if that place has a window to look out of, that should help a lot.<br>  <br>  Your moving also probably has played a role.  Many times, cats don't like change.  But that should fade.|`|esyzk97Laa	Keep her confined where there are no outside doors for a few weeks...Give her small treats and some toys to keep her busy...|`|efaa37a6bc4099dfbc7b2158a2ec4965aa	Lola,<br>  Since your cat is declawed, it is imperative that she doesn't get out.  Without her claws, she has no way to defend herself.  But, if she is bound and determined to get out, you may want to put her in a halter and let her go out on your lap so she can identify her suroundings should she escape, she'll be better able to find her way home.  She may be lonely for a friend, have you considered another cat?|`|KvUJZa1Paa	When my cat wants out which is rare, we are usually out there .

0m6BgESXaa	Fish oil can help, as well as a raw egg or two in the food.  Make sure that if you're feeding kibble, you're feeding a no soy no wheat no corn brand.<br>  <br>  Dandruff is usually in relation to dry skin, however, a dog can also produce more of it (and shed more) when they are stressed.<br>  <br>  A good bath once a month or every other month in a quality oatmeal shampoo with a good cream conditioner can also help.|`|YFTZM86maa	You can add vegetable oil to his food.  call and ask a vet for how much, I'm sure someone will just tell you over the phone.  I know for a mid sized dog I had, it was 1/4 cup on her dry food a day.|`|abMqdpHyaa	I found that fish oil is really good for my own dogs skin.

Most breeds are actually allergic to corn and it manifests itself in their skin and coat. A healthy dog on the inside is a healthy dog on the outside. Good skin = less dander and this is accomplished with bathing and good food.|`|ZSXstSXBaa	Changing the dog food would help like miss v said. I used to use Purina dog chow but found out that some dogs can be allergic to the corn meal. (Also, just a side note you shouldn't feed an animal anything with corn gluten meal because it is an insecticide and is illegal in some foreign countries because it's poisonous.)Some signs are if your dog rubs his face along the ground and whines, sneezes a lot, or paws at its nose. My dogs and I like chicken soup for the dog lovers soul. It's a higher quality dog food but a little cheaper than brands like innova and canidae. Their coats are a lot shinier and softer. Also, my vet told me to use baby shampoo or puppy shampoo because it's not as harsh on your dogs skin.|`|1C9wyrvxaa	Dandruff is usually caused by dry skin. A couple of things could be causing the problem.<br>  <br>  Bathing a dog with harsh soaps or bathing them too often will dry out their skin. <br>  <br>  Allerigies can also cause skin issues. I cannot feed my pug anything with grains in it, or her skin gets really itchy and dry. The dog food that I feed her is fish and potatoe.. not grains at all and it has worked wonders.|`|C13Y5s90aa	Baby oil works too
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Sounds like you've got the "piggie slave" routine down well! LOL<br>  <br>  A higher nutrient variety of veggies would serve your piggies well. Instead of parsley twice a day, cut it down to once, and add a dark green leafy veggie like Romaine lettuce, curly red or green lettuces, or bell pepper (any colour). These contain more nutrients than the melon & cucumber. Parsley is also high in calcium so you don't want it to be an every day staple.<br>  <br>  If you live in an area where spring is arriving, fresh grass and dandelions (the whole thing--leaves, stem, & flower--not roots) is a terrific addition to the diet. Just make sure its clean. :)|`|hQ6ZqHjzaa	I would give them a little more variety, try alternating veg every few days.<br>  <br>  Parsley contains a lot of calcium, which can lead to bladder stones so I would instead feed them parsely 2-3 times a weeks instead of everyday. Also, cucumber and melon don't have very many nutrients in them, and are composed of mostly water. I think your piggies are lacking vitamin c in their diet and maybe you shoudl add some veg high in vitmai c such as romaine lettuce.<br>  <br>  The site below has a list of piggie safe fruit and veg, so maybe make their diet a little more interesting and varied. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theguineapigforum.co.uk/showthread.php?t=42" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguineapigforum.co.uk/showt...</a>|`|nPdKJyK4aa	It sounds like you are taking pretty good care of your piggies. I would agree on the fruit and you should be giving them less than a ping pong ball sized per day. I would like you to join out guinea pig forum!

You might want to reduce the number of times a week you feed the melon and replace it with something less sugary|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I wouldnt feed them too much tomato, it can be toxic to a lot of animals. Also, in practise it is better to rotate the fruits and veggies so they get different nutrients in their diet....and they can have a good handful a day. As long as you avoid citrus fruits, onions and iceberg lettuce, you can feed most veggies. For example:<br>  <br>  Monday: romaine or rocket lettuce, small piece of apple, carrot<br>  tuesday: celery, lollo rosso, small piece of pear, broccoli<br>  wednesday: spinach, cucumber, courgette<br>  <br>  Just vary what you give them. Also, 75% of your piggies diet should be hay, high quality and non dusty, which should always be available to them. I know people who feed hardly any pellets with lots of hay and veggies, its much healthier for the teeth and body

lTeXIjpOaa	shavings would be somewhat green, as they are biodegradable, not the bags they come in though, you could find a way to recycle/reuse them; trees are a renewable resource, but using straw for a little while you will get used to it, it is cheaper than shavings; baling straw uses a huge amount of gasoline, produces emissions, first you have to plant the wheat, harvest the wheat, then bale the straw that is left over|`|8cikAYp3aa	Green..  green would be  rubber stall mats.  yes, they  are made from petroleum products,  but they last nearly forever and are recyclable.

They break down over a few years and form a good compost, as long as they are handled properly. In some ways, they're even better than straw for compost purposes, as the composted product is less likely to contain seeds that would then sprout in the garden. As far as shavings production, they're generally produced from the 'waste' left over after milling and contribute to using the whole tree.<br>  <br>  Its important to make sure they haven't been treated with anything at the farm (they aren't normally treated for or with anything at the sawmill) if you're composting them as those chemicals won't interfere with the composting process but could be harmful if vegetables or potatoes are grown in the composted material.|`|XX03Sd0faa	We use Auboise.

LxUX3TdLaa	Make sure you wash your hands really good beforehand so they don't smell food and decide that you smell tasty enough to eat ;)<br>  <br>  I would stick my hand in the cage and see what they do, let them come up to you and smell you - then start to pet them - JUST PET FOR NOW. <br>  <br>  Do that like every hour for a day! Then you should get like a small roller ball for it to get inside of and then pet it while it's inside the ball. <br>  <br>  Put your hand next to the opening of the ball so the gerbil can decide if it wants to venture out onto your hand or if it wants to stay inside the ball! This is a great bonding experience - once you do that quite a few times then go back to sticking your hand in the cage and laying your hand out so that they can decide to get on your hand if they want to.<br>  <br>  Never force your hand in their faces lol you will more than likely get bit. <br>  <br>  Good luck and remember to wash those hands!!
AA11896276	You have to have a rooster  to fertilize her eggs for her to want to "sit". It is still a bit too early for the urge to sit just yet. Too cold still for the chicks  to live. Natures clock in the hen will tell her when it is  time to "sit". <br>    When she is ready she will lay several eggs over a period  of a week or so, this is a clutch  of eggs. Usually 7 to 15 eggs. When she is through laying  she will sit on the eggs for almost  for a month (usually 21 to 28 days) and the eggs will hatch. There may be a few that won't hatch  but that is normal. But for chicks  you have to have a rooster.<br>  If  there is no rooster  the hen will continue  to lay eggs  but will not try to sit  on a clutch  and hatch them.<br>  <br>  Edit : Sorry I didn't read the other post. Since you have a rooster  just wait. She will get around to sitting when nature tells her to.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Often, chickens won't.  I don't know the reason for this, but my family keeps hens, and only occasionally will one go "broody" and actually nest on the eggs.  The rest of the time they lay them and go back to wandering around.  Whether there is a rooster around to fertilise the eggs doesn't seem to affect whether they do this or not.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	Well do you even have a boy chicken that she can make fertile eggs with.

Does that help?|`|wZzul8cZaa	Sorry for your loss.It will take awhile and you will found yourself crying for no reason but it will get easier.You can take your cat to the vet to get cremated and have it on the mantle or bury it in the garden near a rose bush or any plant or flowers as a memorial.That way you have a place to remember your cat.I have my dog on the mantle and my 16 year old cat that died recently is under my Red rose bush where he loved to sleep.|`|PnZlFQeOaa	If your cat dies at home the best thing to do is to take it to either the local shelter or a vet.

Where I live I am fortunate to have a pet cemetery and crematorium near me so our shelter and vets will charge less.

550KYFj5aa	My first answer would be YES! Do not buy a horse sight-unseen.<br>  That said I just did. Though I have had  many years experience with horses, I did a lot of research, in addition to speaking with the owner I spoke directly with the horse's breeder, trainer, vet, farrier and dentist. I researched the sire, I saw numerous videos which the owner took specifically for me demonstrating the horses response to my different requests and after all of this I had an independent vet complete a full health check. The purchase price was significantly more than $600 but still in a range that would allow me to on-sell the horse for a profit if I decided I didn't like it.<br>  The horse is everything that my research told me it would be and it has been a success. <br>  That said I wouldn't recommend that anyone do this unless you know exactly what you are doing and at the end of the day you are prepared to acknowledge that it is VERY RISKY buying a horse without seeing it, particularly if you have no experience!<br>  In your instance I would suggest that you don't buy a horse without seeing it unless you can. <br>  And the others are right, horses that are that cheap are often untrained, injured, have vices that required experience to deal with or something other wrong with it that would make it completely unsuitable for an inexperienced person.<br>  If you want a first horse try looking at an aged horse as they are often set in their ways and what you see when you first meet it is what it will be like and ALWAYS get an independent VET health check!<br>  cheers and goodluck.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	NEVER buy a horse without riding a horse at LEAST twice and always have a vet check the horse. It may look healhy to you, but you should have a vet check it if you are going to consider buying it, because there may be something wrong with it that you can't tell right away.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I wouldnt buy a horse over the internet its very dangerous you could end up with anything. Go and see the horse and try it out, ask the owner to verify in writing that it has no vices, health problems etc so you have a comeback if it turns out to be ill. and ALWAYS pay for a full vetting for your horse, it is a false economy to skip vetting, you could end up with a $400 a month health problem.|`|5I01tsgYaa	Horses going for that cheap generally aren't saddle broke, meaning they may not be ready to be ridden.  It really depends on who is selling the horse.<br>  You should never buy a horse on the internet without first going to the actual location and meeting the horse in person.  Would you buy a car off the internet and expect it to be fully functional just because it looked clean and pretty in the picture?  I'm not trying to equate buying a horse to buying a car.  I think buying a horse is a much bigger purchase because of the effort and expense you have to put into them, but you wouldn't enter into a car purchase lightly.  You really shouldn't do that with a horse.<br>  Take someone with you who has a lot of experience with horses and meet the horse before you decide to buy it.|`|ltSsoysVaa	Most that are cheap tend to have something wrong with them.But You can also get ones that are cheap what ppl can't afford anymore and need to sell quick but are very well mannerd and great fun to ride.But you should defo ride the horse a few times and get a vet to check him/her.|`|QPB6e3lVaa	Buying a horse without looking at it and riding it is asking for trouble. Right now, in our area, people are giving away hundreds of horses because they no longer want to feed them. Some of them are wonderful. I would ask a local veterinarian, or horse owner for help.|`|tcw78ZKNaa	It completely depends. <br>  There probably nothing "wrong" with it, but the price depends on ability, and such. You can find a lot of younger horses that don't know much of anything for very cheap. Horses that trained and have good conformation, etc, are going to cost more. <br>  <br>  You can, in this market, however, find some really great horses. I just bought a horse for 1,250$ that is very well trained and healthy.|`|WpsPLKS7aa	Horses are indeed that cheap in most areas right now.  I'm in Fl and I can get a great looking well trained horses for under 600.00.<br>  Prices are at an all time low.<br>  <br>  But, i would never buy any horse without seeing it in person and riding it.  And, if you don't know anything about horses get a vet to check it.|`|8ycAi8Huaa	There a girl looking for a home for a foal on the horse question I was writing to you earlier Good Luck|`|fc68b5dd7135b048e5fa2b3c3ca90c42aa	look at its mouth.
Q4pUDkyHaa	Agreed, they need UVB, calcium and vitamin D.<br>  Sometimes when you begin UV therapy with more than normal amounts of UV to try to counteract the metabolic bone disease, other vitamin deficiencies will surface, esp vitamin A.<br>  <br>  At this point, a normal UVB lamp won't reverse the softshell effect of MBD. It will be too little, too late.<br>  You need a mercury vapor lamp that throws a LOT of UVB.<br>  <a href="http://www.reptilesupply.com/product.php?products_id=435" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesupply.com/product.php...</a><br>  This is one of the best.<br>  You need one of those, a clamp lamp with a ceramic base, and some means of adjusting the distance from the lamp/fixture to the basking site. Make sure the basking spot doesn't get too hot.  90F is OK, anything more is probably too hot for extended basking. <br>  I'd also supplement with vitamins, and feed bone-in whole feeder fish for calcium, at very least once a week.<br>  It's easy to simply get a needle and syringe and inject a drop or 2 of vitamins into a minnow, and offer it to your turtle.<br>  <br>  You'll need to supplement AND get the mercury vapor UV lamp for your little one to make it. They are severely deficient in several vitamins AND calcium. At this point they can not absorb calcium without the lamp AND vitamin suppliments. They need A, D3, and calcium. I'd prefer they get calcium from feeder fish, and not supplements.  Too much calcium too soon will also cause problems with bone growth, and their bones will grow at different rates, causing severe deformation, crooked bones, and crippling pain. <br>  They need D3 to absorb calcium, and they could normally make D3 from UVB, except they are now so deficient, they can't make enough.   <br>  Keep in mind that the mercury vapor lamps aren't dimmable, so you'll need some way of adjust the distance from the lamp to your basking site.<br>  <a href="http://www.petmountain.com/show_product/510303/?utm_source=shoppingdotcom&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=510303#" rel="nofollow">http://www.petmountain.com/show_product/...</a><br>  This one worked for me.<br>  Any questions, just edit your message.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  If your turtle is tiny, they are normally soft until they absorb enough calcium and D3, they are folded in half inside the egg, and sorta *sproing* out. <br>  I'm also assuming you have aquatic turtles, like painteds or red-eared sliders.<br>  <a href="http://www.tortoise.org/archives/chrysemy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoise.org/archives/chrysem...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allturtles.com/turtlepics/Yellowbellied_slider_Trachemys_scripta_scripta0001lr.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.allturtles.com/turtlepics/Yel...</a><br>  <br>  Below is a pic of a soft shell. If he looks like that, ignore all of that, because it's supposed to feel like leather, and not fingernail or bone.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softshell_turtle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softshell_t...</a><br>  They have pointed snouts, and leathery skin.|`|7ZjloThDaa	The turtles need UV light and a calcium supplement. If you just give them the UV light they will make vitamin D but have no calcium to absorb and if you just give them calcium then they will not make vitamin D which is needed to absorb the calcium. The calcium  and UV are essential for good bone and shell grows.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, good luck|`|vS1Z0inOaa	This is a potentially serious condition known as metabolic bone disease (MBD). It means the turtle is not getting enough calcium or vitamin D into its body, and all animals,including people and turtles, need these two things to make their bones hard and strong.<br>     It's normal for baby turtles to have shells that are kind of soft (like leather) but it hardens up eventually, and it should NEVER feel SOFT like...well, funny way to describe it but its the best word I can come up with: mushy. If both of your turtles are about oe year old and one has a hard shell, then the other one is almost definitely sick, and if yo don't take care of it NOW he will eventually die.<br>     Do you have a basking area with a UVB lamp shining on it? Are you keeping the bulb changed out every 6 months or so? Turtles' skin will produce its own Vitamin D when it's exposed to UVB lights, so if you're doing this you don't need to worry about a vitamin D deficiency. Their body will make whatever amount they need.<br>     What kind of turtles do you have, and what are yu feeding them? Their diet could possibly not contain enough calcium, and if you can tell me what kind of turtles they are I can help youmake sure they're getting the right diet. I would recommend you put a cuttlebone into their tank. Just get the cuttlebone like they sell for birds, take the hard backing off it and drop it in there. The turtles will then have constant access to a calcium source and will chew on it if they want to.<br>     However, since one of them is apparently healthy and has a hard shell, I have the feeling you're making the most common mistake almost every turtle keeper (myself included) makes: you're feeding both turtles together in the same tank at the same time. When you do this, one turtle will always get more of the best food than the other. In most cases, the rsult is one turtle grows faster, stronger, and healthier while the other one gradually gets weaker and grows more slowly, lagging behind of the other one. As they mature, the bigger, stronger turtle will use feeding time to show his dominance and eventually aggression breaks out and the two turtles have to be separated. You should always feed both turtles separately in separate bowls. This way there is no mess in the tank, yu can see that both turtles are eating well and who ate what, and there are no fights--everyone gets enough to eat.<br>     MBD cannot be reversed once it has happened. Therefore, your turtle may have some deformities for life... However, if you get calcium into him now his bones will harden up and it will stop the MBD in its tracks, and if he's not too far gone, he'll still have a gret life.|`|Sv4E2o6uaa	maybe its a soft shell turtle
0m6BgESXaa	Teach him an "off" command such as "No feet!"<br>  <br>  When we have large or giant breed puppies come into class, they are more apt to use their feet to get attention than to jump up.  The first thing I help teach is "off" and I treat this the same way.  The puppy paws at me and I say "*gasp* No feet!" and the moment the puppy stops poking at me, they get a cookie.  Within two weeks of the session, when I approach the puppies, they immediately sit and look at me like "I'm being good!  Look!  No feet!  I can has cookie?!"<br>  <br>  Eventually you wean the treats away, and it becomes a solid command where they just remove their foot.<br>  <br>  On top of teaching "no feet', give your dog an incompatible behavior, such as "Iie down!" Hard to put a foot on a leg or hand when the dog is laying down!|`|yLwKWzIUaa	my dog did that for while when she was young. it was because we taught her to give paw, so she thought this was a good way to get treats and did it non stop. that could be what your dog is doing. if that's the case, stop asking for his paw all-together. teach him other things (sit, down, stay, come, etc....)<br>  (you can re-teach the give paw later)<br>  also, when he paws, just completely ignore him. turn your back and walk away. though don't forget to praise when he sits nicely in front of you without pawing :)|`|fFtBqFB6aa	He wants attention.|`|d5YcH69Paa	I know it sounds totally backwards but I cured my girl from doing this by teaching her the "paw" command with seriously high value treats.  Once she was doing it consistently on command I would only give rewards to her when I asked her for the behavior and ignoring her otherwise.  Once she figured out she was only going to get the treat when I asked her to do it she gradually stopped doing it without me asking her too.|`|NTsdSHY7aa	I know this might sound mean, but I have experience. You have to either knee him, lightly if you are standing, or if you are sitting lightly kick him. I know it sounds mean but it teaches him that if he wants attention, he has to get it another way.|`|S5Lz35myaa	Ignore it.  Even a "no" is attention, which is what he is looking for.  If he comes up to you and paws you, walk away from him.  then later, on your terms, call him to you and give him the love and affection he needs.|`|C13Y5s90aa	You have to be stern. Don't let the dog control you
oR0inhGFaa	Just a couple of things to think about...<br>  <br>  1) Are their names complicated? They are more likely to respond to shorter sounds.<br>  2) What tone of voice are you using and are you using a different tone for each rat?<br>  3) Are you training them for agility competitions? Because you might consider using a clicker?<br>  4) How long have you had your rats? Because they will only come to you in time when they are sure of you and feel happy and safe around you, and they'll only do it in their own time, might take weeks, even months. If you've just got them I wouldn't even take them out of the cage yet, I'd talk to them through the bars and let them get used to your voice that way. Then you can introduce yourself by letting them sniff your hands before picking them up but whatever you do, take your time!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little! X|`|RPaHObubaa	Step 1:<br>  Sit on the floor with your rat away from you but within reaching distance so that you can catch him in case he wants to scurry on out of reach. <br>  Step 2:<br>  Call your rat's name and if he comes to you give him a treat. If he doesn't come over to you, put the treat in his line of vision and call him again. Repeat this until he begins to respond to his name or until he loses interest. <br>  Step 3:<br>  Use his name frequently when you're working with him as another way to help train your rat to respond to his name. Say his name whenever you hold him and give him affection. <br>  Step 4:<br>  Go to his cage and when he comes over to greet you, say his name and give him a treat to train him to respond to his name. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also just say her name when you give it a treat or food...<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|aBwk1lsFaa	Take one out, and get a treat for her. Gently say her name a few times before you give her the treat, and say the name when she is eating. Do the same with the other one, and do this until they learn when you say the name, they get a treat :)|`|C75EsUXRaa	I have six ratties and never seperated them to teach them their names and they all know exactly who is who, if I shout titch mitch doesn't come ect. everytime you give a treat say the name of who it is when you hold and stroke one say her name, when you hold the other say her name, they are very quick to learn, don't change their names later like I know someone on here keeps doing, it'll set your taming back, pick a name and stick to it, the more you say their names when you even just talk to them through the bars the faster it will be, another good one is a snack in the day, just stand near cage shout them out of their beds and when they come give it too them if one doesn't come then they get nothing if they are new and timid waft the treat near their hidey hole entrance but don't give it till they come right out to front of cage all the time keep calling their names eg come on   ''bill'' come on ''ben''|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	You really don't have to do any of that. If the rats have short, easy to remember names like Spot, all you need to do is interact with them and use their names in the process. I would always say "Cello" when I would pick up my rat Cello, or say his name when I would pet him. It took several months, but eventually he figured it out. My other rat didn't take quite as long. It really depends on the rat. But I wouldn't waste my time trying to teach them their names when they will most likely learn them in time.<br>  <br>  Also, I would like to share this website with you. It is an online rat forum. It has lots of good information about rat health, housing, diet, and just about anything else rat-related!
AA11776611	Your dog will more than likely be fine. Their stomach acids can handle much more than we can. He may get a case of diarrhea but probably not much else. If he does, canned pumpkin (NOT pie filling, plain old pumpkin) will help to relieve the runs.|`|ZSXstSXBaa	I'm not sure about rotten milk, but my dog got into my trash one day and ate chicken skin, fat, and other yuck that I had cut off dinner a couple nights before and I brought her to the vet and he said she was fine.

Just keep an eye on him.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	If he was going to be sick after drinking the milk, the reaction would have been almost immediate.  When a dog ingests anything that it body doesn't like it either vomits or poops the stuff out as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  More than likely the acids in the milk may give him diarrhea for a day or two... but keep junk like that away from him.  He shouldn't have access to any spoiled food.
0mb78CiWaa	Most long haired cats shed a lot. Especially in the spring and summer. You can give her baths and good brushing that helps with my cat.Pet stores also sell the Furminator it is for cats and dogs. They work great. They are pricey in stores though.

Make sure your vet is sure she has no skin problems in terms of allergies, infections, or parasites.  Then be sure and feed her a really good diet so she has good skin.  You need to make sure she has the best skin possible since people are actually allergic to cat saliva and dander, not the hair itself.  You might also try adding an oil supplement to her food and brushing her daily.  If she is a long haired cat, then you can have her shaved down to 1/2 to 1 inch long.  This should make the shed hairs less noticeable.  You can also keep the door to the bedroom closed to lessen the amount of cat hair where you sleep.<br>  If none of this works and you do have an intractable allergy to cat dander then you can try placing her through a foster society or pet society.   Good luck.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	You have an animal with fur, this is what happens.<br>  <br>  Don't just brush her three times a week, make it a daily thing.

Put your clothes in the closet and don't let them be where she can lay on them.  Use a damp sponge to get the fur off the bedspread and furniture once a week.  Any velvet dresses or fancy clothing need to be hung up in the closet to keep them fur free.  Get those sticky rollers to use on your clothing to get the fur off.<br>  <br>  You took her on as a pet.  The inconvenience of shed fur is part of being a pet owner.  Believe me, it's 1,000 times worse for collie owners.  <br>  <br>  You have to dust to keep up with that.  You have to vacuum to keep up with general dirt there.  A cat requires maintenance as well.

If he has no fleas which could cause an allergic reaction to the flea saliva, then I would try a test on a hypoallergenic food with limited ingredients like California Naturals (switch the protein source of the food you are currently feeding.  If your food is chicken based, switch to a lamb based).  You could also go with a grainless food like Innova Evo or Taste of the Wild Wetlands formula since he could have an allergy to grains.  The most common allergens in food are chicken (just because that is what is commonly used as a protein source), wheat, corn and soy.  You should also add Omega Fatty acids in the form of fish oil to his diet.  I just buy the capsules and poke them with a pin and let the dogs lick the contents.  Don't buy the odorless capsules.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Find the cause. Fleas.mange.over bathing,ringworm? Perhaps it is a food allergy. Where does he itch? If it is just the ears, it could be ear mites or an infection. You may have to go to the vet.|`|AA11244754	then take your pug to the vet and see if they have either dry skin which can be fixed by use of specialized shampoo and condition, OR skin allergies.

Or if you think it might be fleas, start feeding him a small amount (less than a capful for a bowl) of apple cider vinegar in his water bowl.  I did that for mine last year because they kept itching and we tried 2 different medicines and none of them helped.  But we started putting apple cider vinegar in their waterbowls and fleas stopped biting them.|`|l0qZNFQkaa	First  you  should try and see why  the dogs is so ichy.<br>   rule outs are 1. Fleas ! if you see fleas get a flea control from your vet. DO NOT buy those over the counter I have seen to many pets get sick!<br>  <br>  2. Food! if you are feeding a cheap food try to get him something with less fillers in it and no dyes the dye is for us they don't care if it is green or red .. as long as it is eatable.<br>  <br>  3. dry skin! flakes and scabs?  you can use a good dog oatmeal shampoo or talk to you vet's office able a tar base shampoo as well.<br>  <br>  4. there are mite that can make a dog itch and these should be ruled out by his vet. they can lead to skin infections and they make a dog miserable.|`|X1y5fbohaa	it will probably die soon.<br>  my pug had the same problem, then three days later we found him on the floor with a knife in his chest.<br>  <br>  im guessing he couldn't take the itching any longer...|`|dfbc3f35da98132143b605b02d89e5b9aa	saltwater bath. works for me, or an oatmeal bath, had to do that when i had chicken pox|`|WkaMrVVGaa	make him take a bath genuis.|`|6ef0e0ba6af3df8415ccaf3351847985aa	a pill of fish oil mixed in his food|`|e5MQTEMcaa	T@k3 hIm @ B@tH|`|okAYAGvXaa	Better food.|`|2Pp73nEdaa	My Shih Tzu recently had itching problems. When we took her to the veternarian they told us it was due to the ingrediants in her dog food. (i.e. certain types of food colorings, etc.) Some of the ingrediants in dog food are actually bad for them and can cause allergies and other problems. Since pugs are small dogs like Shih Tzu's there is a high possibiilty that it might be due to their food as well. <br>  <br>  The vet gave us this special food for our dog that ultimately stopped all her itching, which was great. I don't think it can be bought at the grocery store though, only at pet centers.|`|Jp3t0ZEHaa	NO  bashful genius the bath could be what caused the itching.
fzaf5t3Caa	Luckily, cats and dogs can't get sick from humans and you can't get sick form a dog or a cat. Don't worry =] you can hold him and kiss him all ya want. It would be hard not to hold my cat I know Lol . Ferrets can get sick from a human with a cold or a virus, but you don't need to worry about your cat. What a nice cat mother you are =) good luck and feel better soon.|`|LVPYnB6gaa	yeah i thought the same thing when i got my kitten because he had a cold and the lady looks at me all crazy and told me that there is no way we would be able to catch germs and virus' off each other. i was very happy to hear that. so i tell you the same thing cats and humans have two different types of germs and virus' and there is no way we could spread things to them and visa versa|`|zGid9wJBaa	No but also if you cough it might startle that cat when holding him!|`|7vJNHaskaa	lol, you're fine don't worry. Most human illnesses can't be caught by your cat and vice versa.|`|KAB1GNh4aa	no its fine, the viruses that humans get are completely different from ones that cats get|`|TZT0SCZSaa	There is almost no risk that anything you have in the way of a virus will transfer to your cat.  Bacteria are much more transferable, so if you are sure it is a virus just follow the normal hygiene rules that you would use for a friend who was visiting.|`|0mb78CiWaa	I do not believe humans can transfer a sickness to pets. You can still pet, hold, and hug your cat.<br>  <br>  Most cat sicknesses can't be transfered to humans either.<br>  <br>  Hop this helped.
0m6BgESXaa	As long as you keep your Aussie exercised and mentally stimulated, apartment living CAN still be possible!<br>  <br>  Do not euthanize your dog just because you're moving.  That's unfair.  I also hate the "must give up because we're moving" thing.  That said, I don't blame a child for that, I blame the parents :-p<br>  <br>  If you choose to put her up for adoption, do this MONTHS in advance (so start looking for a home NOW, and start screening potential people).  You can't expect to find your pup a good home in just a couple of weeks.<br>  <br>  Try not to leave her at the shelter if you can.  2-3 year old dogs are appealing to some (how old is she anyway?), but many people go for puppies first, due to the "cute" factor.|`|PM23RDycaa	You take her with you. Is she or is she not a part of the family? Last time I checked moving didn't mean you still couldn't give the proper exercise she needs. The fact you would even CONSIDER putting her down is appalling.<br>  <br>  She will be happy because she is with her humans.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Go back and read your question.<br>  <br>  You mention putting her to sleep and then say you just want her to be happy.  So, being dead is a good option for her future happiness huh?<br>  <br>  You don't say how old she is, but my guess that her future would be most secure if she went to a shelter where people will check any potential new homes.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	Start NOW with contacting as many dog and breed rescue groups as you can. Also check with friends and family to see if anyone would be interested in her. Don't put her down, sell her (really - who would want to buy a mixed breed dog, no matter how wonderful?), or hope that the local shelter will be able to adopt her out soon. If she has a regular vet, see if  you can leave a notice on a community board they might have set up.<br>  <br>  Also check with your future apartment, as many do not allow dogs, and if they do, there could be a weight/size limit.<br>  <br>  Good luck; I hope you can find a nice home for her.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Take her with you.  If you take her on frequent walks, she shouldn't have a problem.  Other option is to keep her with one of your family members whom you trust.  Don't put her down or get rid of her to some family who may not take care of her like you have.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Take her with you, she would be more happy in an apartment than sold to strangers, she is a member of your family! as long as you take her for long walks she will be fine.|`|AA12322387	Put her down?  How could you even ask such a question?  Let me take a moment to get over that.....<br>  <br>  ...sigh...your dog is fully capable of being happy in an apartment as long as she still gets exercise (walks and playtime).  She is part of the family and wants to be with you.  Her happiness totally depends on you and if you are willing to give her the time that she needs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .....AND to the other poster...I volunteer at a no-kill shelter.  The dogs are walked 3 times a day and get playtime in play groups 3 times a day.  They are healthy, well fed and loved.  Of course their situation isn't ideal but it also isn't permanent.  The alternative for these dogs is death at the local pound.|`|AHF0DR9baa	Please don't put the dog down!  In my experience, they can definitely go on to be happy in new homes if circumstances change.  I know it'll be hard for you to let her go but I would put her up for adoption at a centre near you, or try to find friends or acquaintances who might be interested in her. Just pick someone who you think will be a good match and who will look after her.<br>  If she's a big dog, you're right, she wouldn't be happy in a small apartment.  Though if you have a garden or worked near enough to come home and take her out several times a day - or even if your firm were happy to have her in the office - then it might not be a totally bad idea to take her with you.<br>  Best of luck with the move.|`|7vJNHaskaa	As long as you will have the time and energy to take her outside a lot and keep her mind stimulated, then she should be happy in your apartment. If I were you, I'd take her with you and try it out, see how she reacts and how much time is available to spend with her. If it doesn't work out, you could always try to find a home for her down in Florida. Best of luck.|`|awio5lIjaa	if there is absolutely no way you can take her with you, definitely take her to a non-kill shelter. if you really want her to be happy, why would you think of euthanasia as an option? that would be just mean, please don't kill your dog for no reason.|`|c2wXk6ntaa	Don't put her down everyone deserves a chance to live <br>  bring her with you or let your family take care of her<br>  don't put her up for adoption because dogs in much worse conditions than her are put up for adoption<br>  <br>  Dogs that are abused are put up for adoption|`|qyMc5yOFaa	i agree wit the wolfy dude<br>  <br>  try it out see how it gos if it dont work send him to a good home <br>  <br>  NEVER PUT A HEALTY DOG DOWN (dont think the vet would)|`|Yf1Ig8E9aa	DONT put her down!!|`|d5YcH69Paa	This is going to get ma flamed but please think long and hard before you give her to a no kill shelter.  I mean think about it, your main worry about taking her with you is that she would be unhappy cooped up in a small apartment without enough space.  Do you really want to send her to a place that will house her in a 4x6 box with 1 or more other dogs, given one short walk a day if she's lucky and possibly having to live that way for months or even years?<br>  <br>  If you can't take her with you and you cannot find a reputable rescue that will let her live in a foster home then she's better off humanely euthanized with you holding her, no fear no pain and no anxiety.<br>  <br>  ***I want to be very clear that I think your first option should be to take her with you.  See how she handles the new place, give her some time to adjust to it.  You never know, she may end up LOVING apartment living (more walks, more time with you, etc) <br>  <br>  I just want you to be aware that the thought of a no-kill shelter is generally much better than the reality of it.  Dogs are first and foremost a companion animal.  When they have known nothing but people from birth they are NOT happy living in a shelter for months on end.  <br>  <br>  I have worked at a no-kill, I saw dogs come in that were perfectly lovable, calm, sweet pets slowly deteriorate after long months into screaming, snarling, fearful, shaking messes.  With nothing to look forward to because once they get that bad they are unadoptable.|`|hoDvh61waa	DO NOT PUT HER DOWN! if the dog is old it probably isn't a good idea to travel so far with her in which case you can leave her with family or friends and then you can see her when you visit them. there are these services which will drive the dog to where you're going if you don't want to take her on the plane. apartment living isn't impossible for dogs, as long as the building allows them. Just walk everyday, take her to the park ect. also if you're nervous about the dog not having enough to do doggy day care is a good option.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	I would give her to the family if she knows them & has a good time there.  Have a trial run & leave her with your family & see if she settles in.  You do not want to put her up for adoption if you can avoid it.<br>  If she's with family then you can visit her & get regular updates on her progress.Putting her down is not an option.|`|vTra7n5baa	Find her a home on your own.  Put up an ad in your community paper or around town.  I'm sure a nice, well-to-do family would love your dog.  You have six months so you should be able to do this in no time, but figure out if the family will be a good one or not before giving her away.  If not, a shelter would take care of her well enough, but also look into independent and private dog rescue "farms".  Some of them are breed specific so there might be one that collects Australian shepherds.|`|DwFDF0A2aa	You have four months to find her a home!  Start now! Put an ad on Craigslist with her photo and some information about her.  I can't even believe that you would ask us if you should euthanize her!  Just to inform you, there aren't any vets out there that will kill a dog because its family is moving.  If you bring her to a shelter, she has a chance of being adopted by a family that will love her.  <br>  PS: Craigslist requires a small adoption fee so that animal abusers will not take your dog.  I would recommend $30- $50|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Unfortunately with the current economy this is something that happens a lot right now.  You could take her with you to see if she adjusts well to apartment living.  It sounds like you genuinely care for her and want what is best for her.  If she doesn't respond well to your new environment then consider taking her to a NO-KILL shelter, but you could at least give it a try.  But I think that she would be best off if you can attempt to keep her with you, as you obviously love her.  Good luck!|`|37sNAW76aa	When you got your dog you made a lifetime committment.  This animal looks to you for food, shelter, and love.  If you can stand living in an apartment then she can too.  If you really do not love this dog then by all means take her to a NO KILL shelter, that is NOT the dog pound.  A shelter where she can find a forever home.  All of the shelters in the U.S. are running over with animals now because of the economy (abandoned pets), you might have to give them money to take her, but it will be well spent.  She has been loyal to you, now you need to show her respect and be loyal to her.|`|0S27EvfFaa	NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO DON'T PUT HER DOWN!!!!! THAT WOULD BE THE WORST POSSIBLE THING YOU COULD DO! if you love her, just keep her with you, she will be perfectly happy wherever she is as long as she is with you. plenty of big dogs live in apartments, just take her out for walks sometimes, it should be really nice to walk in florida. Good luck and i hope you will make the right decision :]|`|VXSjZQc3aa	Call your friends and ask if they'd like to have her. Or leave her with the family. Or you can take her with you see how she reacts to the new home.|`|Vk6s6VTAaa	Putting her down is one of your choices?  WHAT??! Just because you don't want her, doesn't mean she shouldn't live.<br>  <br>  Give her up to someone who will love her and not even think of "putting her down".|`|Sk9rNAYUaa	Put her up for adoption!  Or find a shelter that one euthanize.  Or post her on craigslist!  Just make sure you check them out beforehand.|`|yUkFvtudaa	Why would you EVEN think of putting her down??  Yes that may not be the best living situation, but kill her?  Find her a good, loving, forever home!!!|`|ZSXstSXBaa	okay...so TonyDontLikeYou...that was rude!! Personally, I would try to find a friend or coworker someone that you know that will take good care of your precious baby. If no one wants the responsibility of such a large dog (i'm not an expert but i think this is a large breed) then I would find an animal shelter that does not euthanize dogs, shelters can usually do better background checks on possible adoptions than you can as an individual, besides that if you're looking to adopt then you're usually WANTING a dog! Then, if you still can't find anyone, take her with you, try it out for a couple of days, and if she looks miserable being in a small apartment you can always put her in a shelter wherever you move to. I would try to avoid euthanizing her though at all costs. There's also a thing that some shelters do where a person will "foster parent" a pet until someone wants to adopt it to avoid overpopulation and euthanization.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	It's good to see you are thinking about her welfare.  People are jumping on you to fast about putting her down.  I felt that way about a horse once and it was just for his best interest.  I didn't though.<br>  You have so many options so don't worry yet.<br>  First just touch base with a rescue that deals with these types of dogs in or near Florida.  It will be good later if you need them but you might not.<br>  You live in a good area for walking her daily but of course you most likely are not used to that.  I'm not and it would be hard to get used to doing it but I would learn to enjoy it.  Remember you are retraining yourself with this move too.<br>  Start walking her as soon as possible so she get used to this.  Start limiting her free time so it's not a huge change when you move.<br>  Now if you find out that wallking is just not enough for her since she's used to a big yard look into doggie day care.  You wouldn't have to do it every day since it's costly but it would be nice for her to get out and run a few times a week with other dogs and with the walks it just might be the perfect combination.<br>  You might also find a retired person living near you that could help exercise her at times to give you and your family a break.  This would help the retired person feel needed and it would give the dog a new friend and exercise.<br>  Good luck.<br>  Kath

AnhoHRFTaa	Yes, any noticeable change in habit and routine in a cat is worrying.

Just dump your betta bowl (betta included) into a ziplock bag, float him in the 10 gallon tank for 20 mins, and release him. He will be thrilled with the additional space!|`|yoaWcfGvaa	They will be fine, betas can actually live with most other fish as long as they aren't aggressive and don't have long tails  You should be sure your tank is big enough though, plecos can grow to be almost a foot long and need a lot of space to be healthy.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Good idea moving him to a tank. Common Pleco's grow to about 1ft so you'll need to re-house yours if it is the common variety. Although it's probably a bristle-nose pleco which only grows to 10cm max. Yes, they will get along fine.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	if that a common pleco you have then its going to get over 1 foot and should be moved to a 50 gallon before it gets too big, but your betta and pleco should be fine together|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Those two together will be fine.

zqVDJxUIaa	The gestation period for mollies and most livebearers can range from 3 to 5 weeks. I'd recommend you remove the fry from the tank after the parent gives birth, as bigger fish will most likely eat them. The fry should be born in the beginning of March to mid-March.<br>  <br>  (there's also a chance of overfeeding, which causes fish to be bloated, but that's not as likely as pregnancy.)<br>  Good luck with your aquarium!|`|gBYYMKhZaa	i never really no i have tropical fish and they have baby's all the time<br>  you need to buy a baby fish net or they will be eaten by the mother or any other fish you have<br>  the nets attach on to your tank its really easy <br>  keep an eye out for the baby's they will be on the bottom of the tank trying to find somewhere to hide<br>  using a normal fish net catch them and put them in the baby fish net when they grow bigger you can let them back in the tank<br>  i no it wasn't the answer you were looking for but i hope it helps|`|czPzAuSAaa	Don't waste your money on the baby fish net.

34uWa9kHaa	Mastitis is not a genetic issue.  So there will be no effects on the puppy later in life.  <br>  <br>    They would have had to  bottle feed the pups with the mother having Mastitis.   She could have died from that and complications of giving birthday.  Bulldogs usually end up needing a c-section<br>  <br>  Puppies in litters die all the time for many reasons.  It does not necessarly mean there are health issues.  With mom having Mastitis that pup may have been one not getting enough milk because of the infection.   <br>  <br>  I had to bottle feed several litters of pups and all turned out good and healthy no worries.   <br>  <br>  <br>   If the breeder is giving you a health guarantee I would get the pup you want.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I suspect the Bulldog that died may have died from something else.  But hard to say.  How many puppies were there?<br>  <br>  If you are skeptical, you can always get one from another breeder somewhere.  You'll probably be out the deposit.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	this is not a genetic issue<br>  I would not put deposit on another pup from that litter until they were weaned and eating on their own and you are able to tell that they are okay|`|awio5lIjaa	awww i feel so bad 4 u. if i were you, i would probably not take chances with the other pups. i am going to get a puppy this summer and i am getting my yorkie from a place called vanity pups. they have a website (vanitypups.com) but i am not sure whether or not they sell English Bulldogs. you could check.<br>  good luck and i hope the little survivors are okay!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	It is an infection of the milk ducts of the mom.

As long as they got that immune building colostrum milk right after whelping, they are going to be okay..

L22hVXTIaa	That's quite a bit of diarrhea and coupled with throwing up, there's always the risk of dehydration which can be serious.  If he's been drinking adequately, I think I would first call the vet and ask him if this could be a cumulative reaction to the medication.  The vet will let you know if you should bring him in or not.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	keep an eye on him<br>  it is most likely just the dewormer doing it's job<br>  just make sure he eats, drinks, and seems spunky|`|tLObVcPQaa	Well since he has diarrhea he might get dehydrated which is not good. Its most likely not from the worm med. B.c worm med doesnt cause them to have diarrhea. I would take him to the vet Good luck!|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Worming the puppy can cause exactly what your saying. If the loose stool last longer than 5 days call your Vet.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Call to your vet is always free. Mind you, any wormer meds will give your pup runs.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Is this medicine something that a vet has prescribed? If so, then contact your vet and let them know what is happening. <br>  <br>  If it is not prescribed by a vet, maybe this is not the right medicine for the dog. <br>  <br>  Diarrhea for a day is not an emergency. Do make sure the dog has access to water to make up for the liquid that is being lost. If the diarrhea continues for more than a day, then consult a vet.<br>  <br>  Vomiting for a day is not an emergency on its own. Vomiting that continues for more than a day you should consult a vet. <br>  <br>  Vomiting and diarrhea combined for more than a day you should definitely consult a vet.|`|ZSXstSXBaa	When I got my dachshund puppy she got diarrhea from the worming medicine and anxiety. The vet suggested giving her unflavored pedialyte so she doesn't get dehydrated. However, if his poop has been normal all the other times and he's vomiting also, I would take him to the vet. It sounds like your new baby is sick. When they're that young I wouldn't take any chances!!!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	For peace of mind I would phone the vet.  Advice is free.  You could also phone the breeder you got puppy from & see what they suggest.<br>  Make sure puppy has lots of water & try to get him to eat dry toast or dry bread.  A puppy can de-hydrate very quickly.|`|kC7r1fFDaa	TAKE HIM TO THE VET OR YOU WILL HAVE A POO RIVER IN YOUR HOUSE|`|jvURAYDxaa	He certainly could have eaten something that didn't agree with him....anything unusual in his diet today? Sometimes, the stress of medicine alone can cause the runs...especially in a pup.  My pup gets them for no seeming reason at all occasionally, and is otherwise fine. I have found that when I give any of my dogs (any age) a tablespoon or 2 of NONFAT PLAIN yogurt, they think it is a treat, and it really helps their tummy! If it persists more than today, I would call my vet.
gwUMipsUaa	Just take him outside to potty every hour.  Scrap the pee pads, and only use them after he's trained and only use them for when you are gone.<br>  <br>  If I can take my dogs outside to potty every hour when I'm home in ND, you can do it in Chicago.  It's much colder up here than down there.  Bundle up:)<br>  <br>  Edit: M Dog, get your own brain.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't even put sweaters or anything on my dogs, except when we are going to be out more than five minutes or whatever and it's bitterly cold.|`|D7b8pFMraa	Dogs are durrable slap a jacket on him and take him for a walk. They need the stimulation at least two times a day. Also don't use pee pads they are a bad habit use walks. If that doesn't work whenever you are there and your dog poops in front of you give him a gentle slap and put his nose up to the poop. Good Luck|`|YRTYXfggaa	Confine him in a smaller area for him to use the pads the proper way.  He will eventually learn that the pads are meant for both, because he won't want to soil near his bed area.  (Bathrooms/Laundry rooms work well for this).  This is pad training though.  He's not going to learn to go outside unless you start teaching him that now!  (He will eventually learn, but it's a much harder process than when they're puppies!).|`|MpNCNQU5aa	First you need to know the signs when your dog needs to go out. He might go and hide in the other room, he will sniff the ground and pace back and forth and he might go in circles. these are the signs<br>  <br>  then imminently bring him outside to go potty. or were ever you want him to go and tell him to go potty. and when he does then tell him good boy|`|kC7r1fFDaa	train him/her with a puppy pad and if he/she does not follow that rule then put him/her in a cage until they know how to poop on a puppy pad so you will not step in poo every step you take in your house/apartment|`|GxV4jGKMaa	With a dog there is no such thing as "too cold for a walk".  My dog has a coat, because they need to get out a couple of times every day.  Just get wrapped up, and take him out.   Don't get a dog if you're not prepared to do the work!
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	Adults can be fed 3x per week as much as they'll eat in a sitting.  I personally don't think a 10-gallon provides enough room for an adult gecko and the three required hides.  There is nearly zero floor space for walking around.  A 20-gallon long tank is a better option.  Also, a longer tank provides for a better heat gradient and prevents the whole tank from overheating.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	I feed mine everyday.......especially young geckos that are still growing.<br>  <br>  But for adults, once every other day is fine.

Eyawiwc5aa	Many times even when iguana owners leave there igs w/ a babysitter/friend for a week or two igs will miss there slave owners to the point where they wont eat, wont allow the babysitter to hold them, etc.   W/ moving to the basement new environment which could possibly of cause stress on top of you being gone.   If the temps in the basement weren't right regardless if the ig had the UVB, heat it could of possibly gotten to cold also.  I would possibly say that he may of stopped eating and got sick due to you being gone and environment change. Those 2 would be on the top of my list.    Sites for you to read:  http://www.greenigsociety.org/ - http://www.iguanaden.org/ - http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html  A great book to read and have on hand:  Iguanas for Dummies by Melissa Kaplan|`|eS8wuYRfaa	Try not to blame your mom, but chances are it's because of a lack of sunlight.  If they don't get enough, they can't digest their food.|`|wZKb8egaaa	The sun had nothing to do with it if you had a UV light (UVB I hope if not then it still would have taken longer then 15 months for him to die he would have just been very sick). Too much vitamins can kill them, your only supposed to spary their food once a week. So, that or stress is the only reason that I can think of.  Sorry for your loss.

obHUDaSPaa	There are as many designs for a dog house as there are dogs.  Try to find one with provisions for shade outside the house (a porch) unless your yard has an abundance.  Look for a design that has the dog turn a 90 degree bend upon entry so wind is kept out.  Use double wall construction with fiberglass insulation - hot or cold that stabilizes the interior temperature.  Consider dormers you can open in hot weather so a flow-through breeze removes heat.  Don't skimp on materials, you want a nice look - like a shrunken home for people.  And size the interior to the comfort of a dog without being too big, just like kennels.  <br>  <br>  We went all out with all of the above and more.  The dog, however, choose to sleep outside the house except in a downpour.|`|7tDDXKEOaa	You can already buy kennels/dog houses with mats inside (depending on where your whereabouts) so that the mats can be removed. If you're wanting to built one yourself, think about the woods because certain woods will insulate, and depending on how you build it, you could add insulation during the winter. Or have your doggie sleep with you in bed in the winter again if you didn't mind it. Good luck with your house :)|`|kC7r1fFDaa	you can insulate it in the winter and you can fan it with a fan built in to the dog house if hes going to be in it most of the day every day it can also include a door  so hes not cold in the winter|`|51St5GEcaa	If you make a dog house, make it about 5 or 6 inches longer than he is, and wide enough to turn around in.  You can insulate it by making a double roof, sort of like an atic space. There's the roof on top that gets sun exposure, and the roof below it. Like a triangle. This way it won't heat up quickly. Also, paint it white to reflect as much light off of it as possible. These are the best ways to keep it cool if its just a dog house. If it is part of a kennel ( a dog house inside a spacious outdoor pen, then you cover the top of the pen with tarp for insulation. It makes a nice shady area for your dog to sit in the grass unsupervised<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|ndHL0IJpaa	Just wood or plastic will be fine, then lay some straw down and some blankets for him. He will insulate it himself. The thing is, it can't be too big otherwise he will not be able to insulate it. In the summer, keep it in the shade and spray it with the hose (the house not the dog!!!!) and make sure he has water. Like I said, dogs can control their own body temperature well. And paint it white, definately not black! Good luck!|`|z8Zd8Mqyaa	you could use insulation between the walls. another way is to put older carpet in the floor for him. Make sure mom won't mind if you use it for the dog.|`|I38WF5aFaa	A dog house is mostly protection against wind,  rain and snow.  You can make  a very good flat roof dog house from one sheet of plywood and a couple 2x4s.<br>  Rip the plywood into two 2'x8' pieces.<br>  Cut one piece into three 32"x24" pieces.  These are the sides and floor.  <br>  Cut two 24"x24" pieces from the other half.  These are the ends.  <br>  From the remaining piece cut a 24"x36" piece for the roof.  It will have 4 inches of overhang above the door. <br>   Use the 2x4s in the corners for something to nail to. Cut a 10x15 inch opening in one end for a door.  Set it on legs or blocks to rise it about 8" from the ground.  I make mine with removable roofs for easy cleaning.  The dogs like to use the flat roof as a sun deck,  especially when the ground is muddy.  <br>    Straw bedding should be all the insulation he needs.  Dogs lose most of their body heat to the ground.   Don't put a flap or anything over the door.  If its closed  condensation from his breath will make it wet inside.  A dry dog house is a warm dog house.  Place the house so the opening faces away from the prevailing winds.  You don't want to make his house too big.  The dog's body heat provides all the warmth the house needs.  If the house is too big the dog won't be as warm.|`|ALAmdtZVaa	Straw is a good bedding for the doghouse, it's easy to change. Put a few nice blankets in there too because the straw can irritate the skin sometimes. Just make sure you Make the dog house out of wood that isn't toxic to dogs! Other than that dogs can make their own heat for the most part. You could put insulation under the floor of the dog house because the ground will suck out a lot of heat.

But in a few words, this is how it works:<br>  <br>  Your local fish store salesman stands behind you, gets you in a death grip by wrapping both his greedy arms around your submissive, frail body and *HUH* squeezes all the dough right out of you. You will come out of this experience a little light headed and light walleted too ;). Cleansed.<br>  <br>  I guess what I am trying to say is that if you want to breed bettas or keep tropical fish for that matter, you must be prepared to spend some serious dough. Hence, if you don’t have any money, you should reconsider. OK. Last call for the poor and the stingy. Bettas have no time for you :). They are royal creatures that will not condescend to be offered anything less than the very best.<br>  <br>  Still with us? OK, here is the shopping list. On your marks? Set? GOOOOOOOOO!<br>  <br>  The following shopping list and “must have” list is the BARE minimum you will need to spawn one pair of bettas. I have put some approximate prices just to give you a rough idea of what you are getting into :). These prices will vary greatly depending on where you live and who you buy the stuff from.<br>  <br>  The breeding pair: <br>  1)- One pair of younger bettas from a good breeder. Pick a strain easy to work with and not too expensive to start with. $20 to $30 for the bettas and $20 for Express mail shipping costs. Please do not try to save a few bucks by having your pair priority mailed. Priority mail is not guarantied to not go in the unpressurized cargo area of the planes. Many bettas shipped priority mail have EXPLODED while on the planes!!! Please don’t jeopardize your bettas lives and spend the extra $10 to get them there safely.<br>  <br>  2)- Two one gallon glass jars to house each of your bettas. $15<br>  <br>  3)- Water conditioners and additives as follow: Amquel ($9) Novaqua ($9) Aquarisol ($3) PH down—in most cases—($4) aquarium salt ($5)<br>  <br>  4)- First aid must have medications: Maroxy ($3), Methylene Blue ($5), Tetracycline and a few other antibiotics ($5 each)<br>  <br>  5)- Food to feed the little critters: freeze dried brine shrimp ($10), or frozen foods or live brown worms ($1 a portion—you will need many portions over the next months)<br>  <br>  6)- Two fish nets ($2 each)<br>  <br>  Subtotal = $130<br>  <br>  <br>  The spawning tank: <br>  1)- 10 gal or 5 gal spawning tank (same price $20 with cover and light)<br>  <br>  2)- Mini penplax corner filter ($5)<br>  <br>  3)- Small airpump to run the above filter ($10)<br>  <br>  4)- Tubing and valve for above ($4)<br>  <br>  5)- SUBMERSIBLE (and submersible only) heater 25W to 50W no more or you will cook you fish!

Also a 1/2 gal jar with lid to hatch the shrimp in ($1.50)<br>  <br>  3)- About 50 to 100 jars for the males to be jarred when they grow and start fighting ($1 each)<br>  <br>  4)- preferably another larger tank (40 gal) to move them to when they grow, with cover, light, filter, plants and heater (used $100)<br>  <br>  Subtotal = $171.00<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  GRAND TOTAL you will be coughing up after the Heimlich maneuver :):<br>  <br>  About $380.00<br>  <br>  Aoutch.<br>  <br>  This initial investment is the bare minimum to spawn one pair of bettas, that is of course if you want the pair and their fry to live. If you don’t care if they live or not, then you could cut the cost down. (Boooooooo!).<br>  <br>  In all honesty, trying to skip any of the above items will probably cause you to fail in your endeavor. If you try to keep 200 fry in a 5 gal or a 10 gal, they will die of bacterial disease or nitrite poisoning. You must provide them with ROOM to grow and survive. Remember: Bettas may lay as many as 500 eggs! Hence the need for a grow out tank and many jars.<br>  <br>  Hmmmm… You look pale. Are you OK? :))))<br>  <br>  Ah, what the heck, it is only money, and believe me, the enjoyment you will get out of breeding bettas is well worth it.<br>  <br>  Have fun shopping, and don’t let that fish store salesman anywhere behind your back!!! Face him at all time! (hehehe I can already picture you walking backwards out of the store!! LOL)"  End quote.|`|40EotGSlaa	You'll need a shallow type of tank
w1lh1INHaa	Those aren't flea eggs, those are tapeworm segments.  They look like little grains of rice or sesame seeds.  He needs a deworming treatment.  You can get them at the petstore, just make sure you follow the dosing correctly.<br>  <br>  And, tapeworms are transmitted through fleas, so get a good, topical flea medication at the same time.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  No, they won't hurt anyone unless you eat them.  Tapeworm eggs are carried in fleas, so unless you are eating fleas, you're okay.  However, a bad infestation can hurt your cat, so make sure you give him some deworming pills.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Please listen to "pretty kitty".  She knows what she's talking about.  Those "seeds" are NOT flea eggs......they ARE segments of a tapeworm that is residing inside your cat's stomach / intestines.  These segments break off and come out the anus of the cat, when it's relaxed, and if you see them immediately, they'll look like little white worms.  After they've been exposed to air for awhile, they dry up and look like brown rice.<br>  <br>  The ONLY kind of medicine to kill a tapeworm can NOT be bought at a grocery store.  You need to get this medicine from your vet.  Like I said, "Pretty Kitty" knows what she's talking about.<br>  <br>  If your cat has EVER had fleas, or has them now, he'll get tapeworms, and only killing the HEAD of the tapeworm will kill it.  If you have fleas in your house, or yard, the cat can get them again.  You MUST treat your home and yard........and get RID of the fleas, if you don't want the cat to get the tapeworm again.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps........Good luck.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	He does need to be treated for tapeworms but don't go to the store for OTC meds.  Those are basically useless and can even harm your cat.  Go the vet for some real medicine.  If you have a regular vet you may not even have to bring your cat in.  Just tell them you saw tapeworm segments and ask for Drontal.  You'll need two doses- one for now and one for 2 weeks from now.  You also need to treat your kitty for fleas.  Cats get tapeworms from ingesting fleas while grooming. While you're at the vet pick up some Advantage or Frontline. In order to contract tapeworms from your cat you would have to ingest the infested feces of your cat.|`|GmbeNHNgaa	Do they sort of look like rice? If so it could be worms (which most often come from fleas). Either call your vet or if you have to go over the counter for your pet meds ask your local pet store what they would recommend for a dewormer. Don't worry though your kitty will be fine!<br>  <br>  **** Don't worry it is extremely unlikely to spread to humans!! You would basically have to lick the "seeds/rice" in order to contract worms yourself.****|`|vYeS5mYnaa	flea eggs are whitish.<br>  if its flea anything its flea poop. hold your kitty and rub him vigorously on the back of his ruff ( u know the only part he cant reach when he grooms himself) if that stuff fall off, then yup u've got fleas. ask your vet for complete instructions on how to get rid of them. its about a month long process. if your cat is outdoor, tho, dont bother...|`|Qw7ymfakaa	Sounds like fleas to me !<br>  <br>  DO NOT USE BOB MARTIN STUFF<br>  Get something from your vets to treat both your home and the cat, it wont cost alot more but WILL work and wont be dangerous on your cat either.<br>  <br>  The fleas cant hurt you or your family although they could bite which isnt nice, dont panic though its easily sorted|`|AA12063605	Yes it does sound like flea eggs--is he scratching? If you take a fine tooth comb and comb his back down by his tail or on the side of his face under his ear--this is where fleas hide alot--this will tell you if you see any in the comb. The best and safest flea medicine is advantage from your vet--kills them on the cat and all the stages of the larvae (eggs) in your house--good luck!|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Those are flea eggs give him a good bath with flea shampoo and get some Frontline or Advantage you can buy these from any pet store or Vet office. Fleas for some reason like to nest right above the tail or in how can I describe this it will be like your arm pits but on the cat instead.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	You need to get some good quality worming tables/syrup for the cat and make sure any bedding is thoroughly washed and dried in the sun.<br>  <br>  Don't use any aerosol sprays near the cat as this can really hurt their eyes and nose.|`|gYLkvAnjaa	It's tapeworms.  Your vet will be able to give your cat a dewormer for tapeworms and a small cost.
RwQmN7Reaa	If it doesn't get infected it could live a healthy life. Animals don't take pain like humans do, animals can adapt to living very well with only 3 and even only 2 legs. The biggest thing that you need to watch for is infection, but in a mouse it's going to be hard. Good Luck!|`|GLDZz7aWaa	As long as it's other three legs are healthy, it should be fine. Don't touch it, just let the leg heal. The mouse is young enough that he'll probably never miss it - he'll just have to learn how to move around using his other legs a little more.|`|8YrqeCPQaa	I think he will be just fine, my mouse whim i've had for about two years now is missing his right back leg. He does fine, he runs on his wheel, and it's like he doesnt even know he is missing a leg!|`|hMZdgcImaa	Yes, it can live a decent life. Things will get well very soon. <br>  <br>  Its happens sometimes. She will be able to walk normally.|`|lUwuVgiWaa	I was actually just talking with a co-worker and he said he had 2 rats (I assume all rodents probably fair the same) and one of them got a leg caught and pretty much came clean off and actually lived to be older than the other rat. <br>  <br>  So the missing leg didn't seem to bother her, I am sure the baby mouse will adapt. I would worry more about infection than how well he/she will get around. Maybe call the vet and ask if there is anything you can put on the leg to help keep it clean.<br>  <br>  You can even name it Tripod :o)|`|JupzNzeoaa	Well I have had a plastic cage and w/ that cage<br>  I started my first two mice! Well I also have<br>  two cats!!! whiskey (my  cat ) loves going in there so I trusted him** Bad Idea well he knocked<br>  them of my dresser I took three days looking for it  I caught them both but they got knocked over three other times I could not stop him<br>  but one day I heard them screaming well the <br>  brown one got away the white one got her front left paw brocken and his right cut because whiskey atacked him soo that mose acts  diffrent  than   it  used too it screams and runs around her cage when I changed her food<br>  and when I took her out too exercise she couldnt do much at all like keep her self warm  so I got two more and a new  cage     they have made her better than befor  Sorry that I talked soooooo much but <br>  I re named her FEARLESS!!!! and Fearless is fine soo yourse will probably act a little different than all your others so I would treat her w/ a little <br>  extra care <br>                                      p.s if you want to you <br>                                      can write me on yahoo<br>                                      I am 12 years old!!!<br>                                      at    lexie_dunlop@yahoo.com|`|KhjpmxGeaa	Just as long as it wasn't his back leg,If it was then he could have trouble in the future,As if getting around and other things.I would take him to the vet when he was developed hair and see what The vet says.
N6NunLGVaa	omg my puppy does the same thing! with the car you really cant do much. what my mum does is let him sit on her lap. it makes him more comfortable. but on long trips is a crate cause he gets sick 2 :/<br>  <br>  the howling thing its ganna take about 2 hours or more. your going to need to walk out the door and when he starts to howl walk back in. it lets him no that you will come back.<br>  <br>  and tug of war cant really teach that. they will do what they want :/|`|G4hCoeWoaa	I don't like you can teach a dog to play tug a war . But try giving him some attention when you come home.|`|KxjUim7yaa	No wonder he dribbles. He is afraid in the boot. So he howls when you leave the house. He will get over it and stop. Most dogs play tug of way when you dangle a rope toy in from of them. Playing tug of war can invite aggression.
QaXEkf1xaa	I have that tank....no it does not come with the habitat inside of it...you can purchases habitat kits seperately|`|8opg5OSQaa	Nope sorry you can buy the other stuff though, for an EXTRA 30 bucks|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	No, just the background. all the other things inside of it are exo-terra products that you have to buy separately.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	No, except the rock background. It would have said in the side bar. Beautiful gecko choice by the way, I would get one too but I hear they are loud and quite agressive. Good luck.|`|shGB91Jiaa	no, it comes with the background but not the bowl or plants or you know the random chameleon
vS1Z0inOaa	Sure and sure! That'd actually be cool. Just don't feed the two turtles together at the same time in the tank. It's better to feed them both separately in a separate bowl.|`|p4kex5J7aa	55 gallon is fine for 2 babies.<br>  They can be kept with the mentioned fishes however, one day you will find your fishes dead. While most fish sleeps at night your turtles (even babies) can swin there easily and taste them ^^;<br>  <br>  Gl with them :)
pYF9KnNeaa	Two weeks is pretty quick to expect them to be settled in.  Yes, they most certainly will tame down but how long it takes depends on too many things for me to be able to give you a time frame.  Mostly it depends on you, how much time you spend near them and how you go about it.  You need to spend as much time as possible, near the cage and down on their level. (Predators hover over birds so don't do that, at least not any time soon.)  For sure, do not be trying to reach in the cage to get them.  That will only keep them frightened of you.  With birds, we have to gain their trust before we can form any kind of bond with them.  I suggest you do a search and gather all the information you can about proper diet, (they cannot live long on only seeds) and check out lists of all the toxins you have in your home that will kill birds.  Spend time reading all of it and learning what you need to know, as you sit near them.  Heck, even read some of it to them as that will help them become familiar with your voice.  After they seem to be less afraid, start opening the cage door but allow them to come out, only when they are ready.  It's not a process you can hurry.  We have to move at their speed, not ours.  Good luck with them.|`|MWFsONg5aa	yea i used to have a budggie that would jump  on my hand whenever i said step up<br>  it was so cute<br>  it might take 2 weeks tops<br>  i would use millet to train it birds love it<br>  also i you get on youtube and type in training your budgie it will help a lot<br>  <br>  thats what i did|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Two weeks is really way too soon!  Give them time, they will respond to you on their terms!  They need to learn you are friend, not foe!  Talk to them softly, sing to them, just get them used to your voice and let them see you are there for their good.  Don;t rush it or it will never work!|`|SytfXV6Haa	Budgies (parakeets) can definitely be tamed. It does take time, effort and patience to achieve this. Simple things that you can start with are just being around your budgies' cage so that they'll get used to the sight and smell of you. You can read by their cage, have their cage next to you while watching TV, and you can sit and talk to them. This will slowly get them used to you, and to trust that you are a part of their flock. After they are used to you and trust you then you can start to work on getting them to Step up on your hand, offering treats and toys to them. And don't get discouraged, you will get bit while working to tame them.
EWXzNyk8aa	Not sure about Schnauzers in particular, but many dogs have gums which are part black and the rest is pink. So it could really still be mixed with anything.|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	No they don't have black gums.
VwxX8kDRaa	My favorite way is actually using a baby gate.  They each have their own side and are held and comforted there until they stop barking or hissing.  Then you step back and watch them interact.  They can both check each other out at their own pace without being able to harm each other.  (The alternative is you being between them)<br>  <br>  Then, when they accept each other, the cat will feel secure enough to jump over and you can remove the gate.  Of course this could take a few days if they don't hit it off.<br>  <br>  I've done this a few times with adult pets and it's always been very easy and uneventful.  Knowing that they won't get into it will make you calmer, and therefore them as well.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to use dominate energies so that they both know that they're expected to behave.|`|SGymwcmoaa	Sit them both down and tell them a story about a dog and a cat. It must have a happy ending of course. Then shoot them both and do them a favour. Its a dog and a cat, they'll deal with it the best way they know how.|`|2nsNvIanaa	get someone 2 hold dog on leed. u hold cat in a towel n slowly get closer but watch out u will get scratched.
uvYWR8u0aa	get a hamster, they are so cute!!! plus they don't bite like guinea pigs|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	well u can get a snake. or a reptile. theyre cool looking. but guinea pigs smell kinda bad...theyre okay though. i wouldnt get any mice or fish cause of the cat, obviously, so i guess u'll do with a guinea pig. but seriosly, u should get a snake. my science teacher has one and its cool looking....once my teacher got a death mouse in front of the whole class and made the snake eat it...it looked pretty nasty|`|4Sc3FAwUaa	If you are looking for an animal to get along with both your cat and dog get a ferret. I've had ferrets, cats, and dogs since I was a little kid. And I find that ferrets get along really well with both cats and dogs. My ferrets adore my cat and love to play and harass him, and while my ferrets and dog are extremely playful with each other, they definitely love that cat more. I say ferret would be your best choice.|`|1ZT39UkWaa	ferret!<br>  <br>  they DO NOT SMELL if they're looked after and kept clean. They are also very affectionate and my grandad's one even learnt a few simple tricks lol<br>  It loved the dogs for company (he had 2 jack russels and a labrador) so if you introduce the ferret to the dog and cat slowly they should all get on fine :)<br>  <br>  good luck and let me know how ya get on xox|`|skslxcvPaa	I'm surprise that you're buying a pet.

Z9kCzIkyaa	He's probably just a chirper|`|i2ZfXHmWaa	There are many reasons your baby parakeet could be chirping. Some of them may be serious, but it probably because it simply likes chirping! In fact, parakeets like being next to people unless they are scared or frightened. Your baby parakeet probably has no health situation. Also, check a veterinarian. Good luck with you baby parakeet! Try to make him one of your best friends!|`|vjijiJT3aa	usually it's because they're hungry
EJpiaCMQaa	Male baby parakeets have translucent pink ceres, which may have a bluish or purplish tint.  Female baby parakeets have opaque white covering most of the cere, especially around the nostrils.  It often has a light blue tint.  Also, males will chirp and sing more than females.|`|yMbw0Osnaa	what colour is the cere?it is possible to tell the sex of young budgies it is possible to tell the sex in a baby.if the cere is pink it is male!|`|i2ZfXHmWaa	If the cere is pink on a parakeet, it will probably become a vetrenarian.

D5wZLk6faa	The temperature can be anywhere between 72 and 85 degrees.<br>  U don't really need to worry about the ph level in a 5 gallon Betta tank as long as u do weekly water changes. If you do partial weekly water changes of 25% then u will need to do a complete water change once a month.<br>  U can use tap water or betta water especially made for them, but there is nothing wrong with tap as long as u put the water conditioner in it to neutralize the chlorine, chloramines and heavy metals that are harmful to fish. I use AquaSafe. This also helps the slime coat on the fish.<br>  Best water would be the water for the Bettas, but tap water is completely okay as long as the water conditioner is added.<br>  Medicating the water? I am assuming u r talking about the water conditioner. Whichever water I choose to use I still add the water conditioner regardless as it helps the fish's slime coat.<br>  Number 6 on ur lil list of questions I have already answered, however, I would like to add that you should purchase Aquarium Salt to the tank as it aides in keeping your Betta from getting some common Betta diseases such as fin rot.

o93EwErKaa	To minimize your chances of your dog getting parvo, the puppy would have to be at least 17 weeks old and have at least 3 parvo injections prior to being exposed.<br>  <br>  Yes, your daughter can bring home the virus on her clothing and shoes and it can only be killed by bleach or another virucide.  It is very hard to rid a home environment completely of parvo, but there is a product called KennelKare that you can spray on most fabrics and carpets.  If the dog was only outside, then I would suggest bleaching the yard with a mixture of a cup bleach to a gallon of water in a sprayer and discarding all bowls, beds, etc.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Parvo can live for up to a year or two if everything is not disinfected properly.  Yes, it can be carried on the clothes, especially the shoes. You walk into a "parvo home", and you have parvo on your shoes that you bring home.

A vet once told me that dog's can catch the disease simply by sniffing an infected dog's poo and that the virus can live in the ground for up to one year.  Either wait for some time to get a dog, or do not allow your dog to visit the relative's house for a while.  Even vaccines are not 100% effective and for puppies especially, parvo (as you know) can be deadly.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	What you are asking about is how long does Parvo survive in an environment and still remain contagious? <br>  <br>  Here is a good info page on Parvovirus<br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1556&aid=467" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  <br>  The second paragraph says the virus can last up to five months or longer.

Wait  it can live 6 months -2 years in grass and dirt. and the rain can wash it out again and again.<br>  <br>   the parvo vaccine only protect so far. they need a set of 3-4 to be covered fully .<br>   I recommend adopted an older puppy like 6-7 months that has had 3-4 sets of vaccines  before bringing it home just to be safe. <br>  <br>  Good luck parvo is mostly a puppy problem.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	By the time you get the new pup the dog that has the problem will either be cured or..............<br>  I do not see any chance of the new puppy getting this from this other dog.  First the dog has to do it's business in your yard, house, kennel, etc.. for the parvo to be present.  If the dog has never been to your house than I wouldn't worry.<br>  If so lime your yard way before the new dog comes since lime can burn there little pads but kills parvo.<br>  Parvo can stay in the ground for years I've been told but I've never heard of a dog catching parvo off of a human that's been around a dog with parvo 2 months earlier.<br>  Remember vets are exposed to this all the time and just a shower and change of clothes is the fix so he doesn't give it to another dog.  <br>  Just to be double sure I would make sure the new puppy has his shots no later than 2 weeks before you bring him home.<br>  Once the sick puppy is over parvo he can not give it to the new puppy.  I wouldn't let them play right away together mind you but after 6 months I wouldn't worry at all.<br>  Have fun with your new puppy and I wish the sick puppy the best.  It's curable.<br>  Kath
GxV4jGKMaa	My dog had the same behaviors.  I took him to the vet and blood work was done.  He has thyroid disease.  It caused the extreme fatigue and lack of appetite.  It also caused brittle hair and skin.  He's on thyroid medication now.  It's really inexpensive medication.  He's back to his old self, just by taking a pill every day!|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Well you didn't mention that she was young.. Usually dogs do that sort of thing when they get old.. Sorry.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Your dog could have an ear infection, or her ears could be infested with mites.  In addition to that, I think she likes you, but she is sick and doesn't feel well - that is why she's acting the way she is.  I'm not trying to be mean or cruel, but if you cannot afford to take your dog to the vet when it gets ill, then you should find another home for her.  Your dog sounds like she's suffering and even an ear infection can travel throughout her body and possibly kill her.  If you love your dog, you will have to find a way to get her to the vet or take her to the ASPCA and surrender her so that she can receive the treatment she needs.|`|24CFl7sjaa	The brownish dots might be the start of ear mites so will need checking out, do the ears smell bad? If they do then I'm afraid thats a trip to the vet for some drops.<br>  As to her recent behaviour, have you made any changes at all, even something simple like turning up the central heating? It could be something THAT simple ie, she is too hot and needs a drink.<br>  Does she still enjoy her walks? Is she happy to see you return from time away from her? Is she just feeling more settled in her new home and doing her own thing? How is her appetite, is she drinking ok? Is she bored?|`|6NVHuQAWaa	Is she still a really young puppy? Did you just bring her home? If you just got her she may be missing her mom and her litter.

Actually, she is much more than fine, she is the baby :)|`|BDRIeLqUaa	sounds like she may have an ear infection- please try to see a vet- or at least pickup an ear cleaner from the vet and learn how to clean the ears- it may help, but won't cure if it is an infection- that will need meds from the vet|`|awio5lIjaa	well first of all how old is she? because i hear that some puppies about 8 weeks old or maybe a bit older idk can whine in the night because they are scared of the night and the darkness and the new home. as to the following you around, maybe she just grew out of it. maybe the reason she goes downstairs all the time is because there is something that smells bad or scares her upstairs. no clue about the brown in her ears, and if she is lethargic you should see someone, if not a vet then take her to the breeder and see if they can find anything wrong.<br>  good luck and hope this helps!|`|GrYhFNMdaa	If she seems very different then usual, then there could be something wrong with her. If she needs to have a check up...you do take them. You make sacrifices and find a way to take care of your responsibilities.

Rw7gi86Naa	Here are some suggestions to your litter box problems:<br>  - Provide a box for each cat <br>  - Provide constant access to a box <br>  - Go back to previously used brand of litter and/or <br>  - Discontinue new disinfectant <br>  - Move box to where it was previously used <br>  - Eliminate new or frightening noise near litter box <br>  - Move food and water away from litter box <br>  - If cat is only going in one spot, put the litter box at the exact location and gradually move it back to where you want it at the rate of one foot per day <br>  - If there are several places, try putting dishes of cat food in those areas to discourage further elimination there <br>  - Experiment with different textures of litter, (cats prefer sandy litter) <br>  - Use a covered litter box for cats that stand in box but eliminate outside of it <br>  - Keep in mind that some cats are rather picky, and prefer to have two separate boxes, (one to pee in and one to poop in).<br>  <br>  Problems arise when your cat doesn't like or develops an aversion to the litter box that you have provided. There is absolutely no reason to expect every cat to like the same material, or even for one cat to prefer the same material over an entire life span. If your cat is having litter box problems then you will need to figure out how to make the litter box appealing to the cat. Here are a few options: <br>  1) Pain or illness can cause a cat to stop using the litter box. Cats are very adept at hiding illness, so if your cat is having litter box problems then the first thing you need to do is take the cat to a vet for a medical exam. <br>  2) If you aren't scooping the waste out of the litter every day then you need to start and start now. <br>  3) Perfumes or other odors can drive your cat away from the litter box. Scented litters are unacceptable to many cats, and the leftover scent from a cleaning product could also be a problem. Get rid of the perfumes, and scrub those cleaners away before giving the box back to the cat. Remember that cats have an acute sense of smell. <br>  4) Your cat may feel vulnerable when in the litter box. Is it in a noisy location, (such as next to the washing machine). Is it secure from little marauders like dogs and children, or even other cats? If the box is not semi-private, move it to a better location.<br>  5) Remember those preferences that we talked about earlier. You may need to offer several different types of litter before finding the right one. Strange but true, some cats will not use the same box for urine and feces, in which case you'll have to provide two boxes. The type of box could also be a problem. If the box has a cover, try removing it. <br>  6) Anxiety can lead to litter box lapses. Did some event scare your cat? This could be anything from a new couch to a new cat or even a new person in the house. If you suspect anxiety, confine the cat to a safe and secure place, (maybe a bed room) until the anxiety has passed. Cats seem to hang on to their emotions, so the anxiety could last much longer than the actual event. No need to rush, leave that safe haven available to the cat for as long as possible. <br>  7) If you have multiple cats, chances are you'll need multiple boxes, maybe even with different materials in them. <br>  There is one more important distinction that you'll need to make. Is the cat refusing to use the litter box, or is the cat spraying? Spraying is a territorial behavior and has nothing to do with disliking the box. For more information on litter box problems or spraying, consult with a trained behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Correcting the Problem <br>  The key to solving elimination problems is to make the litter box more attractive, and the area where the cat is soiling instead, unattractive. Sometimes, just cleaning the litter box more frequently or changing its location will correct the problem. Other times, you may need to experiment with different combinations of location and kitty litter to find a solution. You may even want to offer your cat the choice of several different boxes, each with different kinds of litter, to see which he or she prefers. At the same time, you must break the cat's habit of soiling in the new location. Be sure to clean the soiled area thoroughly with a pet odor remover to get rid of any urine scent -- or your cat may be attracted back to the same spot. It's important to keep the cat away from the area. Try covering the spot with carpet runner, prickly side up, or use a device that delivers a harmless static shock or that produces a loud noise when the cat comes near, to help redirect kitty to his litter box. Adding a room deodorizer with a scent the cat finds offensive - such as a strong citrus or floral - can also keep the cat away from the area. <br>  <br>  When to See the Vet <br>  If your cat continues to eliminate outside of the litter box, a trip to the vet is in order to check for health problems. No behavior techniques will help a cat with a problem that requires the attention of a veterinarian. <br>  Urinary tract infections are a common cause of litter box probl|`|DQlZIzAFaa	any changes to the household? have you moved furniture? added or lost another pet? is the cat sick? cats usually don't use the litter box if they are stressed for some reason. he could be sick.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	One of our cats had the same problem this lasted for about 3-4 weeks and we tried every thing and one day she went back to using the box.

61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	Yup. Our youngest cat is a half-Siamese that we call our Litterbox-trained Golden Retriever. Compared to our sedate Maine Coons, she is a holy terror, and a blast at the same time. Her favorite toy is a rolled up piece of paper that she chases, and her favorite target to torment is our fattest cat. Our dogs play rough with her and she loves it, oftentimes chasing them into their own crates to get away from her.<br>  <br>  Siamese are hoots.

Do u know how mother cats carry there kittens from 1 place to another? They hold the kitten by the neck. Dont hold the kitten to hard, dont hang the kitten while ur holding by the neck either. Just go near it slowly and pick it up. Now, hold the neck and see what it does. If it meows let it go, but if it does not, start to pet it until it purrs.If u go to walmart or target, in the cat aile, there are some ponce treats u can buy for ur cat. U can train ur cat and make it do tricks. While u go to work or shopping to buy somethingfor the cat or rself, put the cat in one room and give it plenty of toys, water, cat food, and plenty of attention. <br>  Iam happy to help.<br>   <br>  :-9
aGynBPbCaa	I think so, because in an appt. situation if the landlord doesn't want dogs, they have to go.  Its up to the 19 year old to realize that.  Sounds like a spoiled brat, poor puppy...|`|KxjUim7yaa	Legal question for a lawyer in your area. Since the grandmother won't allow the dog and the 19 year old lives with the grandmother, there shouldn't be a problem, but I am not a lawyer|`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	Okay, the dog is locked up 90% if the time ~ this is a form of animal cruelty;  if the 19yr old does not have time for the dog and the grandmother can not handle it then either one of them should not be partaking in the dog life.<br>  <br>  Beside caring for a dog;  food, water, and shelter there are other means of responsiblity.  Contact your local SPCA and or Humane Society, ask them how this situation should be handed.  Get advise from them so when you do go into this situation;  one you are prepared and two you have all your facts/information straight.<br>  <br>  If the original owner refuses to allow you to take the dog then simple specify that she is not properly caring for the dog by locking it up just because she does not have time.  <br>  <br>  If she agree's to allow you to take the dog be sure you do it right and legally.  Make sure she signs over all rights so if there are any questions and or mind changing you have a legal bidding contract... <br>  <br>  Also, if you are first introducing the dog to a child, never leave a dog unattended w/a child no matter what but it will take a few days of visually observing the dog around children before a definite determination can be made, don't go by just a couple of minutes in the same room....|`|f4RnGIeSaa	The owner of the home is not the owner of the dog.  It would be the same as your child giving away your car just because you were parked at her house.<br>  <br>  Now the home owner can call the pound, but they can not give the dog away.<br>  <br>  Get the 19 year old to agree for you to keep her.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	This sounds like a power struggle between the grandmother and the 19 yr old (who is technically an adult).  If the kid were renting, the landlord would have no power to give the dog away, so I would hesitate to get in the middle of this situation without the owners consent.  <br>  <br>  I would make sure the owner agrees to your taking the dog, and maybe have her sign a contract of some kind, just to make sure she doesnt try to get the dog back later on. <br>  <br>  People can be so selfish, sometimes - I used to board my horse at the house of a girl who owned a beautiful, big Polish Arab.  She never rode the horse, or even turned him out.  Half the time she forgot to feed him (I made sure he was fed every day, while I was there.)  <br>  The horse was so bored and miserable that it pretty much ate its way through the wood fencing.  But she WOULD NOT sell or give the horse away - he was "hers". And the parents would not force the issue :o(|`|jvURAYDxaa	I would call the local cruelty organization in your area. Being kept in a cage clearly falls in that category. That poor dog needs to be rescued right away. They will require the dog be signed away, or they will seize it. Then you can adopt it legally. Short of that, find out how to get in touch with the 19 year old, and if possible, reason with her about her decision to let her dog live its life in a cage. Whatever it takes, I would find a way to get that dog out of there....even if you have to get legal advise to make sure you don't lose the animal once you have rescued it. Very best of luck!<br>  P.S.   If for any reason you don't feel comfortable with your 2 year old....get the dog out of there anyway. He would be better off in a no kill shelter, if necessary, where he can be adopted.|`|nbR8z1OQaa	If the 19 yr old has a dog license, then this can be tricky. Call your state Animal Welfare league. crating an animal 90% of the time is cruel. It also teaches them to not trust humans. They are social animals and need contact. I would politely talk to the 19 yr old and the grandmother and explain if the kid really loved the dog, then she would want to see the dog go to a loving forever home that will care for it the way it should be cared for.|`|bbdOikOqaa	The 19 year old is being extremly selfish,. if they cared about the animal they wouldnot keep it in a cage or spend any time with the animal.

jyGTlpzTaa	Chinchillas are much more hard work and cost more but they are more intelligent and interactive pets than hamster...basically you get what you pay for, to your hamster you are just a warm interesting tree to climb whereas a chinchilla will really recognise you. I'd go for chinchillas in a snap over hamsters, way worth the extra money, plus they live up up to seven times as long as your average hammy!|`|7AI58IS8aa	Hamster- If you want a cheap, easy to take of, low-maintenance, then get a hamster. They are really cute!! They love stuffing food into their pouches, and they are so adorable when eating. They are the easiest animals to take care of. <br>  <br>  Chinchillas- They need more care, attention, and maintenance. They are also bigger, more expensive. <br>  <br>   so which pet you will decide to get depends on how money you are willing to spend, how much time you have, and room.<br>  <br>   Goog Luck in finding ur pet :D|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	They both make awesome pets but for different reasons..<br>  <br>  Hamsters are great if yo want a pet which is inexpensive, do not need alot of attention and are not a long term commitment.<br>  <br>  I have 2 Chinchillas, the main thing you need to know is they are very expensive to buy and to maintain. They also live for 20 years!!! so if you are 13 now are sure you will still be able to look after the chin in your 20's and 30's (through college/ career/ marriage/ children).<br>  <br>  For this reason I would say go with a hamster for now and if that works maybe in the future have a chinchilla.|`|JxIKUC9baa	it depends on what your looking for<br>  <br>  Chinchillas:<br>  Cuddly<br>  expensive<br>  big<br>  cute<br>  <br>  Hamsters<br>  small<br>  energetic<br>  cheap<br>  cute<br>  <br>  So what are you looking for cheap energetic or expensive but cuddly. its up to you|`|51St5GEcaa	neither. Get a couple of rats. you can litter box train them and they are really smart. You can teach them so many tricks! They are more cuddly than a hamster and they rarely bite.|`|S5utPIrgaa	Hamster all the way!!! They are both cute but hamsters a much easier to take care of and less expensive!|`|A9YEnUw6aa	well i personally LOVE chinchillas. i really like hamsters too though. chinchillas are definantly more expensive. i babysat my brothers 2 chinchillas (ive also had hamsters) for a little over a week one time and one of them was super energetic and social and he would climb all over you and the other one, he didnt like to be held, he would always just sit in a corner and be by himself. the unsocial one died several months ago..=/<br>  and chinchillas can live for quite a while(not always..lol)<br>  and the only reason i dont have chinchillas of my own is because they need atleast an hour of exercise outside of the cage everyday and you have to be watching them and you cant put them in a ball or anything..but what we would do sometimes is put them in our basement(it wasnt really a basement..more like a playroom)and make sure they couldnt go behind any big pieces of furniture and put towels under the door cracks and just let them run around for while we would watch a movie or tv or play video games. it was just kinda hard to catch them when it was time to put them up cus they can run fast

AA12322387	Because it should have never had, "owners" in the first place.|`|Fe1Z7fpbaa	a wild animal has no owner. a chimp kept as a pet has a cruelty-giver who locks it in a cage, puts a nappy on it, occasionally lets it out into a completely unnatural space and deprives it of everything that makes it a chimp.<br>  you know anyone who got killed by their "pet" chimp? GOOD FOR THE CHIMP!!!!!! chimps can never be tamed, a wild animal will never become a "pet" !!!!!!<br>  your an ape. how would you like it if i locked you in a cage? <br>  ANYONE WHO HAS TRIED TO KEEP A CHIMP AS A PET MAKES ME SICK AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Why does a tiger go crazy and kill its owners? Because it is a powerful wild animal with powerful, wild instincts, that cannot live in a domestic environment because it is so big, powerful and wild. Simple really.|`|XI2iylR4aa	Because they shouldn't HAVE owners in the first place.  They are not pets!|`|7ZjloThDaa	Chimps are very powerful wild animals. No matter how trained it is and how "human" it seems it is not domesticated and will act based on its wild instincts. People who keep them as pets are not properly trained to care for these amazing animals and do not have the space and ability to properly confine them. Just because they can "act human" and eat at the table and wear clothes and do things humans do do not mean they will not react wildly (normally for them) to things that scare, startle, excite, confuse or stress them. Primates never make good pets. Below is an exserpt from the site of Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary about the treatment of baby monkeys that most people who buy primates don't know or just ignore so they don't feel bad about buy one. <br>  <br>  Jungle Friends discourages the keeping of primates as ‘pets’ and we hope the practice of stealing baby monkeys from their natural mothers will end. Baby monkeys are literally pulled from their protective mothers, sometimes when they are only three days old, to be sold as ‘pets’. It is not hard to imagine the horror both baby and mother monkey must feel during this traumatic and forced separation. Sadly, it can take a lifetime for the grief-stricken mother to come out of a depression brought on by this thievery and there are always scars left on mother and baby from such cruelty.<br>  <a href="http://www.junglefriends.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.junglefriends.org/</a>|`|l0ksum3naa	This is a wild guess here, so who knows if I'm right or not.<br>  <br>  First off, if anyone has been paying attention, there have been many accounts of chimps, orangutans, and monkeys going after their owners, or owner's friends, or strangers.  More often than not the animal is getting older in it's years when this occurs, making it even more strange because of the fact that it should be "mellowing" out in it's older age.<br>  <br>  In that movie Grizzly Man, the guy who went and hung out with the bears every summer eventually got killed, you guessed it, by an older grizzly bear.  I think there is a similarity between the monkeys and the bear in this situation.  It's a sign of desperation.  Survival instinct.  Even though the chimp had been domestic for a number of years, I think as it became older it became aware of it's mortality and loss of virility.  In the wild only the strong survive, and all wild animals on some primal level know this fact and react accordingly.  Basically it became afraid of death and looked at people it once welcomed as potential threats.  Sorry i got bored!haha|`|p7CCJx1raa	because they are miss treated and all they do is make people laugh.<br>  most of the time they are treated badly and dont want any more so they get all crazy its not the chimps (or animals) fault its the owner or trainer most of the time.|`|zGid9wJBaa	Because Chimps live in the wild and this isn't there natural habibtat!<br>  Also the one on TV the lady had it on Medicine!|`|oGVWdnHraa	Chimps dont have owners, they have people who keep them locked up, chimps are wild animals and do not belong in cages, being treated like someones dog.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Chimps, just like tigers, lions, bears, etc. are WILD animals. They aren't people and they weren't raised to know civility and decency like we are. They have their own natural insticts and will react differently when they are threatened then humans will (sometimes). They have no bearing on the consequences of their actions or have any thought about what they are doing when they go bananas (No pun intended). The bottom line is...They are wild animals, not humans. Same thing with the idiot that get on the bad side of the tiger at the San Francisco Zoo. I think it's time people realized that most chimps aren't the adorable, banana eating, companions that most TV shows depict them to be.

aeonmRR2aa	Slimy white string is NOT sperm or eggs, it is unhealthy poop.<br>  <br>  It can just randomly come out of fish.  But it can also be a sign of an internal infection such as intestinal parasites.<br>  <br>  If it keeps happening, check for other signs like lethargy, white marks or 'holes' appearing on the head, finrot, bloatedness, hiding, clamped fins, etc.  Or you can just treat with an anti-parasite medicine such as Jungle Anti-Parasite Food (or Tablets).  Anti-parasite medicine don't bother biofilters (at least, these ones don't) but may kill invertebrates so if you have pet snails then be sure to read more about the specific medicine you choose.<br>  <br>  Also, check the water chemistry - make sure nitrates are low.  You may also want to do a 25% water change and treat with activated carbon instead of (or before) treating with a parasite medicine.  Unhealthy water makes unhealthy fish, and unhealthy fish are more vulnerable to diseases.<br>  <br>  You can also try feeding your fish a wider variety of food - crushed cooked peas, lightly-steamed spinach, oranges, brine shrimp, homemade gel food, etc. to make sure they are getting proper nutrition.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hmmm, you might try this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.fishyfarmacy.com/symptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishyfarmacy.com/symptoms.htm...</a><br>  <br>  I think I had a better one but I can't find the bookmark.|`|6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	Sounds like the coloring agents in the food are just passing through them.You can tell eggs if they are laying them .

5a30eb5b89b12b5040c830a843bda7d6aa	Yes Siberians are hypoallergenic.  I made that discovery in 1996 and went on national TV along with my vet and stated so on a HGTV show called *In the Company of Animals"  Those that vehemently state that there are NO hypoallergenic cats, are confusing that  word with NON-ALLERGIC.  The Siberian is hypoallergenic but it is NOT non-allergenic.<br>  <br>  If your parents don't want to spend the $$$ then there is nothing that you can do until you are old enough to buy your own Siberian cat.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	No cats are completely hypo-allergenic to everybody.  Allergens are produced in cat's skin, saliva, and urine so even the hairless cats have potential to cause someone's allergies to flare up.  Cats of all breeds produce more or less allergens and it's a toss up as to which cat would produce less of what your dad is allergic to.  "His" cat may be a shelter cat who doesn't produce allergens that affect him or it might be a purebred.  It's cat specific so unfortunately the only way to find a cat he can live with is trial and error.  A good allergist can help with medications to calm his symptoms.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic cat, dog, horse, etc. Any breeder that claims their cat/dog is hypoallergenic *should mention8 that little Giant Fact, then add that perhaps it is because that breed gives off less dander.<br>  <br>  Most, if not all allergies come from the skin (dander, as in dandruff), not from the fur or hair.<br>  <br>  A solution that works with my sister, who has three very allergy-sensitive children, was to get a cat as a kitten (I offered her one of my last Maine Coon kittens before I stopped showing and breeding cats), and this little kitten was bathed once a week with pet shampoo, and brushed. She loved (and still loves) the attention, and having been bathed since kittenhood, tolerates the water so much that she is known to jump into the bath with the children.|`|qBV4OX6faa	Why dont keep ur dad away from a cat u might by.

Sphynx don't have hair, so they may be tolerated too.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Supposedly they are billed as hypoallergenic because their dander lacks a protein that many allergic people react to.  That is fine if that is the specific thing that triggers the allergy, but not fine if it's not.  There really is no truly hypoallergenic cat, not really.

Just remember that once you spike the water, the water will grow bacteria faster so just make enough that she will drink in a short time and remix it fresh again, if needed.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Nothing is wrong. She is drinking water whether you see it or not. A dog can't go without water. She is getting water, you just don't see it. <br>  <br>  A lot dogs drink water on the street. That is OK after a good rain because the water will be clean. If it hasn't rained, don't let the dog drink water on the street because it could be dirty or have chemicals like antifreeze.

PEPWFGNGaa	It depends on the horse. I will use a dandy brush on clipped parts of my horses as those seem to be the bits they most like to scrub the mud into - using a body brush would take so long it would annoy the horse.<br>  But my daughter could never do that with her pony - he used to buck if she tried, she ended up scrubbing the ground in mud off with her hands.<br>  I use the plastic curry on the unclipped bits.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	if a horse hair is really short you should use a soft brush <br>  when a horse has thick hair its okay or when a horses hair is normal length you can use a curry comb<br>  <br>  but if you do use it be very gentle|`|sX17XtVWaa	Yes sure,just be gentile on the bare spots|`|40EotGSlaa	be gentle :)|`|tlp1huSSaa	Yes. It is okay but make sure to be carefull some horses are ver sensitive like my thoroughbred and minis but my app and one mini gelding dont mind it and enjoy it actually I would just use a soft brush if it bothers him/her but if it doesnt go ahead and curry away|`|Y07hleOzaa	It is okay.  Just be especially gentle.  Brush repeatedly, however, until you get all of the dirt off.  Plastic curry combs are okay, but be careful.  Dandy brushes are better.  Try to see if you could get a slightly softer brush.  That would be better.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  :)|`|D7b8pFMraa	Yes but it is not necessary. Just use a soft dandy brush just to get the top layer of dirt off and that's about all you need. If there is a difficult muddy spot then gentle use the plastic curry!|`|yNHBBQ6faa	softer brushes are advisable as harder brushes can be sore. it's best to use soft brushes on horses that are clipped to avoid any discomfort on be half of the horse.|`|3GeJ50SWaa	Yes it is ok, just try to be as gentle as you can. Depending on the hair Lengh. Horses are not all that sensitive so it should not both her/him.|`|UcMCdlJSaa	yes just be gentle with him and if he is touchy when brushing anywaythen i wouldnt.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	yeah i do it all the time.  It's like a massage.<br>  You have to be careful on the horse's bare-ish parts, because you don't want to irritate the skin :)<br>  But yes, dont worry about it.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	of course just be gentle
SytfXV6Haa	Have you considered a donkey/mule? Mules are really good to have around for trail rides, showing and other things that horses are capable of. Donkeys have also gotten the reputation as being good guards for keeping farm animals safe, as well as a great companion. If you're not looking to gain profit from the farms animals, have you considered possibly adopting some of them? You might want to look into a donkey or a mule as an addition to your farm|`|0fKQhIX0aa	i dont mean to be rude but do you know how to take care and tend to each of these different animals and their individual needs?  many people move from the city into my county b/c they want to "experience the farm life". but the animals suffer because of it.<br>  <br>  also do you have the time and money to take care of all these animals? and to clean up after them.|`|v97747Npaa	It really depends on the money you have. Cows and horses can be up to $1000+ Per year. But they are very loyal . Sheep Are Great. And Chickens Produce Great eggs. If You Will Be Selling Eggs That Is Good.

689974ada7bde2f5215c9931047f0747aa	You may wanna take it to the vet and have some x-rays done just to make sure there isn't any plastic in it's digestive tract.  Then I'd make the dog food company pay for the x-rays.|`|VwxX8kDRaa	Yes, go have X-rays and keep the piece of plastic.  The company's trying to cover it up by taking it back.  Personally, I wouldn't try to get money from them (though you could), but I would contact the media for the purpose of warning others and holding the company accountable for dealing with the situation - ie recalling that batch of food.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Take it back to the Store & complain... Maybe you'll get your $$$ back... -There's always hope...  :)|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Legally they are liable for being negligent.Personally l would contact your press and inform them of what happened and they may or may not print the name of the manufacturer as l can assure  you they will not contact you.You are entitled to another pack but do you want to go there again?|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Do not allow them to take the package with the plastic in it. You could sue them for having the object in the dog food. And by you giving the package to them they take the evidence of it happening with them.<br>  <br>  Contact your vet and ask them what a piece of plastic like it would or could do to your dog. Also I would change brands of dog food if you can afford a different brand.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Do not stick with that food, even if they try to give you another package.|`|uhlPVTdkaa	get your dogs to the vet soon.and sue the company|`|4RK6R66zaa	gosh that's terrible.<br>  you definitely should stop buying that particular product. If the plastic was in one can, why wouldn't it be in another? <br>  <br>  I think the company telling you to simply buy another Package is, in a way rude and not really taking responsibility for the welfare of your pet and others consuming the same product.<br>  <br>  In case your dog has ingested some of the plastic i would keep an eye on him and if you notice anything considerably strange you should consider taking him straight tot the vet just in case.<br>  <br>  good luck getting them to contact you back and i hope your dog is okay.

Yup, he actually ate sheetrock when we were gone once.  We 'assume' he was anxious for some reason, or maybe heard a mouse in the wall or something.  The wall he has never bothered again.  The floor rug in the living room, we replaced it, only to have him chew on it in a matter of weeks again.  I won't tell you what happens when they poop out the long cording on the back of a rug... yuk!!!

It was really humorous to see she would grab a large night crawler hold it between her front paws and chow down a bite at a time. She truly enjoyed them and we truly enjoyed her.

AA11736483	Only ignorant and uneducated people think it is ok for cats to roam outdoors unsupervised. The fact is that domestics cats are in great danger when released outside to fend for themselves. <br>  Dogs and cats have the reasoning power of about a 3-4 year old. Would you throw your 3 year old outside for the day or the evening unsupervised? Of course not.|`|bl8co4hUaa	Or for chasing cars, leaving large piles of poo in neighbor's yards, and tearing up flowerbeds. *G*|`|IuYekkPVaa	In the UK, the situation regarding trespass was clarified in 1971 and cats once more became "free spirits" under the law. Cats were excluded from the definitions of "livestock" and of "cattle" under the Animals Act 1971, "they cannot be held guilty of trespass under civil law and, therefore, their owners or keepers cannot be liable for any damage done".  The law simply recognises that cats are less likely than other animals to cause injury to people or damage to property.<br>  <br>  The UK is rabies free and has no natural predators of cats, which is why it is considered a healthy and relatively safe lifestyle for them.  The indoor-outdoor lifestyle is one which is advocated by vets and animal rescue organisations alike.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	All my cats are indoors. So are the dogs.  <br>  <br>  But cats are less likely to run up and bite someone.  Dogs will.<br>  <br>  Cats help keep the rodent population in check. Dogs chase cars, kids, anything that moves.<br>  <br>  Cats don't make too much noise unless they're getting ready to mate or fight about mating.  Dogs can bark nonstop because they are pack animals and want to be heard.<br>  <br>  Think about it, if you saw a stray cat, it would run away.  If you saw a stray dog, who would be running?<br>  <br>  But cats can kill songbirds, dogs just chase stuff (most are too slow to catch wildlife)<br>  <br>  Dogs left to wander don't last long because they don't have the hunting instincts bred into them (usually that instinct has been bred OUT) unlike cats, who can catch stuff if they haven't been declawed (and the crafty ones can even if they are).<br>  <br>  The long and short of it is that domestic pets are not wild animals and should not be left to fend for themselves.  That's why they've been domesticated!!!|`|G7SL3YuLaa	Because cats are more independent than dogs. Although some people say that dogs are loyal to their owners, cats are to but in a different way because they know there surroundings and can go for miles and come back to home whereas dogs have to be taken out for walks and you have to clean up their business. Cats can be trusted to do all of this without human help. I love dogs just as much as cats. But i have 2 black cats and they can go anywhere they want; I don't have to worry about my cats because they can be trusted and are much more independent than dogs.|`|pK7saLw4aa	because cats won't destroy everything|`|HDWJy4WXaa	Cats are actually not owned fully.

MGfBOuUNaa	yes, vets give you the choice and i really REALLY hope that something will go right and you cat will have a second chance at life, good luck! and if he is not taking medicine and that's the Only reason he will be put to sleep than ask his vet if there is some way you can get the medicine to his stomach. GOOD LUCK! and if anything bad happens...... than kiss the kitty goodbye and pet him it will ease the pain! and remember that he is Always with you, in the morning you may feel him sitting by your side. Again GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!|`|KOtMicRKaa	At almost every vet you are allowed to be with them as they are being put down, i have had my dog put down by the way so i know how your feeling about it.

Best wishes.|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	I'm pretty sure you can... but I think most people kinda say good bye and wait outside.... A few years ago, we got our 13 year old Jack Russel (a tough one I might add. 3 snake bites, run over by a car, and still lived to be 13 1/2.) put to sleep. My dad took her to the vet while my mom and I were at my brother's soccer game. Before we left, my mom told us to say goodbye, but we never suspected what was going to happen. I'm pretty sure you can wait there, but personally, I wouldn't. I was crying like a baby just watching Marley and Me. Its gotta be bad watching your pet die. But it would probably make it easier. Check with the vet before you make your decision.
OFpl236faa	Have you considered adopting an older Border Collie? Raising a BC from puppy to adult can be difficult, even for experienced people. Border Collies go through some fear period stages that can be difficult to work through and they are very energetic and get into a lot of stuff. Since you have never had a dog, I would really consider looking into one that is between 9 months to a year and a half. <br>  <br>  It is good that you want to get into all these activities, but all those take a ton of training and patience. Plus are you sure you have time for all of them? I just ask because we do agility with our Jack Russells and Border Collies and it takes most of our time. Do you have a place in your town where you can run the dog? Just a basic walk doesn't do much for these guys. I would also suggest looking into clicker training. It's a fun way to teach your dog tricks.<br>  <br>  I would come up with a plan on exercising the dog because boy are you going to need it or else they drive you batty. I would get together with some breeders, owners of Border Collies and maybe hang out at some agility and herding trials. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have done your research, but generally I do not recommend Border Collies as first time dogs because of their energy and individual needs.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	First a lab isn't going to be any more mellow than a border collie - I have had both, and they are both remarkably high strung.<br>  <br>  Border Collies are fantastic dogs for anyone who has time to exercise a lot. They learn quick, are social and absolutely beautiful. <br>  <br>  they can be destructive if they are not exercised regularly (daily), and they can become bored if they aren't given enough of a mental challenge. Seeing as how you are interested in agility or herding, then you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Any breed is a big responsibility, but you sound pretty prepared for something high-strung that needs mental stimulation. <br>  <br>  Border collies are lovely dogs. Best of luck with your puppy!|`|uTvMXhaOaa	go for it!<br>  my first dog was a border collie. my vet said that they are very full of energy and in need of exercise and long walks. they are great companions too. they will love you no matter what! <br>  if you have the time and patience...do it!|`|hbj6vGE4aa	You sound really prepared for the responsibility of owning a BC.  Border collies are soooo smart, attentive, willing to please, biddable...the only reason I wouldn't tell a first time dog owner not to get one is because they have a *lot* of energy.<br>  <br>  If you are prepared to exercise and spend a lot of time with the dog, go for it!|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I think you can definitely have a Border Collie as a first dog if you are prepared to spend a lot of time mentally stimulating it, which it sounds like you are.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Hav|`|gYLkvAnjaa	Border Collies are very smart and energetic.  You would have no problem owning one as long as you are 100% commited to long daily walks, plenty of exercise, and stimulating activity like the agility you suggested.  They're great dogs and great pets, you just have to realize that they get bored easily and need plenty of exercise to keep them from getting bored and destructive.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Normally, I wouldn't suggest a BC to people as a first dog because most people haven't thought it through.  They hear that BC's are smart and trainable and want one, but they haven't given much consideration to what the dog needs to be happy.<br>  <br>  YOU seem to have done your homework though!!  It's refreshing!  <br>  <br>  So I say, follow your heart ... and good luck keeping your new baby off the furniture lol.|`|0pVXLyGhaa	I think it's better to follow your heart and get your "dream" dog.<br>  <br>  And you do seem prepared for the tremendous amount of exercise that a border collie will need.  <br>  <br>  In addition, dogs are great for companionship, so I think you will enjoy your new dog very much.|`|7vJNHaskaa	It sounds like you are definitely ready and able to care for a Border Collie. Just because it's your first dog, doesn't mean you have to get a mellow dog like a lab, especially if you're prepared for the challenges you can face with a BC. Good luck!|`|amJ7EcD1aa	Go to the pound and see what your like, spend a lot of time, don't hurry or you might not like what happens, you'll know when it's the right dog. Border Collies are quite energetic and need plenty of exercise!!  But if it's what you want, GO FOR IT!! <br>  Hope I helped.|`|jSZIgBYGaa	A border collie was my first dog and she has lived for almost 15 years now she's still alive, and i think they are very compatible with your circumstances. By the way i love Sea Kittens|`|4pmlfiYwaa	Sea Kitten., I love the personality of a border collie. They are so sweet.|`|d5YcH69Paa	You've thought it all out, weighed all the pros and cons so you're already way ahead of most people that run out and buy a pup from a BYB or puppy mill.  <br>  <br>  I don't think you can every be fully prepared for the dog you bring home, they're all different.  I would say go for it, if they're the breed that you've always dreamed of you would always be a little disappointed if you went with a different breed.  <br>  <br>  Remember almost any dog problem can be fixed by an owner with patience and total commitment so as long as you have plenty of both you'll do just fine.

After a couple days at the vet's. he was back home again.<br>  Vet said he was probably eating bugs and spiders in the basement during the time.<br>  So check with your neighbors on the othe side of the block where you live.<br>  <br>  I do hope he comes back on his own.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Well one thing is that cats ALWAYS find their way home if you had recently adopted him from other people he may be trying to look for his old home, just keep looking though and if you did adopt him call the people you got him from! best of luck!

It doesnt matter if you only have one, in fact thats worse cos gerbils are social!<br>  <br>  If you want to buy a big, cheap home for your gerbil get a big fish tank...you can get ones that leak (bad for fish, fine for gerbils) cheap or free if you check out craigslist and gumtree, and create a wire mesh lid for it...you can fill it with deep digging material and your gerb will be happy.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Absolutely not. Sorry.<br>  <br>  This cage is not appropriate for any animal to live in permanently. It should only be used as a travel cage.<br>  <br>  One of the best set ups I've seen for gerbils, is a 10g aquarium, with a tank topper.<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751774" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  Gerbils are extremely active, and need room to run.

You could only take a few steps in any direction....not a good match!|`|SzGyWKsPaa	In my opinion, definitely not. It's just not a good home for a gerbil. To start with, it's very small. It's also a wire, plastic cage. Gerbils can chew up plastic, and those cages don't let you add a lot of bedding without making a mess. I would recommend you get her a 10 gallon tank with a tank topper or wire, mesh lid.

How long has the tank been set up, is it cycled? I say do an ammonia test and tell us what it read.<br>  I would do a 30% water change and if he is swimming upside down then it could be swim bladder disorder. Are you feeding floating flakes? If so, switch to sinking pellets so he will not suck in air when he eats from now on. Fast him for a few days and if he is still not swimming normally, then take green peas, shell them and feed it to him, give him a pea a day until it clears up.|`|oG5HNFUOaa	My advise is to talk to one of the workers in whatever pet store you got it from, or do some research.

Are they all English teachers!? About your dog: You can always find objects to train your dog agility. I have a small yard as well, but when I want to have fun with my dog, I put up various things and lead her through the course. Agility IS expensive, so you could just make up your own obstacle course, using stuff like old tires, cardboard boxes, hula-hoops, bales of hay, plastic or metal pipes for jumping, etc. Just use your imagination and enjoy! : )<br>  <br>  Edit: To those of you saying things like " If you're bored you shouldn't have a dog!" or "You're immature!".

xq2J2LMSaa	Yes, unfortunately.<br>  If they have never been gently handled by humans before, you can have a lot of problems with them.<br>  But try this:<br>  If possible, get a small cage separate from the cage the rats are housed in together.<br>  find some liquidy food that they really like: try sweet potato baby food, or one of the dessert baby foods. You want something sweet, but without too much sugar, because you don't want them getting diabetes.<br>  One way or another, without hurting the rat or handling it too much, get one into the cage.<br>  Put some of the chosen treat on a spoon and near the door of the cage, with your hand near the door and under, but not touching the spoon.<br>  Do not let the rat pull the spoon into the cage, but make it eat the treat near your hand from the spoon. Stop the training and get the rat back with its buddies.<br>  As the rat stops resisting eating the treat from the spoon near the door in a separate cage, try putting a couple of fingers under the spoon and getting the rat to eat from there.<br>  Slowly, over days and days, move the spoon further up your hand into your palm. Don't continue moving until the rat is comfortable.<br>  Eventually, if the rat is calm around you, try putting some of the food directly on your hand. Only do this once you are confident the rat will not bite you.<br>  Stay calm, always. Rats take their cues from their environment. If you are nervous, the rat will be too, and will more likely bite.<br>  Good luck!|`|YAPEpa5baa	That all depends on if they were socialized to begin with.  Otherwise, yes, they can be.  Young rats can adapt to you sooner.  Older rats can be distrustful depending on where they came from.  If they came from a good home and were well socialized and handled - they could make better pets than younger rats who weren't handled and socialized.  So it all depends.<br>  <br>  I am not selective when a rat comes to me needing a home.  I hope you give the older rats a chance too.  Some of them make fantastic companions.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	I have already answered your first question, but it depends.<br>  If they have not been handle since they have been young it is MUCH harder but not impossible.<br>  Young ones will almost always become tame very quick.<br>  Sorry =(<br>  Hope I helped.|`|knFrwCxcaa	i have two rats and they are about 2 years old and their the same old rats as i knew them at 3 weeks yh you can still train them i do

JGq9rKBOaa	The all-brown hedgehogs you see are probably the wild ones that frequent gardens in the UK and drink milk from saucers and have children's books written about them.<br>  <br>  African Pygmy Hedgehogs, which are the only ones I've ever seen on the pet market, will be significantly smaller. I'm not sure how much my last one weighed, but he fit comfortably in my two cupped hands. <br>  <br>  I think the only way you can get an idea of how big a hedgehog will be when fully grown is if you see the parents at the breeder. If you don't get him from a breeder, you'll either have to guess at his adult size...or obviously you'd already know it if you get him as an adult. Some breeders might have larger "breeding stock" than others, although I don't know of anyone consciously trying to breed larger hedgehogs.<br>  <br>  If you see any particularly heavy African Pygmy Hedgehogs, they're probably just overweight. In hedgehogs obesity can be disastrous to their health. A lot of the pictures of pet hedgehogs on the internet look on the chubby side to me.<br>  <br>  So basically, sorry to burst your bubble, but you probably won't be getting the giant hedgehog you're hoping for. I have a secret fantasy about getting a 50 pounder who'll walk on a leash and terrorize small children, but it just isn't meant to be.|`|CDM8yvmCaa	throw some bread and milk out onto the lawn.

8owlj2xHaa	Do you have enough live rock? at least 1lb per gallon. Do you have any bio media in a filter? if so remove it. Bio media converts ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate must faster than the live rock can convert the nitrate to nitrogen. If you have at least 1lb of rock per gallon than you have more than enough surface area for Aerobic bacteria and bio media is not needed. This is common problem with new to the hobby folks. Also if you have any sponges or things to break bubbles rinse them out in chlorinated water at least once a week. These things will also build up aerobic bacteria as well .   Water changes are only good for very high nitrate problems. If your nitrates are at 15ppm and you do a 25% water change you only lowered the nitrate to 12ppm.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Water changes are the most sure way to get rid of nitrates.<br>  What kind of filtration do you have? How much rock? Is it cured? Live sand? Do you have a skimmer? If not, get one. If yes, get a better one.<br>  You can set up a refugium. How old is the tank? Was it well cycled?<br>  I need more info.|`|YnCUyvK7aa	Are you using a protein skimmer?  If you're planning to keep corals, I'd strongly suggest that you do.  You don't mention the size of your tank, but you can find skimmers for smaller tanks, even a Prizm for mid-sized tank or a nanoskimmer for very small tanks could help.  If you have a tank that's larger than 30 gallons, get the best you can afford.<br>  <br>  What a skimmer does is they create a stream of very fine bubbles, a size which can't be achieved in freshwater. As food and wastes break down, they first become tiny protein molecules before they completely break down into ammonia, then nitrite, then nitrate. The small protein particles attach to the outside of the air bubbles made by your skimmer and they're pushed up through the skimmer to a collection cup where they're trapped. The fine bubbles made by the skimmer is how it gets the other name these are known by, foam fractionaters. The *foam* separates the nitrogen waste portion, or fraction, from the rest of the water.  So having a skimmer will remove what becomes nitrate before it has the chance to do so.  Other than using a skimmer which will help to reduce the nitrite, they can only be removed by water changes, or by macroalgae.<br>  <br>  You can also help control the level by making sure you have adequate water movement to keep particles of food and waste suspended in the water so they can be removed by your filter, not end up in a dead spot with low water movement behind your live rock, to not overfeed, and to remove any dead organisms, plant or animal as soon as you find them.|`|2ca2ae314300ec8a2641b57de1558cb8aa	+1 to birdman, need way more information to correctly get an answer to this. From the sound of it the tank has just finished cycling. The xenia is more apt to be effected by the nitrate then fish would be , fish can do well in 30 or less  nitrate levels so would be no worries there, nitrates will drop with Water changes, use of skimmer. If your using a sump and a wet dry or canister filter then the use of chemi pure will  also work wonders for nitrate reduction.  many many different products out for chemical filtration that work to remove nitrate

L22hVXTIaa	Have the vet check out his ear.  He may have a yeast type infection (which is pretty stinky).  It can be easily cleared up with medication.|`|gwUMipsUaa	How often are you bathing him?  Are you cleaning his ears properly?  He should only be bathed about once a month.  Otherwise his skin will dry out, and his oil glands go into overdrive, causing a stink.  As for the ears, have him checked for ear infections, and talk to your vet about how to properly clean his ears.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Does he have dirty looking ears inside?  Is the smell definitely coming from the ears?  He may have an ear infection or mites and you should take him to the vet to get it checked out.  <br>  <br>  We have a female shih tzu and she too has a strong odor even though she's bathed regularly.  The vet and others have told us that the oil in their skin that distributes to their hair to keep their coat soft and smooth is what causes the odor and that there's nothing really to do about it.  It's especially prevalent in Lhasa Apsos and Shih Tzus.  The more you bathe them, the drier their skin, the drier their skin, the more oil they secrete, the more oil they secrete, the stronger the smell.  Kind of a vicious cycle.|`|aa9d27c85ed3f0f7e6df9c7ffea20a79aa	Yes! I know exactly what the problem is. I have the same breed and believe it or not; it's the eyes that really smell. These dogs are prone to excrete tears that stain the hair about their face and can also if ignored create eye problems that can lead to blindness. You have to clean just around the eyes with a tear solution from any pet store. Use a cu tip and soak it with the solution. Carefully wipe around the eyes but do not go into the eye itself. When you have done that then you must take a cloth soaked in warm water and wipe again the same areas. I hate to say this but this should be done once every day. It doesn't stop when they get older so be prepared for the dog's lifetime to do this or your medical bills will soar.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Ears or anal glands. Only clean ears with ear cleaning solution or you can make ears worse. Also some diseases with the kidneys can cause bad breath. Vet could help you best.

Try giving him filtered water as sometimes tap water can make the tears smell.  You can also try a half a tablet of tums every other day for about 3-4 days, doing this will also help with the red staining.  Hope this helps.

2ca2ae314300ec8a2641b57de1558cb8aa	a 24g tank could house an anemone however it would be extremely difficult to maintain the proper water stability that they require to live, most perish within 90 days of introduction into a home aquarium Even in large scale advanced aquariums they generally do not have enough biological stabilization to keep one until the tank is at least 6 months old. You can have a lot of success keeping both soft and lps corals in a nano tank and they can be just as impressive if not more so then some much larger aquariums however sps coral is not recommended for small aquariums due to the amount of flow and nutrients required for them to live, it can be done just not advisable and only with advanced aquarist|`|H06PtiIAaa	metal halide you can keep BTA anemones with no problem, you can go with LPS and SPS corals.<br>  <br>  the rose bubble tip anemone is great and very easy to care with the right lighting which you have, they will also host with ocellaris clowns. <br>  <br>  For corals, i like the LPS like hammer, torch, frogspawn. always in my aquariums. <br>  <br>  You can also go with SPS acaporas and montiporas.
Id6rD4uuaa	It may make you look silly, but as soon as you see the dog finish his business outside be overly-overly happy with that, pet him or give a small treat.

3BMBZtDxaa	Just talk to them. If you don't be rude and be polite, they'll be more likely to listen. Just go over there and say "I noticed your puppy outside. I don't mind that he's out there, but I'm a tad concerned. It's been below freezing weather lately and I'm worried that he doesn't have much shelter." If my neighbor said something like that in a polite tone I'd be more than happy to respond and take in suggestions. You must remember that most people don't like being bossed or treated like a little kid. So if they open up, give them suggestions, don't tell them "do this, do that".<br>  <br>  If they do open up, just suggest them getting a dog house and putting a heat pad in it so he can stay warm. Maybe you can offer to help them build one, or if there are local kids see if they want to. There are dog house plans online I believe and so you can just go to the local department store and buy some wood and build it. Then you can get the local kids to help paint it so that way it's a lot cheaper than the $100+ ones that are sold at pet stores.<br>  <br>  Most likely they don't realize dogs need adequate shelter thinking the dog will be fine or they don't have the money to pay for a dog house. So by offering to help out, you can help out the puppy. Then you can place old towels inside the dog house and get a heat pad so they can heat it up and put it in there at night when it's freezing outside.<br>  <br>  Just offer advice and help and be polite. I'm sure if my neighbor came up and did all of that I would be very happy!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PM23RDycaa	What does being a rottweiler have to do with anything? We had one as an inside dog and she was just fine. Suggestion go over and ask why they aren't providing the animal with proper shelter if they are going to house it outside.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't care if I was intruding, the animal does not have protection from the elements. Otherwise call animal control and see how they handle thinsg when it involves pets on the military bases.|`|UEHsqSaTaa	Defenatly talk to them. Tell them that their dog is freezing it's butt of and in the summer it should be inside some times too because of fleas and it could get bloaded. Do whats right for the dog it's depending on you! =)|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Have your husband handle it.  He can report it through his chain of command and they'll take care of it.  Base commanders HATE that kind of thing.
enC9TvxUaa	-Sure you could, but don't over fertilze them- miracle grow works well for bird saplings, without burning the root system of the egg.  Depending on the pot you put the eggs in, could end up with a VERY large chicken tree with chickens falling off day and night for months!  <br>  <br>  Seriously, did your teacher not tell you anything while giving you the assignment?|`|AA11640918	Sweety, putting eggs in soil is for crockadile, alligator, cammen, and other reptiles. Thats how they incubate there eggs.<br>  <br>  Chickens incubnate there eggs by sitting on them. They will sit on them for 21 days. You need an incubator or a broody hen to hatch them. No heat lamp will work.<br>  <br>  Do MUCH more REASEARCH please!.<br>  <br>  You can but one at tractor supply company or ebay. Or getsomeone hyou know to hatch them for you.\<br>  <br>  You need to also have a brooder to keep them warm for the first few weeks. If you have any questrions email me at bethbethani@yahoo.com|`|b6do0Je7aa	Uhhh hello chicken eggs need to be in an incubator or under a hen potting mix wont hatch them. Also if u are using shop eggs they wont be fertilised.
agwxFmITaa	Do you have a nice surname?  If you have perhaps you could call him that and add  Achilles.   Try it out.  You could also check online horse sites to see what other people have used - this might inspire you.  The small problem with using Achilles is that you would need to be looking at words like 'Troy' which would not have a very good ring about them.|`|3b9960db548159b1919b3abaa1e21f99aa	Hero's Welcome<br>  Achilles' Frost<br>  Iliad Lad<br>  Troy's Hero<br>  Achilles' Storm<br>  Chilly Achilles<br>  Heroic Measures<br>  Achilles Courage<br>  <br>  All I can think of... hope one helps! :)|`|PPoCaJEEaa	Do you know what his sire or dams names were?
HQsmRzPsaa	try playing with the toy too to get the bird interested in them. if s/he sees you like playing with them it might start too. try getting toys that you can put treats in. seeing peanuts might intrigue the bird into trying to get the treat out. also try putting a mirror behind the cage. my cockatoo loves looking at him self haha.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Toos are VERY neurotic birds!  You have to ignore the screaming, not giving her any attention when she does it.  Bad attention is still attention to her.<br>  <br>  They toys thing, our umbrella will NOT play with toys meant for his size!  He likes the smaller toys.  Never has like the hard wood blocks at all!  We get him the smaller toys meant for cockatiels.  He LOVES them!  He also like candy wrappers- foiled ones.  We make sure ALL the chocolate is off of them, and he plays with them- stuffing them into holes in beads, etc.  Try using a smaller toy to see if he'll like that.  He apparently has lots of issues with being abandoned- which is why he screams for you and probably why he started plucking.  Sure hope you can calm him down!  Ours is the best little guy int eh entire world, but the bird store he gets his wings/nails done at will not even touch another umbrella due to their behavior!  Ours goes rihgt to her, and she does not even have to wear gloves with him at all!  <br>  <br>  Also, try leaving on aradio for him when youa re not in the room.  Ours seems to like to hear the music playing- on radio, or even when he hears music on a commercial while with me.  <br>  <br>  Hope it works for all of you!  Do be careful the bad behavior does not rub off on the second one.  Hate to say it, but one good bird, and one that needs another home, would be better than two bad.|`|9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	Cockatoos are unfortunately prone to this behavior.  First of all, you can't encourage her screaming.  This is very, very, very, difficult to do with a cockatoo.  (I know how irritating a screaming cockatoo is!)  However, if every time she screams you reward her behavior by giving her attention, she will never stop.  <br>  <br>  Plucking can be a natural reaction to disease. My avian vet charges two hundred and fifty dollars for x-rays and tests. You can also check out www.avianbiotech.com for some cheaper tests.  I would recommend a vet check-up at least because you have another bird that could be at risk.  <br>  <br>  If an illness is not the problem, then you have some of the best solutions already to fix the issue.  You have her in a big cage, and she will evenually watch her new buddy and learn to play with her toys.  <br>  <br>  My cockatoo came from an abusive situation that left him very tramatized.  It took over a year before he would take a treat from my hands.  He didn't make hardly any noises.  It has taken a lot of time, but he now plays with his toys without looking guilty. <br>  <br>  Time, patience, and the ability to ignore the screaming, and she'll be a wonderful pet.|`|CEgq26oHaa	My cockatoo will scream when I leave a room too.  When I come back in the room she stops.  Cockatoos really require A LOT of attention and interaction.  It will take some time for your new one to get used to her new home and form a bond with you.  I've heard that when you are out of a room and they scream for you, it is their way of calling to their "flock leader".  I dont know if that is true or not, but don't just ignore her...go back and give her some attention.  She might require some extra time from you being this is a new home.  I have a play gym for mine and she loves it and it does keep her busy.  I've added some extra toys to it for her to play with.  <br>  <br>  As for the missing feathers, I'd be getting that checked out by a vet.  If it is some kind of disease it could easily spread to your other bird.  The only times I've ever known a bird to not have feathers, is either from some kind of disease or illness, or simply plucking from being neglected.
AA10986942	What kind of horse?  Is she registered? How old is she? How tall is she?  Has she ever been to a show? What part of the country/world do you live in?  You need to post a picture of her... There are a lot of questions you have to answer before anyone can give you any price and even then without seeing her in person the price will not be accurate.... Ask a horse person in your area that buys and sells horses to evaluate her..|`|0e51HkpHaa	less than $1000 in southeast Texas<br>  probably around $500 if she has papers|`|3YHZUuhyaa	it would be helpful if you had more info and pictures but I would say around $500.<br>  I got a dead broke arabian mare for free.|`|IsUEgEttaa	most that i've seen advertized run from 1.500 to 3,000 but it also depends on the breed|`|2nsNvIanaa	ask around 2 get an idea.|`|0ESxOfdmaa	Need more info, breed, age, height, etc.
3giaPYe8aa	Actually that weight seems pretty normal to me, but the weight itself has little to do with the over all health of the dog.|`|PM23RDycaa	It can be healthy. Min Pin standard only addresses the height of the animal not its weight. Average though is 8-11lbs pounds I believe as an adult.<br>  <br>  This is why you deal with a reputable breeder who does genetic clearances and so forth.|`|VBtAERBaaa	Im not sure but you can look up how much an adult is supposed to weigh and then compare that to the parents of the puppy. If they look normal and the puppy has no sickness then its probably fine.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	this is a question for a vet- even they can't tell if a dog is healthy without an exam|`|uhlPVTdkaa	i think that is very normal because they are known to be skinney it is healthy though
IRaIxWJKaa	Drool isn't from a cold, it's from something he had in his mouth that irritated the tissues, from something semi-toxic he may have eaten (any chemicals for insects around? Poisons?), from plants he could have chewed on that are toxic, OR from a broken tooth or infected root.<br>  <br>  I'd take him in for a checkup and tell the vet what's happened.  They need to see if he's getting dehydrated as well.  Have them check for infection, broken or cracked teeth, mouth ulcers, etc.|`|tL73W0VZaa	It's probably a reaction to some substance that your cat has come in contact with. It might be serious, and it might not be. If you are really scared, then you might want to take him to a vet right now, as tomorrow is Saturday. Most vet clinics are closed over the weekend, meaning you have to take your animal to an emergency clinic, which is much more expensive. <br>  <br>  If you would rather try to wait it out, then keep a very close eye on him, because if there is something seriously wrong, then it could go from bad to worse very fast, and new symptoms could develop very quickly. If it doesn't get better within about six hours, then I would take him to see someone.|`|4k7AHnvAaa	That sounds like some kind of allergic reaction. It's not serious or the cat would have had more than those symptoms. Don't be scared, but take the cat to the vet, get the cat checked over, and make sure that the chemicals in the house are changed, and the place is well ventilated.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	There is something in there a chemical he's having a reaction too, take him to the vet before it's to late and find out what the apartment owner cleaned the basement with.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Yes, it might be cold down there, have a fleece or other blanket on the sofa, bed or chair, to allow the cat to sleep on and get himself/herself warm thru the blanket.  Please do not expect the cat to sleep on the floor.  They need to be warm, like us.  If the cat eats, sleeps and poops, regularly you are probably ok.  How long have you been in the new basement apt?  We need to adjust an so do they need to adjust to new things.  Think now, is the food diff?, is the sleeping place diff, is the air quality diff?  Well those are things to consider.|`|vYeS5mYnaa	i think drooling is a symptom of feline leukemia. is your cat vomiting or sleeping ALOT? takehim to the vee ee tee!

She may be playing at night or while everyone is at school/work.  Is she eating and drinking?  Make sure to monitor the food and water, if she is not eating or drinking then contact your vet.  Also, if you pinch the back of the neck slightly and twist it the skin should go right back into place.  If it does not then she may be dehydrated and you will need to contact your vet. I hope she starts feeling better soon.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Kitties are so very sleepy always.  I have two just over 1yr old and they want to sleep most of the day, they sleep some at night but sounds like mostly they are running thru the hse.  They are nocturnal and they play at night and sleep most of the days.  My cats want to eat too much, every time that I go to the kitchen, cook something, well they are both near the feeding bowls.<br>  But yes, they do sleep lots especially as little kittens.  So, do not worrry, if they eat sleep and use the pot, they are all ok.<br>  Let them sleep.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	have you noticed any changes in her litter box or in her eating habits? cats sleep something like 12 to 18 hours a day, she could just be maturing.|`|JQZzI49Paa	It sounds like it.

For now, I would let it go, but if she continues to be inactive for another four or five days, then I would give the vet a call. In the mean time, keep an eye on her. If you notice her nose running, if she seems to be running a fever, you find blood in the litter box, or anything else seems off, then she is probably sick.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	There is nothing wrong with her.  Cats are nocturnal by nature, and typically sleep during the day.  Small kittens tend to sleep longer.  If she is active during the night and early morning/evening, she is fine.  Unless she is always sleeping for more than a week, take her to the veterinarian just to be sure.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	My kitten used to sleep for hours and hours somedays, but it is normal and nothing to worry about. Although if she is sleeping the whole day or longer, I would try to wake her up, play with her and get her active.<br>  Or if your really worried, take her to the vet, but there is no need at this point. She's probably just tired!|`|55MkioABaa	kittens need between 14 to 20 hours of sleep a day. They only have a few hours a day where they are awake and active.<br>  If she is still eating and drinking and going to the toilet there will be nothing wrong. <br>  <br>  Make sure your home is not too warm.

She is just catching up on her sleep after a few days of playing. Cats sleep, eat and play. They are lazy animals, i have 7 and they are all lazy and sleep for most of the day. Your kitten is perfectly normal.|`|MEVMf1bdaa	wait for another couple of days to see if your cat is still sleeping or if it was just sleeping because it was tired. if so then take it to the vet because you dont want to waste money on the vet when there is nothing wrong with your cat.|`|4k7AHnvAaa	Have you ever heard the joke: "Cats have 9 lives, but sleep through 8 and a half of them"? <br>  <br>  I'm sure you're cat is fine.

WHERE DID U GET A DRAGON.........WAIT UM.....|`|mFy3M8mVaa	I use regular old nail trimmers to trim my beardie's nails. If you examine your beardie's claws you will notice that they have a bit of a 'hook' at the end. I just trim off the hook. Cut the nails on a 45 degree angle. It is important to keep their nails at a reasonable length. If the nails are too long it will cause their digits to bend and make walking/climbing very uncomfortable for them.<br>  If you are unsure about this I would recommend visiting an experienced herp veterinarian who can demonstrate the proper way to cut the nails so you will feel confident doing it yourself.|`|lNzhglLFaa	If you dont feel comfortable doing it ask your pet store or vet if they will do it for you....<br>  <br>  if you feel up to it here ya go:<br>  <br>  get someone to hold him for you<br>  <br>  get blood stop (styptic powder) to stop bleeding if you hit the quick(the pink area of the nail)<br>  <br>  use finger nail trimmers. they are easier to handle and work well<br>  <br>  just take the tips...<br>  <br>  DONT  get in to the pink area (called the quick) that is a vein and he will bleed out....|`|aQCTR0Heaa	don't cut his nails. mine bearded dragon is the same age but female and she dosn't need her nails cutting. my brothers are adults and they nails are big but they have never been cut. they need them to climb.<br>  <br>  but if you have to cut them take the lizard to a shop if you can, if not don't cut past the white parts
jvURAYDxaa	This exactly happened to me recently with my 6 year old mixed breed dog. What I did was lead her into the park and keep her on the leash for a short time....your dog will be a bit overwhelmed at first, as everyone comes up to smell her, and might seem a bit frightened.This is normal. When she realizes that no one is going to hurt her, she will relax and join in the fun. If your dog is anything like mine was, she will make all the rounds of the doggy parents too!! Most people that go to a dog park are responsible pet owners.  Just keep an eye on her and Have fun!|`|fPLv0QrSaa	If your dog was well socialized with other dogs as a puppy then you should be okay. The dog park would be considered neutral territory for the dogs so they won't feel the need to protect it. My dog growls like crazy when another dog comes up to me while she is on a leash. When she is off leash, she is fine and plays with other dogs.|`|GaL66jbQaa	just because it's an off leash park doesn't mean you have to let her off right away.  Although some dogs are more aggressive on leash than off|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Well i personally wouldnt suggest the dog park, mainly because there are way too many overexcited, unbalanced dogs there, and thats what causes fights among other dogs. Your dog may not tolerate the younger more playful dogs, and may feel the need to dominate the other dogs. But if you insist on going there, the thing i would suggest is you drain her energy before bringing her to the dog park, like take her on a long run, so when she goes to the dog park, she already has released that pent up energy by then. And when there start off keeping her on a lead, and bring treats, for positive association training. When another dog comes around give her a treat, so she associates the other dogs as something positive.|`|6y8Of7fkaa	I think the first couple times you take her to the park keep her on one of those park leashes that extend far. This way she feels free yet you are in control in case something happens. I would do it very cautiously and slowly before letting her run completely loose. You want to protect her as well as the other owners dogs.|`|bdLJWKs9aa	Heres the greatest answer to fighting at the dog park. Bring a whistle. It will get any dog to stop long enough for you to grab them away from eachother and get the leash on. and most of the dog fights I have seen have just been barking no real all out hurting eachother although it does happen. The whistle is good.|`|IiH2zLlkaa	i think it would be good for your dog to go to a dog park because it lets it hear different sounds smell different smells and just have fun so i would recomend it if you really want to bring him|`|G4N7cSOYaa	I love taking my dogs to the bark park. I think she will be okay. Just watch her and stay close by. Only take her for short periods of time at first. If you think she is getting to agressive, just take her home and try again another day. <br>  <br>  Do NOT leave her on her leash when you take her in. You are just setting her up to get attacked and be defenseless. I have seen that happen to many times. You meet a lot of really great people at the park and if you talk to them, they will help you through the process too!<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know if you ever watch the dog whisper, but dogs feed off of you. So if you go in there acting nervous and thinking she is going to attack, she probably will. Make it a happy experience. <br>  <br>  From what you said, I really don't think you will have any problems! You can keep your leash with you and take her out on it, just don't bring her in on it.|`|oHKpy4IRaa	When you take her to the park you can keep her leash on for a little bit and let her and the dogs sniff eachother. When you see that she is not being aggressive you can take off the leash. Make sure you keep an eye on her. The minute you see her fighting wit a dog or growling at another dog take her away from the dogs and put her on the leash for a little bit. Then take her off the leash. If she does it again keep on doing that. I she dose not stop doing this take her out of the park. But, dogs are not as aggresive as they would be on the leash. Your dog probably starts fights with dogs that come into your house because she probably does not know the dog well and feels thretened around the dog. It is her house and she does not want other dogs in there with her.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!!<br>  I'll bet your dog is really cute (I wanna see a picture of her!)|`|3BMBZtDxaa	First try getting some of her doggy friends to go to a local park and have them play there for awhile. That way you can see how she reacts in a park setting with dogs she knows and owners that will be forgiving if she acts up.<br>  <br>  If she passes that test, then go to the dog park. Just keep her on the leash and let her sniff at the other dogs and walk her around. Watch her body signals. If she is showing any signs of being nervous or aggressive, then don't try taking her off leash.During this visit don't let her off leash, just let her sniff around and try and keep her under control as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Then, the next time you bring her, keep her on the leash for 15 minutes or so and make sure she's calm, then let her off but keep a close eye on her and see what she does. If she starts acting up, leave. If she's okay, let her play.<br>  <br>  Just start off slowly and don't do anything that you're not comfortable with! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mfXDUkRYaa	No, don't let her off the lead if you think there'll be a problem. Get an extending lead so you can control the distance she can go away from you.<br>  <br>  She probably just wants to play, but a lot of other dogs won't want to and could have a go at her, so you need to introduce the experiences to her carefully.<br>  <br>  I would see how she goes on a lead, practice recalling her so you know she will come back on command, and introduce her to other dogs on the lead. If there is a problem, you can just walk her on. If the other dog wants to play and the owner is OK with it then you can let her off but only if you're sure you can still be in control of her.
w4X6Y7tIaa	I have a four year old Rottie.The best thing about them is that they can be both.They are loyal,loving,companions.They can be friendly and outgoing (even with strangers).And they can also be scary,vicious looking guard dogs that will protect their family and home to no end.The key to making them both at the same time is a TON of training,constant supervision and lots of loving attention.They are the type of dogs that get angry or restless if they are left alone all day or even slightly mistreated.I would only recommend one to families with a lot of free time and patience.Preferably in a household where someone is always home.|`|PM23RDycaa	To be a good guard dog take PROPER training from a professional. Size has nothing to do with it. Secondly the animal should be properly contained to your yard or home at ALL time. Having animal trained as such makes you liable for any harm he does if he is not under your control at all times.<br>  <br>  Honestly you are better of getting a good home security system, insisting everyone in the family take self defense courses.<br>  <br>  Secondly only people who don't know better are intimidated at the sight of a rottie or any other large "aggressive breed"<br>  <br>  Also your friend has created a HUGE problem by having an animal that only listens to him when there are other people in the family. If something goes wrong and he is not around it can end VERY badly.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	I would recommend the chow-chow they are big and if you get a wrinkly one they can be pretty scary lol but anyway they are very lovable bit can be a bit aggressive if agitated so if you have some annoying lil babies in your family who will harass it DO NOT GET IT! but other then that they are lazy gentle loving things :)|`|GaL66jbQaa	It is mostly a matter of breeding and training.  Go to a reputable breeder that only breeds dogs with full health testing and that have a conformation or working title.  They should be family raised rather than kennel and hopefully already started on socialization and potty training.  I also like English Mastiffs if you want a dog that is intimidating and protective but not aggressive.  Find some good obedience classes as large breed pups grow very fast and you need to be in control from the start I really don't suggest ever beating your dog it can cause problems that may take a while to surface. He might be fine but why risk it with a dog that is going to be 130lbs or more. I bet your national kennel club has a link to local training clubs.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	How very sad that your friend chooses to treat his Rottweiler so poorly.  Be careful getting one for free, no really a wise choice, unless you are really good friends with the breeder, and the breeder is breeding quality dogs.  You need something that has a good temperament, not something that is unstable.  I suggest finding a Rottweiler puppy whose sire and dam where temperament tested, or passed the breed stability test.  Also, health is an issue in the breed, so you want to be sure the parents were tested for hips, elbow, heart and eyes.  <br>  You friend's dog is cowering from your friend, it was beaten into him to be that way.  A dog should never lower its head to the alpha, it shouldn't have to.  There is no need to beat a dog to get it to understand who the leader of the pack it.  Honestly, at 8 months old, I would guess it was just going through puberty, and was simply challenging its master to see if the master was the alpha it needed.  That could have been accomplished in other ways than beating it.  Rottweilers need a strong hand, but not an abusive one.  They need to be owned and loved by someone who has a take charge attitude, or they will take charge.  They need constant training, so that they are reminded of their place, and all, but again, they do not need beatings.  <br>  <br>  My Rottweilers love me to death.  And they know me as alpha, though I have never raised a hand to them.  They know what I say goes, period.  As for guarding you.  I often joke with my friends that if someone broke into my home, Kaylee, the older one, would be sitting in her crate, wiggling from end to end, begging to be petted.  Whereas Brit, would take on look at the person, and give a don't you dare, attitude.  But, honestly, I think if someone where intent on hurting me, they would both give the person what for.  Again, my opinion, they can make great pets, but they need great socialization to keep them people friendly.   A Rottweiler will be quick to "tell you off" if you are doing something they don't like, does that mean they will bite, no, most likely they will bark much.  My one girl does not like being stared down, but what dog does.  When that happens, I feel the growl start in her leash and work its way up.  My job as owner is to make that person stop staring at my dog.  Make it clear it  is wrong, and inappropriate.  Leave me dog alone, leave me alone.  If they choose to persist, we walk away.  Unfortunately Rottweilers have gotten a bad rep because of people like you friend, and other irresponsible owners.  It is my job as owner of my dogs to protect them, to protect the breed, not allow them to run amuck.    A properly raised and trained Rottweiler is a pleasure to own.  And, just having one walking by your side should be enough to deter would be muggers. But, there are other large intimidating looking breeds to.  So maybe one of them would be just as good a choice or better.|`|yiOSJUsjaa	My experience with rottweilers are that they can be very loyal, loving family pets. BUT, that doesn't change the fact that they can be extremely possessive and, like most dogs can, turn their back on you at any second. If you are looking for a more child-friendly dog...go with the shepherd, they are wonderful companions and pets, and of course they are excellent guard dogs. The reason why i would choose the german shepherd is mainly because my cousin had one who was a great dog for many years, and one day when he was coming out of the vet, a woman asked to pet him...and he bit her had so bad that she was rushed to the ER and was severely injured. And we were all shocked because Gordo (the rottweiler) was such a sweet boy.<br>  hope you find an awesome dog either way!|`|7RO4Pxeaaa	ive had a rottweiler for years and the worst thing its done to me is playfully hit me with her paw when i wouldnt rub her belly, and it didnt really hurt anyone unless they started chasing me or my brother|`|vuh0i3Axaa	German Shepherds are the best breed out there....<br>  <br>  not only are they amazing guard dogs...<br>  <br>  but an overall amazing dog...|`|qVZoOUtraa	i like pitts (pittbulls) i hade one a few years back and she was the sweetest dog ever (only got rid of her because moved to an apt with a weight limit of 15lbs)|`|5N2lcQtjaa	Bad choice to get a rottweiler,  not one of the nicest dogs.  I have a german Shepperd named herman.  what is special about him is that he answers to orders only in german.  But he is a loyal guard and a pet.  So best to get a german Shepperd than a Rottweiler.  if it bites you it won't let go.  Or if it gets into a fight with another dog it will kill it and then your dog will be euthanized.  So go german Shepperd|`|OrvTG44laa	They are both good guard dogs and family pets.<br>  Rottweilers have a natural instinct to protect.  They have a great bite force and will definitely scare off any intruders.  They are loyal and will protect you.  However, they have to be trained very well, so they don't attack the mailman or someone that's not a threat.  So while they may be able to protect you, you need to train them so they only protect you when there is actual danger.<br>  German Shepherds are also intimidating.  Even though they're smaller and less aggressive looking than rottweilers, muggers will stay away from you.  They can also be trained to attack on command.  Remember, they are widely used as police dogs to take down criminals.  These dogs are going to do the job.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRaCv4Njcnk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRaCv4Njc...</a> <br>  The link above is a video of a trained German Shepherd.  See for yourself.  <br>  If it were me, I'd get both.  But for you, either one will be good.  Both require a firm handler, but the German Shepherd will be easier to train.|`|eV6MHADQaa	any breed you choose can be trained to that level some mutts and street dogs are smarter than ped. dogs because of survival on the street if you want a dog that is intimidating get a mastiff they are so big people dont even take a chance if there friendly they move out the way|`|hHAdA9V9aa	The dog can be anything you want it to be. It's mind is easily manipulated. The dog is the product of an owner. Good owner = good dog and vice versa.<br>  <br>  I think you should never train dogs as guard dogs. We don't train people as guard people. Brainwashing is aweful; animal or human.|`|loqsl5xXaa	I have a mix (90% chow and 10 german shep.).. She is very protective of us woman in the family!! If we are walking esp. at nite with her and someone else is walking towards us she will change sides ans push us over so she is between that person and me or my mom. when a stranger comes in the house and they are standing near us she stands between. If someone is walking down the street or pass the place she watches if they stop or look like they could be trouble she will bark and growl and she go nuts.. She can smell pot and stuff a mile away and she wont let that person near her or her family. <br>  <br>  My nephew when he was smaller she wouldn't let him go near the road or to close to the fence. She didn't like him outside by himself (we had a fenced yard with a lock) we lived in a decent area too). she is great with little kids although she can play a little rough. She was also the runt of the litter. <br>  <br>  she is my baby and i wouldn't exchange her for the biggest, meanest best guard dog ever! To me she is very smart and protective! <br>  <br>  i think if you get the rottweiler..the temper of the pooch may be unpredictable at times. i think if you train him/her and make sure she is around your family/friends and let some people pet him/her at times while your out and all that to have fun. Make sure he/she knows the difference between a suspect and someone who is trying to be nice. Make sure that what ever word u use to get the dogs attention for a questionable person who may harm you that he/she knows when to protect and when to just watch. If that made sense, lol.. All dogs to me have their own issues...I think it is how you you treat them and train them.. if they are a great dog or a mean unpredictable pooch. <br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you find a dog you can love and who will protect you and your family|`|uHwIz8U3aa	I've got a rottweiler and he is so....awesome! He is a strait up mommas boy! He has big head and is pretty big for his bread he makes other rotties look small! His name is Merlin had him sence he was about 6 months old he is just gorgeous. Anyways I do know that you and your family have to remain alfa of the dog. I am not a trainer. It did take alote of consistency in training him to have respect and know his boundaries. Yes, you have too stay on top of him/her always. They do at times like to challenge and you need to meet that challenge every-time or else you will lose control. My husband works alote so I am the one who has to maintain the discipline. So my dog respects me and views me as alfa. Anyways he tried to challenge my husband once (because hes not around as much) while they were playing and it got rough until my husband layed him out and held him to the floor until he submitted. Now he knows better than to do that again. Still every now and then he'll still try to buck at us, but again we meet him every time and he always backs down. Hes going on three years old now and his challenging seems to be alote less. As far as a guard dog, my (beagle-weiler) we call him that because when he barks he sounds like a beagle!!!! LOL! he is great, If you train them right and have that control they wont just go out and attack anyone unless its to protect you (they are great gladiator dogs). I would tend to trust their senses when it comes to judging character to. I know of a women who will not rent out her homes unless her dog likes the people. He been a great judge so far! My husband has always had a rottie sence he was a boy. His first one was a retired female police dog and I had the privilege of knowing her for a year before she died. All I can say is we will always have one. I'm not saying shepards arent great because they are, but a rottie is just AWESOME!  Sorry about the grammar.
enC9TvxUaa	-I would stick with one!!!  The whole potty training, and training in general, is hard enough for one, triple it with two!!  The breeder may tell you otherwise, but does he really think so, or just want double the sale?<br>  <br>  After a few weeks at most, they will be able to hold it until morning.  (Assuming you are not getting a 4 week old puppy- right?)|`|3giaPYe8aa	No!  Get one and train it first before getting a second one.  Two pups will bond/play with each other making it almost impossible to establish leadership and make training very difficult.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	two puppies are not twice the work, they are 10 times the work as they are both untrained and will instigate each other into unwanted behavior.  <br>  <br>  If you want 2 dogs to keep each other company, I would go with a well trained adult dog and a puppy.  That way the puppy will copy the well trained dog and training will be easier for you.|`|kdMM7OAaaa	it doesnt matter how many you get. i got two when they were 4 months and they grew up fine. dont listen to the potty training problems, as long as you take them outside when they look like they have to go. my friend had this issue not real long ago.<br>  1, for a month at least, use puppy mats you can get at petco.<br>  <br>  2. get an invisible fence.\<br>  <br>  3. when the pups do good on the mats, teach them to go outside. eventually u will just have to slip the collar on, then let them outside to go.<br>  <br>  well after a few weeks a pup comes to your home, it will probably stop. just remind you, it needs time to get used to their new home. and it will miss its moms if there very young. they need time, it doesnt happen immediatley. hope i helped!|`|6RqjxUTnaa	well i think you should go with two because just like people Dogs need friends and Playmates. So i would get 2 it is alot of work but It will help the puppies learn quicker ,and also will help them settle in better. To me it is better to get 2 than one if you can handle it.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I think it is as easy to train 2 at a time than just one. Other people say no, one at a time. If you raise 2 they will be more bonded with each other than to you. They will both need to be fixed. It is usually best to have a male/female pair than a male/male or a female/female.|`|S5Lz35myaa	As for 2 versus 1, there are pros and cons to both:<br>  Pros - they will keep each other company, they will both have a lifelong playmate, they will learn the good behaviors from each other<br>  Cons - the cost is twice as much for food, vets, etc., they will learn the bad behaviors from each other, it can take its toll on you physically to keep up with 2 dogs training at the same time.<br>  Personally, I have always had multiple dogs in the house, and it was great.  If you can physically keep up with them and financially afford them, then I'd say "go for it".<br>  As for the second question, unfortunately, it's been too long since I've had puppies trying to housebreak, so I'll let someone else answer this one.|`|6y8Of7fkaa	The age thing depends on how well they are trained and retain the training. It will be very very hard to get both dogs at the same time and to be puppies. You will need a lot a lot of time to devote to them. You may want to think about waiting a yr for the second one this way you won't be pulling your hair out. The other dog will still be young enough to want to play a lot too. So I personally would wait at least one yr before getting the 2nd one.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	I have three dogs but we staggered the time we got them (hell we only intended to have one but they do like each others company).<br>  <br>  Even now, as an experienced owner I wouldn't take two at a time. They aren't like Guinea Pigs or Fish, they also thrive on human companionship and the dog will begin to see you as his or her new pack straight away.<br>  <br>  Training one dog to behave is hard enough; they're just like children. They need alot of care and attention.|`|Cx0IAMGVaa	Having one puppy is already a lot of work. Having another one is twice the work. Remember, a puppy is like having a child. They need constant supervision and lots of care. So, if you can handle two crazy adorable pups, go ahead. In the long run, they can keep each other company when you have to leave them. If you get them at really early at 2-3months, they can't control their bladders so expect them to pee/poop in the house for a few days until they get used to living in your house. Make sure you clean the stains well and start the housebreaking process now! A few pointers to remember though:<br>  <br>  *Crate train them. This is the most useful device for the perfect housebroken dog. And put them on a schedule. Take them out every 2 hours for 2month old puppy, 3 hours for 4month old. 4-5 hours for 5 month. Very soon they will be able to hold it for 6-7 hours. Don't let them hold it more than 8 hours tho. Imagine not having to pee for 8 hours. <br>  <br>  *At 2-3 months, they need to be crated, at the same time make sure you have them by your side. Sometimes they need to be taken out at night. <br>  <br>  *My Corgi could sleep the whole night without having to go at 4 months old, but she was inside the crate, with the crate door locked. This will train them to hold their pee and not soil their crate. One time I left the crate door unlocked and the next morning, she peed on the carpet.  But at 6 months old, she was able to hold it the entire night, with the crate door wide open, she didn't even pee on the carpet!! She waited for us to let her go outside at 7.30am everyday till this day.|`|ZSXstSXBaa	I started with one dog (an american pit bull terrier-Gypsi-female-13wks 2days) then got another 1 1/2 years later (a mini dachshund-Duchess-female-6wks1day) and they love each other. (I know funny combination, but they're my 2 favorite breeds!!) At 1st, Gypsi was not happy to have another little dog in the house. She drooled all over Duchess, would move her around with her nose and paws, would whine if I was holding her. But then after about 2 weeks she realized Duchess was part of the family and she started being very motherly and even had a false pregnancy (she started producing milk and her breast tissue got infected so we had to take her to the vet ). Now, they love each other, follow each other around, sleep on top of each other, and it's so cute!! They are inseparable!! I think multiple dogs are the way to go. They have someone to play with when you're away, they're not alone, they are more sociable to other dogs. About the age when they sleep through the night. I think that all depends on the breed, how much time you take to train, and other variables. Duchess still whines to go out in the middle of the night and she's 13 weeks. My boyfriend and I have different sleep schedules so he's up till 4-5 a.m and can let her out after I do at about 10 p.m then I wake up at about 9-10 a.m and let them both out again. However, if you don't have the time, patience, or funds to care for multiple dogs; then I wouldn't get more than one just so they have a playmate. It's not fair to the dogs.|`|G4N7cSOYaa	I think it depends. I have 2 dogs right now. We were just going to have 1 but she was WAY to hyper and needed a friend. It was the best decision I ever made. They are less destrictive.<br>  <br>  It also depends on the breed and if you are home a lot. If you get a dog like a husky (which I have) they are pack dogs and don't like to be alone. So read up on the dog breeds and see what it says about it.|`|oooWpy6Qaa	One puppy at a time. Let him grow up, train him, housetrain and crate train, socialize and everything else.. Then add a 2nd dog.|`|uAzToWC7aa	if uve had dogs before it would be okay to hav two, but if uve never had any dogs b4, u shouldstick with one.|`|BvJKu7cGaa	i have three dogs and when we got our second one my girl was a year old and we brought a boy puppy into the house and at first she hated him and tried to bite him, but we took it slow and was patient about it, and it took a couple months for them to get along real well, now they are inseparable and our newest dog is fitting in pretty good, give it a few months. but if you bring them in the house together they probably wont have much trouble getting along. i think they like to have the the company more than being the only dog. <br>  <br>  as far as sleeping through the night without having an accident, it took a good month or two to potty train our dogs, you have to be patient and until they learn to hold it you could put them in a crate overnight because most dogs wont use the bathroom in the place they sleep in. and it will help to get them used to the crate at an early age because you shouldnt leave multiple dogs alone if you aren't there because they could aggervate eachother and it could turn into a fight. good luck with your dogs and remember give them lots of love!!

bdc0b0f0724a4bf1ba102444af8d0705aa	Contrary to popular belief, a calico cat is not a specific breed of cat. It is instead an unusual pattern of coloring that can occur in many different breeds, including Manx, Persian, and Domestic Short-Hair cats. To be considered a calico cat, a cat must be tri-colored, with patches of white, red or orange, and black fur. Some breeds have rules as to what percentage of the cat's fur must be white for it to be called a calico cat.<br>  <br>  Calico cats are nearly always female. This is due to the genes for the orange or black color being on the X chromosome. Female cats have two X chromosomes, while male cats have an X and a Y chromosome. Therefore, the mother cat passes the X chromosome on to her kittens, while the father passes either the X or Y chromosome, thus determining the kittens’ sex. To be a calico cat, the kitten must have an X chromosome that has the orange color and an X chromosome that has the black color. Male calico cats are genetic anomalies, with XXY chromosomes and are sterile and extremely rare. <br>  <br>  A calico cat has sections of different colors in its fur. Usually the calicos with more white fur also have larger and more distinct patches of color. If the orange and black fur is mixed, the cat is called a tortoiseshell. Tortoiseshell cats, or "torties," as they are commonly known, have little or no white fur. <br>  <br>  A variation on the usual calico color pattern is the "dilute" or "pastel" calico cat. This type of calico cat gets its name from the fact that its color pattern is a "diluted" or "pastel" version of the typical colors. A dilute or pastel calico cat has a pattern of buff or cream instead of orange and "blue", a slate gray color, instead of black.<br>  <br>  Throughout history, many cultures have considered the calico cat to be lucky. At one point in Japan, a calico cat was thought to bring good luck in the house and to protect sailors on their ships. The calico cat was adopted as the Maryland state cat on 1 October 2001 because its colors of black, white, and orange are the same as the Baltimore Oriole and the Baltimore Checkerspot butterfly; the state bird and insect, respectively.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Calico is a coloration that includes patches on orange & black (or gray, if the calico is dilute) on a white cat.<br>  <br>  Almost always female in gender.|`|A2XoAT3Xaa	About Calico Cat can be read in <a href="http://news-blog-yahoo.blogspot.com/?q=Calico%20Cat" rel="nofollow">http://news-blog-yahoo.blogspot.com/?q=C...</a>|`|SOxdyWQOaa	there always female and very sweet|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Calico - basically a white cat with patches of Red (orange) and Black.<br>  Tortoiseshell - Black and Red colors mixed together<br>  Tortie & White - Tortoiseshell with white on the face, chest, feet, belly<br>  <br>  Torbie or Patched Tabby - A brown, blue, silver tabby that has patches of Red Tabby mixed in the coat.
5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	get a live trap and get her and have her spayed.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  Cat's pregnancy is is 52 to 70 days.  I advise to get the following ready...<br>  <br>  1.  A nice warm box where you can put towels for them to lay and a towel to give her and her babies some privacy.<br>  2.  A nice quiet and safe play, as they become protective to their babies. <br>  4. Make sure their food, water and litter are close by.  <br>  The best place for this, is your have a walk in closet, or a nice and quiet dark room. Cat tend to follow a quiet, warm room to hide. <br>  <br>  When the kittens are born, she will take care on cleaning them, just make sure to have a 24 hours vet telephone on hand if needed.  Once they are born, give them space at least when they babies are moving around, which is about 2 weeks.  Pet your mommy cat first, before the babies, so the mommy smell is in your hands.  Once they open your eyes, you can get them check out by the vet.  About 2 months old, is the best time to have them all fixed.  A cat that are fixed, live longer, have a lower temperament. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and enjoy motherhood.|`|An2AopAqaa	This is a good thing because some cats hide away and have their kittens in random places like under cupboards and down holes so you can't get to them and check them. <br>  <br>  Set up a corner with a bed and such. A large crisp box with blankets will work very well. Put her litter tray and food bowls near it so she gets used to spending time near it. Because she's wanting to be close to you I'd put it in the room you spend the most time in. <br>  <br>  Good luck with the mummy and babies ^-^|`|evnj2DUpaa	The gestation period for cats is 2 months. If she is close to that, then she will give birth soon! From the signs you describe, she seems pretty close. Stay by her side and call your vet if you are concerned. Best of luck.

200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	Ditto on the pillowcase. I always carry my snakes in pillowcases. They allow for ventilation, shade, and are easy to check to make sure the snake is alright (since you can see them moving a lot easier and such).<br>  <br>  I usually tie it off with a hair tie and then knot it (loose enough to undo, tight enough to keep the snake from escaping).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	it should be fine|`|TkJn9gO0aa	Did you also check the laws for venomous rear-fanged snakes? I'm not belittling you, but usually when people buy vine snakes they don't realize that they are considered venomous. Double check on that.<br>  <br>  It should be fine in the tupperware for that amount of time as long as there is plenty of ventilation. But I would rather put it in a large pillowcase ties at one end. It will stress the snake out less and insure ventilation at the same time..........just make sure it is kept at or above room temperature at all times.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I did read your entire post...hence my use of the word "also"......you never specified that that you checked the laws pertaining to both "typical rear fanged" snakes and "venomous" snakes...... there is a difference. I was merely trying to be helpful in case you overlooked something. They are always mentioned separately in at least 2 places, but usually more. <br>  <br>  You can never be to careful, especially when Wildlife and Resource Agencies are involved.|`|7ZjloThDaa	It should be fine in that container for the night.

339NqJ84aa	A pregnant ferret is not easy to take care of and a jill not bred will die. PLEASE spay her!<br>  <br>  APLASTIC ANEMIA This is a common cause of death of unspayed, non-breeding females. This condition occurs when high levels of estrogen are produced during the "heat" cycle and suppress the production of red and white blood cells in the bone marrow. Advanced cases are irreversible and death occurs from the severe anemia and secondary bacterial infections that set in

gz5O9Tbpaa	My husband is in the army and we move a lot so I'm always looking for a new vet and groomer for my yorkie. When I move to a new town, I always to talk to the local pet store owners. They usually know which vets are great and which ones arent. Same with groomers. None of them have ever given me bad recommendations. <br>  <br>  Also, many vets have groomers on staff. So if you like your vet, try their groomer out too. And dont worry, the hair always grows back.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Ask people you know who have their dogs groomed on a regular basis where they go and why.  You want someone who is patient with puppies; it usually takes a couple of visits to teach them to have good grooming manners.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Ask vet, pet stores or ppl whose dog you like the way they look.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use big box grooming places. Use only actual grooming salons where grooming is their primary business & you will get much better care taken of your dog than by someone not trained correctly & trying to make their numbers for the week.|`|AA11244754	do some research on groomers in your area.  I thought before I moved to Dallas I had found a new groomer but upon doing research and looking at the customer reviews they had a lot of negative reviews so please research online, ask your friends that had dogs that need grooming to find some a groomer that is reasonably priced and treats your baby well.|`|AA11946005	Call the animal hospital/vet that you use- they can likely recommend one, or may even have one who does grooming at their site once a week or on a set schedule.|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	picking a groomer is like picking a hairdresser ask around and talk to other customers observe dogs exiting a shop see if you like the job they do|`|l0qZNFQkaa	Be careful who  you leave your puppy with ! i have worked in shops where They puppies where not handled right and this lead to grown dog that hated being groomed.<br>  <br>   it should only take an hour or so to do your pup so  see if they will let you drop off and pick up so the puppy dont have to sit in a cage and wait . these only make them nervouse.<br>   <br>  ask if you can wait... not a great idea but some groomers will let you.<br>  My first grooms on a puppy are  start with a bath and i just turn on the trimmer if they deal with the noise I will trim under they're feet and tummy  I might trim a little a round the eyes. and the blow dryer most dog don't care so the puppies normally do very well and some even like the blowers.<br>  <br>   I don't recommend a groomer who will just toss your dog on the table and tie it down do the groom and toss it back in to a cage I know groomers are busy , that is why I sit time for the puppies first and second grooms  Yes this cost the owner a little more money but they know the puppy is in good hands and will not be scared to come back.|`|okAYAGvXaa	It depends if you live in Calcutta, India or Brownsville, Indiana.<br>  Late entry : but I guess both places are full of azzholes ready to thumb down inconvenient answers :))))
Mcf33eLbaa	No he`s not too young to start learning, in fact I start with my guy`s at 8 weeks with teaching such things as sit, down, stand and the start of stay`s. <br>  In your situation seeing that your dog is not food motivated you need to find the motivator he loves like a ball, toy, whatever, have you tried cheese? they sell string cheese in small packages.<br>  Whatever it is you need to stay with a routine and not get frustrated by his actions on leash.<br>  I would say that every time he forges ahead Do an about turn in the opposite direction or a left turn.<br>  With left turn just as he starts to forge grab hold of the leash stopping his forward momentum and make an extreme left as if you were cutting off a car.<br>  With about turns don`t wait for the leash to get tight but as it starts and he is not watching you do a quick about turn and let the leash get tight because of heading in the opposite direction. Just don`t drag the dog give a small pop on the leash if neccessary.<br>  During any attempt try to keep his motivator at your side but slightly in front of him and reward and praise frequently for doing a good job.<br>  I`m sitting here typing these but heck you may not know a proper Left, Right or About Turn.<br>  Find an obedience school/club in your area that trains at a competition level and learn to do these steps.<br>  As it is with my students I tell them to practice the foot work first without their dogs then attempt it. <br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|24CFl7sjaa	3 months is very young to expect perfect obedience or even full attention for any great length of time, there is a whole new world out there waiting to be sniffed over!<br>  Keep your training short and sweet, find something he loves to keep his attention on you, might be a favourite toy or something you can shake to get his attention. Practise in your yard to give him a fighting chance of getting it right without the added distractions of the outside world. Little and often and lots of fun and rewards and you will have a lovely dog in a few months time.|`|8H2MEkq2aa	It is a little young but its good practice.<br>  Most breeds are very trainable around 6 months old but keep trying.<br>  Keep him on a shorter leash so he wont circle around your legs.<br>  You don't want him getting bad habits this early on.<br>  Walking is good for a growing dog. This shouldn't hurt him in any way.<br>  If he doesn't like treats then that's good. Praise is better than treats.<br>  I have never used treat training  except for tricks.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	Maybe he just doesn't like the treats you have? My dogs love Puperoni, lol. And I believe that he's a bit too young. So his attention span isn't that long and it will take a while to teach it. Plus the distractions do not help, practice inside your home first.|`|Vk6s6VTAaa	No he is not too young. You can do it!<br>  <br>  It will just take a while.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Patience. NO 3month old pup will "heel" properly. This is a tough one even for a well trained mature dog.

It's also good exercise. <br>  <br>  Make sure you use saw dust for the floor laying. Don't use anything too fine, as it can get in their eyes, and can cause them to go blind. Also, don't use hay on the floor. For smaller hamsters, it can get stuck round their foot.. causing the foot to have no circulation (resulting in your hamster dieing). It can also get stuck in their pouch. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|4ew4ogH8aa	you should give it a bed of hay or soft tan grass so it can burrow a little to sleep<br>  they really like that. <br>  other than food, water, grass and something to play with, he's set ^^|`|S5utPIrgaa	That is all you need!|`|yUbS5Ou0aa	Be sure to have something wooden for it to chew on so that its teeth are kept down other than that it sounds good!
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	I couldn't find anything conclusive about whether they are legal or not, or if you are allowed to import them into the country.<br>  <br>  The best bet is to call an official in the two countries, and find out directly what their laws are.<br>  <br>  However, it is possible to find an airline that will allow the ferrets under your seat.  If you have two, you'll need two seats (you and your bf).  They may charge you a fee, but it will be better than sticking them in the hold.  At least the temperature will be better regulated in the cabin and your ferts will be able to smell your scents and know that you are with them :)  Just don't give up if the first few airlines don't, you will find one who will.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Will you be in air conditioned accomodation during your whole stay? Otherwise your ferrets will get dangerously overheated and possibly die. I couldnt say about the laws. Here is a list of pet shops in Dubai, I'm sure if you email a few and ask about the laws, you will get a picture of whether they are legal...dont rely on one store, they might not have the correct knowledge:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petdubai.com/petshops.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petdubai.com/petshops.htm</a><br>  <br>  Wiki also lists some countries where ferrets are illegal:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret#Regulation_on_ferrets_as_pets" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret#Regu...</a><br>  <br>  And Dubai and Saudi Arabia are not there but I wouldnt take this as writ. Remember it will also be a big problem finding an airline that will fly your ferrets, also they will need to go in the cargo hold. All in all it might be better for your ferrets to find them a new home.|`|qBV4OX6faa	If the laws in the country say no then u cant. Iam so sorry. :-(<br>  I had 2 cats in New York and we had to let them go they were very very a million times close to me!

p4kex5J7aa	Heya<br>  <br>  Im not really into iguanas but i can tell you that you need a heat lamp and an UVB lamp.

Without the proper lighting your will become sick and die a very painful death. Proper lighting can be provided utilizing fluorescent tubes specially made for use by reptiles as well as mercury vapor bulbs that also provide some heat as well. <br>  <br>  Additional heat can be provided utilizing infrared ceramic emitters and incandescent basking bulbs. Hot rocks should never be used under any circumstance as they can severely burn your iguana.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	Not sure about the skin, it might be dry skin or left over skin from shedding which didn't come off.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting reptile feeding powder; I remember shaking up crickets in a bag with the supplement powder which helped the geckos with their health and such.
fqlZNKTUaa	NO! Not a pomeranian they are very stressful for first-time dog owners. They are affectionate towards their owners but don't easily warm up to others, they are loud, aggressive, and obnoxious as well.

Puggles are cute too and there are not so many of them.|`|24CFl7sjaa	All these are small and affectionate towards their owners, I guess it depends on the degree of affection you want. Yorkshires tend to be the most self contained and less clingy of the 3, maltese are very bold for a tiny dog and along with Poms can become owner obsessed. Really does depend on what you want from your dog apart from small and loving.<br>  Have you thought about your lifestyle: time you have to exercise and train your dog, your own personal living arrangements, access to yard etc might help you make up your mind.|`|icPHWiz2aa	you should definitely get a Pomeranian there the sweetes most loving dogs i use to like bigger dogs then about five years ago my husband and i rescued to poms that were on there way to a puppy mill well that was that i fell in love with the breed i now have six healthy happy wonderful dogs they sleep with us eat with us and own our heart i just know you will love them the only thing that is hard about there care is they must be groomed often i brush mine three times a week and you have to decide between the toy breeds and there bigger versions mine are toys witch stay very small and can be hurt if not careful but as long as there healthy happy and fed well there the best dogs|`|v2ynaGgtaa	Yorkshires are the best the are very easily trained and they are very intelligent heres a pic of one: <br>  <br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.pups4sale.com.au/yorkshire_terrier_pups_03a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pups4sale.com.au/yorkshire_te...</a>|`|MpNCNQU5aa	get a pomeranians<br>  they are so cute and everyone loves them and they love you back|`|FQmZLqMdaa	The best thing you can do is go to your local Shelter & see if they have anything you fancy.

The dog will appreciate it's new home & with lots of love & attention will be an excellent friend & good guard dog.
RwQmN7Reaa	I have had this problem before and what I did was took a large jar, about the size of a pickle jar, I put some peanut butter in the very bottom of the jar, then I set the jar on its side in the last area i saw the mouse in. Another good idea is to take a bucket or jar and stand it up on the floor, also with peanut butter inside. Then make a ramp with wood or cardboard and the mouse will smell the peanut butter and run up to get it and fall into the trap. Peanut butter works much better than cheese because it gives off a much stronger odor, and it won't stink because cheese needs to be kept refrigerated.|`|UvhfYAHuaa	I agree with fishy. Get a plastic bucket that you would use to wash windows or walls with (you can get one at Walmart or the dollar store for next to nothing) defiantly use peanut butter, baring no one in your house is allergic to it. Set up books and/or cardboard to make a ramp making sure its tall enough so bucket stands upright and the mouse can't get out get out. Other wise if you go with something that sits on its side you have to hope you can get the container up right before the mouse can run out. This way just about can't fail. Just make sure you have any and all food sources put up in areas that the mouse can't get to. Good Luck|`|BpKECFBSaa	Get a box and put some cheese in it. Put it in a bathroom, or someplace where he cant get out of, but is small, then you have to wait and watch when he goes in. So preferably make the place by a couch or near something to sit on. Soon enough he will go in and you can just tip the box over and you have your mouse!|`|yzoTvZxNaa	There is a mouse trap that you can get and it traps them but it does not kill them then you can get it out here is a website that may help you :)<br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_catch_wild_mice_alive" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_do_catch_w...</a><br>  x Hope I helped x <br>  Good luck mouse catching ( alive )<br>  lol|`|KOtMicRKaa	i personaly dont think that the box thing would work there smart little animals i would try a different humain trap or just wait till he scurrys across the floor and catch him with a net or something as a more creative idea. :]

HZvdr8VLaa	Here's the basics:<br>  They need a place to be locked up at night that will also have a quiet secluded place for them to lay eggs in the daytime. If they are running around free during the day, this "coop" can be relatively small, just 4-6 square feet per bird. Outside, you will want to have a fence around where you want them to go unless your neighbors don't mind them. They are kind of destructive (digging in the dirt and eating plants you don't want them to). They need a constant supply of water. They also need chicken feed. Depending on how much area they have to roam in, during the summer they don't eat a lot of feed, they are pretty busy foraging. During the winter, they eat quite a bit more feed. I also buy scratch grains for mine and give them a lot of "treats" such as bread, fruit, leftovers from meals, etc. Hens will lay about an egg a day so you can judge how many hens you'd like to have to supply the eggs you want. Chickens are really extremely easy to care for once you are set up for them.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	I don't keep them as pet pets like in the house or anything but I have a BIG barn with sheep, horses, donkeys, ducks, geese, dogs, cats, goats, rabbits, AND chickens in it.<br>  And they poop A LOT and by a lot I mean it like its A LOT..

cnZlMojUaa	You must weigh the risks against the benefits. What will happen if the mass isn't removed? I don't know anything about anesthesia, but I do have a dog with an elevated ALKP level. He had a dental done about 6 months ago and did fine. Discuss your concerns with your vet.<br>  <br>  One thing you may also want to ask about is a liver support supplement. My dogs have used two with success. Denemarin and Denosyl. Good luck to your dog. You are doing the right thing getting the pre-surgical bloodwork done. I can understand your concerns.|`|o93EwErKaa	The anesthesia is most likely propofol" (brand name Rapinovet).  Her alt levels are very high, more than double of the highest range.  Her alkp are more than triple the highest range.  Although propofol would be a good choice of anesthesia, it is a possibility that the dog will not be able to handle the anesthesia.  Talk to your vet about your concerns and his experience in anesthetizing dog's with obvious liver disease.  You might want to consider putting the dog on a product called Petalive Liver aid to see if you can get the liver values down prior to anesthesia.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	propofol is an induction anesthetic, then your dog will be maintained on either isoflurane or sevoflurane (gas anesthetics).  as long as your vet says its ok and your dog is on iv fluids for the surgery and antibiotics after she should be fine.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Propofol.  It's a good one, especially for older pets.  I think your vet is on the right track!  Some vets don't even carry that anesthetic!|`|So7lXdBKaa	your dog is coming to its life end    DO THE RIGHT THING  PUT HER TO SLEEP ,|`|l0qZNFQkaa	Propofol<br>   this drug is used in humans and is very safe for older animals.<br>   we use is on all are surgery's  it last about 4-6 minutes before the dog is waking up.  and to remove a mass that small if the vet is a quick surgeon<br>   that is all it should take. If the vet things there is a risk to your dog they should have told you so. Most vets don't like putting possible problem dog under   it is very stressful to the doctor and the Tech in surgery.<br>  <br>    we are doing dental's on 12-15 year old dog safely  these days.<br>  <br>   all that said.<br>   there is always a risk when putting any older animals under for anything. have they done chest X-rays/ to look and see if she has any masses in her chest?<br>   Goldens are a known breed to get horrible cancers. and if removing this is only to see what she has is kind of pointless if it has spread to her lung already. and if it is  a cancer will you put her threw Chemo at this age?<br>  <br>  If it where my dog and the mass isn't bothering her I would want to know if she has masses in her lungs  or in her  abdomen.<br>   the liver can be elevated do to a mass in her abdomen <br>   any ways good luck i hope it all works out for you and your pup!
51St5GEcaa	the only thing you can do is make sure he's as comfy as possible and leave him be. Check in on him every so often. He might heal himself. He might have hurt himself getting caught on his wheel, or some other toy.|`|YRTYXfggaa	Leave him alone.  By messing with his leg, you could make it worse.  If a vet won't help him, the best thing for him to heal is time.|`|GrYhFNMdaa	If you love him so much then why is he suffering? The vet should be able to do something. Take him to another vet to get a second opinion because that sounds a bit strange to me. You cant do anything for him because you don't know what you are doing.|`|JxIKUC9baa	you either take him to any vet. or say i love him and take the best care of him you can. you coulkd try to take him to a petstore they help af7s well|`|KOtMicRKaa	I would just not handle him very much and let him ride it out he will heal soon enough probably in about a week or 2 if its not to serious he could just be sore. Hope i helped|`|hQ6ZqHjzaa	Your hamster needs a vet!. How do you know there are no vets in your city that take hamsters. Most vets wil take rodents, it does't have to be a special rodent vet, most vets will, so if you live in a city there will be more than one vet there that will take him. Also a vet cannot put your hamsters to sleep unless you give them permission to! So don't even try to make that excuse. I think the fact of the matter is you can't be bothered to take your hamster to the vet, and I think that's disgusting. Your hamster could die, and when you bought him, you also bought the responsibility to look after him and care for him and this includes taking him to a vet when he needs to go!<br>  <br>  Seeing as its his back as well as his leg, it could be very serious and he could die. A vet could at least give him a painkiller to stop the pain. If there's no blood or anything there is nothing much you can do but leave him alone and keep him in a quiet place to reduce stress. Without a vet depending on the seriousness of the injury he may heal if its not bad, but if he doesn't he will most likely die. At least if you take him to the vet he can be given a pain killer if they can;t do anything else for him and then you can take him home and he can go in a familiar environment instead of having to suffer and be in pain.<br>  <br>  Take him to a vet!|`|PaVyuYVUaa	if you really love this animal you'll do wats best for him, rite? well your animal is obviously in a lot of pain and 1 day feels like 2 to them and 1 hour feels like 2 hours to them. your hamster is suffering and it needs to be put out of his pain. i know its hard but he needs to be put down. i know how it feels. my hamster had a tumor in her stomach and she was in so much pain that the vet told my mom that she needed to be put down and i was at skool when she finally put her down. i LOVED that hamster and if i was there i would have led onto her forever, but i would have realized that she was not going to happy in that pain. i know how you feel but your hamster needs to go to hamster heaven and run on all the wheels and eat all the sunflower seeds it wants and frolic with all the other hamsters. i wish you the best and i hope you make the right desicion.

These are questions that most reputable breeders would ask because they do want their dogs to go to a good home but... is this person an actual experienced breeder? It seems very odd to me that a reputable dog breeder would say that they need to give the puppies away because they don't have room for them. I would definitely ask for her to resend the pictures just so you can see what she claims to actually have. What breed of dog is it, there are some that would sell for $2000 but that would make me all the more skeptical about her just giving them away.|`|gwUMipsUaa	The fact that they are willing to sell a puppy to someone they haven't met should tell you something.<br>  <br>  The questionnaire is just to make them look good.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	this is a scam, why would she need to sell  or give her puppies away LONG DISTANCE without having ever met the new owner?<br>  think about it!

gz5O9Tbpaa	Have you looked at the Airedale? They are much larger than 40lbs though. But they dont shed much and are very smart!|`|I38WF5aFaa	English Mastiff.  Its one of the world's largest breeds and has a very thin coat.|`|TXP8TnNFaa	Maybe a Irish Wolfhound or Great Dane.|`|AA11065140	I have to agree with Marsha H...a Standard Poodle would be a great option.  They shed so little, that they're actually considered "hypo-allergenic".  And they're great pets..they're patient and gentle with kids, love to be lazy on the couch, but also love to get out and run around, and are awesome as watch dogs, since they're very loyal.<br>  <br>  Below is a link to the American Kennel Club's Poodle breed standard.  The only difference between the Toy Poodle, the Miniature Poodle, and the Standard Poodle is size, with the Standard being the largest of the breed.  Obviously, you don't have to trim your pet as you would with a show dog, but there are some fun examples on the site, as well.|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	I have cared for a lot of dogs a few large dogs that stick in my mind that didn't really shed all that much were.

They don't shed, so for some people they may be less prone to sneeze around them, but they still produce dander which is what makes you sneeze and have an allergic reaction.|`|awio5lIjaa	if you need a larger dog that doesn't shed you should get a hypoallergenic they almost never shed. once i saw this breed called a Portuguese water dog and it was very friendly and fuzzy and playful, an all-around nice dog and maybe you should look into it.|`|cURFUJRRaa	There aren't really any dogs that don't shed ANY but there actually are quite a few that shed very little or only at certain times. Malamutes and Alaskan Huskies do something that's called "blowing" their coats, which means they lose their coats in hunks and they do it a few times a year so it isn't like a constant loss of hair. <br>  A few more breeds that are said to shed lightly are giant schnauzers, Greyhounds, Wire-haired fox terriers, Airedale terriers, and Standard poodles.|`|MGfBOuUNaa	get a mix breed, they love you so much more I have a Black Lab mix with Pit bull, don't worry he has not bitten a single Animal or person in his life, but he is so nice he loves me and licks me and i don't know what i would do without him, that proves that shelter dogs are more loving, and he hasn't shed a single hair in his life!

FLLVtAdEaa	I suggest getting a crate, or at least confining her to a small area. Dogs won't defecate/urinate in their sleeping quarters.<br>  <br>  You may need to go back to basics in house breaking.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Chances are something happened when you left her outside all day.  I would stop doing that.  Only have her outside when you can be out there to supervise.<br>  <br>  Here's my story on that.  Our first two dogs, we left them outside when we were gone all day.  One day our neighbor told us of two guys that came up to our yard looking at one of our dogs.  My neighbor told us how puppy mills and dog fighters look for dogs that are left outside all day, and take these dogs.  So we stopped doing that, and only had them outside when we were home, but not outside with them.  Then we started finding strange rocks in our yard.  Turns out kids were throwing rocks at our dogs.  So we only had them outside when we could supervise after that.|`|UyAGXNCsaa	Are you sure there isn't anything medically wrong with her?  Have you had her checked out by her vet?  If she appears ok, the best solution would be to crate her at night.  She'll let you know when she needs to go and you can praise her when she does.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	it's unfortunate. you may want to buy a pan and also buy litter. also, you can take the pet for a walk to let the pet use the restroom outside.|`|Jt0MYtXmaa	nice|`|kf7XLE8kaa	I've been through some really similar stuff with my dog.  When we first brought him home, he would NOT let us sleep.  He'd keep us up, literally, ALL freakin' night long.  Someone suggested a crate, so we researched crate training, and got him one, and it worked wonders.  I would suggest that as the #1 priority.<br>  <br>  After a year or so, we stopped using the crate.  I don't think it was for any particular reason...I think we left it outside after a long trip and were too tired to clean it up and bring it back in before bedtime, so he slept with us.  He was an absolute angel.<br>  <br>  Every once in awhile, he'll start having issues at night again.  Usually, it has something to do with us being gone for too long.  (My brother in law passed away a couple weeks ago, and we were gone for five days.  We have a friend who comes to take care of the dogs while we're gone, but still, five days is a LONG time for K to not see us, and it freaks him out.)  When he starts getting anxious over us being gone too much (or feeling not a part of the family), he'll start keeping us awake at night and eliminating inside the house, usually right in front of my husband's chair, or right beside us while we watch tv so that we KNOW he's (literally) p*ssed.   <br>  <br>  Anyway, we usually wait a few days to see if it continues.  If it does, he'll spend a few nights, or up to a couple weeks in the crate at night.  We don't use it as a punishment.  He seems to be comforted by the close walls, as though he knows exactly where his world ends, and when Mom and Dad are gone too much, he DOESN'T know where his world ends...like it's too much for him to comprehend.  I don't know how to explain it, but he seems to always come away from his night-crate-time much more peaceful and self-assured.  And he stops eliminating in the house, too.  :-)|`|AA11367986	As you get older you will have to get up in the middle of the night and go to the restroom also.  The fact that she does it by the front door tells you she wants out.

Everytime i would take her out and she will pee or poop i would give her a treat when she came inside. Yes she did accident so i would tell her and point at it and say NO .. take her out for 5 min or so and put her up.. that was punishment. but it didnt take me long to train her like that.. shes now 7 months and still getting treats.. she was also sleeping with us as well and would not let us sleep. .. but if you tell her over and over " go nite nite" every night she will get the picture.. or give her a treat like a bone and she will settle down.. good luck.. it helped me.. i didnt have to spend money for someone else train.. just be patient..|`|P8TvAHsYaa	Dogs don't came ready - trained. U need to do it yourself.<br>  <br>  First when she looks like she wants to pee or poo, or after she has had a meal, take her to her litter box and put her in it. Dig a hole with a spade or something and place her on top. Do it a number or times till she gets the message. If she doesn't, the best thing is to keep her in your garden, dogs aren't ment to be house pets|`|jvURAYDxaa	First of all...don't ever get angry with your dog....and don't ever holler at or hit her, and for gods sake, don't mush her nose in her pee!  sheeeesh! I would continue to keep her in your bedroom at night as usual. I would also revisit basic house training...i.e outside to potty every 2 hours or so...whether she goes or not. It sounds like your dog has become anxious about something in your room. Until you figure out what, (has anything changed in your room since the problem started?)...I would give her the pills the vet prescribed. They won't hurt her, and you will both get a good nights sleep. Why is she outside all day and is she alone there?|`|vtDl2w0Vaa	Well, as for the peeing, she might  have a urinary tract infection. Take her to the vet just in case. I'm not sure what else it could be, sorry. I'm having the same problem with my 1 year old dachshund. Although, she was never completely housebroken.<br>  <br>  You might also want to put some pee pads overtop of the places that she usually goes, for your own sake. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped! :)

To me they are perfect one has been bred for racing so has a broad chest & lots of shoulder muscles (not KC perfect for the breed) & the 15 month old puppy is perfect apart from she lost half her tail in an accident I could show her but that is CRUEL.  A dog is a dog, pedigree dogs are ok but only if they are checked out prior to being bred to make sure thye have no hip, eye, brain problems. They have to inbreed at some point but somewhere down the line they are all crossed with something else.  All dogs come from the basic wolf so KC is a waste of time.|`|7tDDXKEOaa	The KC has recognized lots of breeds pf dogs.

Genetics of dog breeding is an art. You have to know which characteristics are passed on to eliminate something or to strengthen something. A true dog breeder know what he is doing when he makes a father-daughter cross. Mother-son cross also can be done.|`|bx7qmKbGaa	I do agree with their overall purpose- to keep dogs in standard and quality bred  so that they can serve their original purposes. But in later years, they have seemed to go a bit too far. I do not agree with line breeding, but then again, I am no breeder.<br>  <br>  To tell you the truth, I really don't know what to think of dog breeding any more. Reputable ones are getting hard to come by!<br>  <br>  Also, to the first answerer- You would be really surprised.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Don't even try telling me that there isn't a little line breeding in the dog in your avatar.<br>  Now breeding as close as father-daughter is something that should never be attempted by someone that doesn't have a complete understanding of how genetics work. Inbreeding, line breeding, out cross, it makes no difference, the pups can only be the product of the genes provided by the parents. If a dog can provide some goofy 3 legged dog gene in an inbreeding, it can provide that same gene in an out cross.<br>  BTW the K C Spaniel thing is getting to be old news, where have you been hiding for the last year and a half.<br>  <br>  quote<br>  "To me this is crazy !!!!!!!!!!'<br>  <br>  To me you have no clue, is your rant over now?|`|OFaImbSiaa	the whole point of it is to examine breeding stock<br>  <br>  you want the best example of the breed to be the future of the breed<br>  <br>  ADD: I agree with basset about your spelling<br>  <br>  ADD again: They are not "scams". It IS to evaluate breeding stock, to see which dog fits his breed standard the best. To FIND the dog(s) that should continue the breed.
AA12063605	I use to have a cat that would only drink water from a glass that I would set on the bath-tub floor. she always  had fresh water too--never figured out why she did this--I guess every cat has their own quirks!|`|GmbeNHNgaa	I have 2 cats and one of them does the same thing!

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	You got an unusual labs because most labs are hyperactive well into their adult years.  They are intelligent dogs that NEED training to keep them under control.  And they make good agility test dogs because they are so eager to please their human companion.  Your puppy needs to be acclimated to her new situation, meet and greet the other dogs she comes in contact with (labs are generally loving dogs who love other dogs ("oh good, a playmate!!!")).  She may have come from a home where she didn't get the usual stimuli and encouragement puppies ought to get.  She might just be adjusting to a new home, new situation, new people and animals and things.  Encourage her to play--they're retrievers to usually they catch on to I-toss, you-get play really fast (and then drive you crazy always wanting to play toss and retrieve).  But you may have gotten the one in a thousand lab that's just super mellow (but usually they would still be playful and full of energy).|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	They may seem laid back compared with a border collie..lol.<br>  But it varies, my lab was very laid back and mature at a young age.<br>  I hear of others that complain that their lab is rambunctious and out of control for a couple of years.<br>  Just sitting there and not playing with the other dogs outside would make me a little worried.... Has this dog seen a vet or had any shots or de-worming?|`|hoDvh61waa	just because the puppy wants to be with you or doesn't want to play doesn't necessarily mean that they're lazy or that there is a problem with them. border collies are very energetic dogs and other dogs could seem very lethargic compared to them but that doesn't make them lazy. however, puppies are usually hyper and playful, although each one is different. if you've seen this dog act differently and more energetically before she could be sick or something.|`|RwQmN7Reaa	She's likely just a very calm lab puppy which is a rare thing to find especially at that age. It is surprising that she didn't go running to play with the other pups as well. I have seem some very mellow puppies but they usually still play with one another.|`|0MA7RLXDaa	LABS ARE WILD!!!!!<br>  <br>  i have a black lab/ german shepp and he is reallllllllly crazy....ummm they chew things when they get bored. they always need to have something to do...supposedly, labs dont have thier full brians untill about 4 years old....<br>  <br>  mine is a boy btw.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Not at all. I've had labs all my life and they were never lazy, even as they got older. <br>  <br>  Maybe she is just scared being in a new home? But she could also just be a mellow calmer (not lazy) lab.|`|AA12183510	My lab is 8 weeks old and hyper as ever! I swear shes never calm. At some point in time during the day shes liable to fall over and pass out for a nap. Only for a short period of time before shes at it again! ha ha
vS1Z0inOaa	Not really...<br>     Sometimes you can feel them by touching her hips in front of her back legs. Also if you notice she's having a craving for cuttlebone or is suddenly restless, pacing and trying to get out, that's a good sign she's got eggs.<br>     But, honestly, half the time you can't feel them and you don't know until either there is a problem or they lay the eggs. The only sure way to know is an X-ray.<br>     Even the fact whether a male is present or not does not matter--just 'cause a male is there does not always mean they mate and just 'cause a male is not there does not mean she won't produce eggs; they'll just not be fertile. On top of that, a turtle can produce good eggs for 4 years after mating once as their body will store the sperm. I once had a female turtle I adopted as an adult and she laid two good eggs 18 months after I brought her home.|`|p4kex5J7aa	Nope, because of the shell :/
9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	He's is probably worn out from taking care of babies.  He is probably enjoying the rest and dry weather.  You might just bring all the babies inside.  I don't know where you are living, but this time of year in most climates, parakeets need heat at night in an outdoor aviary.  <br>  He should get better on his own as long as he is still eating.  Parakeets should eat approx. every four hours, if he stops eating he is likely to die of starvation.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Your budgie sounds like it may have a respiratory problem.  All the symptoms you mentioned are a sign of an illness.  I would take him to the vet as soon as possible.  Birds tend to hide their illnesses unitl it's too late, so time is very important.  The vet can treat him and help him get better.|`|aHX6ug2Yaa	Well there is probly  that eye crust so then his eyes get wet that's how animals are. Also when he fluffed up he is probley trying to get attention. but just in case take him to the vet idmitally.|`|AA11207909	Go to a Veterinarian and get a antibiotic liquid for the bird's drinking water.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Birds do not catch colds so that is not the problem.  However, he is very ill.  Bringing him in is good.  But you also need to give him a bit of supplemental heat by placing a heating pad, on low, only under the rear half of his  cage.  Getting overheated is as bad as getting chilled so he needs to be able to move away from it.  He is also in danger of getting dehydrated due to the diarrhea so be sure he has fresh water and you can also offer some Pedialyte in a separate bowl.  That's very good for him if he will take some.  As for Mom and the little ones, you really need to bring them in as well.  With the male being ill, he will not be of any help to her probably, but it will help keep his and her, stress levels down to at least be near each other.  Since she is having to do it all on her own now, she needs your help and they need to be in where you can keep a close eye on everything.  I suggest you go to a pet store, get some of the baby bird formula.  It comes in powder form and you will mix just a very small portion with warm water, to about the consistency of oatmeal.  Do not try to feed the chicks, unless you are an experienced hand feeder.  You could kill them.  But make the formula available to her so she can feed it to the chicks.  You can also offer some to the male.  If he will also take some, it will help keep his strength up.  But, bottom line, as others mentioned, he really needs to be seen by a good Avian vet also.  Good luck with this very bad situation.
tPGxPDvBaa	Yes they are when grown. There is a very good reason I didn't adopt my danes until they were older pups & mostly out of the terror stage.  I have heard stories about being on the bed & jumping up & pulling down the ceiling fan etc. My best advice is to start good obedience training now - I started my 1st dane at 7mo for not behaving & it made a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!   You will enjoy her - they are such big goofs!|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Puppies aren't born well mannered. They need training. A 12 week old puppy of any breed/mix is usually a handful....get your puppy into obedience classes, get started training. If you put the time & effort into proper training & socializing you will have a well mannered adult dog.<br>  <br>  Danes are very smart, very trainable dogs.|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	I love Great Danes. But you also have to know how to handle an animal that is going to be big enough to drag you down the street lol. I suggest looking into puppy kindergarten to learn the basics of training your dog. Puppies are generally terrors lol it is just their nature they will do everything they are not supposed to and it is the job of the owner to teach the dog what is ok to do and what is not.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Well im not sure what your description of terror is but puppies are playful and like to get into things. Dogs have to be trained and it doesn't happen overnight.<br>  <br>  And yes Great Danes are great dogs, with the right training.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	They are great dogs, but they need training just like any other dog. Most Large breed dogs are awful unless you work with them daily. Most dogs chew large breed eat furniture, get lots of chew toys. <br>  They calm at around 1 1/2 or 2 years old. Good Luck!|`|cnPKAlDYaa	When it becomes a mature dog it should be ....remember at the moment you still have a puppy and it will be for a fair while yet|`|ZSXstSXBaa	When I evacuated for Hurricane Gustav my friend had another friend there who had a great dane and a cat. Well, I have a 64lb. american pit bull (Gypsi) and the great dane was so massive that my pit would hardly go by it. One day they were outside together and the dane charged (charged, not attacked) at Gypsi. Neither of them got hurt I just think it scared Gypsi. Other than that their dane was sweet. She drooled a lot though which is something I'm not used to. She also liked to try to sit on you which was not very comfortable considering their size! That's all I really know about the breed. You can go to www.dogbreedinfo.com to get particulars. Also, some stuff you can correct early with puppy training classes! I know pet smart offers them nationwide but if  you want something more personal you can look in your local yellow pages.|`|YcYNMDqBaa	I have also heard they are good dogs. puppies are usually terrors! i know mine was. but she will probablly grow out of it.<br>  Although, the only thing i am sure of with these breeds is that their life expectancy isn't so high. <br>  <br>  hope that helps some.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	They are GREAT dogs! They are loving and social animals.<br>  when ever a dog is a terror its always because of the people who own the dogs even when they dont know it.<br>  <br>  what is your dog doing?|`|OFaImbSiaa	Well that would depend on YOU training it.......|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	what they meant was they are well tempered and they are but you still have to train them

JGq9rKBOaa	Honestly, I've never met cats who didn't eventually get used to each other. <br>  <br>  I spent years working with feral cat rescue, which meant there was pretty much a never-ending rotation of cats going through my house. Some were permanent residents, others came in as kittens that I would hand-feed and adopt out, others came and left as adults. The "old" cats would always hiss at the new arrivals a few times, but as annoyed as they seemed, they always got over it. <br>  <br>  I probably had literally hundreds of cats and hundreds of introductions, and never did I experience a cat who didn't tolerate others.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It's possible.  Ask the shelter to show you cats who have shown to receptive to strange cats.  Anytime you introduce a new cat into a home with an existing cat, they need a transition period to get used to each before face to face introductions.  Set up a room for the new kitty and let her stay there for a couple of days so each cat gets used to the other's scent.  After a vet clears the new kitty of any contagious infections or diseases, allow short supervised visits.  Expect some hissing from either or both cats.  As things progress you can allow more time together.  Usually it takes 2-4 weeks for things to calm down depending on the cats.  Be sure both cats are fixed.  We don't want to be adding to pet overpopulation.<br>  <br>  While bringing your cat to a shelter to pick out a friend might seem like a good idea, cats are much more territorial than dogs and don't just take up with each other.  They have to feel each other out for a bit before becoming receptive.  Shelters are breeding grounds for diseases and infections because there are so many cats together in one place.  Infections like URI and FIV can spread like wildfire if you're not careful.|`|1f93fa3c5a4f157aadd42c2fd3953d4caa	This is what you should do:<br>  Let your cat visit, make sniffing contact with a bunch of female cats at the shelter, and the one he likes is the one that you should bring home. <br>  <br>  My friend did this with a dog. He had an older dog, and introduced him to the puppy this way. They liked each other right away!<br>  <br>  And older dog picked out a beagle puppy! How cute is that?|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Yes they can become friends but be prepared for a few days of settling in.  The male will think that this female is coming into his territory so you may have a few issues to start with.<br>  <br>  If the male cat is desexed, this will also help a lot.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	it is not likely he will become friends with a male or female.<br>  <br>  you can try,they might form a pride.<br>  <br>  introduce slowly, see what happens.<br>  <br>  i would take a cat home for the weekend, before i adopt.
tT256JQRaa	thats gonna be A LOT of work.<br>  you can get powdered puppymilk or animal formula or something, and feed it either with a eye dropper or by putting drops of milk in the crease of your finger and letting the mouse lick it.<br>  <br>  you'll have to make sure its kept warm and safe, maybe in a small box or something with soft hay or shredded toilet paper, you'll have to stimulate it to go to the bathroom as it cant do it on its own - get a q-tip or cotton ball, or even your finger, dip in it warm water and very gently massage its private parts until it 'does its business'<br>  do you have any idea how old the baby is?<br>  if its still got its eyes closed then i'm gonna guess its no older than a week, so you'll have to feed it every 2 hours in the day, and once at nice, massaging its back end again a while after feeding<br>  <br>  you could also buy nursing mother mice from a lot of petshops and other places, and though these are fancy mice and not fieldmice, it'd still save a lot of work on your half and probably give the baby a better chance.<br>  <br>  with all this in mind though the baby probably wont survive (its almost completely unheard of for mice just to have one baby - what happened to the others?), no matter how hard you try, and you probably werent considering it but just in case, dont feed it to any captive reptile you might know, as its a wild animal and so could have diseases or parasites that could be passed on to the reptile.<br>  <br>  good luck anyways, and i hope he makes up - keep us updated :)|`|TrEDiWR7aa	get supplement milk and keep him warm<br>  chances are not good though, dont get your hopes up. sorry :(|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Please call your local wild animal rescue unit.

The heats will continue around every 6 months for the rest of her life, unless she is spayed and then the heats will stop.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Your dog is a fink?<br>  <br>  Or is her name Fink?<br>  <br>  Fink can go into heat at any time, so best get her spayed soon.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	anywhere between 6 months and a year..<br>  then they stay in heat for 3 weeks..one coming in, one in and one going out..|`|24CFl7sjaa	anytime from 6 months on, so watch her.|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Is Fink your way or saying Think?   iF so, WOW.|`|aGynBPbCaa	fink...<br>  <br>  lol, 6 months|`|Nj36OUPFaa	yea probably between 6-12 months.. i heard it better to let them go trough one 1 heat bc its better for her body but don't let her go through a couple bc she boobs will drop and look reallly saggy.. it looks bad and she will bleed all over your house.. get her fixed a.s.a.p unless you want to breed her.|`|PEkMPkrgaa	they will start panting really hard... and other stuff i dont want to mintion....................................|`|16XpYCBmaa	They can go into around 6-8 months of age.
