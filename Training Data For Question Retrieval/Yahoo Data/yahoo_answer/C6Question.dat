If I pay then will I not have to do anything else? For example: Court or classes.

20090202101211AAcXTFK	Politics & Government;Politics	Why have we forgotten the false claims of the Environmentalist propaganda book The Population Bomb?	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Populat...    The Population Bomb, a bestseller published in 1968, predicted that overpopulation would occur in the last 3 decades of the 20th century, causing famines on a massive scale and that the government needs to act fast to limit population growth.  It was the Inconvenient Truth of its time and was very popular in schools during the 1970s.    The proposals made back then bare a striking resemble to those made by environmentalists today to stop Global Warming.  Some people proposed that government limit each woman to 2 babies within her lifetime, in order to prevent population growth.  In contrast to this proposal, a "free market" cap-and-trade proposal was also made, whereby each woman would receive 2 "babyrights" at birth and would be able to trade them on the market.    If Environmentalists were wrong about their scare story of "overpopulation" 40 years ago, why should we believe them now when they say that "Global Warming" is going to be a catastrophe?

20090202103308AAia4kS	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Taking away parental rights?	My sister has a baby who is 12 months old. The father of the baby did not see the child at all until the state took him to court for child support they did a DNA (at 7 months) test he comes around when convenient she took the baby to see him he was not there just his girlfriend. She even waited on him to show up and never did. A few times he has not came to see her at scheduled times (that they among themselves set up). He makes lies up (like a family death or being sick but then going out and partying) so that he can get out of his scheduled visit that they arranged. Now mind you, visits are not court ordered. The baby has her mothers last name. Today they went to court for child support-- the father doesn't have a job. She decided not to set up child support and has made an appointment with her lawyer for parental rights. She wants to get any rights he might have or can have  and any visitations that he could be ordered through the courts diminished, have you- she knows she made a great mistake. But she is a good girl and has an outstanding fiancee. He wants to adopt her after they get married but not until then (which we understand) He has been there for this baby since the day she was born, he's been the one putting in the father support and taking care of her and loving her as his own. She called the clerks office to see if she could obtain his legal records. He has 4 underage consumption charges, 1 simple possesion, 1 capias currently on him, and a violation of probation in Jan. She has copies and is going to give them to her lawyer. She also has documented every thing between the two of them regarding the baby.    Now- my question... Given the circumstances, does anyone know how hard it is to have rights taken away from a parent? Does some one have to step in on the birth certificate JUST TO have his rights taken? Will he remain on the cert until someone signs rights for her? Can anyone help us out on this with information or experience?   Thanks.

20080730003437AA80Zau	Politics & Government;Immigration	Il a été prouvé qu'il n'y a qu'une race dans l'espèce humaine. Pourquoi continuer à penser que fran?ais=blanc?	Le nombre de liens scientifiques cités, de réponses de QRistes, montrent donc qu'on ne peut parler de races, mais de différences physiologiques rattachées au mode de vie. Même l'article de Herald Tribune cité par un QRiste démontre que c'est l'adaptation au milieu qui donne des différences, non raciales, mais physiologiques. On peut donc fermer ce sujet.      A partir de là, tout devient intéressant. Un QRiste s'indignait par exemple du fait que l'équipe de foot de France est au trois-quarts noire, alors que selon lui la population fran?aise compte 80% de blancs. J'aurais envie de dire, quel est le rapport avec la choucroute? En quoi la parité blancs-noirs devraient être respectée à tous les niveaux? Puisque les différences physiologiques n'ont aucun rapport avec une origine génétique raciale. N'est-ce pas une vue de l'esprit, et dirais-je, une tendance névrotique?

Are there not better ways? With the state of our finances is this what the American people have to look forward to? Frivolous spending?      Mr. Obama -- whose jump shot earned him the nickname Barry O'Bomber at Hawaii's Punahou School -- has hired a team of cabinet members and aides with serious basketball backgrounds. Many of them are planning for regular court time with the president, according to Mr. Obama's transition press team.   "I think we are putting together the best basketball-playing cabinet in American history," the president-elect said at a news conference earlier this week.          http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12296471...

I know that the economy is in a bad spot but I have not herd even one politican talk about legalizing pot this year. To me its a big deal seeing as how I have too many friends who went to the slammer for no reason other than selling maryjane, which i don't even think deserves a ticket.       Even most of my republican buddys agree pot legalization is overdue. I mean the only excuse I have herd is that they have not done enough research on it. And my answer is "they have been researching it for 50 years, enough is enough". No one has ever overdosed on pot

"President Barack Obama is imposing a $500,000 pay cap on some senior executives whose firms receive government financial rescue money.   Obama said the lavish bonuses for some Wall Street executives was "shameful." The president described the new restrictions Wednesday..."      I understand the theory behind it, but where will it stop?  first its people taking government money, but then when the taxes stop coming in from these high salaries, where does it go next?      will the administration than say the stocks they bought to give companies capital, then they sell the stocks to regain the money, the company tanks. or they start imposing a tax on the people who own stock in the companies?

If he believes this why in the world would he be putting us deeper and deeper into debt?  Why all the handouts for programs that do nothing to stimulate the economy?      The housing disaster caused this recession so why is fixing this the primary and first priority.  Bailing out banks has failed and will continue to fail.      I like the Republican plan of a 4% fixed interest rate on mortgages and/or giving people a $15,000 credit toward the purchase of a home.  Doesn't this make more sense in turning the economy around and helping families than all the proposed social programs?      Once again, what is the hidden agenda of the liberals leaders of the Democratic party?      We really need to get involved just as we did about closing our borders.  However, as predicted it was only delayed until after the election and now it raises it ugly head at the expense of every average taxpaying American.

Minha opini?o!:      O Brasil é um país muito grande para que haja apenas uma lei para  todos os Estados.   Pior ainda é que estas leis s?o criadas e aprovadas por políticos que nem convivem nos estados atingidos por estas leis!      tipo: "com base na situ??o da violencia em S?o Paulo, será criada uma lei sobre seguran?a para todo o Brasil"!   ora, S?o Paulo é S?o Paulo!    Uma lei aplicada em SP, n?o serve para Paraná, Minas Gerais ou Rio Grande do Sul!      Temos uma cultura e sociedades diferentes em cada Estado!   As leis deveriam ser conforme a situa??o local!      Acredito que cada estado deveria ter e aplicar leis como :    Codigo Civil,    Codigo Penal,    Codigo de Transito e    Leis trabalhistas!   Nao seria egoísmo ou individualismo, mas é conforme cada local que deveria ter leis aplicávies!      O que acham?

"Swiss voters ratified new asylum and immigration laws Sunday making it more difficult for refugees to receive assistance and effectively blocking non-European unskilled workers from entering the country.       ADVERTISEMENT       More than 67 percent voted in favor of the stricter rules on asylum, originally approved by the Swiss government in December. The proposal was overwhelmingly accepted in all of Switzerland's 26 cantons, according to results released by the federal government.      Those refusing to leave despite a rejected application can now be denied social welfare. Adults deemed to be only posing as refugees can be imprisoned for up to two years, and children can be kept in state custody for one year even if they are never charged with a crime.      Sixty-eight percent of voters also approved new immigration rules that effectively cut off legal immigration routes for unskilled workers coming from non-European countries. "      What do you think?

20070221072952AAw2Fd1	Politics & Government;Elections	Santini viré de l'UDF, est ce ?a l'ouverture de Bayrou ???	C'est à mourir de rire, Bayrou propose de réunir des gens de droite comme de gauche mais s'efforce de virer des gens de son parti.   Je préfère largement Bayrou à Sarko mais là on est dans un manque de cohérance total. Si soutenir un candidat adverse suffit à être considérer comme un ennemi de Bayrou, je ne vois vraiment pas comment il va rassembler des gens de gauche qui n'ont jamais été à l'UDF ou des gens de droite inscrit à l'UMP.

Est ce parce que ceux qui ont accès à Internet, et par conséquent à de l'information non filtrée (sources Reuters, AP ou AFP), ont plus conscience de ce qui serait bien pour notre pays? Est ce parce qu'il n'y a pas de notion de "temps de parole" sur le net?      Est-ce parce que Bayrou a été l'un des premiers à s'engager sur le terrain du net?      Bref comment a-t-il conquiert cette frange de l'électorat?      Pour ma part, Internet n'a rien à voir la dedans puisque c'est le projet de constitution européenne qui m'a amené vers l'UDF mais je constate un capital sympathie plus important sur la toile que dans la vie quotidienne.

On pourra peut etre plus polémiquer la dessus car les 2 ont à peu prés le meme cout.   Moi, ce qui me dérange, c'est que Sarko est ultra libéral alors soit il ment avec sa rupture à tous les libéraux et il fera comme tout le monde .... soit il ment à la France et il appliquera sa politique à la Bush ou Thatcher.

Cette question n'est pas partisane mais provient de la simple observation. Ceal aussi sans compter tous les enarques (Messier, Schweitzer...) qui se sont engraisse sur des entreprises publics ou para-publics, et qui ont traine dans la corruption. Je connais pas mal d'enarques et leur suffisance est assez impressionante. Pourtant, les echecs repetes de leurs camarades devraient leur apprendre un peu plus d'humilite.
