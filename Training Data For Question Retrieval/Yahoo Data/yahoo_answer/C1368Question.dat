20090223155158AADkCf8	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dreams about raping your girlfriend??? is this normal?	my boyfriend told me that whenever we fight, the following night he has dreams of raping me, and he actually likes it, even though im crying and screaming in the dream, he says he just chokes me if im too loud, but he just keeps smiling (in the dream)      im not actually worried, i mean it sounds SICK but i figured thats just how he vents his frustration with me in his dreams      im not afraid, i know he'd NEVER do anything like that, ive been with him 3 years and he's never ever EVER done anything to hurt me         he thinks theres something wrong with him,   i think it's normal, in a weird way, we always have dreams of doing things we'd never do in real life       do you think this is a sign of something bad? or he's just looking into it too much???         im sure theres some Freud explanation out there to make this sound less threatening, if anyone knows something about that, that would be cool too =)          thanks a bunch

20090223160245AAC8qCw	Social Science;Psychology	What exactly is a pathological liar? And how do they differ from a regular liars?	There's a friend of mine that I notice lies all the time for no reason.      The way I see it, is that a normal liar will lie to get out of trouble, lie to make/save money, or tell a white lie to make someone feel good.      But this guy just lies all the time for no reason. Often it's inflated descriptions & exaggerations to make himself look good, but other times it has no real reason behind it. Like you could ask him what he had for breakfast and he'll say pancakes, bacon, & eggs for breakfast even though he had eggs & hashbrowns. Makes no sense why anyone would lie about that. There is nothing embarrassing about eating eggs & hashbrowns nor will it get you in trouble.      Are these the traits of a pathological liar?      Is it a medical condition? What exactly is a pathological liar and how are they different from regular liars?

Why?	 http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29336107/       Why do you think she hasn't been arrested yet? The friends & relatives of the guy have ALL unanimously said that he was not a violent person, was a good guy, and would never do anything to threaten anyone, especially his wife.      Why do you think she hasn't been arrested? She has two things going for her -- she's a woman, and she's a cop.
20090223161330AASPNkj	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does it mean when you have the same dream over and over?	When I was ages 3-8 I had the same dream, over and over and over. Almost exactly the same besides one thing was different. The dream was about me in the backseat of a car, and someone driving (it was a different person in each dream o.O) and we would drive down a very steep bridge/hill and we would start losing control then go off the side and ram into a tree. then that's when I would wake up. I remembered these dreams the other day (I'm 13 now) and talked to my mom about it, and she said my dream is exactly how her dad and sister died when she was young. Freaky, eh? Could I be the reincarnation of her sister if it's possible?

20090223162415AA4LXw7	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream I was pregnant?	I had a dream I was pregnant and we couldn't get to a hospital. I was laid out on a bed at home and people around me (not the father, I don't know who the father was) were telling me to have it right there, at home, but I didn't want to. I was terrified and thinking something might go wrong with the baby, so I close my legs and just held it. I still wanted to get to a hospital but was worried we might not make it in time and I'd give birth in a CAR but at home the baby was literally pushing from my stomach wanting to come out. It was a really freaky dream! What does it mean?

20090223163206AAEuuL0	Social Science;Psychology	Why is getting a life and girlfriend so difficult?	I am a shy guy. I am not very shy once I am comfortable around people, but making the first move is very difficult. Every time I try and reach out for something it seems like it gets more and more OUT of reach. I don't understand it. I am 23 years old, I am in great shape, I work out and am told I am very handsome, mostly by older people though, people my age never compliment each other. When your a quiet guy and nobody gives you anything to work with, it gets really hard. As a guy a lot of pressure is on you to make the first move, take control and speak up for yourself, but its so hard. My parents always tell me to make new friends, get a life, etc. but its easy to say that to someone else because they aren't the ones that have to actually do it. I just get sad and lonely. I wish I had a fun girl to be around but I have been rejected alot in the past and teased and picked on growing up, so I tend to have an anger towards women and I always feel that attractive women are judgmental and will analyze me too much. Im not that guy thats surrounded by women and gets alot of attention and crushes, which is what girls are attracted to. I am sort of older beyond my years, meaning I am more mature and relate with older people, but thats not going to get me a social scene or young gf who is my age for that mater. Does anyone else have these issues or know what would help?

20090223162908AAMGz8t	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why does this keep happening to me?!!!?	Ok I know its bad and i VERY MUCH REGRET IT, but i messed around w a married man for a year. The whole time all my friends would tell me he was just using me and it would never progress into a real relationship. Well finally I listened to them and told him I dont want anymore contact w him. I avoid the gym now at the times I know he might be there and in general avoid the places I think he might be. When me and him were talking, he would never talk to me on his cell or text me BC he got caught by his wife and I used to drive around looking for him in places and I would never ever see him out around town. Well now that I am away from him and I dont want anymore contact w him, I see him and his wife every week it seems. Last week I saw her 2 diff days and today I was sitting at a stop light and he pulled up next to me. I just cant believe how I am seeing him everywhere and trying to avoid him so much. I was just wondering if you think there is some reason for it... as in maybe if I see him, then it will help me get over him more and more???? I really dont know but its bugging me. I get so freaked out when I see him BC I really had true feelings for him and loved him very much. I know I am stupid but its the truth and I am still getting over it. Seeing him or his wife is not helping. What should I do or act next time I see him around town?

20090223163431AA0EQJ2	Social Science;Psychology	This year has been less socialble than i imagined. Can i change it?	Hello,           I was excited to join the 6th form college at my school. I had visions of my social life improving, meeting more girls, making new friends, going to party's etc. but.... that wasn't the outcome. I ended up doing a BTEC course because i failed to achieve 5 A*'s - C at GCSE. That was a shame to me but i do want a good future so i continued my education and went onto the ICT BTEC course. It's great so far. The course involves me going to three different schools over the five day period of school. It was hard at first. I didn't know anyone i was going to be with and going to two new schools is a shock also. I'm fine on the course now though. I'm in my default school two days a week doing key skills lessons. As i'm on the BTEC course the people i am with in the lessons are more of the "chavvy/mean" side. I am friendly with all of them. I have no problems with them, but i feel lonely. I talk to allot of people around school and have many friends. But i don't seem to have a good social life. I don't have like a clique. I have people i hang around with but i don't seem to be close to many other people. Most of my friends went onto A Level so i don't see them much anymore :(. People just don't seem to want to talk to me alot. Like we all know hoe eachother is as we have been all together for six years. I'm not ugly (i hope lol) i'm not a snob, im not a chav, im not dumb just unfortunate. Is there anyway i can improve my school life? and is this just happening because i am seperated from the place i set my social visions on? thanks for reading guys.

They keep telling him that Daddy is with the Lord now but I said allow him to greive in his own way & time.      Did I say the right thing?

Cuando era ni?a, 5 a?os aproximadamente me hicieron una especie de test, me dijeron que haga un dibujo que contenga una casa, cerca, arbol, y camino es lo que mas recuerdo, yo dibuje una casa lo mejor que pude, una cerca alrededor de la casa, 2 arboles (nose porque) y un camino recto que salia de la puerta de la casa, al concluir nos dijeron que la casa creo nos representaba a nosotros mismos, la cerca a nuestro papá, el camino mostraba el rumbo de nuestra vida mas o menos y el arbol a nuestra mamá, pero yo era la unica de todos que habia hecho 2 arboles, nadie me dijo nada y lo habia olvidado hasta que mi mamá murio hace 4 a?os, entonces lo recorde todo, ... tiene esto algun sentido?

The wierd thing was that it didnt bother me. The dream then skipped to me sitting on the couch with some guy (who wasnt my boyfriend) we were holding hands and talking but when my boyfriend walked in the room I dropped the guys hand and pretended like nothing was happening. Then I woke up. I am nineteen and my boyfriend is 20. We have been together for almost 3 years. Any ideas what this could mean?
20070412125811AAxSxZZ	Social Science;Psychology	How DO I become a Relationship COACH? where do I begin, help?	Hi, I am trying to become a relationship coach, but I don't know where to start!There are so many different programs, such as the ICF, CoachU, etc, and I don't know where to begin, what program to go thru, which hours transfer to who, etc. I think that the ICF requires a certain # of hours in order to be certified, but where can I get those hours? I went to their website and it was still confusing. What programs are approved by the ICF? It doesn't look like the ICF offers any training hours on 'relationship' coaching, only life coaching. Is the Coach Traning Alliance a legit program? Do I hav to get my life coaching certification first, then the relationship coaching certification? About what are the costs for these prgrams? I just want to get my liscence/certification/credent... within the year. Help, where do I begin on this path, and then what do I do?    PS: i'm a college graduate with a BA in organizational communication, minor in psych. and have a true nack for coaching..

20070713094743AAElhQm	Social Science;Psychology	Why are there mixed signals? (10 pts)?	There's this gal that I like and I've told her how I felt last year, but she said she just wanna be friends. However, recently I feel that she puts more interests, except that in this year's students retreat she showed a totally different behavior. She was rather unwell during the retreat and had to take antibiotic.    - Sometimes she did not reply to what I said, when we were in groups.   - When I asked her about the bruise that she got previously, she did not listen clearly and was like moving her head to beckon me to repeat my words. But finally she only said, "I don't know..." and looked at the bruise.   - I asked her a few things, like 'You're sleepy?' but she just kept quiet.    - She once like said that 'Common sense, who will believe that..." when I belived what a friend said.   - During a campfire dance, I danced with her first, but she did not smile and instead was like rather a bit silent, but the next one she smiled a bit.   But they are complete opposite to what she had shown some time ago. She was friendly and teased me and seemed to be interested, lots of eye contacts. But now, she seemed cold, distant and quiet. What actually happens? But she talks to other boys, but seems rather quiet with me. I am shy with her too. And she seemed to be more distant from her pals too. She’s often alone and is very quiet in bus.

20070725070954AAnHu9M	Social Science;Psychology	Can I get meds for this?	Ive had this problem forever, and I finally told my mom and were going to a doctor. also, do you think its ocd? because my mom thinks it is, ok, heres my problem;   Im so sad, and I have been off and on for about a year. It started last year when I had this though it my head, "what if Im not real, oranyone else around me, and this is some deep figment of my imagination or something?" Whenever this thought isnt in my head, I feel fine, happy. But when this thought enters my head, Im just so miserable, Ill think nothing matters because its not real. I will be looking forward to an event, but then I think,"I shouldnt be excited, its not real" and then everything feels, imaginary. Like Christmas, for example, my favorite time of year, it just makes me feel so amazing, but when it came up last year, I was just sad the whole time because I felt it wasnt real

I dreamed I was in a store like Lowes and I looked up, this guy came in with a baseball bat and really scary eyes. Everyone in the store started running out and staring in horror. I looked behind me and saw more guys with bats and they were looking at me. It was like I was watching myself from above and also from the floor. I had two versions of this dream before I awoke.   1. The guy hit me and I saw myself get killed   2. I jumped on this chain hanging from the ceiling and climbed up. I pulled the chain up with me and was dialing 911. The guy threw the bat at me and I was trying to protect my head and it broke my phone. I somehow got the bat and batting the other bats at the other people. The police came in and stopped them. I came down and the cops started to hit me with the night sticks. I woke up.    What does this mean?
