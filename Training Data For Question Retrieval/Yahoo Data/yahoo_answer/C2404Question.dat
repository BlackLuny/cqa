Hi, I just finished reading "The Game" by Neil Strauss and watched the Pick up Artist season 1 and just found it interesting that all these techniques might work to get girls into bed. Are these all techniques that work for men because of confidence or do these techniques have some kind of meaning behind them and not just about confidence? Lastly I wanted to ask, when using these techniques, and actually picking up a girl and "falling in love with her", do you change your personality from being an "asshole" or not being yourself to being who you really are? Thank you in advanced -Eric

20090202222616AAEsLnw	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The Bible, is it simply a book?	Think about it, when a book is written to avoid becoming preachy and full of nothing but messages it includes a story and interesting fantasy topics to get people interested.      Lets be honest with ourselves religious people....      -a man cannot walk on water   -a man cannot heal the blind   -a man cannot gather 2 of every single species onto one giant boat he built himself   -a man cannot live inside a fish for three days   -a woman cannot not be a virgin and conceive a child      to me, the bible was just a book like any other book that just wanted to get a good message out.       Unfortunately the bible was blown way out of proportion and now has people convinced such stupid things are true, it blows my mind how people are actually convinced of such stupid things.      And now people are killing each other over it because of different interpretations.       Therefore I think the bible was simply another book with great intentions, that has been greatly misunderstood as real.      Does anyone else feel this way or thought of it in this way?

Should I do that or should I leave it just black and white with some writing   "When I'm without you, life is black and white"   My only concern is that ALL of the pictures on this canvas will be of me and him.

Lord Polonius (excerpt from Hamlet by William Shakespeare)      Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!   The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,   And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!   And these few precepts in thy memory   See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,   Nor any unproportioned thought his act.   Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.   Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,   Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;   But do not dull thy palm with entertainment   Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware   Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,   Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.   Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;   Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.   Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,   But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;   For the apparel oft proclaims the man,   And they in France of the best rank and station   Are of a most select and generous chief in that.   Neither a borrower nor a lender be;   For loan oft loses both itself and friend,   And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.   This above all: to thine ownself be true,   And it must follow, as the night the day,   Thou canst not then be false to any man.   Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

I'm aiming for the reader to get a general idea of where Adalina - the main character, comes from. What type of personality she has. Her background. It builds into mystery and suspense way down the road. I'm thinking of bringing some suspense and mystery into the picture with a change of the first paragraph. But for the most part it will have to build. As for right now I'm trying to give the reader a since of who Adalina is. To build a connection with her. It's not the complete chapter. It's just a small fraction.      Also keep in mind that this is a rough draft. It's not flawless. I'm sure I will revise it a million times before I'm satisfied with it. I JUST finished it and wanted to know what people thought or what advice could be given.          I felt slight butterflies while I applied lip gloss standing at the mirror of my closet door. “I know I’m not getting nervous”, I thought to myself. But I was. How could I possibly be getting nervous? I had been anticipating this moment for four years. I even had my walk planned out in my head like a how to impress manual. As soon as I heard the Dean say, “Adalina Jacobs”, I would glide across stage with such elegance and poise that the crowd would be in awe. Oh the crowd! I had just remembered how many people would be there. Eight hundred – twenty students graduating, most of whom I would imagine had their entire family attending. The average family is made of four people. If each graduate had their brother or sister, mother, and father attending. That would mean two thousand – four hundred sixty people, or should I say pairs of eyes, staring at me. If their aunts, uncles, grandmas, and grandpas come that means – ugh. I felt the butterflies getting stronger. This was a terrible time to have a ninety -five average in college algebra.      I started focusing on my smile to calm the nerves. Since I basically grew up in pageants, I knew how to flaunt the pearly whites perfectly. I practiced it in the mirror a couple times. Nodding to myself at the ones I liked the most. I wanted my smile to be charming and show confidence. I didn’t want to flash too much, therefore I thought just showing the top row was acceptable. I thought it would look too stiff and staged if I showed all my teeth. I imagined my competitors in the pageants who would stand and hold that deranged smile. Thank god I never did that. My smile always looked flawless and natural. I hoped I was still able to display “the perfect smile”. How hard it was to capture “the perfect smile” had escaped me until now. Once the muscles get comfortable moving a certain way, it’s hard to steer them in another direction. After a few tries it came back to me like a forgotten mathematical formula. But it was very uncomfortable to hold. Good thing I’d only have to hold it for a few seconds going across stage. Of course the one I like the most would be uncomfortable. Suddenly my mind rose out of its immunity. Why am I so worried about a smile? I should just relax and try to enjoy the occasion. I took a deep breath and exhaled. As I continued to get ready I repeated in my head, “Just don’t give a fake smile”. The fake smile is passable as a child, but as a twenty-two year old honor graduate, I believed it would tarnish my presence.      There’s goes those butterflies again. My preparations seem to be making me more nervous. AT this point no one would believe that I once stood, fearlessly, in the spotlight. For some reason it was easier then. I guess because I loved the attention then. Being stared at gave me a reason to stare at others, which was something my mother told me wasn’t polite to do. As I placed my eyeliner on with the perfect form, pinky closest to the ear - pencil closest to the nose, I flashed back to the competition days. I looked at my one can of hairspray, a small traveler’s bag of makeup, and a few outfits hanging in the closet. I abruptly realized how much of a down size my amenities had taken over the years. I’m not sour though. I’m glad those days are over. Stand like this, move like that, tons of direction and no freedom. I remember mother’s screaming at their children to nail choreography flawlessly. Although they spoke with kindness in their voice, behind clinching teeth, I still viewed them as screaming. The children would be crying pleading with their mother’s to allow permission to stop.      Wonder where those kids are now? With such mental weight I’m sure it didn’t lead them down a positive road. Good thing my mother wasn’t like that. With me being the only Mexican kid there, you could easily envision her going harder on me than any other parent. Surprisingly, she didn't. I think I took it a lot more seriously than she did. In my young eyes everything had to be perfect. My outfit, my dance routine, even my terrible chipmunk sounding voice had to be perfectly intact. “It feels good to no longer be such a perfectionist”, crossed my mind as I dabbed away the mistakes in my

20090202232417AAvgcHh	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Your opinion on this poem ?	Broken Angel      Tied to a stone - my legs,   Pull me down into a void,   Of gloom, despair and oblivion,   As my inculpable soul died.      There was a time when my smile,   Penetrated even the night sky,   Evicted the darkness with dazzling light,   And with my wings i soared high.      Like an angel, beautiful and chaste,   Who could strike delight,   In hearts of those it touched and,   Welcomed them to share its might.      I used to be happy once,   Capable of emotions, capable of love.   I could find pleasure in small things,   Lived my life gaily and with verve.      When I wept - on my scenic face;   So beautiful, almost an illusion -   A thousand dreams lay shattered,   Melancholy devouring the pain.      Nobody cares anymore, nobody sees,   Because I am a broken angel.   My wings no longer fly gracefully,   Cutting through the sky, they tremble.      The clouds don't catch me anymore,   But they find me sprawled on the ground,   And sing foolish lyrics into my ears,   A requiem, whispered without a sound.      And they lift me high up to the stars,   Only to send me plummeting down,   Ripping my torn, ragged, bleeding heart,   As the stone pulls me until I drown.

Our modern-day, quasi-socialist government has little in common with the constitution and vision of our nation's forefathers who shed their blood so we can be free. While a large part of our nation has been overcome, the last, intact segment of original Constitutional thought--where the battle of freedom and liberty is presently being fought--is in the South!  The one place still possessing a moral fiber.      So I ask, will the south rise again?  I'm trying to be sincere about this without stepping on any toes.  I know a lot of you folk are northern and think the previous rise in the south was over slavery (which it it wasn't) .. but if ya'll could, please refrain from giving me a cruel answer.

(by (me) Victoria Tarrani (c) 09.01.29)       Liar, lies, deceitful he is   I was blinded by love,   but he lost sight    of the joy that filled his life.      Used, abused, abandoned   when another came along.      He stays    to haunt me   in sardonic ways.   He shows   me his new target.      My pain is staggering   yet I know so well   what happened to me    will happen to her.      She shared her body,   I gave my heart.   Souls do not intertwine   when the words of love    are only those of lust.      Even in sorrow   I am free, he is trapped.      Knowing him   brings longing lust.   When I take   only pleasure,   he will fall in love   with me..         My heart    is still too fragile   to give again.

All through my life I have had your undying devotion, your ever strengthening shoulders so undauntedly bearing the burdens of your life, while all the time lifting me up above the floods that I had let loose. Selflessly wanting only happiness in all those that you've encountered.  I am taken back to my childhood one which many, even yourself have seen?  Parents torn apart, life stops, yet only for a second.  For you were always moving, always climbing for us, never for yourself.  I hope you realize just how much you have saved me from things I did not understand.  Never looking down upon me, never letting me forget just who I am.  Mom I truly hope that I will be all the man, all the human you prepared me to be.        I love you,      Your son

20090203014435AA53gP4	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Beyond Good And Evil: Where does Right Go Wrong?	Everyone's definition of good is unique, and is sometimes contradictory to another man's definition of good.  It is perhaps true that everyone is evil to at least some percentage of people.       At what point does one good not press against the good of another?      At what point are we able to judge another man's good as our evil, and furthermore, use force to correct them?         To Christians:      I realize the obvious notion that God is one who decides, who has given us His word, which is what one can base knowledge of good/evil on.     Please only bring up philosophical ideas, how do you define good/evil without a manual.
