Was the housing crisis was the cause of the collapse of the economy? Can we agree that we fired a bunch of idiots on the left and right?      I have a ton of questions, maybe I should make a sep question for each??? Either way please answer as many as you can THNAKS         What does this Bill have to do with fixing the underline cause of the problem?      I mean if they are really trying to fix the problem and not pass the pork and grow government then why are they throwing money around like it grows on trees?       Then we have our wonderful President out there saying a catastrophe is looming and any day the world is about to end if we don’t pass the pork to everyone down the line.       What is doing on?       I feel like I live in cartoon land      Why not go and fix Fannie and Freddie or better yet shut them down 100% and start over?      Why not let the banks and the too bigs to fail fail? That will cause a huge opportunity for people like me on the bottom to start up something huge, I could start a business and start hiring people cause they will want to lend money left and right to encourage people to get back in the game of the American Dream.       Is this America or some third world country??       Can we all just at least agree we have hired a bunch of ding dongs on both sides of the isle?

20090205084540AA3Jyzu	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Questions about refusing a father access to my house (i watch is children)?	Ok, so my sister and her soon to be ex husband are getting separated.  She was a stay at home mom and now has to work.  While I'm a stay at home mom myself i've offered to watch the children for her because childcare is outrageously expensive in this area and i just plain ol' don't like putting children in daycare if you can help it.  ANYway, a few weeks ago her husband was literally ripping the kids from her arms and couldn't answer when he'd be back with the kids. My sister, hysterical and crying her eyes out, yelled for me to come help (we share one big house separated into two with one door in the middle joining both sides). So, her husband and i got into a shouting match and he shoved me into the wall (police officer said i couldn't press charges because i put myself in the middle of the situation).  I'm not comfortable with him being ANYWHERE near my kids.  Anyway, back to the question. My sis and her husband are on pretty nasty terms right now and he told her that he was coming to the house tomorrow to pick up the girls while i am watching them and said that if i don't let him in it would be considered kidnapping.  I hate that i have to hand these kids over to this pathetic excuse of a man, but I can't legally *refuse* him his children.  Can I, however, refuse him unless he has an escort?  I WILL NOT open my door to him as I feel he is a threat to myself and my children.  Can he press charges for me not opening my door if he shows up alone?

He has hired a bunch of Republicans in his cabinet, and Democrats who are so conservative they might as well be Republicans, he has hired people that implemented Bush policies ranging from war making to overseeing the economy and financial markets...he has even hired a guy to run the commerce department who was advocating not so long ago to abolish the commerce department.      Now we hear he is planning to create a white house faith based office....to continue Bush's move in that direction.      So my question is this......what all these blatant attempts to pacify conservatives/republicans make more of them vote for Democrats and Obama in the next couple elections?      Why did we elect a Democrat if we are going to have so much Republican ideology staying the course??  Remember the motto CHANGE that was such a big part of what the voters for Obama wanted?

Greenwood's bill, which has yet to be numbered, is modeled after an amendment introduced just days before the end of the 2008 legislative session. That proposal by former Rep. Glenn Donnelson never received a public hearing or a vote.       "I'm sponsoring this bill not only to make sure that those who are receiving this are not committing a felony, but also to help make those students who are undocumented aware they are committing a felony by working using fraudulent documents," Greenwood said.       Critics, though, say the bill unfairly targets undocumented students from lower-income families.       "This is only for people who are young and trying to better themselves," said Philip Bernal, a member of The Utah Hispanic/Latino Legislative Task Force. "It's saying 'If you want to get an education, you can't work to get an education like everyone else does.' "       He also says it's not the students committing a crime, but rather a company who    hires an undocumented worker.  http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_11621643

20090205090236AAvXWuv	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think that Obama knows anything about economics?	I started listening to Obama's audio book "the audacity of Hope", just to get some idea of what he is thinking, and in the introduction he states that during the Bush years the Democrats watched as the Republicans gave huge tax breaks to big business, which in his words "stuck it to the working man". Can some one explain to me how letting companies keep their own money instead of the government taking it, actually "sticks it to the working man"? I would think that at worse it wouldn't affect the working man at all, and I see the potential for many possible benefits. Perhaps the company can give raises or bonuses to the workers with the tax breaks, maybe health care benefits, vacation time to the workers, maybe be able to expand their business and employ more workers with the tax cuts.
20090205085559AAfpnVf	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What do they mean by "separation of church and state?"?	Does this mean the church should stay out of the government, or that the government should stay out of the church?      Thomas Jefferson first used the phrase when he was writing to a group of Baptists.  He reminded them that the American people decided that "[The] legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church & State."  (He was quoting the Constitution).      By preventing the government from making a state/national religion it sounds to me like they don't want the government getting involved with religion, not the other way around.      The writers of the Declaration of Independence included references to God, a "Creator," and "the Supreme Judge of the world."  Obviously at least some of them were religious people, did they want to make sure their religious belief couldn't be involved in the new government?      Have we been interpreting it backwards this whole time?

20090205090153AASQqVR	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My car was damaged in my ex-husband's poorly maintained driveway - can I sue?	This one is a little complicated...         It's not so much a typical driveway as a driveway EASEMENT. The "driveway" is a private lane where 5 homeowners all use it to get access to their own houses.       The property line for my ex-husband's property and the neighbor across this lane goes straight down the middle (I used to co-own the house with him, so I know this is the case). This driveway easement is not considered a legal "road" in any way ... so it's not the township that has any responsibility for maintaining this road or anything that happens on it... again, I lived there for 3 years, so I am well acquainted with the details of this neighborhood.      Several months ago, all the neighbors got together and chipped in for a retrofit hard rubber speed bump that is installed with a couple of carriage bolts sunk into the asphalt. This speed bump is located in the section of this driveway easement where one half of the street is owned by my ex-husband and the other half is owned by the neighbors across the lane. One bolt is improperly installed and has worked its way out of the asphalt... and is sticking up out of this speed bump by approx. 2 inches.       I was picking up my kids from my ex-husband's house after school yesterday ( I had total permission and authorization from him to drive into the driveway to get the kids at that time)... and while driving over this speed bump and trying to avoid the bolt from puncturing my tire, instead, it ripped my front exhaust pipe clean apart and now it's going to cost a couple of hundred bucks to get it replaced and installed, etc. My car is a small coupe and rides somewhat low to the ground... I've had a mechanic verify this was the case that caused this damage.      I don't want to soak anyone - just get reimbursed for my cost to have the new pipe purchased and installed by a mechanic. I have extensive photos, measurements, and documentation to prove it was this poorly maintained homeowner installed speedbump that cause the damage to my car.      Would their homeowner's insurance cover this cost? (I have liability on my car so my insurance won't do anything) ... should I go to an attorney - would legal fees exceed the 200 bucks for me to get my front exhaust pipe replaced?      Who do I sue? Both my ex- and his neighbor?... If I can prove the offending bolt is in the NEIGHBOR'S half of the driveway easement ... do I sue the neighbor and leave my ex-husband out of it? How do I make a claim against their homeowner's insurance? Or do I only have the option to ask for their private reimbursement .. and if they decline to do it out of court - than do I file a lawsuit ... then THEY would have th option to file a claim with their homeowner's insurance?      Ugh ... this is such a mess.....

With the election of President Obama came a new found respect to america from across the world including Great Britain. Many britains are certain this could mean a strengthing of relations which while remain solid, have decresed over past 5-10 years with what many britains are seeing as an unequal relationship, a relationship that should be kept at arms length.      However the election of president obama has changed this, i feel the uk is very optimistic, although maybe a little cautiously that this wil be the beginning of a new era      ,However there have been reports from US officials that the us/uk relationship may be sidelined for the sake or new relaionships.      It has been reported that obama will intead focus on strengthing relations with the muslim world, and countries such as france and germany, britain, usa`s staunch ally for many years may be cast aside.      Many brits may feel threatened and angered by this, what are your views of this (on both sides of the pond) and what to see happenig to the US/UK special? relationship.      Also has the recent news of obamas protectionist policies and the threats from his administration to the uk for demanding Guantanamo torture details already made many brits start to doubt if obama will change anything to the relations of these two nations.

There is no God who condones taking the life of an innocent human being," and all religions teach people to love and care for one another.       That describes Islam in a nutshell.  Yeah Right.

Geithner, Killerfer, Blago, Wright, Ayers, Richardson, and Dacshle...now add the name of Peneta to the Culture of Corruption.   Leon Peneta, nominated to preside over the demise of the CIA (hence no need to actually know how to run it) has had his finances for last year exposed.   Its reported that he took over $700,000 in "consulting fees" and "speaking fees" from very influential big businesses involved in government and financial influence peddling. These include Neman Marcus , Bof A, and Wahcovia. Clearly, threes an opportunity for these influential companies to exert some amount of influence on Peneta, a White House insider, thus creating a very possible CONFLICT OF INTEREST between the government and regulated industries and bailout recipients.   What say You America?   Please opine anytime, anytime and keep it pithy in the No Spin Zone because we're looking out for the folks.

20090205093502AADPqWC	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did America blame Communism for the world's problems?	When I look at the course of the past 50-60 years, I see that Communism was always seen as a great threat to the world. I also saw that the USSR was always portrayed as the bad guys. However, the United States under a Capitalist dominated system was responsible for many atrocities: Nicaragua, Iran (1953), Vietnam, as well as many other 3rd world countries. Anyways, communism in its true form has never existed. The type of system seen in the USSR and (communist) nations was a form of state socialism. According to the principles of Marx, Democracy cannot survive in a stable mode without the eventual evolution to true Socialism nor can Socialism exist without Democracy. So why do you all think that Communism was seen as a culprit when it in fact never really existed?

20090205093415AAIKUiL	Politics & Government;Military	USMC - Marine MOS's and Question?	I know that a Marines first job is rifleman because every Marine needs to know how to fire a gun. My question is about the different jobs within the Marines.      If your a Marine and your Infantry obviously when your deployed you will be in combat at some point in time or another.      (Quote from a SSGT)   "If you are a cook in the Marines and you get deployed you will go to your deployment and cook, we would never put a cook with the infantry because we have the best infantry in the world and placing a cook with the Infantry would hurt our Infantry"   ( Basically saying a cook will never be in combat only the kitchen  )      That was an example they gave me because I was looking into joining. I wanted to do something with computers like communications or something within the Marines. I have met Infantry men in the Marines and they are tough "Mthfkers" I dont think I would have the balls to be in Infantry.       Would I still be thrown in combat even if my job was non-combat related? ( Im really good with computers so thats what i wanna do ) Or would there be the chance of being grouped with an Infantry division that may very well thow you in combat.       Joining the Marines would be really good for me but to experience putting a bullet through someone im sure is easier said than done. My problem is i dont know if i could do it. To protect myself yes but, you get the point.      I dont want random answers, i want to hear from someone with experience or knowledge of this type of question.

Once we have succeeded in the revolution, we continue to other weak countries and eventually the stronger ones at the end. The whole process would be democratic and certain people will be charge of certain geographic areas (but not in the sense that they are leaders of countries, as that would imply hierarchy). All people will be provided according to his or her need and work according to his or her skill or ability. Production would be based on demand, as in people would tell the economic planning department (these people being elected democratically) what they need (as in essential needs) and what they would like (within reasonable limits) and industries with the most demand would require more workers while other industries would require less. What do you think of this? It's good yeah?

Siendo este el comportamiento de muchos de los ciudadanos de nuestro país, los políticos actuarán acorde? (Robando, viendo por su propio bienestar, culpar a otros, etc).

20070301152357AAJlgWL	Politics & Government;Government	Do americans actually realize that our involvement in Iran from 1950's was a catalyst for Irans hatred for US?	In 1951, a pro-democratic nationalist, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh rose to prominence in Iran and was elected Prime Minister. As Prime Minister, Mossadegh alarmed the West by his nationalization of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later British Petroleum, BP) that had controlled the country's oil reserves. In response, Britain immediately embargoed Iran. Soon after, members of the British Intelligence Service invited the United States to join them in covertly overthrowing the democratically-elected Mossadegh. After convincing Eisenhower that Mossadegh was sympathetic to communism (even though he was an avowed anti-communist), the United States agreed to assist Britain in Operation Ajax. President Eisenhower authorized the CIA to take the lead in the operation of overthrowing Mossadegh and supporting a US-friendly monarch.  Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became increasingly autocratic.     Simple rule of Cause and Effect.

20081008193631AAZxdJz	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Marriages and Law:Infidelity should be a crime punishable by murder or 25 to life?	I think some people will go truly insane by this proposal but some people here will miss the point. You see when one of the married partner commits the act it cause great damage the other partner.       The damage is sometimes underestimated.It many cases it can kill the person via suicide,stress,permanent mental damage. And then we forget the great damage it causes to the children which in many times is permanent beyond repair.Many times these children will then resort to drugs to relive stress and anger. Some even become violent are pissed off at the world.      Some people will say that you can't judge morality but i disagree.You see if the penalty was harsh people would less likely commit the sin/crime.Like i said people will say that infidelity is moral sin and not a crime but i disagree and so does the evidence.      By making marital infidelity a crime with stiff punishment it will bring marriage divorce stats down.In turn we happier and safer society which means only good things. Oh sure don't get me wrong some people will still commit the act,just like people commit other crimes.My opinion tho is that we need to institute marital infidelity as serious crime due to the damage it does.      The other part participating in the crime would be punish (If married he would get the same punishment,if not he would get punished but not to the extent of the married partner.      This law only apply's to married people and not single people ie girlfriend/boyfriend cheating      The only way to convict would be to have absolute proof without a shadow of a doubt.Video/pictures/audio/witnesses/dat... ect      Another benefit of this law is that it would force people to think twice before you marry.Another benefit this would provide is the emotional damage caused to the other partner in a divorce. You see if people would divorce first and the have their fun the other partner would not be harmed.In effect what this does is that it makes the partner considering of affair to think twice.His/Her question will think if being with another person worth a divorce? People often times want to have their cake and it eat it and we need to eliminate that.      Now before you spit venom at me i am not married and have have never experienced this crime against me but i have witness it and have talked with many people about this,.      Obliviously cheaters will hate this idea (Are you really surprised?) but i would like to hear your opinions on this matter.

20090205112553AAb6XzP	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think more regulations could inadvertently lead to more corruption?	Extensive regulations tend to cost companies money. Therefore buying off regulators becomes a more tempting thing to do. Especially when the amount to buy off the regulator is less than the amount one would lose while doing business legally.      I'm not implying there should be no regulations at all. But as the Markopolis case points out: Just because you have lots of rules doesn't mean they're being enforced on everyone. The more rules you have, the more regulators you will have to keep track of as well.      .....................................      Apparently the SEC was more than capable of enforcing the laws, but because they were "in bed" with Wall Street no one did.      Harry Markopolis tried to warn SEC for NINE YEARS of Bernard Madoff Ponzi Scheme.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwUH9iA0G...  (portion of congressional testimony)      The whistleblower who detected the alleged Bernard Madoff fraud nine years ago yesterday subjected the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to a devastating public attack.      Testifying to Congress, Harry Markopolos accused the US regulator of being scared of confronting big Wall Street investors and of being crippled by internal squabbling and incompetence. Mr Markopolos said that many banks and funds on Wall Street knew about Mr Madoff’s fraud before it was exposed but “those in glass houses don’t throw stones”.       http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/bu...

WASHINGTON -- The White House's nominee for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Leon Panetta, has earned more than $700,000 in speaking and consulting fees since the beginning of 2008, with some of the payments coming from troubled financial firms and from a firm that invests in contractors for federal national security agencies, according to financial disclosures released Wednesday.    Mr. Panetta received $56,000 from Merrill Lynch & Co. for two speeches and $28,000 for a speech for Wachovia Corp., according to disclosures released ahead of Thursday's scheduled Senate hearing on Mr. Panetta's nomination.    Both Merrill and Wachovia reported big losses last year and were acquired by larger firms. The Wachovia honorarium was dated Oct. 30, and the last Merrill Lynch honorarium was dated Oct. 11, according to disclosure forms filed by Mr. Panetta in connection with his nomination. At the time, Bank of America had agreed to a rescue of Merrill Lynch; Wachovia had agreed to be acquired by Wells Fargo & Co.    All of the companies listed took bailout money.

Over to the East the good people of Stalingrad were fighting tooth and nail against one of the most advanced and fearless army of darkness the world has ever seen, resulting in 95% of Stalingrad destroyed and millions of Russians dead.      But yet in the end who won? The people who had suffered the most? surely history has shown that suffering is temporary on this earth.      Do you think the parallels in Gaza are the same? The Israeli navy on the high seas has all but strangled Gaza, yet arms and other supplies from Iran are still getting through a bit like when America was supplying the British in WW2 and avoiding the Nazi "kreigsmarine"?      That Gaza and its people have been cut to smithereens by the might of the Israeli Luftwaffe yet remain unbowed like the Brave British people did some 60 years ago?

20090205104213AAebzhN	Politics & Government;Politics	Now that CONGRESS has passed their no bank left behind program. do you think it's right that they?	replace their workers with foreign workers. they applied for 22,000 H-1B visas. the average pay is $90.700.00 according to an AP study.   these jobs are for vp's and ppl to work in human resources and more. seems to me this is mighty strange that we don't have this talent in this country. I did say congress and not the Presidents. I think there are a lot of Americans that could use those jobs to help bring the economy back up. right now we are bringing in 85,000 ppl a year under the H-1B visa program and I think it might be a good idea to stop or at least suspend the program until we get back to normal again. what do you think.

I do not care if you are a private citizen or the Government. I used to be in the KILL EM ALL camp, but now I believe there is a better way.      If you are convicted of a heinous crime I.E. Rape, murder, child predator, you get one appeal, then you are sent off to the tundra prison in Alaska. You get a 4x8 cell 3 squares a day, you get a shower once every three days, you get five minutes of yard time every day. You also get one ten minute visit from ONE prearranged visitor, through a glass barrier ONCE A YEAR. Most importantly, you get life in prison with no possibility of anything other than what was outlined above.      YOU DO NOT GET ...free cable, free newspaper, free magazines, free use of the computers, library, no smoking, no drugs, and no FREE WILLY.      This would serve as a greater deterrent than the death penalty ever could.      If you namby pamby ACLU types don't like it you can kiss my red white and blue A$$!      I WANT MY COUNTRY BACK!

I didn't apply for it, they just evaluated my injury and came up with a percentage. I said that I didn't want a handout and they told me they had to give me something for "vulnerability to lawsuit reasons". They said it wasn't a handout program but a compensation program, just like when you get injured in a car accident. I still work and am about to go to college. It would be hard without the money though. I've already lost two jobs and missed out on a promotion because of my disability. Not saying I was discriminated against. Just couldn't preform like others could, that's why I want to go to college and compete in an intellectual way. I can't help but feel guilty though, what do you think      P.S.

20090205105231AAJYyTq	Politics & Government;Government	Is there another way besides "this" to cut our national deficit?	At a press conference today by Wall Street mogul Peter Peterson, he and his invited speakers informed Americans who are losing their jobs and homes in record numbers that our nation’s biggest problem is the national deficit—and that the solution is to cut Social Security and Medicare.  Now that the bubble has burst and the economy has collapsed, not only does Peterson give support to those who want to water down the recovery investments, he comes to D.C. to present a set of solutions that completely ignore how we got here and would place an enormous burden on the middle class and the poor. He wants Congress and President Obama to agree to a commission to slash Social Security and Medicare—which he calls "entitlements"—and undoubtedly to cut other important social spending.   How on earth does this presumptuous man have the nerve to say Social Security and Medicare are entitlements!

20090205103125AAIjoaW	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should we bother with an opening, case and closing?	My fiance is going to court in April for a custody case for his daughter. His case is likely to turn into a request for an order for a paternity test if his ex won't cooperate. Neither of them are bringing attorneys so I wondered if he should bother writing an opening to introduce the bones of his case since he goes first anyway as the plaintiff. I know he'll need to have the meat of his case written out when he presents it, but will he also need a closing? He isn't planning on taking any witnesses and we know that his ex won't have written an opening or closing, if she even prepares a defense beyond "well he ain't been around my baby so he ain't my baby daddy" (literally that's what she would say...) I read up on the particular preferences of the judge and he likes courtesy and preparation. So I would assume that it would go a long way with this judge for my fiance to introduce his case in a formal opening, then proceed with his reasons for wanting custody, the best interests of the child, and his evidence stating why he believes the child is his and why the advantages of a relationship with him will greatly outweigh the negative effects likely to be caused by such a change in her life. Then the mother will go and I thought he should have a formal closing and then a rebuttal (although I can't really help him write the rebuttal) Do you think that all the extra work would pay off or would it be a waste and the judge will tell him just get to the case?

20090205102725AAmywOL	Politics & Government;Government	911 and the plane that hit the pentagon?	We all know 911 very well but my question is about the plane that hit the pentagon. Conspiracy therorists say a missle, not a plane, hit the pentagon. Normally we should just believe the story that a plane hit it, but I have a few questions.      1. Media has no problem showing 2 planes hitting the twin towers. This did occur. But they act all supcious and won't give ANY information about the plane hitting the pentagon? Why is this?       2. Why show only a 5 frame video of the plane hitting the pentagon when clearly no plane is visable. Do they think were stupid or something?      3. Why was there a line of guys in the yard as if they was looking for "scraps" from the plane. In a time of crisis, the last thing to do is say "okay, pentagons on fire, lets do some yard work boys"? No one was certiantly picking up "scraps" from the towers before they colasped.      4. Why is there just simpley no evidence of a plane? And why are they not showing plane parts? There was 1 huge moving object that they was getting out of the pentagon covered in a blue sheet, but thats a good question one should ask himself. Why is it covered up in a sheet? Why was the sheet never uncovered so we could see what was behind it?       I think if a plane did hit the pentagon, atleast HALF of it would be intact at the back end after the collision.      None of this adds up to a plane hitting it and showing no video, with the idea that guys are hiding objects and picking up scraps before worker crews get there.       Also, this is a bit offtopic but when the "insider job" kids went to see Bill Clinton and told him it was a inside job, he told them "hey, you was rude to me, not let me speak..   how dare you, how dare you".       One thing that I just noticed that seem strange was the fact that Clinton had no vindictive spirit. He said the words but the fact didn't match his patriotism. Almost as if he was so bland in defending the idea that american didn't attack his own people.       I mean if its true, we got attacked and it wasn't the government, I would atleast have a stronger convinction and say "hell no", rather than how dare you, so bland.

Everyone's painting a very bleak picture of America. VERY bleak. Basically saying that our country as we knew it is over, and it's going to sink into horrible conditions from here on in, if we don't make some changes and get help PRONTO, such as the $900 billion stimulus bill.      Well, my first question is, according to the polls why are 52% of Americans AGAINST this bill? Is there another way to fix our economy without it, or are they just welcoming the destruction and want to see it all fail?       Not sure what they're thinking?      Also, even if we do get it passed...will this recession still linger forever and ever and ever?      Are our hard times here to stay indefinitely, and we should expect hardships, attitudes, road rage driving, drug use, greed, and all other evils, to linger on indefinitely?         How much more can we take, mentally that is?      I mean how many years upon years can you live in "hard times" before you finally snap?         Is America going to become a country people WANT to leave?      I think it's already getting there, and I'm getting scared, and I personally feel like I want to bail on America, if things are going to get so bad.      I mean I even observe the way people are out there, how they act, etc,..and many people have become so hardened, cut-throat, former shells of themselves, ..they just seem to be turned cold and hopeless.         I don't want to live in this type of an environment, and who in their right mind would want their children to go through this?      The America that we've inherited and grew up in, at least in my generation, (I'm 27) SUCKS. We have kids in their early teens doing drugs/alcohol and sex already.         It's pretty bleak, unless you're a millionaire and above, and that's no way to live.      What kind of life is, going paycheck to paycheck, worrying all the time, and that's that?      That's not living.      It's like a slow, torturous mentally excruciating death.

Obama is claiming that Congress is too slow and basically, how dare they change the stimulus legislation he worked on.  He made statements that it was solely the Congress's fault we are in this horrible economy (failing to put any blame on the war in Iraq).  But he was part of that Congress...      So I was curious why he thought he was so much better and wiser than the 535 congress men and women.      I can only find that in his 3 years as a Senator, he sponsored 136 bills and only 2 have become law.  He drafted none.

My current job puts me through a lot of training concerning physical security, and I was wondering if this training could pay off someday. I know companies pay hackers to break into their systmes to find and repair security flaws, but do companies pay people to find the flaws in their physical security? Examples would be seeing how one could get past airport security and/or rent-a-cops in office buildings, even seeing what can be gotten past MPs at military installations and other secure US compounds. If such companies exist, does anyone have a link to their websites?  By this I dont mean robbing places in the middle of the day, when something could go wrong with bystanders,  i mean coming in at night and getting past their security, and telling them how i did it.  Not actually robbing a place, just telling them how it could be done, so that they could fix the loop holes.

20090205110055AAaUeJk	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do you think poor people should have children?	I know a woman who has worked hard all of her life but has always lived paycheck to paycheck. She doesn't have any insurance because her job doesn't offer it and her husband can't work because he is disabled (paraplegic), but he does collect disability. They have been married for 7 years and she wants kids so bad but they have never been able to have any.  She is a wonderful woman, age 35, awesome with kids, and her husband is great with them as well. She is fairly well educated, mainly through personal studies, but she has gone to college as well, but did not graduate because she has narcolepsy and it made it hard for her to keep on going, because she had to work at the same time, although she did very well while she went. She and her husband help out others in her community with other children and have helped many of the other children to go to college and and the like. She just loves kids and wants one of her own so bad, but they just cannot afford health insurance for her let alone fertility treatment. She was almost in tears when we talked about it. When I talked to her, she admitted to me that if she ever did get lucky and have a child, they would probably need government assistance to afford the child though. I just felt so sorry for this woman. Even though her and her husband would need assistance from the government if they did have a child, I already know that she would be a better mother to the child than I have seen personally with people who do have alot of money.       So my question is, in a situation like this, do you think she should have a child or get assistance to have a child or do you think that because they are poor that they should suffer the cruel punishment of never experiencing having offspring?

If they do that - it means the stock goes up and the CEO gets rewarded.      This works against the greater good.   It gives CEO's incentives to pursue pursue business models that treat workers poorly.    We should reverse this through regulation and make it imperative that every CEO pursue job creation....and better treatment for their workers.      Why don't we force incentives into CEO pay......so, so it would be something like this:      A base of $100,000 (enough to live on comfortably in most places).   + the average of all salaries+benefits across their company   + 1% of the salary for every job created   - 1% of every job lost (but the CEO would make at least $50,000 no matter what)

How can the USA support the Sri Lankan Government, who have been proven to have conducted human rights abuse?   I understand that they are fighting the LTTE, who are classed as a terrorist organisation, but surely it i not morally right to support human rights abuse?      Also, the US has supported claims by the Sri Lankan Government that the LTTE are the ones killing innocent civilians. How can this be when there are multiple videos of the Tamils being killed? (Footage was shown on the BBC about 3 days ago).      Facts also suggest otherwise. Fighting is going on in the North, where Tamils primarily live. They may not always be killed intentionally by the Government but they are killed nonetheless.   Also, Tamil civilian deaths are disproportionately high, and surely the deaths would not be caused by those who are fighting for them?      I fail to see how any of the world's most powerful Governments (the US is not alone, Pakistan, India and China have also been involved), can honestly support such actions for any reason other than the fear or being labeled as terrorism sympathisers?

20090219111407AAxfLGw	Politics & Government;Politics	A question for Obama supporters, McCain supporters, Democrats, and Republicans?	I'm a libertarian. Normally I don't try to ask questions that might attract hostility, but I felt this one was worth it.      The two groups within the two major parties that I have the biggest problem with, are the social liberals and the social conservatives. Both groups believe in forcing people to do want they believe should be done in society.       A different user ask a question yesterday that got my attention. They asked who a persons greatest enemy is, and who is the only person standing in our way for success. Everyone said that the answer to both questions was yourself. So we are the only ones standing in the way of our success.       That made me think about these two groups and wonder why they are always looking for others to force into doing what they think should be done in society. Social liberals want to force equality through redistribution of everything, and social conservatives want to force morality by regulating peoples personal lives. If everything you believed became law, it still wouldn't change anything. If enough people disagree with you then your beliefs being law wouldn't change anything.       History shows that something being law doesn't stop people, and especially americans, from rising up and overthrowing that law if enough people disagree with it, even if they're the minority. So given that your beliefs becoming law wouldn't necessarily change anything why do you try to force people to do what you want done in society instead of just doing it in the private world instead of through government. Such as being the example.

20090203032115AAyCsnC	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	No Win No Fee Lawyers?	Myself and my partner went to see a lawyer today about unlawful dismissal, after looking through everything the lawyer said that he would take the case and filled out the paperwork to lodge for the claim, after this he said he would appear for us at a conciliation meeting with the employer, after enquiring about the fees he said that it was between 750 and 1000 dollars, but he would do it on a no win no fee basis for us.   My main question is, when they offer this (as this was a small lawyers office, no advertising about this at all) does it mean that they pretty much know they will win the case and get there fee?
