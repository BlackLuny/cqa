20090309120604AAsIjCb	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Why do some people continue to say that the Arabs "fled Palestine" at the urging of their leaders when...?	...when there is no proof to support that and in fact there is proof to contradict it?      Even the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, which describes the history and formation of Israel ( http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/history/histor...  , doesn't mention anything about Arab's willingly leaving to allow their leaders to attack  - you would think that if anyone would say this, it would be the Israel website.      There is even an Israeli writer, Peretz Kidron, who acknowledges that this rumor was a falsehood created by Israel: "Israeli propaganda has largely relinquished the claim that the Palestinian exodus of 1948 was 'self-inspired'. Official circles implicitly concede that the Arab population fled as a result of Israeli action - whether directly, as in the case of Lydda and Ramleh, or indirectly, due to the panic that and similar actions (the Deir Yassin massacre) inspired in Arab population centers throughout Palestine. However, even though the historical record has been grudgingly set straight, the Israeli establishment still refused to accept moral or political responsibility for the refugee problem it- or its predecessors - actively created."      As for proof that it didn't happen:   "The BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) monitored all Middle Eastern broadcasts throughout 1948. The records, and companion ones by a United States monitoring unit, can be seen at the British Museum. There was not a single order or appeal, or suggestion about evacuation from Palestine, from any Arab radio station, inside or outside Palestine, in 1948. There is a repeated monitored record of Arab appeals, even flat orders, to the civilians of Palestine to stay put." Erskine Childers, British researcher, quoted in Sami Hadawi, "Bitter Harvest."       http://www.wrmea.com/jews_for_justice/st...

20090227151935AA8KJtu	Travel;United States;Detroit	Why do most people in Michigan think health care is a stable industry for a career?	Every factory worker that has been laid off says they will go back to school and become a medical assistant or nurse. Even worse, these people actually do get hired.      But for how much longer? When the inevitable cutbacks come to this delusional industry that bankrupts people for routine visits, all these people can kiss their jobs goodbye. If you think American health care can never be as slow, bad and inefficient as you claim Canada and Europe's are, think again. They've been fiscally responsible; we haven't.      When hospitals are forced to make the inevitable cutbacks, you will see the economy turn for the worse. I just wish more people would realize this before it's too late, but then again, the government probably already does. They just don't want to let people on to it yet, but it's inevitable.      What a shame, that people in this state are so stupid. You can't all leave your jobs in factories and work in hospitals. It doesn't work, economically. Delphi, GM and Ford bring outside money into Michigan, hospitals don't!

However, I cannot see why it should be forbidden, as my Airline company does not state it under items which cannot be brought as luggage.       I would be very appreciative of any help.

My friend and me, we're both 15, we want to go to California for a week (Spring break) we were planning on going alone but our parents are worried about us. However, we wouldn't be completely alone as my friend's uncle has a house and an apartment in Los Angeles that he is willing to let us stay in.       Our parents know that we're really responsible, no drinking or drugs etc. we do well in school too.       We already figured out the cost and it isn't expensive I can even pay for it with my own money.       We really would only be leaving to go shopping etc. because the house has a pool, so its not like we're going to sketchy places.       Do you have any suggestions on how we can convince our parents to let us go?

20090309143736AAURML1	Travel;United States;New York City	Question about moving to brooklyn?	I have always wanted to live in NYC, specifically Brooklyn. I've been there a few times and I know this is the place for me. I plan to move there at the end of August of this year. I just graduated with a bachelor's degree in nursing and I'm currently working in a medium-sized city in upstate NY as an RN, so I know finding a job will not be an issue. I'm also 23, single, and have no children. I also have family there and they said I could live with them as long as I want. Only thing is, my family in Brooklyn said that I need to know the truth and reality about the city and that it's really cutthroat and I might not make it there, they said I've been sheltered and protected my whole life and moving to Brooklyn might be too much for me. I'm really insulted by this, I consider myself to be an intelligent person and I don't plan on making any stupid decisions or intentionally putting my self in danger. I know how to not act like a tourist and millions of people move there all the time and make out just fine. I'm upset that my family is not being supportive of me. Why would they say this?

Its really nice but from time to it gets a little boring and you just want to escape. So for spring break me and my friends wanted to do something fun but we didnt want to be stuck here. Every year we end up staying here. Even though we have fun, it would still be nice to change it up. A few weeks ago some friends invited us to go down to Panama City for SB. Of course I asked my mom and she said no because she is really strict and requires adult supervision at all times( but i dont blame her). So instead me and my friends were thinking that one day out of SB we should just save up our money and drive out of town somewhere for the day and hang out. I was thinking Savannah because its really close, they have nice beaches, and it will only be during the day time. What are your opinoins? do u think this is a good idea? where are some other fun, close places in georgia?

20090309160052AAWkrcX	Travel;Ireland;Other - Ireland	What is life like in Ireland?	First off, I'm Irish-American, which means all I am is Irish, which is VERY rare in America but I've dated back to both sides of my family and that is that. I've been in love with my heritage since I was a little girl and have always wanted to live in Ireland. Don't get me wrong, America is a proud country since the Revolutionary War but I'm sick and tired of the racism, prejudice, all of that. I've seen many pictures of Ireland and am in love with it already.      I have a few questions. First, how would the people (men and women) treat an American in general?       Second, what is the differences from living in the country compared to the city, Dublin for example. I would also like to live in South Ireland, what are some beautiful places to live?      What are the school systems like? I plan on becoming a teacher; maybe at a Catholic school.       I'm also Roman Catholic, is there a difference between the way an Irish-Catholic chuch is and an American-Catholic church?       This next question may be a little brash, but with the Catholic faith, it is said no sex before marriage. Or anything to abide by in the Catholic faith, are the Irish people very strict about it?      And also, how would I be treated if I married someone Irish but I was American, how would I be accepted into their family?       And overall, from an Irish and American point of view (who travels to Ireland), do you enjoy living there instead of America?

20090309163049AA1w3jx	Travel;United Kingdom;London	Where is a good place to live in London after finishing uni?	Hey, I'm finishing my degree this year and moving to London to work but to be honest I'm a little scared about the whole thing. I love the center of London, but everytime I stay round a friends in the east end (White chapel, Stepney Green etc) I just think the whole residential area look really depressing and dull.   Can anyone who knows what they're actually talking about give me some pointers as to where the most fun places to live are? Of course I can't afford nice parts like the west (at least I'm assuming I can't).      Additional information on what most students do when they move to London would be useful. I was told Camden town was good?      Thanks for any information you can give guys, hopefully it will take some of my worries away.

20090309164159AADRsXT	Travel;Canada;Vancouver	What is the Hotel or Condo name that was in the news(?) a few years ago?	I know it has been awhile since I bet anyone has seen the news or read the paper of this hotel/condo in Vancouver, Canada. However I was wondering if anyone could tell the name of it.       On the news a woman or man, made previews of new hotels or condos coming in the year of 2007-2009. (I cannot remember the year). I remember some descriptions of a particular one I liked, but never caught the name of it. It had a spectacular view of the ocean-- if you got that room--like many hotels/condos. The bathroom was very cool. The bathtub was right there with no curtains or anything. Fortunately that didn't need to be a worry, since it was one way glass. The hotel I think--when you look at it--looked like it was made of glass, but you could never see what was on the inside. Unfortunately, that is all I remember, but I do know that the hotel was expensive--obviously--and had great view of the ocean, and sunset.

20090309171019AA5IBN3	Travel;United States;Chicago	Is the Red Line close to Little Village? (Chicago , IL)?	Okay, so I got accepted to Chicago High School for the Arts. (www.chiarts.org)   A new high school that is schedule to open this September.   The thing is that I have been waiting for almost six months for them to announce where it is going to be located. Their reason for not telling us is because the CPS doesn't allowed them to say it yet. Last month, it was noted in my acceptance letter that very soon they will let us know the location (which was 1,2,3....15 days ago and I haven't received anything yet.) Only thing they said is that its about 2 miles away from the loop (downtown,) and very close to the Red Line.    I haven't learned how to take the train, so I don't know how that works or where it is. I live on Little Village (Kedvale and 28th) and I'm wondering if anyone knows if the red line is far or close to here. How should I take it... ? Is it going to be hard... ? =/

I recently graduated from college and my family surprised me with a gift of $5000 plus a a plane ticket to where ever I would like to go. I always dreamed of living in another country for a year.

I speak fluent English, Spanish, French, Catalan, and Mandarin. But I would prefer a country that speaks English since it is my main language I use, and not Spanish since I grew up in a Spanish speaking country.      I spoke to someone who told me I could live very nicely in India for $5,000 for 6 months. They speak English there, too.      Any other suggestions?
