I know they may have something like use the bike rack at your own risk, but what if you were 100% sure it was secure and some punk cut the lock, would they assume liability by providing bike racks in the first place? this hasn't happened, I have a nice bike though and with the nice weather I was thinking about riding instead of driving to class.

20090307173846AAmiAIm	Politics & Government;Politics	Are you ready for socialized health care?	Heres what health care is like in Britain. Why on earth does Obama wanna do this?      Great Britain's National Health Service (NHS) was created on July 5, 1948. As with all government programs, bureaucrats underestimated initial cost projections. First-year operating costs of NHS were 52 million pounds higher than original estimates1 as Britons saturated the so-called free system.      Many decades of shortages, misery and suffering followed until 1989, when some market-based health care competition was reintroduced to the British citizens2.      Unfortunately for those requiring care, a mostly socialist health care system still has problems. The articles and commentaries in this section identify some disasters caused by government intervention in the British health care system.          * Only five out of 51 hospital trusts pass hygiene test, say inspectors         - Sarah Boseley, November 24, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]          * Heart patients dying due to poor hospital care, says report         - Sarah Boseley, June 8, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]          * NHS dentistry loses almost a million patients after new dentists' contract         - David Rose, June 6, 2008 [The Times]          * Private healthcare managers could be sent to turn round failing NHS hospitals         - Philip Webster, Political Editor, and David Rose, June 4, 2008 [The Times]          * Cancer patients ‘betrayed’ by NHS         - Sarah-Kate Templeton, June 1, 2008 [The Times]          * NHS scandal: dying cancer victim was forced to pay         - Sarah-Kate Templeton, June 1, 2008 [The Times]          * Pensioner, 76, forced to pull out own teeth after 12 NHS dentists refuse to treat her         - Olinka Koster, March 26, 2008 [Daily Mail(UK)]          * Dental patients face care lottery         - March 26, 2008 [Metro(UK)]          * Lung patients 'condemned to death as NHS withdraws their too expensive drugs'         - Jenny Hope, March 24, 2008 [Daily Mail(UK)]          * Women in labour turned away by maternity units         - John Carvel, March 21, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]          * Health inequality has got worse under Labour, says government report         - Andrew Sparrow, March 13, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]          * Angry GPs reluctantly accept plan for weekend and evening surgeries         - John Carvel, March 7, 2008 [Guardian Unlimited]          * NHS chiefs tell grandmother, 61, she's 'too old' for ￡5,000 life-saving heart surgery         - Chris Brooke, February 28, 2008 [Daily Mail(UK)]       http://www.liberty-page.com/issues/healt...

All im saying is....I mean im pissed off everytime i see a penny come out of my paycheck because those retards in washington dont know how to use it.    would you be willing to pay more taxes if the money was managed better and put to better use (well i guess maybe they wouldnt even need more taxes, because money would be used correctly)
20090307174306AAtIkge	Politics & Government;Politics	What proves this health care concern to be false?	Blunt, who will play a leading role in the debate, warned: "This could cause your employer to simply stop offering coverage, hoping the government will pick up the slack."      I think anyone with any sense sees this as the outcome of gov't health care.  Why would employers continue to fork out big bucks to pay medical coverage for their employees when they know they can get coverage from the gov't and it won't cost the business anything.  Even if slapped with a fine, they will still save money by letting the gov't foot the health care.      Why do people think workers in this country are going to turn their nose up to free care which they are paying for through taxes anyway?

We liked it but when we looked at it the water wasn't on. We asked the lady before we bought it why the water wasn't on and she said it will be turned on after we buy it and do the final walk through because it might leak so no big deal. We waited 1 week for her to have time to do a walk through. Still no water. When they did the walk through they said the water leaks outside so we have to get it repaired. Half ther responsibility half ours. 3 weeks later no water, no estimate for our "share", and we have no money to get it fixed on our own. We don't have any money for an attorney and they know it. We are trying to figure out how we are going to pay our rent on the first. The reason for the financial problem is cps got involved with me at my previous address because my 11 year old son fell asleep in class and they think he has a 2am bedtime everynight so to avoid him going into foster care my boyfriend quit his job.

20090307180244AAnTAqJ	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do you want to be stopped and searched?	This Wednesday I got on a train at 6:40am. I was on the train for 100 minutes and just before 8:30 i groggily left the train and got on my way.    As I was leaving the station i was apprehended by a community support officer and told that my bag would be searched under article 44 of the prevention from terrorism act. I took it off and put it on the floor, sensing that arguing was going to get me nowhere. I was asked whether i was carrying anything illegal and whether there was anything in the bag which could harm the officer while they searched it. I was told that the search being performed was random, and that i hadn't been picked out for any particular reason. I was asked to stand out of the way of people trying to leave the train station so that i didn't inconvenience them.      Apart from the obvious inconvenience and delay this caused to my journey, I felt extremely angry that i had been stopped like this, I'm not a terrorist, obviously, and i doubt that having their bag searched by a volunteer policeperson would prevent a genuine suicide bomber from killing anybody. I was told the search was random but looking around me there were no women being searched, only men, so in fact the random selection procedure is discriminatory, I don't suppose they actually know what they're looking for anyway- perhaps a clock with wires sticking out of it, who knows? I felt angry that my privacy was being invaded, that the activity seemed fruitless and that it wasn't even a real policeperson collaring me but a CSO.      The search having been finished i was asked for my name and address. I pulled out some ID and was told it was unneccesary.   "but i could give you any name i want"   "well, you could, but then you wouldn't have a record of the search to send to your MP"   "what good would writing to my MP do?"   "well, you could complain to them about it, you don't seem evry happy to be searched"   "Should i be happy about it?"   "well, you could tell your MP that, and we need your name and address to form the paper-trail"   "to be honest, i'd rather not be part of a paper trail"   "well, you don't HAVE to give me your name"      needless to say i didn't.      but i was thrown by her comment, that i didn't seem happy about the stop and search.   I suppose some people are proud to be searched in the ongoing fight to prevent terrorist attacks, but not me.      to my mind, if we can't afford to have bobbies on the beat, then why bother having idiots looking for nothing in particular, making you late for work, not learning anything about you and for goodness' sake, if i was carrying a bomb, why wouldn't i have it concealed under my coat, or in my pocket? and why would i wait til i was LEAVING a train station to set it off? I'd have done it somewhere IN the station surely? not in the taxi rank, or on my way past the  bus stop. i'd have done the train and probably tried to do it somewhere it would have delayed ALL the commuters.         so what do you think (if you're still reading) should we as citizens be in support of this massive waste of time and effort, or be surly and angry, late for work, and uncooperative when they ask for our names?

Lets be honest not many people like our government its been that way for a while, but i think obama sort have cleared that up but if he doesn't fix the economic problem he'll be thought of kinda like bush was....what do you think?

Pros and cons, add more if you can, debate some of the points listed (Am I wrong on some?), give me your thoughts. Here we go…         Abortion 100% legal and encourage      Pros   - women’s choice (hopefully males as well)      - slows overpopulation      - fiscal reasons      Cons      - loss of life      - used as a way to escape responsibilities      - polluting gene pool   (one of the top reasons people get abortions is because the baby has some sort of defect, the first thing the doctors ask a pregnant woman is if she wants to check the kid for deficiencies; the policy would then allow defects to slip though “the healthy kid” who still carries the same genes)      Abortion illegal exceptions for rape and incest      Pros      - protects life      Con      -pregnant females would claim rape more often to allow abortions to take place         Abortion illegal no matter what      Pros      - protects life      Cons      -rape, incest, ect         Fourth option would be if abortion was allowed only up to whatever point, third trimester, brain activity ect.

I have a friend of mine had some legal papers sent to him from an attorney regarding a default judgment from an old employer. When he was telling me about it a lot of things didn't make sense.    I said to him "If you have a default judgment against you then you must have been served paperwork . This guy doesn't lie and swears he knew nothing about this (I believe him). As he looked through the paperwork he found a copy of the proof of service and it shows that the summons was "mailed to him" through the US mail and not served personally "AND" it had the wrong address on the proof of service to where it was mailed. Now, this came from an attorney. This judgment is for $50,000.00. Not chump change. Wouldn't the Judge have noticed the improper proof of service? I am going to file a "request vacate the default judgment," based on the illegal proof of service. Am I correct? isn't the proof of service invalid????

Hi,      This is mainly addressed to Christians who have a problem with the idea of gay "marriage," especially to those who are willing to have a "civil union" instead.      What entitles Christians to own the word "marriage"? If you really are opposed to gay people being allowed to marry, why aren't you also pushing for amendments to block other people from marrying? It's also a sin for Christians to marry non-Christians, why aren't you pushing for a proposition to stop that? Why aren't you trying to stop Jew and Muslims from marrying?      After all, their "marriages" are just as sinful. Why just pick on gays?

Now it's some by the end of 2010, with plans to keep at least 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011 at the earliest, but likely longer.        Those darn facts keep getting in the way of old Barry don't they?  Of course, his apostles don't have enough brain cells to notice...

I recently moved into a house under the impression I was renting from the owner. 2 weeks later a Realtor shows up and says the owner has received no money for months and we are squatting on the property. She does know who I gave the money to and that he used to live here, he was friends of the property manager(who is currently in jail). But was not authorized to move new tenants in. The realtor did say she would work with us to try to keep us in the house. The guy I gave the money to says he has a month to come up with money to keep the house but the realtor says that is not the case. He also got money from three other people the same way he did me.

Okay so im in a huge problem, 5 months ago I wanted to shoplift from a store so i took a scarf and put it in my bag...i felt so bad i just could not do it, so i put it back on the shelf and walked out, the boy called the cops on me so they searched me. They didnt write a citation or arrest me because i didnt walk out with it, but the county police took a note of me and said that if i tried to steal in their county again they would know id been given a warning.      So last month I was being stupid and shoplifted from a store at the mall but it was in a different county than the first one, and this time i got a court date and everything...when i go to court will they be able to see what happened last time in a different county, and would they count that as a prior?

Additional Details   My wife receives child support from the biological father. How much will this complicate things? In reality this child support was sought through trial -- the biological father has never seen my, has not expressed any interest at all(thankfully) in doing so.      Is that good enough to make a case for abandonment?

20090307183707AAP3le9	Politics & Government;Military	Another Military medical history DQ question (hyper/hypothyroid)?	I've read the military standards of medical fitness and I've searched the military forums as well as yahoo answers about this condition and trying to cover up something on your medical record, but I ask you this:      I had mild hyperthyroid which even a history of disqualifies, but it was treated with radioactive Iodine, and now i have *mild hypothyroid controlled by medication* which according to the standards of medical fitness is not a disqualification.       So, if I tell them about my mild hypothyroid controlled by medication, and lets say accidentally forget to mention it was previously hyperthyroid? what do you think would happen?      it doesn't make sense to me why hypo is not DQ and hyper is DQ, especially since now i have the non DQ condition.       any feedback would be appreciated

20090307185810AAH2gc6	Politics & Government;Politics	Do u think Obama's addiction to teleprompters is A) the way of the future B) proof he's full of empty rhetoric?	 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/us/pol...       "Presidents have been using teleprompters for more than half a century, but none relied on them as extensively as Mr. Obama has so far. While presidents typically have used them for their most important speeches to the nation — an inauguration, a State of the Union or an Oval Office address — Mr. Obama uses them for everyday routine announcements, and even for the opening statement at his news conference."       http://www.usnews.com/blogs/robert-schle...       "Emphasis on Obama's use of teleprompters has long been a right wing (and, I suppose, pro-Hillary) anti-Obama talking point, the implicit criticism being that since he's such a good speaker he should be able to work without prepared remarks. Inability to do so, one supposes, is supposed to indicate that he is merely an empty vessel—an actor reading someone else's fancy words."

20090307191227AA4TMYz	Politics & Government;Politics	Who do you think will lose it first: Cramer, Hannity, or Limbaugh?	I was watching Mad Money and Cramer looks kinda like he is about to implode.  He prowls around on the stage with his photos of Mao and Lenin, and mumbles about the "Bolsheviks in Washington" which, isn't all that far off.  Hannity looks kinda like his head is about to split in half with that forced smile on his face.  Limbaugh looks like the Hindenberg right before ignition.  I think that hearing aid that is drilled into his head might be picking up excess microwaves from the oven in the employee breakroom.      If I was to guess, I'd say Sean Hannity is going to show up one day at the MSNBC studios looking for Keith Obermann.  He will be shirtless and looking like Rambo, with an M-16 in one hand, and a Bible in the other, screaming about the constitution before he empties a couple of clips into the studio lights.

We already wasted billions of dollars in the middle east, not too forget we have tragically lost 4,500 men in that region. What good would it do to prevent drugs? Why not legalize it, tax it, and regulate just like we do it with alcohol, and tobacco? Intervening will only spread the chaos into our region, not prevent it.

So why not give everyone over 20 who earns less than ￡50000 a tax free ￡1000. Some would pay off loans ( helping the banks) some would put into bank accounts (again helping the banks) some may even buy cars (helping the motor industry). The increase in spending would stimulate the economy. Cost to the exchequer a mere ￡20 Billion. Problem solved.

20090307194425AAFNpHg	Politics & Government;Politics	How would you define liberal?	I am not conservative.  That I know.      But what makes me liberal?  Am I?      I'm fiscally conservative in the sense that I don't want the government to spend poorly.  I am not opposed to taxes as long as I think the money is being used wisely.  Unlike conservatives, I do believe that the government can spend money wisely.  They don't always, but it's not my starting position that government is bad.      Also, I believe that we the people own the debt and we must pay it off.  And to do that we have to pay taxes.      Socially, I can easily see that I don't agree with conservatives.  I'm pro-choice (but favor the choice not being abortion).  I believe in equal rights and opportunity for all (read civil unions for everyone).  I believe that religion is a great thing for those who have it.  I don't have it, don't want it.  I don't believe that I should be subjected to religion at a school or courthouse or any other public location.      I believe in the right to have guns.  I also believe in responsibility as well.  I also believe that the government can regulate gun ownership.  I believe any regulation they pass should be tested all the way to the Supreme Court, but that regulation of gun ownership is not wrong.      So what's a liberal?

America is being fleeced and I have the concern that the fleecing will not be reserved for just within our borders.   I feel that they think they can get away just about anything now ..that their mission impossible will work because they want it to. The republicans have played a game of cat and mouse with these powers and have understood the game for a long long time...this administration is just making a lot of noise thinking that they can outsmart other governments as easily as they outsmarted a captive public here. They would be wrong. And nobody is going to support them when it is known that they tried to rob other countries.

20090307193828AAa2Cst	Politics & Government;Military	You know its coming....?	We all know that war is coming(Not a pissy war like Afghanistan, but a real full on war), of course there are signs but nothing hugely significant yet. Im just saying that if you had half a brain you would think we will have another world war in the next 40 years, which is when most of the people using yahoo answers spend most of their life(The next 40 years) so chances are it will effect us a bit more than the people dying in the next 10 years. But anyways back to my question.....         When a world war breaks out again what do you think will happen, its tough to say in one question so here are a few....      1.Who do you think will start it and how?   2.How long until nukes are involved(if it didnt start with on)   3.What will be the sides to choose   4.Who will lead each side you thought of   5.How will it end   6.What will happen when its all over   7.Whats your estimated death count?

20090307190906AABOHGw	Politics & Government;Immigration	Do you think this is fair (immigration)?	First off I want to say that I am not complaining,       Right now I am a Sophomore with a 3.8 GPA, without one single detention,  no Saturday schools (never have gotten in major trouble), with and Excellent citizenship grade in all my classes trying his best to get through school.        The only problem is that I see no where to go after high school. Why? I don't have a number (SSN). I can't get a decent job so I can at least try to pay my way through college, but I can't get financial aide either because no SSN. There's more. . . I can't drive.      Do you really think that this is fair? Please don't pull the card to blame my parents because all they wanted was the best for me. I can't blame them.       I know that the chances of this is very very rare but, If I write to President Obama what are the chances that he will actually read the letter. I am a decent writer, and I feel that if I am able to get to his hands I could persuade him a little.      I am not saying to make all illegal immigrants legal because I do agree with you that some are up to do harm, but there are some that just want to look for that American dream.      REMEMBER at one time or another one of you ancestor had to immigrate here. (Unless you are full blood Native American)      I know it was long but   Thank You for Your Time   Please leave your comments

Give me a real answer. I know that Wall Street was too highly leveraged into the MBS, but if the libs would've never made banks give bad loans, no one would've been able to invest in the first place. Even still, how was that Bush's fault?

20090307193113AAymH67	Politics & Government;Politics	How is it justifiable for Israel to exist?  Because nobody wants Muslims to exist?	How is it ever justifiable for Israel to attack?  Firstly, forget that their opponants are Muslims (because as soon as Muslims are mentioned, the West automatically dubs them as the enemies) and consider what is involved here.      Israel "legally" stole the land of a country because they had nowhere else left to go after the Nazi's and had some sort of "claim" to this land because it was "supposedly" theirs thousands of years ago.  So how is this justifiable at all?  How can the West legalize the theft of land of another country just from supernatural/religious tales from thousands of years ago?  Wouldn't you think that fighting for your land back after it was stolen is justifiable?      Now lets get back to whose land it was?  MUSLIMS!  Oh so now it IS justifiable.  This world is ridiculous.  And I'm not saying that everyone shares this view, you might think differently, but the majority of the world and especially the people with power in this world believe that.      Look at Bosnia for example, more than half of it now is "claimed" by Serbia and Croatia because Bosnians didn't deserve the land because they were Muslim and needed to be ethnically cleansed by the rape of 50 000 women and murder of 250 000 people in brutal ways. And what about now, after the war ended 14 years ago?  The West has not helped Bosnia get back their land which IS legally supposed to be theirs.  Why?  Because nobody wants Muslims to have any claim to power, and if that means taking away their homes and lives, so be it.  It's disgusting.      As soon as it comes to Muslims its like the theft of land is allowable.  And in this case because it involves Jews, everyone allows it because no one wanted the problem coming the their land, thats why the US and the UK and the UN aided this theft of land, because they didn't want the problem on their land.

20090307191012AAGzKqm	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are Republicans considered the war mongers?	Between The Civil War and the Iraq War, we have had 4 major conflicts.  They, and the president at their onset were:      WWI Wilson (D)   WWII Roosevelt (D)   Korean War Truman (D)   Yes, we had a Republican at the onset of the Vietnam era, but Dems followed very soon.        The trend seems anything but a confirmation that Republican policy creates these international issues.  Is it possible, then, that bad things happen and it is not the POTUS's fault?  Now, I don't care much for war myself, but as I watch the movie Pearl Harbor tonight, I can't help but think that maybe the Democrats have a worse history regarding their handling of international affairs.  And, how ironic it is that Republicans are considered the war mongers.  How wrong it is that we let these uninformed people corrupt our media with these lies.  Also, it makes me feel very proud to be an American first.

20090307191047AAMmmRo	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can a driver refuse to give his paperwork until the cop give you the reason for the stop?	i live in Pennsylvania. i was pulled over by the SAME cop on TWO separate occasions in the same neighborhood. in each incident i was driving the same car: a blue 2008 chevy trailblazer. the paper work is legit. the car is flawless. there were no tinted windows. there were no items obstructing view in my back window ie. teddy bears, hats etc. i wasn't speeding or made any traffic violations whatsoever. nor was i  driving erratically both times. it was midnight. the neighborhood is poor. i am black. during the first stop, the cop just asked me for my i.d. he didnt ask for my driver's license. nor did he ask for my registration and proof of insurance. i gave him my license immediately. he took it and went to his car. about five minutes later he came back, gave me my license and said he was letting go with a warning. i drove off. he never said why he pulled me over to begin with or say what he gave me a warning about. during the second stop, he asked me for my driver's license this time. however, again, no registration and proof of insurance. i asked him for the reason he pulled me over. he said he wanted my license first. i said i wanted to know the reason before i provide anything. he again asked for it. and i repeated what i said. i refused to give i.d. he went to his car and about two minutes later about ten squad cars showed up and they surrounded my car. each cop had their guns drawn. the original cop  told me to step out the car. i refused. the cops opened the door and threw me to the ground and handcuffed me. i wasnt charged with making any traffic violation. NOTHING. i say he was profiling and was looking for a reason for the stop as oppose to actually having a reason. thats why he didnt state the reason. some say that the cop wanted my i.d for his own safety. that's a moot point. if his concerned with his safety for genuine, he would have waited for back up to arrive before he stepped out his car, none the less approach my car. his words are a direct contradiction to his actions. anyway, can a driver refuse to give his paperwork until the cop give you the reason for the stop? please site cases and laws, if any. thanks in advance.

We have not broken any laws and the ranger and police find this an absolute waste of time. Recently whilst helping another neighbour (who the neighbours now ring to enquire about cows mooing)  we were informed that we should watch ourselves and the whole valley knows what is going on, and that a certain person could cause us some trouble.

20090307194834AAuJTe6	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How to file a discrimination/harassment suit against a company?	this is long i know... but please bare with me.. someone i know works for a tower painting/maintenance company for about 6 months now.  there have been some serious issues with him and a co worker. 1st of all, according to OSHA standards, these guys MUST use safety harnesses and tie offs or they pose a threat to other workers and could be fined. its a serious thing. this co worker does not do this and its been brought to the safety management attention and nothing is being done about it. there are photos to prove this. second, these guys travel around the country and live out of hotels for up to 8 weeks at a time and 1 week home.. one particular supervisor has been causing problems for many months and noone will do anything about it. rude comments, nasty behavior, belittling and embarrassing my friend in front of other co workers.. all the for the simple reason that he has 20 more years experience and knows what he is doing more than the lead guy, even though its not flaunted.. he just does his job and thats it. . today he just could not take anymore and he told the guy (nicely) the equipment would not have been broken down for days if it had been properly maintained before leaving for the trip and to stop blaming the other guys, this sent the supervisor flying off the handle he told him to "hit the ******* highway if you dont like it". so this my friend did (prolly so he would put his teeth down his throat lol) also, these guys are 40 miles away from their hotel and only the lead guy has a CDL to be able to drive them anywhere. my friend walked and walked for hours until someone was nice enough to pick him up.. very dangerous. the lead guy refused to give him a ride back after pretty much firing him. so he left him stranded 40 miles from the hotel and wouldnt let him back onthe job site either. my friend has spoken to his boss about it and since they get another story from the lead guy, naturally, they believe him. keep in mind there have been 16 people to quit under this guys supervision within 2 years, all due to a problem with him. now my friend is told he may lose his job over this situation and nothing being done about the other guys behavior. to take the cake.. they are flying him home tomorrow night and have booked him a flight to an airport 2 hours away that comes in at midnight.. i know that seems petty, but his wife has to pick him up and leaves for work at 4am. that doesnt really matter i know.. but we checked for him and there are other flights available for cheaper and closer.. we think it was just a dig, even though nothing can be done about that one.       my question is, who do we speak to or get ahold of to see if what they are doing with his job is legal? and if he has any rights about this issue or if he was just wrong for saying something finallty. this guy is a bully and someone needs to do something about it.
20090307194006AAxB2aU	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can the trust comp. legally come after me for a gift from my grandmother?	My grandmother gave me $12000 in two different checks.  This money was for vehicles.  The first was in 2000.  I paid back this loan.  The second check was in 2002, I paid back part of it, but since I was in school at the time, my grandmother forgave the remaining amount.  My grandmother recently passed away, and the trust company found copies of the checks that my grandmother had written to me.  The memo line states that it is a loan.  Now the trust company wants me to either prove that I paid back the loan or come up with all of the money.  Unfortuneatly, the bank cannot access records that far back.  I cannot prove that I paid anything.  Will something like this stand up in court, if I do not pay?  Any ideas???

Now that it seems the automakers will end up in receivership at least, why don't we skip the stupid electric hybrid nonsense and build nuclear-powered vehicles?

Let the Japanese, Chinese, and Germans mess around with batteries and plug-ins. Let them build go-karts that can travel 200 miles without charging up - we'll have 500-horsepower Escalades that can go a million miles without refueling or emitting a single ounce of carbon, and which would be vastly safer than riding around with 20 gallons of uber-flammable gasoline in a steel tank a few inches off the ground. Just imagine what that would to revitalize American industry and the economy!      So, do you agree? Is is time to get serious and start building nuke-powered vehicles?

Apparantly according to them no building has ever collapsed as a result of fire, and yet visual evidence show that the perimeter columns of the WTC are buckling in and then give way.  It is obvious there were no bombs in the impact zone.  if there were they would have gone off when the planes hit.  Now somebody would have had to know about where the plane was going to hit, and somehow rig the wtc for demolition (something that would have taken months), and they had to have bee timed just perfect to when the building began collapse.  This would have been nearly impossible, and we know they were not manually controlled because there was no det cord going into the building.  If the "Secondary Explosions" were really bombs then the building would have collapsed alot sooner then it did.

Yesterday Ron Paul participated in a Committee on the War Powers of the Executive Branch, specifically discussing the War Powers Resolution.      He gives his opening 1 minute statement, then follows up with his inquiry of former White House Chief of Staff James Baker where apparently Baker gets agitated at Ron Paul’s question regarding the competing war powers between the Legislative and Executive branches.      Of course, Paul’s position is the strict Constitutional position and Baker minces words in an attempt to make Paul out to be incorrect. In doing so Baker’s twisted logic gets the better of him, in my view.      Once again, Ron Paul exposes the fact that the supreme law of the land is no longer binding in America and has been bastardized for many years.      [video]      --      What do you think?

We have a state surplus, our budget balances because our state constitution says it has to. Our governor has line item veto power. We may not have all the social services the places like California, Michigan, and New York have but then we don't expect someone to wipe our nose when it's runny either. Our unemployment is well below the national average. While our housing prices have dropped some it's not bad. But then we don't have a lot of speculators buying houses here. If you have good credit our banks will lend to you. If you don't don't expect them to lend you anything.       It sure is tough living in one of those backward redneck states. You see we don't expect government to take care of most of the problems. Why? Because we realize most politicians are lawyers. We go to lawyers when we need legal matters taken care of.

Now I know I'm 18 and can do whatever I want, but I have to much respect for my parents just to tell them that.  With that being said, I have been talking to a recruiter for about 3 months now without my parents knowledge and I need to go in for the ASVAB and physical.      Well my family is, let's say pretty well off, so this is not something expected for me to do.  I just turned 18 and have close to 50ish college credits and I would be getting my AA before enlisting.  I plan on doing college for 2 years while I am in, because my recruiter took 18 credit college semesters while enlisted, and then transfer over to officer school or just get a "real" job once my 4 years are up.      So I am not sure how to approach my parents about this, especially since I don't normally talk to them about this kind of stuff.  I want to move out and my parents don't want to pay for my boarding anywhere so I couldn't afford to live away from home.      Thanks!

20090307172239AAFgwcZ	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why is the obama administration considering setting up a national bank to hold bad debts while handing out..?	why should obama even consider a plan that the federal government, which has already given over HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of our dollars to banks with bad loans (and who now have their hands out for another TWO TRILLION) open a "national bank" to buy up such bad loans and then sell them in time to the public sector, without expecting that these private banks and bankers WORK to refinance the bad loans into good loans?      you must ask yourself this:  "what is the business of a bank?"  and the answer is only this:  the business of a bank is to make money.  that is the ONLY business of a bank.        and so, if the obama administration is considering using our tax dollars that are non existent anyway to establish a national bank that will buy up bad loans, how would that benefit you and i?        why is no rule put upon the banks that want more and more and more of our money to bail them out of the financial crisis that they themselves put themselves into requiring that they, themselves, who are in the sole business of making money, to require that they restructure their own lousy loans so that such loans become profitable to them rather than putting their fat hands out to collect even more money from not only you and i, but from our progeny?        why should we even consider allowing the federal government to set up and run a bank that will absorb bad loans?  would it be profitable to we, the people?        as far as i can see, practically anything that the federal government puts its inept nose into fails and/or makes our lives more complicated by more and more federal regulations, which in turn create jobs within the federal government itself, but do nothing to benefit the working man?  will a national bank that buys up bad loans benefit the people of america?  why would it?        take a look at the article linked here:   http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/200...       and then, please give me your PERSONAL opinion, as a citizen of this country, as to why you would want the federal government to open up an institution whose sole purpose is to make money, i.e., a national bank?        would you deposit your wages (if any) into such a federal national bank?  why would you do that?  what reward would you get for doing so?  do you think that the interest that the federal government MIGHT pay you would be worth your deposits, just like the deposits that you make to the federal government out of your paycheck in the form of taxes that are supposed to pay for those things that you need which you cannot pay for yourself (such as war)?        don't you think that rather than our federal government building up its "national bank" that the lenders that made bad loans out of their greed, so that they could continue paying themselves millions in salary and bonuses and perks and stock options while being seated each day in plush offices with views from huge windows that you'd just love to be able to have yourself from your house (condo), should have to put their loan officers to WORK at making those bad loans into profitable, good loans?      it's so simple.  we give $0.00 to the banks.  they already took our money with no requirement that they account for how they spent it.  so now they say it is not enough.  okay, if it is not enough, why don't they figure out how they can make money off of their loans?  if that is the business of a bank--making money--and it is, the only business at that, why don't they figure out yet more creative ways to shut down this foreclosure disaster and change it to profitable business for them?        this is what they do with their bad mortgage loans:  they rewrite them into fixed rate, (very) long term mortgages.  they fix the rate of interest at only one point above the prime rate, as it is today.  and then they stretch out the amortization schedule of repayment to 100 years or more than 100 years in order that the payments are profitable to them.  and they charge "points" (a point is one percent of the face value of a loan) to refinance these bad loans, but they put these points into the loan itself.  and of course, they charge their outrageous fees, but they put those fees into the loan also.  in fact, they could structure the new mortgages so that their points and fees are what is paid first.        if you own real estate, you should call up your real estate broker so that s/he will print out an amortization schedule for you so that you can see how much of what you pay per month goes towards interest on your principal balance.  this way you will understand what i am proposing.  ("amort" is a french word that means "to kill," to kill off the principal).        okay, if you do not agree with the above work that the banks should do, which will keep their employees employed and paying taxes to the government (about $0.61 out of every dollar that they spend, all taxes over the year combined), then what do you propose that the banks do?  do you propose that they

20090307171555AAkj9bI	Politics & Government;Military	Which Service do you honestly think is the best to join?	Pick one.  I'm taking a poll.  More than 1 answer or any answer besides 1 specific branch does not answer my question so I'll just ignore it.      1.. Air Force (intelligent minds, best of everything - food, housing, facilities, treatment and fairness to women, safety, job placement outside of the military)... and the only downside is you don't see a lot of combat, no infantry, they call you the chair force and you go home at night and stay alive.  This seems to be the no non-sense branch.  They come in bomb you, take over your country, and leave.  They don't care much for medals and boot camp bragging ... they seem more inept to just do their job quietly and you'll never even know they were there.  Probably the most important and powerful branch in the U.S. arsenal... but they already know that so no need to brag about themselves.  This is truly the brains of the military.  Is this your thing?      2- Navy .... Lots of travel, pretty safe, treatment of women is fair...advancement is decent.  Living conditions are almost as good as the Air Force.  Good medical and nuclear programs, SEAL's for those with a combat itch.  Downside could be getting stuck on ships a lot ... or maybe you like ships.  The Marines poke fun at you and say they are the "men's" department of the Navy.  They call you semen... other than that...jobs are good for retired Navy.  This branch seems to be the branch behind the scenes.  A Lot gets down, and the power of the Navy is not fully recognized.  The experience and adventures seem never ending here.  Is this your thing?      3.. Army -- Biggest branch, a lot of room for advancement.  Everything from infantry to technology to aviation and Special Forces.  Very dangerous and more people die in the Army than all the other Services combined by about 3 to 1.  Living conditions stink but are better than Marines.  This seems to be the practical branch that sacrifices the most(especially in human lives) but they get the job done.  They don't care much for title and pretty uniforms.  This is the most humble branch I would say.  Dirty work... not a lot of respect for it.  The Marines will take the respect for the blood you shed and the work that you did.  The Air Force and Navy will take the respect for the technology that you help provide and the wars you win.  They are in it to win it.  Is this your thing?      4 -- Marine Corps... You get a title for graduating 13 weeks of screaming.  Toughest boot champ pride.   Can call yourself a Marine.  There aren't a whole lot of positives in comparison to other branches because the Marines have the worst living conditions of all the services.  They seem to pride themselves on this misery and the reputation of the Corps from those that served in it before.  So pretty much the main reason to be in this branch is if you like titles and going to combat... respect is what I think you're looking for here.  They are in it for the camaraderie.  They even call themselves brothers.  Is this your thing      5- Coast Guard -- this is a non combat branch and if saving lives instead of taking them is your thing.  This would seem to be why they sign up.  So others may live.  Is this your thing?

But shes been so sneaky and I can see right through her that shes only playing with his head. But my friend doesn't believe me. I had to save him so I made up an small aim conversation between and this girl. Making the girl say one sentence that would prove shes been lying. My friend believed me and now says he wont talk to her anymore. But he showed this girl and she is denying she ever said that (which she didnt). she lives in a whole other country and threatened to have me arrested for forgery. I only forged ONE sentence. And it was to save my friend...Can she really have me arrested for this? especially living in different countries?
