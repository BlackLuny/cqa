Htgj1LL6aa	on average a web page is about 1 megabyte, some much less some much more. thats why i say average. myspace? tons of bandwidth going down the drain. youtube? consider blocking that site permanently.<br>  200 mb is not enough like i answered in your last question. 450 web pages a month will net you on average 450 mb in usage, this does not cover the rest of your usage. youtube per video? really depends on the length. and we know myspace people like adding tons of content. you will want about 2-3 gigabytes for your family i would say is safe.<br>  dont get me wrong though pages like this are only 20-50 kilobytes in size. my average is a high one, but it account for all the top websites which alot of them are bandwidth hogs. 1000 kilobytes in a megabyte, 1000 megabytes in a gigabyte.

ySKsOfIMaa	I would go with either nVidia or ATI over VIA simply because nVidia and ATI are much more widely supported. You can have the best piece of hardware in the world, but it doesn't matter any if no one supports it.<br>  <br>  As for whether to go with the nVidia or ATI card, flip a coin - neither will do anything spectacular in this generation, but they both beat out integrated graphics.<br>  <br>  Edit: Did a bit more searching, and it turns out the VIA Chrome is itself an integrated video chipset. This makes it somewhat interesting to compare to a dedicated card; an integrated chipset will "borrow" your system's RAM and CPU cycles whereas a dedicated card has its own. It literally depends on how much you give it, assuming your motherboard gives you the option - many simply set it to a percentage of your total system resources.<br>  <br>  In other words, just about any dedicated card will be better than what you have right now - including the two you listed.

In the past, before legislation stopped it, a few bosses would simply fire a female employee who needed leave for childbirth reasons.<br>  Do your bosses attempt casual conversation with you?  If so, you must try to respond in a positive friendly manner.  On first seeing your immediate boss when returning to work after the weekend, you could try a friendly approach by asking him/her if he/she had a nice weekend.<br>  How do you get along with your own co-workers?  If you are seen as cold and aloof, this is not good.  Even though you are a dedicated worker, you should try to blend in and be seen as a part of a happy team by joining in their conversations.

ySKsOfIMaa	You really need to do something about your CPU, whether it's getting better thermal compound, a beefier heatsink, or replacing a bad fan - 75C is extremely hot for a CPU (to put in perspective how hot that is, most motherboards by default kill the computer at 70-80C). That could even very well be your problem - many CPUs will clock themselves down if they get too hot, assuming the motherboard itself doesn't cut the computer off on its own. This underclocking process could be causing issues in the game, Windows, other hardware devices - they'll turn themselves down to 1Hz if they have to just to keep from frying.<br>  <br>  Edit: If it's coming from your speakers, it could be Spore causing it to play the sound.

ySKsOfIMaa	Short answer: no.<br>  <br>  Long answer: it really depends on the program just how much it relies on on the GPU versus the CPU. As an example, there are people who have made programs that brute-force crack passwords (something you would expect to be hugely CPU-intensive) using only the GPU.<br>  <br>  Besides, if you downgrade the GPU, you could very well create an even worse bottleneck - this time at the GPU instead of the CPU.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	I doubt that you'd get much money for a second hand AGP card, if you're serious about spending money then you'd be best to buy a PCI express based board, 3D card and processor and start from there.|`|Pxkqq8r2aa	well I can guarantee you zero performance benefit from selling the gpu. <br>  <br>  You will end up with less vram and way less video processing power. <br>  <br>  I just dont follow your logic.

d3b8d95f3c206880dff89e3a0ed42336aa	Don't but Lexmark unless your bank account has several noughts on the end! Canon are a good printer maker but the one you stated has the new generation of cartridges which only hold a small amount of ink. You should shop around for cheaper cartridges as 10% seems like a good deal but that stills makes them dearer than from other places like in the link below. With the 10%off at Argos the 511 works out at ￡10.45 and 511 ￡16,79 which is a combined total of ￡30.04. In the link below they cost ￡10.49 for the 510 and ￡14.50 for the 511 which comes to ￡24.99 for both a saving of ￡5 on the Argos offer price, so Argos's deal is not as good as it seems.<br>  <a href="http://www.inkmasters.co.uk/acatalog/Canon_Pixma_MP260_printer_ink_cartridges.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inkmasters.co.uk/acatalog/Can...</a>|`|ChZQZXQ9aa	cost being an issue the new Kodak printer is reasonable the nice thing is the ink cartridges are only $9.00 usd print way more pictures than other types.|`|z46THMt8aa	I dont know how much of this info applies to the UK but:<br>  <br>  Lexmark has been known as the "drug dealer" of the printer world (along with Dell). They sucker you in with cheap printers and then rip you off on cartridges which cost more than the printer. Take the price of cartridges into account when choosing the printer.<br>  As long as cartridges remain sealed and in a comfortable environment (not too hot or too cold) they will last for years. I once found HP cartridges 4 years past the expiration date. I gave then to someone who still had that printer and they worked.<br>  <br>  Here is info on printers. It's meant for the US but maybe it will give you some ideas.<br>  As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  Right now Epson is having a blowout on the R280 for $60! It prints on DVDs.<br>  <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?oid=63069504&RMID=200903_high_inventory&RRID=1013876963" rel="nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Personally I prefer the HP printers some of which have 5 colour and one black cartridge. This means that if one runs out you are not wasting ink.<br>  <br>  The cartridges supplied with the printers usually have less ink than a standard one. <br>  <br>  All cartridges are sealed and so won't dry out.

V3ULgX9eaa	well you have a 480watt power supply fitted but i would get a new one if you can. preferably a quality 500watt one. Corsair, Be Quiet, Antec, Seasonic and Enermax are good PSU's. I would choose this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151049" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  Graphics wise you can fit any pci express graphics card you like! I would go with this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143162" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|isadV8SHaa	Before you blow all $250 on the video card, there is a really important thing you should check first.  Emachines have a bad reputation for shipping with very low quality power supplies.  In most cases the power supply will not be able to power much more than the machine it shipped with.  A modern video card has a very high chance of pushing your power supply past it's capabilities.  This will either have your machine shutting itself down all the time, or will just blow the power supply.<br>  <br>  I would first check to see if the supply even gives you any PCI-E connectors, and even if it did, I would think seriously about buying a better one.  When/if you do, make sure you read reviews, don't just go by watts or price.  I have been using this power supply in all of my recent budget builds:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371007" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  It's not pretty, but it's really solid and has a decent price.<br>  <br>  I like the ATi graphics technology better than the Nvidia.  This is a matter of personal preference, really.  The card I would recommend for your machine is this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102770" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  It is powerful, but won't break the bank.  You can get both of these items at the links provided and still be under your budget.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  P.S.  I just discovered that you posted this exact question yesterday, word for word.  I  am cross posting to that question as well.  I have to say that i am pleasantly surprised to see that James B. and I both have essentially the same answer for you (complete with links to Newegg! hehe)  Most answers I come across here, the people don't know what they are talking about.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>               yes allthough intel have been involved in a lawsuit with nvidia(allthough nvidia claim its the other way round) this does not have any bearing on which nvidia cards you can use on the x58 chipset<br>               popular cards are obviously the gtx285/295,s which will blaze through todays games like crysis and company of heroes,however in sli some manufacturers have gone with the geforce 9800gtx+ which also performs well in sli(and tri sli)<br>               so anything above the 9800gt would be ok,and even the 8800gtx would be ok since i have seen these for as low as ￡100 on some websites and allthough these are now 2 years old they are still extremely powerful and running two of these would eat up any of todays titles no problem<br>                    good luck mate !

m13Se2dAaa	There are 2 possible ways of making a global change like that, but it all depends on how you set up your slides to begin with. One or the other may work, but there's a better chance that neither will ;-(<br>  <br>  1) Best bet - if you are actually using the Slide Masters and the sentences are yellow in the Master, you can change the color to Red and it should change it on all the slides that used that Master. If it doesn't, you would have to re-apply the master, but that will change any other custom formatting you have done as well.<br>  <br>  2) If the yellow you used for the sentences is a color out of the Color Scheme, you could go into the Scheme and change it to red. Again, that should change the color.<br>  <br>  That's about it as far as your choices go. Just a note though, about changing colors - once you have selected the first piece of text and gone into the palette to get the red and made the text red, when you select the next piece of text, you don't have to go digging back into the color palette - just click on the font color A symbol - it holds the red color. Small tip to make changing colors faster.

6d5bdf6230eca83dfd8afc1857b2268eaa	Dear Pal, there are only three primary color 1. Red, 2. Blue, 3 Yellow and all other colors are combination of these colors in different ratio . If TV is able to reflect any color mention above or its combination is called colored TV. Black and white are neural colors. So, TV may be called as neural TV. <br>  <br>  Further, every object has the properties to absorb or reflect the colors present in light, and the reflected back light got the sensation to our eyes and that is the color of that object. for example if color of pen is blue than it means that the pen has the capacity to absorb all color of light except green, so green color is reflected back to our eyes and we say that pen is green. however same pen will look black in presence of pure red light. as  pure red light does not has green color so pen is not reflecting any colors and our eye is not getting any color so green pen will look black in red light.<br>  <br>  So, if an object is not reflecting any color present in light, it will look black, and if object has reflected all color means not absorbed any color it will look white. in both case of black and white, the TV is not doing anything With basic hue of colors (not reflecting any color BLACK, and not absorbing any color WHITE), so we cannot call it as a colored TV. AS ONLY TWO COLOR (BLACK AND WHITE) IS USED SO TV IS BLACK AND WHITE COLOR TV. OTHER WSE IT IS A ALL COLOR TV.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Yes. I think.

Even check Norton's website for a removal tool for it.<br>  <br>  I've also had good luck with an online scanner run by Trend Micro.  It's at the link below.

OdvF41IMaa	Yes!  Mivid.net is, in my opinion, the best quality video sharing site I have ever used.  Its pretty small, but its growing fast.  They have been through alot as of lately as they were updating their site, but it should be fully functional now.  They don't resize your video at all (it can be up to 1080p, but 720p is recommended as it loads faster).  The quality is great for all videos and I love their support.  I get more from them than I did from video sites I had to pay to use.  Mivid.net uses an encoding process used by nobody else in the world with a very different flv codec.  If you upload an flv or mp4 encoded with h264, Mivid.net can use it as it is so there is no conversion whatsoever and there is no loss of quality because the video you upload is the video you see.  I highly recommend Mivid.net.|`|dp4hrRkgaa	try veoh.com

The answer depends on who makes it. Some Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) call their mobile computers "laptops" and some call them "notebooks". The terms are often used interchangeably.<br>  <br>  My personal distinction between a laptop and a notebook is this: <br>  <br>  Laptop computers are somewhat larger than notebooks and will accommodate a built-in disk drive unit and; optionally, a floppy drive unit. That is, a CD ROM drive is either built into the unit or the unit has a built-in bay that will accommodate a removable CD ROM drive. <br>  <br>  Notebook computers will allow you to attach, via cable, a CD ROM drive. Since the drive is not built into the unit, notebooks are smaller and lighter than laptops. Hence, a notebook is an ultra small laptop. Another way to look at it is a notebook is about the size (or a little larger than) of a real notebook.|`|15HLj6fraa	Notebooks are SUPPOSED to be smaller and thinner (therefore "notebook" expression!), while laptop are supposed to be sitting in you lap because they should be a little bit on the heavy side...

It depends on how close you are to the telephone exchange for a start on how strong the signal will be.  I am a firm believer however that though it is more expensive, BT broadband is the best.  I have never had any problems with it and use it on all my computers.|`|1a5c9f0abed79e678ede79f9dadff9feaa	Not unless someone is in your area. Broadband can vary from city to city and some cities have 2 broadband carrier providers.<br>  <br>  They don't have the capability to compete in one area or on 1 street.<br>  <br>  Sarge|`|zpUf3Kvuaa	ok your asking cheapest but trust me that dosnt go with most reliable. First off all broadband suppliers can have troubles. Ok im with BT, not the cheapest but you get 3 main options according to how you use your internet. Are you a heavy user? download films, music and gaming? or you just browse the net for a few hours maybe a little gaming? Go onto BT and check the options, match the one to your usage and check everything you get with it. You get first 3months half price with BT any option.<br>  Ok why BT, well i got a few friends on other BB services and we game alot. 1 is on orange, he lives in town, about a mile closer to the telephone exchange than me yet i get around 1mb more speed than him. He loses connection alot too and he had to buy a new router because orange wouldnt do anything to help. He has recently changed BB to BT now after seeing how much faster and more reliable my connection is. Another friend is on AOL, now when we are in chat partys and games he gets dropped loads, his connection is slower than mine and he lives in a massive town compared to me, he to has had router problems, was on the phone for hours to AOL trying to sort it but they did send him another router unlike orange, he is waiting for his contract to run out then changing to BT. <br>  So cheaper dosnt always work, most reliable, all internet providers have issues. Sorry long story but hopefully you will be a bit closer to what you want.|`|6e1900d7b64ea005bd49f87f1a831a95aa	I'm currently on Virgin and this is the cheapest and one of the best services ever.

zpUf3Kvuaa	ok first do you have a router with more than 1 ethernet connection? If yes then shouldnt be to much trouble. second what modem/router you got? If its a BT router then your laughing as its just plug and play with them. 3rd you didnt say if they are first xboxs or the 360's. If they are the 360 and you dont want wires then you can buy the wireless adapter from any game shop for the 360 and your away. If your going wired then you will need to buy ethernet cable that is long enough to reach where you xbox is from the router. I bought 10mtrs of ebay for a tenner before so it dosnt really cost.<br>  Xbox connected to the router by ethernet cable means you dont need your pc on. <br>  If you are not with BT then you may get a problem with the router and need to setup your ip address and dns on the xbox, if thats the case you will need to search again for how to do that.<br>  Good luck.<br>  PS the black BT hub i have has 4 ethernet ports on it. i run my pc, 2 xbox 360s and my BT vision all at once from this and i have 2 laptops running through the wireless connection too with no troubles. Everything is plug and play on this modem.
3XMCQ4Spaa	Pretty many and the number is increasing.  And even more allows OO as optional component.  Mind you, for lot of them -- like C++ and ObjectPascal (and to some degree VisualBasic, Delphi) -- they've taken a *structured* programming langauge (like C and Pascal) and just added features for object-orienting.  And other more "pure" oo-languages -- like Java and C# -- has been so much inspired by such languages (C and C++), thet they're really not very good OO-langauges.<br>  <br>  C++ totally lacks a coherent class-hiarchy, although some can optionally be added (like iostream).  If you add several optional components, you will get several seperated hiarchies.  Java is somewhat better because it does have one hierachy.  Unfortunately, the primitive types (char, int, float, ...) are defined *outside* this hierachy.  Also, although Java is fully object-oriented, it leans heavely on it's more structured C/C++ ancestory... much is done "the C way", rather than "the oo-way".<br>  <br>  To really sink your teeth into OO and understand the beauty of it, I would recomend other languages.  Languages designed as OO from the beginning.  A very good choice is SmallTalk, where everything -- incuding the langauge itself -- is part of *one single* large hiarachy.  Playing around SmallTalk, will give you a feel for what OO is all about and make you think in the OO-way... this is then something you then can take with you to other "lesser" OO-languages, like C++ or Java.<br>  <br>  Java is special because it was the first C-derived language with at least somewhat coherent class-hiearchy.  It was designed with security in mind.  It combines compiling and interperting, by "compiling" the program into "byte-code", which can then be interperted by the "Java Virtual Machine"... a rather novell approach.  It was designed to allow one to make "applets" -- specially designed programs to be downloaded over the net, and inserted into web-pages on your browser -- to run in other applications (like web-browsers).  <br>  <br>  IMHO, Java is not a very good langauge -- and an even worse OO-language.  It's large advantage, is the connectivity with the web.  It's slow and sluggish, which is a problem when making stand-alone applications.  If you're not intending to make web-applications, there would be little reason to learn Java...  Except for the fact that Java has got so much good press, that it has become a langauge employers ask for.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	There are a LOT.  Smalltalk was the first back in the seventies and of course C, Cobol and Pascal all have Object-oriented versions (in Pascal's case both Delphi and Modula.  The list on the wikipedia has almost a hundred, including extensions and derivatives.  It's probably incomplete:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-orie...</a><br>  <br>  What makes Java so special is it was the first object-oriented interpreted language optimized for internet and cross-platform operation.  Think of it as midway between C++ and JavaScript and you will begin to get some idea of why it is so special.  It's a Goldilocks language which is "Just Right" for some people.|`|gBdVn9Bzaa	There are more than 100 Object Oriented Programming Languages.<br>  Java is the special among them because it is the first purely Object Oriented Programming Language. It is better than C++ (which was developed before Java and which is not pure object oriented language) in terms of memory management (garbage collector) and others. It has also got many more features.

Easiest interface to use, very fast scanning and doesn't lag your computer at all. Only has a 76% detection rate, but catches the most harmful of viruses. If you're a normal home user, you're not in too much danger of higher level viruses and this is the AV for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.free.grisoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.free.grisoft.com</a><br>  <br>  2) Avast! 4 AntiVirus. Smaller, sleeker skin, average scanning speed, but reports alot of safe files as viruses, so you might need to watch out for that. 78% detection rate, but alot more complicated than most other free AVs. Use this if you are handy with a computer and you know what needs to be scanned:<br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  3) Avira AntiVirus. Simple layout, which even the most basic of users can navigate. Incredibly fast scanning, with a 90% detection rate. Not as easy on the eyes as other AVs, and you need to know what you're doing to get the more advanced features, but it is definite a candidate:<br>  <a href="http://www.free-av.com/en/download/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-av.com/en/download/index...</a><br>  Personally I use AVG, but only because I go for the easier interface. If you are paranoid about viruses then the only real option is Avira. But if you just want normal protection, then any of the three will do it for you.<br>  <br>  For any spyware problems, get SpyBot - Search and Destroy:<br>  <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirrors/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/en/mirro...</a><br>  And for protecting your computer for malware or tracking cookies, use Ad-Aware 2008 Free Edition:<br>  <a href="http://lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php" rel="nofollow">http://lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_fr...</a><br>  <br>  All of them are free, as powerful as paid programs, like McAfee and Norton (which only has an 18% detection rate!), and don't use up as many resources.<br>  Just boot into Safe Mode (Press F8 when turning on the computer) and run full scans.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps~|`|bJqS9GYOaa	I use avast.  it is very good and free.

I do not believe it matters which Service Pack or whatnot. Any will do. You are going to reinstall Windows (regardless of version, you can install Windows XP next to another installation of Windows XP, it's dual-booting the same OS) to regenerate HAL.DLL.<br>  <br>  Now, follow these steps.<br>  1. Boot from the CD and start the installer<br>  2. Choose to install onto the already formatted partition with the unbootable Windows, but opt to leave the existing filesystem and any other OSes alone. Choosing this will require you to create another folder for Windows to avoid writing over the existing installation (that it somehow sees now but not when the Repair "Scanning for previous installations of Windows" is run, argh!) I usually call the new folder "WINXP."<br>  3. Install Windows as you would normally, you'll need a Product Key but you can actually use your personal key on someone else's computer with no danger to you losing it or being accused of piracy, I'll explain this later.<br>  4. Boot the NEW Windows XP install. Do not "Activate" or "register," you're going to be deleting this copy of Windows from the machine if all goes well.<br>  5. Edit the BOOT.INI on the hard drive from the original installation of Windows with the corrupted HAL if you messed it up like I did and had four OS entries in it, none of which worked. This usually happens when you try to use the method outlined in the InformationWeek article repeatedly and it does not work.<br>  6. Go to C:\WINXP\system32\hal.dll (where "WINXP" is the folder you installed the second copy of Windows XP) and copy it from the new Windows to C:\WINDOWS\system32\hal.dll (or wherever you installed Windows XP originally, I use "WINDOWS" but some people use strange folder names for their XP) and overwrite any file there. The new hal.dll is uncorrupt and newly regenerated. The file is specific to each machine's hardware configuration and we needed to rebuild it. The installer did that for us with the new installation.<br>  7. Try rebooting your computer to see if you can get into your OLD Windows installation. If you can, congratulations!<br>  8. DELETE the "WINXP" folder (or wherever you put your new Windows install). <br>  <br>  OR read this:<br>  <br>  # Restart the PC. The hal.dll error could be a fluke.<br>  <br>  # Check for proper boot order in BIOS. You might see the hal.dll error if the boot order in BIOS is first looking at a hard drive other than your main hard drive.<br>  <br>  Note: If you've recently changed your boot order or recently flashed your BIOS, this may be what's causing your problem.<br>  <br>  # Run Windows XP System Restore from a command prompt. If this doesn't work or you're receiving the hal.dll error message before you're able to complete this process, move on to the next step.<br>  <br>  # Repair or replace the boot.ini file. This will work if the cause of the problem is actually Windows XP's boot.ini file and not the hal.dll file, which is often times the case.<br>  <br>  # Write a new partition boot sector to the Windows XP system partition. If the partition boot sector has become corrupt or isn't properly configured, you may receive the hal.dll error.<br>  <br>  # Restore the hal.dll file from the Windows XP CD. If the hal.dll file is truly the cause of the problem, restoring it from the original Windows XP CD may do the trick.<br>  <br>  # Perform a repair installation of Windows XP. This type of installation should replace any missing or corrupt files. Continue troubleshooting if this does not resolve the issue.<br>  <br>  # Perform a clean installation of Windows XP. This type of installation will completely remove Windows XP from your PC and install it again from scratch.<br>  <br>  Note: While this will almost certainly resolve any hal.dll errors, it is a time consuming process due to the fact that all of your data must be backed up and then later restored.<br>  <br>  Important: If you can't gain access to your files to back them up, understand that you will lose them all if you continue with a clean installation of Windows XP.
ygDC4JFYaa	try it urself|`|AA11849917	Sorry, but this isn't a question.  You just "demanded" that someone write a program for you!<br>  <br>  I don't respond well to demands.<br>  <br>  But if this is a homework assignment, and if you need some assistance, you should ask nicely for help with your homework assignment, rather than demand that someone do it FOR you.<br>  <br>  Show us what you've done so far, and someone can assist you.<br>  <br>  But don't ask someone else to do your work FOR you, then turn it in as though you wrote it yourself - that's called "plagiarism" and cheating!

This is what gets MySpace a bad press and causes worry among parents of teens.<br>  Anybody who deletes their MySpace is sure to create another one somwhere down the line.

H5iVq0fwaa	my best brand is a sony vaio, esp series z. the only downside to it is:<br>  - windows 7<br>  - no touchscreen<br>  - expensive compared with other brands<br>  <br>  but i bought my second vaio about 4 years ago, and it is still in good working condition. i think what made it last is that it came with a system recovery disc which allows me to reformat and reinstall everything in less than an hour, without any fuss. i just put in the disc, and everything is really follow the directions. i also have no problems with its drivers and other softwares, as sony update their website. and they are easy to download and update.<br>  <br>  other series/ models have colorful choices, they even have an eye candy pink for series cs. then i think all vaios are think, slim and stylish, not bulky at all. then with their later models, sony has modified their keyboards so the buttons wont pop out as the case with many laptops.<br>  <br>  if you like cheapest brands, then go for an hp and a dell. my bad experience with these brands, well not really mine... but mostly from my friends who buy them from a sale:<br>  - drivers issues<br>  - software conflicts<br>  - bulky<br>  - warranty issues, read the fine print or keep the proof of purchase or process the warranty card<br>  - not well made<br>  - most are made with cheap shiny plastic material that easily bruise<br>  - metal materials are easily tarnished<br>  - windows os and drivers are not integrated in 1 disc, so reinstallation take forever, and you need to reactivate every time you reinstall windows. then in most case you cannot reinstall windows.<br>  <br>  after these 2 brands, acer, asus, toshiba, lenovo, etc. are not far behind.<br>  <br>  right now, i know that there are many cheap laptops on offer. this is because of the slumping economy and the phasing out of vista. it is still a wise decision to wait for windows 7, esp if you want to make your laptop last at least 4 years.<br>  <br>  then whatever you decide on, get at least with these items:<br>  - at least 2gb of ram<br>  - a fast processor<br>  - a fast video card<br>  - for the c drive you just need 40 to 60gb<br>  - for the d drive, whatever you like; but it is better if you have an external harddrive - this will make your pc run faster bec the media files will be stored here, rather than in your pc.<br>  - and dont forget to get the hardcopy of the systems recovery disc|`|GmSdBKQ9aa	follow this link<br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/home/laptops?~ck=mn" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/home/laptops?~ck=mn</a>|`|1iSmMo2Uaa	take a look here:<br>  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=Av1HNN1.O7vpJrU_SZgQLgQEgFoB?p=laptops&did=">http://shopping.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=Av...</a>

f4zg7LHLaa	they don't do anything. i have had trouble with ebay and harassing buyers/sellers. you report the messages, and then they send you an email telling you to send them the header of the email, which when you send it, never works, and THEN they have the cheek to send you a questionnaire about how they dealt with it!! i don't do ebay anymore. don't even get me started on paypal!!<br>  <br>  the amount of scammers on there is unreal....|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Well nearly all the items I buy are not delivered within a week! I've had this problem with an ebayer before, and when I reported her they contacted her and she got removed from ebay. The issue I had was I sold a moses basket rocking stand, it was brand new as i'd been bought two when Rylie was born. The box was damaged upon delivery, and she kept sending me abusive messages. The item was in perfect condition, it was just the box that was damaged!|`|GI27dKIkaa	Don't stand for it !  In addition to blocking his email address on your computer - contact HIS service provider (Yahoo, MSN, or whoever)<br>  <br>  File a complaint with them - they should (if they're concerned about their own reputation) contact the person and tell them to stop.<br>  <br>  Don't respond to any more of his emails.  In the UK - this also comes under harassment laws !  Keep copies of all the emails he sends you - and report it to the police !  They have vast resources at their disposal to trace this person to their home address !<br>  <br>  Everyone has a right to hassle-free surfing !|`|9163f6723559c34dd8054736b04c9f39aa	Report the buyer to ebay.  The buyer can file a complaint with ebay if he or she is not happy with the transaction.  Unless they specify what they want from you, they shouldn't be contacting you at all if they already received the product and are happy with the quality.<br>  <br>  Report them to ebay and make sure your communications are done via ebay messaging rather than direct email. That way, ebay can monitor the conversations and you have it officially on record.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7h5wxsL7aa	Ebay will only at best email them to comfirm that you have posted the item.  You should do what I do and get a receipt offf thr post office and photocopy it and send buyer a copy via a email.<br>  <br>  No complains and helps you will any hassle with the odd prat on Ebay.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	i dont think you have violated any laws in this case.<br>  <br>  obviously you sold ur stuff, u delivered it, transaction is done.<br>  <br>  so you dont have to worry about anything. you've done anything wrong, if he keep harrassing you, you can sue him.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	Yes they do.<br>  We had a similar problem and the other person got banned for a time (they couldn't tell us how long, but it was because he was harassing others at the time).<br>  You can ban them from bidding on your items but you'll have to go to the help section because I can't remember how to do it.<br>  Give eBay a chance to investigate the situation, it will take time because they have to contact the other person and wait for the to reply. If the buyer gave you positive feedback or non at all, don't worry too much. If they gave you negative you can post a response to it.|`|ibOcr3Deaa	The same thing happend to me. They claimed to have not even recieved my item though. <br>  We kept arguing for a few weeks and then they reported me to ebay. <br>  After a while I found out they had done this to other people and I complained untill my fingers were numb and got them kicked off ebay. <br>  I got them so angry that they admitted they had got the item. So i felt justice was done. <br>  <br>  In your case, I would keep complaining and dont give up. Ebay will soon sort you out. If its really upsetting, change your email or ask that they be blocked from contacting you through ebay mail. Ebay cannot monitor the actual mail sent between senders aparently. so you have to copy the email and source to ebay so that they can read the content . if you don't know how to do this they will tell you. once you complain.|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Yes they will you just have to give them time. Also you may be able to block him!! I'm not sure. They may remove him from the site or just lower his rating or threaten to do something else. IDK. but they will do SOMETHING you can be sure!!Ebays really good with that stuff :)|`|DtAyFqASaa	I got a web site that you can get things for FREE! It's called prize rebel!

(only for US, UK, Canada and Australia residents.)<br>  9. do an offer (around 1 point per offer, you have to read the description before u do the offer. if it says sign up to that offers web site, all u have to do is click the offer and sign up to that site.)<br>  <br>  Oh I recomend you do the phone missons, because you will get a lot of points!<br>  10. wait 0-24 hours for ur points to come.<br>  11. when you have done all the offers that u can do, click on the referral link on the side menu, u should get ur own referral url. send to friends and get them to sign up. now you get 20% of the points that they earn. (eg. if u refer Tom and Tom gets 10 points, u automatically get 2 points free!!!)<br>  Hope that was easy to understand and good luck!|`|NbmnWwqEaa	Yes, eBay will do something about it.<br>  They may ban the buyer . . . still, if he has your personal e-mail; you must stop him from sending you emails. i.e. changing e-mail address and leaving no forward address to him.|`|SkjujL6faa	Yes they send emails to the other person telling them that it has been dispatched withing the time limit, they can also get warnings and can be banned|`|v2ut95Wzaa	I don't know if they do anything but i would have thought they would have, if they don't just ignore they guy until he can't be bothered anymore, he will get bored and forget|`|fcdd9fac8bb073858a9e8651edeb4070aa	Block him|`|AA11756871	YOU CAN  PUT A BLOCK ON YOUR COMPUTER, WHICH WILL NOT ALLOW HIS EMAILS TO COME TO YOU <br>  IT WORKS

24MrT9Wuaa	The core interface of stacks is provided by the member functions push(), top(), and pop():<br>  ? push() inserts an element into the stack.<br>  ? top() returns the next element in the stack.<br>  ? pop() removes an element from the stack.<br>  <br>  10.1.2 Example of Using Stacks<br>  The following program demonstrates the use of class stack<>:<br>  // cont/stack1.cpp<br>  #include <iostream><br>  #include <stack><br>  using namespace std;<br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  stack<int> st;<br>  // push three elements into the stack<br>  st.push(l);<br>  st.push(2);<br>  st.push(3);<br>  // pop and print two elements from the stack<br>  cout << st.top() << ' ';<br>  st.pop() ;<br>  cout << st.top() << ' ';<br>  st.pop() ;<br>  // modify top element<br>  st.top() = 77;<br>  // push two new elements<br>  st.push(4);<br>  The C++ Standard Library<br>  dyne-book 381<br>  st.push(5);<br>  // pop one element without processing it<br>  st.pop() ;<br>  // pop and print remaining elements<br>  while (!st.empty()) {<br>  cout << st.top() << ' ';<br>  st.pop() ;<br>  }<br>  cout << endl;<br>  }<br>  The output of the program is as follows:<br>  3 2 4 77<br>  10.1.3 Class stack<> in Detail<br>  The stack<> interface is so small, you can understand it easily by reading its typical<br>  implementation:<br>  namespace std {<br>  template <class T, class Container = deque<T> ><br>  class stack {<br>  public:<br>  typedef typename Container::value_type value_type;<br>  typedef typename Container::size_type size_type;<br>  typedef Container container_type;<br>  protected:<br>  Container c; // container<br>  public:<br>  explicit stack(const Container& = Container());<br>  bool empty() const { return c.empty(); }<br>  size_type size() const { return c.size(); }<br>  void push (const value_type& x) { c.push_back(x); }<br>  void pop() { c.pop_back(); }<br>  value_type& top() { return c.back(); }<br>  const value_type& top() const { return c.back(); }<br>  };<br>  template <class T, class Container><br>  bool operator==(const stack<T, Container>&,<br>  const stack<T, Container>&);<br>  template <class T, class Container><br>  bool operator< (const stack<T, Container>&,<br>  const stack<T, Container>&);<br>  ...// (other comparison operators)<br>  }<br>  The following subsections describe the members and operations in detail.<br>  The C++ Standard Library<br>  dyne-book 382<br>  Type Definitions<br>  stack:: value_type<br>  ?

Creates an empty stack.<br>  explicit stack:: stack (const Container& cont)<br>  ? Creates a stack that is initialized by the elements of cont.<br>  ? All elements of cont are copied.<br>  size_type stack::size () const<br>  ? Returns the actual number of elements.<br>  ? To check whether the stack is empty (contains no elements), use empty() because it<br>  might be faster.<br>  bool stack::empty () const<br>  ?

Inserts a copy of elem as the new first element in the stack.<br>  value_type& stack::top ()<br>  const value_type& stack::top () const<br>  ? Both forms return the next element of the stack. The next element is the element that was<br>  inserted last (after all other elements in the stack).<br>  ? The caller has to ensure that the stack contains an element (size()>0); otherwise, the<br>  behavior is undefined.<br>  The C++ Standard Library<br>  dyne-book 383<br>  ? The first form for nonconstant stacks returns a reference. Thus, you could modify the next<br>  element while it is in the stack.

The next element is the element that was<br>  inserted last (after all other elements in the stack).<br>  ? This function has no return value. To process this next element, you must call top()<br>  first.<br>  ? The caller must ensure that the stack contains an element (size()>0); otherwise, the<br>  behavior is undefined.<br>  bool comparison (const stack&. stack1, const stack& stack2)<br>  ?

Two stacks are equal if they have the same number of elements and contain the same<br>  elements in the same order (all comparisons of two corresponding elements must yield<br>  true).<br>  ? To check whether a stack is less than another stack, the stacks are compared<br>  lexicographically. See the description of the lexicographical_compare() algorithm<br>  <br>  from:The c++ stl

There are no real disadvantages to using an LCD HDTV, but you do have to use them a bit differently since they are designed to be viewed from a further distance than a regular monitor--  You can't sit face-to-face with the bigger LCD TVs (30-inch diagonal or bigger) like you would a smaller computer monitor.<br>  <br>  I'm using a 52" LCD HDTV myself.

pDxFOekIaa	sounds like you may need a raid driver or something.  Sata needs drivers onstalled and enabled in bios<br>  <br>  when you do get going you need to create partition<br>  here is some good tips:<br>  <br>  consider this also<br>  Partition the Hard drive – reasons<br>  ========================<br>  Firstly C drive is compulsory for the Operating System (XP) (Vista), and you install all your programs on C drive.<br>  <br>  D drive is made for YOUR files.<br>  What you do is MOVE my documents to D drive.<br>  <br>  When you download music, videos, pictures from your camera or make any MS Office documents or save emails, you save it on D drive.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is to do with <br>  1. Hard drive failure - usually a failed hard drive will not boot, but can often be seen when hooked up as a slave.<br>  So when you get your new hard drive up and running, you can copy D drive from your old to your new. You haven’t lost anything.<br>  <br>  2. Virus. Normally virus are programmed to infect C drive. If you get a bad virus all that has to be done is format the C drive partition then re install you OS and programs from disks.<br>  You haven’t lost your personal stuff because its on D drive.<br>  <br>  3. Scanning your C drive for virus or spyware. These malware programs live on C drive. It is not necessary to scan D drive. It is a lot quicker to scan a small partition than a large hard drive.<br>  <br>  Now you can see the above is compromised by the fact that programs get updates and lots of programs are installed from the net. Therefore if you had to wipe out C drive it be hard to get it back to how it was.<br>  To remedy this we use Norton Ghost to image C drive and store the Image on D drive.<br>  (Vista requires a version 10 or newer of Ghost).<br>  <br>  If you get a bad virus you just use the Ghost disk to boot up on, then copy the image stored on D drive back over C drive.<br>  It takes less than 30 mins to rebuild C drive.<br>  Also you may have this running on say a 250 gig HDD, and it fails. You buy a new 400 gig HDD and install both into you computer, the failed one as a slave.<br>  Using the ghost disk to boot up on, you partition the 400 C drive to 30 gig (XP)and the remaining to D drive. Then you repack C drive from the image. Then Copy your old D drive files to your new one. In a time of less than 1 hour and it’s all running. The image loads all the drivers, OS everything.<br>  <br>  Then you update new images of C drive every few months so that the one stored on D drive is not to far out of date.<br>  <br>  On XP and Vista you create C drive to a maximum of (XP 30 gig, Vista 40 Gig) It doesn’t need to be any bigger, so don’t make C drive to big as you will not use it.<br>  All drives including external hdd should be in NTFS type file system.<br>  Type DISKPART in windows help file<br>  also Disk manager.<br>  click the desktop, hit Fn1 key.<br>  <br>  Vista:<br>  <a href="http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/19/how-t..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/19/how-t...</a>

There will be no viruses in there. Go your internet and install Avast! Anti-Virus. Also install Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware. Now restart your computer normally, and Avast will do the rest. After that, run the malware. Soon, your application will turn into trash with no icon. So you can just drag the application to your recycling bin. TADA!! :] <br>  <br>  P.S. If your using Internet Explorer, please don't, LOTS of viruses, I recommend you use Firefox. Go on on internet explorer, Google Mozilla Firefox and download it. Then now you have Firefox and you don't need to use internet explorer again.  But don't uninstall Internet Explorer, just in case.|`|eTLG23N4aa	You have rouge Malware on your computer.

jZ5MnD7Qaa	This can happen when the AC Adapter is going (dying) or if the laptop is trying to draw more current than what is available from the adapter. This causes a voltage drop and when the voltage drops below a certian limit, the laptop assumes the adapter is unplugged and goes to battery, once it goes to battery it stops drawing current from the adapter, whos voltages soon go back up and the laptop, currently drawing current from the battery, thinks the adapter is plugged back in and starts using it again.<br>  <br>  The cycle then repetes, except this time the battery is slightly discharged from the time the laptop was relying in it. So your icon will show a battery with a plug, saying Adapter is plugged in, then it goes just to battery (discharging) then goes back to battery with plug, and level going up (Power + Charging) then back to just battery (discharging) and so on.<br>  <br>  Unless your Adapter is repaired or replaced, this is likely to keep occurring.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :D|`|dILqe7nBaa	if you leave your battery in your laptop all the time it is going bad. or charger getting bad.you should remove your battery when you are using your ac charger ,and put your battery in when you will be needing it<br>  <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c01297640" rel="nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/docum...</a>

i56zRqYaaa	Your question is vague.<br>  <br>  My best guess to what you need is this:  You wish to create a compiled DLL for a few custom classes that you've written in an ASP.NET web application.  <br>  <br>  A few things to consider:  Make sure your project is a "web application" rather than a "website".  This makes a huge difference in .NET.  Web applications are compiled and will produce a DLL when built.  Also, are you trying to create a library?  Codebehind pages for a web application are all compiled into one main DLL.  If you have separate classes, extract them to a new project.  Build that project and reference the built DLLs in your web application.  <br>  <br>  I'm afraid that without more info, I can't provide anymore help.
Tdo2Mekbaa	I would go with the MacBook.  The recent update gave the MacBook White a much better graphics card and sped up the system.  I prefer the aluminum models, but the White is a very good computer.  OSX is much better than anything Microsoft has put out and viruses for Mac are rare.  You should get 4-5 hours of battery life out of the MacBook.  Sony has put out some very decent notebooks, but I think the Mac is the better choice in this case.

8ldmpevYaa	You most likely have been infected with a malware/virus -- I'm betting a drive-by kind (i.e: got injected into your system when you visited some site).<br>  <br>  Happened to me once even though I was running adware+antivirus shields on my system.<br>  <br>  The malware is now hijacking your google results and replacing the links with links to ad-sites.  Some of these malware also install a rootkit that masks the virus from adware scanners and less sophisticated antivirus software that are not smart enough to look for rootkits.  <br>  <br>  And if you're unlucky a whole variety of other viruses may have been installed as well.<br>  <br>  You might want to try some other antivirus software.  Ad-ware doesn't necessarily block all attacks.  Not sure if you've tried anything else.<br>  <br>  I rely on these ones usually (they can be downloaded for free):<br>  1) MalwareBytes (download from <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/)</a><br>  2) AVG (via <a href="http://free.avg.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/)</a><br>  3) Avast (<a href="http://www.avast.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/)</a><br>  <br>  They're pretty decent.  MalwareBytes has a rootkit scanner as well.  But the malwarebytes only runs on-demand in the free version (i.e: you have to run it explicitely).  So I also use AVG or Avast which have a antivirus shield in their free versions.<br>  <br>  If you're unable to visit these sites then that means the malware is blocking the sites -- some of these malware are smart enough to block anti-virus sites, microsoft update sites, etc.  In which case you'll have to find 3rd party sites that might have download links for these antivirus software.<br>  <br>  Or you can try less well known antivirus software.  <br>  E.g: Normal Virus Cleaner <br>  -- its not as well known so it might not be blocked by the malware on your machine.  You can download it from here:<br>  <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/Norman-Malware-Cleaner.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/N...</a><br>  <br>  Run the virus scanner of your choice and follow the instructions.  <br>  <br>  I recommend that you unplug the machine from the network during the cleaning process.  In the case where you have a family of viruses, you might remove a few on the initial scan but they will be downloaded and reinstalled again if you're connected to the network.<br>  <br>  If you're having problems running the scanners normally (e.g: you launch the program but nothing shows up on the screen even after say 10 min)  then that might be cause the malware is also blocking the main antivirus software from running on your machine.  Again, the Norman Cleaner is usually immune from this problem cause its not as well known.<br>  <br>  If you're having issues running in normal mode then try running the antivirus software while in safe-mode.  To enter safe-mode: reboot your machine and press F8 as it boots up.<br>  <br>  If after all that you're still having problems then you might have to find some other cleaners/antivirus tools to do the job or you might have to wipe your machine clean and reinstall everything.<br>  <br>  If the scanners are able to clean it then make sure you run two or three different scanners to make sure that you clean out all possible remnants of the viruses -- no single scanner is guaranteed to clean everything as I've found.<br>  <br>  In the event that a rootkit virus is on your machine -- the key is to get rid of the rootkit virus ASAP.  That should then unmask the other virus files which the scanners can pick up.<br>  <br>  The above is based on my experience and what worked for me.  Though it took 2 weeks to clean everything out. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	It does that to me sometimes too, i really don't know what its from?

P1XfUB9Haa	There is no RAID configuration that uses only 1 disk.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	The purpose of RAID is not always performance. RAID is used to create redundancies in file systems so they can more easily be recovered in the event of a drive failure.<br>  <br>  Some RAID configurations are designed for performance, but they're not the levels of RAID routinely used on PCs. <br>  <br>  In your case, you might be interested in RAID1 with is mirroring. This requires two disks, preferably of identical size. The data one one disk is automatically mirrored to the second, so that if the first disk fails, you can break the RAID and use the second disk until the dead disk can be replaced and the RAID rebuilt.<br>  <br>  You would not use RAID on a single disk.|`|I4TLCFf7aa	To run a RAID array you need at least two hard drives.  If you are only running one drive, then set the SATA controllers to IDE/PATA.
jZ5MnD7Qaa	Make sure your vents are not blocked and the laptop is on a flat surface. Also make sure the rubber pads under the laptop are intact and there is a gap between the vent and the surface the laptop is sitting on.<br>  <br>  If those all check out ok, make sure the vents are not clogged with dirt or dust.<br>  <br>  You can blow into the vent to try and clear it out, but if the fan is failing then you will need to get that replaced.<br>  <br>  It's hard to tell when a fan is failing if it isnt making a funny noise or has stopped completly.<br>  <br>  My advice is to, make sure nothing is blocking the vents outside the laptop, then make sure nothing inside is blocking the airflow, and if those check out then your fan might be to blame.<br>  <br>  If your idle temps are between 40C and 50C, and your load temps no higher than 70C you are ok.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	If it has a fan, verify that the fan is turning at a reasonable speed.  Check that any ventilation openings are unobstructed and free of dust.<br>  <br>  If the notebook still heats up after verifying these things, it may simply be that the design of the notebook isn't very good at shedding heat.  If the notebook continues to run, you can just try to live with the heat; if it overheats so much that it stops, you'll have to stop doing whatever things cause it to heat up so much (such as games, etc.), or risk damage to the notebook.

h0hSIgC1aa	Do you mean the power supplies that do not have the selector switch?<br>  <br>  Most units that have "Active PFC" or "active power factor correction" include a circuit that compensates for the "real" power the unit does not have.  Without going into a whole deal of electrical theory, it simply means it will counteract the internal inductance and capacitance of the unit.<br>  <br>  One advantage of this circuit, it can detect your input voltage before it goes past the primary stage, aka voltage "auto detect", and will perform the switching for you within the PFC circuit stage.<br>  <br>  This is very over-simplified, I hope it explains it.<br>  <br>  <br>  cheers|`|8YVo2Wogaa	It will be a switched mode power supply.<br>  These power supplies will turn any input voltage into the right output, within some limits though.<br>  <br>  See here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_mode_power_supply" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched_mo...</a><br>  if you want to know more!|`|jZ5MnD7Qaa	In most Switchmode Power Supply units, there is two things that can happen.<br>  <br>  1: There is a switch on the back, if it's set to 120 volts, the AC runs first through a voltage doubler to bring it to 240, then that gets rectified and goes to the chopper, and the transformer, ect..<br>  <br>  If the switch is set to 240, the AC gets rectified to DC and then goes right to the chopper circuit without any doubling.<br>  <br>  This is why when using 120 AC you should never put the switch to 240, as the driving circuits will only be getting half of what they need! Under voltage is just as bad as over voltage.<br>  <br>  This is also why, if you are in Europe and using 240, you should never put the switch to 120, because the 240 will get doubled to 480 volts! And if the driving circuits dont fry, the output voltages will be anyones guess!<br>  <br>  2: There is no switch and the driving circuit input voltage can be 120 to 240, because the output voltages are stricly regulated and are fixed regardless of input voltages (as long as they are within a safe range).<br>  <br>  Most Switch Mode Power supplies that have the switch will have two large smoothing capicitors, these are used with large diodes to form a simple voltage doubler.<br>  <br>  I hope this clears that up!

Then restart the computer in safe mode (as the computer is starting keep tapping the F8 key) select start in safe mode and wait till it loads.

FBQZ06vraa	In general, you can't get into their machine without hacking software.  Here are some steps you can take to get them off your network, though.  <br>  <br>  Because routers differ as to details, I can't be specific about how to accomplish these steps, but they're almost all done from within the router's administration web pages. Note: It’s best to do them from a computer cabled (even just temporarily) to the router rather than wirelessly, especially since wireless administration will be deactivated by step #1.<br>  <br>  Generally, to access your router’s administration pages, hook up a computer directly to the router and enter the router’s local IP address into a browser’s address window.  See way below for details on finding your router's IP address.<br>  <br>  1. Deactivate wireless access to your router's administration web pages so only a computer connected via an Ethernet cable can reach them.  This won’t affect wireless use of the Internet, just wireless administration of the router. Even if you don’t want to leave a computer connected via a cable, leave the cable there for when you need it.  <br>  2. Turn off the SSID (network name) broadcast from the router.  There's no need to advertise your network's presence.  You're not running a hotspot; everyone who should be on your network should know its name.<br>  3. Change your SSID from the default.  Hackers know that routers come with default SSIDs and look for them.<br>  4. Set up encryption with an encryption key.  The longer, the better. WPA (if your network and all your computers can support 802.11G) is better than WEP.  WEP is better than nothing.<br>  5. Limit access to only the computers you want on the network via MAC filtering. (MAC refers to unique NIC (Network Interface Card) addresses, not Macintosh computers, and not IP addresses.)  This isn't a defense against hardcore freeloaders -- it's possible to fake MAC addresses -- but it keeps out casual interlopers.<br>  6. Change the range of and/or limit the number of automatically assigned IP addresses (DHCP) to reduce the chance of extra users.  Again, hackers know what ranges routers come from the factory with.  Changing them makes it a little harder to hop on board.<br>  <br>  Here’s how to find your router’s IP address:<br>  <br>  1. Click on the Start->Run button.<br>  2. In the text box, type<br>  <br>  cmd<br>  <br>  and press Enter.<br>  3. A black "DOS box" will pop up.  In it, enter<br>  <br>  ipconfig /all<br>  <br>  A bunch of gibberish will fill the box.  Next to "Default Gateway" an IP address will appear.  This is your router's IP address. <br>  <br>  That should go far toward hardening your wireless network.|`|QZSLlAaDaa	Instead of going into their computer (which is illegal by the way), why not just put a password on your router? It's not hard, just open a browser window and type in the IP of your router's admin page (it's with your original router manual or you can probably go to the manufacturers website to find it). From there just follow the instructions. Each brand has a different procedure so I can't really tell you what it is in this forum.<br>  Good Luck!|`|1217200f8a7bd6b46b73eeb9ce169cbdaa	You must mean your wireless network. Logon to your router, and set up the security so they can't.As far as accessing there computer, that's what passwords are for. You can't even access your own, without knowing your password. The only way they can access your network, is if you have the  security disabled on your router. And if there are plugged into your network physically, tell them to pay half the bill and shut the hell up!|`|iAXI9gmTaa	-if you have a wireless router and you dont have idea about wireless security and IP ranging, its hard to explain.
ysiE6IDjaa	Well the three things to look at are <br>  <br>  RAM (you have 512MB minimum, the mimimum requirements are also 512MB )<br>  Processor speed (you have 1.6, the minimum requirement a 1.5 GHz processor, so you just scrape by)<br>  Graphics card.<br>  <br>  The graphics are where your machine falls down.

Tdo2Mekbaa	Many of the netbooks on the market today offer very similar specs (unless you go to the higher-end models).  You should look for a model that has a keyboard that is big enough to type on comfortably.  For other specs, you should look for 1.5-2 GHz processor, 1GB memory, and at least 60GB hard drive.  Check out the HP Mini 1000 and the Asus Eee PC 1000HE.  They should run you about $360-380.

You need at least 2 and 4 if possible. But I recommend buying a brand new computer with RAM and Video card upgrades, saves money in the future and I think is a good investment. Most people don't have the money for it but if you do, you should totally go for it. Delete Norton Antivirus and get Avast or AVG, Norton has many bugs that can cause a computer to be constantly slow. <br>  <br>  Manage your start-up programs also, they can cause your computer to be very sluggish at first. And try looking in Task Manager to see if there are any processes taking alot/excessive memory. If you happen to find the process, google it and find ways to disable the process (if it isn't a windows component).|`|KsUXv6D2aa	To fix a slow computer you can go to <a href="http://www.regcleandownload.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.regcleandownload.com</a> <br>  Download reg clean for free.<br>  It can clean your computer and restore your system to optimum performance.<br>  It works very well for me.<br>  Hope that can help you.|`|2RS1dNqFaa	What you could try to do is run a memory diagnostic test while booting.<br>  Or you could just try reseating the RAM...that might help.<br>  Your processor is really old though...that might be the problem.

The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>

Of course that may be plenty of space, but you may want more later and not have the money to upgrade.<br>  <br>  Bandwidth - This is crucial, if you use up to much, then your site can't be viewed until next month starts again.

Don't be fooled. Google for a converter to see actual space number in another unit.<br>  <br>  I can suggest you a nice web host that seems to just started.

No these days its cheap. UK only virgin media provides cable connection. If you live in an area where this is not available you will need to get a phone line with a broadband connection. I suggest you go for BT phone line its not expensive at all and It will let you have wide range broadband connections at your home. <br>  If you are a monthly customer of O2 you can also get a discount if you buy broadband from them. I phoned them when I was about to finish my contract and they gave me 1 year free broadband but normally it won't cost more than 7.50 if you are a member and that is 8MB. Also look for other broadband providers if you don't like O2. <br>  <br>  Check this website out:<br>  <a href="http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/consumerProducts/displayCategory.do?categoryId=CON-HOME-PHN-R1&s_intcid=con_intban_overview_calls_home" rel="nofollow">http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/co...</a><br>  <br>  It shows you different phone line costs.

If you want a contracted program choose the second one which will give you evening free as well.<br>  <br>  So 10 + 7.50 = comes to around 18 pounds with phone + broadbrand giving you free calls as well.<br>  <br>  If you need further help do ask.|`|AA12180741	well mobile broadband would the only real way to go unless you pay for sat internet but that can get really expensive. <br>  <a href="http://www.satsig.net/ivsat-europe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.satsig.net/ivsat-europe.htm</a> or just pay the ￡100 and you can get adsl service, the ￡100 is possible a reconnection fee to put your line back onto the exchange, am sure if you choose BT internet, the price might come way down for reconnection.|`|NEkssyeAaa	O2 Broad band, is one of the best.

XmnVJxzaaa	After looking over the specifications for your computer, I'm sorry to tell you, but you will not be able to upgrade the video card for your computer. The VGC-JS1E is an all-in-one computer/monitor and has no room for any kind of video card. Also, there are no expansion slots to put a video card, or any other type of card, into your computer.<br>  The video card that is in your system now isn't really a video card. It is just the graphics processor from a video card. And that graphics processor is built into a chip (called the northbridge chip) that is permanently soldered onto the motherboard and can not be changed. <br>  In a situation like yours, where the graphics processor is built into the motherboard, the only way to upgrade the graphics is to upgrade the entire motherboard and that is terribly expensive. Your computer uses a proprietary motherboard, meaning it is a special size and shape made only for your computer. In order for you to change the motherboard, you would be beholden to Sony to sell you one. And getting parts directly from Sony is pricey.<br>  Just so I'm not telling you it can't be done and leaving it at that, I've checked and found that Sony offered these models:<br>  VGC-JS2E/G<br>  VGC-JS2E/P<br>  VGC-JS2E/Q<br>  VGC-JS2E/S<br>  that are similar to your computer, but with better graphics built onto the motherboard. Those models came with the NVIDIA? GeForce? 9300M GS* graphics processors. This graphics processor is an improvement over the graphics processor in your computer. And because they are similar computers, the motherboard from one should swap directly into the other. You'd have to call Sony (or try an authorized Sony service center in your area) and have them see how much it would cost to order the motherboard for one of the model numbers I list above. <br>  A decent video card would have cost you anywhere from $100 to $600 US dollars. I don't know how much a new motherboard would be, but you can keep the video card prices in your head when deciding whether a whole new motherboard is worth it. And as a person above suggested, it may be best to have a technician install the new motherboard.<br>  I wish I had better news. I'm sorry. I just don't want to see someone say, "Hey, get one of these!" and have you disappointed when you find not only is there no slot to put the card in, but the card wouldn't fit in the case if there were. I also don't like leaving serious people with a simple, "You can't do it. Buy a new computer." That seems so fatalistic. <br>  I hope I was of at least some help. If you need more help, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.<br>  Good luck.|`|uahInjMdaa	That model comes with integrated graphics. You CANNOT upgrade the graphics card at all.|`|Z2rxLctiaa	You should call a technician to install your card.|`|0XVLsJTLaa	if u dont no much about computer get ur bro if he can do it.<br>  <br>  it is easy peasy but ur probably not sure how to do it.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!!

It can only detect virus infections correctly by having the most up to date virus signature or virus definition files installed (using the Norton update subscription service). Norton AV works by scanning your systems files & looking for patterns inside the files for patterns that match those in the virus signature files. If the patterns match a virus is thus detected.<br>  <br>  No.2 NOTE:- Trojan Horse Infections are NOT viruses and this confuses ALOT of computer users.<br>  <br>  No.3 Trojan Horse infections are parasites & they DON'T behave anything like viruses and so AV software frequently wont detect them at all or miss identify them.<br>  <br>  No.4 To correctly detect Trojan Horse infections you need special dedicated tools (scanners) such as SpyBot Search & Destroy or A2Squared Free, or HiJack this, or Trojan Hunter (free trial).<br>  <br>  SEE:-<a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/</a><br>  <br>  SEE:-<a href="http://www.emsisoft.com/en/software/free/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emsisoft.com/en/software/free...</a><br>  <br>  SEE:- <a href="http://www.misec.net/trojanhunter/" rel="nofollow">http://www.misec.net/trojanhunter/</a><br>  <br>  No.5 NOTE: each type of computer parasite or infection requires the correct kind of tools to detect them & safely remove them.

Have your folks go into the Apple Store and feel the new MBPro - they are pretty tough!|`|0BOxZ5Ecaa	if you drop most any laptop it is history. it's just that with an apple the cost of repair/replacement is double to triple what a windows based machine. my advice is that if you are a klutz and always dropping things it might be adviseable to buy a cheaper machine so when you do drop it and destroy it you can replace it and won't have to do without cause your parents put their foot down and say "i told you so". if on the other hand you take good care of your stuff and don't drop things accidently as you kids are so fond of saying when you are careless and something gets damaged/destroyed. by all means buy a macbook buy at least offer your parents to make up the difference between a apple and a p/c. i found with our children that if they put their hard earned dollars into something they tended to take better care of it.  and i'm sure you have no problem accepting the high cost of a apple as long as it's your parents money .|`|agNhphW6aa	If you take care of it , keep it clean of viruses, malware, spyware, defragged, spam, bots, etc.  keep it dust free and use a carrying case you should be fine.<br>  <br>  YOu already know mac software so why not? if you can afford it, fire away!|`|kQAS7eaBaa	depends on what you are going to use it for and if you'r going to use it all the time then itll be worth the money.
6GB5P7ojaa	It's quite simple: Netbooks are indeed smaller than notebooks; we usually say that a netbook can have a screen up to 10 inches from corner to corner. Netbooks are cheap and have relatively slow processors, but this is because they are designed for more basic tasks.<br>  <br>  You'll also find that netbooks don't have optical drives. They sometimes have Solid State Drives (SSDs) instead of Hard Disk Drives, which are lower capacity but have no moving parts and should, in theory, increase battery life and speed. The last difference is that most netbooks can run either Linux or Windows XP.<br>  <br>  A laptop (also called a notebook) is computer which has been designed to be made portable, featuring a screen hinged to a keyboard. A laptop includes a battery for portable power and a touchpad instead of a mouse for input.<br>  <br>  Mini laptops (also called a netbook, subnotebook or ultraportables) take these ideas further still, creating a new market above handheld computers, smartphones and personal digital assistants. The primary characteristic of these are smaller size and weight, which are pretty similar to the average diary, as well as costing less than a standard laptop with prices starting at around ￡150, an excellent solution during the credit crunch!<br>  <br>  Mini laptops aren't as powerful as bigger notebook computers, and lack the power for big, demanding programs as well as an optical disc drive - so no CDs or DVDs. None the less, connectivity is a central focus for netbooks. Internet downloads are quickly catching up on hard media products, so perhaps it's not such a loss.<br>  <br>  In short, the difference between laptop and netbook is a netbook is smaller, lighter, cheaper (on the whole) and simpler.|`|Z2rxLctiaa	Netbook is specialized in connectivity.But Laptop is overall good.If you buy,go for Laptop.|`|Tdo2Mekbaa	A netbook is basically a  much smaller and stripped-down version of a laptop.  Netbooks (usually) offer greater portability at the cost of slower processors, less memory, smaller hard drives, smaller screens and keyboards, and the lack of an optical drive.  For these reasons, netbooks are generally cheaper than laptops.

jZ5MnD7Qaa	To understand Triple Channel, lets go back to regular RAM, like SDRAM.<br>  <br>  Lets say we have an SDRAM chip thats clocked at 200Mhz, this is pretty fine for back when SDRAM was around.<br>  <br>  Now lets say we have a DDR stick thats clocked at 100Mhz, but is labeled as 200Mhz. <br>  <br>  This means that the DDR is sending data on the rising AND falling edge of the clock cycle, so it's doing twice as much each clock cycle compared to the old SDRAM.<br>  <br>  When DDR2 came around, they doubled it yet again, even if the clock cycle was 200Mhz, they were sending 4 times as much each clock cycle than SDRAM. Or twice as much as DDR (thus the '2' in DDR2).<br>  <br>  When DDR3 came around, they send even more! Why are they doing it this way instead of increasing the actual operating frequency? The answer is, it's not that easy. It's not impossible, but the cost of a RAM chip costs more as the clock frequency goes up. But, the RAM speed has to be as close to the CPU speed as possible or the CPU is going to sit around waiting for the data from the RAM. As you can imagine, this is a problem.<br>  <br>  So how do you make the speed of the RAM go up, to keep up with the CPU's Frequency (which keeps getting higher these days) without increasing the acutal frequency?<br>  <br>  You send more per clock cycle! Thats why it's called double data rate or DDR.<br>  <br>  Check out this Wiki article on Dual Channel and it will help you more understand Triple Channel. --> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-channel_architecture" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-channe...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: Ok, three memory sticks would normally share the same channel to talk to the CPU, this means when one is talking the others have to wait. Dual Channel lets two talk at once without waiting, three means that three can talk at the same time without waiting.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)

9eae15fd25d6b9552deee228486e0aaaaa	What you are looking for is called a 'Javascript Redirect'.<br>  <br>  Heres a good example of a direct redirect, and a time delayed redirect.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascriptredirect.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascr...</a>|`|Pm6rM9e2aa	just insert this line in your html code, if you can after your HEAD TAG<br>  <br>  <META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT="0; URL=http://YourNewPage_location.com">|`|LlnMzKp7aa	~~~ Codes: ~~~<br>  <br>  # 1 - Meta<br>  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://www.testsite.com/"><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  # 2 - JavaScript<br>  <script type="text/javascript"><br>  <!--<br>  setTimeout(<br>  "window.location='http://test.com';"<br>  ,0);<br>  //--><br>  </script><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  # 3 - PHP<br>  <?php<br>  header("Location: <a href="http://www.testsite.com/");" rel="nofollow">http://www.testsite.com/");</a><br>  ?><br>  <br>  ~~~ Detailed Explanations: ~~~<br>  <br>  So far, I know three ways how to redirect visitors to another page...<br>  <br>  1. The easiest and simplest way is by using the HTML's meta tag(, but visitors can disable "META Refresh" on their browser's settings and this won't work!):<br>  Syntax (Note: this MUST be placed inside the <head></head>tags to be a valid HTML, if you care...):<br>  <br>  <meta<br>  http-equiv="refresh"<br>  content="SecondsB4Redirect; url=RedirectToUrl"><br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=http://www.testsite.com/"><br>  <br>  *******************<br>  <br>  2. More complicated and a much less effective way is to use JavaScript (if visitors disabled JavaScript in their browser, this script won't work at all!). I had to add line-breaks to the script because Yahoo!'s filtering it, but it should still work since JavaScript ignores "white-spaces" and line-breaks! Also, be careful because JavaScript IS case-sensitive:<br>  <br>  Syntax (can be placed in either inside the <head></head> or the <body></body> tags, but when placed inside the <head></head> it will load earlier):<br>  <br>  <script type="text/javascript"><br>  <!-- Hide script from older browsers with HTML+JS comment tag/block<br>  <br>  setTimeout(<br>  "window.location='Redirect2';"<br>  ,MilliSecondsBeforeRedirect);<br>  <br>  //--><br>  </script><br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  <script type="text/javascript"><br>  <!--<br>  <br>  setTimeout(<br>  "window.location='http://test.com';"<br>  ,0);<br>  <br>  //--><br>  </script><br>  <br>  *******************<br>  <br>  3. Finally, the PERFECT (because visitors can't disable the method nor can they see a glimpse of the old page--in other words, it's faster than 0 millisecond/second!), but the hardest (for non-developers) and limited way to redirect visitors is by using "server-side redirects." This is only if you have the control over your web site's server, the server supports server-side scripts, and (you have) the knowledge to code server-side scripts such as PHP. Anyways, if you know all of these then I can give you this perfect example of PHP script to use (Normally, the header() function must go before anything else [before <!DOCTYPE ...> <html>.... etc...]):<br>  <br>  <?php<br>  <br>  header("Location: <a href="http://www.testsite.com/");" rel="nofollow">http://www.testsite.com/");</a><br>  <br>  ?><br>  <br>  Pick and use one (or more) that works for you and good luck! Hope it helps, and sorry if I give out too much of unnecessary information... xD

ySKsOfIMaa	Many good folks will tell you to go with XP over Vista, and I can't say I disagree with them - it's heavier on your system's resources than a full-grown elephant on a diet of cake and pie. However, if you have a machine to handle it (4GB+ of RAM), it becomes a simple matter of preference - I run a machine with 4GB of RAM and Vista Ultimate 64-bit, and even in games it never chokes. These aren't last gen's games, either - this is fairly system-heavy stuff like Assassin's Creed, Mass Effect, Fallout 3, Need for Speed: Undercover, and Mirror's Edge, all running at full details and a resolution of 1680x1050.<br>  <br>  Rumors about Vista's epic levels of instability also linger, but I can tell you from several months of using it, I've only had it blue screen once - while I was playing with my CPU's clock settings. I turned it up too high for the voltage and tried to run it flat-out at 100%.<br>  <br>  There's also the issues with hardware and driver compatibility, which I won't disagree with. However, you're building a new computer that will likely be using parts that, by now, have been tested to work fine in Vista. Most reputable brands have also had time to tweak their hardware drivers to make them stable under Vista.<br>  <br>  Vista also has DirectX 10, which does improve visuals. However, it's arguable whether they are improved enough to make it worth running Vista. See <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/directx-9-vs-directx-10-worth-upgrading-to-vista-for-243099.php" rel="nofollow">http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/directx-9...</a> for actual side-by-side screenshots with games using DX9 and 10, and decide for yourself.<br>  <br>  The Linux community in general would frown on you using Vista, of course, but many would frown on you for using a Microsoft product period. This is coming from someone who uses Ubuntu and Vista on a regular basis, and has also used XP, 2000, openSuSE, Fedora Core, Gentoo, and CrunchBang - you'll catch flak just for having the Microsoft logo on your hard drive.<br>  <br>  Again, it basically comes down to preference now that Vista SP1 is out. If you want DX10, a shiny interface, and have a pretty beefy machine, go with Vista. If you want a more no-frills experience or have a machine that's a bit lacking, go with XP.<br>  <br>  If, however, you are going 64-bit, I would highly recommend Vista. There is a 64-bit Version of XP, but it has a very thrown-together-at-the-last-second feel. Some manufacturers and publishers also do not support it because it never really gained popularity.|`|Htgj1LL6aa	i think the ubuntu community would frown on you for getting vista.<br>  windows xp uses much less resources than vista, meaning more for your games. it also does not support directx 10.  not officially anyways. some people have manged to get xp working with dx10. but really it isnt going to matter, dx10 has very little advantage over 9.0.but when we get around to utilizing 10 to full potential, we might see real results that we are not now.|`|WoGlYBejaa	I recommend Microsoft Windows XP. <br>  <br>  Although Vista has better security system, it also has a lot of bugs and driver compatibility.|`|omNEQ4Tkaa	don't be fooled vista is awesome i have xfx 790i sli ultra, duo E8500, 4gig ram, and 9800gt would not trade vista for anything|`|ofEb1uRLaa	Windows XP is the best OS out there.

There should be an application called 'Photo Booth' (it looks like a little booth with a red curtain). Click on that.

Tdo2Mekbaa	Apple recently started a push to make all of its operations more Earth-friendly.  So, they've cut down on shipping and boxing materials.  They've even stopped using shopping bags in their stores.  Their biggest changes, however, have come in their actual products.  Most computers are made using materials that cannot be recycled and chemicals that are harmful for the environment.  Apple is trying to stop this trend by creating computers from fully recyclable materials and by avoiding the use of any harmful chemicals in their computers.  They've also made their products more energy efficient.|`|hErzvFReaa	I suppose they made it recyclable to help the environment.

In this case though, "colour" tv is designated as that which makes use of the 3 primary colours (red, green, blue) rather than producing only a greyscale image.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	color tv theory is the following:<br>  <br>  3 rays of lights in different colors (namely, yellow, red, blue or green red blue, i forgot exactly what they are), shoot out from transistors and then end up on your screen, to mix up different colors, since either yellow red blue or green red blue can form any other colors in the world an eye can see. so yea thats ur answer.|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	Actually Black is the absence of any color and White is the presents of all color.<br>  <br>  A black and white TV set can only register degrees of shade between full black and full white (known as the Gray Scale).

jZ5MnD7Qaa	Most 90nm Processors and lower SHOULD NEVER go over 90C, and most laptops and desktops will shutdown when they reach 100C.<br>  <br>  So, 80C, while not in the danger zone, is not good either because the warmer a CPU, the lower the lifetime. <br>  <br>  CPUs and other chips based on silicone do not last forever, the tiny wires of metal inside evaporate and reform in other places. This is called electromigration, and when the metal evaporates from one spot, it might cut a wire in two, and then reform somewhere else causing a short across two or more other wires!<br>  <br>  As you can imageine, this isnt good! However, this process takes a long time, but the warmer your CPU the faster this happens. Thus a cooler CPU lasts longer than a warmer one.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is, clean out your vents and cooling fan, make sure the laptop is on a flat surface and the rubber pads on the bottom are intact so the vents get the air they need and are not blocked.<br>  <br>  Get your idle temps to around 40 C - 50 C and your load temps to around 60 C - 70 C and you are ok.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|bYjU3YBbaa	That's pretty hot... I don't think it would really be that hot because that sounds like melting point of your laptop to me...|`|malbVcasaa	That is a bit on the warm side, but CoreTemp may not be reading your temperatures accurately.  Some motherboards don't report temperature in a way that CoreTemp can predict, so it give values that are a little high.  If you go into your BIOS, it should report the true temperature. <br>  <br>  Most computers will shut themselves down if they get above 75 or so.  As a rule of thumb, you're not going to destroy anything if you're under 100C.  If it's too hot to use on your lap, then it's too hot.|`|2XPzEXCNaa	My laptop gets super hot sometimes.<br>  I now have a laptop fan that sits underneath the laptop and fans the vents at the bottom.

9UYulfF7aa	It probably IS overheating.<br>  You probably have dust trapped inside it... It probably happens during games because the computer is working harder, and the fact that it's plugged in will also heat it up a lot more.

hXHBm1BSaa	The part of the drive set aside and formatted to keep the operating system and boot files. This normally refers to your c: drive, but could be any other letter, which is why the term system drive is often used instead of  "drive  C:"|`|8x7VkHhIaa	In Microsoft Windows, the system partition and boot partition refer to:<br>  <br>  The system partition is a disk partition that contains the boot sector and files such as NTLDR that are needed for booting Windows XP and earlier. (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 use a newer boot loader called bootmgr that replaces NTLDR and is configured using BCDEdit.exe). <br>  The boot partition is the disk partition that contains the Windows operating system files and its support files, but obtusely, not any files responsible for booting. <br>  The system partition can be different from the boot partition, although they are often on the same partition (drive C:). Windows setup places the initial system partition based on motherboard BIOS settings. Bitlocker requires a separate, unencrypted system partition for booting.<br>  <br>  The master boot record is located at physical sector 0, just before the partition table, and is therefore not contained inside any of the logical partitions or volumes.|`|CXH8yOiraa	The amount of hard drive space that you reserve for your operating system.<br>  Basically you can divide your hard drive into sections. If you have a 100GB HDD, you can partition it to smaller sections. So we can partition 20 GB of it for windows vista, and the remaining will be for data files, movies, games, and all that kinda stuff. <br>  So if you go to "my computer" you will see C: is 20GB, which is where vista is installed, and D: which is the remaining 80GB.<br>  This allows for better performance of the HD.
xERzGZ6Baa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5. Clean your Registry<br>  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!<br>  Use the tool:  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a><br>  Learn more information "why is my computer running so slow": <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Probably the best you can do apart from reinstalling the OS is to uninstall all software that you don't use.  Uninstall Norton if you have it, it's a sad joke of an AV program that slows everything down.  Run MSCONFIG and tell it not to start anything at boot time that doesn't need it.  Download CCleaner, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and a new AV program if you got rid of Norton and run them to clear up junk/malware.  Vista will run ok if you look after it, like with XP.  Defragment your hard drive after doing the other tasks.<br>  <br>  Ccleaner:  (Don't forget to do both junk files and registry scans)<br>  <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br>  <br>  Malwarebytes:  (Update this program before running it to get the latest definitions)<br>  <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" rel="nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br>  <br>  Avast AV: (Use the home edition, it's free)<br>  <a href="http://avast.com/" rel="nofollow">http://avast.com/</a><br>  <br>  EDIT:  You don't need to replace your drive - any 1TB drive is new enough that it's fast.  Besides, Windows DOES NOT read the whole drive when it starts so it doesn't matter how big the drive is.  If uninstalling useless programs, disabling stupid startup programs, cleaning the registry, zapping malware and exterminating Norton doesn't speed it up then either there's a problem with the OS or it's infected with undetected malware.  If you can't cure it then you should consider reinstalling the operating system since a clean install should run well, so long as you don't re-infect it when you reinstall your software - scan it all.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	There is something seriously wrong if it's taking that long to start up. The problem is NOT your hardware as those specs are amazing. The computer doesn't read the whole harddrive when it starts up, it should make no difference whether you have a 100GB drive or 1000GB! Maybe it's your virtual memory settings? If you have no joy with those, try reinstalling Windows.<br>  <br>  Just for comparison I have an Athlon 64 3200+, 1GB RAM, and 200GB hard drive, and Windows XP starts up in less than 30 seconds.|`|jZ5MnD7Qaa	Your problem is most likey caused by Windows relying on the page file too much. Remember the Page File is a file on the hard drive that windows treats like RAM.<br>  <br>  The Fastest Hard Drive on the planet is still SLOWER than the slowest RAM on the planet!<br>  <br>  Now, you said you have 2 GB of RAM, if you want windows to use the page file less then you need to reduce the size of the page file itself!<br>  <br>  To do this: Go to desktop and right click Computer and click Properties, then click on the Advanced System Settings, and then click on Settings button in the Performance section, then click the Advanced tab and then click Change button under the Virtual Memory section.<br>  <br>  The size should be about the same as the RAM you have plus about 512MB.|`|Fk3TupqVaa	Most computer users have been trained that if you want more speed for your computer, then add more memory. Well, this is true, in certain circumstances. But for most of the times, it really is just bad files in your registry files. Corrupted or missing registry files can make your computer too slow.<br>  The registry is a main part of your computer's Operating System. With time, as you use Windows and install and uninstall programs, your registry will get congested and full of errors. So your computer could slow down. So, if you can clean it up this problem can be solved.Sometimes you can speed computer up by 300%. To clean up registry,You can download a software called regsitry cleaner---Clean registry,remnant,corrupt files and temp files,history,cookies,etc..

9wwpTMYraa	Depends really what you are looking for.<br>  I have two printers at home. One I bought around 70 pounds. Its samsung ML2850D. The reason why I bought this one was that it prints fast and its laser. 24 pages a minute.Also you can set it up so that it prints on both sides of paper. Its a duplex printer. One of the reasons for me to buy it. It was expensive but worth it. Its black and white only.<br>  <br>  Another printer I have is color one and its cheap 25 pounds. Canon Pixma MP190. Its not laser so not as fast and won't last long will have to change cartriages but its cheap and It prints color. Also it has built in photocopier for both color and black and white and its a scanner too. Pretty good for the price.<br>  <br>  Just do your research and buy the printer. Brand doesn't really make a difference as long as they give you the warranty and printer does the job you want it to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	i have an epson stylus photo rx520 and find it excellent .<br>                   it<br>                     prints.<br>                     photostats<br>                     copies<br>                     scans<br>                     faxes<br>                             and is very easy to use.i bought mine of a printer website and saved about half the price doing so.<br>   i.ve had other epsons and had no problems at all.they come with a disc with easy to understand installation instructions and all you need to no on how to use.and no im not an epson printer salesman,but i am a fan of them.<br>  hope this is of help|`|hGZyXIFcaa	Lexmark are good and some are cheap!|`|STmsOTO5aa	I just bought an Epson sx 200<br>  its ￡50 from most shops<br>  i got it from Comet<br>  Its a printer, scanner, copier all-in-one and the cartridges come in separate colors so its cheaper to change ink.<br>  and if you check out ebay and type in Epson print cartridges you can by them very cheaply<br>  i buy my individual cartridges (magenta, cyan, yellow, black) for ￡1 a cartridge whereas if you bought them from a shop it would cost you near ￡40 for a complete color set.

75nbESJUaa	at the top it extends Critter. Critter has some methods() that BlusterCritter inherits, so they are not showing on this part of the code (but they are available for use). It looks like the code scans the gameboard (Grid) from BlusterCritters current location looking 2 rows upwards and 2 columns to the left. It saves [row,col] into a Location object. Then, it validates those possible positions. We don't have the validate code, I bet it is in Critter. Probably, the position cannot be currently occupied, not can the position be off the Grid. If NOT occuped or NOT off the grid, the position is added to the collection ArrayList bours.<br>  <br>  The GameProgram (not shown) would then evoke act(). act() is the 'event' -- the entry point --  that triggers getNeighbors scanning location on the Grid, checking to see if 4 or more neighbors were within 2 rows above and 2 columns to the left. If so, BlusterCritter's assigned color get darker. But if on the other hand, the neighbors are futher out than 2 x 2, the color of BlusterCritter will be changed to lighter.<br>  <br>  No, there is no easier way to explain this.

First of all, I know his password and second of all Myspace has this feature that does not allow just anyone to search and find minors.  A minor's page can only be viewed by people they add as friends.  I like that feature.  I think that any site like that CAN be dangerous if you are not acting responsibly on it.  It can also be a lot of fun for a kid.  I am comfortable with my kids having them.  Of course they cannot use their real full names and their pictures have to be age appropriate.

KfxTNNP5aa	That is about like asking what is the most important thing on a computer.<br>  <br>  It all works together so the idea is to find a good balance. <br>  <br>  Ram <br>  Stream Processors<br>  Memory Clock<br>  Core Clock <br>  <br>  These are your main component of a vid card. What you will run into though is some cards that have 1 gig of ram but sell for cheap. They are cheap because the Stream processors, Core Clock etc are slow.<br>  <br>  It would be better to buy a lower ram model but make sure the Stream processors, Memory and Core clocks are faster.<br>  <br>  Think of it like this.<br>  the Ram is how much data the card can handle but the clocks and stream processors are how fast the card can process the information. So if your processors and clocks are slow it doesn't matter what your Ram is because the processors cant keep up anyway.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to allow yourself a $ amount and then start searching for the best card you can get for that amount.<br>  <br>  Email me an idea of how much you want to spend I will see what i can find. What game are you wanting to play?<br>  <br>  As far as a Power Supply. If you buy a certain level card then chances are you will need to upgrade your power supply.

IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|ShMZl6CJaa	Your cpu is getting overheated. <br>  <br>  You need to get original genuine cpu fan and heat sink.

24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	Google's toolbar itself is a spyware! With the advanced features enabled, Google's free toolbar reads every page you surf, and yes, it reads your cookie too. Their privacy policy confesses this, but that's only because Alexa lost a class-action lawsuit when their toolbar did the same thing, and their privacy policies fail to explain this. Worse yet, Google toolbar updates to new versions quietly without asking. This means that if you've toolbar installed, Google essentially has complete access to your hard disk every time you connect to Google (which is many times a day). Most software vendors, and even Microsoft ask if you'd like an updated version. But not Google. Any software that updated automatically presents a massive security risk.

Some power management controllers will discharge the battery (whilst you are plugged in to mains) to a specified level eg 95% to keep the battery in use and also nearly at full charge for if you unplug from mains.<br>  <br>  The manual way of achieving this is to unplug from mains, when it tells you that the battery is low, plug it back in.

Norton has rewritten the code for their 2009 products and made them use much less resources.|`|DISmd2wVaa	Regrettably you have 2 words in your question that don't go together: "best" and "Norton".<br>  <br>  Norton is one of the worst security solutions available.  It is a resource hog, slows the computer down by half, takes over everything (the Norton name occurs like EVERYWHERE), the updater is erratic (or maybe their server is slow), and it is not intuitive to use.<br>  <br>  Additionally it starts performing scans when you don't want them, and try to find out how to turn OFF, or PAUSE, a scan that has started...good luck!  Also even finding how to configure a scan and the scan times requires a Norton Master Programmer/Systems Analyst with PhD's up the ying-yang. <br>  <br>  Norton is a PIECE.  The same comments apply equally to McAfee which is second in line (but competing strongly for the coveted resource-hog, intrusive award) to Norton.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend some other solution, such as Zone Alarm or Panda.|`|HawhBNLXaa	Norton products are kinda heavy and expensive ..<br>  <br>  if you want a cheap and lite software instead i would recommend Avira AntiVir ..<br>  <br>  it's lighter than norton and better ... there is also a free ( Classic ) version ..<br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|FbX74i8Uaa	I believe it is worse originally (not sure about 2.0) Norton 360 was a turn around and one of the reasons for it being different was that it was light on system resources compared to previous nortons.

It's absolutely crazy that there should be a<br>  10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. Thus<br>  it should come as no surprise to you when I say that the<br>  only good thing about most updates are their potential to<br>  create all kinds of computer/software conflicts.<br>  <br>  I have never strayed away from 9.47, and many "flashers" <br>  swear by 9.45. Think of those two Flashes like Windows <br>  XP compared to Vista. Please take a look at the Asker's<br>  feedback comments to this other "Best Answer" of mine, <br>  (even though his YouTube issue isn't the same as yours):<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  If that looks interesting to you, here's the appropriate link:<br>  www . old apps . com / flash _ player . php ? old _ flash _ player = 14<br>  <a href="http://www.oldapps.com/flash_player.php?old_flash_player=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldapps.com/flash_player.php?...</a><br>  <br>  Another thing you might want to consider is whether you <br>  have some crappy utility such as GWA, SpeedBit, Jaton,<br>  Trident, Diamond Fire, ATI or Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" live streaming video files. <br>  Even YouTube, Google and Macromedia understand this<br>  and write that in their own FAQ's. Thus, if your computer <br>  has any type of "accelerator", please dump it, burn it, rip <br>  it, kick it, trash it, uninstall it -- do all that you can to get <br>  as far away from it as possible.<br>  <br>  Because you're not the first person this week to ask this <br>  question, I recently did lots of Googling, researching and<br>  reading about "flickering/shaking" videos -- and nearly all<br>  the discussion threads I came across mentioned "nVidia" <br>  drivers. Do you maybe have one installed on your comp?
hXHBm1BSaa	Uninstall all the software for it. Go to device manager and right click the driver listed and select uninstall. Disconnect it first. Then immediately re-boot. After you start, download and run ccleaner.exe to clean the registry. ALWAYS let it do a registry backup before repairing. You may need to run it more than once, as some entries can appear needed until others are removed. 3 times normally. Restart again and then run the original installer. If it asks, connect the printer. Otherwise you may need to plug it in and let it self install.|`|sFUyqjquaa	go to control panel,printer and faxes and on the top left you will see add hardware,see if your printer is there and so on.
KFagjt8Jaa	sounds like they are talking a load of bull may be they was talking about going on there max package which gives you unlimited downloads.<br>  are you on connect 2mb the bt service with sky or the LLU network Local Loop Unbundling can increase the speed but it all depends on your line length and condition|`|2LbTrlQnaa	If Sky say you cannot get 8mb it is because of your location.  It is not necessary to have a Sky phone line to get Sky broadband (I have a BT landline).  There may be something on the http;//sky.com which allows you to key in your postcode and your ability to access high speed broadband is assessed|`|tfuPCVzOaa	I have the up to 8mb service from Sky and get a realistic download speed of around 450kbps on most sites. I've had Sky for about two years and have no desire to change. Why would I when I only pay ￡5 per month for Broadband?|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Possibly but not likely, The speed your line will support depends primarily on length and quality of the line this is not going to change by changing phone line providers as your signal is still going to be coming down the same physical line. What will change if you take a Sky phoneline is that they will switch you to an LLU (local loop unbundling) service basically your line will be run through Sky equipment at the exchange rather than through BTs, in some cases when this is done the LLU provider can squeeze the line for a little more performance than BT achieve depending on the technology in use. If your line through BT will only support 4.5Mbps then you may see an extra 0.5 to 1Mbps improvement via Sky but you may also see no improvement.|`|R5LJiO6raa	smells like bull to me <br>  look here for tips on how to get the most out of your broadband connection<br>  <a href="http://www.dslzoneuk.net/socket.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dslzoneuk.net/socket.php</a>|`|levE5VCpaa	Get virgin cable
g8JGLnk6aa	They both work fine for me and I'm in Copenhagen, Denmark. There could be several reasons why they don't work:<br>  <br>  1. Your IP has blocked them somehow. <br>  <br>  2. Something's up with your computer. <br>  <br>  I think #1 is most likely, since you are able to load other sites just fine without any problem and also since they both have a .in domain.

Take the time to do so, and read things carefully.<br>  <br>  I have a facebook page, to keep track of some people who otherwise do not have a social network site (I prefer LinkedIn myself).<br>  <br>  So, before you go and setup a page, read through the setup process, and what you need to enter, and what is a choice.<br>  <br>  btw - it is never a good idea to use fake names. What if you lose your password, and need give info to get a new one? <br>  <br>  What you might want to consider is creating a second email account, at Yahoo, Gmail or Hotmail, and use that exclusively for Facebook.|`|H4Xo9qkQaa	Facebook is probably the safest social network out there, There are so many security and privacy settings.

1qaQ7c7Uaa	The type is easy enough.<br>  ??check :: [Char] -> Bool<br>  <br>  To think about these things, start at the end and work backward. The end of the list means it has nothing in it, so in that case all the remaining characters are great.<br>  ??check [] = True<br>  <br>  That's easy enough. For everything else, the trick is to successfully combine two things: what you know about this element (written in Haskell as x) and what you know about all the elements after it (written in Haskell as xs).<br>  ??check (x:xs) = resultHere && resultAfterward<br>  ????where<br>  ??????resultHere = isDigit x<br>  ??????resultAfterward = check xs<br>  <br>  Or, to condense it :<br>  ??check :: [Char] -> Bool<br>  ??check [] = True<br>  ??check (x:xs) = isDigit x && check xs<br>  <br>  There's a function called all to check if something is true for all elements of a list, used like this :<br>  ??check :: [Char] -> Bool<br>  ??check xs = all isDigit xs

They do ok for strategy and rpg games but if you are into multi-player LAN games like Halo and Gears of War they simply require additional cooling to keep up with the activity.

If you do choose a laptop a power vented lap table will greatly reduce heat issues. <br>  <br>  As to the specs on the machine they are not that impressive - I think you can do better for the money.

If the pin didnt fall off, and you bend it back into position it should fit into the socket.<br>  <br>  Best way to make sure it's realigned is to look at the processor from the edge, and bend the pin so it hides behind the row of straight pins, then turn the processor once to look at it from another angle and adjust it so it is aligned with those rows of pins. When it's identical to both rows of pins (viwed from two ajointed sides) then it should fit into the socket with little effort.<br>  <br>  If the CPU is damaged beyond repair, then you need a Pentium 4 or a Intel Celeron (with Northwood core and Prescott core) that fits into a socket 478, and supports a Front Side Bus speed of 533/400 MHz.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|d7f5424e9fed4ebd9495162760b47abbaa	The motherboard in that computer can accept a Socket 478 Pentium 4 Processor with a 400 or 533mhz front side bus.

I am guessing that you have not upgraded the processor or ram, so it would still have a single core processor with 1gb of ram or less. In which would be a bad idea for windows vista.

So the question you must really ask yourself in general is do I want to go PC or MAC.  I love the Mac, but unfortunately cost has always been a factor to me.  However with a good memory upgrade you can run Fusion or Parallels desktop and put windows on it and shazam, you have a windows computer too.<br>  <br>  In my opinion any application related to video and picture editing for the average person is FAR superior on the Mac. It's all in what you want to do.  Also, you worry about viruses next to never on a Mac, and the longevity of Macs seems to be much longer.|`|Mgy3uoFGaa	im my honest opinion i would say pc on the basis that they are cheaper and cost-wise can perform as good or even better.

This is very important<br>  <br>  This should reset the LSP stack, and renew AntiVir's LSP.<br>  <br>  Note that if you have any other software that uses the LSP stack (usualy security related), then this will need to be reinstalled also.<br>  <br>  This problem is usually caused by other software that uses the LSP stack, mostly from improper uninstallation.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking that this will also sort out the internet connection issue.|`|AA11048332	There are so many free antivirus programs that does that exact same thing.

2vL8wOHZaa	Yes it will make all of your Ram run at the lowest speed. So now your 1066Mhz Ram is running at 667Mhz. Remove the 667Mhz Ram and your stability issues will go away. I hope this helped.|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	Yes, you should run the same Value RAM, not mix Values... Your system will try to down clock the faster RAM to match the slower RAM, this will cause system lag or full on crashes...|`|I4TLCFf7aa	Running ram of different speeds causes the system to slow down to the speed of the slowest ram that is installed.  Since the 667 "can't" speed up, the 1066 must slow down to 667.  This is going to cause the 1066 to heat up quite allot, and possibly become "unstable".

hXHBm1BSaa	First you can not learn by being told. It is impossible to cover every possible problem you might encounter. The only way to learn is to read everything you can, and practice. Removing spyware, virus or any other malware requires a program with a database of infection patterns. There is Malwarebytes from <a href="http://malwarebytes.org," rel="nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org,</a> this will remove anything. More important is being able to provide protection to keep them out in the first place. There are many programs for this, study up on people's comments about them. I prefer AVG. You will need to learn how OS installers work, and the problems possible with an OS. Particularly learn about partitioning, and when to use it, how to do it safely, and why it is not always very useful on a Windows machine. If you want to make a guess at this and email me through Answers, I will talk to you some more. The big thing is to be willing to work at learning. It can take a long time, I have been in the business since before PCs and Windows were ever thought of (bordering on before DOS), and still do not consider myself an expert.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Best way to learn - is start getting hands on expirience.<br>  <br>  Get older computers, take them apart, and see how they are built.<br>  <br>  Then, build your own.<br>  <br>  As to software - same principle. Install, screw up, repair.<br>  <br>  The virusthing - it`s different every day.<br>  Common sense, experience and sometimes dumb luck help you out.<br>  <br>  Find what software works best for you - for things are quite personal at times.<br>  <br>  What you also can do is see if you can find e-books online (mininova.org) on computer and software related subjects.<br>  <br>  The best experience is the hands-on kind.<br>  Been there, done that - am sysadmin and part of an IT support team that covers all of Europe now.|`|rdxRkxi5aa	firstly there is no such thing as an expert! i am involved with university level study and i have been called a technocrat, an nerd, and a geek! there are two realms of knowledge, either maintenance such as BSeng and A++ and so on, these teach the basics and advanced stages of computer hardware and engineering.<br>  <br>  the proficiency side of things such as programming and so has its own unique calling, and quals with all of that.<br>  <br>  and finally there is the user orientated side of things such as RSA or Clait or ECDL and BSc and HNC quals.<br>  <br>  the first thing i would say is that computers are here to stay, and what ever people call you, there are a fantastic thing to learn and know the systems and the workings of.<br>  <br>  have a bash at what university courses are available if you really want to have something to shout about.<br>  <br>  if not or you decide that the university route is not for you then there are college and local further education places but i would have a bash at the big stuff!!!|`|04CjQ7njaa	you need a hands on approach.<br>  <br>  there is loads of wed sites which will show how to do??<br>   <br>  but, being shown, as on course makes things easy.<br>  <br>  if you do something wrong they'll explain how and why .<br>  <br>  with Computers there is no quick fix.and how to fix it<br>  <br>  look in to going on starter courses at your local college.<br>  <br>  mostly the software is what you pick along the way.<br>  <br>  there is one other way get job which deals in computers|`|zWZe6wA0aa	You can't learn that kind of thing off the internet, people won't want to use your business unless your qualified to handle their computers.|`|MEKgaOSDaa	you said you dont wanna go on a course but this would be your best bet, you can only get so far on your own my friend, look at local colleges or some booklets and see what courses are available|`|xZFEc8Nsaa	You have to buy like Norton Antivirus or any kind of anti virus software and download it on any computer to remove viruses.

If you can, try to buy a cheap computer and try reparing that before trying on a customers computer. Hope i helped you!!!|`|1pc8nwFPaa	yo, dude... i'm a kid and i never went for any computer courses, just click around playing on ur pc(i did for around 7-14yearold) and ull get good and better thats how ii learnt, but u cant get rid of viruses on ur self u need a anti-virus program, and ppl wont teach u 4 free cos they want money|`|I0mIEZi0aa	forget it, you need a virus data base|`|idrc0deQaa	It's probably a difficult thing to learn quickly, although a few companies are teaching that kind of thing.<br>  What I would do is:<br>  1) read a few books about general computer architecture; you will never get far if you can't tell your CPU from your Gb from your IDE from your USB. Your local library probably has that kind of book.<br>  2) Then build yourself a computer. Almost nothing will teach you more than to have to buy all the spare parts and assemble & connect them yourself; you could probably do this very cheaply by collecting spare parts froms friends & family or buying them at your local boot sale.<br>  3) Install Linux; even if it is a Windows world out there, Lunix will teach you much more about how computers actually work, and that knowledge will be handy even for a Windows PC.<br>  4) Teach yourself a programming language; you can do without, but learning Perl or C or anything similar will make you feel more at ease with your computer.<br>  5) Experiment, read, exchange on forums.<br>  6) You can also connect your computer without any firewall or anti-virus onto the Internet; it will then most probably become infected soon enough. Then see if you can repair it. You can also buy old hard disks at car boot sales and see if you can read the data stored on them, or even boot from those disks. (beware though to do that on a PC on which you do NOT store personal/confidential/important data as you're likely to loose it all while playing...)<br>  Good luck!
FD8I4zthaa	Is your cpu fan running? Maybe you didn't use the bonding paste properly.<br>  <br>  Sounds like overheating.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Sounds like either it is overheating or the power supply is inadequate.  Verify that the power supply is large enough, and make sure all fans are turning; use a utility program to check temps or check them in the BIOS. If you installed the CPU yourself, make sure you have a proper heatsink and operating fan on it.|`|RBcobj0raa	This is quite difficult to answer. I have some questions to ask before I can really help you. <br>  <br>  1.  Did you buy the CPU, heatsink and fan together? Or did you buy seperately?<br>  <br>  2.  Did the heatsink and fan have paste on already to fit on the CPU? If not this is really dangerous. As you need to have paste on the CPU?<br>  <br>  3.  If you had paste on the heatsink and fan did you keep installing and uninstalling the heatsink and fan.<br>  <br>  4.  Did you press firmly down on the heatsink and fan to hear a clicking noise?  <br>  <br>  These are very important questions.  Any of these have serious results as the paste may be uneffective if you kept installing and uninstalling.  The type of paste you used as well is important some pastes are better than others.  <br>  Arctic paste is best.  More expensive than most pastes but well worth it.  <br>  Another thing to do as well is to check whether the graphics card is properly inserted and all other componements.  What you can also do is to check whether it's overheating turn on the PC and if you can go into the bios look under CPU temperature.  If it's anything above 50 degree then it's overheating.  Follow the above to check what the problem is.|`|L1KN7i0aaa	^<br>  I<br>  Yep check cooling fans are running etc sounds like an overheat..

AA11442722	Open office imports and exports Word documents quite well. Though you might consider switching to Open office period. It's free, you can install it on just about any OS and it is fast becoming the standard in the business world even though the Word Document format is still the standard. Ironically many times today people are saving Open Office docs in word format and sending them to people who open them in Open office :) <br>  <br>  As for the Asus eee, the distro it comes with is rather flaky. I'd suggest getting some help from an experienced Linux user and putting Fedora or Ubuntu on that machine. You'll have a much more robust machine but at a very low cost.

On this chart a Core 2 E6600 @ 2.4GHz 1396 points, while a 4800+ scores 1048.<br>  <br>  The Athlons are fairly old chips and it does not mean AMD makes crappy chips. Back in the day they kicked the daylights out of Intel's Pentium 4. AMD's new Phenom II chips are awesome and can easily match a Core 2.<br>  <br>  A 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo will be a good upgrade, though it'll also force you to change out the motherboard in your work computer, which might in turn require an OS reinstall.|`|YESUhp8gaa	When you compare AMD to intel for the core frequences and number of cores, you will notice intel runs faster because of their better l2 cache.<br>  Now if you compare AMD to intel in terms of price, AMD will run faster.<br>  <br>  AMDs are good, but mainly for there energy efficiency and better price per performance.<br>  <br>  Besides, you can't not put an Intel processor on an AMD socket, you would have to replace the entire motherboard to do that.|`|d7f5424e9fed4ebd9495162760b47abbaa	AMD does not make "crappy" chips.  AMD fight back and forth and sometimes one or the other are ahead in one way or another.  Right now the Intel Quad Cores are hot and clearly leading.  However the 2 processors you're describing and for their purpose shouldn't be seeing an overall huge performance difference.  There could be a myriad of things causing your performance issues.  But to me last would be the processor.  <br>  <br>  You ram configuration, slower hard drive, bloat ware, data management.  However if you have the money to spend I don't think a 2.8ghz, Core 2 Duo would hurt!  :)

It runs XP as an OS.  It came with 1 gig of memory and 120 gigs of hard drive.  It is a bit on the slow side, but that's to be expected.  Other then that, I have no complaints.  It will connect to the web via Ethernet or WIFI.  They surf the web just fine.  The screen, although small, is very bright and sharp.  The keyboard size is only 92% of a standard keyboard, but that can be over come with a little practice or you can connect a standard keyboard via USB.  I also like to use a wireless/USB mouse instead of the touch pad, but that's just a personal preference.  <br>  <br>  All in all, I'm quite happy with the little thing.  <br>  <br>  If you go to a place like Office Depot, Staples, or even Wal-Mart, you can actually put your hands on one and see if it will work for what you want.
sftn1Sy8aa	Vista does not comes with any anti virus. Laptop manufacturers might some time bundle some antivirus with laptop, but that is valid for a very limited time.<br>  <br>  There are many good FREE Antivirus out there, that you can install on Vista.

Uninstall the 90 day Norton trial and get AVG free or similar as an anti-virus, Spybot Search and Destroy for spyware cleanup and maybe Comodo free firewall especially if you don't have a router.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) You have to understand games (game theory) to make a good game.<br>  <br>  2) You have to understand a little bit about human psychology to make a good game.  (Monopoly is pretty simple as far as game theory - make money - but it keeps people engaged for hours, and even days.)<br>  <br>  3) You have to have a pretty good grasp of both computer programming and graphic design (not something that you find in our species more than once every few centuries - da Vinci was the last great analytical artist) to create a good computer game.<br>  <br>  4) If you just want to fool around, there are rpg generators available for free.  How good any one is, and how good a game you can create without having the knowledge needed is another matter.  World of Warcraft wasn't built by one person who had to ask how to do it.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) Lose Frontpage.  All the crap it generates causes problems on real servers, and confuses ral browsers.  Microsoft's idea of HTML and real HTML are very different.<br>  <br>  If you MUST have a WYSIWYG editor (real web developers use a web server to see what the site looks like) use Kompozer or Aptana Studio.<br>  <br>  2) The photo has to be the size it's going to be on the site.  Changing its size in the <img tag reduces the quality.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't do anything to the photos - scan them in the size you want them to appear on the website.  Use them.  If you want to edit them, just edit them (but every step you take with them reduces the quality somewhat).

If you have any laptop or any other wireless device that connects through the same router in your house, they're always going to keep connecting over and over sometimes even when they're off. If you are really for sure that someone was actually able to guess the password and hack in, then you should just unplug the router but that's nearly impossible. Someone might try to guess the password and the light on the router will come on for like a few seconds or something but they won't be let on the network. Even if someone else was using your internet, it wouldn't really slow down the internet enough for you to notice it. I have 6 computers on one router and I don't notice anything.

Internet Explorer 8 is new and glitchy.|`|uGUvct02aa	There should be three icons at the top right corner of the screen.  One is a minus sign.  One looks like a square with a bar across the top and the other is an X.  The middle one...the one with the square with a bar across is a window adjustment button.  Left click it one time.  It should change into something that looks like two squares.  Then go to an edge, wait for the cursor to turn into a two sided arrow and then hold down the left button of your mouse while dragging. That will resize your window.

The CD is simply a program that you install which allows you to configure the router. <br>  <br>  A router, once setup/configured is a stand alone device and doesn't even need a computer attached to operate! Routers all have internal computers to keep connections alive.<br>  <br>  All that being said, you don't need the CD at all for any reason!  The CD is to make it simpler for those who don't understand how a router works and don't want to find out! <br>  <br>  To "uninstall" a router, you unplug it! That is all there is to the issue you don't need to "remove" anything from the computer.<br>  <br>  Then connect the new router (use an ethernet cable don't try it wirelessly) - restart the computer and run the setup cd (if you have to), or just open a web browser go to <a href="http://192.168.1.1" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.1</a>  (for linksys) enter the username and password for the router - those are in the "setup guide" and configure the router!  NO CD has to be used!<br>  <br>  --Edit--<br>  Yes I know Linksys has a sticker that says, "RUN CD FIRST". Its only because they don't want the phone calls on how to setup a router without using the guides that are on the CD!  If you check the manuals, and the install guides, you will find you don't need the CD to setup a router on ANY computer.

Containing information and settings for all the hardware, software, users, and preferences of your computer, whenever you make a change to the Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes are reflected and stored in the registry. The Windows operating system<br>  <br>  continually references this information during its operation.<br>  <br>  When the Windows registry becomes very large, your computer’s can become very slow and it can cause it to be unstable. Some computer users will spend a lot of time and effort going through the registry and trying to fix the slow computer manually. Not only can this be a daunting and frustrating task, it is also a very risky one.<br>  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!<br>  <br>  Clean your Registry can make your computer faster<br>  Most computer users find this task confusing and time consuming and those who are not advanced computer experts run the risk of permanently damaging their system by trying to fix their windows registry manually. Using a registry clean and repair application is the fastest, easiest, and safest way to fix a slow computer. While there are a number of registry repair applications available, few offer a comprehensive set of features that enable you to completely clean your registry safely.

Added on toolbars are notorious in causing problems.<br>  <br>  Try this go to Start > All programs > Accessories > System Tools > Click "Internet Explorer (no add-ons).<br>  <br>  Now run IE for a good long while and see if the browser gets faster.<br>  If it does help, you must now determine the specific add-on the is causing the problem.<br>  <br>  Go to Tools > Manage Add-ons and disable, one by one, each of the "Add-ons currently loaded in Internet Explorer" until the problem dissapears. Then either leave it disabled or download and install a new copy of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BvBJfHxZaa	Because it sucks.<br>  Get Mozilla Firefox<br>  It's much safer and quicker.<br>  Haha, I sound like a salesmen...any who, that's just some advice.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	IE is junk and your probably running Windows too, dump all that garbage and move to Linux and Mozilla.|`|9cc9d1b1db5e5452f3279720cee18e87aa	Check this out.<br>  <a href="http://techtalk.pcpitstop.com/2008/11/10/the-ultimate-pc-tune-up-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://techtalk.pcpitstop.com/2008/11/10...</a>|`|kmTnIuL2aa	Could be because its internet explorer.

You should update your internet explorer if you haven't yet. Internet explorer 7 goes a bit faster than internet explorer 6. If you have windows internet explorer 6 still (big butons like back and forward and home and refresh at the top under menu bar) and you have windows XP, just go into start, my computer, and at the top type in the website you want to go to and it'll switch to interent explorer without even opening a new window.
