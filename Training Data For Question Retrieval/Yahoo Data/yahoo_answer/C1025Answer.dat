oPbLcfKoaa	Duplicolor is BY FAR the better paint for a bicycle if you intend to refinish properly. Use their sandable grey primer, color coats, and clear coats... all LACQUER, not enamel. Rustoleum is fine for outdoor furniture but not for bikes.<br>  <br>  Bikeworks has answered this a thousand times I bet, so I tried his techniques which will be posted in my archives soon, once I get all of the text done. If you want detail right now just click on "Discover" and look for "paint my bike".|`|JyR2ENkVaa	Rustoleum is a great paint; I have used it in the past and had good results. Their primer is the best to use also. Just make sure you do prime the frame first because the paint will be much more resilient then without a primer. And best of all it won’t cost you much for paint off the shelf.<br>  Don’t forget to prep your frame really good because any scratches, dust, chips or dirt WILL show through your new paint job.<br>  Have fun.

A4tps9Klaa	I agree that the 13 title runs are absurd. I've been watching him ever since he came to WWF in 1995 as he slowly developed into a star with major talent in the late 90's. I never considered him a megasuperstar (like the Rock or Stone Cold), but i don't think he was that far behind them in his abilities. He's been consistently productive and good for about 10 years now as one of the main eventers. I personally don't like seeing him get the belt back what seems like every few months, however.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	What show are you watching? Triple H, terrible on the mic? I have NEVER heard anyone say that about HHH before and I've been watching for a long time. He's one of the best in the business and if you can't see that, then you know nothing about the show.<br>  <br>  Just wondering? Why aren't you getting on Jericho for bragging about being Superstar of the Year. He doesn't go a single show without mentioning that.|`|vWrJMXGBaa	You are right his matches are very predictable BUT he keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. He does brag, beat up younger wrestlers and threaten people with his sledgehammer BUT that is what he is supposed to do...it is his persona...but hey you don't have to like it but maybe someone else does...but i do agree with you to a certin extent.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	You're a total hater. You shouldn't even be taken seriously, because your hate is preventing you from telling the truth.<br>  <br>  He's a damn good wrestler, has great matches, I love his character, and he is good on the mic.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	There's no point in arguing this.<br>  <br>  I personally think that about HHH, but most of what you said can be applied to Orton, too. You're not going to change any minds with your argument, and I know that because I used to question people about "what's so great about Mr. Kennedy".|`|kST3xlDnaa	EVERYTHING!

And he has a lot of composure..|`|e0W6d9TPaa	You said:<br>  <br>  "He is boring, he is terrible on the mic, his matches are so predictable, he's an undeserving 13 time world champion..."<br>  <br>  Let's stop there for a second. The words, "boring," "terrible" & "undeserving" are words used in expressing an opinion. Therefore, I'm taking what you're saying as your opinion. Did you watch Raw Monday? Did you hear the people cheer when HHH's music is played? That tells me that he has enough charisma to discredit the first 3 words of your rant. I'm going to stop now because nothing I say is going to change your mind. I'm cool with that. You don't like HHH, I think Randy Orton is only where he is because his dad & grandpa are wrestling legends and if Orton were a first generation star, he'd be jobbing to Tommy Dreamer on ECW.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|DyD9YJ2Xaa	let me guess the young guys rock and the vetrans should step aside hello who got orton started? and batista? oh that would be the game, he does deserve his tittles and its not because he vinces step son it because hes a great worker, and he puts people over, look how many times he did with jeff, hes good on the mike, hes funny as a face and badass  as a heel, when he is aloud to hurt people it looks good and the man has passion for the bussiness, look at rated rko vs dx wen he blew his knee out and finished the match, he has hbks blessing and ric flair wnts him to be the guy, he is good watch him and once u watch any wrestling for a long time its always predictable btw the words are written 4 u he just needs to make the best out of it|`|XLHa9hiiaa	He isnt being used properly even though he is a better face than cena he works best as heal. Look at triple h during the evolution era he was great its just once they turned him into superman like cena he started becoming bad.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	I'm with you man, the guy is boring to watch.

People may hate Triple H for Politicking, but There is no denying He is One of the best on the Mic.<br>  <br>  But Anyways why are you Complaining ? People have there Own Opinions about him. Just because you hate him that makes your Opinion a "Fact" and everyone should follow it No!. We have Individualism in this Day and Age.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Because he has what a lot of the young WWE wrestlers don't.....the "it" factor called confidence.  If the wrestler believes the lies he says then the audience will believe it......its called working the crowd.   Jericho has it, HBK has it, JBL has it, all of the legends had it.....well not Snuka brotha but he is still awesome.|`|0tJl0L5Raa	you're just young. you havent been a fan very long so you wouldnt understand the mechanics of what make a great wrestler. <br>  <br>  maybe you should still be breast fed by your mother.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	gees some one is jealous
sAHTMuAeaa	They are going to take three years off from trying to get back to the Super Bowl and then make a hard run after that.|`|d4sdqYxIaa	did anyone hear about the free agent pick ups? the defense should be one of the tops in the leauge. micheal boely had 107 tackels 2 years ago and last year he didnt fit in with the system in atl and now we have an athletic LB to cover RBs and TEs over the middle. rocky bernard is a good pass rusher and will help fred a barry stay fresh. and chris canty is going to be  real good as a DT. i dk much about cc brown but he brings more depth to the saftey postion. and everyone knows the saying defense wins championships. so yes|`|pnlvObEdaa	They should of went after Housh if they wanted to take a legitimate shot at teh superbowl, you never know how college receivers are gonig to pan out, Housh was a proven receiver.

I mean come on they are more then inviting Burress back instead of REPLACING HIM. Why do you want a trouble maker? Also if your team feel apart because you lost him then you have A LOT Of work to do. Steelers give him up to Free Agency and win 2 Super Bowls since, the Giants lose him for 7 games and fall apart. Something isn't right there.|`|UxooffHZaa	I wouldn't be surprised if they're back in the Super Bowl IF they get Burress back. He's That good.|`|6tGYe5roaa	Well I am sure that they are trying to take the steps to get back to the Super Bowl. Just as every team wants to try to take the right steps to get into the Super Bowl. However, I honestly think they have a lot of issues with WR. It doesn't seem like they are interested in signing a free agent for the position. They want to see what happens with Plaxico and his court case. If not, they said they will draft a WR and develop a player within their system. Without a real threat, they will struggle with their offense. We all saw what happened to them at the end of the season last year.|`|wxXguyK3aa	They need to get Burress back and if not, draft a good WR.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	No...just steps back...*L*|`|mTSOJKlyaa	no

DyD9YJ2Xaa	Right now sabin needs a gimmick of sorts (not an over the top tna one but he needs to be thrown into a long feud with a good story) personaly i do think that sabin is awesome in the ring and has great skills, if he was to be picked up by the big time his size would be a factor and the fact that he is a former tna star also limits his push, little guys tend to not be whc or wwe champ because vince likes bigger men to carry the strap, yes mysterio 1 but that was also bcuz eddie died and even though he worked hard and did deserve it theres no way he wins that if eddies still alive, he would be a great ic champ though but so far chris cant even win the tna tittle|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes|`|UWJinEbIaa	Let's look at it this way....if AJ Styles can't be TNA champion long term what make you think the younger version of him can succeed in the bias WWE universe?   Come on Frankie F'N Kazarian had a cup of coffee up North and he had the body type, the look, everything that was needed to make it up there and they told him go home.  I say be patient and wait until the ye olde folks retire so he can have a chance to be World Champion......|`|05RmoBJ6aa	Yes but upper midcard is as far as he will get. Provided he doesn't mess up it is Alex Shelley who will be a future World Champion; he is the complete wrestler: technical skills, power moves, aerial moves, ring psychology, cuts awesome promos, is over everywhere, etc. <br>  <br>  Sabin only looks and wrestles like a World Champion but in American wrestling those only get you so far.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	The look? Yes.<br>  <br>  The skill? Yes?<br>  <br>  The charisma? No. Chris Sabin is mainly lacking in this department or else he would've been able to span out farther than the X-Division in TNA. He is a good wrestler, but unlike his partner, he's not that great at playing a character or being charismatic.|`|agIiai2paa	No. He isn't tall or big enough to be a World Champion in WWE. <br>  WWE wants guys that is tall and buff like Triple H.<br>  If he went to the WWE he would be a jobber or a midcarder on ECW but most likely won't be taken seriously.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	yeah he probably could be a world champion one day - good skills and is a major star on TNA
s4VzPulYaa	Although I am not a slowpitch player, I'm a fastpitch player, hitting is my streangth.<br>  What it sounds like is you are 'all arms' and having good arm streangth is good, but you should be getting more into your hips. <br>  Try this on T drills. stand there like you are going to hit the ball, but rotate your hips forward, and keep your shoulders where they were before you swing. You should feel a torqe from your shoulder all the way through your abs and into your thigh. that tells you that you are getting your hips into it.<br>  Once you are finished with that for a while, try swinging, but make sure that your hips rotate before you swing the bat.<br>  Those are proper swinging techniques. <br>  Make sure you bat is "short to, and long through."|`|tX4RNX1faa	The most important batter in slow pitch isn't a power hitter as the ball doesn't carry the speed that allows the momentum of the ball meeting the bat and the change of magnified velocity. Changing the ball will force the teams to becomes batters looking for where they can idealy place their hits to move runners around the bases. That, and the extension of the bat out away from your "at bat" prepared stance and allowing the end of the bat to travel faster by having it (the bat) back as far as it will go back so when your first move on the ball begins with a forward move and not a crank up backward motion is mandatory for slow pitch. Your minds eye is on time but when your bat begins by going the wrong direction it throws timing off and flub hits are the result. Without copying your favorite baseball hitters or golfers the swing is just this: as you come forward with the bat your wrists bring the top (head) of the bat around a little faster that in timing and allowing your arms to extend simutaneously will get you bat speed turning your waist / hips to hit the ball out of the park isn't needed, where as ball placement is. You (your team)should be practicing batting with tennis balls to see them better and to be able to adjust your ability to spank the ball wherever the team needs you to hit it in order to score your team mates. We used to practice baseball by playing over-the-line with a golf ball, talk about small? When we got back to a real ball we could see the seams turning and hit like Rod Carew, spraying to all fields. Take a knife (very carefully) and poke two holes in the tennis balls for practice you won't have to go so far to chase them down. A batter on any frame can shift range and motion without stepping or changing their feet (giving away the direction you are aiming at) at all. As the waist pivots to turn the body the direction you want to hit is done as the ball is falling only after you recognize when the ball is in the air that you know where the ball is, and you can hit it to the defenses most vulnerable spot and take advantage of the empty zones on their defensive field. Isometrics will build your arm strength better than weight lifting in fact using your own body weight will give you muscle tone for all your needed purpose. Try a handstand against a wall and do pushups with your entire body above your head., do five an hour for a week then go to ten an hour every other day then try this. Push with your outside of your arm (while it is at your side) against a door frame. While standing sideways to it and act as if your arm is a bull dozer and the door frame is flat going to get moved. Push with all your arm, shoulder and mind strength and hold it, start with fifteen seconds five times a day then in five second incraments add until you are going a minute at trying to get the door frame to move. In nine weeks your chest and your arms will go huge. Slow pitch isn't won by big hitters it's won by teams who understand the concept of spraying to all fields, so teach them all this info and go win the league.
1ApbWVhsaa	If you think Gretzkys assist total will be topped you are crazy.he doesn't just have a few records.He has 61 records..To put it in perspective for you-If he didn't score ONE GOAL in his career he would still be Number 1 in points.He was +98 in 1984 he was +81 in 1981..<br>  <br>  The Oilers didn't have the best goalie in the world,they had Paul Coffey who was very offensive minded and still won 4 titles with Gretz as Captain..Orr had 2 and he played with many Hall of Famers as well.<br>  <br>  Orr was great but not the Greatest.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I have Orr as #1 BUT don't use his +/- as an argument.<br>  <br>   Tom Preissing (LA Kings DMan) was a +40 with Ottawa 2 years ago. Last year he went to LA and he became a - player. Did his game change that much.<br>  <br>   Sure, Orr's high +/- had a hell of alot to do with him BUT he had to also rely on his teammates..........Esposito, Hodge, Bucyk and Cashman. <br>   The Bruins had the top FOUR scorers that year. 7 in the top 10.<br>  <br>   The +/- might have been the WORST point you could make because it was a collective effort.<br>  <br>   Orr revolutionized the position like no other. He won Hart trophies, Conn Smythes and Norris trophies like they were going out of style.<br>  <br>   Who was the best is debatable but the +/- is not part of the debate.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	When you take ALL goals scored into the equation, <br>  Larry Robinson has the best goal differential in NHL history with a +159 (he was a +120 in 76-77)<br>  Gretzy has the second best with a +151 (He was a +98 in 84-85) <br>  Orr's +124 only becomes a +147 (1970-71)<br>  <br>  Another way of looking at it<br>  Orr played 31:18 a game to get his '+147'<br>  Gretzky played 24:34 a game to get his '+151'<br>  Robinson played 25:57 a game to get his '+159'<br>  <br>  So, if you are inferring that goal differential is just as important, then looking at true goal differential puts a dent into your argument.<br>  <br>  As for Gretzky, most GMs and scouts considered him to be a very good defensive players.  Had a positive takeaway ratio, and led the NHL in takeaways several times (4 to be exact).  He was also Edmonton and LA's choice of centre ice man in the defensive zone taking 84% of the faceoffs in the last 5 minutes of the game (the highest percentage in NHL history) and winning 63% of these (also the highest percentage in NHL history).  Gretzky finished in the top 10 for Selke voting 9x.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, the best defense....is a good offense!|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Sometime the best defence in a good offence.

tX4RNX1faa	you will need credentials, insurance, (no archery will reduce your insurance costs by a substantial amount as well) you will need artificial turf for the lawn type activities and games and shot put will not go well indoors no floor covering will be able to take that destruction. You will need equipment,  with back up for breakage, somehow getting a pin to stand weighted so it won't tip over when a horseshoe hits it and a place for the horseshoes to land where the floor won't disintegrate. I would hope your education includes the base understanding of all these sports as well as application and technique for competition level performance. I work with children and coach in the lab and in lecture. I see the need for what you want to do but indoor I don't see as very exciting for you or the athletes. You will have to stay away from darts, archery, fencing and javelin for the pure sake of inflated insurance costs. But, you can add lawn bowling, badminton, volleyball, discus and running races: 50 meter, 100 meter, 250 meter. There is also high jump and long jump. Which by adding you might receive funding from special olympics associations. Good luck in every way|`|ho9vN2L7aa	i'm no expert.... but you will probably need insurance in case of damages to the building (type of damage depends on your area) and just in case a child receives an injury. and i'm guessing you would need some sort of special education license... sorry i couldn't be more helpful!

mG2BCZe7aa	Remember this the Spurs have always been a play-off team... In 41 years of existence in the league they have made it 36 times. And in those 36 times they only managed to get into the finals 4 times, Meaning only in Tim Duncan's time.<br>  <br>  George have a great career finishing your career with an average of 26.2 points per game means how proficient your scoring is, an underrated defender nobody would know that he is second among guards in all-time blocked shots. David Robinson was also a great player one of only four players to record a quadruple double, one of only 5 players to have 70 points game, a career average of 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3.0 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game.<br>  <br>  What is detrimental to their careers though is the fact that they never led their teams to an NBA Finals much more win the ultimate thing. Or to add to David Robinson the accusation of Dennis Rodman that he was a soft player who was afraid to take over in big games, To be more precise: " The Spurs might be more of a basketball team if David Robinson didn't freeze up every time they play a big game...." I don't think I need to remind you waht the 1994 MVP Hakeem Olajuwon did to the 1995 MVP Robinson? To quote that announcer he said: "Robinson got bamboozled". <br>  <br>  Tim Duncan is the anchor of the Spurs attack, a very subtle leader with great fundamental understanding of the game. And is the main reason why the Spurs have always been considered perrenial championshiop threats. After Duncan have arrived the Spurs became legit contenders to the crown, there ain't no analyst who won't bring them up in the converstation of potential NBA finalist, that's his true value. Can I say that of David or George? 2 MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, 4 times NBA champion. Who else in Spurs history can top that?<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Scotty,<br>  <br>  i think you have to go with Tim Duncan on this followed very closely by David Robinson.  Tim has won 4 titles with this team and he was the missing piece for David to get over the hump (although David himself was also very successful).  <br>  <br>  Tim has really been the face of the franchise since coming in and has been a great model of consistency and will go down as one of the greatest power forwards (if not the greatest) to have ever played the game.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|XnhJZQvfaa	David Robinson. When the Spurs drafted Tim Duncan David was still in his prime and could have easily caused a situation in which one of them would have had to be traded and that could have turned out with Tim in a different uniform or David Robinson in a different uniform some of those vets that loved him leaving as free agents and that team needing to seriously rebuild. Remember David robinson was one of the most beloved figures in NBA history and one of the best players in NBA history. Scoring Champ, MVP, 72 points in one game, Before Duncan arrived he'd been; 8 times NBA All defensive team, 8 time All NBA 1st, 2nd or 3rd team, defensive player of the year, won a rebounding title, shot blocking title and scoring title, was over 3 blocks a game his first 7 years in the league in 93/94 the guy put up 30 ppg, 11 rebounds 5 assist and 3 block shots, and almost 2 steals a game. 91/92 the guy was at 4.5 blocks and 2.3 steals, 12 rebounds and 23 points. He did this in what was one of the best eras in the history of the league for centers and in the middle of the best era overall. Besides himself he had to compete with Shaq, Hakeem, Ewing, Smits, Edwards, Parish, Mourning, Moses Malone, Mutombo, Duckworth, Daugherty, Edwards... His sacrifice let Tim Duncan become Tim Duncan while letting management build a championship caliber team. Without him doing that they are in different draft positions, with different players and probably a different coach and those championships would not be.<br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|50PfC3OIaa	Each player carried the Spurs during their respective era's. But Tim is the one that has been the statesman and cog everyone works around. Without Duncan the Spurs would be a mediocre team. Tim's 4 rings and 2 MVP's speak volumes about his importance.<br>  <br>  Robinson is a close second because of his charities and stature as a NBA good guy.|`|V48H3aWQaa	I would have to go with Duncan, because of the title count and the fact that he is arguably the greatest PF to ever play the game.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	When you think of franchises, all that matters is rings!!!

Its shown that the SAS are a deep team, but as seen when TD was hurt with Manu, the spurs didnt win. TD has shown that he can hold his own against superman 1 and 2, yao and other big men.

4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I actually prefer the beatdowns of heel groups / stables to the main face, created heel heat and were becoming a superior force, especially if a weapon was used, like the Attitude Era and when Evolution, Team Angle were around, they were getting new blood over by creating heel heat for them and look where Randy Orton and Shelton Benjamin are, Orton is a main heel and Benjamin is the US Champ, although he needs to defend it more|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Same. It is boring to see Cena and HHH coming out on top every week.|`|UWJinEbIaa	It has to be balanced.....one side can't win every time.....if that happens than it become predictable and thus boring.   Oh and Superman overcoming the odds is the worst thing WWE can do....|`|2y2p3ww3aa	yeah i do....not only does it give better  ratings but it also keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats ...just waiting to find out what happens the following week....but i guess it'd be boring if heels are the ones who always steal the ending...that's why faces are also made to win<br>  <br>  but a heel victory to end the show is definitely my fav...|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	It can't always end with a heel winning because then there would be no reason the have faces. It's always going to be a back and forth. <br>  <br>  I loved how Triple H chased Legacy out of the building last week, and he's a face.|`|nawxNmKXaa	I Agree only because you want to see what will happen next show or week. With a victourious face there really is nothing.But there was one with HHH chasing orton that was good. Because neither orton or HHH really "won" anything|`|DyD9YJ2Xaa	u need balance in the ending sometimes u need to see cena clean house and star down his next oppenant other times u need him to get laid out from behind and leave the heel over his limp body, and other times its great to just see an awesome match to end the show between two faces for the tittle a good ole rasslin' match, balance is needed and u wont get ratings if every week if the heel or face is always on top and it makes for a sh*ty rivalry|`|wcgkX4lVaa	Sometimes there should be a variety of face wins over heel and heel wins over face, but yes I prefer the heels winning in the end. Only because it creates more heat for them and it builds a stronger, more interesting feud that makes people want to see what happens next.|`|XmqkzQqvaa	I hate it to but if heels win all the time it become really boring. Plus the kids will be upset and we love having those kids who cheer for every face and make Raw that much better (dripping with sarcasm)

t3rmVomeaa	Tiger has a good shot...obviously he kows the course and loves to play there...will his game be in "Masters" form, who knows.  I would like to see McIlroy play well there, and yes, he has been invited, but first timers at Augusta usually have a tought time figuring out the greens.<br>  <br>  With that said, Camilo Villegas is the one who I am looking to tame the course.  His game suits Augusta well, and the kid is due for a huge win.|`|sBrummATaa	TIGER WOODS|`|V95Gfiwmaa	contenders less likely to win: <br>  Anthony Kim<br>  Camillo Villegas<br>  Ogilvey<br>  <br>  Probably will win:<br>  Tiger (duh) lol|`|uua8nI85aa	I'm glad that Tiger's back in form, but I'd like to see someone else win.

ecff03abdcf3608faea8684f22766561aa	Hi Proc<br>  <br>  Matty Hoyle was 2008 British 125 champion (supporting races in BSB), and I believe he won the last round of the Red Bull Rookies at Valencia. <br>  <br>  I've seen him race a few times, and he looks quite promising. Obviously the competition in UK is probably not as strong as it is in the Spanish championship, where Scott & Bradley cut their teeth, but to win a Red Bull round is no mean feat.<br>  <br>  I just hope he's not  hampered by the Maxtra (or whatever they're gonna call it). Its a totally new machine, which is good news for the series, but It'll need some racing development time. His team mate Michael Ranseder  has got the experience, not sure about Matty. <br>  <br>  They've got 2 stroke guru Jan Witteveen involved with the project and a Harris chassis, so in theory should prove competitive eventually. Although there were rumours going round that Jan was quitting the project because he was unhappy with its progress and didn't want to tarnish his name. That was all denied.<br>  <br>  I'll be following young Mattys progress with interest.|`|LDVEzHsvaa	I cant say any more then Mr Gtti !

I don't think the gap should/would be that big, that's all. We'd still be in contention for the title.

5GI6hmFpaa	It basically means nothing.<br>  <br>  The use of ABEC ratings was an accident in inline skating.<br>  It is about bearings used in machinery that runs at extremely high speeds.  Nothing about rolling better under the weight load or speeds for inline skating.<br>  <br>  Some of the bearings used for the early inline skates were so poor that any ABEC rating guaranteed that the bearings were reasonable.<br>  Then the manufacturer's got their advertising people into the act by bragging about a number that isn't important or expensive.
xApAWlshaa	Here are some videos.(i like videos because u can watch it as its done)they should help a little.You can use an electric knife but my advice is for catfish you can peel the skin and fillet and put in a bowl of water with 2 teaspoons of salt.good luck enjoy your fish.:D|`|7royFhIgaa	Depending on the fish. You can fillet them using a fillet knife. Or you can take the guts out and take the scales off.|`|lECmz3SEaa	Stick the knife into the hole on the ventral side of the body. Then slowly cut towards the gills. Remove all internal organs besides the eggs. Then proceed to remove the gills. Rinse. Then place a knife diagonally over the body where the scales are and press down slightly and proceed to scrap the scales by moving the knife towards the fish heads position. Rinse again and that should do it|`|DBJyxAexaa	Take the fish out and put it in another tank. Then change the water of  the old tank and scrub down the tank. Then just put your fishy back in!<br>  <br>  off topic here: On another question you asked why jodi and beth hadn't been on j&k+8. Well IDK about Beth. But Jodi's sister does not have all the facts. In reality Jodi found out just before the third season that she could have been getting a salary for the past two years on J&k+8. So she asked for an outrageous amount and would not back down. So now she won't be put on t.v.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I've been watching wrestling since i was 8 years old and i enjoy WWE, TNA, ROH and the Japanese promotions Pro NOAH,NJPW and Dragon Gate.For me it's a sport and i watch it for the exciting wrestling action and the entertaining feuds, promos, segments and gimmicks !|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Entertainment.....and I have seen a number of horse races that were probably more pre-determined than anything on WWE.|`|GKJV2EBSaa	Although wrestling is scripted not fake,people get caught up in the moment.Just like with movies.some people cry at sad movies and some people are frightened by horror movies even though it is not real.Just enjoy it if you like it and if you don't like it don't watch it.|`|QY4Hy00qaa	I think sometimes people get so caught up in the storylines they cannot tell the difference between what's real and what's reality. I admit that I do get caught up in the storylines but at the end of the day I know that it is not real.|`|0TAld46gaa	Its like watching a soap opera.<br>  <br>  It has drama, passion and some pretty cool *** moves.<br>  Its just like why do you watch a tv show,<br>  It is meant for entertainment.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	it is sports entertainment|`|agIiai2paa	It's entertaining.<br>  <br>  People get emotional when they watch a movie or a TV show.

As for that, people get emotional about wrestling because it's like any other TV show you watch. These are real people playing characters that follow a storyline just like Lost or Grey's Anatomy. You become attached to the people in it and you keep up with all the conflicts. And I've seen people who are just as emotional while watching TV shows that aren't wrestling related. And those televised wrestling promotions are still considered to be a sport since these people put their bodies on the line by wrestling to entertain the viewers every single week.|`|GsNSRtAmaa	You're speaking of WWE, not all wrestling.  "Fake" goes to an extent.  Obviously when they draw blood, it is not.  The actors break bones and are physically abused, and you are drawn in by some mediocre story line written by a room of editors presented to a screaming audience with flashing lights and loud music.  Exciting.<br>  <br>  Wrestling in high school, college, and other settings where the sport is actually appreciated should be looked at as actual wrestling.  That's why the wrestling you watch is for 'entertainment' and isn't considered 'sport.'|`|A4tps9Klaa	I absolutely understand what you're saying. I've never considered pro wrestling a sport; i've always referred to it as entertainment, just a physical form of entertainment, which WWE themselves seem to promote it as these days. I've been watching wrestling for about 15 years now, starting when i was 10 years old. Back then, of course, I didnt think it was completely staged, but i had an idea that it was just from watching matches, seeing similar outcomes, etc. I think years ago it was pushed more as being more of a sport than it really was, as pro wrestling itself was something people didn't know much about, in terms of what goes on behind the scenes. Nowadays, it's all open knowledge for the most part. I've heard people refer to wrestling as a "soap opera for men", which i think is a pretty accurate comparison. To answer your question directly, i personally think it's because of the same reason we watch movies, sports, play video games, etc. We see things that amaze us legitimately, and those things leave a good impression on us, so we wan't to see more.|`|N4U2oKwEaa	How is it not a sport?<br>  Call it scripted, fake, whatever you want, but  injuries are real.  What else is real is the fact that those people are athletes .. serious athletes that train like crazy, just like any athlete that participates in "real" sports.<br>  <br>  And plus, it's extremely entertaining.<br>  If you don't like it, change the channel.|`|yBXaDqHKaa	i wrestled for real. i didn't do that fake crap. it is not entertaining at all. i don't see the point in at all. once you do the real sport, its not cool seeing that fake whatever you call it. you want to see real entertainment watch the graham st edwards match on flowrestling.org(or com) that's real entertainment.|`|10e2bf3811059572cd55b2111f1c4d4caa	The same reason you spend $ on movies. You know that movie is fiction, but you want to see it any way! It's entertainment and I do think wrestling deserves to be called a sport. Yes, it is entertainment, but it is also physical.|`|A9WCbC8aaa	It is called Sports Entertainment...and it is exactly that.  Why do so many people watch reruns of Seinfield and Friends or see a movie more than once even though they know how it is going to turn out.  Because they find it entertaining.|`|CtWSp4axaa	People get emotional over everything. Soap operas, walking in on your partner doing it with someone else, losing money after betting on the Cardinals at the Super Bowl...why should wrestling be any different?|`|6QNUjLmMaa	it is because..<br>  people who like wrestling,loves to see violence..<br>  i dont like watching wrestling...because i dont like violence..|`|2yVRuX0yaa	Its entertaining we get the thrill watching it i get all excited when Kane comes out so.|`|3gEBxNc4aa	its for entertainment, I bet you think that golf and bowling are sports

G0qBlKI1aa	who wouldn't want Jose Reyes as their teams lead off hitter?  Anyone that says they wouldn't is lying.|`|nDzenpkwaa	Well, don't pretend you wouldn't want A-Rod hitting clean up for your Mets.  What A-Rod said is being taken out of context, like everything he says to the media.  Damon and Jeter are both professionals and can handle someone saying they wish Reyes was batting lead off.  I bet Jeter and Damon wish the same, who wouldn't.  Then when October comes, Damon and Jeter can go back to doing what they do best and that is playing in the clutch.  Unlike Reyes!!!|`|5xIroQjMaa	There's nothing wrong with wanting your team to be better. The Yankees need speed badly. Between their weak defense and lack of speed, they're going to be hard-pressed this year. Players often wish out loud for better teammates. Just like Favre said a couple years back he wished Green Bay had signed Randy Moss.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Calm down and stop making a big deal of this he was just complimenting Jose for his skills, in fact after he said it he called his PR people to set the record straight that this wasn't ment to insult Jeter or Damon.He had to do this because ppl like yourself always dissect every thing he does and say's.Darryl Strawberry took out a full page add in todays paper also saying how terrible it is the way ppl are treating Arod he went on to say he has a problem with the union when <br>  1 player out of 104 players names come out and it's only Arod on testing that was done that was supposed to be confidentiality "Obviously somebody has it out for him.It's not fair if your going to name one NAME THEM ALL! They put him in a situation when it's just him alone against the world.Jesus Christ now the guy can't even compilment another player without ppl like you taking it out of context as an insult against his team.Another thing if your gonna come in here like a big man and post these comments learn to take it from everyone even fan's of your team, not every Met fan is going to agree with you.Jfar has been a member here for a while now show some respect for other ppl.If your gonna post be ready to take some criticism..|`|h6swK5PNaa	hey, reyes is a better lead off hitter than anyone on the yankees. He'd also be the fastest guy on the team. I'm a phillies fan, and i have to admit that reyes is pretty good. plus, if reyes was on the team, the yankees could move jeter off of shortstop, because jeter can't play that position anymore. he could go over to second base, or to the corner outfeild spots, where he wouldn't be a below average defender. I'd rather have reyes batting leadoff than damon or jeter. he just has so much speed.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I am going to give A-Rod the benefit of the doubt on this one. I don't think he meant it the way it is coming across. I don't think he was literally trying to say that he wants Jose Reyes to physically replace Johnny Damon or Derek Jeter in the leadoff spot. I think that he was just trying to complement Jose Reyes and express what a great player he thinks he is. However, A-Rod has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth. This is one of those times. I think it comes across a lot worse than it actually is.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	What he really meant was he thinks it would be great to have that kind of speed on the team.  Of course, he words his thoughts so clumsily that the original intent is always lost.    The Yankees should probably sew his mouth shut.|`|afee0e29771cb18093e76307e67462e8aa	It's no big deal what he said.  He was complementing Reyes.  Who wouldnt want somone with that speed and baserunning ability at the top of their lineup?<br>  <br>  I'm sick of everyone criticizing A-Rod for every little thing.|`|27mOtB7jaa	thats kinda interesting.  A-Roid is stupid tho|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	I'm sure a lot of the Mets said "I wish we had Mariano Rivera closing games for us the last couple of years"|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	All those steroids distorted A-Rod's perception of a winner. Last I checked, Johnny Damon has won multiple Championships. Jose Reyes disappears before September arrives.|`|jd14u32qaa	Get over yourself.  He was complimenting Reyes and it was IN NO WAY a shot at Jeter or Damon.  He was simply saying that Reyes would be alot of fun to watch every game doing what he does.

PrsbAjZAaa	3 for me<br>  <br>  <br>  Zola<br>  Di Matteo<br>  <br>  <br>  and i'd love to see John Terry as Chelsea manager one day|`|V4STBjyFaa	ive all ready got mine in Davie Moyes|`|x4QambMNaa	Juergen Kllinsmann|`|b2yD0TyEaa	jose mourinho|`|VOdl7xGpaa	eamon dunphy|`|buPeIIreaa	me at arsenal|`|YcCquky4aa	gary barlow......you said dream :P|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	Arsene Wenger. I don't care we're not winning anything, it's the dreamy way we play.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Neil Lennon would give his all for Celtic but i'm not sure if he is management material<br>  <br>  As for Arsenal i'm not sure, maybe Henry, Arsenal is "in his blood", so he says anyway|`|XU1KaWXwaa	rafa benetiz :) hopefully he will prove me right over the next few year.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Lol,I already have the best in the game at my club.I'd love to see Cantona or Giggs as manager someday.I think Cantona can do a good job,but he's relatively unexperienced,aside from the French beach football team.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	City had him, it was Sven Goran Eriksson, maybe not a great International manager, but his record at club level speaks volumes.|`|IgyinAMaaa	Jim Magilton|`|wQpdot1Raa	Gary Neville for Man Utd. It'll never happen but he'd just be so committed to the club.
beskolcCaa	that is great news..<br>  <br>  so chivs fans can stop talking chet!!|`|7Xridrxaaa	I think Hugo Chavez is going to mention his team's win in his weekly tv program and blame it on Fox and Calderon for being puppets of the United States haha|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Hahaha yea I saw the game but hopefully they will win in Jalisco|`|y2pLd9MXaa	I KNOW MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR KEPT ON TALKING **** ABOUT CHIVAS UNTIL I TOLD HIM THAT VENEZULA COULD NEVER BEAT MEXICO AND NO-ONE PENEZUELA CLUB COULD BEAT AMERICA THEN HE WENTED INSIDE HIS HOUSE<br>  <br>  Penezuela = Balcero<br>  <br>  I HOPE CHIVAS RAPES THAT ******* TEAM|`|Lu7GJnsXaa	baseball??<br>  I think chivas always loose when they wear tha ugly jersey..they should wear the beatiful red and white one. lol honestly why did they choose the color lime green and white for the away jersey?!?|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	Caracas is not a crappy team, its one of the big ones in Venenzuela....besides that I already posted a question about this. and gave my opinion...<br>  <br>  dumb substitutions+Dumb Substitutions= loss|`|qbPbvLuLaa	Bad game, bad substitutions, bad field.<br>  <br>  We will have our revenge in el Jalisco.|`|sNy23JzHaa	Come on you guys are going to tell me, you honestly believe Caracas FC is a second class team???<br>  <br>  They have not lost at home in international competition in a long time.<br>  <br>  No Argentina team has won there in 13 going on 14years.<br>  <br>  I don't think any Mexican have ever won there.<br>  <br>  They've played the Brazilians toe to toe.<br>  <br>  Not to mention they've been a dangerous team the last few Libertadores.<br>  <br>  You guys need to start showing some recognition to these teams, this is the same mentality El Tri has about the CONCACAF and look where we are, barely getting by. <br>  <br>  Chivas did not present a purpose why lie. They started Ochoa in a different position, in the middle of the game they gave up the midfield by putting in 4 forwards and no contenciones.  The subs did not work, and when your loosing Borgetti is not the player to send into the field, he's a player to start the game and then be replaced.  He slowed down the attacks a lot and spend more time arguing or in the floor rather and searching for a pass.  We have the next game against Caracas in el Jalisco next week, we're going to muder them and obtain our rematch there.<br>  <br>  Saludos............<br>  <br>  @ Rafa - ha ha ha, your right dude and he's probably going to announce that now that he has taken over the FMF the MLS is next.|`|DBQRLygoaa	caracas are the best team of venezuela.. but yes chivas lost unfortunately.. but in jalisco chivas will give another goleada. I hope this question isn't from an americanista cuz america has absolutely nothing to talk about. They don't even win at home.|`|jUeiFZfmaa	Yeah i was surprised that they lost to crap team but thats soccer it can go either way. But who do they face next en la liga mexicana?|`|qOOU1EVlaa	it wasnt chivas best game..but whos perfect?..every team goes thru bad games and GOOD games|`|Vctxf6uYaa	they are still the best team ever <br>  and will always be the best <br>  <br>  IT'S ALL ABOUT CHIVAS
KTxxd700aa	Yes, this year will be very tricky, 2 highly experienced yet still very competitive drivers will be necessary to give as much technical input as they can. The "Honda" was never designed for a Mercedes motor and the difference in balance and power delivery will take a while to get right.<br>  Bruno could make an F1 driver but he didn't win the Gp2 title last year, which I found staggering considering the so so opposition of the 2008 Gp2 grid, another year, grabbing the title convincingly would pave the way for a 2010 race seat.|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	I'm sure they will keep tabs on Bruno Senna, probably helping him to get a consistent drive somewhere this year, and sign him up for the Young Driver testing days he is still entitled to. <br>  <br>  Jenson is a given, but Rubens also deserves his seat for the way he battled through last year, and his unparalleled experience which will be even more vital now that the team is in new hands.<br>  <br>  Bernie may be a bit upset that he hasn't got his star-name in a car this year, and I feel that STR only signed Buemi as they felt Senna would get his 'Honda' drive and Gerhard Berger had signed the team back over to Mateschitz who prizes his young driver program. I can almost guarantee though that Senna will be Jenson's teammate in 2009... Rubens is going to have a DC-type final fling (hopefully with some better results!) knowing that it's his last chance. For all his great years in F1 it has to end eventually... Same with Patrese, DC... even Fisichella may be wary of this year being his last.|`|MK129BdDaa	yes i think they have. although rubens is old and way past his best, his experience will be important.<br>  Also I don't think you could put bruno senna in the car, he'd go to melbourne with just a few days testing nowhere near enough for him to get to grips with an f1 car.|`|O4CimCZuaa	I think they should've given Bruno Senna a chance to be in F1 and for Rubens to be an advisor to the team.|`|5VSAuCwiaa	Well, Barrichello seems to be about to sign the deal according to autosport.<br>  <br>  I'm very happy about that decision. I've always said that Bruno Senna is a disappointing driver. He has always had the doors open to the best teams in F3 and GP2 and he still managed to lose against F1 rejects like Giorgio Pantano.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think Barrichello is right when he says that he has unfinished business. He is still a good driver and a very good rain racer. If somebody can proof that drivers in their late 30's are still good for F1 that's Barrichello.|`|pLoCn8dWaa	I think that they have.<br>  <br>  If the car is as good as they have claimed it to be, then they need the two most experienced drivers.<br>  Barrichello proved that he can still perform in Britain 2008, and Button has just been held back by bad cars.<br>  <br>  But whatever the state of the cars, they need reliable drivers to bring home reliable points, as they will be searching for sponsors.|`|Kr6IAPNZaa	I think Senna should have gotten the seat, He is now going to the DTM series in a Mercedes-Benz team apparently!|`|FPJSoxYwaa	It's not the drivers I'm worried about, it's all the testing they missed out on during the offseason.|`|AA10349169	Bruno Senna would be a good guy to have|`|8Uy59oqIaa	i'm kinda glad that bruno isnt in this season i think he needed another season anyway if you asked me. 2010 will be for him. high expectations...
13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	lol....man, you guys come up with some funnyass sh*t.  i guess even inanimate objects dropped over dead after hearing about that ridiculous contract they gave asomugha.<br>  <br>  that's pretty sh*tty that you have to put a disclaimer on your questions...lol.|`|4cUwYzqgaa	Hmm interesting I think that's what goes on in Al Davis' head..|`|zFNOaDAYaa	You think Raider fans wish Al Davis was in front of it when it happened?|`|ZGQ8F23Gaa	how are we a train wreck we just won a championship|`|G5QqijG0aa	roflmao what they need to start becoming a winning team is get rid of the owner...  Awful hard to do but he just cant stay the heck out of things and let his personnel do there jobs....  he is the cause of all of there losing seasons...|`|FFJeaHX5aa	ur gonna get taged back for that lol, not by mean i thought it was funny lol but new season new lucky things to happen...|`|98bupiDFaa	That means alot coming from a Browns fan|`|7nDpz7vyaa	Yes, but I just can't quite put my finger on what it is.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, was Al Davis driving that train?
cUPzXfv3aa	Thank you Bevo, this question finally opened my eyes as to what has been hindering OU from winning the big game. We have just been putting to much stock in those texas players and not enough in these great and awesome oklahoma players, if we would quit depending on all these texas players to win and just stick to these good oklahoma players we could win a national championship again.LOL! <br>      I think Big Daddy Mack, has something to do with this he is  sending all these texas players down here and they are playing awesome until they play texas and then they are throwing the games to make texas look better than what they are! same way with the bowl games. <br>  Damn state of texas you either love them or you hate them.  P. S. I still think texas sucks! LOL!|`|agPn1LyCaa	i love oklahoma win or lose and they will always be my team (i'll just take the OU insults),  so OU fans dont take it the wrong way. but i think i have to agree with you, honestly UT doesn't owe it to OU. i think we need to realize that they're both good teams. Texas was probably bound to make a good teams. Therefore, i dont think that UT owes anything to OU and OU doesnt owe anything to Texas. In my opinion it's pretty much even.|`|kuh7CfcSaa	Aw...why steal a question concept?   Just to stand up for Texas?<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway....No team owes anything to another state.  Head coaches and players will always come from somewhere else.  Yeah, you will have a few that are actual local boys, but mostly they are from somewhere else.<br>  <br>  The whole nation should be paying homage to Texas and California as they seem to produce the most football talent.<br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt when you are the largest states...|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Perhaps we should just annex Texas and call it Baja Oklahoma. Then you would be happy. Not to mention our best are from Oklahoma:<br>  Bradford <br>  Gresham<br>  Lofton<br>  Smith<br>  Broyles<br>  Box<br>  etc.<br>  We just use Texas players to fill out the roster. Those Texas boys are always more than willing to upgrade to Oklahoma.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	they have no talent over there.|`|KNTofuxMaa	Actually, y'all both owe your legacy to Bear Bryant. If he would have stayed at A&M, neither one of your teams would have been successful against him. He was well on his way to taking Am to the top when he went home and built one of the greatest programs in college history. Say a special thanks to the Bear in your prayers, boys.|`|ENBhz7Asaa	Once again bevo, your hatred of all things crimson amazes me.  Give OU a break.  If it weren't for OU, you would never even have the "possibility" of getting beat during the season.  After all, you never play anybody in non-conference who's good, and aside from OU have no realistic threat of getting beat on a year in, year out basis in the Big XII.  We keep you guys grounded and keep you from being bored.  Also, I was an athletic trainer in texas high schools for 6 years back in the 90's and I can safely say that the talent level in texas is far superior to oklahoma high school talent.  When i lived down there, i saw a 3A texas school that could beat Jenks and Union here in Oklahoma.  Vernon, texas has a weight room the size of a gym and they're 3A and were awesome.  I give you crap a lot, but I love the rivalry.  I just wish they'd make the RRS a home and home game instead of the dump that is the cotton bowl.|`|yaZ6tnxxaa	As an OU fan. i think it's pretty even with OU and Texas. I mean, we recruit players from Texas and i understand where you're coming from. Even though Darrell Royal did go to UT from Oklahoma, i dont think they owe it to us because Texas still would've built up a good team no matter what, Darrell Royal just so happened to help them. I'm a die hard OU fan but there are also coaches that come from colleges and build up new ones to make them better.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	seeing how 90% of their team is texas boys. and the other 10% is from states other than oklahoma....yeah OU wouldnt have a team if it wasnt for texas.|`|8816e721e2ba35178f9a86d4e3b829f2aa	I know probably not enough players. I've always thought the same thing. That's why its called University of Texas at Norman. LOL!!! Sam Bradford and Jason White are both Oklahoma natives.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	If Jokinen and Keenan can get along this time around, it could work out well for the Flames.<br>  <br>  As for Cammalleri, I think they can re-sign him since the losses of Aucoin, Lombardi, and Bertuzzi clear up $8MM in space<br>  <br>  So, looking at $8MM + Cammalleri's current $3.35MM.........that gives the Flames $11.35MM to pay Cammalleri and Jokinen ($5.25MM) (Give or take a few dollars|`|x9GODf8eaa	I like the move, Jokinen has been talked about for years now, I think he will be a good fit with the Flames.<br>  <br>  As for Cammalleri, that depends on a couple things. LITY has the exact figures, but here's things from a Flames perspective. Aucoin, Bertuzzi and Moss (and a group of less significant players) will become unrestriced free agents after this year. If Aucoin wants to resign, as his career has been resurrected in Calgary, then I would think he would take a hometown discount, I would put him at 3 mill or less (down from his current 4). Meaning they could either sign Jokinen and Cammalleri, Jokinen and Aucoin/Bertuzzi/Moss.|`|xGxHkj8faa	I don't really like it because Jokinen was really fun to watch now he's not really on t.v. here in the United States.|`|N1OnviExaa	A Great trade. Jokinen's both a goal scorer and a set up guy. Lombardi has sucked the past two seasons and I don't really care that he's gone.|`|wmYnJd2jaa	As a Canuck fan I don't like this trade.<br>  <br>  He will help the Flames, he's an upgrade on Lombardi. Just not sure how he's going to fit into the depth chart and what his role will be - I expect Keenan will want to stress the defensive aspect of his game. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't know enough about the Flames cap situation to comment on Cammelleri.|`|lCi7QCbGaa	Honestly I don't really know how I feel about him coming to Calgary, I'm more pissed off that they traded Lombardi!!|`|vJNtyXbYaa	wonder if its enough to overtake San Jose or Detroit, good trade for the Flames they needed a #1 center|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I think they will still have 15M+ in cap room next season??<br>    <br>   He can't hurt them I guess. Never been a big Jokinen fan, apparently he is not a great dressing room guy and takes games off. <br>  <br>   HOWEVER, I think this will actually be his FIRST kick at the can in postseason (somehow) and Keenan has familiarity and Sutter is smart so we'll see. Calgary was a contender before IMO, they solidify that now.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Given that Jokinen has never been to a playoff game other than by buying a ticket...I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  Luckily he isn't being asked to be a dressing room leader; just play his game, be a team guy, and blend in.<br>  <br>  Give the Flames credit for at least trying to compete with Detroit and San Jose.

In the centre they were without Vidic (or once again Brown a natural replacement) and played with an injured Jonny Evans on pain injections. Wayne Rooney was also left on the bench for about 80 minutes and Tevez didn't even play. Inter could not score and for 65-70% of the game were outplayed. United should have a full strength squad for the replay in Manchester and have have won all but one game at home all season. Remember what they did to Chelsea at OT????   OUCH!! Glory Glory!!!|`|n13rCdZtaa	I wouldn't want to see a Man Utd V Liverpool match in the CL.

Bronco fan= No bias|`|JTSNljLhaa	Steelers are but hopefully my Pats will pass them|`|nTKNGajYaa	I'm a Niners fan, but over the entire history of the NFL, the Packers probably are the most successful franchise ever.  They have won the most NFL titles with about 12 I think it is.  They have countless Hall of Famers, and they are probably the most traditional team in the NFL.  <br>  <br>  If you are a serious Packers fan though, I seriously suggest finding out alot more about their history.  They actually had most of their success before the Super Bowl was invented.  If you wanna check out the stats, try the link below.  If you want to find out more, there are plenty of books you can read, I'd definitely look up stuff about Curly Lambeau.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pro-football-reference.com/te...</a>|`|uzIhl6wUaa	Of course they are. They totally creamed Dallas in the FIRST superbowl EVER! Bart Starr was probably or close to the best player on the Packers so far. Cheeseheads are the best ever they are GREAT!<br>  Lombardi was a awesome coach and always will be remembered. Oh yeah Ray Nitschke the best LB EVER!!<br>  <br>  FYI:12 championships and 3 superbowls to this day.|`|zJC18FtAaa	Dallas Cowboys 5 superbowls and a 578 win % the Steelers only have on more in 27 years <br>  <br>  Raider Fan|`|KNTofuxMaa	There is no doubt that they are a great historical team. Most of the Packers "greatness" comes from before the merger and I have a hard time comparing pre-merger to post merger times. The league has changed so much from those days. I pretty much base my opinions on stuff that dates back to the late 60's. Since the merger, the Pack have only been to the Super Bowl twice. The Boys have been eight times. We have/had Texas Stadium and Roger Staubach. The most playoff appearances, most NFC Championships, Most consecutive winning season, and by God, they are America's Team!  All other teams pale in comparison to the Mighty cowboys.|`|QIWvbNFWaa	Well, I am Vikings fan therefore I hate the Packer, but I gotta admits, Packer has good history, including NFL Greatest Coach ever in the Nfl:Vincent Lombardi|`|tzrLDbHWaa	For you Steelers fans to call yourself the greatest team of all time, you'd have to win a little more.  Green Bay has 12 championships to your 6.  Granted 9 of them were before the Super Bowl existed, but if you're going to say ALL TIME, then you mean ALL TIME.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Haha，I knew you were messing around。 I‘ll say that the Packers are the greatest franchise in history though。 Even though I’m a Steelers fan。|`|rM9WzIkHaa	the packers should be kicked out of football and sent to soccer<br>  lol jk<br>  come on it was a joke|`|RS3fjNboaa	Give the Cowboys as many years as the Packers have and they will surpass that.

uJPzCKFTaa	Juan Pablo Montoya...ever notice that when there is a crash or a caution, 9 times out of 10 he's involved somehow?!?!?! Also, I think Dale, Jr. is overrated. People don't like him because he's good, they like him because of his dad.|`|lGfUh1Cjaa	My LEAST favorite would have to be Robby Gordon. Not because of the person he is, but basically because his driving skill has crashed out so many innocent drivers over the years. he has started many of the big ones that has hurt good drivers day.<br>  <br>  others are choosing their least based on the fact that they probably hate a driver who beats out their favorite too often. I admire all the great racers, such as Johnson, Earnhardt, Jeff Grodon, Edwards and so on. Even though they beat my favorite Stewart on many occasions. But what is a sport without competition? Great racers admir their greatest competitor.  It is the Robby Gordons incompetence behind the wheel that has made me hate him most!|`|OmKtUijpaa	I absolutely hate Kyle Busch.

He really was down to earth.Go Carl|`|4uf044sFaa	I generally am more interested on where my driver is, but I also like watching the battle up front if several cars are battling.  If the top 5 cars are each separated by a second or more, I spend 90 percent of the time looking at the top of the screen.  Last week my driver blew up on lap 6 or 7, so I had no choice but to watch the battle up front.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yeah I'm a Kenseth fan.  I have been since he was a rookie.  I was pretty dissapointed lol.|`|OmKtUijpaa	Depends on how many laps are left to go. If we are only twenty five laps in I'll keep a watch on him or maybe just take a quick nap, then when there are about fifteen laps to go and if he's still there that's when i might just give up for him on that race. It also depends on how close the chase is or if he's in the running for the championship or something.|`|9vcZjFl6aa	yes especially if your driver did not quilify well , the handle on his car goes away or had an accident yes 1 and 2 are important but 25,26 are also important  when you are point racing but the key is in my opion is if its a hell of a battle yes !!!!|`|PJhwWVcMaa	I'm always keeping up with my favorite driver but I'm also doing fantasy NASCAR so I'm keeping up with some of the drivers I have on my fantasy team too.

I wanna know if he slides up any or back any!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I do both.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	Alwasy looking for my man to keep moving up if he is not in the lead.  I do get bummed when after about 10-15 laps he hasn't moved up or has gone backwards. Most of the time the action is not in the front anyway it usually is happening from 5th on back.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I do both. I always have track pass on my laptop and I watch my driver and listen to him and watch the race on tv. It's been more fun this year since he has been driving up in the front !|`|y7jE63ULaa	I am only interested in what my driver is doing.

8MUj24s6aa	I like the taurus 24/7s better than Ruger. I own a Sigma and it gave nothing but trouble. Every 3rd round jammed. I have shot the 24/7 in 9mm and it is very comfortable. I would go for the .45acp if this was my choice. .40sw is has too much of a snap in its recoil. .45 is much more smooth. I suggest 9mm if this is your first handgun or have little experience.<br>  <br>  Ruger and Taurus is well made and reliable. The Taurus has a lifetime of the gun warranty. Your great great grandkids can send it in for repairs on Taurus.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	All are decent. I don't like the Rugers because their grips don't feel comfortable in my hand. I also find their safeties to be awkward. Just me.<br>  <br>  The Taurus seems to be getting good reviews. The warranty is lifetime.<br>  <br>  The Sigma: Either you hate it or you love it. There are some who say Smith hasn't made a good auto since the model 39.|`|AA11295048	The Ruger P 95 and the Taurus 24/7 are both excellent choices the Sigma is crap in comparison to both of these weapons, 9mm's are inexpensive to shoot on a regular basis and the best 9mm JHP's are nearly as effective as the .45 acp rounds. Shot placement is the key factor and the 9 allows you more practice time because of the cheaper ammunition.|`|tuULGJS6aa	I'd go for the Ruger in this selection. My experience is that Ruger makes good guns for bargain prices. Smith & Wesson makes good revolvers, but its semi-autos have a spotty record, so I wouldn't risk the price of one, especially the Sigma. The Taurus pistols cost more than the Ruger, but they're not worth more.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	It would be great if you could find a place that would let you test fire all of these.  You need to find the one that fits you the best.  I have the 24/7 pro .45 cal and I love it.  That being said, all of the pistols you mentioned are of good price and quality.|`|IoyJXzoyaa	I just answered this same question for myself recently.  Let me start by saying that there are a lot of PEOPLE who will say to choose .40s&w or .45acp calibur guns over 9mm due to more "stopping power", but most scientific   RESEARCH says with todays modern loads there is no statistical difference in "stopping power" between them.  They are all mediocre at best when compared to shotguns or rifles.<br>  <br>  That being said, I personally went with a ruger p89 9mm with hogue grips.  I choose ruger because of an outstanding reputation for reliabilty, durability, and quality.  They may be a bit heavy and blocky for some, though the newer polymer frame p95 are lighter and smaller, but I personally like having some weight in my hand.  The manual saft is easy to manipulate for me in either hand, and with the rubber hogue grips it fitds like a glove.  Being 9mm also affords me the abilitiy to buy more ammo for the same cost as the bigger guys, and thus hopefully practice more frequently.  In the end, any hand gun is only as effective as where you plkace the bullets, not how big or how many foot lbs. they have.     <br>  <br>  As far as specific advice on your selections, choose the one that has the best feel in your hand and that allows for flawwless operation of trigger safty slides in your primary and off hand, as you never know when you might have to use it...your other hand that is.<br>  <br>  Greg|`|IVxuz1Anaa	All good weapons , what you are doing is a righy step , ask the populas ,ask the experts , try it out , buy the one for you and you will be happy with it . As for my SIGS I treat em right babies and they work well for me .<br>  there are a lot of good weapons out there that might not work well in your hands but there are some that will .|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	I would choose the S@W 40 cal sigma. a 40 has almost as much knock down as a 45 and much more than a 9. The S@W has more ammo capacity then the 9 or 45. And the S@W is more reliable and better built than the Taurus 40.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	Go SIG! Accurate, reliable but expensive!<br>  They are making a 1911 knock-off with match grade barrels.<br>  .45 power that always hits the mark!|`|fXTcFuUjaa	I would say the Ruger would be the most reliable of the three. I had the sigma and Sold it within days- junk

Romo is still way too young.  People forget he only has 39 NFL games under his belt.  I dont know why people are so set on this "playoff game" thing ha.  Ill attach  links that kinda prove the Giants game wasnt Romos fault as well as quotes from Brandon Jacobs who also states it wasnt Romos fault.  Also, people argue now that Drew Brees is the best QB in the NFL.  He is like 1-4 in the playoffs.  Also....if the Falcons lose in the playoffs next year, you think anyne will come in an say "wow Matt Ryan sucks, he cant win a playoff game"?   Na, they wont do that.  He would be 0-2 though, just like Romo!  Here is the link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/2008/01/14/2008-01-14_patrick_craytons_drops_lift_giants-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/footba...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  and here is Jacobs quote<br>  <br>  ""The Cowboys are a great football team and they might have had a chance to win if Patrick Crayton hadn't dropped two key passes," Jacobs said. "Yes, there was a lot of talk. But you know what? We won the game and we're going to Green Bay ... and they're chillin'."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yet its all Romos fault?  Brandon Jacobs happened to be there and played in the game.  I personally watched the game and saw it was Crayton, not Romo who blew the game.  I must be one of the few who saw the game apparently.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Warner<br>  <br>  I wouldn't call Romo a young rising star. I'd call him an almost 30-year-old QB who's already peaked talent-wise.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Well since Kurt Warner can actually win a play off game & lead his team to 3 Super Bowls, he has the edge|`|G5QqijG0aa	I think they are both equally good but neither one is going to be the Caliber of Joe Montana or Dan Marino or Phil Simms or Steve Young  just not the same caliber of star quarterbacks in the league, Best QB in the league right now is Peyton Manning hands down.  No one else in the league can read your defense better than he can.|`|ePeKSqrIaa	could we get a clip of that fumble by romo in the playoffs. I believe it was against seattle.

He is the dog and the trick is the COT car. Some people cannot get used to it no matter how good he is. He will have to go against the best in the sport.

AA10907759	Alley, you'll need to excel in at least two events to be considered for a scholarship - it's tough for them to give a scholarship for 5 points in a meet. Just making the team only requires being good in one event. You should visit the UMass Amherst Track website and see what their throwers are doing now (and check out their "records") because you're throwing the same weight implements that they are (although you may be using a rubber-tip javelin and they wouldn't be). Generally, by the time you are a Junior you want to hit 100+ in the discus, 35+ in the shot, and 120+ in the javelin to "get on the radar" of the college coaches. You can also see if there is a summer throwers camp at UMass so you can meet them. But, realistically you also have to look at your physical qualifications - are you tall, athletic, broad-shouldered? Because unless you're going to hit 40+ in shot, 140+ in discus, and / or 150+ in in jav while in High School, the colleges need to believe that all you lack is some better coaching and some time in the weight room to make you a D-1 thrower. Alley, I would advise you that, as a freshman, you just need to stay focused, get the coaching you need, spend the time in the weight room and hope for good, steady improvement (not unusual to gain 3-5 feet/year in shot and 7-10 in discus and jav). Good luck!|`|WrDGhduxaa	Throwing the discus 80 feet is okay, but the shot needs to be much farther than the 20s.<br>  You don't need to make a highlight for college coaches. Most high school coaches know several college coaches and the college coaches attend state meets to see the events and find athletes.<br>  If you throw well they will know who you are.<br>  You should get involved in summer track with the USATF which has association, region, and national championships.<br>  Doing well in these meets means a lot to college coaches and the international track teams are chosen from the national champions.

Low-ki has been around for nearly 10 years working various indys, ROH, TNA, NJPW.....he has nothing to prove.....he has been ready for "the big time" for years.  I'm guessing the reason why he is in FCW this long would be as a trainer so the "higher ups" can see if TJ Wilson, DH Smith, Escobar, etc. are ready for the next step.<br>  <br>  Low-ki's style maybe different but whose to say that is a bad thing?  I thought the whole point in pro wrestling was to get the fans from sitting on their thumbs to jumping up and down cheering the good guys and booing the bad guys via "OMG WTF" type spots that will amaze and thrill them.  And what's the greatest "new" move in the WWE Universe well its the Warriors Way aka the Bruce Lee double stomp....<br>  <br>  Its time to move on the next big thing is using martial arts as the focal point in pro wrestling.

They identify as being Celtic, which is the source of pride. <br>  <br>  Plus the newspapers in England slate the team and their players when they do bad, and all the English disown them, but in Wales and Scotland they still write about the teams with pride.|`|7XoMIlJeaa	We (Scots) have realistic expectations about what can be achieved unlike England where the media constantly talk about England being potential winners of every competition.   There are probably at least half a dozen countries that I think are ahead of England when competitions come round<br>  Brazil<br>  Argentina<br>  Spain<br>  Portugal<br>  France<br>  Italy<br>  Sweden<br>  Germany<br>  Holland<br>  Also, most of England's matches are played at Wembley which hacks off a lot of fans from outside London whereas in Scotland (a smaller country) Glasgow is much more accessible from most of areas|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Patriotism?

I'll cast a vote for Terry Taylor.<br>  <br>  Don West already has a heel persona with the people he ripped off with those bogus Tiger Woods cards from back in the day. What a snake-oil salesman.

Who knows what will happen in the next 3 games or 10 games.

I think that they can still qualify for the Champions League, though, as long as Arsenal drop a few points.|`|RNr2xeDHaa	* fingers crossed*|`|Y8n3hbN4aa	i reckon man city will pull off a win (or draw) and then arsenal will take over.|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Arsenal are brilliant at shooting themselves in the foot so i wouldnt get carried away just yet.|`|ndqYQGYXaa	They wont drop points tonight.............Hopefully.

This checklist is what we call as camping equipment.<br>  <br>  Proper plan for your packing:<br>  <br>  Packing is the first and important step to a great camping trip. Pack the things according to the checklist so that there is no chance for you to forget anything. This is the best option for remembering all prior to leaving your home.<br>  <br>  Camping shelter and bedding:<br>  <br>  Shelter and bedding are also important aspects of your camping equipment. Shelter for protecting and bedding for having great sleep are important to any camper. If you are planning for an overnight trip before leaving your home, ensure that you packed all the tents and blankets.<br>  <br>  Having the shelter protects you not only from the climate conditions, but also it makes you feel more secure. Blankets help to keep you comfortable and warm during the night. It is better to keep the sleeping bag with you.<br>  <br>  Personal items:<br>  <br>  Ensure that before leaving the home you set all the personal items that you need for your trip. The basic things you need are: soap, toothbrush, shampoo, hair brush, and toilet paper. Also pack few towels and washcloths to have a shower in the morning.<br>  <br>  Clothing:<br>  <br>  Don’t forget to pack enough cloths in your camping equipment. You may not be able to wash your cloths, so it is better to keep at least one outfit for a day. Pack the cloths which keep you warm like warm socks, pants, and warm shirts. Also, keep some rain gear on hand.<br>  <br>  Cooking equipment for your camp:<br>  <br>  Make sure that you pack the necessary food in your camping equipment and also few other things.<br>  <br>  Keep with you all the cooking equipment like, cups, paper plates, utensils, aluminum foil, cutting board, dish washing soap, towels and wash cloths. These are few important things that you require in the forest.<br>  <br>  Emergency equipment:<br>  <br>  Don’t forget to bring your cell phone to the camping trip. It will be very helpful in the case of emergency. Also, keep first aid kit, sunscreen and pest preventer, and a sharp outdoor knife.<br>  <br>  You use these things in your everyday life and I am sure that you need these things in your camping trip also.<br>  <br>  Finally, you have got some idea about the camping equipment that are required for a trip. So, make your camping trip a fun and enjoyable time.|`|eaYtGz9gaa	Your question does not state whether you will be truck/car camping or whether you will be hiking.  However, there are certain things that you will need regardless of your camping style.  First, you need to consider food, shelter, and clothing.  Second, you need to be certain to bring the 10 essentials that you may need in case of a backwoods emergency.  The website below will walk you everything you need for hiking with an ultralight backpack.  If you will be car camping, you can add on whatever creature comforts you like that will fit in your vehicle.  If that is the case, just add to the "basics" that you would be taking backpacking.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	some of what you will need will depend on where you are going camping and for how long; you will definitely need somewhere to sleep, a tent, sleeping bag or cot; a way to make fire is also a necessity, such as matches, flint, etc. make sure you take your choice of beverage, some food and snacks, if you will be cooking your own food, you will need some pots or pans; you will want a flashlight or lantern; also clothes, extra shoes/boots if it is muddy or wet, toilet paper, toiletries, etc.|`|d91775dc0167078dadf8d8093e2a4445aa	cooler, water, ice, sleeping bag, extra clothes , extra shoes, knife, plastic cutlery, fire, tent, sleeping bag, tent,  there's a lot of stuff.  it depends on how comfortable you want to be.|`|tZPOSvHQaa	I would study some survival skills <br>  <a href="http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/wilderness/survival/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/wil...</a><br>  <br>  it don't take long and could save your life|`|lkygFphvaa	Are you car camping or back packing?  Back packing you will only want to bring the things that you need, and those that weigh the least. Plus water proof hiking boots.  What is the weather going to be like?  Hypothermia is no fun, but with the right clothes, sleeping bag, and pad you will be fine.  Good rain gear is a plus, REI or Marmot jacket and pants.  Where are you going?  Some places may be in a draught, and will not allow fires, so you will need to bring stoves to cook on.  If you are going into wilderness, you may want a compass, map, bear bag and rope for hanging your smellables (keeps animals from getting your food, soap, film, garbage, and toothpaste.)|`|uISTGAoLaa	You probably want to make sure you have the following essentials:<br>  <br>  sleeping bag, tent, food & water, first aid kit, flashlight, pocket knife, rain gear, lantern, camping stove for cooking.

mMFJrPbvaa	Well I hope the "forest kind of thing" is actually on your property and doesn't extend onto someone elses before you go making trails. <br>  <br>  Many of the state parks use paint to mark the trail.  A dot or a square is usually painted on a tree that is on the trail.  Ideally you want to mark the furthest possibly tree that is visible from the last marker, not painting every tree that is on the trail. <br>  <br>  Or you can buy a pack of trail markers and nail them onto the tree.  The markers are usually plastic.  When you nail them to the tree make sure you dont nail it tight to the tree because when the tree grows the marker will be "swallowed" by the tree or it will jsut break off.  Leave extra room to allow the trre to grow.  On some of the older trails that are hardly used you will find that they used the tops of soup cans and such.  They usually paint the lids and bottoms of the cans and nailed them to the tree.<br>  <br>  I`d stay away from tape or ribbon because the UV severely degrades it and it`ll last only a summer before it falls apart, in turn blowing into the woods. I cant think of how many times I have come upon degraded "caution" tape or the plastic ribbon used to mark hunting trails etc, obviously it is no longer on the trail if the color is faded and its in pieces on the ground.|`|jjEIZdHyaa	the legend has arrived! in a different colum? anyway try rope
7ImGw976aa	*Not to much because they've had a variety of different types of wrestlers in Money In The Bank. Often the bigger guys haven't won the match because they're not fast and quick as the others, don't do as much high flyer moves, and don't think to much before they act.<br>  *I think he can, most likely gotten trained well. Sadly they just don't over use him as a serious wrestler.<br>  *Definitely yea, she's been well trained and it has been mentioned. They don't really use her though : (  Heard she was one of ta best wrestlers they've got in years, they just make her look weak from storylines for her matches. Plus for some reason haven't had her wrestle for ages now with no reason, she's only recent decided to appear on ECW but doesn't do any fighting.|`|QY4Hy00qaa	1. No I do not think it is stupid for Kane and Mark Henry to be in the Money and the Bank match they earned their spot.<br>  <br>  2. Yes I agree Boogeyman is really talented<br>  <br>  3.Yes she does come  from the Hart family dynasty she should be talented.|`|QMveJrziaa	1. No, they have had a large wrestler in MITB in the past (Kane), and it turned out alright. They are just there to dominate and put over the other talent, Mark Henry will not win, and if Kane won, I would be very happy, and not think that was stupid...<br>  <br>  2. I have not seen him wrestle in a long time, as I do not watch ECW. But he seemed ordinary, nothing special. But he may have improved since I last watched him wrestle.<br>  <br>  3. Yes, she is a very talented wrestler, who deserves a big push.|`|UWJinEbIaa	1.  Kane + ladder match = boring just look at his time when he was champion with Hurricane in the TLC3 match from Smackdown.

Can Mark Henry even climb a ladder?  And if he can, can the ladder survive?<br>  <br>  2. No<br>  <br>  3.  Yes|`|TAPBWPJLaa	1. Not really, I think WWE just wants to add some unpredictability to the match if anything. Also, Henry wouldn't break the ladder. Ladders can support a lot of weight if the person climbs it correctly.<br>  <br>  2. He's alright, but nothing special to me. He's mostly there because of his gimmick.<br>  <br>  3. She is a good wrestler, though some people overrate her too much because of her last name and Hart family association.<br>  <br>  -She does now, yes. The hair color change is helping that. When she had her hair dyed to brunette, she looked worse.|`|Lv89kHKpaa	1) Kane is quite agile and has been in and won ladder matches before, so he'll be OK. Who do they think they were kidding putting Henry against Santino. Henry will not put on a good show. They've had big guys in MITB before (Kane & Bobby Lashley). I think it will be better when they add highflyers to the mix<br>  <br>  2) Yes I do<br>  <br>  3) Yes I do<br>  <br>  BQ: It's not just you|`|HhfqLSXIaa	1)For once I am glad they put two big guys in Money in the Bank.<br>  2)yeah he really is.<br>  3)yes,she is really aggressive.|`|b2yD0TyEaa	yeah yeah|`|02XHxknUaa	One word for all three DEFINITELY!!!!!!!!!!

Ln5XNno3aa	I rented 2k9 and was not impressed at all, the commentary is good but I don't like the game play, I got through 3 innings of a game and quit. 30 Minutes later I was at Game stop buying " The Show" and I cant stop playing, The Show is def the better of the two games.|`|g9P7oWyeaa	MLB THE SHOW. Definitely, its really realistic, the Career mode is quite awesome.

7x4VtGtFaa	Sounds like a Tournament of Champions to me. Inter, Bayern, Boca, Man Utd.<br>  <br>  Oh how the little ones are turning green! LMAO.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	That one IS a Mickey Mouse Cup.  It has no history, it's sponsored by a car manufacturer and it's only purpose is to make money.<br>  <br>  If City were in it and won it, i couldn't defend others saying we won a Mickey Mouse Cup.  The football calendar traditionally starts from August to May.  Anything else after that is not on the football calendar is a Mickey Mouse Trophy as it holds little value.  City compete for the Thomas Cook Trophy every year, it's just a friendly match, nothing more, just like this Audi Cup.|`|N7fNwIQSaa	Apparently the Emirates cup is a mickey mouse cup....but Madrid, Inter, Valencia and Juventus have all played in it!|`|no3tD0OSaa	lol. yes|`|YrL1xSEOaa	That would be right in doing so.That isn't even a proper tournament.|`|b2yD0TyEaa	yes yes yes|`|z5EK19s5aa	lol they will call it a mickey mouse cup only if scousers are in it|`|FFE9Qztzaa	As the official Sponsor, I announce that Yes, it IS a Mickey mouse cup <br>  :))<br>  <br>  _* I must agree with English Knight.

tIBZ9Gi3aa	I'd say he's confident,not arrogant.Confident is when you know that you're a good player and are not afraid to say it.Arrogant is when you publicly state that you should be first choice,while only able to score against bottom-placed teams.|`|7x4VtGtFaa	There's a thin line between Arrogance and Self Belief.

AA12362958	I'm a old timer, still believe Gerrard can perform better with and when Torres is fit! Sure he would and should be playing in the center. We should still stick to 4-4-2, it doesn't matter who's playing alongside Torres (he's the 1st choice striker, the rest are, the most, 2nd choice, Kyut inclusive, even though he's almost certainly to be 1 of the 1st to be on the 1st team list anytime!)<br>  <br>  Gerrard like and thrive when he's given free role. Alonso and Mascherano can be the defensive MF.<br>  <br>  Ngog scored in the last match but he's still not 1st team player yet. He's improving. If he keep his cool and improve on reading the game, he can overtake Ryan's position!<br>  <br>  Ngog- sound like And Goals! Good Omen!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Are you kidding?<br>  <br>  If it weren't for a "stevie g" misheader and a keeper fumble would you have won?  Still no creativity or imagination in the side and never will be|`|Pfq2zRejaa	did anyone else notice ? you mean son|`|no3tD0OSaa	hahaaa.. Maybe pass a note to Rafa then|`|jiFHJ6daaa	SIngle striker doesnot work.............man utd....chelsea........all work with two strikers...............|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Exactly what I thought. Gerrard was back to his best in the central role, where he can really influence the game and take matters into his own hands. Vintage Gerrard display...something we haven't seen all season. The formation worked wonders going forward as well. Did you notice how we didn't get behind the Sunderland defence once when we switched to 4-5-1?<br>  <br>  As for N'Gog, he had a great game with the assist and the goal, but I wasn't entirely convinced. But it was a good performance.
nJ5kceMBaa	Ha ha. Didn't do bad did he. Didn't really get tested much though. I wouldn't like to see him play there against Madrid, and besides, we need him at CM playing like a monster like he did in the first leg =)|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	his great i called him the terrier because he is as relentless as my jack russel with a football, could work on his temper though.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Hargreaves did better, Masc is also good but I think Bosingwa, Sanga are the best.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No, Bacary Sagna is|`|aB4n96vhaa	no he is garbo at right back and in midfield come to that|`|V4STBjyFaa	obviously not or he would be playing ther every every week soft lad|`|b2yD0TyEaa	Best right back is Wayne Bridge|`|jiFHJ6daaa	vvveeeeeerrrryyyyyyyyyyyy funny
XLXncQu9aa	Manny is the bigger whiner.  Jay Cutler had a good reason to be upset.  The Broncos wanted to trade him despite the fact that the organization had said he was their guy.  As an organization you must stand by your QB until they give you a reason not to.  He hasn't given them a good reason to let him go.  Manny's issue is that he is greedy.  He just wants a larger contract.  Manny isn't that great of a player in my eyes.  He could do better if he really wants a better contract.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Jay Cutler ,Manny at least wins titles!|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Cutler by a mile.  Manny is a world champion and one of the top three right hand hitters the game has ever seen.  He understands this is a business and is letting his agent get whatever the market will hold on his behalf.  In light of America's economic condition you might say that is insensitive, but he is not crying...It called negotiations.  Cutler, a one time pro-bowler feels that he is above being moved or discussed and carries a sense of accomplishment beyond his performance on the field with each statement he makes ("my arm is stronger than Elway's")...please, it's a business your personal feeling shouldn't be brought to the table.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Manny to me isn't as big a cry baby as people make him out to be, and this is coming from a New York fan. He's a kid at heart in my opinion, he pouts in times of frustration but basks in the glory and has fun in times of success.<br>  <br>  Even on a good statistical day, Cutler finds something to complain about or somebody to call out on another team. He needs to grow up.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Manny. <br>  <br>  Cutler is still young, and has alot of maturing to do.|`|AA10776364	Manny no question.  All he sees are dollar signs.|`|jpWtZUEqaa	Why should Cutler be considered a cry baby? He's got a real gripe with Denver. How would you feel if your new boss called you into his office and told you that you had a future with his company and he was looking forward to working with you, but then you find out from someone outside your company that your new boss was going to fire you for a new a guy,who isnt as good as you are at your job, but didnt because the new guy choose another company? You'd be in a pretty bad mood.|`|2bGR2WDmaa	i am no bronco fan, but if a team doesn't want you...do you really want to play for them!?!  Remember, this is a new GM and coach that were actively trying to get another player to come in and play QB...what kind of commitment does Cutler have to make with people that don't want him from the get go<br>  <br>  Manny doesn't cry, he only plays when Manny wants to play|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	manny, easily.  he's just a selfish little b*stard.  who passes up 45M for 2 years?  i'll be laughing real hard when he's not playing at all this season cause his 'needs' couldn't be met by any teams.<br>  <br>  cutler has a right to be pissed, at least about this latest incident.  i don't know what his excuse has been in the past though.|`|wd7XuvKnaa	Jay Cutler obviously. Manny isnt even crying....Scott Borris (his agent) is the one is being greedy and trying to negotiate for more money.<br>  <br>  Cutler is the bigger baby for taking everything so Personally. The NFL is a Business, he has to understand that.|`|daRDQE9maa	Jay Cutler has the right to be up set. He's a pro bowl Quarterback and doesn't deserve to be just shipped off like that.. but it is a buisness he just needs to keep it to his self and let his manager do the talking and just do his job.... play quarterback where ever you may be...|`|d0c38f1aaab70e366c43164878682f34aa	Philip Rivers is a bit-see-h<br>  <br>  Jay is a team player and a very good player, he just was in a horrible team.<br>  <br>  Manny, meanwhile, wants too much at that age.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	I'll go with Jay Cutler. He didn't get traded. (WHATS THE BIG DEAL!) He's exactly where he wants to be.He's blessed to be playing a GAME and getting payed (very well I might add) to do it.|`|ZC3bWRPnaa	NIce pic sexy, call me   903-306-9401<br>  <br>  <br>  They both are equal pansies.|`|qNf0A4V4aa	Manny. he should be lucky to be in our country, let alone crying for 100 million dollars. but that is why i don't watch baseball anymore. i don't own a spanish/english dictionary.|`|4rFCesSsaa	Manny is bigger because at least I understand why Cutler is upset.|`|VzEO7cILaa	Yes it is Manny , and he just got his damn deal he is on his way to L.A. sports radio just announced it out here .|`|SEt1Znktaa	cutler is so beast... manny on the other hand is the biggest sissy in the MLB... he needs to grow up|`|1zgmu2zJaa	Me!!! im cryin cuz I WANT YOUR BOD  =] lol <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -bree|`|GZ2ROSEHaa	Cutler is usually a hot head who whines about every little thing, but I have to say that manny is being the bigger cry baby right now.  Cutler is and has been the Broncos #1 qb for some time now, they have committed to him.  To want to trade him in order to get Matt Cassel, a mediocre quarterback who has yet to really prove himself in the NFL (keep in mind he was playing with the 2 best receivers and the best OL in the game) is both insane and distasteful towards Cutler. So I can understand why he would be upset with the trade talks, especially if he was not told of the Broncos interest in a three-way deal.  <br>  <br>  As far as Manny is concerned, he is the biggest baby of them all because he has been offered so much money and it's not good enough.  He whined and got traded from the Red Sox.  He cries until he gets what he wants.

You will see the 20 car way more competitive in the 2nd half of the season after Logano gets more seat time and is better able to relay what he needs to Zippy.

Both drivers are talented, but I think Joey will have the edge.  I think the last time the ROTY run came down to the last race was when Ryan Newman and Jimmie Johnson were battling for it back in 2002, and I think Ryan Newman won the ROTY then.  The 2000 race was exciting too with Dale Jr and Matt Kenseth.  There might have been some other recent ones but those are the only ones that come to mind.|`|c16PCaCmaa	I have to go with Speed, just based on his experience.  I think that in the future, Joey will be more successful than Speed, but at this point he is too green to be competitive.  If he had a year of N'wide, or trucks, or even ARCA under his belt, I would have a different opinion.  But I think he has come to the cup level at the wrong time.|`|LXwfR3Ofaa	By the end of the year, the "equipment" will be a huge decider. Logano...by a large margin. Speed will be good, but equipment is not there and Logano is just as talented.|`|PJhwWVcMaa	Speed is currently outside the top 35 in owners points and Logano just had a top 15 finish at Las Vegas. I think Logano will end up winning ROTY.|`|9vcZjFl6aa	it not because i like the redskins its not cuz' we share the same first name but i think logano cuz he has more resources and the coach|`|Aw2oxQnuaa	I think Logano will get it, but I would sure like to see Speed get it and show people what sliced bread is really about.

So i dont know if he had a life jacket on. If he didnt have the life jacket on that could explain the floating life jacket they found.But ya never know miracles can happen. I still have hope.|`|nA6mcmFNaa	Odds are they drowned and sank. The coast guard did find another life preserver and a cooler - 18 miles from the boat. Saying sharks ate them is an exaggeration, as there would be some left. Sharks don't eat bodies whole. <br>  <br>  It is unfortunate but drowning is probably the cause and they may (probably won't) ever find the bodies.|`|Sp8G92XEaa	there is a chance of them still being alive, you can be unconcious with a life jacket on.|`|AA11519172	Hopefully they wont pop up on a popular beach.

SvmRWwepaa	I just grip the ball little much towards my left and i keep sim also widish.. Just try that u will also get fine result|`|wYHwIShFaa	i swinger my ball like leg swinger|`|Y5RDEkElaa	An outswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam vertical and the first two fingers running along either side of the seam. Once the ball has worn and been polished so that one side is rougher than the other, the rough side is placed on the left (as seen from the bowler's viewpoint). When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the seam so that it points slightly to the left as well, and releases the ball rotating about a horizontal axis with the seam along the rotational "equator". The angle of the seam to the direction of motion produces an aerofoil effect as the ball moves through the air, pushing it to the left. This is enhanced by differential air pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces, which also tends to push the ball to the left. The result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left.<br>  <br>  The outswinger is where the ball swings (moves) away from the batsmen. This ball is a useful weapon to a bowler's armoury. The outswinger tempts the batsmen into playing at the ball, hopefully hitting the edge of the bat as the batsmen miss-judges the ball, causing a catching chance. Key factors in bowling an outswinger include . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br>  *Ball position *Seam position *Grip *Delivery action *Wind direction <br>  <br>  Ball position: The ball position is a key element in swinging the cricket ball. The ball will swing towards the rough side of the ball. This is due to a greater wind resistance on the rough surface of the ball compared to the smooth, shiny side of the ball. When bowling to a right hand batsman, the rough side of the ball should face towards the off-side of the field (left hand side of the ball). This will cause the ball to move away from the batsmen. When bowling to a left hand batsman, the rough side of the ball should face to the off-side of the field, meaning the rough side will be on the right hand side of the ball. <br>  <br>  Seam Position: The seam position helps produce swing, depending on which way it's pointing. For an outswinger, the seam should face first or second slip. <br>  <br>  Grip: The grip incorporates the ball and seam position. Bowling to a right handed batsmen, the rough side of the cricket ball should face the off-side of the field (left hand side of the ball), with the seam position facing towards first or second slip. This will cause the cricket ball to swing away from the batsmen, hopefully catching the edge of the bat. To a left handed batsmen, the rough side of the ball should be facing the off-side (right hand side of the ball), with the seam position facing towards first or second slip. <br>  <br>  Delivery Action: A side on action with the arm coming across the body when following through the crease after bowling the ball will aid in producing an outswinger cricket delivery. <br>  <br>  Wind Direction: The direction of the wind will help assist the ball to swing. The ball will tend to swing in the direction of the wind. When the wind comes across from right to left, when bowling to a right handed batsman, the ball will tend to swing away from the batsmen (outswinger). <br>  <br>  Summary: *Aim rough side towards batsmen's off-side to produce swing away from the batsmen (outswinger) *Position seam away from the batsmen *Side on action with the arm coming across the body when following through *Cricket ball will swing in the direction of the wind. <br>  <br>  Hopefully these pointers will help you produce an outswinger delivery. Good luck with your cricket.
G6KNZIVTaa	It probably won't be D-Wade. I mean sure he's having a great season, his stats are great and he's playing great ball, but his team isn't connecting like the Lakers and Cavaliers. The Heat should be at least top 3 with their roster.<br>  <br>  The race is between Kobe and LeBron. My bet's on LeBron though because other than Mo Williams he's got no help on his team.

2ece24deba6e7760d2c205b331e95863aa	The federal government does not require any kind of permit or license to own a silencer.  38 states allow unlicensed civilians to own silencers, but Iowa is not one of them.  According to chapter 724.2 of Iowa law only police, military, corrections officers, licensed dealers and manufacturers, museums, licensed collectors of relics and re-enactors using relics can own silencers.  Look here; <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=IowaCode" rel="nofollow">http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-IC...</a> and search for chapters 724.1 and 724.2. <br>  <br>  You can obtain the federal firearms license ($200/3 yrs), pay the special occupational tax ($500/yr) and I think you would also need the ITAR (export license $2250 per year), then you can make or buy silencers in Iowa.  While the FFL/SOT can make an unlimited number of silencers, they have to keep their licenses current or get rid of them all.  This is not a good way to go about owning silencers for personal use.  Better you move to another state like AL, AR, AK, AZ, CO, CT, FL, GA, ID, IN, KS, KY, LA, ME, MI, MD, MS, MT, NE, ND, NV, NH, NM, NC, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WV, WI, or WY. <br>  <br>  In the 38 states that allow civilians to own them, all it takes is a bit of paperwork and a tax to satisfy the federal laws.  I make my own silencers on a lathe in my garage.  I download the ATF form 1 (application to make and register firearms), get the local sheriff to sign it, then send it in with form 5330.20, my photos, fingerprints and a check for $200.  This is a one time tax, but is paid each time a silencer is made or transferred.  The ATF approves all tax stamp applications that are filled out correctly, usually in 2-3 months.  To buy a silencer, the process is the same except the ATF form 4 is used.  It is easier but more time consuming than getting a driver’s license.<br>  <br>  Ranb|`|74Z162zmaa	MURDERERER!!!

But you also have to consider, that since he started so late is also the reason why he is still playing at such a high level at his current age, so it is give and take.<br>  <br>   I think, in the next 2 seasons, if he finishes out with 28+ TDs like he has been doing for Arizona, there should be no question he is an HoFer.

40kCOPicaa	yes, when Torres was injuried now he can step in to partner with Kuyt to spearhead the attack, he could be the turning point towards liverpond's title chasing.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	lol, lets hope so|`|Hiasgb75aa	Ngog was OK but I still don't see anything special within him to be a starter for a Top 4 team.

YIuJ3ZxLaa	I think they should keep looking so the family could have closure(god forbid if they are passed). We really don't know if they are alive only God does! Keep them in your prayers!|`|XLXncQu9aa	The thing is, when dealing with missing cases like this one, you have a small window of opportunity that you can find someone alive.  The first thing to realize is that the water was very cold according to reports.  I heard that the water ranged in the mid to lower 60's which isn't comfortable.  Secondly the longer they are in the water the more likely it is that they died from hypothermia or that they drowned.  The rescue crews are trying to be realistic.  Yes its good to be optimistic, but in reality you must know when it is time to stop searching.  If they were still alive they would have been found by now by someone by passing.  Its likely they have died by drowning or freezing to death.  I agree that it is a terrible situation, but reality says the longer it takes to find them the more likely it is they didn't survive.  But you have to give those rescuers credit because they did try their best.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	I think they should see if the survivor can tell them WHAT DIRECTION the two others were headed when he saw them separate from the boat...and then comb THAT DIRECTION...and go by what the wind direction was that day...They would know that...They're the damn Coast Guard...<br>  <br>  I mean, he said a Coast Guard helicopter shined a light RIGHT ABOVE WHERE THEY ALL WERE on the first night...Just missed them, apparently...That is really tragic...<br>  <br>  I wonder if the people on here saying it would be a waste of resources would say THAT if it were THEIR family members lost at sea...|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Reality-They froze/drowned/were attacked by scary fish or some other calamity.<br>  <br>  Reality-If they haven't been found now, odds are they'll never be<br>  <br>  Therefore, they should stop looking. Waste of resources trying to find the bodies in an ocean.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	Yeah, it seems pretty cold that they woulld just COMPLETELY stop looking for them. I hope the bodies (at the very least) would be found for their families sake.|`|daRDQE9maa	Yeah, I agree that they are probley dead, but i beleive that they should still be found. They deserve a proper barial... if indeed are dead...|`|bIbyAkHPaa	I suppose you think we should still be searching for Amelia Earhart too?<br>  <br>  The best searchers on the planet combed 24,000 sq. miles! They are gone.|`|GZ2ROSEHaa	I'm not sure if you know what an ocean is, but its a body of water that stretches over hundreds of miles.  It's been about three days now and it would be almost impossible for them to have survived for that long.  If they didn't die from hypothermia, then they most likely drowned.  As it has been said many times, it is like finding a needle in a haystack.  It is terrible what has happened, but everyone needs to face reality.  Even one of the parents has accepted reality and has begun to get papers ready to declare his son legally deceased.<br>  <br>  I can understand that you feel empathy for the people because it is a terrible situation, but it is a waste of resources and a lost cause.|`|Bs3yr1Gvaa	Okay, yes there is a reality in all this that the common likelihood is that yes they are dead. But we dont know that. Just like somone else posted the guy said a helicopter was right over them and didnt see them. The ocean is very big its possible to miss. I do applaud the coast guards efforts and that they found one person. But also u can take into consideration the water can take you far far out into sea, especially with high waves and rough waters. I think if people start searching on there own.. search in places where the professionals wouldnt think they were... I believe in the reality that they probably are dead but you never know.|`|SEt1Znktaa	they did.... just today

mJFgCvYlaa	Yes it does, for cars it adds about 1/2 horsepower, and mopeds a bit less. Even for runners, the Adidas stripes give you a little boost. For bicycles, if your frame has a stripe painted across, it give you just as much aerodynamics effect as tri-spoke wheels. I have two stripes painted on my laptop and it boots up fasterer. Why do you think all the race cars, racers of all kind have a stripe?? People need to realize the power of the stripes it gives you.|`|ChzeqFjlaa	I highly doubt it. Maybe I should put racing stripes on my stomach so I will run faster for track.|`|AA11828439	That is a ridiculous and idiotic assertion. Stay in school.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	The first racing stripe I saw was on one Ford's first GT-40's.It was an overpowered, ill handlong beast, with a forward seating position, and a rounded nose. Therefore, it was impossible to tell when the thing was going straight. Somebody painted a stipe out in front of the steering wheel down the nose for a refference. When the driver kept the car going in a straight line it went faster. Yes in that case it made the car faster. The car won, and everybody had to have a stripe.
IudQftm4aa	Don't listen to that guy, this is the right spot to find info on dirt biking and passing knowledge that can further our sport. <br>  I think its awesome that you are willing to conquer you fear about dirt biking. Do not try to focus on fear. Fear is good, it keeps you aware and alert. My Dad once told me the moment you get comfortable and fearless is the moment you are gonna get hurt. Fear  and danger is what makes it fun. But if you take it slow and learn at your own pace the nerves will  pass.<br>  Just make sure you have protective gear on. Most importantly is buy a good helmet(Name brand). Have your head measured to ensure proper fit. Then just get the usual. Chest protector, boots,knee pads, elbow guards, goggles,gloves, and maybe a neck protector.<br>      I would start of with a trail bike like a 150f or a ttr125 just till you get the basics down, and if you end up not liking it you are not out that much money.<br>  Good luck!|`|07bqyxdmaa	if its a dirt bike..<br>  <br>  just jump on and go..<br>  <br>  you'll have lots of fun!|`|gd5XGTakaa	welll i have been riding my whole life and i'm a guy and i don't remember my first fears... i'm 16. and 6'1'' i ride a 250 it is like perfect size for me.. i would say a 125 but really it is something you have to see for your self.. you sit on a bike and if you can barely touch the ground with your toes the bike is perfect... i just got in a really bad crash a couple months ago that left me in the hospital for two days and some memory loss... all i ended up getting was a severe concussion and like cronic back problems.. it was on a quad.. the best safety tips are don't go fast on roads you don't know.. and get a helmet that fits everywhere on your head. like no spaces that feel like nothing there and no places where it is really tight... and don't get a helmet like bell or hjc.... i went down a 50 foot cliff and got stopped by my head hitting an oak tree i was wearing an hjc... get a shoei or an arai.... good luck you will get used to it... i just rode a quad for the first time since and it was pretty scary but i was just as good it wore off after the first fifteen minutes or so....|`|LDVEzHsvaa	You will be better posting this question here :<br>  <br>  Home > Cars & Transportation > Motorcycles<br>  <br>  This section here is just for racing question that all !<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, I know there are lots of really good people in the transport section who will help you out a lot.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Have you ever considered that riding a motorbike may not be for you.  Anyone who is so scared that they are asking for advice on a site like this is not someone who should be on a motorbike.  <br>  <br>  Personally I hate heights and there is no way I am going to take up cliff climbing.  <br>  <br>  Doing something just because your boyfriend does it is not a good reason.  <br>  <br>  If you have a passion to ride motorbikes and that is the reason you want to learn then that is okay but when you are obviously very scared, then why would you bother.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  <br>  Fears about riding a motorbike are not irrational and anyone who does ride will tell you that it is not a case of if you get hurt it is when.  <br>  <br>  Whether you are capable of overcoming fear of being injured only you know.<br>  If you intend to ride then I hope you get in plenty of seat time before riding near anyone else as I know I hate it if there is someone who is obviously terrified and they get in the way of a rider who does know what they are doing.  It is just an accident waiting to happen.
Ln5XNno3aa	Just sim allot. once you get moved to the third line you have about 5-6 more games to sim before you get traded, or placed on waivers.

qyATAaeXaa	GSM based cell phones usually have good reception at K-1, Snowshed, Ramshead, and Bear. My reception at Skyeship Base has always been sketchy. I have no idea what Verizon or Nextel reception is throughout the resort. My buddy's Nextel has always worked on the Gondola and at the K-1 base and Snowshed. There are dead zones all around the resort though. <br>  <br>  Cingular should work because Most VT GSM signal towers are Unicell, which is an ATT/Cingular partner.|`|pDf7B5Vmaa	I beleive it would depend most on your cell carrier. In the past i have had sprint and had reception on certain areas on the mountain itself, and always had it in the town and lodges there. While friends of mine have had other carriers and have gotten better reception than me on the mountain. It should be good, but the cold will drain your battery and make your phone slow like most people know.
bfeQ3miMaa	If the Lions were smart they would take Curry.  He's clearly the best player in the draft.  But they will take Stafford.  None of the quarterbacks in this year's draft I think are "franchise" quarterbacks and taking any of them with the first overall pick is a waste.|`|daRDQE9maa	I don't think either. Curry will drop to Kansas city and Mathew Stafford is just over rated... I think the Lions take Offensive lineman from Baylor or Monroe.. They need to boast their offensive line up. They aren't in a need of a quarterback if he can't stay up and stay healthy and they can't run the ball without an o line... So there for I think that for them an o line is best.. helps them run helps them throw... BEST CHOICE!|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Jason Smith- OT Baylor. it is starting to look like they can come back later and get a QB, or better yet, wait for Bradford next year.|`|GZ2ROSEHaa	the lions will take stafford without a doubt|`|hAbH5Jcwaa	well what they need to do is draft down to the 10 11 spot maybe get a 3 round pick bc this years QB prospects kind of suck maybe draft a decent o linemen or w/e whoever they will pick will help them|`|ivXc3xypaa	They need a steady quarterback more than anything, so I think they'll go for Matthew Stafford.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Bluegills are much more round in shape and are generally more of a goldish tint.  Bluegills are members of the sunfish family and have dark blue markings by their gill covers.  Crappie are more elongated, with a head that narrows more down to the mouth than bluegills.  Crappie are generally larger and have a greenish tint to them and their mouths open much wider, more similar to bass.

nA6mcmFNaa	I think the Chiefs got a pretty good deal. <br>  <br>  Instead of using their 1st round pick to draft a QB and have to sign him to 50+ million dollar contract, they gave up far less and signed Cassel, who has 1 year of starting under his belt. So really they were hedging their bets. If cassel doesnt work it isnt nearly as bad as your 1st round pick QB tanking. <br>  <br>  I was of the opinion they should stick with Thigpen, dump LJ, and retool their defense. But things could be worse. You could be my cowboys and be in complete denial thinking things will work out with TO still in the lockeroom.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	Their off season moves are monumental for a team trying to rebuild, and when they trade LJ and Gonzales(hopefully not) they'll get more draft picks and personnel to add to the team being built by the best GM of the decade in Scott Pioli. Cassel is smart and he's shown he could manage a team and Vrabel will add experience and Consistency to a very young Chiefs Defense. And on top of all this, the Chiefs don't have to worry about gambling with a 1st round QB pick, they can grab curry and add to the good young talent already on that team.<br>  <br>  Good Moves.|`|GMCXWfXeaa	now see i am a patriots fan and i like matt cassel cause he did exactly what brady did ( but he would have won the superbowl) and mike vrabel is also a great player but yes the chiefs did good but the chiefs better watch out during next season cause this time brady wont go down without a fight|`|dbpq1wGDaa	Getting Matt Cassell was huge!|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	KC got a starting QB and a serviceable linebacker, and didn't have to give up the #3 pick.<br>  <br>  Well done by anyone's standards.|`|Imehpb4Faa	boo Matt C. should have gone to the 49ers lets hope we get Kurt Warner then or Mark Sanchez

UQLNP6iyaa	Assuming the knee is completely healed then the only logical reason he should be worse is if he's scared of re-injury. That would cause him to be wary of twisting and planting the leg hard when throwing and could affect his overall power. He was never going to be a mobile quarterback so he's not going to be scared of being hit while running, because he rarely runs at all. <br>  <br>  However, and this is the major concern, if he mentally dwells on the possibility of the knee getting hurt again, then he's likely to flinch under pressure rather than try to get off a last second throw before being hit. This involuntary flinching is common in players returning from horrific injury and an example is Duante Culpepper during his Dolphins and Raiders seasons. He might as well have still been injured those 2 years.|`|44IT2kmNaa	Everyone who says he is done seem to have one thing in common, they are not doctors and have no understanding of the injury. <br>  Although the tears are painful when they happen, you can completely recover from them. There is no reason to believe he will be any less effective when he returns than he was before the injury.|`|AA10939368	I do not believe he is done, however, if he sustains an overwhelming or awkward hit he most likely will be done.  It will also depend upon how well his line protects him. There are many Patriots fans who believe he will return to form, not with this type of injury. There is never a 100% recovery.  As far as the superbowl I would not even speculate at this point, there are too many variables in the offseason and the regular season.  The ability to overcome adversity is the key factor, as there were many teams with multiple injuries this past season including the Steelers.  Injuries are not an excuse.    .|`|mUG8XtNpaa	His days of 50 TD passes and 4806 yards are over. Once you hit 30 years of age, your body cannot physically put as much effort forth as it did say, straight out of high school or college. <br>  <br>  Does this mean Brady will come out and suck this upcoming season? Absolutely not. He's always been blessed with a very accurate arm and reads defenses better than arguably any QB today except Peyton Manning. But his versatility in the pocket (ala Ben Roethlisberger) won't be there, and as good as he is, "the game must go on" as they say, the big hits will still be there, and Brady's state of health is now a bigger concern than it was when he winning New England their three Super Bowls.<br>  <br>  If I had to predict the type of season Brady will have this year, I would give him a 65% completion, 38-3900 yards, 35 TD and 15 or so INT's.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I don't think he'll be done but it is unlikely he'll ever return to his 2007 form after his injury.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	he's far from done...he never took that many sacks with his O-Line to begin with so getting hit alot isnt a concern,..that was just one fluke sack against kc, it just happened to end his season|`|nA6mcmFNaa	1 - Brady's injury is with his knee and leg. He is not a quarterback who relies on his mobility to buy time. I don't see this being much of an issue, really, short of him just getting back into playing shape and knocking some rust off (yes I realize QB's generate power through their legs, but I would be more concerned if it was his right knee and not his left. Damage to his right knee would affect his ability to push off and/or step up in the pocket to make long throws).<br>  <br>  2 - He will still have Randy Moss and Wes Welker. I am not saying he will throw 50 TD's but he should be pretty solid. <br>  <br>  I think the answer really depends on: what shape the receiving corps is in, the O-line is in, and the running game is in when Brady returns.|`|GZ2ROSEHaa	davidrzr, you realize that quarterbacks use their legs for more than just movin around in the pocket right? when you throw a ball you use your legs to generate power, etc.<br>  <br>  as far as Brady is concerned, I think he will be alright.  He won't be in top form but he will do a good enough job.  It is usually hit or miss with these injuries, just look at Carson Palmer.  After he tore his knee up in '05 he had pretty good years after that as far as stats go.  It kills me to say it since I am a Jets fan, but Brady has enough talent around him to bounce back.|`|M2Cx9uqzaa	belichick would not have traded cassel (for a second round pick at that) if he didnt know something that the rest of us dont. i have a feeling that brady is going to be just fine.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	Everyone is saying he's done?

QTd8MVDjaa	The minimum for a m130, you would need metal gears, metal bushings, metal spring guide, and maybe a better piston head. I know JG guns have metal gears, but I'm not sure about the other parts so I'd do some research and see what parts they have and upgrade the ones that are needed.

Ln5XNno3aa	It all depends on how hard you grip/ throw the ball, I had the same problem in high school. Try this, take a baseball and put it in your pitching hand, take your middle finger as it rests on the ball (just like you grip it to throw a curve ball) and flick your middle finger upwards. This should shoot the ball upwards out of your hand causing it to spin like a curve ball, keep doing this exercise, and the next time you throw a live curve do the same thing when you release the ball. It worked for me.|`|e6TD1j1gaa	You're right... Probably mechanics. Make sure your fingers are coming over the ball when you release it, and then focus on the wrist snap.

AA11209233	When you play inside, you have a hard court to launch from so you can jump higher.  When you play in sand or on grass, part of the energy from your jump pushes the sand down.  In addition, you have sun, wind and rain that could factor in when you play outside.<br>  <br>  One big difference between court volleyball and beach volleyball is the number of players.  Because there is so much more space to cover, you'll see a lot more amazing dives in outdoor volleyball.  But to see what volleyball is all about--working to get a pass that leads to a kill--the hardcourt game is more real because it is so much harder to find an empty spot on the floor to hit when six people are defending it.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Better is a subjective term.

NnsizqH2aa	I never really lost faith in the arts, but there was a short time when I wondered about its efficacy in modern times. Let me explain.<br>  * Long ago, back in like 1980 (after I had already been in the arts for like 4 or 5 years), I had this strange experience. I had rushed to stop an attack against a friend of mine. Once I had knocked the attacker away, it suddenly occurred to me that I could beat this guy (had already several times, but he was always ready to fight; he even attacked me once during a b-ball game, just cuz I was winning). For some inexplicable reason, I put my hands down, let this idiot tackle me & had this surreal moment of watching people around us as he tried to pound me. When I was tired, I literally reversed his mount and got up.<br>  * It took me some time to get over that. The traditional PACIFIST ethic of the arts had taken hold of me, & then the clarity of it left me in the days/ weeks that followed. I came to doubt MYSELF more than the arts, then overcompensated by getting into more fights than normal. I went through this phase of modifying the systems I had learned, switched from Kung Fu to Judo & Kenpo, and boxed almost every other wk-end by joining all 3 local Boxing orgs. It was a period of about 5 years.<br>  * What the experience taught me was two things. One, that not all Asian philosophy is conducive to our modern lives, esp. in the constant counter-conditioning away from aggression & assertiveness we find in the arts. 2nd, that a single mistake can take years to recover from internally. That kind of insight made me a much better teacher/ coach in the yrs that followed. I take my role as an MA teacher much more seriously than most men do because of this, esp. concerning self-defense (which really came in handy when I entered law enforcement & later started teaching police cadets).<br>  * I know that the arts work when needed. I have used them on countless occasions, though my fighting rarely looks much like my training. However, most MA instruction is not realistic to combative situations.<br>  * The martial arts themselves are not flawed. It is the mindset of the men and women that teach it that has become warped and flawed. <br>  * For instance, many MA people today like to quote Taoism, a philosophy that is concerned greatly w/ longevity, with all of its mystical teachings focusing on prolonging life. This is completely opposite of the mindset needed for winning battles. It leads to a defensive attitude/ application that prolongs your conflict. By allowing this pacifist Taoism to become a major influence in our arts, teachers have weakened the warrior spirit (the "killer spirit" as Paul Vunak calls it) that students crucially need to develop.<br>  * You can't train defensively & expect to be assertive in combat, as MM said in his "Book of Five Rings." On the traditional kamae (stances/ positions), Musashi said not to think of them as merely methods of standing, but as parts of the process of cutting. On blocking, he said that if one trains to block day in & day out, he will not be automatic in cutting. So, Musashi showed that he considered the very beginning levels to be the most important days of training, since they establish the rhythm/ response that would flow from the student for years to come.<br>  * Modern schools do not train as Musashi & other great warriors did. They think in terms of basic, intermediate & advanced teachings, with each being largely different. Musashi said that there should be no "interior" or "exterior" to your teachings, no lower or higher principles, but that the most practical/ tactical methods be taught from day one to promote & maintain the proper spirit needed for war.<br>  * Today, when MA teachers choose the students they will allow to teach, they generally do so by measure of displayed skill alone, not thinking that skill displayed in the dojo is never what will actually take place in real fights. This is not the way that it should be done, not in warrior arts. This is why tournaments were such an important part of training & ranking back in the 60s and 70s, since it mimicked the randori/ kumite requirements found in Asian training.<br>  * Musashi chose his most famous student (for whom he wrote the "Book of Five Rings") because the man had no fear of death. Terao Magonojo was a lowly stone-cutter when Musashi met him, but slept each night w/ his sword held (blade pointed down to his face) by a string. He fell asleep and woke each day facing the lethal edge of the blade, allowing him to be the only man in thousands that could unflinchingly meet Musashi's gaze when kensei surveyed the troops.<br>  * This is the failing of modern MA teachers, that they fail to develop spirit first & foremost. Spirit is more important than anything else to the warrior. Think on this.|`|mTxLvmRkaa	I think thats a legitimate question. With martial arts, you have to adapt what you learn to realistic street fighting. You have to, because most styles really wont teach it. Instructors generally teach a dojo form of self defence which just wont work in the real world. That does not mean giving up your martial art, but it means taking what youve learnt and really thinking about how you would use this in the street.<br>  <br>  If your martial art can not be adapted to genuine combat situations then there is something lacking in your instructors, in which case you should change schools. Or in your own skill level in which case you should train more and open your horizens to what other martial arts practice and widen your martial arts knowledge.|`|6p9I889Iaa	I can only assume from your question that you're part of the vast majority who's training in complete B.S.

But I keep at it, because I believe there's more to it than being able to use it on the street.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately, I hope I never have to use it in a real life situation, because there's usually other elements and variables that no amount of training will help you with.  But if you've been training for a long time, I think you'll discover that you're a lot stronger than you may think.  <br>  <br>  Losing your faith in martial arts is a good thing.

The primary difference is the maximum power level of the gun (which is important if you're even vaguely considering using it for hunting/pest control) and the quality/durability of the gun. <br>  <br>  The Daisy 880 is cheap. It works. It will put lead on target at reasonable ranges with reasonably accuracy. I can get about 1.5 inch groups at 50 feet offhand with a scoped rifle, which isn't bad considering I'm out of practice and I need to adjust the scope a bit. Daisy claims a velocity of 665 fps for a theoretical muzzle energy of around 7.8 ft-lbs (I think its probably a bit less with hunting weight pellets, but I can't prove it since I don't have a chronograph). However I'm not fond of the 880. Its got a lot of plastic in it including the receiver and I haven't been that impressed with the quality of mine. In fact I've been a bit miffed at the quality since I've had problems with the bolt occasionally blowing back/open during firing unless I get the bolt closed perfectly and at times the cocking lever flexes when you reach the 10th pump. Still for a $35 gun, you could do worse.<br>  <br>  The Crosman 660 in my opinion is a far better gun than the Daisy 880. Its still got a lot of plastic, but the bolt is better designed (once its closed and you pull the trigger, it isn't going to open unless you open it) and mine lasted about 7 years with less than recommended maintenance before the seals finally gave out (I'd probably still be shooting it if I'd oiled it every 250 shots like Crosman recommends). Like the Daisy 880 its reasonably accurate at reasonable ranges and will turn out around 645 fps for a nominal muzzle energy of 7.4 ft-lbs. For around $40-$50 you're getting your money's worth.<br>  <br>  The Crosman 2100 is probably going to be the next airgun I buy, if/when my finances improve. Its got a metal receiver, though the stock is still plastic. Its a bit bigger and heavier than the Crosman 660. And everything I've been able to find on it says its a pretty good gun. Add in the fact that Crosman claims a nominal muzzle velocity of 725 fps for a muzzle energy of 9.3 ft-lbs... Its definitely worth considering for a small game hunting airgun in the $60-$75 range ($60 for the Crosman branded gun. $75 for the Remington branded gun. Its the same gun, you figure out which one you'd rather buy...)<br>  <br>  The Benjamin 397 is the Cadillac of .177 pump airguns. Its got a muzzle velocity of 800 fps for 11.4 ft-lbs of energy. Its got a wooden stock, steel receiver, and brass barrel. I don't know anyone on YA! who has a bad thing to say about it. (And the reviews at Pyramid Air are all 4/5 and 5/5s.) (The only possible downside I can see is you can't shoot steel BBs through it without running the risk of damaging the rifling. Then again why would you want to since pellets are a lot more accurate.) That said I don't have one. I haven't shot one. Still it seems like this is the gun to beat. The only downside is that quality and power doesn't come cheap. It costs around $160 at Pyramid Air (though you might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere).<br>  <br>  So which one... As you can probably guess, I'd recommend avoiding the Daisy 880. The Crosman 660 while not a bad gun, is marginal for hunting squirrels and pigeons beyond about 20-25 yards. Still its a good target/plinking gun. So that leaves the Crosman 2100 and the Benjamin 397. If you've got the money, the 397 is the better gun. If you're a bit short of money, the 2100 is solid and good enough to hunt with.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	JKirsch hit it on the button. only downside on the benjamin is mounting a scope, but very good guns if you can afford it.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	"J Kirsh" gave you a very impressive answer. The only thing I have to add is that you can buy the Benjamin 397 for $129 at Cobra Air<br>  <a href="http://www.airgunsbbguns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.airgunsbbguns.com</a><br>  <br>  I agree with "Ben" IMO, the 397 is best served by a Williams peep sight...

0Dm3WEMcaa	It does hurt but the way a wrestler lands and the way the move is done limits the pain. The ring is just like a boxing ring, its wood a bit of padding and a canvas top. The landing is normally shoulder backside and feet landing at the same time to spread out the impact and the moves are done with control, the slam them hard enough to make it look like a slam but not as hard as they can. Most important thing is wrestlers are pretty tough, MVP did an interview here in england and said a study showed a slam in a ring is like being hit by a car doing 20mph so it is a fair impact but they just get on with it.|`|AA11105507	They know how to fall and land properly.

But the reason for that is that he had a group of useless players when he arrived, and so every season he's having to bring in players in numerous positions, whereas Ferguson has been able to pick out just one or two targets a season and spend 20m + on each of them. Benitez has had to take risks and spread a similar amount of money out on a much larger amount of players. If United had to comprimise their budget they would make mistakes as well.|`|HxET88bDaa	That's totally irrelevant.....want to know why? Because since the premiership has begun you guys have bought numerous useless players who have done crap and you have shipped out again, most your fans would admit this too. When it comes to United we have bought class players, yes a few haven't done well, but most of our big buys have done well and continue to do well and so they stay with us. So, our squad has high investment because we have bought good players who are hard to get, teams know Utd have money and they will play games with us to get a higher price (Spurs- Berbatov, Carrick/ Bayern Munich- Hargreaves/ Kia Gorabwhatshisname- Tevez etc/ Leeds- Rio/ Everton- Rooney) Notice the players who have left us, Fergie only sold them because he wanted them out, not because they were crap. The few exceptions being Veron, Kleberson etc. If you list the whole transfer amounts coming in and out it would be a different story...<br>  <br>  TP: Yeah i suppose you're right in part and i respect that opinion. It's all down to budget, i just don't understand how we get slack for it when we simply support them and only a select few have access to the finances! lmao

Um59i2H1aa	i'm celebrating w/ you. and i hope he breaks those records.<br>  <br>  however, i'm not sure how a 4-0 shutout is better than just "any" shutout, w/ respect to Brodeur's performance. if you're talking about Brodeur... yes, he did a great job by coming back and being spot on.<br>  <br>  if you're talking about the team, then THEY have been doing a great job turning lemons into lemonade. and yes, THEY gave Brodeur a great pad w/ 4 goals. but it is true that most people didn't think they'd be doing THIS well after #30 was out. credit the coach, the captains, the players.<br>  <br>  not trying to take anything away from the game, the performances. but you're comment of ...<br>  <br>  "Pfft, and people say they were doing great because of Brodeur missing"<br>  <br>  ... is a little puzzling. almost sounds resentful. the devils were doing great not BECAUSE Brodeur was missing, but rather, in SPITE of Brodeur missing. and now there is a good chance that they will be even better, especially w/ an NHL icon goalie returning, w/ massive playoff experience... AND performance.|`|F934e4HQaa	He's AMAZING! He is 2nd all time in wins,shutouts and time on ice Marti is also 4th all time in shots against and saves.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	Yes wonder how he's going to do against a non last place team who's terrible on the road.<br>  <br>  Still a nice accomplishment.|`|G33E41IBaa	Haha yeah...I agree with Beerslayer.  A 4-0 shutout is the same as a 1-0 shutout for a goalie.  He would still gave to make the same number of saves regardless of how much his team scores.  Scoring 4 goals just looks nicer :)<br>  <br>  The Avs are a terrible team and they played really badly last night (though they did give me a scare in the last two minutes of the game with their onslaught of Brodeur).  But the Devils also played a complete game with both good defense and offense, and a shutout is a shutout.  That game capped the perfect return for Marty.  A win, shutout, and four goals scored by his team.  Only 5 shutouts and 7 games away from setting the record!<br>  <br>  How nice was Parise's goal??  He's killer on the backhand.|`|UoUaO52taa	Good for him but why is 4-0 so great. He didn't score or set anyone up|`|9vLzGwVqaa	He is amazing.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	thats really good|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	It felt real good, almost brought a tear to my eye hearing the crowd chant "MARTY" at the Rock.

I felt a tad bad when they dropped Clemmer to Lowell but I know that is just paving the way for a trade. Coming into this season ready to break the last of the leagues Goaltending records then Pooof!!! Out for almost 4 months. I was actually at the game we lost him at and I will be there again Sunday against the Flys.|`|Q8amh0rUaa	He came back versus one of the worst teams in the NHL.  He wasnt really tested so u cant tell if he is going to be the full Marty or not.  Being an avs fan, im not even kidding when i ssay they suck horribly.<br>  <br>  And im not just making excuses on why he got a shutout.  the avalanche really do suck bad this year.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Great for him...but what makes a 4-0 shutout anymore special than a 1-0 shutout??|`|wCblFbrmaa	In no way was he even tested all game so it really was not that big of a deal.|`|tW8fh4IGaa	Just more proof that he is the best goalie ever.|`|AA11457957	I have watched him since the day he became a Devil! He is a star!|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	I have much man love for Brodeur|`|YajYjjxLaa	please dont remind me about that game<br>  <br>  lol|`|ejjX7zgoaa	I would look at it the other way around...  A 1-0 shutout gets a much better look than a 4-0 shutout.  In 1-0, the goalie is pretty much the only difference in the game, plus the last 1-2 minutes of the game is 6 on 5 play if it's 1-0.  When it's 4-0 you can always see the players nearing the 4-5 minute mark not play as hard, because they know the odds of making 4 goals in 4 minutes is pretty outlandish.<br>  <br>  Brodeur is a beast.  Sure wish he played for someone other than the freakin' Devils though lol|`|ROWSzTknaa	I didn't see the game. So, I don't know if he REALLY earned that shutout or the guys playing out helped him a lot or the Avs just played like ****. But who cares? I agree with everybody else it counts as another shutout no matter the score or the circumstances. <br>  That's sweet though. 6 more to go I can't wait.|`|XyU7bGYOaa	i think that he played great, clemmenson was doing very well and people might of thought clemmenson was the man, i always thought brodeur was beast, he is one of the greatest.<br>  <br>  i feel that this isnt his only shut out this year... hes gonna have i say 5 shut outs.<br>  <br>  those are my thoughts.|`|suojKPfPaa	Pure amazement! The atmosphere in the arena last night was crazy! I'm so excited for Brodeur, and can't wait for the day when us Devils fans can actually say, 'Brodeur is the best goalie to ever step foot on the ice,' and not have someone trying to argue with us. Let's Go Devils!|`|uIrM0XM0aa	Martin Brodeur is an amazing goalie! thats it, not more explanation needed!<br>  <br>  GO DEVILS!|`|eTHEgWq0aa	Only plausible answer:<br>  <br>  Brodeur is a legend.|`|Ul9rMdseaa	Brodeur is a great goalie and I think it fits him to get shutout on his first game back.

CshFQShGaa	Manny's netting an extra $5 million in this deal, and it's going to take an extra 3 years get it. <br>  <br>  Had he kept his mouth shut in Boston, and honored the deal they had, he would have collected his 2 $20m extensions, and been paid in the 2 years he earned it, instead of the deferments that are in his Dodger contract. <br>  <br>  Instead, Scott Boras had to get involved, since he wasn't going to collect any commission on those $20m extension years (they were part of his original contract, which was drawn up by his former agent). He made sure those extension years were done away with when he went to LA last August, assuring himself of some income from Manny the next few years. I'm sure that was part of the plan when Manny hired him last February.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	I have yet to see a question posted about how much the Dodgers are making in total if they can afford to offer that type of money (and we all know they are in the business of being a business).  Or a question about what George's take-home pay is from the Yankees.  The ignorant perspective is to direct your anger (if that's what you feel) towards the players, hell they actually play the game we love to watch!  A better question is who is making the most at the top of it all...then, if you want to ask if they are "selfish" fine.  But a player who is a world champion and one of the top right handed hitters of all time has a going price that will be in line with contracts before him, minus the current economic conditions.  To be upset and have to relearn this with every single sports signing is like beating yourself in the head with your own hand.  Just ignorant.|`|BCebZRu3aa	Anyone who lays down and quits on plays the way he did with the Red Sox should be avoided the plague. I don't like him on a personal level because I saw several plays where he deliberately blew it. He ran slower than he could have, he dropped balls he should not have, and he generally phoned it in. He is very talented, but if he were a TRUE pro, he would have played hard despite his feelings about the Red Sox management.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Manny selfish? thats an understatement. <br>  <br>  Try the biggest Gong Show in the league. Plays when he wants to play. Give it about 3 months in LA and he'll want out.|`|AA10425091	not selfish...lucrative|`|YzROGXS1aa	I wish the Dodgers would tell Manny and Scott Boros to stick it.|`|ProDw5xAaa	He's worth it. He just wants to be paid what he's worth.|`|47KHWGALaa	He deserves more money.  He is a great of.  I say about 50 mill|`|AA10439008	Of course the Red Sox sell out every game anyway so they don't need Manny for that reason.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Considering he stands to make the Dodgers hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a season from ticket/vendor/concession sales, he's easily worth that much money. Not to mention the fact that he makes the Dodgers one of the best teams in the NL with his bat. While that kind of money seems like alot to a fan, players that pull that cash are worth it. He impacts the game far beyond the game itself. Red Sox fans might be happy with Jason Bay, but I guarantee you that they don't sell a single extra ticket with Bay on their team. People go to the stadium to watch Manny, not Bay.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	not selfish at all, this is a business when its all said and done.  the dogers would not have offered him such a large contract in only two years, it they didn't believe they would benefit (and make money) from having Manny on the team.  They sell more seats, win more games, sell more jerseys, hats, tshirts, etc with Manny on the team.  After his two year deal is up, i guarantee you the dogers will have made money off of having Manny on the team as opposed to losing money b/c they had to pay Manny $45 million over the two years.|`|61L9P2tQaa	first of all.. no one is worth that much money to begin with. unless u invented the wheel than u shouldnt make this much. Manny has been the best hitter hands down during the duration of his career. I think that he will end up taking this deal.. they said that both sides are getting close. but i actually think manny is purposely doing this to avoid as much of spring training as possible. i kno thats sounds crazy.. but he truly dislikes spring training. i think hes holden on till both sides just cant take it anymore.|`|gfGtx1m6aa	no,he deserves more but the way he acts stopped him from that,they should feel lucky they got him at that price.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Not selfish at all.  No one is forcing the Dodgers to pay it.
1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	It all depends on the fuel mileage they are getting and amount of tire wear at the different tracks.  Obviously the length of the track has a lot to do with the amount of laps they can run.  Usually the only mandatory pit stops occur when there are possible tire issues and they want to see how they are wearing.  You especially see this when there has been rain that has washed the rubber build up off of the surface of the track itself.  NASCAR usually throws a mandatory caution at 20 to 25 laps into the race to check on how the tires are doing under those circumstances.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	They don't have to pit ever.  But nascar has stringent rules on the size of the gas tank.  So you're not going but so far before needing a fill up.  While some teams do get better gas mileage than others, all the cars pretty much run dry at the same time.  The only mandatory pit stop would be for a penalty.  Nascar can also park you for being too slow or other various reasons.|`|icTRTBAraa	that right there is the pit strategy.  When to pit and when not to pit?  Can they make it to the end without pitting and keeping field advantage or will they run out of gas?  That is an age old question.  But to help they have reduced the size of the fuel cells through the years so they have to pit more often because they don't carry as much fuel for safety reasons.|`|yVwkHIXDaa	Pit stops are usually based on how long the tires will last or how many laps the fuel will last. It varies by track.|`|H7hHCHRkaa	Don't even know what a nascar driver is here deep down at the bottom of the globe!!! LOL|`|PJhwWVcMaa	You can pretty much pit whenever you want but you usually aren't going to want to pit unless you need tires or fuel or have a serious problem with your car. At a large track like Talladega or Daytona you might have to pit after about 35 or 40 laps. At a small track like Bristol you could go around 140 laps before pitting. There are some factors that can slightly influence that pit window too, such as tires.|`|AA11202769	No NASCAR does not mandate pit stops, usually. They only do this when they feel the track is unsafe to go beyond a certain number of laps. This usually happens after it rains very heavily the night before a race and the tack loses it's grip so the track is slicker. Otherwise, it depends on many things as to how many laps including track size, speeds, caution laps, how efficient the driver and car is, etc.|`|TJqsKB6uaa	It depends on many factors.<br>  1.Fuel some tracks you can go long distances and not pit for a long time and others you can only go a few laps<br>  2. Tires in some races tires will go before the fuel and they need to pit to get new tires<br>  3.Weather if it rains the night before the race NASCAR will have a mandatory pit stop to check tire wear|`|ZC3bWRPnaa	it depends on the track<br>  <br>  you think a guy can go 80 laps at Bristol and 80 laps at Daytona on 1 tank? <br>  <br>  I think nottttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt|`|tGHGloS1aa	it depends on what track you are on because some are only half mile track and some are 2 and a half miles|`|9vcZjFl6aa	too many vairables also ask carl edwards he seems to be pretty good at saving fuel|`|gr6e1WZEaa	In practice they run enough laps to determine fuel mileage and tire wear. It gives them a good idea as to how long they can go untill they have to pit. Notes from the last races at that track also helps determine this, but race conditions and weather conditions come into play and tireware and fuel mileage can be better checked on the first pit stop.

UHXNA1Imaa	For me its Torquay Utd & Weymouth.

AA10654659	DO NOT i mean DO NOT grab C or RP in the first 5 rounds at least. they dont produce as well as other position players. depending on your scoring system. their are alot of 1B out there so you could wait a little. Mornueau should be avail about the 5th round. you should try for a SS ramirez, reyes or rollings. or OUT first. OUT's give you lots of points. then about the 6th round start loading up on SPs|`|SkYLrMy7aa	depends where you're picking in the draft, while theres an abundance of solid 1b its stupid to pass on Albert Pujols.  Keep in mind alot of those 2b are good for stolen bases.  Likewise on pitchers, theres always good picks in the later rounds but you win with your strikeout machines and good closers|`|xQFWjFyZaa	Catchers do not win fantasy baseball leagues. Most people wait as long as possible for a catcher, because most of them produce minimal stats to begin with. Start with positions like 3rd, SS, 2nd, OF. I usually wait til round 5-6 for Starting pitchers.<br>  <br>  I think it's best to follow Yahoo's rankings in your first year. After you get some experience, you will realize which positions should be taken early, and which can be found later.

Usually all drag racing or rock crawling. I'm sorry, but I'm sick of drag racing TV shows and building shows.  <br>  <br>  The Disciplines should include: Rally cars, Score, Sprint Boats, a special race car like Baja, Pikes Peak Unlimited, maybe a formula car or Vintage racer, Sweedish sidecar, drag bike, solar cars, GT racers, Lemons, Pan Americana.  Just to name a few. <br>  <br>  Sorry man, not to knock on your idea but I think the concept is great.<br>  <br>  *I know top-gear and this is why it's a kick *** show.

At the end of the day,without Buffalo's injury situation they don't get that much for him.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	A 4th round pick for a career backup goalie with a career 3.04 GAA and a Save% of .897. Sounds fair to me.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	no|`|UzhfaJH2aa	Telly is OK. He seemed to make all the routine stops while here in Toronto. Not going to do anything outstanding but a good pickup for a fourth round pick. Probably not going to be the difference in a playoff run for the Sabres, won't cost you any games but won't steal any either.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I thought Weeks or Clemmer was going there|`|VC5mEULTaa	I wouldn't expect much more than a 4th Rd. pick for a backup goaltender. Marty Biron got an early 2nd, but he could have been a starting goaltender. Should be interesting to see how much he plays, and is it an indication that Miller will be out a long time?<br>  <br>  looks like Olli was just traded too.|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Obviously not.
yikZNA7aaa	it doesn't matter, he's always been in the mdia more than most other NFL players. He's like Tony Romo, but better. He probably should focus more on football, but the media makes what they want out of it. Until he proves otherwise on the field, he's still one of tht op 2 QB's in the game, so I guess we should give him the benefit of the doubt.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	no, he is hurt. he is in rehab.

cR7Sf4cjaa	There is nothing more useless than an empty pistol.  <br>  <br>  People who carry concealed always carry a loaded pistol.<br>  <br>  With the except of older single action models - all modern revolvers will have the cylinders full.<br>  <br>  With semi-auto pistols there is a grey area.  You can carry the pistol with a full magazine and one in the chamber - or - carry with just a full mag and none in the chamber.  <br>  <br>  1911 auto's and models with an exposed hammer are almost never carried with one in the chamber - if the pistol is dropped on the exposed hammer it will discharge.<br>  <br>  Many modern pistols - Glock, Sig, Springfield Armory XD etc have an internal hammer specifically designed not to release when dropped.  These semi-auto are normally carried with one in the chamber - and - these models usually offer a 'loaded chamber indicator' to warn you there is one in chamber.<br>  <br>  To carry one in the chamber or not is personal choice - all depends on your experience, training, and how you store the firearm.  If you have to clear the gun at the end of the day (remove the chambered cartridge) then having one in the chamber is not the way to go - most accidental discharges and home shooting accidents happen when clearing a pistol.  <br>  <br>  The best solution is the firearm remains in the high quality holster fully loaded and goes into the safe - never leaving the holster.  You put it on and wear it, then put it back, and never remove it from the holster. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	what good would an unloaded carry gun be?  you'd be better off carrying a rock than an unloaded $500 pistol - they'd effectively be the same thing.<br>  <br>  if you're asking can you have a round chambered, i would assume that you could, though i would not recommend it.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Once you have a Permit to carry in PA you can carry a concealed loaded  weapon.

No classes required, not even a photo required, that one is added by some county Sheriffs. Most modern firearms, semi-auto or revolver, have passive hammer blocks and will not fire unless the trigger is depressed. Even older models of the Colt .45 Government without blocks are extremely unlikely to fire even if dropped (though dropping is not advisable).|`|OYy1OmDPaa	No dumb questions, just dumb people.<br>  <br>  Everyone has personal limits defined by mental and physical abilities.<br>  <br>  Please do not purchase, possess, or carry any firearm.

The Roid thing with A-rod was/is bad but Manny is just a bum!|`|AL6O8glFaa	They were both bad obviously but manny for sure he just spitt in the temas face!!|`|19YfKNpJaa	I think most of us Red Sox fans have moved on.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	Are you serious, its A-rod bringing shame to the game!!!!|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Well what A-Rod did helped the team more so from that perspective what Manny did was worse.|`|ouXbJLbOaa	well what manny did, in some ways was ok because baseball is there job, and if you can get more money for your job, youd swich and get it to. just like if your working at mcdonalds, and burger king offers you more money. youd probably switch. it wasnt ok in someways because, he shouldve stayed loyal to his team.|`|oMYGtqubaa	A-ROD is worse.<br>  <br>  The Manny situation is definitely bad, but its something that could've been avoided... <br>  <br>  <br>  A-Rod just STRAIGHT UP CHEATED and BROKE the LAW.|`|nDzenpkwaa	Manny probably did both.  Quit on his team and take PED's...|`|SEcM9EDZaa	They're both scumbags.
r5V3ZNGfaa	What? Mario Lemieux would lose his live-in babysitter. So I don't think so. :b<br>  <br>  Just kidding. I really don't see Crosby getting moved though; this season, especially. In my opinion, it's only coincidence that the Pens are doing better without Crosby, because they've started really getting new coach Byslma's system down, Gonchar is in game shape and the powerplay looks SO much better, and perhaps right now it's also a matter of acquiring a player (Chris Kunitz) that has been hot since he started playing for the Pens. The Pens haven't wanted to trade Crosby for "missing pieces" (other way around actually) and I don't see them doing so in the immediate future. Byslma has said that when Crosby comes back, Kunitz will be playing on his line, so I'm assuming Crosby's really coming back. On a side note: I'm excited to see if Crosby can't get energetic Kunitz some goals, but at the same time, it's nice to finally see Staal looking more confident and chipping in offensively.<br>  <br>  All that being said... if Crosby didn't want to come back until the Pens lost a game and "needed" him, and it ended up that they never lost a game up until the end of the season, I wouldn't feel too bad about him not coming back. Haha, sorry Sid. At least that's not likely though.|`|CNKBGVgQaa	There is no possible way that Crosby will get traded. He is our franchise player and they would never ruin that. I believe that the only reason were winning now is not because he isnt playing, but because the rest of the team feels they have to step it up. For example, last season when he got hurt, Malkin took the lead. The players just have to play the same way when he comes back. Also, trading Gretsky had to be the stupidist thing Edmonton couldve done.|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	lol....good one j.o....|`|yIdwMPsoaa	i dont think anybody big will get traded in the pens before 3. but maybe this summer!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Edmonton dumped Gretzky because the LA Kings gave millions of cash as part of the deal (and Peter Pocklington needed money at the time).<br>  <br>  It wasn't done at the deadline; it was done over the summer.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	The injury of Crosby coincides with adding Kunitz, and the return of Gonchar, and the utterly necessary change of coaching, which are more likely the contributing factors to their sudden improvement. Crosby isn't going anywhere...<br>  <br>  I imagine if someone was traded, it would be the incorrect move and Malkin would go (Malkin contributes better to the Pens on the ice and is far less injury prone, but Crosby sells more tickets and merchandise).|`|WgTKHqlnaa	I think that Pittsburgh can't keep Crosby and Malkin forever. I can't see how one team can afford two guys that are that highly paid and not suffer in every other aspect of the game (I could see it if it were a forward and a defenseman taking up that much salary). <br>  <br>  However, I think if one of them was to ever get traded, it would be Malkin and not Crosby.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Funny, I was thinking of asking the same question....lol. <br>  <br>   I highly doubt that they will move him, at the deadline, but why not in the off season? They already have a decent team and have shown they can win without him, so why not get 2-3 "missing" pieces that this team needs? Crosby will get you that and it won't be chump change in return. I have nothing against the kid, but maybe he needs a new home.<br>  <br>   If he is the next coming of that Wayne guy you speak of, then why not trade him. All he'll have to do is score over 800 goals and he'll be spoken in the same breath and Bettman will be all giggly because he can say "I told you so.....neener neener neener"|`|6KZgeq3Maa	Crosby and Malkin both resigned on long term deals at severely discounted prices just to stay with the Pens.  I doubt either one of them will be moving in the forseeable future.  Would kind of be a major slap in the face to give a cap friendly discounted deal only to turn around an be traded less than a few years into the deal.

ZatADRPXaa	The tests and results are confidential.  The only way you hear about them is through a suspension (where all you know OFFICIALLY is that the player was suspended for violating the substance abuse policy) or a leak.
uzNm9KtYaa	In all probability, you were being visited (and entertained?) by a bobcat.  An even slighter possibility is that your visitor was a cougar.  Either of these two wildcats are known for screaming calls that often give people the impression they are hearing a woman in extreme distress.  Deer also make bleating and mewing sounds but I doubt that was what you heard reverberating through the night woods.  However, a third possibility, and one that is perhaps even more likely, is that you heard the dying cries of a rabbit after it had been captured by any number of critters intent on making it their supper.  The screaming of a rabbit will put the hairs up on the back of your neck for sure, no matter how many times you've heard it happen.  To be sure, take a walk in the woods near where you heard the calls coming from.  Tracks in the snow will tell you the story of what was going on and why.  And just to be on the safe side, take that walk in broad daylight just in case it was a cougar, and a hungry one at that.  ;o)  Good luck.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	First link below is a list of recording that play the different sounds deer make. <br>  <br>  A 'monkey' sound can come from birds, but most likely that was a rabbit.

If you were to go to the country side of Japan training in Karate everyday of your life, trust me, with the mountains there, it's going to be, will always be, and most definitely going to be intense.<br>  <br>  Tai-Chi can be just as intense. Not much younger people can do it because it requires a lot of patience. To say what is the most intense is nothing more than a biased statement.

But when it comes to hurting afterwords and maybe paying a visit to the E.R., there's no question that Ninjutsu is intense.<br>  <br>  Intense training does not make a martial art good.

XLXncQu9aa	Part of the issue here is production in the offense.  The Giants didn't do so well down the stretch when he wasn't in the offense.  Without him their offense was reduced in productivity.  Secondly, I do believe he will serve time as well.  I don't think he will serve more than 2-5 years in prison for this.  But I think he shouldn't be allowed to play until he gets the proper punishment from Goddell.  The last thing you want is to have another Pacman situation.  Burress is a great player but the rules should stand anyway.|`|jn7hxEA7aa	If i were Roger i wouldnt let him back because of his legal trouble and if i were the giants i wouldnt want him back because thats opening the door to drama.|`|AA12103453	Unless he makes a plea he IS serving big jail time, it's a mandatory minimum of like 3 years for the current charges(and THAT'S jail time not probation). Anyway NO they can't condemn him and beg him to come back. They either say he was wrong, or they beg him to come back. They can do like they've done so far. They can say they will welcome him back when the problem is resolved, but they can't step in and say they want him back and hope he doesn't go to jail.|`|43f9Ctozaa	If New York goes by their laws he show go to jail for a year because the gun was unregistered. If the Giants want to continue to be the discipline team that they want to they can't bring him back because the gun was just the cherry on top. He was missing meeting, skipping practise and still dong little stupid things that showed lack of respect.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yes,if he can clear up his legal problems and be quiet and just show  his stuff on field i think the fans and the giants organisation will have him back no problem.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	I'm still confused as to why everyone just assumes Burress won't be spending time in jail (like all of next season at least...I am under the impression it's a mandatory jail sentence if convicted).  After all, there's an absolute boatload of evidence to prove he broke the law.<br>  <br>  If he does somehow skate, all the Giants have to tell Burress is that they need him to be sucessful as a team but that they won't tolerate any more incidents off the field or missing practices etc.  If he does get in trouble again, that's when they're really going to have trouble dealing with Plax since they're essentially backing down if they let him come back after this latest incident.  They'll probably be forced to trade or cut Plax if he screws up again (provided he ever gets the chance and his career isn't ended by sitting in jail, which I still think is a lot more likely than most people want to believe).|`|BlgZmV6uaa	He is in some very seious legal trouble the laws in New York are very hard on guys that carry handguns.So I think that all has to be settled before anything can be said.Maybe making part of his comeing back to speak to kids about responsiblity and bad decisions where it could lead part of his contract.|`|VQyTspNraa	What do you mean "beg" Plax to come back?  Last I checked he was making a ton of money from the Giants for doing nothing.  He should beg not to get sued by the team to recover his salary.

EGe0k8P6aa	Given that some .22 caliber pellet guns (like the Daystate Ranger, Evanix AR6, Airforce Condor, etc... generate 50-80 ft-lbs) and there are .25, 9mm, .45, and .50 caliber airguns that generate even more (80-500+ ft-lbs) I don't see any reason that a .22 caliber (or larger) air-rifle couldn't kill a goose (much less a pheasant) from a power perspective.

Maybe in the future it will tell you if you are breaking  the law.<br>  As a survival weapon for small game an air rifle capable of firing the .22 cal pellets might be a choice for conjecture when one considers the simplicity of the ammunition and the amount of reserve "ammo" one could store or transport.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	Yes depending on the power of the air rifle, range, and shot placement.

They are running gears that require the engine to stay at a higher than usual RPM and staying at a high RPM around the track. They will get it figured out or at least I hope so.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	A few years ago it was 9000 RPM's was the highest you wanted to go. Now they are saying 9200. The engines are still basically the same as they were a few years ago.  It is amazing that any car can average that many RPM's and not blow up. I am amazed that anyone finishes these races. At Atlanta it will probably be worse as this track does not require much braking. I am sure some teams are trying to get the most out of the engines that they can and that is causing some of these issues.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	My favorite blew up almost before the race began.  Attrition has become less of an issue in the races over the past few years.  So we were due.  I think it's hard to gain to gain an advantage with the car and thats why we're seeing engine and pit road issues.  Everyone is trying to get leg up on the competition and that leads to problems.  Sometimes you have to step over the edge to realize an edge exists.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	Sounds to me like there was a manufacturing defect. Or someone trying to "push the envelope" a little too hard.<br>  <br>  This week, I think we are going to see more weather problems.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	This week... It's going to be hit and miss weather again and probably a lot of HMS cars @ the front.<br>  <br>  Last week was bad for a lot of guys, let's hope they rebound this week. Especially Martin.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	it seems to be between the parts and pushiing for too much, not clear rally which one they will decide on. Should not ave that issue this week tho|`|c16PCaCmaa	If you want to believe Jeff Hammond and Darrell Waltrip, some of those teams are "experimenting" to see what they can get away with.  Since it is early in the season, they can fix their point deficit with the rest of the season.  The simplest way to look at it is the more power the engine has, the less reliable it is.  They are looking for that balance between the most power, and an engine that will be reliable for 500 miles.  I imagine that those teams have learned a lot, and their engineers are working to fix the problems.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	Last week Toyota had terrible problems, the lubricants in their motors was too heavy from what I read.  They said they fixed the problem now.  I think about everybody will be tuned in this week, kinda like waking up in the morning, takes Ya a little while to get going.  Should be exciting this week, everybody is hungry for a win.|`|yVwkHIXDaa	Strange first three weeks.....<br>  Las Vegas: After watching the Nationwide on Saturday I was afraid we'd be in for more of the same on Sunday and we were. Not sure about all the talk about over rev-ing above 9200rpms but when the cameras would focus on the Fords it was apparent the drivers were paying attention to the "stay under 9200". <br>  Maybe we are seeing the results of no testing in the off season?|`|cMLJPQpBaa	Tires... Tires, and mo Tires!!
AA11528760	Cena will be definitely added to the Big Show v/s Edge match, that's because it's a Edge-Cena fued. However, the reason they are adding Big Show to the mix is to give the feud some life, since Edge v/s Cena has been done so many times before. It also hints at a post-Mania fued between Show & Edge, with Vickie turning on Edge or vice-versa. IMO, the final picture at Mania would be the biggest face of the company - John Cena - standing tall as the new World champ. <br>  <br>  Incase things turn out to be different from what's my prediction, then Cena v/s Hogan could also be a good one, with the match being the last match ever for the Hulkster. Also, a brief Heel-turn for Cena in this match could be interesting.<br>  <br>  BQ: The WWE might consider releasing Umaga if he can't give his best in the ring, after all these injuries.|`|MNIUhMajaa	its ok.. its better than having someone like cm punk who comes out and panders to those hypocrites each and every night!|`|YRRXtVXeaa	VERY!!! DUMB MOVE!!|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	Yep it is a very bad idea...|`|AA10043476	The Big Show should be one of the very top contenders year round. The guy is a giant and should be billed as such. Look at Andre the Giant for expample. He was unstoppable. The Big Show should be used like Andre. BUT! Vince has already destroyed the character of the Big Show and made him look like a average joe who just happens to be over 7 ft tall. <br>  <br>  In WCW he was build as a extremely hard to beat Giant. That is why When Goldberg beat the Giant is was a big deal and the fans went crazy. Just like Hogan beating Andre.|`|Jd04Z1ISaa	There nothing good about the Big Show main eventing any WrestleMania, he wouldnt have even main evented WrestleMania 24 if it wasn't for Floyd Mayweather.<br>  <br>  I don't even think he should be on the WrestleMania card the guy is horrible.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	Well, it's better than Vladimir "Can't Sell Moves, and Botches A Lot" Kozlov<br>  <br>  The guy sandbagged taker, has a crap finisher, can't sell, his timing is god awful, is a stiff inside the ring|`|TAPBWPJLaa	No.<br>  <br>  And personally, I don't see that match staying Edge vs. Big Show for long. I'm expecting John Cena to jump into the fray.<br>  <br>  BQ: If he doesn't recover quickly, he will be released. Either that, or he should return with a different and more acceptable gimmick.<br>  <br>  TheBooth- I completely agree with you. The Big Show should be a top contender all the time, and he shouldn't be a joke character in any sense. Look how great he was at ECW Champion and as a monster in WCW.|`|KwQlQJZ3aa	Why do people analyze the WWE as nothing but storylines and move botches?   CAn't you people just enjoy the show for what it is?  Stop trying to use your intellect to decipher the psychology behind everything.  Its not working.  Leave that to us pros, k?<br>  <br>  Big Show = Andre the Giant.<br>  'nuff said.<br>  Try using your little psychology experiment to decipher -that- comment kids.|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	It doesn't sound like you understand the pro wrestling business very well. What WWE has done here is have the baddie GM and wife of the champ, Vickie Guerrero, make a match which looks like it's a shoo-in for Edge to retain the title, thus enraging both John Cena fans and Edge detractors alike. This was done on purpose in order to get people like you angry, and it has worked! :)<br>  <br>  You will find it is a swerve and that your feelings of elation at the decision being changed to include Cena will be all the more great. And that's how storylines work best.<br>  <br>  ----------------------------------<br>  EDIT: Big Show isn't going to be 'carrying' the SD main event then, as you put it. If Cena is in the mix, it will be Cena and Edge that 'carry' it as Big Show, despite his size, is simply nowhere near them in terms of charisma or popularity. Don't worry about the main event :)<br>  ----------------------------------<br>  <br>  If anyone faces Hogan, it'll surely be Jericho for all the things he's done to the Hall Of Famers.<br>  <br>  BQ: It's a shame for Umaga, but he will be back and not released.|`|zmDopvd4aa	1st Q: Everything will turn alright don't worry. Big Show will probably be fighting somebody like JBL or something and the main event will be Edge Vs Cena and despite if Edge wins or not he will probably face Big Show at Backlash. Big Show isn't good enough and never will be for a Wrestlemania main event so I agree with you in that respect<br>  <br>  2nd Q: Apart from Cena Vs Edge I wouldn't mind seeing Cena Vs Rey Mysterio<br>  <br>  BQ: I think he may be released soon which is a shame but in his career afterwards I think he will go to TNA and team with Samoa Joe and make a TNA version of the Wild Samoans

CdAE4nXcaa	if you are looking for just a self defense like being attacked or mugged i would suggest krav maga  it's used by the Israeli special forces and many of our own military now. it is a martial art that involves, techniques from many different styles, jiu jitsu, muay thai, karate, judo ect. and it takes the techniques that work not the flashy high kicks, or jumping flying back kick or whatever. it trains to defuse the encounter effectively and fast.  against knives, guns, bats, multiple attackers. ect.|`|pLsQdLl3aa	Lycann's got it right on the nose. You are going to get a bunch of opinions on which art you should take. Some are going to be biased to the art they take, most will be biased to the art they hear most said by announcers while watching UFC. (all the thumbs down came from them lol) <br>  <br>  Before you try to pick a style you might wanna know what's in your area. You don't wanna get your heart set on Judo and then find out the nearest dojo is 75 miles away. So first thing first, grab a phone book. Next go check out the school and teacher, see if it's legit. If it looks legit try it out before you sign up. Wanna know how you can tell if it's legit, search the question, there are plenty of good responses from top members, or drop one of us an email after you check it out. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|hlqj0pvxaa	It depends on who is teaching in your city. <br>  <br>  100 kids in here will tell you "muay Thai!", Krav Maga!", Brazilian Jujutsu!!". <br>  <br>  There are a few Practitioners on here with a few decades of martial arts experience, knowledge and training.

I'd concentrate on just one of them and do as much damage to that one person, as I could....|`|4d13f34c6f100ed6121b3208fd700099aa	firstly. get rid of the focus on busting an arm. self-defence shouldnt be about causing too much harm.<br>  <br>  better to pin the attacker if its a single attacker and have someone call the police. saves on law-suits.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	First thing you have to understand is that most experienced martial artists will tell you your chances of winning drop drastically with each additional opponent. You can always train hard with multiple attackers to improve but the fact is you'd be in real trouble in the street.<br>  <br>  Next fact they will tell you is that grappling for a knife or gun almost always gets you cut or shot. The training reduces the likelihood that it will be fatal but it can't eliminate that chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  One more thing you might want to consider is that grappling multiple opponents isn't going work. Ground fighting armed opponents is equally dangerous.<br>  <br>  Most styles should prepare you for self defense. Look for the schools in your area and pay them a visit. Watch some classes and take part whenever you can without committing. Find the school with the best teacher because you will learn a lot more from a great teacher in any style than a mediocre to poor teacher in a hyped style. Sign up and train hard. Good luck.

xTPploEcaa	No, this will not doom the Mets.  He might miss his first 2 or 3 starts but in light of that he may still have a 18 game winning season.|`|WUc9TbHCaa	He is not injured. He is coming back from shoulder surgery and working back into form.|`|xRQfCdKOaa	Yes, Santana was over paid. He is a super star, but he is a pitcher. Pitchers are more likely to develop shoulder, elbow, ligament problems. I think he is going to have a tough year. Santana always starts out slow and kicks butt around August. This year I'm afraid it will be too late when he is finally ready to pitch "Santana style".
r5Lqi2cMaa	I agree with Wayne. Stay away from the Indian crickets. Anything that your Gecko digests from India increases it's chances of contracting mad cow disease by ten fold. And yes, I'm well aware that traditionally Gecko's can not contract mad cow disease. But India is so slum ridden that the disease has mutated to the point where it specifically targets Gecko's. If only it would mutate so it specifically targets Indian people...|`|Fom2temAaa	I was going to say indian crickets, but on second thoughts your gecko will probably get a healthy dose of cholera if you fed it indian crickets.<br>  <br>  Better to stick with the crickets from a first world country with more stringent food hygiene standards.<br>  <br>  Wrong section btw...................|`|jb8RpJBIaa	Jacob Oram and Andrew Symonds proberby have the most meat on them.|`|AA0L7X2Oaa	not to feeds but to plays<br>  <br>  mr gecko to throws his balls u hit with bat<br>  <br>  is geckoji name of ur childs<br>  <br>  wat type land u comes from|`|AA11088802	what|`|8yMkjeDdaa	what type of condom should i use
FPJSoxYwaa	It's starting to look more and more like they will be using it. I just skimmed through an article about Heikki saying positive things about KERS and that they are likely to be using it in Australia.|`|iK9UCuS3aa	I think Lewis has a good chance of winning again this year.<br>  I've read a few articles and l'd say they will run them in Melbourne. I found this article from Heikki that was published on March 4.<br>  <a href="http://f1.uk.reuters.com/f1/news/India-383383-1.php" rel="nofollow">http://f1.uk.reuters.com/f1/news/India-3...</a><br>  He says that they are 99% sure they will run them in Melbourne.|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	I think they might, even if it's only with one car in practice to gauge what the difference, if any, there is in performance. Then they should make a judgement for the race. It looks as though most teams won't be using it, so it could work out as a good choice.<br>  <br>  If I was in charge at McLaren (heaven forbid!!) then I'd make the call to use it in this way, but you just don't know what they're going to do... They're the experts after all....|`|pLoCn8dWaa	They haven't confirmed either way yet i don't think.<br>  <br>  I know that Force India definitely won't be running it though, and Ferrari weren't sure whether it would be worth it.<br>  <br>  Also, I think that Lewis will be under much less pressure with one championship under his belt, but the first race will show which team has the best car.|`|AA11469249	McLaren will play the game. Ferrari will do what they usually do. The rest - who knows - it will be decided on Monday before race day I expect.|`|hfQnUqnVaa	More than likely they say they have the car sorted if they choose to use it|`|pCS0d1axaa	Though the top teams say they will not run it at the first race. I think almost all the top teams will have a Ker's system in place and will run it if they feel that the competition has an edge.<br>  Hamilton was lucky last time but that cant take the fact that he deserved it. Saying that it is never easy to predict anything in F1. At his current team the odds are in his favor for winning at least one more championship if not many. Whether he actually wins one only time will tell.|`|zjzq6VS3aa	Mc laren are ready with there KERS so they will definetly go for it ....and speaking about  hamilton he will deinetly have huge competition this time!!

z4Yeofq8aa	It depends on your level of expertise and whether you have sufficient spare time and money to invest in parts. I spend a lot of time working on my bikes and customising them to my own specifications. To me however it's a hobby that I enjoy but it is a lot less expensive to buy a ready made bike.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	if you are talking expensive hand made custom frames, which are all basically built by hand anyway, maybe<br>  <br>  for instance, say you had an expensive component group<br>  you want a new frame<br>  and you want to move the components over<br>  <br>  it would be cheaper to do that yourself<br>  than to order the frame, send the components<br>  [or send the whole bike with the old parts, then ship 2 bikes back]<br>  <br>  but if you are talking cheaper stuff, all made in china or by a bike factory, they get discounts on components that you could never get<br>  <br>  with the discounts, adding the labor may make it still come out cheaper<br>  <br>  wle|`|vdsvcEsgaa	I wouldn't suggest it, bikes are definitely cheaper if you can get a nice one stock, and only change one or two things on it. Calculate how much this new bike will cost in parts, then find a bike similar to is and look at the price difference. If it seems worth it to build one up then go for it.|`|z1Ury9XNaa	To build a hybrid bike? No, it's not worth the money. Also I doubt you could buy just a hybrid frame.|`|68opYVLcaa	if ur talking about a bmx bike, if ur just starting no dont build one yourself unless u have freinds that will help you that already have been down this road,i built my first bike about 2 years after i started  really getting into bmx, the reason im telling you not to is becouse if your just starting, you dont know what kind of riding your going to like doin, you dont no if u like big bars, tiny bars, how u like ur cranks, what size tires you like running, your gear ratio its all justt a hastle so wait until you know what you like to build one, and if u already do no that, then yes go for it best investment you will ever make if you stick with it.|`|CaK0Bw9Jaa	yes and no<br>  yes because it shows youre a good craftsman and good with your hands<br>  no because it could fall apart and you could get seriously hurt|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Only if you are very particular about components, and just want the satisfaction that comes from doing it yourself. You'd be surprised at how complicated it can be, matching up components and installing them just right.<br>  <br>  You can minimize the cost by buying all the components at garage sales and flea markets if you know what you're doing. Buying new can be very expensive, relative to just buying the assembled bike.<br>  <br>  Might be best to find a sort of trashed out hybrid, and slowly taking it apart, one component at at time. Cross one hurdle and then go to the next one.<br>  <br>  You'd certainly get an education that could serve you well.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It's always cheaper to buy what you want already put together. The manufacturer gets a bigger discount on the huge amount of parts they buy.
AA10099706	To get a useful answer you need to be a little more specific with you question.  Basically, when you SCUBA dive you carry a tank of compressed air under water and you breath from that.  To do it requires that you take specific training in order to be able to do it safely.  In the class you will be able to get all of you questions answered.
UkW9FPEZaa	Well, I was surprised that most teams decided to stick with their goal tending tandems and the biggest goal tender traded was Pascal Leclaire to Ottawa but only one other goalie was actually traded of which was Olaf Kolzig to Toronto, who also picked up Martin Gerber(via re-entry waivers). That is basically all the goal tending trades that went down on the dead-line.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	I'm not sure about trading, but Gerber deserved far better than being sent down to the AHL.|`|QSShHlRiaa	Manny Fernandez<br>  But i have heard big rumors of<br>  the huge goalie Roberto Luongo Being traded<br>  if those rumors are true i would say <br>  Roberto Luongo Best goalie to be traded.|`|bxibWXnsaa	I dont think any noteworthy goalies are going to be moved due to the cap<br>  <br>  If any big name goalie will be moved I think it will be Nikoli Khabibulin since since the season began the Blackhawks have been talking about shopping him since they also have Huet|`|YRRXtVXeaa	CHRIS OSGOOD
wxXguyK3aa	I agree with you.  He is an amazing player.  He'll fit right in in the NFL.  His college career was amazing, and he only played for two years!|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Maclin is the best.<br>  <br>  favorites:<br>  <br>  1. Iglesias<br>  2. Maclin<br>  3. Crabtree<br>  <br>  TE- Pettigrew|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Derrick Williams from Penn St is my favorite.<br>  Crabtree is very good though but you asked who MY favorite was.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Maclin and Crabtree|`|kWL0WDRnaa	Percy Harvin.|`|4cUwYzqgaa	You have to go with Crabtree, he's just so exciting, you can give him the ball and you have no idea what is going to happen next, it doesn't happen often that you find someone like that at WR who just is so fun to watch, I can't say he has a sure fire great future in the NFL...but I'm really anticipating seeing him there.<br>  <br>  Another one to watch is Travis Beckum, he'll probably play Tight End in the pros, but he is one with a bright future as well...|`|UxooffHZaa	Crabtree isn't the fastest, but he's still the best out of this year. I think he'll be a good posession receiver in this league for 10 years. But, WRs don't often pan out. For every Santonio Holmes, (1st Round Steeler Pick 2006) there's 10 Troy Edwardses. (1st Round Steeler Pick 1999)

Nobody plays hard during the pre-season thats why none of the players like playing the pre-season.  Pirates are a sub-par MLB team.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Nope, sorry.  Bad teams usually have good records in Spring Training because they have young guys playing hard to make the team, while their opponents sit the stars by the 5th inning.<br>  <br>  Once the regular season rolls around, the opponents will be putting their stars on the field for all nine innings (or more), and the Pirates will be completely outmatched.|`|PRx6j6YQaa	preseason means nothing

What I suggest instead of climbing the 3 highest 8000ers is to climb the seven summits (Highest mountain of each continent).<br>  <br>  This is a much more exciting adventure and is gratifying on completion. <br>  <br>  These mountains include:<br>                  (Height)<br>  Everest   8848metres             Nepal/Tibet<br>  Aconcagua 6962metres              Argentina, South America<br>  Mount McKinley 6195metres    Alaska, North America<br>  Kilimanjaro 5963metres                Tanzania, Africa<br>  Elbrus  5633metres                   Russia, Europe<br>  Vinson Massif 4897metres      Ellsworth Range, Antarctica<br>  Mount Kosciuszko 2228 metres Australia <br>  <a href="http://www.everestnews.com/seven.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.everestnews.com/seven.htm</a><br>  <br>  If your boyfriend is serious about this goal, I really suggest he gets some mountaineering experience on smaller mountains such as Cho Oyu (6th highest mountain) and not an exceedingly technical climb. and perhaps a mountain such as Ama Dablam which is rather technical and stands in the 6000 metre range.<br>  <br>  I hope you understand the risks of mountaineering, as it can be quite dangerous.

AA11629848	Overconfidence of the US Olympic Team!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AiEGi0Zqaa	This may sound crazy, but I think the Chiefs should sign a veteran offensive lineman. The problem is, most of the offensive linemen on the market are aged and/or aging. That being said, I would not be upset if they signed former Vikings center Matt Birk (32) or even former Eagles tackle Jon Runyan (35), both of whom are well-respeced veterans who still have another good couple of years left in them. <br>  As far as I'm concerned, Matt Cassell will only be effective (if that) if he's not getting hit every time he throws the ball.<br>  <br>  We do need a lot of help on defense, but it would be better to build that up through the draft, as hiigh-profile defensive players are typically more affordable during their first few years in the league than they are after they've matured. Ray Lewis would be nice, but he just costs too much money (and is also too high-profile a risk for a new coach/GM with no prior connection to him ).|`|daRDQE9maa	Ray Lewis would be a great thought, but you have to be careful with the cap and such, and also the greatest defense is a great offense... they gotta really get going on offense if you can keep the ball no turnovers and stuff then the other team can't score..|`|bLC4b2NDaa	Jason Taylor|`|M6uIbKXRaa	they need ray lewis|`|153nXPCTaa	As a Chiefs fan my main concern is on our defensive live. When we had Jared Allen he gave us that defensive presence that we really missed last year. I would still get Aaron Curry though just because i don't really see that much talent in the d-line draft this year. Ray Lewis is aging. He has been hurt in past years and cost too much. as much as i'd love to have him i just don't see that being the right thing to do. The chiefs could have easily been sittin somewhere like 8-8 if the ball would've rolled their way just a couple more times. most of the losses was by ten or less. but a loss is alot. no where to go but up in k.c|`|AA10209306	They should go after Ray Lewis but i doubt they have the money to get him. If Jason Talyor's 8 million was to much, Ray Lewis will be to much.|`|uT0iNI2Zaa	I think they should go after Ray Lewis.|`|sIiLFofEaa	a shutdown corner.<br>  maybe shawn springs.<br>  there most likely gonna get aaron curry in the draft so no need for a free agent lb|`|lHJcjF8xaa	They will eat dinner with me.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Nope...Congratulations...The Chiefs used up all their cap room on Cassel...|`|xFfskbjYaa	The Chiefs biggest problem in my opinion was their defensive line and linebackers. They got 10 sacks all season! worst in the league! Their secondary is taking a lot of the blame, but even if you had Nnamdi, Asanti Samuel, Bob Sanders and Ed Reed in the secondary, and you don't pressure the QB and you don't get sacks, receivers will eventually get open. They draft or sign a couple big bodies up front to put the pressure on, their secondary will improve in turn. They lost by within 7 points 8 times last season. If they allowed one fewer TD during those games, sometimes even one less FG, they could have been 10-6.<br>  <br>  They need a presence on the line. Aaron Curry is who i expect for them to draft first round, but since they gave up their 2nd round pick, they better draft a "diamond in the rough" defensive lineman in the third. It's their need.

WiIUEObTaa	because the government cares about its population. live canadian province hosting 2010 winter games. its has caused extreme finical hardship to low income families. it is the stupidest thing to ever happen to our province. the cost of living went sky high. created severe homelessness. medical cutbacks. unaffordable housing. any country that wants the Olympics is making a mistake. the country of india cares more about its population than spending millions of dollars to find a chemist to juice its athletes . the population does not care . the government does not care. cricket is the second most popular sport in the world. great teams. that is all the people government want.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	It takes money to develop amateur sport to a large enough to degree to be competitive and many countries have greater needs and priorities than sport.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Even though the concept of Olympics is amateurism, it requires big amount of money for creating infrastructure, facilities, expenses on expert coaching system, medical provisions, livelihood etc. How Mr. Abhinav got gold ? He spent lot of time & money in eastern countries for practicing. He invested lot of money per year. It was possible for his family to afford the same. One has to find out how much money he has invested in his training for the period of last five to seven years. That much amount has to spent on each player to get medal in Olympics. India is not willing to invest such big amount on anyone athlete. Our politician wishes that big events should be organised by India so that they can earn %age from the said events. They think that spending one crore on Aishwarya Rai for sending her to Commonwealth games as brand ambassador & winning the bid for commonwealth games is the big issue. They do not wish to spend money on actual training programme of any of the athletes. They want big events only. This is the simple reason. Budgetary Provision is made for construction & not on actual training programme. You start spending on the training programme of the sports persons. You will find the medal winning results.

1w5blbobaa	Okkkk i think the players who had good chance of winning are....<br>  <br>  (1)SERENA WILLIAMS:-<br>  +points------She is the BEST player in the world,She had all the experinece that matter in tough situations,She knows how it feels to hold the trophy,She is one of the best clay players among the recent players(though that's her least fave surface),She can beat anyone,anywhere,anytime-if she really want it dearly,After the back-to-back win in US Open & AO her confidence is supermly boast up.<br>  <br>  -points-----Her fitness will determine her faith,there are few more player who can give tough fight.<br>  <br>  (2)VENUS WILLAMS:-<br>  <br>  +points----She is again coming back in her best form,& when Venus is playing her best She can win anything even the french,She knows how to beat the best player in the world(Serena).<br>  <br>  -points----Venus is not someone who had the best record in clay(her least fave surface again),She need to be totally fit,Serena will be the toughest opponent 4 her.<br>  <br>  <br>  (3)ANA IVANOVIC:-<br>  <br>  +points---The defending Champion will be confident,She will try 2 hold her good reputation in clay,She will like to be back in top 5.<br>  <br>  -points---The Williams sisters are playing next to best of their carrier,so She will have a tough competition there,Fitness always matters.<br>  <br>  (4)DINARA SAFINA:-<br>  <br>  +points----Last years runner up,She is playing her best tennis,She play well in clay,She had the experience of playing in the final.<br>  <br>  -points---Williams & Ana will be ahed of her--she had to beat them,She have to handle her emotion better.<br>  <br>  <br>  (5)ELENA DEMETIEVA/JELENA JANKOVIC:-<br>  +points----Both of them are fit,Elena is playing her best tennis,Jelena can is a good mover,Both had experience & both can make upsets.<br>  <br>  -points----There are few more players who are better than both of them in clay,they hv to give their best becoz others will put up good fight,so they hv 2 match up their game.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	venus|`|6S8KjBLQaa	My home girl Dementieva will beat Zvonareva in the final.

What did Lucho do for el Tri?? Nothing...he didn't make an impact on the team. Now when Sinha is there or isn't there, he is noticed! Sinha is a better creative player. Lucho isn't bad, but he ain't no Sinha.|`|tmfvKGy7aa	sinha is a better player <br>  lucho gets too nervous sometimes when hes playing<br>  and sinha has a much better control of the ball than perez...|`|eWadjRfpaa	Sinha.<br>  That is an ovious answer.|`|vvja8zEeaa	DUMB QUESTION SINHA BY FAR|`|sx78czbxaa	Neither, its me. Im better.|`|p4cgonKCaa	i am|`|Vctxf6uYaa	neither it's me all the way|`|XLwxjg25aa	Without a doubt Sinha is better than Lucho. He is a play maker. When he is in the Mexican lineup you see Mexico move the ball on the ground instead of resorting to long range inaccurate passes. Even in the loss against the United States when he came in as a late substitution he made a significant difference in getting Mexico to manage the ball. Not one of Mexico's better performances because all they did throughout the game was try to get the ball to Ochoa by means of balonazos.

KMASS2Gmaa	Do not sweat it. The build up of enough lead for damage to animals or humans requires years of water flow through lead pipes or old copper pipes soldered together by lead/tin solder and the submersion of a couple of rounds with lead or jacked slugs will not even have lost a single molecule.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	no lead poisoning. maybe on a ppm (parts per million) level, but not enough to cause harm. get those bullets out of that water asap, before your cats eat it by accident. then you'll have problems. <br>  <br>  by bullet you mean projectile (bullet) or the cartridge? if its a 30-30 and 30-06 cartridge then the cats will not eat that by accident (its too big) and you should get that out of there anyway since the brass case will tarnish in the water and possibly poison the water enough to make your cats sick. Change the water as an added cat sickness prevention measure.|`|vea6mqPZaa	I would not worry about it.<br>  <br>  The amount of lead transferred from the rounds to the water is slim to none.<br>  <br>  You have had more contact with the lead in ammo than they got from the water and that takes into account for you body mass.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Don't fret it there is not enough lead exposed on them to do any harm|`|kQSSz2X2aa	The amount of lead that could have potentially gotten into your cat's system is very small. I wouldn't worry about it, just wash the water dish.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	The cats will be fine. Your not going to get lead transfer of any significant amount in a couple hours. I think you may also want to concern yourself with the cartridges themselves. It is possible that water could have seeped in and compromised the powder or primer. I suggest you set them aside for use at the shooting range just in case. A miss fire while hunting can be a lost opportunity.|`|8VrlRUfhaa	Look at and monitor the cats closely for the next few days. Pay particular attention to their eating habits. Do they lack energy, do they get listless, do they want to sleep all of the time? If so, they are cats, if not, they still might be cats, or democrats.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Even if they were lead, you have nothing to worry about. Seriously. Anyone who says your cat is in danger is an idiot.|`|AA12034449	In my real life I work in industrial safety... and do lead and asbestos abatement.<br>  <br>  If it was not for the cat "back wash" in the water dish I would drink the water...you have more injested lead from solder in your copper pipe joints daily than what you could get soaking a bullet for years.

But who would throw him the ball in Minnesota?  Yeah he would get a lot of single coverage because of Berrian on the other side and AD in the backfield, but there still isn't a solid answer for the Vikings at QB.  I would like to see him come to Minnesota as I am a Vikings fan, but I believe he will end up in Philly or back in Cinci.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just read today he is considering offers from Minnesota, Cinncinati, and Seattle and that he will decide sometime today.  Not sure where he's going because none of the details of the offers were released.|`|AwPQC7e9aa	Possibly Minnesota, because Bernard Berrian will be a better player as the 2nd option in their offense. He could end up in Tennesee also, they don't have any huge play recievers, they could really use him. I could see him going to Jacksonville, because once again, they have no big play people at the WR position. I hope he is smart enough to steer clear of Oakland and Detroit. I could also see Miami, Buffalo, or Tampa picking him up.|`|AA11382138	If Marvin and TJ both come, the Eagles will have their WR depth chart look like this:<br>  <br>  TJ<br>  Marvin<br>  D.

LdJFFvSVaa	It's just a tune not actually a well known song
SEsFmo0yaa	When you say marking I assume you mean defensively.<br>  <br>  Team defence is about organisation and the speed at which you do it. A good defensive team will mark man for man so it will be fairly obvious which attacker you're up against. At set pieces you should (generally) be marking your opposite number, depending on which position you play. At 2nd phase and above you just mark the attacker in front of you whatever their position.<br>  <br>  However this isn't always the case and sometimes you're either outnumbered by attackers or facing someone of a differing position. With experience comes instinct and when the opposition has an overlap you learn which player to rush and when to drift. Without knowing more about your position I can't give you too much more info beyond man marking.<br>  <br>  When faced with a one-on-one marking an individual attacker the best advice is to watch his hips. Too many people make the mistake of watching the ball, their feet or looking in their eyes and are sold by a quick dummy or sidestep (which is always embarrassing). They may shape to go one way with the intention of going the other but generally their hips face the direction they intend on going. <br>  <br>  When joining the defensive line speak to the teammates inside and outside and tell them who you're marking, make a decision and stick to it. A massive part of defensive is trust based and if you all know who you're marking then it will be much easier to defend as well as giving you a very clear target to tackle.|`|2xlCj4utaa	well your opposite number should take priority.and then any one else. mark your man and tackle the hell out of him.good luck|`|g1ZH0iDlaa	all the first guy said but knock em out|`|WnTHyxAiaa	keep your eye on the opposition, try to stay parallel infront of him.  when he moves right, you move right, when he moves left you move left, always stand in a straight line infront of him.  and always, i mean always!!! tackle your man, if he dummys a pass or even makes a pass, by god just tackle the bastard, "better safe then sorry"

The bunks are adjustable up and down to fit the angle of your hull.  Typically, the winch strap on a jet ski or waverunner is a different than for a full sized boat.  Specifically, the winch strap for my WaveRunner is configured to fit in the small slot on the ski.  A full-sized boat usually has an eyebolt on the front of it and the winch strap then has a metal hook to connect to the eyebolt.<br>  <br>  Common brands are Shorelander, Shoreline, Cutter, etc.
tX4RNX1faa	First off it sounds like you were not prepared to be on the team and never got into shape before you showed up for practice. By preparing yourself mentally you would have read a few books written by track stars, maybe their words would have pointed out how most coaches get rid of slackers during the first week. The problem isn't that you didn't prepare the problem is that no one in your life taught you about preparation for greatness and that comes from desire to be the best, determination to get there and dedication to do what ever it takes. You see, quitters don't win, at anything, in fact by quitting you set yourself up to quit at everything, simply by finding an excuse that gives you the idea that your excuse is good enough for you to be satisfied with losing. <br>  "Show me a good loser and I will show you a loser." That saying sinks it's teeth into those who practice getting better at losing because they don't know how to prepare for winning. Winning isn't everything though.... Winning is the ONLY thing. The only D's allowed in school are dedication, determination and desire, if you don't have that grasp of mental and physical warfare (competitive sport) you aren't a competitive athlete. If you want them..... go to the library and get a few books about winning and preparation.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Since you have just started maybe you should wait a little while to decide.<br>  Because you had a very bad day doesn't mean you won't do better. <br>  13 degrees is very cold, so you can't judge how you will do after you are in better condition and it is warmer.<br>  Try to have a good attitude and enjoy yourself if that is possible.<br>  Once you get to try different events you could find something you enjoy doing, track is not just running 2 miles.

lEX3CjWlaa	Yes - you need running shoes. Most athletic shoes are designed for a specific sport. Tennis shoes are for tennis. They are more flexible from side to side as there is a lot of movement in playing tennis that way. Running shoes are designed to prevent pronation and suppination (i.e. rolling your feet in or out on the sides while running).<br>  <br>  Don't use tennis shoes or else, if you keep at running, you'll hurt you feet, legs and hips.<br>  <br>  Best would be to go to a shop that specializes in running shoes (and related sports shoes and equipment). They'll sell you good shoes that are right for you. You'll pay more - but it will save your feet and legs in the long run. Don't buy them at a Walmart or Kmart etc. They don't have the expertise about running or the pair of shoes you would need.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and Hope this Helps|`|8iQcbgVTaa	asics or new balance|`|bQB95fTPaa	Adidas do the best running shoes and try rubbing some vaseline on ur feet bfor running.. it just helps =]|`|XTLN8D2Qaa	you need a running shoes:)

zg1lIy7Oaa	The Unstoppables - the guys who were pure long distance bombers who could also score with the best of them, and were also clearly unstoppable. Fortunately for these guys, they stand in a very short line.<br>  <br>  1. LARRY BIRD, Boston Celtics (1979-91):<br>  <br>  Bird is definitely one of the NBA's all-time best scorers, but he is also one of the best pure shooters, too. His shooting form might have looked normal, but his release was excellent; especially while watching it in slow motion. Aside from his MVPs and championships, Bird also won three consecutive three point shootout titles, and is one of only two players in league history to have three shootout titles. Bird has 649 total three pointers in his career, but is nowhere near the top 30 all-time leaders in three point field goals made.<br>  <br>  2. REGGIE MILLER, Indiana Pacers (1987-2005):<br>  <br>  Miller is without a doubt the greatest shooter of the 90s. As great as scorer as Miller was, he is mostly known for shooting lights out from long distance. Reggie was the master of catching and shooting, and only Michael Jordan has scored more points than him at the shooting guard position. His 25-point fourth quarter in the 1994 playoffs against New York, where he scored two three pointers in a span of three second is the one highlight of his career we will never forget. He's also one of the NBA's greatest players to never win a championship. Simply put, the greatest three-point clutch shooter of this generation.<br>  <br>  Sliky Smooth Js - Players who had the prettiest shooting forms fit in this category. Shooting forms that make you think to yourself, "man, now that's a pretty shot." In other words, pure textbook shooters.<br>  <br>  1. DAN MAJERLE, Phoenix Suns/Cleveland Cavaliers/Miami Heat (1988-2002):<br>  <br>  Thunder Dan wasn't a deadly scorer, but he sure was deadly from long range. He had one of the quickest releases, making it nearly impossible for defenders to block. Majerle is 11th all-time in three point field goals made, and is still second all-time in most three point field goals made in an NBA Finals game.<br>  <br>  2. GLEN RICE, Miami Heat/Charlotte Hornets/L.A. Lakers/New York Knicks/Houston Rockets/L.A. Clippers (1989-2004):<br>  <br>  One of the more underrated scorers in NBA history--Rice's silky smooth jump shot was just too beautiful for words. Rice was the definition of "pure shooter", and shot 40 percent from long range during his career. Rice finished third in the league in scoring in 1997, trailing only Karl Malone and Michael Jordan. He also shot 47 percent from deep the same season. G Money, one of game's most prolific shooters.<br>  <br>  3. RAY ALLEN, Milwaukee Bucks/Seattle Supersonics/Boston Celtics (1996-present):<br>  <br>  Allen is the best pure shooter in the game today, period. Not only that, but he has secured his place in NBA history as one of the game's all-time best shooters. No other human being can duplicate his form, no matter how much time they put in the gym. Even Reggie Miller proclaims Allen as the game's best shooter, and maybe second all-time after Miller. His performance in the 2001 three point shootout contest is one of the best moments in three-point shootout history.To end it off, the prettiest stoke you'll ever see.<br>  <br>  4. ALLAN HOUSTON, Detroit Pistons/New York Knicks (1993-2005): <br>  <br>  Allan's smooth touch was just as smooth as Glen Rice's, if not smoother. Houston is 14th all-time in three pointer made, and was one of the league's prolific scorers in the mid 90s and early 00s. H20 was explosive off the dribble, and probably had his career cut short because of nagging knee problems.<br>  <br>  5. DELL CURRY, Utah Jazz/Cleveland Cavaliers/Charlotte Hornets/Milwaukee Bucks/Toronto Raptors (1986-2002):<br>  <br>  Curry was the big fundamental when it came to shooting. he shot 40 percent from deep from his career, and is 23rd all-time in three pointers made. You might have heard of his son, Stephon Curry from Davidson, who has taken after his father as a pure shooter.<br>  <br>  The Best Of the Rest<br>  <br>  1. MARK PRICE, CLEVELAND CAVALIERS/Washington Bullets/Golden State Warriors/Orlando Magic (1986-98):<br>  <br>  Price is the best pure shooting point guard to ever play the game. Aside from having one of the all-time best three point field goal percentages in NBA history, Price is also first all-time in free throw percentage. Before LeBron James ruled Cleveland, Price was the last guy known as a icon to the Cavs' organization.<br>  <br>  2. PEJA STOJAKOVIC, Sacramento Kings/Indiana Pacers/New Orleans Hornets (1998-present):<br>  <br>  Peja has an awkward slingshot release, but he's still one of the best pure shooters in the game today. He is already eighth all-time in total three pointers made, and is on pace to make his way into the top five of that list when it's all over for him. Peja Stojakovic: awkward, but effective.<br>  <br>  3. CRAIG HODGES, San Diego Clippers/ Milwaukee Bucks/Phoenix Suns/Chicago Bulls (1982-91):<br>  <br>  Hodges is one of the best pure shooters of all-time, but many have never heard of him. He is mostly known for his|`|darlMpMQaa	Bird was a 37% three point shooter while Miller was a 40% three point shooter.  So they both had their strengths and are both two of the best shooters to play the game.  But I would give this to Bird for when he made his shots.  And rings don't lie.|`|DBnaXEWKaa	Very Very close, i mean we all have our own opinions i just think Larry Bird is by far the best. And aparentally so do many others|`|V48H3aWQaa	I like Miller, but I have to go with Bird. Miller is a close second.|`|TAm1omwCaa	Larry Bird|`|bLC4b2NDaa	I think More Larry Bird or even Ray Allen|`|qnfEEpS6aa	That has to be Larry Bird hands down|`|0GgFCAnKaa	no. LARRY|`|21J0IIZbaa	Bird is the greatest shooter to play in the NBA.  Miller is second.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	No,it's Larry Bird and Miller's second,as third and fourth on the all time shooting list are Dirk Nowitzki and Ray Allen,Mark Price as fifth bu i'm going to tell you.<br>  <br>  Current best shooters in the nba Nowitzki and Allen <br>  are sharp shooters and Bird and Miller are sharp all time shooters too. plus Price.These guys were able and some of them stilll are(Nowitzki and Allen)able to hit a true shooting % over 80% wide open or with a defender or under presure.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	He was really good, but best ever pure shooter?  I don't know about that.<br>  <br>  There's actually a fairly long list of players (some active some retired -  38 of them to be exact) who shoot or have shot a better percentage from the 3 point line than Reggie did.|`|qusKbEmBaa	No, but he is the best shooter that the Pacers ever had.<br>  I would say the best shooter right now is Peja Stojavicic.<br>  But overrall the best shooter is Larry Bird. Hope i helped<br>  ( I need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as best<br>  answer, thanks)|`|OWIiJMLqaa	No, but he was the best shooter the Pacers had, I would probably give Larry Bird my vote for best shooter all time.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	No LeBron is.

If you don't tape it on it will shoot off and not do anything. <br>  <br>  its also illegal to use a homemade suppressor of that type, and that is a felony crime. <br>  <br>  if yo want to make a quiet .22 shot, use CCI CB long or short ammo. Its is the quietest there is. <br>  <br>  or use a complicated setup where you fire from the inside of a confined space (example, your room) to the outside where your target is. that is not considered a suppressor but will suppress and eliminate most of the report from the outside, all the noise will be confined inside of the building, which is amplified significantly and will reverberate around. That is not a suppressor by definition and is legal. it is also a pain in the as to set up and use.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	in fact noise suppression is possible one time with a plastic bottle with subsonic rounds, however it is dangerous because the plastic generally shatter because of muzzle pressure.  and  "illegal" to use it that way as noise suppression is highly restriction under the GCA of 1968. <br>  <br>  I watched a recent episode of Shooting Gallery on suppression, they are available and legal to own in many states when you follow the regulations.

zg1lIy7Oaa	In 1933, Noel MacDonald received her basketball baptism. Joining the EDMONTON GRADS, Canada's greatest women's basketball team, the rookie was given the unenviable task of guarding Alberta Williams, Tulsa's tall centre. Surprising perhaps even herself, MacDonald outscored Williams and helped lead the Grads to victory. Before she finished playing in 1939, retiring as the Grads' captain, MacDonald would lead the Grads to success around the world.<br>  <br>  In 1915, the girls' basketball team of John A. McDougall Commercial High School in Edmonton, under the tutelage of coach Percy Page, who has been inducted as a builder into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, won the Alberta provincial championships. The women decided to continue playing following their school days and formed the Commercial Graduates' Basketball Club. Thus were born the Edmonton Grads, the most successful team, regardless of sport, male or female, in the history of Canadian sport.<br>  <br>  Between 1915 and 1940, the Grads played 522 games against both men's and women's teams around the world, winning 502 and recording winning streaks of 147 and 78 games. They lost only one provincial championship (1921) and, beginning in 1922, won the Canadian championship every year of their history. They won the first Underwood Trophy—a challenge cup contested primarily between Canadian and American women's teams in 1923 and did not relinquish the trophy in the next 17 years. Although, women's basketball was not an official Olympic sport, exhibition tournaments were held in conjunction with the 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936 Games. The Grads represented North America and went undefeated in 27 games.<br>  <br>  The standard of excellence set by the Grads in the 18 years before MacDonald joined the team made her achievements all the more remarkable. She was recruited for the Grads' feeder team, the Gradettes, out of Grade 12 at McDougall Commercial High School. She played a year-and-a half for the Gradettes before joining the Grads in 1933. In 1936, she was named captain of the squad that won the Olympic exhibition tournament in Berlin. When she retired from the Grads in 1939, MacDonald had played 135 games for the Grads and was the team's all-time leading scorer with an average of 13.8 points per game. She was called by one reporter "Canada's best female basketball player" of her era and in 1938 Canadian Press recognized her as Canada's female athlete of the year.<br>  <br>  Despite her individual success, MacDonald listened as coach Page preached the importance of team play. During her tenure with the team, the Grads won every provincial and national championship they contested. In Underwood Trophy challenges, the Grads defended the cup 20 straight times between 1933 and 1939, winning 57 games and losing only three in the process.<br>  <br>  MacDonald retired after marrying Harry Robertson, a one-time world champion hockey player, in 1939. She served on the executive of the Canadian Amateur Basketball Association and took up coaching. She coached girls' high school basketball in both Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as at the University of Alberta.

CQgNXXsbaa	Don't listen to Sean R. He's probably like uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite and can throw a football over those mountains and would have been a pro if he hadn't blown out his knee or something like that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, YOUR NUMBERS ARE FINE! Actually better than fine. They're very good. And you probably know that but want to post them so the world can see them. But since you're asking for advice as well I'll throw out my 2 cents.<br>  <br>  First don't listen to people on Yahoo! about what you should do. Talk with the person that make decisions about who's going to play... Your coach. He's going to tell you more than you really want to know, but that's his job. He coaches. He teaches. He wants to make his team better and by making his players better his team gets better. Start there.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do right now is work on your field of vision and your football knowledge. Use the time you spent/spend on JV to help you learn how to run. Where to run. And how to increase your reaction time/decision making skills. You can put the football on a horse but if the horse doesn't know where the end zone is it's not gonna score. Your knowledge is your most important tool. <br>  <br>  When you run with the ball to you see the holes or do you follow the play? One of the greatest NFL players in history rarely went through the hole the play said to go through. He was good in his ability to ad-lib and make a play out of nothing. Maybe you've heard of him...Barry Sanders.<br>  <br>  One thing that's controlable for your right now is your weight. 155 is a little small for a 4 quarter back. If you're gonna carry a game you need to be able to run the ball 25-30 time per game. That's IF you have a balanced offense. Most high schools rely on the run closer to 80% of the game so you realistically need to touch the ball closer to 40 times per game and at 155 you're gonna get hit that many times at least. Over the course of a year with around 10 games that's 400+ collisions. Your size makes it harder for you to endure that much punishment game in and game out. Talk with your Doctor/Coach about ways to increase mass without messing with your speed.<br>  <br>  So, in summary, the most important thing for you is to keep in close communication with your coach.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|4YhZLIRFaa	You need to get that 40 time down.  The best way to do this is with a weight sled.  See if your trainer has a weight sled or something similar.  It's simply a metal sled that you stack plates onto and sprint at full speed with it strapped to you.  This helped me cut .35 off my 40.  I went from a 4.8 to a 4.45.  Your other lifts are solid and will continue to rise as you keep working hard.  By senior year get that squat to 500, bench to 275, and clean up around 250.  Good luck!|`|xfJuyHoeaa	Stamp what G B said|`|HMv6jvUCaa	those are pretty good numbers, Try to bulk up on more muscle, so you deliver blows and be a better blocker. Just be careful not to loose any speed as you're bulking up.<br>  <br>  And DON'T use things like crietine, it will make you bigger not stronger which is what you want. Keep a good mix of vitamins, a good diet, and strong work outs and you'll be fine.

His best days are definitely behind him, and he's overweight again, but he can still put on a decent match, and he still has a lot of fans.  He's not in PPV main event shape, so I don't think he'll be in the match, even a triple threat.<br>  <br>  I don't think Vickie has any real intention of risking her husband's title against a giant.  I think it was more a wake-up call to Edge.  She's getting more self-confident lately, and she's been disappointed with Edge's performances; she even berates him now.  I think this was Vickie's way of telling Edge he had better step up his game, stop being made a fool of by his opponents, and to stop looking to her to bail him out of his troubles.<br>  <br>  I think we're going to get a one-on-one title match at Wrestlemania.  Edge vs John Cena, but that doesn't mean the Big Show won't interfere in it somehow.  Depending on how Vickie feels about Edge that night, Big Show will either help him retain, or help him lose the title.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	He is amazingly talented and he truly deserve his main event status back, maybe for a short time but he deserve it in return to all the contribution he had done towards this business in last 15+ years.

TAPBWPJLaa	Possibly.<br>  <br>  But I think that's one of the goals with the MITB match this year.

Nejnh1Bqaa	Success at the college level doesn't necessarily translate to success at the professional level.  There could be a number of factors that come in to play in this.  The late round draft picks didn't have anything given to them, so they had to work harder to get where they are.   You could argue that they weren't expected to succeed, and weren't under any pressure to do so.  Maybe they are just better players.  Drew Brees isn't really a low round draft pick, he was number 1 in the second round, which is still a pretty high spot in the draft.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	If you broke down the percentage of players by the round they were drafted, you would find a normal curve where most players were drafted in the 1st round, the next most players in the 2nd round, the next most players in the 3rd round, etc.<br>  <br>  America loves the guy that excels that was not expected to excel.<br>  <br>  A few of the folks you mentioned above were 2nd rounders, which hardly qualifies as a later round.  Brees and Johnson specifically were 2nd round picks.|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	Of course there are more good players in 6 rounds together than in only one.<br>  <br>  Now compare percentages, what percent of first rounders become stars and what percent of later rounders do so? Of course the percent of first rounders is much higher.<br>  <br>  Peyton Manning, Philip Rivers, Champ Bailey, Walter Jones, Ryan Clady, Adrian Peterson, Andre Johnson, Randy Moss, Nnamdi Asomugha, Troy Polamalu, Larry Fitzgerald (I know there is a LOT more).|`|Oes7TRNVaa	yea the whole 1st round thing is overrated.

Also wall splits may help. Lay on your back with your butt up against the wall and push your legs down into a split. This will help with height. Don't forget straight legs and point your toes.

UxooffHZaa	If I were getting a new franchise, and could steal any coach off a team, I'd go with Mike Tomlin from the Steelers. Young, smart, motivating, successful. But, is he the best? Probably still Belicheck.|`|nRSjUKJZaa	I'd have to say Bill Belichick or Mike Shanahan, I have a lot respect for for both of them. They both know the game very well and have taken their teams (well former team for Shanny) to Super Bowl victories.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Bill Belicheck (sp?) Many people are saying Mike Tomlin well because the bandwagon came early this year|`|mTSOJKlyaa	Tony Dungy<br>  <br>  just a few reasons:<br>  <br>  139-69-0 (regular season record)<br>  148-79-0 (overall record)<br>  2 Super Bowl victories (1 played 1 coached)<br>  Only coach in club history to produce 10-plus victories and playoff berths in the first four seasons with the team.<br>  He turned around the Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts.<br>  Dungy is the first NFL head coach to defeat all 32 NFL teams.<br>  He was also the youngest assistant coach at age 25, and the youngest coordinator at age 28 in NFL history.<br>  Dungy was the first black head coach to win the Super Bowl<br>  Dungy also became the sixth man to play in a Super Bowl and be the head coach of a Super Bowl team.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	personally I think its Mike Shanahan.  I know he isnt actually a coach right now but that wont be for long.  He knows the game inside and out an the record speaks for itself.  He has a good working relationship with the players and knows how to treat them away from the field also.|`|43f9Ctozaa	I like Tony Dungy because he goes against the grain of a screaming intense coach but he still wins and he did it in more than  on place.|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	homer answer....mike tomlin.<br>  <br>  youngest coach to win the superbowl.  <br>  <br>  2 rings already at age 36 (both as coaches)<br>  <br>  1st year as head coach he won division and made playoffs, also led league with #1 defense.....no cowher hangover as was expected by many.<br>  <br>  2nd year won division, won superbowl and again finished with #1 defense (what do you expect from a defensive-minded coach?)<br>  <br>  third year?  we'll see soon enough, but not sure what more he can accomplish, maybe back to back lombardi's?   <br>  <br>  and i don't wanna hear the "he walked into a good team" bit.  half the people on here think the steelers suck so you can't say that then.  to come in and not miss a beat where cowher left off, maintaining the standard of winning in the organization, that is a feat upon itself.  most seamless coaching transition i've ever seen.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	Well I guess you gotta go with the guy they named the Trophy for, Vince Lombardi.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	You could check out the WWE Fan Nation Forum for a few more ideas and opinions on that.<br>  <a href="http://fans.wwe.com/go/forum/view/691/901/Divas" rel="nofollow">http://fans.wwe.com/go/forum/view/691/90...</a>|`|Q1MI6L96aa	There has been a backlash growing with the Divas for some time and that could be the reason why even WWE fans may say the Knockouts are important to the TNA show. The whole Diva concept has had a great run, but has been getting stale because so many of the ladies simply don't work well in the ring (or have any mic skills). <br>  <br>  Gail Kim is going to help things out, but the company may have to take the women's division in a different direction.|`|QY4Hy00qaa	Look the Divas used to be important when the wwe actually had women who could wrestle, in my opinion the TNA Knockouts are way better because they are real wrestlers.

WsuvtfUaaa	i think the reason he has not and probably never will is the same reason mark martin has not and never will. dale earnhardt didnt win his 7 championships by being mr. nice guy on the track. jeff and mark(as much as they both deserve it) need to shed the good guy images and show a little attitude on the track.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	He is a great driver but he has had a lot of bad luck at the wrong time. I think that he has a great chance to win a Championship and I hope he will before he retires.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	I just don't think they ever got it going on good enough @ the 99 team when he was w/ Roush. Something just wasn't right...<br>  <br>  and 5 years w/ Childress is quite a while.. I thought he would have done it by now but it just hasn't happened for ol' Burton. Hopefully it will one day...|`|55buQ8rBaa	Jimmie Johnson and Jeff Gordon|`|GCOrku95aa	Like everyone else said, he's not aggressive enough on the track, he won't move a guy out of the way to make a pass.<br>  <br>  Unlike what the others said, Mark Martin would have won the 1990 championship, if Richard Childress hadn't complained to NASCAR after the Richmond race and officials found something that had no affect on performance(it passed in pre-race inspection), but Mark lost 46 points and subsequently the championship by 26 points to Dale Earnhardt. But, hey, who holds grudges in NASCAR?|`|PJhwWVcMaa	Jeff Burton has always been a consistently good driver almost every season but he never seems to be that great dominant driver that can take over a race or dominate a stretch of the season. I really like Jeff Burton but I don't think he will ever win a championship and time is running out on him too. He's already in his 40s and very few drivers have won their first championship that late in their career.|`|9vcZjFl6aa	you dont have to take somebody out and possibly yourself to win a championship gordon dint do it johnson didnt doit you need luck and good points racing getting 5 bonus points if you are a 5 th place car and you know u cant catch a guy take the 5 th lol no pun intended|`|ZMPvSH7uaa	catfish thinks it is like why mark martin has not one one.

Mark Martin and he were teammates at roush for years, I think Mark rubbed off on him.

LOL.|`|vkT7xRuxaa	I think he has a shot, but he is certainly Childress' best shot for another 2 years. Bowyer still isnt mature enough to win one, and Harvick never will. Burton was not as consistent as Bobby Labonte in 2000 and that's why he hasnt won one yet. Then Roush fell off and Burton's relationship with them was ruined, he went to childress, and finally started figuring it all out in 2006.|`|AAWiFvhAaa	Interesting question, because I don't think there's an easy answer to the first part. He's a smart driver and a good one. I'm not sure being a little more aggressive would help, really, because for a lot of drivers, it becomes a high risk/ high rewards scenario that is heavy on the former and light on the latter. <br>  Right now, I'd be a bit concerned about RCR cars having what it takes to make that short stride from competitive to winning.

AA11570394	Jeff gave a good answer.<br>  <br>  Simple answer; yes.<br>  Millions of American hunters used nothing but  2 ? shells for ducks, geese and upland game hunting, and they did well. When the 3 in shells came out most used them for goose, duck and turkey. Basically the 3 in just holds more shot than the 2 2/4.<br>  But the question arises of what choke you have. You see those older 870 Wingmaster had a bit softer steel barrels than the modern ones for steel shot and some were full choke. If it’s a fixed full choke and you shoot steel shot through it, it’s going to score the bore at the choke. Steel will not compress like lead shot and is much harder. If you have a , cylinder bore, modified or improved cylinder which are a more open choke you will fair better. Or as Jeff said use the right screw in choke. But steel shot loads are not ment for full chokes at all, better patterns are achieved with a wider choke. I tested this myself with many different loads and three different shotguns last fall. All three, the Mossberg 500, rem 870 and a browning A-5 all shot better patterns with wider chokes then full chokes, with steel shot.<br>  <br>  If it’s a fixed full choke I would consider buying a new barrel for it designed for steel shot. These can be had with interchangeable chokes. I have seen then go used in good condition for $100 or less, new around $160 to $200 and up. This is what I did for the Wingmaster my wife likes. I shopped around and found a used 18 in riot barrel and a high rib 28 in inter/choke barrel, both for $150 used.|`|AA12034449	If you are shooting in a steel shot area... steel shot works a little better in 3 or 3.5 inch loads... there is a weight vs volume issue when steel shot is compared to lead. You can get more steel in the longer hull and it will carry a lot farther with authority.<br>  <br>  Steel shot at closer ranges works ok from 2 3/4 heavy loads... I've never had trouble with ducks or geese at 30 yards or so ...<br>  <br>  You dont say how the gun is choked. If you have a treaded bbl for tubes you may want to try a full choke and some of the inserts marked for steel shot on a pattern board to see how you shot strings at given ranges. I like to see about 80% of the pellets hit a 30 inch circle at 40 yards or so for waterfowl.|`|bkhvdfJxaa	you can..but your going to be stuck using 2 3/4 shell only...and you cant take the advantage of the more powder 3 and 3 1/2 shells....which would help in getting the higher up in the sky game, and deeper bb penetration..|`|hoZnJVXXaa	You can still lethally kill as many geese and ducks with a 2 3/4" shell as a 3 1/2".<br>  <br>  You will not be able to shot as far, but if you have the correct choke tube (pattern master, Kicks high flyers) with a load of #2 and #4's for ducks, and maybe BBB - BB for the geese.<br>  <br>  <br>  You will only be shooting a little lighter load, but the speed is about the same on them.<br>  <br>  I have shot many of ducks and geese with a 20 gauge 7/8" load.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and happy hunting<br>  ~JB|`|97Uojcu3aa	It's true, hunters have been killing waterfowl for years w/2 3/4" shells.  A 2 3/4" magnum load has an effective killing range of 60+ yards using #2 steel for ducks and BB's for Geese.  Here's the trick:  You gotta hit them!!!  That takes practice, practice, practice!  Most hunters don't get enough.  Your local trap range will be able to help.  You need to have a good idea of what your pattern and shot string look like to be really effective.  Yes, more shot helps a little, but the pattern stays the same shape, it just gets more dense.  YOU MUST HAVE THE TARGET INSIDE THE PATTERN or all the shot in the world will do you absolutely no good.  Enough preaching!  From your question I deduce that you do not know your firearm well yet.  Go to the range and play around with some different loads, get to know how your gun shoots and then think about different barrels and chokes. wd|`|DV4xyeChaa	look at cabala's..cheap as dirt or other gun accessory's sites...you can get a 3 or 3 1/2 inch chamber barrel that fits on your gun...takes 30 seconds....i have a slug bbl and a 2 3/4 in field bbl 28 inch mod choke and a 30 inch full choke 3 inch bbl for my win 1200.

tHLMYNTYaa	One never understands the mind of Manny.<br>  If he wants to play, he can be a great hitter, not much of an outfielder.<br>  If he gets pissed off about something, he just won't play for the team, like he did with the Red Sox.<br>  I don't think the Dodgers can win their division. The Giants have the staff but little hitting, so if the Dodgers have a good year they just might win the division.  My opinion is Dodgers will finish 2nd.|`|S8BCApc5aa	I think they were favorites to win the division to begin with, this probably just solidifies their hold on a playoff spot.<br>  <br>  I actually think this is a better deal for the Dodgers all things considered than the two-year $45 million lock down. Giving Manny the option for next year works really well, since if he goes headcase or decides he's worth more than he's being paid, he won't be the Dodgers' headache anymore. I don't think either of those things will happen this season - I expect a good year from him, but I do expect a decline from last year. But, the rest of the lineup around Manny should be getting better - you have a ton of young players just entering their prime.<br>  <br>  And on a side note, signing Orlando Hudson was okay I guess, though I don't see him as a huge upgrade over Blake DeWitt.<br>  <br>  I would expect a division title for the Dodgers, anything less would be a failure considering there's only one other serious contender in that division (Arizona), but I think they'll have a tough time making it out of the first round of the playoffs again.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Mannywood part 2.  The NL west is one of the few divisions that a dominant slugger can make the difference in winning the division.

In other words, I have no clue what to expect there..|`|5xIroQjMaa	We can expect to be in the playoffs. World Series is a possibility with Manny. We lost a few pitchers, but our lineup and defense is now secure. The starting rotation will miss Lowe, but with Wolfe there now, it should do alright.

Still, he shows good potential for a closer.|`|VwccuEFHaa	since they used their entire offseason sweating over this, i'd say he had better perform.

I find it ironic that Native Americans "invented" the game of soccer, while Europeans came up with rugby, since the majority of Americans favor "American Football" and Europeans prefer what we call Soccer.<br>  <br>  No I don't think it has much to do with being isolated from other countries that like soccer. Mexico and Canada are both bigger than American when it comes to international leagues. American played Mexico last month (and won) but no one seemed to care.<br>  <br>  Soccer isn't gay. If anything its even more physical than American Football. We knock each other down and don't have any sort of padding other than shin guards. I know of a guy who got killed during a High School Soccer match, he fell into the goal post and cracked his skull.|`|qfCjhtgQaa	Americans love soccer!  There are a lot of people who let the television convince them of whats what, and thats their problem.<br>  <br>  Ex: Football (Gridiron) is a mans sport? My response: Then what with all the pads. Any more protection and the NFL might as well pad the turf. And I guess guys that played soccer in high school for some reason didn't get all excited about tackling or wrestling other guys and wearing tight pants.<br>  <br>  Also, some Americans love comercials.  NFL, NBA, MLB all have a ridiculous amount of commercials and thus down time. <br>  <br>  If guys feel less masculine around people that like soccer you could at least keep your insecurities and complexes about what makes you "seem" more cool in front of others to yourself.  Believe me...its a personal problem.  Don't be that guy.

JyR2ENkVaa	Hi, that is really a hard question to answer because all manufactures very in how they build there suspensions. Some use air, some air over oil. Also you may want to change the pressure for different types of trail conditions.  Your best bet is to get the manufactures name and style of shock from your suspension shocks, then Google that info and you should get results on the best settings to start with. Don't be afraid to experiment also with your style of riding.<br>  Good luck.|`|lCINuMJbaa	Since you have suspension the tire pressure is not all that relevant unless you are doing serious down hill riding. If you are, then what kind of tires you have really play a part in pressure not your weight.<br>  <br>  I have a feeling your not flying DH pulling corners and skidding through turns so I would start around 45psi and move up or down from there based on the feel of the trail.|`|l5cxmTb9aa	I hate to say it but you're just going to have to use trial and error. If the bike or shock have no guidelines, start out with a psi equal to your weight. If that's way too stiff cut it in half. Then add or subtract to fine tune. I had two bikes that both had the Fox RP23 rear shock. One was great at 150psi where the other was good around 110psi because of the difference in the rear suspension and linkage.

During his career he studied many other styles and combined them to create his first style. (don't remember the name right now...) Then he realized that he will always be adding and taking away techniques as long as he keeps improving himself, so he threw away the first style and created Jeet Kun Do.  JKD is a style of no style where you learn all that you can and keep what you like and throw out what you don't. (more of a philosophy than a style really)  There are plenty of people who claim MMA is following the JKD philosophy, but I would personally argue against it.  MMA folks tends to usually keep the styles they practice complete in it's original form where as JKD was suppose to throw out what doesn't really work for you. (minor difference, MMA folks respect the art they practice and Bruce respected the ppl who practiced the arts.)<br>  <br>  Jet Li is not the son of Bruce Lee. (that was Brandon Lee)  Jet Li began as a WuShu champion in China.  I believe he started with long fist and moved on to many different styles.  Due to his champion status and his fame he has had the chance to practice many styles under many masters.  Jet Li, unlike Bruce Lee, has not created his own style nor fought a MA match.  Jet Li is very philosophical like Bruce Lee.

I'm an American born to Italian parents as well and I think it's great that he's playing for gli azzurri...I wouldn't want him to play for the US :-) I guess it's because I grew up watching Italian football and supporting the Italian national team rather than the US soccer team.|`|9EkwyFB8aa	un fortunately yes  unless they will not play in their home countries side as i feel its wrecking englands chances of winning as our players are too well known|`|O5KOwhovaa	They should only be allowed to play for the country they are born in.

Their pitching is the weak link, but it's not as bad as some like to make out. The only problem is they're relying on alot of young arms to get it done, and the lack of veteran presence could hurt, especially late in the season.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	It helped, but there are no guarantees. The west is so weak any team has a legitimate shot. I think the Padre's and the D' Backs wil be floating around .500 this year, that's enough to make it a race in that division. And the Giants will be better this year too, I don't see this year being any different than the last several years. 90 wins will probably clinche the division.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Nobody is guaranteed the NL West this year, IMO. Once again, no one team really stands out, and a record slightly above .500 could win it. <br>  <br>  I'm just glad the deal is done. I was getting sick of hearing about it every day.|`|UVTT6DVWaa	yes|`|OTPqbHkiaa	Contrary to the signing of Manny Ramirez, the Dodgers pitching need to be the key to win the West. The D-Backs may got the pitching depth but can their starters repeat Cy Young performance ALL the way towards the end of the season instead of losing it after the All-Star break? The Giants will be a team to beat with their pitching but their offense remain shallow and lopsided. Since the Dodgers are the only team in the West with depth in the both the starting pitching rotation and their hitting. Their Achilles' heel will be their bullpen though.|`|frrFZTxhaa	Their offense may be the best in the entire NL<br>  1. Furcal .286 avg 40 SB<br>  2. Hudson .282 avg 10 SB<br>  3. Ramierez .314 avg 35 HR<br>  4. Martin .285 avg 18 SB 15 HR<br>  5. Loney .303 avg 15 HR<br>  6. Ethier .299 avg 20 HR<br>  7. Kemp .299 avg 20 HR 35 SB<br>  8. Blake .264 avg 20 HR<br>  <br>  Those are just the career averages - which will more than likely continue to get better for the youngsters. As long as they stay healthy, they will be tough to beat.<br>  <br>  As far as pitching goes.<br>  1. Billingsly 3.33 era 8K+/9<br>  2. Kuroda 3.73 era 1.22 whip<br>  3. Kershaw 4.26 era 8K+/9<br>  4. Wolf 4.26 era 7K+/9<br>  5.Schmidt/Stults/FA ????<br>  <br>  Broxton is a monster, and they got Mota back to the set up role were he flourishes.<br>  <br>  Nothing is guarenteed - but I would make them the odds on favorites to win the west - and they will definitely win 90+ games this year.|`|xRQfCdKOaa	There are never guarantees in baseball. 1 player doesn't make a team a champion. It also takes other players to have career years. At least above average years. As far as their pitching. Like almost every team they could use some help in pitching also. I hope the Dodgers have a good year.|`|5dbfad44e3cd1c8618d6ccb2ac19dcbeaa	they have a horrible pitching lineup<br>  <br>  you never know if manny will act up because they made him work for his money.<br>  <br>   I go with the diamondbacks on this one.|`|T5BshhZWaa	dunno|`|CSDlp4Igaa	no<br>  in my opinion manny is a joke|`|M0eyMvqlaa	The division isn't going to just come to them. They still have to compete with the Diamondbacks and Giants for it. Even with Manny coming back, I still believe that the Diamondbacks are going to win the NL West. I did think that the Rockies were going to do something special, but Jeff Francis went down and without their ace healthy, that's a no no. So definitely, the Diamondbacks for the win. Peace!

Y26eOD9Caa	My personal self defense choices/tips:<br>  <br>  Be armed at all times. If you are a grown adult, going about your daily buisiness, you won't be getting into ego fights.  You are more likely to get mugged, or involved in a road rage attack.  The people that come at you are likely to be armed.  A gun is fine, if you are responsible enough to own and use one properly.  Next is a knife. Again, be careful how you use it.  They are simple, you slash or stab your attacker on the closest available limb, and run away.  But be responsible and use common sense.  Impact weapons. A retractable baton where legal.  Or a Kubaton for reienforced hammerfist strikes to vital and vulnerable body areas.  Or improvised weapons.  A good pen can be used as a Kubaton or a stabbing weapon a rolled up magazine is an alternative to an expandable baton.<br>  <br>  Use awareness.  If you see trouble coming, it's easier to avoid.<br>  <br>  Training:  People will tell you you need years and years of training to defend yourself.  That's false.  If we needed to spend decades in training, we would all be victims.  There are "tricks" you can learn in a short amount of time. The knife hand, the palm strike, elbow strikes, hammer fists, straight punches and knees can all be practiced and perfected in short time, and you don't need a lot of equipment, or any for that matter.  Not all of us have time or money for training.  Just remember, you are looking to fight for self preservation, not to prove you are tough.  Take them by surprise, hit hard, and escape.<br>  <br>  More than one attacker?  Run, use a weapon, or go completely berserk and attack with all the aggression at your disposal.<br>  <br>  If it's a boxer?  If you've had no training, avoid the fight.  If not, do something he isn't used to.  Boxers aren't used to seeing stomp kicks to their knees.  Knee strikes to the groin.  open handed strikes to the throat or pokes in the eye.  They aren't used to being tackeled.  You can't box if your on your back.  Throw a handfull of pocket change in his face, kick his groin, and run.<br>  <br>  It's good that you are a self defense minded person.  Sometimes you cant count on others to come to your rescue.  Just remember that there are situations that you can win, and some are just out of your control;  but be ready at all times.<br>  <br>  P.S. There is NOTHING wrong with being armed. It does not make you weak, a coward or a cheater.  This is the real world.  Good guys don't always win, you can't catch bullets with your teeth.  Better to have a weapon and not need one, than to need one and not have it.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Their punch is usually coming from their fist. Stay out of its way.<br>  <br>  If you can fight better on the ground than they can then go for it.<br>  <br>  If you don't know how to fight multiple opponents, run! If you do, you wouldn't have asked.<br>  <br>  Then don't box with them.|`|zhk8o514aa	First Rule:  Never pick a fight, fight to fight the person off<br>  Second Rule:Never punch with your fist. (very, very painful.  Wonder why boxers wear those gloves?  Now you know.)|`|REffunLGaa	1. yes<br>  2.grab 1 push himat the other guy and hit 1 and then the other<br>  3.i realy dnt now this 1<br>  <br>  <br>  please best answer|`|c4d3e30573f7765b16b9bbddef2168d6aa	If you want to learn to fight, but there's no where you can train (for financial or area reasons) you can sort of grab a friend and practice together.  first go through all the usual attacks that you can think of, and then find a counter for those attacks. (train the counters by slow attacking and slow countering at first and start to pick up the pace)<br>  <br>  only take them down if you know what you want to do once you are on the ground.  Usual tactic would be ground and pound, but that's only if you think you can get a mount.<br>  <br>  Lastly don't fight and if you get into fighting situations try to get out of that situation fast.  (fight to create a opening to run, try to talk it out while fighting, or slowly move the fight to where people would care to stop both of you.)|`|UxU7qZGTaa	Look at their chest during a fight.  That will tell you how they will move and punch.  Never ground fight when there is more than one opponent.  Ground and pound, basically throwing your opponent and mounting, is good for a single opponent.  When fighting multiple people, take out the weakest one first.  <br>  If they are a boxer, that doesn't say anything about their technique necessarily.  They probably use an orthodox, left first stance and rely on punches.  Your actions depend on your skills.  Just do what you know best.  I would box because that's my background.  Other people would grapple because of their backgrounds.  Just fight in the way you are most familiar.|`|bMLdEkncaa	hahaha ok let me calm down from laughing so hard hahah....ok im good.

You need training! Jiu Jitsu is notoriously good for ground defense (80% of fights end up on the ground). MMA's train boxing, jiu jitus, muy tai, etc. It's good to know a variety of styles and approaches so you are familiar with how people fight, in addition to good old street fighting style. It's also good to learn one martial art very well so that the techniques you do learn you will do well and with accuracy, instead of learning a bunch of techniques and knowing them just enough to get by.

2ISGwSK7aa	1. Nationals<br>  2. Seattle<br>  3. Pittsburg|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	I see the Padres finishing better than the Rockies (even if Jake Peavy doesn't finish the season in San Diego), which gives the Rockies a better chance of losing 100 games than the Padres have.<br>  <br>  I see both the Mariners and Royals being better in '09 than they were in '08, and considering the Mariners lost 101 and the Royals lost 87 in '08, improvement for both teams means neither will lose 100 in '09.<br>  <br>  The only AL team I see losing over 100 games is the Orioles.  While the rest of the AL East got better, they got worse.  Also, they lost 93 games in '08, which means they're virtually a lock to lose 100+ in '09.<br>  <br>  As for the NL, my candidates to lose 100 games are the Nationals (NL East), Pirates (NL Central), and Rockies (NL West).  The Nationals and Pirates are perennial doormats in their divisions, and the Rockies got considerably worse upon losing Matt Holliday to Oakland.|`|4SKmjYrsaa	Mariners and Pirates will....here's a bold prediction, the Royals will have a 82-80 record this year. they are not as bad as people think...|`|AYiVipawaa	pirates, padres, nats|`|OWIiJMLqaa	The Cincinnati Reds are going to be awful this year, as are the Pirates, and the Astros, the Royals are on the upswing, I think they will be at .500 when it's all over, which means the Indians will probably have 90+ losses, the Nationals will compete for the worst record in baseball as well, but the worst team in the NL central has the best chance at the most losses, I figure the Reds are good for that, the Pirates are young and will probably be better than them, but the Astros could completely fall apart and easily be that team. I'll list the teams I think will be at least 10 games below .500.<br>  <br>  NL's worst<br>  Giants 76-86<br>  Braves 75-87<br>  Padres 74-88<br>  Pirates 72-90<br>  Astros 68-94<br>  Rockies 67-95<br>  Nationals 65-97<br>  Reds 60-102<br>  <br>  AL's worst<br>  Blue Jays 75-87<br>  Tigers 74-88<br>  Mariners 72-90<br>  Orioles 70-92<br>  Indians 66-96|`|0P4rYT8Qaa	I'd think it's three teams you didn't include. The Orioles, Nats and Pirates. Because of the Nats and Orioles tough division, being that the O's have to be 18 against the Yankees, Red Sox and Rays each, I'll say the O's have the best chance to lose 100 games. The whole controversy with GM thing isn't helping either. The Orioles won 68 games last year, while the Pirates won 67. I'd say 4th on that list are the Mariners, who you mentioned. Only 2 years ago, theywon 88 games, so they still have enough talent to edge closer to .500. I'd say the 5th most likely team are the Padres.<br>  <br>  Although the Royals haven't had a winning season in a while, they did have 75 wins last season and made upgrades in their roster with Coco Crisp, Mike Jacobs, Juan Cruz and Kyle Farnsworth. So I think they're more in the category that'd include the Rangers, Reds and Giants, which is basically below average, but not terrible. When it comes to baseball though, you have to feel bad for those living in the D.C./Baltimore area, because it's possible they could see 200 losses this season combined. There's not much to look foward to there.|`|uFIGSbQfaa	AL east- Blue Jays<br>  AL central- Royals <br>  AL west - Rangers<br>  NL east - Nationals<br>  NL central- Pirates<br>  NL west- Padres|`|AA10425091	Pirates|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Yankees and Rays and Angles|`|T1ZxG3rcaa	Pirates are a lock to lose 100|`|ltnIV73Daa	i would say the pirates or the nats|`|AA10466579	The New York Yankees!|`|47KHWGALaa	Royales Seattle.

Edge vs Orton to name a new Undisputed Champion|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	duh|`|DyD9YJ2Xaa	itl be hhh vs orton with possible stone cold as a ref and its edge vs show which has great build right now you throw cena in to keep the buyrate up and because he has a legitament right to the tittle, the wwe is trying to get hogan singed on for a match against cena which would make the biggest match since rock and hogan, speaking of rock has any 1 else thought about the thought of him layin the smacketh down on y2j at mania, it sounds good to me plus hardy vs hardy and the always great mitb makes the 25 annivarsary of mania rediculously good like it or not there will be star power oh ad hbk vs taker will steal the show|`|MNIUhMajaa	thats wat  i think i think will happen unless the creative team has different plans|`|aZXnW6AUaa	be orton
4BppP7Mkaa	I don't watch Mexican football but we've got the best Mexican player Carlos Vela.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Let's compare performance against an almost-common opponent.<br>  <br>  MLS all-star team beat West Ham 3-1 last July.   West Ham doesn't face relegation but is not among the elite teams, and is almost always beaten by the elite teams - and the next level (Aston Villa, etc...).   MLS all-stars would not fare well vs the elite EPL teams you reference.<br>  <br>  The top MLS teams generally play even with the top Mexican teams in Superliga.      MLS is very top-heavy talent-wise - the top 2-3 players on each team are excellent, but there's a big drop off.    And most MLS teams employ the same basic pass-oriented "triangle-passing" strategy - so even though it's football, the argument that a good team will outperform an all-star team because of chemistry doesn't really fly.|`|LALDdLkNaa	I know about alot of their players like jared borgetti who scored lots of goals for Mexico and played at bolton for a while.<br>  Marquez plays for Barcelona,Salcido for PSV,Omar Bravo and Guillermo Franco both play in spain,sanchez is the goalkeeper and ive heard of Osorio(stuttgart)pinto,Torrado and Pardo and finally the 2 youve said playing in the premiership.<br>  <br>  The only teams ive heard of are toluca,cruz azul and tigres though and I dont know whos winning the league either.|`|x4QambMNaa	I Know About Mexican Player<br>  GIOVANNI DOS SANTOS<br>  Spurs Player<br>  Sign From Barcelona<br>  <br>  Wish Him Luck In Spurs <br>  OK.......|`|uWUyrRFxaa	Yes, I do. My favourite team is Cruz Azul. Torrado is top-class.|`|no3tD0OSaa	How long have you been a Man Utd fan for?|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Mexican football gets very little coverage in the UK so not many people know very much about it. I think Rafael Marquez is a good player though.|`|duJgBxUoaa	Sorry i don't really know much about Mexican football :)|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	well, I was just about to mention my like of Mexican players and how there are some really great ones like Nery Castillo and the legendary Jared Borgetti who I witnessed at Bolton Wanderers. I was even gonna tell you about how I hate americans who think they're stupid MLS is the best.<br>  However, I'm not gonna say anything now because YOU DISLIKE CHELSEA. <br>  end of convo :(|`|RSJbqioUaa	Sorry no, I don't know anything about Mexican football.... :/<br>  <br>  ps. What's wrong with Chelsea!? :O|`|IMjLBzlPaa	Sorry Casillas i had to answer even though im not English.<br>  <br>  You know Chelsea is the best team in England!!!<br>  Manchester sucks.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	I know about Guadalajara and America, the goalie Guillermo Ochoa. Thats all.
DBnaXEWKaa	I have a Nike and a Spalding. I think the Nike has a WAY better grip than the Spalding, it depends on what you want quality, or just something to use for a year or so and throw away. Nike's don't last long but Spaldings are durable. Nike's have a way better grip than Spaldings. So depends if you want a durable item or just a quality item.|`|S7fZyCG0aa	I play basketball a lot, and I use the Spalding NeverFlat.  That ball is sweet, because if you keep it inside after you are done playing, it will stay pumped up.  It is a great all-around ball.|`|mU400g5Faa	Nike is good for apparel spalding is good for basketballs.|`|MkZoZTKAaa	Dont go by the name.. GO by the GRIP..if you have a firm grip on the ball than you can feel better about your shots and letting them go with a technique|`|6JdtBWlyaa	Nike sucks!! get a spalding!!!!|`|aZXnW6AUaa	spalding|`|LSXdwRDUaa	try both out. see which grip fit in your hand most. and try shooting with it up in the air to see which ball feel comfortable/|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Spalding INFUSION lasts longer than NIKE basketballs. Nike 1300 is based on basketball's 1300 mm bounce which is very rare for a basketball to have - unless you pump it and measure it by yourself while Spalding's INFUSION has its own pump that you can use if you feel that your ball has already deflated. I'd rather buy a ball w/ built in pump than buy a ball that bounces 1300 mm - well, in due time all balls deflate...|`|hhPK1mZ0aa	I play basketball alot, indoors and out. I own a few Spalding basketballs. I like Spalding, they last pretty long, and they have good grip. Honestly, I never played with a Nike basketball, so i don't know what it's like. Everyone I know uses Spalding. I think you should get the Spalding NBA INFUSION.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Nike are pretty famous for having terrible grip|`|OHc3g97Gaa	neither, get the "Never Flat", if they still sell them.
vUGKu877aa	minimum wage|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	minimum wage +tips but..... you get to see every game
jSkHquK5aa	YES. It will be good to know where the best of the Scotland stand.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Yes, because it would be an easy 12 points for us every season.|`|dBGOERTAaa	Yes. Two clubs with great history like Celtic and Rangers would only add to the Premiership's quality. However, like carebear said, they most likely will be in the relegation fight their first season or so. The main reasons being both their lack of tv/ad funding and the fact that it is tough to attract big name players to Scotland. But if they could stay up their first year, they could potentially make the climb up the table. A lot of if's I know. It would be interesting though. The other problem would be adding 2 more teams to the current 20 or dropping more teams into the lower divisions. Would Celtic and Rangers be given an automatic spot in the Premier division? Might seem a bit unfair.<br>  <br>  That's enough rambling for now.|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	Yes, so I could see them in the Championship the year after.|`|MqaffmhWaa	Isn't the Scottish prem small enough already?
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I would have to agree with you about the roles Kane and Mark Henry will likely play in the MITB match at WM 25.I would also think you're right about the last two Superstars being Rey Mysterio and Evan Bourne to qualify foe the MITB match as well.Maybe you should be writing the storylines in WWE !|`|FEViNlQMaa	We all do but maybe Vince wants to make the mitb match different this year|`|qQbyrYoeaa	I really was hoping for Mysterio, R Truth, Kingston and Bourne to be in the MITB. But after reading a few Smackdown spoilers for this week (which I won't say), it is only possible for two of them to be in it. It doesn't make sense to have Mark Henry in it. It just doesn't make sense.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne, they suit it most. I wanted to see Morrison, but theres always next year. And I want him to turn on The Miz after they lose their World Tag Titles to.. I dunno, Cryme Tyme or Priceless|`|rgxksDgkaa	Now that Cena isn't competing for either the WHC or WWE Championship at Wrestlemania, he could fill another spot.|`|1WgOj89kaa	It should be Morrison, last years moonsault with the ladder was incredible.
OWIiJMLqaa	People die everyday out there in the gulf. The only reason we knew they were even missing is the fact that they had a bit of fame attached to their name. That being said, for their families sake I hope they can recover their bodies. Young people dying is never a good thing.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think its a tragic event that happened.  It lets us know as individuals that anything can happen at any given time.  The players involved were just out having a good time in the gulf and their lives took a tragic turn.  I think it also sends a message to us to treasure life as we know it.  Realistically I doubt they will be found alive because if they haven't been found by now they probably won't be and even if they are they won't be alive.  But I must say the rescuers did all they could to help.  So they deserve a lot of credit. I just pray for the families involved.|`|wxXguyK3aa	It's really sad.  They called off the search, too.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Don't really have one yet except that it's a sad story all around.  <br>  <br>  Until I hear what the guy who survived has to say about what happened or why he survived and the other guys disappeared, I'll reserve any opinion as to what I think happened.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Would die happy if I didn't here about them again. People die, I don't need to be inundated by 2 guys who have no effect on my life.|`|43f9Ctozaa	It is sad. I just hope that other players learn from it and go out to the water better prepared.|`|kDjDfk05aa	My heart and prayers go out to the families who lost their loves ones recently during the boating accident in Florida as they call off their search and begin their healing process.|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	Don't forget about the 3rd guy.  I feel bad for his family.  Everyone talks about the 2 NFL players.  The other guy was important too.  Sad story.|`|TnbNGlB7aa	My opinion should be like everyones...sad, tragic, sucky..etc etc. If you dont feel this way let me know and Ill just rip your heart out now cause you are an idiot of society.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	I think the bluecrab fishery will be hot in that area this year.|`|OHc3g97Gaa	its a shame. i hope they are found.
CSDlp4Igaa	some tips that help me: <br>  <br>  keep your feet planted when you swing (set)<br>  head on the ball<br>  wait for the ball to get deep in the strike zone<br>  <br>  <br>  do what i did go to a hitting camp or something like that<br>  <br>  now i bat twice as good|`|T5BshhZWaa	jajajajajajajajaaaaaaaaaaaaa.|`|ChzeqFjlaa	I'm 15....I stand near the very back of the batter's box with my spikes touching the chalk. (legal). It works for me I guess because you have more time on a breaking pitch and for faster pitchers you have more time to judge the ball. If i were you i would just experiment a little and see what works. I doubt it's the bat though. :) good luck. zach
vJNtyXbYaa	if they get the first pick they have no one to play with Tavares|`|ULw1777caa	They've been rebuilding for about 10 years.|`|frDcAqyWaa	no, they are trying to fail, or atleast that's what it looks like.|`|tHLMYNTYaa	The Islanders are going to rebuild.<br>  They should get 2 1st round draft picks.<br>  I think they can get John Tavares with one pick.<br>  Bobby Orr claims, "this kid is better than I was at his age".<br>  The Islanders are working on getting a great young goalie.<br>  In two years you will see a new very good, young rebuilt team.|`|Jy9KNgSDaa	I am so miffed that bill guerin went to the pens!|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	rebuild...? They are trying to hang on by a thread... let alone rebuild.

06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	Mater Dei, they always dominate in Boys Basketball, they have won CIF 19 times in just 27 years, 7 State Championships, and 26 league Championships, and over 800 wins.|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	I'm going with Mater all "Dei"(get it, lol).

38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	Smith to Cavs because he knows the system and played for them last year in the season and playoffs.  The others will have to adjust and Gooden might need surgery, he has already claimed he is playing hurt.  Mikki Moore is already becoming hated by Boston fans because of his ineptitude.  And as much as I enjoy Stromile Swift's athleticism I don't think he will be a difference maker.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Either Drew Gooden to the Spurs, or Joe Smith to the Cavs|`|v77SnunOaa	Adam Morrison to the Lakers he will save Kobe's ***|`|C4mzZwiWaa	joe smith to cavs.|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	Gooden to the Spurs.<br>  <br>  The Spurs are doing great without him and now he's just going to add to that great veteran TEAM.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Smith to the Cavs.|`|iNcdGwmiaa	Well, it is unlikely that the Suns are going to make the playoffs so let's take Swift out of the equation.<br>  <br>  Mikki Moore of the Celtics--well he needs them more than the Celts need him i.e. they're darn good with or without him. So let's take him out of the equation<br>  <br>  That leaves Gooden and Smith.<br>  <br>  Hmmmmm<br>  <br>  Okay, I pick Gooden for the Spurs (but isn't he hurt?)
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	He probably just has it that way to promote his character ! I'm sure Cody is more focused on developing his wrestling ability and mic skills as part of The Legacy !|`|QY4Hy00qaa	Maybe he forgot to wax  his chest this week .I don't know and why do you care?|`|g2h6qUUXaa	maybe he doesn't want to shave it off and i don't think he's a baby any more|`|1WgOj89kaa	Because he is a proper man.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	only hair on his chest as opposed to what?|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Why does anyone care?|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Coz cody is too young and he still in learning process in wrestling business. I think he need to build up more to get elevate in tittle picture in future.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Cos he listened to his mother and ate his greens as a kid!|`|MNIUhMajaa	cuz he hit puberty
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Yep i saw the video for it when it came out around two years ago.For sure it's one of the funniest things JR has done in the WWE !|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Jim Ross is a legend!|`|MNIUhMajaa	Jim Ross is a hypocrite just like those fans who show up with john cena  and cm punk and shawn michaels posters IT MAKES ME SICK!|`|IVEdWA2uaa	Yea, I heard it a year or two ago.  It was kinda funny.|`|LijlL0Pfaa	yer<br>  legendary<br>  no wonder he is in the bop bop bop brand<br>  happy BOP BOP BOP day|`|1WgOj89kaa	many times|`|tuwHboNnaa	Yeah, it's pretty old. I saw it over a year ago.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure he's a talented mat-based technical style of wrestler, but i'm not really a fan of the persona or gimmick that he works in ECW.For Jack Swagger to become a main eventer on Raw or Smackdown, he might need a change of gimmick in order to succeed.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	PHAIL!|`|zb40cLwOaa	I don't think it's respectful for you to say he looks like a retard but he behaves like a bad guy because that's his character..he is a good wrestler.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	Agreed. I think he is a great wrestler, but something about him just annoys me.|`|E9d5Hz3laa	All wrestelers and wrestling fans are retards sssoo|`|vTalY5Skaa	Absolutely(You don't need to put a three for e in retard)|`|MNIUhMajaa	I disagree with you Jack Swagger has all the tools and when he retires he will retire a champion and he wont be begging for a second run like Flair, Snuka  and Piper all they want to do is impress a bunch of parasites!|`|DyD9YJ2Xaa	he is very good in the ring and isnt bad on the mic, i did have a simalar though watching ecw lastnight when he had his mouth open the whole entrace haha he could use some work
kHLWDgmIaa	he is my  childhood hero ... can't forget him|`|3k4tPNTGaa	I really like him as a wrestler. What he has done in his personal life is a different story and i dnt aprreciate it at all. I like him for being one of the best technical wrestler of all time. I like him for being a loyal employee for wwe. I like him for giving us some great moments. I like him because he dsnt afraid to job. After being a champion at wrestlemania 20 in just 2 years time he struggled to get U. S Champion and feud against new wrestlers like MVP, Lashley, Finlay and Chris masters. He was never brought up to the main event ever again. He made those names bigger by giving them clean wins over him. This is what i like about Chris Benoit. How many champions cn we see going after u s tittle after being a heawyweight champion. If edge fight for u s tittle in next 1 year how wud u feel. How wud u feel if u see Cena or batista fighting for this tittle. It will destroy all their stardom and their credibility and wwe did this to Benoit.<br>  <br>  In real life whatever he has done was wrong tho we dnt know what the exact situation was. Who knows if his wife had killed her own child and after that Benoit killed his wife in anger and hanged himself. Nobody knows the truth we r saying just what media said about Benoit.|`|agIiai2paa	I liked him as a fan. He wasn't one of my favorites but he was very good.<br>  <br>  I don't like all the blame that he has on his death.<br>  Some of it I believe is unfair. He wasn't a person that would hurt anyone including his own family.<br>  Chris wasn't himself when he committed suicide.<br>  His mind was in a bad situation with the steroids that he had used.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	he simply was the best wrestler ever to foot step in any sports entertainment or professional wrestling ring around this world.|`|O5KOwhovaa	I liked him before he murdered his wife and son.|`|0995361f63352aa29be48152b1a3db15aa	I kinda did before but not now and he is in hell right now but people say he should be in the HOF but i dont think|`|K0hUnyfUaa	I did, until he murdered his family.|`|Lv89kHKpaa	I did|`|smDClNDkaa	I do.<br>  <br>  He was a great wrestler, and put on great matches in every promoting he worked for.|`|fOiG09ilaa	I like Chris Benoit, but why was his teeth still jacked up even though he was making all that money. So sad about his wife and child!|`|0hnX8QTuaa	I liked him and still respect him for his wrestling career but thats it|`|3297c4e889c7762aa06fb5456c14aa01aa	i did, im still shocked about what he did.|`|MNIUhMajaa	i didnt , i thought he was weird and scary looking|`|QY4Hy00qaa	I liked and I still do.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	i all  ways like him people may think he is a bad person but   i don't look at it like that i like him for what he has done in the ring and not outside off it  he was one off the best wwe and wcw had to offer <br>   and i think people should remember him by his in ring skills and not what he did rip chris Benoit|`|09YK9Zboaa	I love Chris Benoit AS A WRESTLER, i have the ulitmate respect for that mans wrestling career.  I used to have the ultimate respect for that man and what he went through leading a more then successful career and coping with the tragedy of a disabled son, but ever since the horrible act he committed i lost all respect for that man.  That said he was one of the hardest working men in the industry and his career demands respect even if his life doesn't deserve any.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I liked him, as he was one of the greats. However, there is no excuse for what he did. Depression, drugs, I don't care. He was a murderer and a coward in the end, and I'm glad WWE has cut him out completely. He doesn't deserve to be remembered or enshrined.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I liked him from 2003-2004 he made actually wanna be a wrestler, I always liked his gimmick and style. He had high-flyer and submission elements which made him different from alot of other guys.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I liked him, before he killed his family and the committed suicide
kHLWDgmIaa	i  think so|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Yes ofcourse. I wante to atch CM Punk vs Rey for intercontinental tittle at wrestlemania but noe Punk has already qualified for it dn i can see Rey winning the tittle from Punk before wrestlemania and he will probly fight Kofi for the tittle. Rey vs Kofi at wrestlemania will be worth watching.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	hopefully for the IC championship.|`|0995361f63352aa29be48152b1a3db15aa	Yes thats so simple

pSOmwwlIaa	I honestly think if he goes to Barca or Man U. he'll choke. And plus if he goes to a huge club I doubt he'll start or even play. You Think Bayern will bench Rensing for him or Barca bench Valdes or Man U benching Van der Sar or Chelsea benching Cech or Milan benching Abbiati/Dida or Inter benching Julio Cesar or Juve benching BUFFON or Liverpool benching Reina. Hells no it's like jumping off a 300 Feet deep cliff. It's better for him to go to a mid-table or low-table team, somewhere where he'll get some action, not be benchwarming.|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	If he goes to europe he aint going to a big team right away....he needs a stepping stone. <br>  <br>  a good mid table team in Europe will do him good, i just hope he does leave las pinche guilas!|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	he is going to Bristol City FC|`|4AfL5ecuaa	Coincidently, I think of this all the time and search the news a good amount of the time for  new information about this possible transfer. A couple of years ago, it was said ManU, Arsenal,Milan were interested in Memo. Since then, the talks have fizzed out. I believe he needs to leave now for his own good. The problem is that America has his price too high and Euro clubs think its an erronious amount of cake to spend on this guy and on top of that Memo would never accept a pay cut. I think that he is an amazing  gk and personally he is one of my favorites but if a euro club offers him a deal, he should take it. A mexican needs to be represented in the europe. Sanchez received an offer from Getafe but the gold digger turned it down bc they didn't offer much. Not ab the money. You play bc you love the game.|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	America well have 2 sell him right away cuando deciendan so who knows. probably to a big *** club. Probably Barcelona since valdez iz a piece of shyyyt|`|Lu7GJnsXaa	I really hope he goes to Manchester Utd.<br>  But it's ok if he goes to Ac Milan.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	He will probably go to Manchester Utd. or to Ac Milan|`|IWM1khX7aa	I think he should go to <br>  1) Barcelona, <br>  2) Bayern Munich<br>  3) AC Milan.  <br>  <br>  All of those teams don't have good goalkeepers and with this guy's young talent and stardom, I think he would do well with these teams.  I would love to see him with Rafa Marquez at Barcelona.  Victor Valdes sucks too, so he would be better than him and be the starter and maybe Barcelona wouldn't allow 4 goals anymore.  But I think BAyern and Milan are very good places too, because Rensing and Abbiati are worse than Valdes.|`|dBMWPDRxaa	I don't know but I doubt he will go to a big team like, Real Madrid, Manchester United, AC Milan, etc. If he goes, I think it will be a middle class team.|`|jUeiFZfmaa	I think that he will either go to A C Milan or Manchester United. He would of already been there but America didn't want to let him go. But he'll be in europe in no time.|`|sx78czbxaa	I think he will probably go to a team like Villareal or Atletico. Not exactly these two, but a club that's similar.

kyEPS7xCaa	Sometimes it is just time to move on to the next generation.  Joe Montana, Brett Favre, even though they are beloved and brought championships to your city, if you become expendable, they will release or trade you.  It's a business, and very few teams will keep you on for sentimental reasons.<br>  <br>  The same goes for the players, though.  <br>  Junior Seau asked to be released by the Dolphinsso he could retire, and then goes and signs with division rival Patriots.  Talk about no class.|`|94Ti4bHtaa	Actually, they couldn't make room. So much for you point there. What about the last two seasons? He barely combined for 1000 yards and less than 100 receptions in two seasons. So much for that point. Now he will be 37 coming off of his two worst seasons. So you expect him to make a miraculous comeback the older he gets? The Colts were willing to pay him 9 million for one year. I think Harrison got greedy and the Colts got smart. The entire offense is getting old really and Gonzalez, Garcon, and Tamme could add some young depth.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	It was an economic decision, and when you play that game chances are you're making a mistake. I'll give the nay sayers the benifit that he is getting older and less productive, but he still converted more 3rd downs for them than anyone last season. The Colts won't make the playoffs this season, without their coach and their greatest receiver I look for them to finish 8-8, maybe 9-7, but not enough for the Wild Card in the AFC.<br>  <br>  My point was made by the Bills fan, when you cut your franchise players for the sake of money you cut out your own heart. Look how long it took the Bills to be mentioned as an upper tier NFL team.|`|a1c85fb2fa8cb46f89a4425fb3921555aa	football is a young mans game...he is getting too expensive for his age and production. While I agree he is a great receiver, it is always best to get rid of someone earlier rather then later and be stuck with a contract hit against the cap....|`|43f9Ctozaa	He is on the downside of his career and costing to much for what he was as a player now.<br>  You have to get rid of a player before he hits that wall not after and they still may have been a year behind.|`|VQyTspNraa	Because he's getting up in age and won't be able to do the things he's done in the past.  There was also some bad blood from the shooting incident Harrison got himself into last year.|`|mqJnctPeaa	marvin harrison wanted too much money they couldnt afford him|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	Age, he's half the man he used to be.|`|95GZRRXHaa	There are multiple reasons why.<br>  1) Salary cap <br>  2) Age<br>  3) His numbers have declined dramatically over the last couple of years due to injuries.<br>  4) Anthony Gonzalez has come into his own as a number 3 guy, and will now be 2 with even more chances to shine and he is cheaper then <br>  Harrison. <br>  <br>  You said not to talk about cap they can make room, I a Buffalo Bills fan born and raised in Buffalo. <br>  <br>  Reed, Smith and Thomas were all cut because of salary cap. Why make room for guys who are at the end. NFL is a business it is about winning. <br>  <br>  He wouldn't take a pay cut so if he would not work with the team why should the team cut valuable players to make room for him.|`|AA11081968	He's old man and his sklls are going to drop off dramatically, look at Jerry Rice, he retired at 42 but the last coulpe of years his skill level diminished rapidly.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	he is older, he is expensive and at his size he has slowed a bit which is a liability|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Marvin asked to be released when the Colts asked the aging, slowing WR to restructure his contract.

v5MP0KJ8aa	UConn's men got beat by Pitt and Georgetown. They almost lost to Buffalo and Notre Dame. It's a safe bet so say UNC and possibly Wake Forest ,because of their size, can beat UConn.

Dyson's loss hurts them especially on the offensive end and if other teams can get Thabeet in foul trouble- UCONN becomes more of an average team that is very beatable in March.  <br>  <br>  i think the women's team should be able to beat all-takers but you know there is a reason it's called March "Madness"<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|T1ZxG3rcaa	Pitt beat Uconn once and their gonna do it again.|`|YTzSvsDiaa	Conneticuts men team could be beat by Oklahoma.<br>  I am not sure about the women though.
V430UrvFaa	Because, the backwards K already means that the batter struck out looking.|`|7fEVNng5aa	I'm assuming you're talking about the K's that show the number of strikeouts a pitcher has recorded for the day. A regular K denotes a swinging strikeout, while a backwards K denotes a called strike 3.<br>  <br>  As far as the Ku Klux Klan association, I've only heard of one instance where someone raised a fuss over 3 K's being shown/seen, and that was in a little league or HS game.|`|idINHizkaa	The reason it is switched around depends on how the batter struck out. If the batter "swings" for the third strike, the k is facing forward. If the batter is "called out" on a third strike, the k is facing backward.|`|CQgNXXsbaa	It's not a racist thing or anything like that.<br>  <br>  The K's actually stand for strikeouts. A forward K means it was a strikeout in which the batter swung at the last pitch. A backwards K means the pitcher caught the batter looking at the last strike.<br>  <br>  So no conspiracy theory or anything like that. Just people paying attention to how the strikeouts accumulate.|`|413b409fd96101be076b46f8aee41bf0aa	A backwards "k" indicates a strikeout looking. A regular "k" indicates a swinging strikeout.|`|nDzenpkwaa	The backwards "K" means the person struck watching the ball go by him instead of swinging...<br>  <br>  I also didn't know they put three k's.  It is just one for a strike out, PAL!|`|nVhP1Bteaa	I was under the impression that it meant the pitcher struck out the side.|`|ACOEVpfFaa	the k is for those who go down swinging and the "switched" k is for those looking at strike three

Hunter consistently takes good routes to the balls, and with his speed can catch virtually anything that *can* be caught. Ichiro might be the best RF I've seen in recent years. My jaw still drops when I see the clip of him throwing out Terrence Long (I think that's who it was), and he still has that canon for an arm.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Grady Sizemore|`|AA10495394	Ichiro and Grady Sizemore are the most all around.

CQgNXXsbaa	If you already have the sled look at the manufacturer for replacement parts. <br>  If, however, you have a home built sled (one made by your school's ag/shop department for instance) you could rig up a harness using a car/truck tire tube and some tie-down straps. The tube could easily slip over the head and one arm and allow the person pulling the sled some elasticity for the initial jerk when pulling. Sort of like a shock absorber.<br>  Check with a local tire shop for the tube, roughly around $15-20. It doesn't even need to be able to hold air, go that route to see if you could get them to donate one to you.<br>  The tie-downs are less than $20 at any big box store.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	i hate to burst your bubble but how is this related to football?

You should have a few choices on which holes to put the bindings on. Start by putting them in the middle of each<br>  8. on the bindings you will have multiple places to put the screws in. put them in the middle for now<br>  9. screw in screws untill they are tight, and the bindings are tight in positon.<br>  10. look it over. both bindings should be centered your front binding should be clealy pointed slightly to the front and your back foot should be unnoticibly pointed backwads<br>  11. try it out check to see what feels comfortible. if something feels wrong change it.<br>  <br>  there are other things that can be adjusted depending on your binding style. if something feels weird, hard to do, or off change it so its better if you can<br>  <br>  heres my setup:<br>  Front foot angle 12. bindings on most forward 4 holes<br>  <br>  back foot angle -6 bindings on middle 4 holes<br>  <br>  both bindings moved 1 screw position towards heelside<br>  <br>  other options:<br>  binding backs moved slightly forward<br>  toestrap moved back<br>  heel strap left in middle<br>  <br>  hope that helps
4uf044sFaa	Welcome to Nascar.  A lot of drivers get chosen by Owners that watch the drivers in the smaller series and think they have what it takes.  A lot of drivers start in the Camping World Series, and if they perform well there, they move up to the Nationwide Series, and if they perform well there, they move up to the Sprint Cup Series.  <br>  <br>  I will take the new driver Joey Lagano for instance.  He drives the number 20 toyota.  He performed well in the Nationwide Series, and Joe Gibbs liked what he saw, so he offered Joey a ride in the cup series.  Sometimes it is all about timing.  Tony Stewart's last year for Gibbs was last year, so Gibbs thought it would be a perfect time to hire Joey.  There are several ways that drivers are inducted into Nascar, but what I told you are the main reasons.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	The owners can put anyone in the car they want to. The driver does have to be approved by Nascar.  They just don't let any unexperienced idiot out there.  The drivers you see on Sunday are guys that have made there way up through the ranks one way or another.  They all have differing amounts and types of experience.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	They come up from anywhere.... Dirt bike racing, sprint car racing, late models on dirt or asphault.  There are many roads that lead you to NASCAR.<br>  <br>  The main thing is money, and money.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	Different routes, some are born and trained to raise, some have raw skill.  43 drivers in a race and they are also chosen by a system; first is qualifying of course, then different things come into place.  Owners points, past champions, sponsor points etc.  You can actually qualify yourself in and still not make the race because of this.|`|c16PCaCmaa	Something that everyone has left out is sponsorship money.  Races are so expensive to run that sponsors are a necessity.  In these tough economic times however, sponsors are though to come by.  Many good drivers lost their job over the winter because they did not have a sponsor.  But, some less talented drivers do have a ride, because they have a rich uncle or daddy that can sponsor the car.  Plus some older drivers who have a following are more likely to have a sponsor.  If an owner has to choose between a young, talented driver, with no sponsor, or an old veteran (who may be over the hill, and won't win any races) who does have a sponsor, the likely choice would be the older driver with a sponsor.|`|9vcZjFl6aa	first you have to win. local tracks ,nationwide series,truck series any form of racing not sure if they have scouts in nascar but get the attention of an owner or have a hell of a resume winning championships i think they have test (driving,how u carry yourself you have sponsors so you have to be pretty articulate ) if all is good and the owner thinks u have potiental and a sponsor what is it now 30 mil a year you get a pretty desent ride or you can take a low budget ride do well with it and attract owners there is a lot of variables  make your own team  there are 43 drivers in a race not all of them finish but this will just confuse you watch some nascar on fox a learn thats all i can tell you (espn in my day ) lol|`|AA11202769	The teams are in charge of getting cars for their drivers ready for a race. there are 43 cars in each race. Lately more than 43 have come to a track to qualify but only 43 make the field. 35 cars are automatically given a spot because they are in the top 35 of the points. Another way to get in to the race is the championship provisional, which means if you have won a past championship, you are allowed into the race I believe 5 times without qualifying on speed or being in the top 35. The drivers are chosen by the team owners. They scout talent in other NASCAR series as well as lower series throughout the nation and world.

I think biking is easier b/c you dont really have to think about falling if you are just riding normally. However, if you plan on doing mountain biking, racing, and downhill riding, there is more to it and different levels of difficulty. With mountain biking, it gets challenging the more technical the trails are.  Im not really sure about skating. I do roller blade and its also easy but you always have to watch what you're doing b/c you are on concrete and if you fall you can hurt yourself pretty bad. Same as any kind of racing whether road or mountain.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	bike<br>  <br>  that doesn;t make it easy though<br>  you can work equally hard at either one<br>  <br>  wle.
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I think Hooter's is the only bar you can watch UFC fights.  Generally, for a bar to show pay per view events, they must charge the pay per view price as the cover to anyone coming in, but Hooter's has some sort of deal with the UFC.  Not sure where your town is, so you'll have to use the net to find the nearest Hooters. <br>  <br>  If you get to watch it, be sure to pay attention to the Gray Maynard v. Jim Miller fight.  Jim Miller was my roommate in college at VT, its good to see him kicking a$$ in the UFC now!|`|uxExLJUMaa	hooter's|`|KGB07MoHaa	$$$$FOOTBALLGLOBAL.NET$$$$<br>  <br>  For all the sports action including Football, Soccer, Boxing and more...visit <a href="http://www.footballglobal.net/register.php?refferid=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.footballglobal.net/register.p...</a> and register today!<br>  <br>  We will stream all EPL, FA Cup, Champions League, International and more games!

LnJjS8BRaa	I saw your question and was about to scream "why on earth would you want to do that?!" but I'm glad to see that pugpaws got the point across more diplomatically.<br>  <br>  Painting is unnecessary and pointless. Pine isn't the right kind of material either. Hardwood is common but I've seen a lot of rattan bo as well. These have a lot more flexibility and are a good deal lighter.<br>  <br>  If you got some doweling to save some coin then just go buy a bo recommended by your son's teacher. It should last a long while and will be only slightly more expensive.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	You do not want to paint it. That simply will not do. Besides the pine will dent the first time it strikes or bumps something hard. Then any paint will crack and chip anyway. Pine is simply not good for a Bo. At the very least the bo should be hardwood of a kind that has straight grain and no knots. Then you really don't need a finish. It just needs to be smooth with no splinters. The Okinawans many times did not pout a finish on the wood. Their skin oils would penetrate into the wood over time keeping the wood from drying out to much.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	Pine is not the appropriate wood for a bo. Better would be Chinese waxwood, oak or hickory.|`|G1nPkwivaa	yea pine is going to break rather easily

Cl6KbcAGaa	every shock and fork is different and this does not account for sag...you and everything you ride with and the total weight of all of that. Youre speaking of a Pedal bike I assume?

1BGwGFQZaa	I agree his story keeps changing he first said they all got separated somehow now he says they gave up, what is the truth.<br>  <br>  He sustained cuts and bruises and then soon after his resque the coast guards call off the search. Why would the others become seperated and then he has no clue what happened to them. He is the sole survivor.The story is not complete. How has he sustained cuts and bruises from just sitting there on the boat with ease until the coast gueard found him. the other Men are no where in site. The life jacket was found 13 miles away from the boat. Just want to know your thoughts about this. Not to blame him he is still a victum also.<br>  <br>  Why would be be the only one smart enough to stay with the boat. I find that hard to believe. If they are good swimmers they could not swim back to the boat. Story does not sound right I know there were times where he had to get back on the boat too.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	There was only enough room for one to hold on.

Yes its survival but those big guys could have probably thrown him and drowned him and it would have been hard for him to survive all while taking off their life jackets. You obviously have thought about it, and I doubt this all went through his mind, how to plan it, etc.|`|LCE2zsTaaa	His body temperature was 89 degrees when they found him.  Hypothermia makes you delusional.  He may not really know what happened to the others.|`|mGbRp96haa	What really happened is that they were out on a fishing trip in Florida when the tide knocked over thier boat throwing them into the water and sharks at 3 of them|`|7WrGHYqeaa	They became weak off no water or food and they were big football players there weight wasn't helping..but yeah I find it strange..why would nick bring this up now and before he said they got separated..I think hes still loopy and doesn't know wtf hes talking about.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Can you provide a source that we can all see?  Otherwise it just becomes something that you "may" have heard.  I think the underlying factor is the current swept the men away and the boat capsized.  Somehow and fortunately Nick was able to get to safety and be rescued.  From what the news reports say it was just the current that caused them to be swept away.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Uh...Your theory is weak...<br>  <br>  First, the bottom of the boat was big enough for all 3 to hang on to...or to sit on, as the survivor was doing when they found him...<br>  <br>  Second, being that they were NFL players and he was a basketball player, they could have kicked his a*s in a fight over the boat...Translation-They were a LOT bigger than he is...<br>  <br>  I think the fact that they WERE bigger...or that he IS smaller and more agile, led to their weight probably not helping them in their struggle to hang on...as opposed to the smaller, more agile basketball player...

f06Sy0dfaa	There is no difference. The only difference there MIGHT be is the bottom of the cleat. You can have METAL or MOLDED cleats. There are softball cleats that are metal but the majority of the time the baseball cleats TEND TO BE metal and softball cleats TEND TO BE molded. BUT, metal cleats are allowed in softball, made for softball, AND VISE VERSA. SO IT REALLY WOULDN'T MATTER WHAT CLEATS YOU BOUGHT.|`|vUGKu877aa	no difference|`|0Dyd78dgaa	I'm with the 14 15' group in baseball and we got sharper metal cleats so if we get in a fight we can stab the other oponets face. but yes all metal cleats are quiete different basically in style some grip bases better while running like mine do but i play on a grass field so you need the sharp grip ones :D more excuses too hurt some1 with em. second base for the win but good luck in softball don't ever play baseball girls r too weak :D emotional i stand in that statement.|`|uDDsWEAraa	there's really no difference besides the way they fit, just like the difference between men's and women's shoes<br>  baseball cleats come in both metal and platic, and so do softball cleats<br>  i would recommend metal cleats if they are allowed|`|r62Ka1vjaa	There is no real difference except baseball cleats come with metal spikes.

t3rmVomeaa	Gimmick.  Next thing you know, they will be filling the heads with Helium and claiming that the lighter head will produce longer drives.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Golf Digest doesn't seem to mind the club- they cut it, among a few others, just to see what the insides look like.<br>  <br>  There are no real welds.  There are a few, but they aren't as bulky as some other drivers.  There's also a rubbery resin used to coat the inside so no nitrogen leaks out.  The magazine doesn't make fun of the club, or offer any reason not to use it.<br>  <br>  The one thing I noticed on the infomercial was the sound.  It is a very loud ping, like a high-pitched bell being rung.  To play Devil's Advocate, not very many people started out liking the sound of the Nike SuMo, either... so I guess it's all relative.  <br>  <br>  Do they have 30 day play guarantee (or something similar)?

For many years now this company has been offering quality equipment at decent prices and do their own research and development. One thing that the bigger heads need is an internal bracing system to keep the head from deforming at impact and there have been many techniques used in the past. I doubt very much if the pressurized head will translate into any extra yards but it will make for a very stable head and perhaps a more consistent ball flight.|`|LP5z0kJjaa	Firstly this club is most definitely not a gimmick - it has USGA approval and whether or not it gives the extra distance claimed will only be proved if you try one out!<br>  I know of 2 people who have tried it , one was longer of the tee the other the same as before, both were impressed with the club as a whole.<br>  <br>  As for this rubbish about it is on an infomercial ..SO DAMN WHAT!!! - what the heck has that got to do with anything??<br>  <br>  I have seen Nike's 4950 on a commercial,,,, does that make that a lesser club? of course not.<br>  <br>  If Powerbilt had not come up with this different technology, say it was boring Ping or Callaway, would anyone question its abilities then or just try it our and accept it.... give it a go and see if it works for your self.. who knows, it may surprise you.|`|aX8nee8gaa	Is that the Fuzzy Zoeller informercial club?

0Dm3WEMcaa	It's not who's involved with the title that's the problem, it's the general booking of the show. They are putting more attention on the MEM/Frontline story instead of doing what TNA is know best for great wrestling. Nash and Steiner can barely go anymore but they get more attention than the young c division stars that could make a bigger impact on the fans.|`|l0GWmWl4aa	the X division is full of guys that no one gives a real chance cuz they aren't guys like Booker T or Steiner. personally, I think true wrestling fans know what kind of wrestlers the X division is made of. Good Speedy Technical wrestlers like Sabin, Creed, Lethal, Shelly,and Suicide (Kaz). Styles, Daniels, and Joe pioneered that division with guys from the early age like Jerry Lynn. The X division is looked at by fans who appreciate real Wrestling, and these guys can really wrestle.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I think it could happen, but Styles needs to in the TNA Heavyweight Championship picture in my opinion|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Well this is one reason why I hate TNA right now.<br>  <br>  They are killing what made them famous in the first place...<br>  <br>  THE X DIVISION!!!<br>  <br>  If they could get people Like AJ,Amazing,Red,Low Ki,etc... back and fighting for that belt it would be great...

That's 2-4 good position upgrade money.|`|Hkb7xoaQaa	No way. As great as an athlete Albert Haynesworth is, he was still a bi-product of that outstanding defensive system down in Tennessee. Other teams had to worry about their complicated blitz schemes, their tremendous run stopping abilities and the very small windows allowed by them in the passing game. Haynesworth is an exceptional player, but teams had to worry about the guys around him more than just him, the line backers(Tulluch, Bullock and Thorton), the ends van den bosh and kearse, and the very aggressive and fast secondary in Finnegan, Hope and Griffin. All these guys played unbelievably well together and the loss of one big guy won't make that much of a difference.|`|om5MsOMmaa	I don't think that Albert Haynesworth was worth a 100 million dollars and I don't think the Titans thought he was either so why try to match 100 million.|`|AOA8TJraaa	yeah why but hes the damn god of that defense.|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	no they didnt screw up their cap on a guy that is injury prone|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	i don't think they had a choice|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Not for the price Haynesworth got out of Washington.

juNwy1aTaa	I asked a similar question and someone from yahoo answers gave me this response:<br>  <br>  The WWE knows that if they make him turn right now, it'd hurt his character. As much as the fans like the face Jericho, constantly switching allegiances is damaging to a character. Just think of it...<br>  <br>  The Big Show is a perfect example of people being unable to take someone seriously due to constant swings in personality. He started off as a heel and stayed that way for a while, and then was turned face and feuded with The Big Bossman. That was no problem. But then he got injured, and his return was the shaky ground that he's known to stand on today.<br>  <br>  Face for two months then a quick heel turn. Heel for about six months, then suddenly back to face, making mockeries of Hulk Hogan, Rikishi, and a few others... that lasted all of three months before another heel turn to team with Shane McMahon. Then turned face on Shane three months later. Then about 7 months after that, was turned heel again, before a heel-face-heel rush that led him into the story with Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar...<br>  <br>  He wobbled so much that even when he was champ, no one cared. They didn't know who he'd fight next, or why he'd fight them. Right now, he's a face against Edge, but he's defending Vickie... so he's a heel. What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br>  <br>  I miss old school Jericho, for certain. But Chris Jericho is an amazing talent, and one of the best wrestlers in the world. Just let him pull the heel role for another year before giving him another face turn. It's not right to burn a hole in the whole reason as to why he's turned on the fans... A face turn right now would be pointless... and just another drop in the bucket. In fact, with Orton being the only other heel main eventer on Raw, Jericho being face would just push him back down to the midcard, now that HBK and Cena are in the face limelight.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	i do and u kno he will never ever turn face|`|qt7QcmtPaa	I know I miss the old funny Jericho that ripped on Steph.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	That's the point.<br>  <br>  Jericho isn't supposed to be the same guy he was before. If he was, his heel turn wouldn't work.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	I do i liked it when he hated Randy Orton|`|qbEeecndaa	me|`|MNIUhMajaa	The old Jericho was delusional until I talked some sense into him. Hes now realized that the crowd is filled with hypocrites and parasites and he'll never pander to them again! Your right we'll never see the old Jericho again and Jericho along with myself are completely fine with that.|`|ETkqlgqwaa	Me too. I miss the fun one. All he does now is run his mouth, whine, and complain at the beginning of every Raw. He comes out in a suit and interrupts legends and attacks them. He's fond of beating on old men. Let's see him get in the ring and do something. I am sick of it.|`|67f8894911620eb3f7d20229e26e7d8baa	its not the attitude ear in the WWE anymore so the old Jericho coming back is a long shot, unless they get a real GM (being a heal) that can cause problems and Jericho becomes a baby that face fighting back against the authority|`|wum4X78maa	Yeah I miss the old one.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	No i think Randy is far too talented and charismatic to let two up-and-coming Superstars hold him back.He's a gifted third-generation Superstar who works an excellent style of technical powerhouse wrestling.He can work exciting matches and cut entertaining promos and in-ring segments.For sure Randy Orton is one of the most valuable ratings and merchandising assets to WWE and a definite future Hall of Famer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpZLoYD2us" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpZLoYD2...</a>|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Well if you look ahead and think Orton is helping them stand on their two feet.<br>  <br>  Cody Rhodes needs it for sure stiil and Ted well he needs some minor help.<br>  <br>  after that is done though they will probably either turn on him or Orton will turn on them.<br>  <br>  ORRRRR they will start causing havok.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	i've been saying this since they started building the group last year.<br>  <br>  i don't like ted dibiase first off. cody rhodes is.....ok i guess.<br>  <br>  but yea i was a big orton fan but ever since legacy started i like him less and less each week. everytime i see them i turn and i only do that for one other person......cena.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	What do you mean?<br>  <br>  If anything, Orton is helping out the other members of the Legacy by giving them recognition through him. It's not like Randy Orton isn't in the title hunt anyways, so what's the problem?|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Its the same formula Triple H used when he created Evolution.

ZpH2PFF9aa	You are 4?|`|tvuhGTD9aa	I coached 3 yo t-ball last year. Just getting one or two lessons to stick is a triumph -- that young they just don't have too much attention span.<br>  <br>  So what I used:<br>  <br>  hitting -- a piece of cardboard with footprints on it to help them get familiar with standing to address the ball. And, of course, keep your eye on the ball.<br>  <br>  running -- cones helping to mark the bases. Easier to see when you're only 3 feet tall.<br>  <br>  throwing -- give them a target. When there's something to throw the ball AT, they tend to try harder.<br>  <br>  The one lesson I did get to stick was: when throwing, step with the glove-side foot. Trying to step with the throwing-hand side leaves them off balance. Step with the glove side foot, good balance, a much better throw. And "glove side foot" is easy to understand even for kids who don't really get "right" and "left" yet.|`|frDcAqyWaa	put a mat next to the first baseline so they know where to drop the bat adn which way to run.  Other than that its running, catching, throwing and running.|`|lfr1iyiKaa	You can tell them when they try to catch the ball to get under it and to call the ball off.  Plus you can teach the what they do if they get a hit like to drop the bat to run to right side and not to run to 3rd base or to round second base if the think they can make it to the next base. Plus you can teach them to keep two hands on the bat at all times and to follow through with there hit. Also you can teach them what a force out means and a double play. Tell them there are 3 outs in an inning. Hit the ball to the out fielders. give grounders to them tell them how many outs before you hit it and the ghost runners that are on base. Or instead of ghost runners you can take 3-4 players and let them fake hit the ball at the same time you hit the ball. then let them run. Also you can split them in half have 1 race another to find the fastest. You can tell them how you throw the ball  catch the ball and there is more but i don't want to do anymore.<br>  <br>  P.S nice question.

KJmuHxcCaa	yes it is|`|iAIv62HXaa	Tennis is the best sport! Trust me, I've tried them all. Although many think that it requires no skill because the people who play tennis don't exactly have bulging muscles, it really takes a lot of skill to learn. <br>  <br>  Umm...it's fun, but only after you get good at it. In the beginning, you will find tennis very boring. I advise you have a friend teach you basic technique. Once you get past the part where you can't even hit a ball over a net, tennis will feel incredibly enjoyable. <br>  <br>  How long does it take to get good at it? Well, if you play every other day like I did, I'd say a solid five months. However, if you're looking to be #1, you're going to need five years of experience b4 trying out for a major team.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|CUJ2Gw8Haa	its pretty gay so NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You should probably try and get on with an acting school and take a few lessons.|`|MaFw69ePaa	i don't c y tha one guy put the mma thing for an actor but there's <a href="http://saigoworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://saigoworld.com</a> and a few others that will help to get u discovered as a martial arts actor. plz, if u don't kno any, learn some acrobatic moves. with realistic yet flashy guys like jet li and tony jaa u need to be able to deliver killer moves with a reasonable amount of flash for aesthetic pleasure of the viewer. so go to <a href="http://expertvillage.com" rel="nofollow">http://expertvillage.com</a> and type in xma, martial arts or wushu moves also, go to <a href="http://flashmavi.com," rel="nofollow">http://flashmavi.com,</a> theres alot of parkour and gymnastics moves as well as capoeira and breakdancing.|`|L1SIKavkaa	Well you can become a stunt man at first and after a few years go into acting school or go into acting school now and stay in shape. By the way stunt men get paid MAD money so if you get into that consider your self lucky but try not to die lol|`|AbcGOAFjaa	Black belt in what?

KJmuHxcCaa	pratice makes perfect|`|vxMJwivPaa	First of all make sure that you have a balanced diet.<br>  3 meals a day with fruits, vegetables, meat, bread, sugars. You need to have a lot of vitamins to keep you energized and from becoming lethargic so fruits and vegetables are very vital. As an athlete you need to be healthier than those who don't play sports.<br>  Also, you need to workout. Try running- you need to strengthen your cardio because as i'm sure you know, games can last for hours. You don't want to be getting tired only half way through the game.<br>  Also try arm strengthening and leg strengthening. Go to a gym and do bench, incline, squat, and deadlift. It will help immensely and will help you put more power into your serves and hits, a very good bonus.<br>  Also, practice practice practice.<br>  Try playing 3-4 times a week- at the LEAST.<br>  The only way that you will get better in tennis is if you practice, that's really the only way.<br>  Why do you think most pros start at such a young age? Think about it.<br>  Also, lessons never hurt. I would definitely get them. Don't necessarily get private lessons immediately. Start with group lessons where they're focusing on a few kids.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  :]|`|DQVVJCmAaa	-practice serves everyday<br>  -run<br>  -sprinting drills<br>  -just play a lot|`|EeGlkABPaa	practice lots
uS8hK7Zhaa	She's big enough to wrestle men, lol.<br>  <br>  Maybe she doesn't want to live in her father's shadow|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	She doesn't have any wrestling skills and she's as not as hot as the Divas WWE has right now and she's annoying as anything|`|caczNImxaa	because shes a prissy princess who wants everything she wants|`|OHBvEYKHaa	good idea|`|2GMvuliVaa	No please don't give the WWE anymore stupid ideas. Let her stick to her stupid music, theirs already enough sh*tty divas in wrestling|`|ETkqlgqwaa	She's more focused on singing. You'd think, since her father was the Hulk and she's really fit and hot, but wrestling isn't made out for everyone =[|`|M4VpW29Baa	she's said that she doesn't want to wrestle and that music is what she wants to do so she's STILL trying to get that going.|`|IVEdWA2uaa	Cause she's a buttaface.  Only woman she could wrestle is Vickie..if she wrestles any of the other divas her ugliness would rub off on them|`|AkpPTYN2aa	Cus she'll probably be given a dyer finisher. Just like her lame old fart of a father.|`|XLHa9hiiaa	shes just another typica rich blonde but pretty hot still|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Because she is looking for a music career which she has a great chance in.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I don't think she wants to fallow in her fathers foot steps personally I don't think she would be a very good wrestler.I think she would just obviously have the jobs because of looks and the fact that she is the daughter of arguably the most well known wrestler in history Hulk Hogan.And I'm pretty sure she is trying to make a singing career for her self.I haven't really ever listened to her singing so I don't know if she will actually make it big.But really I don't think she will become a wrestler.I don't think she is too interested in fallowing in her dad's foot steps.But if she ever wanted to I think she'd get the job because well look what Hulk Hogan has done for Vince McMahon's company.
