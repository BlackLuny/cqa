3dv7Qdoxaa	I know that the iMac is an all-in-one system, but it is a joke when talking about gaming. It's not that it's a slow computer (it's pretty fast), it's just that so few games are made for Mac computers compared to PC's. And it's so expensive...<br>  <br>  There's also the Gateway One (or Gateway ZX190). It's the same as an iMac, it's a screen and computer in one. But, it's not that great for gaming either. It has a relatively slow CPU, a low end graphics card, and only 2 gigs of slow RAM (that's not very much for gaming). Although, it only costs about $1,300.<br>  <br>  If you really want a computer for gaming, just settle for a regular desktop computer. Nothing beats a desktop PC in terms of gaming. <br>  <br>  You could also get a gaming laptop which, as you know, is all in one. But, again, they won't perform as well as a desktop and they will be VERY expensive (gaming laptops are always expensive).|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	You have to look at the components of the computer that you are interested in. There are some great laptops that are great for gaming and they are the ultimate "ALL-IN-ONE" computer|`|IFtV7g2Zaa	HP, Dell, Sony, and perhaps others.  How fast they are depends on how much money you have to spend.  You can buy gamer computers in this fashion, or you can buy slow ones.<br>  <br>  But remember, there are trade-offs.  Once the warranty expires, repairs may be expensive.<br>  <br>  If you have an all-in-one footprint computer, and the monitor dies, then the replacement cost is likely to cost more than replacing the computer.<br>  <br>  All repair parts will have to be gotten from the manufacturer.  Besides being all-in-one, these computers are highly proprietary.  You'll have to wait for parts.  None of the local repair shops will stock the parts.|`|b26dca23d6a16d8a319588f759f18bbdaa	Apple imac<br>  everything is in the monitor (no tower to waste space)<br>  depends of what is fast for you, I am pretty sure that you can play on it

fE7zhp3Caa	Most laptops are designed to handle different DC voltages.  The voltages on batteries are almost always 3 to 5 volts less than what the same laptop receives through its AC adapter.<br>  <br>  The higher mAh (milliamp hour) rating means it has a larger capacity i.e. it lasts longer than a battery with a lower rating when both are under the same load.<br>  <br>  As long as the battery's voltage isn't higher than your AC adapter's, you *shouldn't* have any problems with it, but do some comparison shopping to make sure other sellers are offering the same batteries as compatible with your laptop, just to be sure.  You can also contact Gateway and confirm the specs on a 6600mAh battery they would sell you.<br>  <br>  If you're doing your search based on your laptop model and are sticking with reputable companies, you shouldn't run into trouble.<br>  <br>  Other advice is to buy a new battery whenever possible.  Used and refurbished have lesser warranties (if any) and generally don't last as long.  The price difference rarely makes sense in the slightly longer term.|`|J6djgkOOaa	Yes you can if the manufacturer designed your laptop to handle that voltage.  I use the same battery as you and have a 14.8V battery and it works just fine.  Basically Gateway gave you a lower performing battery with your laptop.

RjwyRrxtaa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|OvwFw7n8aa	get more ram, example, if you have 1 gig, it struggles to run, so upgrade to 2gb, 3gb or 4gb.

6ctxuU3Waa	are you working with footage of people on green screen?  a couple of things come to mind if so.  first, use the fill effect to make them silhouettes.  you could keyframe the opacity of the fill and have them become more defined as they approach.  you could also make your people 3d layers and, using a comp camera with the depth of field turned on, you could have them move towards that camera and into focus.  for creating the fog, you could use a particle system or fractal noise.  see videocopilot.net for more info on how to make the fog look nice (i think theres a tutorial that covers smoke and fog type stuff)  come to think of it, you can get a plugin there that will basically do the whole deal for you.

The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

All you have to do is go there and it'll tell you what passwords you use for different things like your e-mail, accounts etc. All those passwords you have is protected by a master password that you create so no one else can have access to them.

DjGEJfaPaa	Your machine is infected. Pop-ups are mostly caused by adware, spyware, and other malicious and unwanted software and using pop-up blocker won't help an infected PC. Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware are the best anti-spyware applications available (you can have more than one). Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.<br>  <br>  If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.<br>  <br>  Running virus removal programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective. The idea behind the Safe Mode is that the operating system would only load your essential programs and drivers to the memory and hence there is a “high” chance that the virus-infected file is on the drive but not loaded into memory. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend using Firefox as your primary Web browser, it's safer and better than Internet Explorer. Get the add-on NoScript for Firefox to prevent click-jacking. The AdBlock Plus extension will allow you to surf virtually ad-free. If you add-on McAfee SiteAdvisor, it will warn you of potentially harmful sites. I also recommend CCleaner which is a free system optimization and privacy tool.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Sam's got xlnt advice...<br>  After you get clean, try these steps to reduce trash:<br>  Parasite & Pirate defense measures<br>  <br>  Try malwarebytes to clean up your system:<br>  <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/Malwarebytes_Anti-Malware_d5756.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorgeeks.com/Malwarebytes_A...</a><br>  SpywareBlaster for system wide, realtime protection:<br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/security/fwantispy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/securi...</a><br>  <br>  An avalanche of money hungry advertising schemes are sweeping the entire internet.<br>  Don't let the battalions of external parasites into your system in the first place by taking an active defense posture to stop these guys @ your 'doorstep' and keep 'em out.

elhRdmuFaa	I haven't done any MIPS assembly in a long time, but why don't you just subtract the offset which is 48 from the ASCII byte value. If the characters is '0' the byte value is 48, so 48 - 48 is 0. If it was '1' then 49 - 48 is 1. That would get the register into a state where it is either zero or one.<br>  <br>  Once again I have not done MIPS in a long time, so I didn't test this code but it should work. It is located here on pastebin nicely formatted:<br>  <a href="http://pastebin.com/f3ede4392" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/f3ede4392</a><br>  <br>  I also pasted it below, but Y!

You might have to do a few in different sizes and print a few to see which works best and comes out best.

2vL8wOHZaa	Yes a DirectX 10 video card will run DirectX 9 games. I hope this helped.|`|SNDxHMjQaa	Yes Directx10 is fully backward compatible.|`|kIM8LUPVaa	Yes, a DirectX 10 card is backwards compatible to a DirectX 9. I'm not sure what kind of money you're looking to spend, but I would probably spend at least $150 or more. A good card for the money right now is an ATI 4850 and it’s around that price range if you buy it online. <br>  <br>  Also, last I knew Direct X 10 is only for Windows Vista, so if you wanted to take full advantage of the new D10 card you would need the Vista OS. Most games have it as an option; for example when the D10 mode is turned on in “Far Cry” the graphics are enhanced. I personally don’t notice enough of a difference to warrant buying vista. I’m sure people will disagree with me.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  2. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  3. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  4. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  5. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  6. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #1 and #2.|`|AA11250869	Windows Live Care is not a very useful product.

T6V9zXymaa	I feel it would be wrong to just answer this question without first expressing my sympathy for your loss. It's always difficult to lose someone close to you.<br>  <br>  I wish I had better news for you on the computer front, but it might be very difficult to get access to your sister's account. If she created a "reminder," I would look at that first. My reminders tend to be almost as complex as my passwords, but some people use things like "What is the make of my first car?" and that might give you a clue as to her password.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I can think of off of the top of my head is that if you're using Windows XP Home Edition, you can try to log in as an Administrator in Safe Mode, which should allow you to make changes to her account (including removing a password, so you can access it freely). Again, that's a long shot, but if you're desperate it should work. Also, be aware that if Windows XP Professional is installed, this option will not be available to you.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your level of Windows expertise is, but if you really need help, I'd be willing to work this out through e-mail (this kind of thing can get pretty complex!).

GxofM7X0aa	I must answer this as delicately as possible.  If you ask your boyfriend what he's been looking at and he says, "Nothing" or "It's none of your business", then he is either planning a surprise for you in which could be a great thing or he's doing or looking at something that he feels that you would find offensive.  If the later is the true case, then only he can stop such actions.  If you believe the later is the truth and he doesn't offer any alternative, then your trust of him falls short of being accepted by you.  I am not a counselor or a therapist of sorts but this, I feel, is not an issue of you finding out exactly what he's been doing but instead a challenge of trust.  Please talk to a more qualified person such as a couple's therapist or your pastor or youth director at your church.  Spending the time finding out what he's been doing may be more destructive to your relationship because he may honestly be looking at items pertaining to a hobby of his that he may think you may think it's silly.  He might be embarrassed to tell you about this area of his life right now.  Don't assume the worst when it may be nothing at all.

So, with that in mind, the best laptop should ideally have:<br>  <br>  - Large and comfortable screen (at least 14.1")<br>  - Mouse input that allows percision control<br>  - Fast processor (dual core, 2.0GHz+) and lots of RAM (2GB+)<br>  <br>  So, you're basically looking at the best-equipped laptop in your price range. The mouse input is probably going to be the most interesting part - for those, I recommend either a Lenovo Thinkpad or Dell Latitude E-series, as those have a "mouse lever" in the middle of the keyboard that allows much better percision control than a trackpad.

dfjIBHe3aa	I don't currently use Fedora.  In fact, even though it's a complaint which is irrelevant,  it involves Fedora 8, 9, and this laptop.<br>  <br>  I originally installed Fedora 8 from a LiveCD with KDE as the desktop which was (though I didn't realize it) corrupted.  I did a complete reinstall with yum and it fixed it so beautifully I immediately used yum to upgrade to 9.  <br>  I used this guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/Upgrading_Red_Hat_Linux_with_yum.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/Upgradi...</a><br>  <br>  9 didn't like it when I tried to sign in on text mode.  It wanted me to sign in to the windows system.  The Windows system was KDE 4.0.  I was on Gentoo Linux within two days.<br>  <br>  I haven't looked over that guide, or this one:<br>  <a href="http://nixcraft.com/getting-started-tutorials/233-yum-fedora-linux-howto.html" rel="nofollow">http://nixcraft.com/getting-started-tuto...</a><br>  but in essence the problem was your yum config file (whatever it's called) had the CD as a repository it was ALWAYS supposed to check.  The way to take it out is to find the yum config file and delete the line or put a pound sign in front of it.  Good luck with Fedora Core 10.  Selinux was the reason it likes X-Windows so much.

Laptop video cards are also different than a desktop card, you can't just stick a desktop card in there and be done with it.<br>  The problem is that its a Dell and it's not a "gaming Dell" even, whatever that is. It's got a pretty bad card in it, which is why you are having problems.<br>  Bottom line, ya can't really upgrade it.
kS9ZtIFfaa	What are you on about|`|q7MIcWBBaa	it depends on what font it is (for certain ones) and .. it woudln't be a CTRL+ALT combination though .. CTRL+ALT combo's are windows function short cuts .. it would simply be ALT+# combination .. <br>  <br>  for example .. an upside down question mark would be ALT+168(?)<br>  a female symbol would be ALT+11 (♂)<br>  a degree symbol would be ALT+167 (o)<br>  <br>  i mean you can just click random numbers and find cool things lol <br>  <br>  but you can go to character map and figure most out .. <br>  generally it will tell you that it's U+# .. U = ALT (i'm pretty sure)<br>  <br>  you can go to start | accessories | system tools | character map .. and play with the fonts to learn how to type certain ones ..

Click OK.<br>  <br>  3) The Taskbar may have shrunk or moved to another edge of the screen.  To fix this:<br>  <br>  1. Look for a thin line on one edge of the screen.  <br>  2. Right click in the thin line.<br>  3. Drag it towards the center of the screen to make it big again.<br>  4.

Uncheck the Auto-Hide the Taskbar menu item.<br>  8. Click OK.<br>  <br>  If none of these help, then the process that runs the desktop, explorer.exe, has probably died.

m13Se2dAaa	A couple thoughts...<br>  <br>  1) When you just click in the image with the text tool, you get a text insertion point. When you type, you should see the text, but it is not paragraph formatted so, for example, if you don't put in a return, it will run off the page.<br>  <br>  However, if you use the text tool and draw a box on your image, you will have created a text box that the type will wrap in. However, you will only see the text within the box you drew, the rest of it won't show though you'll see it in layer palette. Try double clicking on the layer (double click the T, not the whole layer). Hopefully you will see some handles - the lower right one would have an X in it. Grab that handle and pull and enlarge until you see your text.<br>  <br>  2) You could have your image resolution set so stinking low you just can't see the text! Go to the Image pulldown menu --> Image Size and see what the resolution is set for. If it's something like 5, that's definitely your problem. You need to reset the resolution, but before you do, unclick the box that says resample image so that you don't resize the picture.Set it to at least 72 pixels per inch.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I swear this exact thing just happened to me. So now we have number ...<br>  <br>  3) Somehow (because of weird line spacing or where the paragraph is set) you text is there but it is OFF the page. Zoom way, way, way out - so the canvas is the size of a postage stamp, hit ctrl+T and see if you see the transform handles somewhere out in the gray. That's what just happened to me. I just zoomed back in a bit, got in the middle of the handles and dragged it back on the page.|`|FEQMb7wIaa	Make sure you're not using a white font on a white background, or black on black. I'm betting that's what's wrong.|`|d7eceae57155ab266d32049456b7c51eaa	Could be your text layer is BELOW another layer with a graphic on it. In this case drag your text layer above it.|`|oVDjMzlMaa	change the color of the text
DjGEJfaPaa	Your machine is infected. Pop-ups are mostly caused by adware, spyware, and other malicious and unwanted software and using pop-up blocker won't help an infected PC. Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware are the best anti-spyware applications available (you can have more than one). Other free anti-spyware programs would be Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.<br>  <br>  If you do not have an updated anti-virus program always running, you need to get one. Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free.<br>  <br>  Running virus removal programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective. The idea behind the Safe Mode is that the operating system would only load your essential programs and drivers to the memory and hence there is a “high” chance that the virus-infected file is on the drive but not loaded into memory. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend using Firefox as your primary Web browser, it's safer and better than Internet Explorer. Get the add-on NoScript for Firefox to prevent click-jacking. The AdBlock Plus extension will allow you to surf virtually ad-free. If you add-on McAfee SiteAdvisor, it will warn you of potentially harmful sites. I also recommend CCleaner which is a free system optimization and privacy tool.|`|NvwdFgzWaa	Quick and easy fix.<br>  you can just kill the startup. so it won't start with your computer<br>  goto Start, Run type in MSCONFIG goto Startup Tab and look at all of the startups that start with your computer. you can hid disable all on the startups and your computer will run fine and much faster.

You can not access the rich graphics details of most current games with those cards. The 8300GS is better because it supports newer Shader version. <br>  <br>  FX5200 is pretty outdated. If it uses AGP platform, it is not even compatible with the PCIe slot of your newer PC.

In order to get a literal long value add an L to the end of it.  So your declaration should look like:<br>  long num = 600851475143L;<br>  <br>  Oh and just for future info, BigInteger won't autobox for you.  If you wanted to use a BigInteger you could initialize it with a String:<br>  BigInteger num = new BigInteger("600851475143");

AygEpMMaaa	if u r getting the internet off some1 elses router u will keep losing the signal cos the signal will be weak.<br>  <br>  if its your internet and u haven`t setup a password then its likely some1 is connected 2 your router,so i would put a password on it asap plus having wireless things like microwaves and cordless phones can break the wireless signal,u could get a repeater 2 make the signal stronger<br>  <br>  this is how u setup a password<br>  <br>  Most wireless routers are configured through your Internet browser. So you must connect your wireless router to a computer. <br>  <br>  Type your router's IP address into your browser's address bar. You can find the IP address in your router's manual. You'll be prompted for a user name and password. These will also be listed in your manual.<br>  <br>  You want to use WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) encryption to protect your network. You'll typically see this setting as WPA-PSK (pre-shared key). You'll be prompted to enter a password of eight to 63 characters--letters, numbers and symbols. The router will use the password to build an encryption key.<br>  <br>  WPA2 is the latest and safest version of WPA. The only weak point of WPA2 is your password. So make it as strong as possible. Here is a tip that will help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security..." rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security..." rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security...</a> <br>  <br>  Your router may use WPA, the forerunner to WPA2. If so, be sure your password has at least 21 characters. <br>  <br>  The earliest security standard is WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). Don't use that; it is easily broken. Check the router manufacturer's site for updates. If there aren't any, don't use the router to go online.<br>  <br>  Now you must update your computers. Click Start>>Control Panel. Double-click Network Connections. Right-click Wireless Network Connection. Select Properties from the pop-up menu and select the Wireless Networks tab. You should see your network listed under "Preferred networks." Select it and click Properties. If it's not listed, click the Add button. In the box labeled "Network name (SSID)," enter your network's name.<br>  <br>  Under Network Authentication, select WPA-PSK. Select AES under "Data encryption." Under "Network key," enter the same password you used for your router. You must enter it twice to confirm it. Make sure "The key is provided for me automatically" is not checked. Click OK>>OK.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Connect (wired) Modem to Router (wireless) to PCs. <br>  =<br>  Set router POWER OFF.<br>  -<br>  Reset modem: With a straightened paperclip, press RESET button momentarily.<br>  -<br>  Wait 60 secs.<br>  -<br>  Set router POWER ON.<br>  -<br>  Reset router: With a straightened paperclip, press RESET button momentarily.<br>  -<br>  Wait 60 secs.<br>  -<br>  PC Command Line:<br>  -<br>  Click [Start] - Click [Run...] - enter: cmd, Click [OK]<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /release, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /renew, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  TEST: Connect to Internet.<br>  -<br>  If SUCCESS:  Repeat Steps after PC Command Line on your other PCs.<br>  -<br>  If NO SUCCESS:<br>  -<br>  At the prompt (c:\.....>) enter: ipconfig /all, press [ENTER]<br>  -<br>  Ensure DHCP Enabled == YES<br>  -<br>  If IP Address == 0.0.0.0 OR 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255, connect PC (wired) to router (if possible) or modem and perform ALL steps again.<br>  -

As far as connecting the new modem, you will not have to change any of the settings in your router.  Just connect the new modem where the old one was.  Some ISPs may have you do some small configurations the first time you log on to the internet but they have no effect on your router.  <br>  <br>  Note: If you have to purchase a new cable modem, make sure you call the ISP and give them the MAC address of the new modem before you connect it.

Then use a for loop to read into the arrays.<br>  <br>  int[] nums1 = new int[12];<br>  int[] nums2 = new int[12];<br>  for(int c = 0; c<12; c++)<br>  {<br>       nums1[c] = inputFile.nextInt();<br>       nums2[c] = inputFile.nextInt();<br>  }<br>  <br>  After you run that code you'll have two arrays of size 12 containing all 24 numbers. If you want to find the sums,<br>  <br>  int sum1 = 0;<br>  int sum2 = 0;<br>  for(int c = 0; c<12; c++)<br>  {<br>       sum1+=nums1[c];<br>       sum2+=nums2[c];<br>  }<br>  <br>  After you run that code you'll have the total sum for each array stored in the sum1 and sum2 variables.

But in reality, this is not worth anything in this market.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to save a little more, you can easily buy a new computer under $400, which you will be so much happier and will last you a lot longer.<br>  <br>  Go to hp.com, they have a good deal.<br>  <br>  Or keep an eye on Best Buy, each week they have notebook or desktop computers on sale under $400.<br>  <br>  So keep your money for now and just keep saving until you can afford a much better and faster computer.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.
Hwe7pmZRaa	Hey Matt- <br>  Jeff here with the Windows Outreach Team. The Windows 7 Beta download is no longer available to download.  If you can find someone who has the ISO on a DVD and will load you their DVD then you can still get the Beta. Otherwise you are out of luck.  The RC will be released in the coming months which should be more stable than the Beta, but Microsoft has not yet specified its general availability. For updates on this keep checking back on the Windows 7 homepage or the Windows Team blog which can be found at the Windows 7 homepage.<br>  Cheers,<br>  Jeff<br>  Windows Outreach Team|`|0AeH1pVuaa	Microsoft have now ended the customer BETA test program.<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/beta-download.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...</a>

It's a scam, you aren't downloading a fix, you're downloading the spyware itself.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to back up all of your important material and find somebody who knows how (or do it yourself) and reinstall your operating system.  After that, be very careful before you download and install software.  Google the software first to see if it is suspected of carrying malware.|`|bGO1AmEqaa	Get this program called AVG Antivirus, its by a company called Grisoft they offer a free version and a paid version both work great.

That card should work fine, though in my personal experience, you'll want to purchase a more powerful power supply as well.eMachine's power supplies are usually pretty weak.<br>  <br>  2.

There's no benefit to your CPU being overclocked when it's not working its hardest. Bring both cores to full burn with a program like Orthos or Prime95 and check the temperature then.<br>  <br>  2.75 to 3.025GHz (FSB of 1000-1100Mhz) is a good target overclock for the stock fan.

The problem is with Users like yourself who are so resistant to change that they label anything that they don't already know as "cr@p".<br>  <br>  The problem is with you, not with Vista.<br>  <br>  There is plenty of help out there online.

They rush out to buy wanting to boast they have the latest OS then can't be bothered to learn how to use it or appreciate just how good it is and designed specifically for the way most people seem to use their computers these days - for playing, for downloading music, watching movies etc rather than using the traditional programs.What on earth would be the point in developing new systems if they were just the same as the old ones? It just takes a little time, a little curiosity to find out how to use the system which really is not much different at all from previous and of course to have a computer with the capability of taking it.|`|qmWEGycFaa	Can they do so much better? 2 of the last 3 operating systems (ME and Vista) have been crap. <br>  <br>  If you only use Vista on a stand alone computer or on a network that has all Vista machines you will not see how much of a PITA Vista is. Once you mix in  one computer running a different OS into a network the fun begins. If you call several hours of troubleshooting fun.<br>  <br>  Windows 7 does look promising though. I have been using the beta since it came out and I think it will be a fairly large improvement over Vista and it plays nice on my XP/Vista/Linux network.|`|U1OCUW8qaa	It's excellent I like it|`|AA10265922	go back to XP

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. That's the only way to know all the malware is gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #3 and #4.|`|v3ncANM5aa	If your having that many problems your best bet would be to reformat and start over.

wRytd4dPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The only way to profit from a website is to get traffic (people visiting your site). This will not automatically happen if you put a site online. You need to figure out what niche you're in (e.g. insurance, selling books etc.) then find out which 'keywords' are the most searched for in your niche (e.g. best car insurance, cheapest insurance premiums etc.). Then you need to try to rank your site for those keywords so that people searching in search engines see your site first and go to it. Once you have people visiting there are many ways to monetize:<br>   - put contextual ads like adsense<br>   - sell ads directly<br>   - sell a product<br>   - offer services<br>   - sell informational products<br>   - offer a paid subscription<br>   - etc.<br>  <br>  Of course most of those things are not easy to do, so the first thing would probably be to learn more about online marketing, blogging etc.|`|zGkqGZzYaa	Most web sites are developed for buisness purposes by offering a Product, Service, or Idea for SALE.<br>  Then they post there services by creating a web site to offer them.<br>  To create a web site you must have a Domain Name, (Your sites IP Address) <br>  Next you need a Web Host.

Mp3 is technically MPEG, so if you look at the info tab, it may very well say MPEG. But you cannot make music into a movie. If it has the wrong extension, you can rename the extension. I have no idea what you are saving it with, but it should offer you a choice and mp3 should be one of those choices, but since you did not mention what program you are using, I do not know your entire situation. <br>  <br>  If you are using a movie editor to edit a sound file in and of itself, then this may happen and you should only be using a sound editor. Still, if the the option to save as mp3 does not exist, right click, rename, change it to mp3 yourself. Or, if you play it in Media Player Classic or VLC it will pay as a music file anyway.<br>  <br>  Extensions, extensions, we don't need no stinkin' extensions!

IFtV7g2Zaa	The quality of the picture is dependent on all of the following factors, and maybe a few more that I haven't thought of.<br>  <br>  1) Monitor quality:  if the monitor cannot display the resolution that is being output, then quality will suffer.<br>  <br>  2) Graphics card quality:  The graphics card might be too slow or not have the right capabilities for quality playback.  <br>  <br>  3) DVD drive quality: The DVD drive must be capable of reading data off the DVD fast enough to supply a continuous feed to your software.  If it cannot supply data fast enough, or move track to track fast enough, then picture quality will suffer.<br>  <br>  4) The playback software must be able to read the format on the disk, be able to talk directly to the video card, and be able to do it as cleanly as possible.  This is why some playback software states xyz was optimized for use one such and so (e.g., NVIDIA) video cards.<br>  <br>  5) Quality of your computer: many cheap computers simply lack the horsepower to play DVDs with high quality.  The best quality picture comes from the highest speed data buses, and they don't come cheap.<br>  <br>  6) How many other applications are running on your computer when you're trying to watch a DVD?  If the antivirus software is running a scan, picture quality will be impacted.  If you computer is bogged down by spyware, picture quality may be choppy.  For the best picture, minimize what's running in the background.<br>  <br>  7) How fast is your hard drive?  Remember part of the equation of a fast enough computer depends on temporary buffer space.  A computer's virtual memory is resident in RAM and on the hard drive.  If the hard drive is slow...like some laptops....then when the playback software tries to read-ahead and buffer so many seconds of video, then it will be choppy as it tries to read the buffer off the hard drive.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  8) How good is the recording on the DVD?  Even the best hardware can't provide a good picture for a crappy recording.<br>  <br>  9) Is the DVD clean?  A dirty disc will effect playback and therefore picture quality.<br>  :End Edit<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are others.  But those are the highlights.

You could also invest in getting more fans to circulate air. If this doesn't help you, then it could mean that one of the connections from the power supply unit to the connections is bending too much causing a bad signal, in this case just go into the case and make sure that none of the wires especially any of the yellow 12v wires are not bending too sharply. Finally the only other problem with your power supply unit is that it is dying. The power supply unit itself is pretty easy to purchase since most cases and computers sold in the last 7 years use the standard ATX or ATX 12v Power Supply Unit, and will install into the existing location of your power supply unit. No matter what size of case as long as the case is ATX or smaller mATX any standard ATX or ATX 12v power supply unit should be able to be installed into your existing case. So you should at least spend around $40 to $50 on the power supply unit itself. <br>  If you have anymore questions about my answer, please contact me and I will gladly continue to help you. <br>  Have a nice day<br>  Ken|`|beLSHjWbaa	Is it really turning off, or maybe it just hubernating or fall in a sleep in the other words.<br>  Go to Control Panel -> Performance and Maintenanace -> Power Options<br>  Pay close attention to Hybernation and oter stuf that might help your problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lJ2baVliaa	It can be a faulty power supply, motherboard or video card or your CPU overheating.  It can also be something corrupt in the Operating System or a virus.  I would first check to make sure the Processor (CPU) is properly seated and the heat sink/fan is clean! Then if that doesn't work... do a full format of the Operating System... if the problem persists then I would replace the power supply (because it's the cheapest and it doesn't hurt to have an extra around even if that isn't the problem).  If that doesn't work, I'd replace the video card (probably due for an upgrade anyway)... then if that doesn't work, I'd finally try the motherboard, but that should be the absolute last resort.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Litha|`|DEHN1qmraa	It could be a virus.<br>  <br>  However, it could also be a overheating problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  Open your case, and make sure all your fans are working ok.<br>  <br>  Clean out any dust, and debris, especially from the fans and heatsinks.<br>  <br>  Remove the heatsink from your cpu, and clean off the old thermal pad/paste using a little isopropyl alcohol. reapply some new thermal paste, and reattach the heatsink.<br>  <br>  Look HERE (<a href="http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_silver_instructions.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_silve...</a> for instructions on how to apply thermal paste.<br>  <br>  Check your system temperatures.

6W4ZWOetaa	I'm a freelance Web Designer/Developer/Programmer.  I make $25/hour for web design, and $40+/hr for the rest of it, which roughly translates to between 40-60K a year if I get enough clients.  Pretty good :)<br>  <br>  C/C++ are the worst languages to learn.  Most people who will hire you do not want people who program in those languages because most apps are no longer written with them.<br>  <br>  If you go to school, C/C++ will probably be the first things that they teach you because they are good fundamental programming languages to learn.<br>  <br>  Most of what I do is in PHP honestly.  We also use Perl at our company, Java, and AJAX.  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to find a field that you want to specialize in; like what do you want to program?  Who do you want to cater to?<br>  <br>  For example the company I work for focuses on GIS, which is online maps.  We provide a lot of apps to nonprofits and environmental groups.<br>  <br>  For web design I focus on small businesses and non-profits.  <br>  <br>  You don't *have* to go to school for it, but I think it's better.  My degree is actually in Music, and my husband (who does the same thing that I do) has his degree in psychology.<br>  <br>  We ended up getting into computers later.  (He's been doing this 15 years, I've been doing it for five).  Because we didn't go for school it, we've made sure to get all the certifications we can because it looks good on our resumes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Read all you can, talk to people (looks like you're doing that here), and I hope that programming turns out to be what you really want to do :)  <br>  <br>  I love my job.  I work from home, I set my own hours, and I have no danger of losing my job during the recession.  <br>  <br>  Wish you all the best.|`|u2s1dt5eaa	You have to be a specialist (like you need to be an expert in a very specific field, e.g. cryptography expert, or you know MPEG4 algorithm inside out) to earn good money. <br>  A generalist is tough to be in the contractor business, especially in this economy.<br>  If you are good and know your stuff, it doesn't matter whether you have a degree or not.

Depending on how old your machine is and how much crap you've acquired on it, some of your other software might be confusing it.   <br>  <br>  I'd try a non-destructive restore to get everything back to square one.  if that doesn't work, the pad could be at fault.

There are all kinds of things running in the background that can bump into each other:   Windows updates,  anti-virus updates,  sleep modes, other scheduled tasks.    I'll stick with my restore advice.   Also, I turn off all the automatic updates and do them manually, so I don't have them disrupting an important job by surprise. <br>   <br>  Sometimes I long for the days of DOS, when my computer did what I told it to do.

It will work for either 2003 or 2007 version. Obviously, you have to know the total size of your presentation, but if you compress to MP3s, you should be able to fit your show onto a CD, if it is not too long.<br>  <br>  The other consideration is the size of the recipient's e-mail box. When you include audio files, this increases the size tremendously. You may want to re-think sending such a huge file via e-mail, especially if the recipient has a limit  -<br>  <br>  FYI, I did a show that was about 7 minutes in length and even after converting the audio, it was still 7MB.

A byte is eight characters of data. Therefore, eight bits make a byte. Your computer processes information in a series of eight bits, or, one byte. Here is where the numbers could get a bit (no pun intended) confusing. To make a 128 megabyte memory module, you need eight 128 megabit parts. Remember, it takes eight bits to make a single byte, so multiply 128 megabits by eight parts and you get a total of 128 megabytes...;-)

RxkGpV7xaa	hi, do you mean sound recording?<br>  <br>  You can record what you hear here:<br>  <a href="http://www.audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.audacity.sourceforge.net/</a> <br>  <br>  This lets you record sounds on your computer, and as far as I'm aware, used by millions of users (don't quote me). It is popular where I live though (everyone I ask has either used or heard of it).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  It doesn't need connecting to skype. As long as you've told Audacity to record from your sound card (which is where skype should be going), it will record the conversation for you.

4ZwGu3hyaa	It's impossible to do this with only HTML, but don't worry; I whipped up  a quick javascript chunk of code that can solve this problem.<br>  <br>  <html><br>  <head><br>  <title><br>   Javascript<br>  </title><br>  <br>  <script type="text/javascript"><br>   function password(){<br>    var x = prompt("Password");<br>     if( x == "Me" ){<br>      window.open("http://www.google.com...<br>     }<br>     else{<br>      window.open("Http://www.yahoo.com/...<br>     }<br>   }<br>  </script><br>  <br>  </head><br>  <body onLoad="password()"><br>   <center><br>    Please Refresh Page and Enter Password<br>   </center><br>  </body><br>  </html><br>  <br>  Now, I have to tell you to change something, or else this is pointless. you see when people click "View source" they can see what they have to type in to go to your web-page. Don't worry, in order to solve this problem just attach the javascript sop people can't see whats inside it. So your new HTML will look a little like this...<br>  <br>  <html><br>  <head><br>  <title><br>   Javascript<br>  </title><br>  <br>  <script type="text/javascript" src="Location of your javascript.js"><br>  //don't forget the .js, very important<br>  </script><br>  <br>  </head><br>  <body onLoad="password()"><br>   <center><br>    Please Refresh Page and Enter Password<br>   </center><br>  </body><br>  <br>  Now inside you javascript will be the same code, and just to make sure you get it I'll write it again for you...<br>  <br>   function password(){<br>    var x = prompt("Password");<br>     if( x == "Me" ){<br>      window.open("http://www.google.com...<br>     }<br>     else{<br>      window.open("Http://www.yahoo.com/...<br>     }<br>   }<br>  <br>  Now, of course you don't want them to go to google when they type in the correct password, so just change the google link to your website and the yahoo page to the alternative link.<br>  <br>  One more thing. For my example the Pass word is "Me". you can change this to what ever you want.

JGBhN6FUaa	The "E" is the data type of the variable you are creating. If you want to make an integer you would say: private int data. If you want to make a ListNode of type integer you would say: private ListNode<int> next. <br>  <br>  Mentioning the data type is no required if you are making a collection of items. You simply need to say what type of collection it is: List, ArrayList, Vector ... If you do not mention what data type each node in the collection is, then it is of type "Object" and you will have to type cast it in order to access it properly.

IFtV7g2Zaa	If you develop software, there are really three applications that you develop.<br>  1) Your software<br>  2) The Installer<br>  3) The Uninstaller<br>  <br>  Just like your own software, you have full control over how the software is installed or uninstalled.  You can choose several different installers to work with, or you can develop one of your own.  Some of the more common installers are:<br>  1) Microsoft Installer (.msi)<br>  2) Installshield<br>  3) Wise Installer<br>  4) Advanced Installer<br>  <br>  At one time or another, I've used all of these.  My favorites by far, are Wise and the Advanced Installer, for ease of use and functionality and price.<br>  <br>  If you don't want the databases removed during the uninstall process, then don't create code that removes them.|`|MxculX2Daa	This is pretty standard stuff and it is no different for any software.<br>  <br>  The way to achieve what you want is through the concept of "documents". The database file should be savable as a document that goes into the user's profile in their documents folder.<br>  <br>  This means that even if the application is un-installed the document, containing the data, is still in the documents folder.<br>  <br>  Your database documents should ideally have a unique file extension that is associated with the application so that double-clicking the document opens the application and the document.<br>  <br>  All of the handles for this are built into any standard application development tool.

It's fast and easy enough for a first time password cracker with basic Windows skills.<br>  <br>  If you still can't locate your password, even after using password recovery tools, you will need to perform a clean install of Windows Vista which will erase everything on your PC.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	If its good sometimes and not others I would suspect an interference issue.  Try a different channel!  Most routers ship with either channel 1, 6 or 11 as the default. If something is interfering just switching may solve the issue period. If you are on channel 1, try 11, on 6 try 1 or 11, then try the ones in between.  (1,6,11 will overlap with the other channels but the others are still fully usable, the strongest signal wins!) You can change the channel by just logging on to the router and wireless settings.<br>  <br>  If that isn't the issue, just try a better antenna on the router. There are several higher gain antennas made for them and they will increase the coverage area.<br>  <br>  Shifting to N is also an option BUT the router and card have to change for it to do any good.

Create a new variable to hold the result:<br>  <br>  int trueSpeed = speed;<br>  if(isBirthday)<br>  int trueSpeed -= 5;<br>  <br>  Then, it's just a matter of checking the cases.  Since you only have three, you only need to check the upper and lower bound.  Like this:<br>  <br>  if(trueSpeed < 61)<br>  return 0;<br>  <br>  if(trueSpeed > 80)<br>  return 2;<br>  <br>  return 1;<br>  <br>  This correctly returns 0 if the speed was less than 60, correctly returns 2 if the speed was over 80, and returns 1 if it was neither.  Notice you don't have to check for the last case, because it's the only option left at this point.  It also takes the birthday into account because it was already subtracted earlier.

It only has 1 GB RAM and the crappy 1.6 GHz Intel Atom processor N270. Your current PC has better hardware which is better for gaming. Just because the hard drive is larger doesn`t always mean it is better for gaming. The processor affects the whole system if it is slow.  The laptop you want is just for the internet, which is why they call that a netbook.<br>  Next time look at the processor and plus the laptop you want has a single core processor which is slower than your lucky and fast duel core processor.<br>  Also, get a desktop like this, because desktops have good performance and high power and you can upgrade for better performance.

However, the mouse moving for no reason may be something to worry about.  The closest thing I can tell you to look for is to search your computer for a file called patch.exe<br>  <br>  This is the common filename for the Netbus trojan or maybe even VNC(which is not a virus/trojan).<br>  <br>  As long as the mouse does not click anything then you really shouldn't worry.  <br>  <br>  By the way, a remote user is not spyware, usually they are connecting to your computer by a trojan horse.  Spyware is software that wants you to buy something or will monitor your computer's activies (passwords, usernames, etc) without you knowing.

You can upload as much as you want up to 600MB per upload at any resolution at any length.  I use no other website for my videos as I can't get the type of service Mivid provides for free that I would get on other paid sites.  The most amazing thing about Mivid.net is that there is NO cap on quality so your hd movies will come out fantastic (I recommend 720p for filesize but you can use 1080p if you want).

Temporarily close Quick Launch:<br>  Right-click on the Taskbar, click Toolbars, deselect Quick Launch<br>  3. Open My Computer<br>  Right-click on C:<br>  Click Properties<br>  Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.<br>  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)<br>  5. Restart. Right-click on Taskbar, click Toolbars, select Quick Launch to restore<br>  <br>  All these things should be done regularly. The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.<br>  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.<br>  <br>  Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Does a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>   <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|dILqe7nBaa	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstarted/speed.mspx?wt_svl=10073XPHa1&mg_id=10073XPHb1" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstart...</a>|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	I can't teach you the common sense to not download malicious software.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn something and not run on a horribly insecure OS, try using Ubuntu Linux instead of Windows.|`|AA11941449	you bought a new what,computer or memory stick? if its showing the cpu using 100%, then there is a program running all the time hold down the Ctrl,Alt keys then press the.Delete key,then release all three that will bring up task manager,when it comes up click the Processes tab at the top and then look at the cpu tab,scroll down the list and see what process is running and is causing the high cpu load,also it could be a virus you got somewhere.i would need more info to really pinpoint the exact cause of it,but in the mean time go to the link below download it and run the program and see if you got a virus,if you have one and it finds it,it will give you the recommended course of action to take to get rid of it.It is a fully functional 30 day free trail so give it a try.if you will email me and give me the results of the processes and what you found out about the virus i can help you out more.|`|El6bdkYBaa	buy a new pc

I couldn't use my computer for days. I tried everything to get rid of it, but no matter what I did, it just kept coming back stronger. I was so stressed out after spending multiple days trying to remove the spyware with no luck. I gave up and decided to throw in the towel. I called geek squad. They came and looked at my computer, but wanted $300 to fix it. I really didn't have that much, so I told them I couldn't afford to fix it at this time. The technician must have seen the frustration I was going through. Because he pulled me aside and told me how I could fix it for under $60. <br>  <br>  He told me to go to  <a href="http://www.honestspywarereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.honestspywarereview.com</a><br>  <br>  So I checked into it, and found the best product, AdwareAlert is also capable of removing Trojans.<br>  <br>  I quickly downloaded AdwareAlert and scanned my computer. It removed my malware infection, and also a couple spyware infections I didn't even know I had.<br>  <br>  It has kept my computer running fast, and spyware free for a couple of months now. I highly recommend it.<br>  I would suggest you give it a shot. It worked for me. So you really can't lose.

AA11065140	No, these two things are entirely unrelated.  And no, an external HD will do nothing but give you more space for storing new games & other files.|`|MxculX2Daa	Ading an external hard drive will not affect performance at all.|`|pW55qClKaa	An external hard drive will not improve the performance.  There are 3 main ways that you can fix this:<br>  Add more RAM<br>  Replace the processor with a more powerful one<br>  Replace the video card with a better one<br>  The processor doesn't seem like it's really that bad, but your RAM is pretty low.  The video card could be in need of replacement.  Compare the computers specs to the recommended specs which should be somewhere on the box of the game.|`|5poXqoXGaa	You probably need for a better video card. External HD will not increase performance, only add more storage.
vFenaoM6aa	If your not technically minded, then try to look for a midi file of the song you want. search for midi "songname" download. the filename should be something like title.mid. They are pretty small in size and are a quick download. Midi files are sometimes used for background music of karaoke discs.<br>  <br>  If you are technically minded and have some sort of audio waveform edititor, then you can to an extent. Since vocals are usually recorded in mono, you would have to INVERT either the left or right channel of the stereo waveform, and paste/combine it with the opposite channel of the same waveform. Then save the single combined channel to mono, or copy the combined channel to both Left and Right Channels.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Let me get this straight.  You have a song on your computer and you want to add it to your PowerPoint presentation.  But the song features singers and you want to remove them and only play the music (accompaniment)?<br>  <br>  No. There is no way to do that.<br>  <br>  OR you want to magically get a song you have on a CD into your computer but leave the voices off?<br>  <br>  No. There is no way to do that.<br>  <br>  OR you have a song on an MP3 player and you want to copy it onto your computer to use with PowerPoint, but you don't want to include the voices?<br>  <br>  No.  There is no way to do that.<br>  <br>  So pretty much, no matter how you ask the question, the answer is always the same.<br>  <br>  Sorry

etV271ARaa	Not sure but I know if you print the document it comes out complete on an A4 page|`|jeMNcPPYaa	I don't think there is one, every object in the file is meant to be scalable.<br>  <br>  This is because orriginally the files were meant to be displayable on any viewing device, so scaled to that target by the client. That client is also meant to filter out items that do not make sense.<br>  <br>  For example text only displays would filter out graphics.<br>  <br>  I know that means less these days than it once did because even small phone displays can show graphics, but I believe that the underlying format and the engine is still the same.<br>  <br>  So when you write an adobe document you should simply create what is comfortable to view on your screen, then let the target clients arange the page as best for its own view.
