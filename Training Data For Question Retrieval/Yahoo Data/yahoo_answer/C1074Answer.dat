PJ2198Slaa	it was supposed to be christian cage but they didnt say that yet|`|09YK9Zboaa	The hit and run and attack at survivor series was Christian, the rigged pyros and the attack at the rumble were matt, those two attacks were a result of him losing the ECW title both came right after that... the two prior attacks matt had nothing to do with because he was on top just like jeff was|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Exactly he said they couldn't prove that he attacked jeff which means they could be opening this storyline for christian cage but the question is is christian going to come as a face or a heel. It's really interesting and i can't wait to see what's going to happen next.|`|Y7YuaiN1aa	yea im sure at royal rumbe he hit him with a chair and let edge win.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	no it was christian cage|`|cE8SQUEbaa	definitely...|`|6jewV8lZaa	there are no evidence that Matt was Jeff attacker. Christiaan might still be the possible attacker.|`|XlRzq8xEaa	Exactly that lead me to believe Christian could still be behind the other attacks or at least Matt's accomplice! Maybe he'll be revealed at NWO. I seriously hope Christian is going to be apart of this storyline. I'm praying for a Edge/ Matt/ Jeff/ Christian Fatal 4 way at Wrestlemania.|`|fpMYbn3Jaa	I think they know that everyone thinks its Christian, so theyre going to be drawing attention away from that fact for a while, they're still trying to play the 'could-be-anyone' angle, which is actually going pretty well. I still have no clue what to think about who it is.

7rpILeYtaa	Swagger beat Matt Hardy to retain the ECW title    Melina beat Beth Phoenix to win the Womens title    Cena beat JBL to retain the World Heavyweight title (HBK superkicked both Cena and JBL)    Edge beat Jeff Hardy to win the WWE title (Matt Hardy came out and looked liked he was helping Jeff set Edge up for Con-Chair-To, but hit Jeff with the chair giving Edge the win)    Randy Orton won the Royal Rumble Match      BQ. Heel, makes for more exciting and unpredictable storyline|`|6jewV8lZaa	Jack Swagger beat Matt Hardy with the Gutwrench Powerbomb, I think Matt cried in the end.    Melina defeat Beth Phoenix with a nice pin. Santino froze after that. Beth number 1 fan didnt show up.    John Cena defeat JBL. Shocking (sarcastic)! HBK gave the sweet chin music to both of em. John Cena won after the Throwback.    Edge defeat Jeff Hardy after Matt hit em with a steel Chair. Before the match Vickie Guererro change the match to a NO DQ. Jeff Jump off the lader onto Chavo Guererro on the announce table.    Royal Rumble Match. Santino stayed in the ring for only quarter of a second. Dolf Ziggler introduce himself to Kane and got eliminated after that. Randy Orton won after eliminating Triple H.    BQ - Matt is probably better as a heel.

So we don't really need to feel sorry.
YwpKrQOsaa	According to Sonny Vaccaro he isn't very good.    Vaccaro said that the only reason he was invited to the ABCD camp was as a favor to his father, he also said that Miller looked very out of place at the event.    USC took him as part of a package so they could get Demar DeRozan.    I personally think that he shouldn't have taken the scholarship.  He's already rich and famous also he didn't really earn his place there so he's depriving someone of the chance to play college ball and get an education or possibly even go pro.|`|LGLnItBcaa	we'll see next year. freshmen arent getting consistant play time in USC unless they're phenom material.|`|52oWf2xMaa	Well they got him because he is on the same team with Demar Derozan, their best player. It's like a package like Conley and Oden last year, they want to go to a team together.     Here is what Tim Floyd said in an interview " Last April...Percy Miller(Romeo's Dad)called while driving both players from a tournament in Fayetteville, Ark...Percy Miller said 'Demar and Romeo are ready to make their decision, and would you like to have them both on scholarship?'...'I said absolutely.'"|`|AA11488609	He is a decent player, but he is not likely to be NBA material.  One of his classmates is from his high school and is a highly touted recruit and probably twisted some arms to a little extent to get Miller into Southern Cal as well.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	Full scholarship to USC?    I thought he was 11 or something.    EDIT: Or was that Bow Wow?|`|GBGcI509aa	Both.|`|6FPpkmi6aa	Honestly I don't know. I would think he does, but I'm not sure.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Well he was starting PG on his varisty high school team.

RjQLB9s1aa	Unfortunately, there are not many people who can predict what a new racket will be like. When someone asks to predict on a second new racket - I must consult my crystal ball - LOL.    When it comes to these two new rackets, Head has produced rackets for years so the next generation will evolve from the last one. In this respect, the new "Speed Pro" will have quite a history behind it. The Adidas starts with a blank canvas. Ivan Lendl used one in the seventies but technology has moved on. Adidas pulled out of making rackets & are now returning. Whilst starting with a new canvas can be a good thing, I would try & demo each one (tennis warehouse are awesome for this) when it is released.     Take your time & make a wise decision. As much as I love adidas - I wear nothing but Adidas - I would be reluctant to buy their first edition racket. My crystal ball suggests that if you want to buy - make it a decision with your Head. If you can use your brother's racket, take your time as the old flexpoint may be the one that suits you best.

All class now.|`|R35m2LC3aa	Unless he's completely strung out, probably not.|`|AA12034105	He better not haha :P|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I don't think so...that's really not like him to do this kind of things.

VLEgFWWfaa	Yes sir the best rival in football is the Redskins and Cowboys yes sir.    Yes sir no team ever sweeps another team except for the skins in 2005 yes sir.    Yes Sir the Skins and Cowboys are typically evenally matched teams and in the mid 20th century the Redskins voted against the Cowboys becoming a team which instantly triggered a hateful rivalry yes sir.     Yes sir Thank you for this oppurtunity Yes sir.|`|epHvdGIbaa	patriots and colts|`|ZajNdyfYaa	Yes Sir the best rival in football is the Patriots and Colts rivalry . it is always so heated and a tense scene.|`|msxGICJvaa	1.

Violent player outbursts, fan fights.  Even coaches and owners despise each other|`|rNUyV1EYaa	I would say Cowboys and Redskins is the best rivalry.

AA12034105	Yeah I thought the same thing :(  I thought Rafa would get the special treatment when he became  1 but nope the organisers still favour Fed !!|`|WwZpEFg5aa	Its a pity that money pays everything even in games.  But Nadal is much better than Fed!  Go Nadal|`|KF2yg9Ovaa	i don't think it's purposeful...it's just the way the draw works out|`|8rasqlUgaa	how long nadal been ranking number 1??? Nadal has been number one for only several months. federer has been number 1 for 5 years and always like that.|`|xLyNsywiaa	I know what you mean, coupled with the heat, the scheduling, the AO seems to be the worst GS out of the four...|`|b994a4f27ea4a38742bd550caa568bbdaa	because as long as nadal is  1 and federer is  2 they will always play in finals because nadal will be at the top of the draw and federer will be at the bottom.  In pro tennis the  1 &  2 seeds will be on opposite sides of the draw.  After that there is some weird formula that fill in the rest of the draw.  So, the  3 player could end up in the semi's vs. the  1 player, instead of the  2 like a normal draw works.  don't know why federer got to rest an extra day being the  2 seed.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	these 2 r best players|`|JEMtVVkBaa	It would not have been any different if it was Tsonga, Roddick, Gasquet, Gonzalez, Hewitt, Safin, Baghdatis....anyone!    thats the way its planned. Someone has to have a longer break between semi's and the final otherwise someone would have to play their Quarter Final and their Semi Final on Back to back days.    If it was any other way, then it would be a 15 day tournament insted of 14 - which means there is a rest day on day 14 which is pointless and expensive!|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	they dont do it on purpose. first of all, fed always started second(as do all the  1 seeds cuz they get a bye for the first couple of rounds). this, then causes their whole schedual to be messed up. fed got rest only cuz ther were no delays in his matches, and cuz all his matches were short. would u be saying this if nadal had all easy 3 setters?? no. n e way, like i said NOTHING IS FIXED IN THE DRAWS|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I know, it's unfair, isn't it? I don't expect Rafa to be too tired though, besides he knows how to play Fed and he'll win in 4... :-D|`|6d66238ecdb341312bfda5184a522ba7aa	An excellent point!  Too many tennis matches are affected (potentially) by the fact that one of the two players has had a day off to recover before the match and the other hasn't.     They should always make the two games who's winners will meet in the next round at least start at the same time, in every round, even if it means you lose the chance to see both semi-finals in full live.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	I noticed that too and assumed it was because Roger is older and needs more time to recover. Har har just kidding.    I vaguely recall it having something to do with the previous tournament, but your right Roger has more time to rest and after last night Nadal will need all her can get.|`|xlktQ8Y5aa	Because he's Roger Federer. Show some respect.
U7BkuEU9aa	The women's final's tomorrow morning in the Americas and Europe or tonight if you're in Australia. Rafa and Fed take the court the same time on Sunday:    7.30pm Australia  9.30am Spain  8.30am GMT  6.30am Rio  3.30am EST  12.30am PST|`|XtZxAyZSaa	i wish federer wins hopefully

BUT IF THIS WAS A CRACK COCAINE ON A POLE MATCH, JEFF WOULD WIN EASILY      VIAGRA is an oral medication for erectile dysfunction (ED). It helps most men with ED improve their erections. That means they are able to achieve harder erections.    Getting an erection is only half the story  Maintaining an erection is just as important as getting one. VIAGRA can help with both. This can lead to a more satisfying sexual experience with your partner.    Who can take VIAGRA  VIAGRA has an established safety profile of over 10 years. It has been shown to work safely and effectively in men with ED. This includes:    * Men of all ages  * Men who have difficulty all the time or just some of the time  * Men with other health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression    What is erectile dysfunction?  ED is when a man has problems getting or maintaining an erection long enough for sex. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis.    ED isnt the same for all men. Some men arent able to get an erection at all. Others can get one, but its not hard enough for sex. And others get a hard erection but lose it before or during sex.    ED is a medical condition. So in most cases, erections will not improve without treatment.    A common issue  ED is more common than you might think. More than half of all men over 40 have some difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. The fact is, guys at any age can experience ED.    Treatment works  If you think you might have ED, theres something you can do. Ask your doctor about treatment. Most men with ED can significantly improve their erections. And better erections can mean better sex.    Find out if VIAGRA is right for you. Speak to your doctor. He can tell you if you have ED. And can recommend an effective treatment.|`|0P40aUA0aa	Jeff Hardy for sure      Ladder Match Or TLC|`|BMn7l54Haa	Jeff Hardy.

WE DON'T WANT HIM HERE ANYMORE.!!!!            --------------------------------------...|`|1upNmVySaa	Probably.|`|1TJuKNQvaa	Yes I think that he wants to come back because he sees how good the Lakers are doing with their players, and he wants to be a part of another championship.|`|o5CFB1c1aa	No, but I think he's beginning to be more humble. Few realize He is the fire starter that have a lot of people thinking Kobe is the cry baby. The Big cry baby!! (Shaq)|`|AA11869131	It would be like rehiring a former post office worker who went postal!     Hell2theNO!|`|KkOJD0Cxaa	Hopefully yes|`|7t7XzXsVaa	Shaq would do much better in phoenix|`|uxregJ0faa	He knows his time is coming to retire. Now he realizes that Kobe was a main piece of winning those championships. Same when he had Dwayne. O well Shaq too bad      Yea there was a little feud between the two but they coo now. The media hyped it up|`|XrCc85kNaa	He is sucking up...  But I dont mind...I love Shaq...    BQ: YES....there was a feud....but it got blown out of proportion by the media...  It has cooled down now though...|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	He said he wants to so maybe he wants to end his career as a Laker. Ofcourse there's a feud. If he comes back maybe there will be a sHaq-Bynum feud too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0KWAxxzZ...|`|8qyofB7Zaa	Going to the Lakers would greatly improve his chances of winning a championship compared to staying in Phoenix, but at this point in his career what else does he have to prove? He already has 4 championships and is one of the all time greats. Winning a 5th would mean he breaks the tiebreaker over Duncan but it would likely be as a backup to Bynum rather than as a star player. As you noted he contradicts himself as it seems like just yesterday he "rapped" about Kobe. Shaq just likes to talk a lot, and it happens he's in a "reconcillatory" mood right now. I think he'll retire in a year or two as a Sun.|`|P93I8CHtaa	i really doubt that,maybe shaq will head out to the east before trade deadline again|`|PcxUNztLaa	Of course...with Kobe he averaged like 28 PPG and 3peated....with everyone else he Sucks......    Kobe MADE Shaq a dominant Center!|`|GBGcI509aa	I hope he comes back|`|56Mb4BXIaa	SHAQ is too old now, to be completely honest, LA wouldn't take him for free. Lakers want young and healthy guys.....there is no way shaq age 36 is gonna come to LA.|`|fz77R5Jmaa	i would LOVE to see that!|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Probably.|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Shaq just wants to be the biggest star there is. If they can work their obvious differences they would be unstoppable once again togather. I would love to see that. Yet, this a possibility really far out any chance of becoming  a reality. As for "?f he wants to do it".......I might be inclined to say yes because What could be bigger news than that? Shaq always goes for the biggest news; So who knows really? I will say this: If Marc Cuban was in charge of that trade decision, he would do it. They changes everything like that. See ya later guys!!!
4V6V9uN8aa	Damn good question, Great comparison...  I personally liked Jacqueline better from her early days in WCW to her time in WWF/E & as a manager for Beer Money, Inc. over in TNA.  Ivory's career really ended while she was in her prime.  Still, she was one of the best underrated stars/divas in all of WWE.  She is not given true credit for her role in keeping the Women's division alive at a time when Vince McMahon had made plans to scrap the division after Chyna quit the federation over not being given a World Title shot.  As dominant as Chyna was, Ivory was the only diva to give Chyna could not truly dominate.      For skill & ability, I would vote for Ivory, but overall, Jacqueline, the Pride of Tennessee is still the WOMAN!!!!|`|G9LSZQcaaa	Jacqueline|`|0P40aUA0aa	ivory|`|0xGm3lrxaa	That's hard to decide. Both were great. I remember when Jacqueline beat Chavo for the Cruiserweight title. That was a great match. I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed Ivory's feuds too. They were brutal and full of cat fights.|`|QOW6a3mKaa	I'll have to say Ivory. Jaqueline was over looked because she was big and [no offence] black|`|zVbfANUeaa	ivory was better|`|7AgWtSbHaa	depends on who will win i guess but you cant compare them from different eras that's like comparing fruit with meat which is more fat in them|`|ZRIqT3J9aa	Jackie|`|6u2YkXjlaa	i thought that ivory was better
v77SnunOaa	Yes!|`|nfCH7nkTaa	it all depends on where the other free agents go that year, most likely lebron will go to the team with the best supporting cast, which could very likely be the cavaliers|`|Ga5QdZoXaa	No.  He's on his way to Chicago if the bulls are interested in signing him  He grew up as a Bulls fan|`|kTbCarenaa	please|`|3OV4Pl64aa	if he wins a 'ship with the cavs then no  otherwize maybe|`|56Mb4BXIaa	he is not going to new york, because his team is wining games. Cavs are gonna make a big move (trade) to surround Lebron with a great supporting cast. Probably Cleavland will try to get bosh, but i highly doubt that Lebron is going anywhere.     If anything, cleavland is gonna get a better center, or pf.|`|XrCc85kNaa	No...  I think the Cavs are doing a good job surrounding him with talent...    I would be surprised if he leaves..|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Well no he's not ending up going to the Knicks and lose all hope of winnign a ring.|`|1f60cd236744da3f80d9d6fa54fe4bfcaa	no.

Getting an erection is only half the story  Maintaining an erection is just as important as getting one. VIAGRA can help with both. This can lead to a more satisfying sexual experience with your partner.    Who can take VIAGRA  VIAGRA has an established safety profile of over 10 years. It has been shown to work safely and effectively in men with ED. This includes:    * Men of all ages  * Men who have difficulty all the time or just some of the time  * Men with other health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression    What is erectile dysfunction?  ED is when a man has problems getting or maintaining an erection long enough for sex. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis.    ED isnt the same for all men. Some men arent able to get an erection at all. Others can get one, but its not hard enough for sex. And others get a hard erection but lose it before or during sex.    ED is a medical condition. So in most cases, erections will not improve without treatment.    A common issue  ED is more common than you might think. More than half of all men over 40 have some difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. The fact is, guys at any age can experience ED.    Treatment works  If you think you might have ED, theres something you can do. Ask your doctor about treatment. Most men with ED can significantly improve their erections. And better erections can mean better sex.    Find out if VIAGRA is right for you. Speak to your doctor. He can tell you if you have ED. And can recommend an effective treatment.|`|ppRbL18eaa	ive always hated jbl....|`|fmUGHvgHaa	jbl is not cool enough to shrunk maria
krB6hWIeaa	Nope, people like Al Jefferson deserve it way more than David West.  In my opinion, Ray Allen and Vince Carter deserved it more than Paul Pierce.  Allen Iverson? No way, he shouldn't even be a reserve this season to be honest.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Jameer Nelson should not have been in there. and you can make a case for Ray Allen and Al Jefferson being on the teams. other than that, i think the fans got it right.|`|LsIMKcHcaa	It's not fair.

tDKBsiSkaa	Forget the sidestroke...learn breastroke...that, too, is a legal stroke for the test and much faster and efficient.  I once beat the 16 males taking the navy seal swim test when I was 26 doing this.  The first to finish was two minutes behind me.   The Snr Chief and ex navy seal was struck dumb.  In fact, on their point scale, my time was faster than they accounted for.  Also, a tip to the wise....learn from a professional outside the Navy....those freaks actually train you to drown.  When I taught proper technique, they demanded I stop.  "That is not their way to do things"  Good luck and fight for your lifejacket....they do not provide enough for the entire crew.  Sad, but true.|`|EJn3K9zjaa	Make sure when you take the arm part of the stroke you get full extension with your arms, keeps your fingers together through out the pull and try and catch the water with your wrists and arms as well as you hands on the pull. If the swim is without boots then try and keep you feet pointed to make your kick as long as possible.  Hope this helps

Half of you TCs will migrate to baseball or another sport section, while the rest of you end up in Mens Health or Polls & Surveys........ most of you won't return next year with the same yahoo id because of suspension & you will say "wow, they give out TC badges for chatting in the football section" & then you will think that THIS YEAR wasn't as fun as the previous year.|`|DPlJiWyWaa	It becomes like the baseball section is now, very dead.  The questions you'll see though are like "Who will the Cowboys draft this offseason?" and "Will Brett Favre Retire?".  It gets just as annoying as it is now.  I plan to stay though.|`|4e5b4896d3758b051623a078b2e188f8aa	There will be a ton of draft speculation, talk about free agents moving around, and early predictions for next season.  We'll also hear from fans of whoever wins this Sunday's game, since they'll have bragging rights until next season.    I don't mind the offseason discussion if it's about player movement, but the predictions and guesses towards next year's Super Bowl are annoying.  Same for the mock drafts.....if we want more of those, we can just Google them because there are a million out there.|`|RS3fjNboaa	I couldn't hardly be in here at all, it was so bad. I would only come in if one of my contacts asked a question. I'll be asking a few in the off season and I hope my contacts answer. It's a good way to keep in touch until preseason gets here.    Actually, there are a few users in here I plan on making contacts, so I don't lose track of them over the off season.|`|XrCc85kNaa	It gets annoying...  Especially with bragging and prediction questions..    Also...  They will ask about which free agent will go to which team...  -------------------  lol...yeah...just when you think it cant happen...  The impossible happens...(it gets more annoying)    There are also more trolls than usual....|`|7V79OMMHaa	No, they just ask all kinda of stupid questions, and around the time the season starts up later on this year a guy named "lsuballs" comes around and messes with people on their questions. He is pretty clever though, but once the season starts he goes away.    Also, since when did you start referring to fools as clowns? That's what I do!    LOL @ The Heckler!      Stay Cool|`|6tGYe5roaa	I was here last year and I had to take time away from here because this place just got annoying. If you were on last night for all the trolling, just picture that times 10. The space between the Superbowl and the draft, it just gets weird in here.    How? Were you the one making the fake accounts of other users?    Oh, got ya! It probably would have eventually happened anyway. The exact same thing started happening last year as well.

Thats more then the average question      Nope  If I buy tickets to the Game, I always go  Giants games, for my family, we have to plan like 2 months ahead of the game    I only get to go to 2-4 a year    But one time I could not get to the game beucase my dad had to go down to So Cal for the Weekend, and I could not get there  And it was Giants/Dodgers on the Brick wall in Right field  But I was never tired|`|2wgEsVmsaa	And yet, look at all the answers to his questions.

Yeah, I live in Philadelphia and we wanted to go see a Red Sox game (My family loves them). I am very lucky since at the time I was being coached by the guy who coached David Oritz in the Dominican Republic. We went to the hotel where the Red Sox were staying and we were allowed inside their room.    Let me tell you, David Ortiz's girlfriend is H-O-T! In his room (Which BTW was HUGE) was Willy Mo Pena and Manny Ramirez (Not as big as he looks, Ortiz is bigger). Willy was getting a haircut (Yup, inside the room!) while Manny and David ate. Those guys each ate a whole Chicken!    Anyway, enough about that. When we went home we all agreed to get some rest (since we had huge practice that morning) and then we would all meet up at the Stadium. I fell asleep at home and woke up when the game was in the 3rd inning.     I ended up watching the rest of the game at home while my brothers and my little cousin plus my teammates were enjoying themselves at the stadium.|`|pVHAh6hTaa	X is a great man and is trying to be funny.  i support X.  lighten up.|`|EPVW8Ukeaa	Wait who is X?

2N6oTOLQaa	Wes T is correct.    First, a wild pitch is not scored as an error, it is kept as a different stat category. Same goes for pass balls for catchers.    The error counts like any other defensive error. It doesn't automatically mean there are no more earned runs that inning, but IF the error makes a run unearned, then it doesn't matter whether it was committed by the pitcher or by any other defensive player.     The idea is that the pitcher's ERA is based on how well he pitches, not how well he fields his position. A run caused by a pitcher's error is no more a reflection of the pitcher's ability than a run caused by another fielder's error.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Depends on the error. If it is a throwing or fielding error that allows the runner to reach base or extends the inning, then it would be an unearned run. But a wild pitch, which is scored as an error on the pitcher, does not lead to the run being unearned.    Edit: My mistake. I'm not sure why I had thought that. I knew a WP couldn't lead to an unearned run, as it could make pitchers throw the ball away to preserve their ERA.|`|y9vqyqeNaa	No.|`|JD3yWKNGaa	I don't think so.|`|jKOB7n35aa	It does not, and if there were 2 outs in that inning and a few more runs crossed the plate none of them would be earned either.    EDIT: And a wild pitch is not scored as an error on the pitcher, nor is a passed ball scored as an error on the catcher.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Once the pitcher pitches the ball he becomes a fielder just like the other eight players so his error would be no different then say the shortstops error.  Most of the time it would be an unearned run but there could be a case where it is an earned run.      If the error resulted in the loss of an out then it will be unearned.  However if the error simply gave the runner or a batter an extra base then it may be earned.  For example the batter hits a little dribbler in front of the plate and the pitcher fields the ball and throws it pass the first baseman allowing the batter to get to second.  If the official scorer thinks the batter would have beat it out even with a good throw then he will give the batter a single and an error to the pitcher for allowing him to get to second.  Then if the next batter hits a home run then both runs would be earned because the previous batter would have scored from first or second so the error becomes irrelevent.|`|gOnqdQWWaa	Yes, because they were the one who made the error so it is an earned run.

AA11570394	With the 30-30 you will be limited to much less range than the 06. So if you see a nice buck 300 yards away you should pass with the 30-30 shot whereas the 06 will work.  But under 200 yards with the right ammo the 30-30 works fine.  I would go with the 30-06.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	30-30 is is excellent for closer range.... 125 yards..    30-06 is best for longer shots -- over 125 yards.....    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.30_WCF    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.30-06_Spri...|`|K5AeQuSNaa	As the other posters have said, it depends on the range.  If you can only get one rifle though, I would go with the .30-06.  It covers a wider range of game, and has a longer accurate range.|`|nooi0ldjaa	if your hunting in the woods most of the time, 30-30  (150 yard shots max)    if your hunting fields or plains most of the time, 30-06  (300-350 yard shots avg)    both rifles are good deer rifles, if your recoil shy stick with the 30-30, if recoil is no big deal, i would chose the 06...remember with the 06 if you chose you can move up to bigger game such as bear or moose. not a good idea with a 30-30.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The 30-06 is your best choice.* Greater maximum effective range, Greater variety of bullet weights to choose from, Can be used on a greater variety of Big or Small Game than the 30-30.*|`|xOReEw6Waa	I bought my first 30-06 when I was 14 and have never been without one. I hunt in North Idaho where the brush has to be some of the worst in the country and I've never had a problem using the "aught six" from 25 feet to 300+ yards. Comparing the 30-30 and the 30-06 really isn't fair, because I always go for a rifle I know will hit 300 yards with no difficulties, the 100 yards are a gimme.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I'd recommend the '06.  The reason, you can shoot a deer at 50 yards with a 30-06, but you can't shoot one at 300 yards with a 30-30.  If the recoil is too severe (I doubt that it will be, I started at 12 years old with my 30-06), Remington makes some reduced recoil ammo.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	If all of your hunting is going to be in terrain that limits you to say 150yards being a very long shot get the .30-30. If the country is more open or you plan on hunting elk, bear or moose with this rifle get the .30-06.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	If you're only going to get one, I'd go with the .30-06. (The sound you hear is my Winchester .30-30 whimpering in the safe.) The .30-30 is a great gun for heavy brushy areas, shots under 150 yards, and if you need to make quick shots. The .30-06 is better in open areas, longer shots (200-300 yards is common), and has a lot more power. But the real selling point for the '06 is that the ammo is available in lots of loads and bullet sizes, including some reduced recoil cartridges for beginners and smaller shooters.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	30-06 is better for long-range shots such as open fields.  The bullets have a higher velocity and they have pointed tips; enabling better accuracy and a flatter trajectory.  The 30-06 is more accurate than most shooters; especially when shooting without a rest.  It also has plenty of knockdown power; and can be used for everything from deer to moose/elk, etc with the right bullets.    30-30 is better for short-medium deep woods hunting.  The lever-actions chambered in 30-30 are usually short barreled, quick handling, and capable of firing quick shots with reasonable accuracy.  With their mild recoil, they are a lot of fun to use in the deep woods.  They are not as accurate as the 30-06 due to the round/flat nose ammunition necessary for their tube magazines (to prevent chain-reaction detonation of tipped bullets against the primers of the other cartridges)  Hornady leverevolution bullets are the only exception to this.  Also, the 30-30 has a lower velocity than the 30-06 so longer range shots have more of an arch and the bullet will have less power when it gets there.  I wouldn't shoot at a deer beyond 150-200 yards with a 30-30.  But for shooting deer at closer ranges, I love using the 30-30.|`|szkrumAJaa	Both will do.|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	I'd use a 30-06.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	Both very effective - 30-30 good for brush and heavy timber areas 30-06 long range shots.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	For the most part .30/30 is seen as a woodland forest cartridge where ranges are short.  Since most 30/30 are lever rifle and by design are forced to use flat point bullets.    The .30-06 is looked at as a plains or mountain gun.  The fact it can use Spitzer style bullets lends itself to longer range shooting.  The .30-06 is more than capable of taking deer anywhere and is a more versatile cartridge than the .30/30 Winchester.    So it boils down to where you plan to hunt & finding a rifle you like and whether it can be had in .30/30 or .30-06.|`|rWYp4ekeaa	If hunting in thick cover then the 30-30   if open field then 30-06|`|eIlQN7XFaa	Rifle cost, shooter ability, range to target, what animal your hunting, and ammunition cost are all questions you need to answer or at least be aware of before you purchase. The rule of thumb is to get the largest caliber you can shoot accuratly and comfortably. I have both calibers. The 30-30 and the 30-06 are both great guns but they are very different.  Winchester 30-30.       This round is cheaper(see the C.T.D. website provided) at $13.79 for a box of 20 or .68 cents a pop. The Federal ammunition website(provided) considers this caliber suitable for the following medium game. with a 150 gr. bullet for the largest (*Keep in mind that bullet type, range to target, and bullet weight will not be the same for all game.) [Antelope, wild Boar, Standard deer, Trophy whitetail, Mule Deer, Black bear, Caribou, elk, and moose.]  30-06 Springfield    For a box of 20 (on the CTDsite) this will run you $16.61 or .83 cents a pop. The Federal ammunition website lists this caliber suitable for "large heavy game" and will take the following animals using a 180 gr bullet for the largest. [Antelope, wild Boar, mountain goat, Standard deer, Trophy whitetail, Mule Deer, Bighorn sheep, Black bear, Caribou, elk, moose, Bison, and brown bear.]     There is such thing as not enough gun(22lr for a grizzly) and on the other end there is also the problem of to much gun.(50 cal for varmit hunting) Depending on the kind of game you are considering taking, cost per round, and probable range you will be shooting I would go with a 30-06. It offers a longer range and harder punch for larger animals and will cover a larger variety in case you decide to go for bear and not just deer. The cost per round is not that much more for the added ability. I am including a site to academy sporting goods store so you can check out the rifles and pricing. Good luc and let us know what yo get.|`|AQhJJT91aa	If you are starting out at hunting I would get a 30-30. Honestly, if this is your first gun, I would get a .223.  It is a wonderful gun that doesn't kick bad yet will encourage proper shot placement.  Once you have mastered it at deer hunting you can use it to varmit hunt or let your kids use it.  A 30-06 will kick so bad to a newby that it will make you scared to pull the trigger and yank the gun, close your eyes or refrain from taking the shot when you have that one chance.|`|t3y5PxKGaa	the 30-06 is better as far as strength and distance

Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either.

fKAnnQeWaa	This is a very good question but it involves more of Social Studies than what it does baseball.     You see, the United States does not have an original nationality (Unless you count the Native Americans but even they came across the Ice Bridge) There is no such thing as "white" or "black" involving races. Many people come from different countries and establish themselves here.    Europeans are what make the "white" in this country. Africans are what make the "black" in this country. So in a way, the USA does not have an original nationality.    Now what the USA does have is diversity. That is why I, a Dominican, consider it the best country in the world. This country is just a huge melting pot where a bunch of races just mix eachother up and make Americans.    Any player can play for a team as long as they have some decent from that country. For example, Ian Snell is going to play for Puerto Rico since he has some heritage in him.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	One thing I hate about the WBC, is players can choose what team they want to play for, they should be made what team they were born in. So in other words, if you were born in Mexico you should play for Mexico.|`|AA12250406	I guess but then again in all honesty the Mexican team would be fielded by Americans, so It's kinda not the same. Plus,Native born Mexicans really don't like Mexican-Americans. They call them some name or something like that. I have a friend who is Mexican and he told me about that. I just think in my own opinion, you play for the country you were born and raised in.|`|vct8ksWcaa	maybe if your parents where born outside of the U S

If you're ahead of everyone, definitely go for the fast break. For when you're surrounded, you can call time-out, but I wouldn't recommend that unless it's late in the game and the possesion is real important. For a drill, i guess you can just practice dribbling for about 10 ft, stop, pivot, and dribble again. Probably not the best drill, but it should work.    hope this helps

Second of all it seems like you don't want any opposing positions to your own which defeats the purpose of asking a question.    Third of all, any team that makes it to the Super Bowl has proven they can win on any given Sunday. The Pittsburgh offense sucks. If Kurt turns it on they could beat Pitt.|`|1YrHkxKvaa	not only do they have a chance, they are going to win, FOR AMERICA!!!|`|AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     PREDICTION: CARDINALS with the points and the OVER, score: Cardinals 31-Steelers 24. , MVP: Warner|`|nAJGf6DWaa	Steelers Defense is not unstoppable..........the colts and titans demolished ur secondary|`|ZlXK9TEQaa	I AM A BEARS FAN, WHO WOULD WIN $20 IF STEELERS WIN BUT:    Zona- 23  Pit-13    Write it in stone|`|I8laNaM8aa	dont be surprised if they do win ok you still see the cards for what they were but so did the panthers and falcons which whom also very good backs and were ousted also good defenses. dont you think that the cards dont know they can pass on the steelers like the colts and titans did. that will keep troy in check and second cars do know how to pick off passes. and again pitt has nagging injuries to its best players and arrizona is the fresher team troy gets hurt your done parker goes down your done and well ward is already hurt  and dont think that pit is invincible i like them but im not going to say that they cant be beat cause that they can.|`|xaP8Orr5aa	Each team has an equal chance it all comes down to the final seconds|`|6SIjchQUaa	On any given Sunday!!!!!|`|aaKYVMk2aa	I'm a Steelers fan but goddamit, I mean, ala, damn it.

We had a team full of ESPN highlight showboats with by far the most talent, and they had less talented players that played as a team. Guess what? They beat us. Also 10 years ago in my opinion was when basketball was at its worst. Everyone knew MJ and Duke were going to get every call in the book going their way. Neither of those teams needed the extra help, but they got it. The same with the Lakers a few years ago when they played the Kings. Kobe slams the ball to the floor and nothing is called. C-Web does it and it is a technical foul. As for Nash, I think he is a great player, but I think Kobe should've been MVP last year, and this year I think Chris Bosh (yes Chris Bosh) deserves it. After all he is turning the Raptors arounds.

dOpKsNYcaa	The same reason why the US Open is played in August (the hottest month of the year in New York). School is out then and they generate more revenue that way. Also, the January date for the Aussie Open doesn't conflict with any other major sports events going on in that country so it becomes the biggest sports even in Australia at that time. It's all about money!     Imagine if the US Open was played during the same timeframe as the Superbowl and the NBA championships. Now also imagine that it was during the school months and not during the summer holiday. Do you think any of those events would make nearly the same amount of money? Of course not!     They are not going to change the date of the Aussie Open! Even moving it back just a few weeks means that kids will be back in school and not at the tournament, they don't have ball kids anymore, they are competing with other national sports at that time for ratings and ultimately making half as much money.     The solution to the calander problem isn't moving the Aussie Open date, it's amending their extreme heat policy; ie: not starting matches outdoors if the temperature is over a certain level and closing the roofs beforehand (when the weather is forcast above a certain temperature), not during the middle of a match played in 112 degrees!.    The solution to the heavy schedule is also simple and doesn't involved changing the date of the Aussie Open. They just make the season shorter by eliminating (or reducing the tier status of) tennis events played after the month of october.     The Masters Cup/Sony Ericcson Championships should be played no later than the first week in November and signify the end of the tennis season, which would give players almost two full months of off-season. With the exception of the season ending championships, most people don't even really care about tennis anymore after the US Open has ended! So why not just end the season sooner?    Davis Cup/Fed Cup should be played every two years, not annually! And they should alternate between years so that they are not competing with each other. In addition to freeing up the schedules of top players it would also generate more buzz and excitment for Davis Cup/Fed Cup by making them more prestigious events.|`|uHyNuUHSaa	That's exactly what I was thinking, I think that's pretty ridiculous..|`|KR3IvxNwaa	to interests more tourists.|`|JEMtVVkBaa	I think the current spread is excellent.

xOReEw6Waa	Most hunting scopes are in the 3x9 40mm range these days, I have a 50mm and 44mm AO on my 30-06 and 300WSM. Leupold,Nikon, some Burris scopes are usually what most people like and for good reason. I personally like a very simple reticule with no mid dots and no Bullet Drop Compensation because I know my weapons and practice often. I always sight in Zero at 200 yards because at 100 yards you are usually only 1.75 inches high, and at 300 yards you are between 3 and 7 inches low. Since I hunt in a variety  of terrain I need my 200 and 300 yard shots to be dependable and the 100 is a given. You can spend extra money on all the bells and whistles but you really don't need them in a hunting situation. Always use a good BONDED bullet for deer and other big game animals. I reload so I get to pick better bullets than average,but most factory loads at 150 to 180 and above work fine. I wouldn't hesitate to take a 300+ yard ethical shot  on an elk given the chance with 165 Accubonds from Nosler.  http://www.rifleshootermag.com/ballistic...|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The most common off the shelf everybody has one scope is a 3-9X40MM....... I start at 75 yards using a paper target on a huge sheet of butchers paper in case the scopes real off.... Then work up to 100 yards....  This in my opinion is fine for deer to 125 to 150 yards......    For longer ranges surely consider 4-12X40MM magnification.....    Leupold scopes are nice and the Nikon's have decent quality for the budget minded......|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	If you're primarily still-hunting in woods, I'd suggest something along the lines of 1.75-6x or 2-7x. If you're primarily stand-hunting or hunting in more open areas, 3-9x may be preferable.  You'll want to chronograph your load, if you can, and do a little research on "maximum point blank range." It takes a bit of work, but that's the appropriate range at which to zero.|`|bkhvdfJxaa	depends if your terrian...thick woods or open plains...more info on area of hunt would be nice...  for the scope...i agree on the 3x9...probably at150yd range....thats the most practical distance that most people have shot deer at...especially since its in the woods...|`|TEAKcA5Laa	try a nikon prostaff zeroed 1 1/2 inches high at 100 yards. good to 300 yards on deer size targets with no hold over.|`|NN4lnWYEaa	Nikon Buckmaster 4.5-14 x 40 with bdc is what i got on my 30-06. Range it at 100 yds then you are covered till 500 yds with simple circle hold at the rifle scope reticle.I highly recomend to put good bases and rings for durability and holds your zero.|`|7a12de476870e2b442c9dc6e7662bf84aa	A simple 4x scope sighted in at 200 yds. will suffice on a .30-06.  As time goes by and you become more proficient with it you might want to step up to variable like a 2-7, 3-x9, 4-12, etc.  The 4x will do anything you can do to start with and won't need any adjusting when the time comes to make a shot.  Nothing personal here but the fact that your asking this question tells me that you're not ready for a variable scope or long distance shooting so get the basics and practice as much as you can.  I prefer Leupold scopes myself but I have a 4x Tasco that cost me $10.00 30 years ago and it's been on 5 or 6 .30-06s through the years and it still shoots fine.  Get a ballistics chart for the 06' and it'll tell you the drop for different bullet weights at different ranges.  But leave the long shots to the pros, they usually end up wounding animals so they die a slow death.  Practice on pie plates, if you can hit it than that's your safe range on game animals.|`|kMZMFaeHaa	i have a 3-9x40 bushnell elite 3200 on my .270. its a great scope for most conditions

If you can only pick from Carr and Harrington (tough decision, their both inconsistent), then I would go with Harrington. If it is only for one week though, I would consider David Carr, as next week he faces the Oakland Raiders, while Harrington faces Jacksonville. Hope this helped you out!

4b7a1d3375158a38235c966ee7c970adaa	Hines Ward is a stud; there is a reason you made him a high draft pick and dound Henderson on the waiver wire or free agent list.  Ward will be back this week and Big Ben has been playing much better so expect big points from Ward.  Henderson will see less time with Colston back and even less if Horn plays too.  Count on the #1 option (Ward); not the number 3, 4, or 5 option.|`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	Henderson.<br>  <br>  Joe Horn is hurt, so Henderson should see his fair share of looks.  And he's definitely their big play WR these days: 108.8 yards and 27.2 YPC in his last five games, along with 4 TDs.<br>  <br>  Ward is still doubtful to play, and the Steelers aren't a big passing team most weeks anyway.|`|7c5d28c1b3cd866e3b81116d3a95d615aa	Ward may not be 100% but Big Ben has NO ONE else worth a squat to throw to.  He'll get alot of looks.<br>  <br>  Henderson will get looks also.  So will, Reggie, Colston, Karney (where did HE come from), Deuce, Copper... And Brees throws to EVERYONE.  Devery may not get much FFL scoring.<br>  <br>  Start Ward if you want sure points.<br>  Henderson if you like to gamble.|`|AA10498287	go with henderson for sure .... horn is OUT and colston isn't at 100%<br>  <br>  ward has been hurt and his teammates have been playing well.|`|AA10860202	Go with DeVery, he has the better QB and is 100% healthy.|`|c5838760d37283cb950edb99cb4e1c45aa	I say go with Henderson no matter what.  He has been hot lately and Ward has not.  Just ride the hot hand.

Put your back foot on the tail. <br>  ?  3) Squat, so you can spring yourself up. <br>  ?  4) Kick your back foot down so you can pop as you jump up, your front foot should rub upward on your griptape. <br>  ?  5) Make sure you tuck your knees to your chest, picking up your back foot as well to level the board at a good height. REMEMBER you are jumping forward. <br>  ?  6) Then come down comfortably, both feet on the board. It will look better if both your feet are over the bolts as well as lessen the stress of impact <br>  ?  7) Finally bend your legs as you touch down to give it that smooth style and roll away stocked.

8650c0d70e14754c5e748d0c4e1ac0a6aa	I have been coaching youth soccer for a few years and I have to teach this every year.  The proper way to kick a ball is to use your instep (laces of the shoe).  Do not toe poke the ball.  <br>  <br>  First you need to have a good approach that is at a slight angle and not straight on to the ball.  As you approach the ball set/plant the non kicking leg next to and just behind the ball and make sure you have a full follow through with the kicking leg.  This will drive the ball up into the air.  <br>  <br>  If you want to make a cross from the left or right touchline/sideline you need to turn the hip and move it toward the center of the field.   <br>  <br>  Another thing to get some power behind the ball is to come off your planted leg as you follow through and land on your kicking leg.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing is practice, practice, practice.<br>  <br>  Look at the following link for tips on kicking and other soccer skills.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://expertfootball.com/training/kicking.php" rel="nofollow">http://expertfootball.com/training/kicki...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1cdab617dc57e91f3f3ce64cebd73c78aa	there is something that they call the tee off in soccer which is when the ball is planted on the grond you kick underneth it.|`|dk2f8ZRGaa	im actually a soccer player and i have scored goals from almost midfield..all u have to do its kinda put yourself in a curve like place the ball n place ur self kinda in a curve once u do that kick it with the inside top of your shoe like the one above said with you big toe n u'll see it rising up..and it depends how far it goes by how hard you kick it..<br>  <br>  good luck with that.. =]|`|bmXjg0j2aa	ok<br>  i had a problem there but now i resolved it<br>  <br>  kick it with the part were your big nail or how ever they call that  but dont kick it with the front thing just with your big nail and you will se it will even make a curve!!<br>  <br>  Good look champ!!!

2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Sounds like he wants real answers.

He wants to see everyone's attitudes about the team and the season, and get ideas for improvement.|`|vVqs2m6haa	Probably has to do with motivation and goal setting, do you expect to get a lot out of it or are you just there to be there. There will probably be things that reveal whether you are an individual or team player, stuff like that. My freshman year, all new players had to take a test like that, and the coach looked at it to help set team goals, coach us better, tailor the program more to our needs. It also won't look good to the coach if you don't do it, even if it is a waste of time, he might be looking to see if you are truly dedicated to the team.|`|gFvcQSiJaa	Sounds like a wack job to me.  Yeah, he probably really wants answers, but what does he plan to do with them?  Does he even know what to do with them?  And is there anything he can learn from those answers that he couldn't learn a whole lot more thoroughly by watching his players at practices?  Lotsaluck there, guy!

PrsbAjZAaa	Hard to say  no one's seen hardly anything of him in his time at Tottenham so far    and he's only made about 6 apps for Tottenham , so i think 7 mill is actualy to much , a meen he is a good player , and he even got Ronaldinho out of his place at Barca for a time so there's no doubt the lad's got talent    i think if people had seen more of him in the Prem , i'd say 7 million is more than reasonable , but with just 6 apps , 7 million could be to much , and if he turns out to be a flop at Pompy , it's 7 million down the pan.|`|Wd5BfIqDaa	no.

It's a shame Redknapp hasn't realised that. I think 5million would be a fair price for Portsmouth to pay if they are going to snap him up. Best of luck with it. I can't wait to see him get more games under his belt. Even though my friends are Tottenham fans and they don't rate him, I think he could be a real gem in the future. I also rate Birmingham's Cameron Jerome very highly. Watch this space! =)

Here in Texas, September October and November can still be very hot especially in South and West Texas where there the jack rabbits are plentiful.  The frost doesn't necessarily kill the bad ones off.  There are a few factors that contribute to not eating the rabbit.  One of the biggest ones are the parasites in the warmer months.  Squirrels are not quite as prone to this problem but it is a good practice to follow the same patterns.|`|YexYU5LRaa	They can be eaten year round as long as they are cleaned and cooked well.|`|CIWd3vJIaa	Start raising your own rabbits.  They multiply very quickly and you can eat them any time of the year.   I am serious.    I grew up eating rabbit meat, in Italy.  It is very healthy for you.

It is biblical.|`|c981080a505c06221f237c3acf97f037aa	Are you a hunter?Both are better in the winter.You got a lot of good advice and the thing about the parasites in the rabbit in the summer I remember from my Mom.I love Squirrel and Rabbit.I have never had Jack Rabbit.When I was 4or 5, 50 plus years ago she also cooked a ground hog.We needed the meat too back then.There are some churches who give out food .Also we go to a place called Gods food pantry where we live.We live on a fixed income and have no dependent children in the house so we can't get food stamps either.If you have kids you might be surprised and qualify for stamps.Good luck.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Most hunters wait till after the first frost of the fall to take and eat small game like squirrel and rabbit.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	kinda like oysters the R months generly best but not required  ,,  XXXthis is due to small wolves under the hide,,  fleas an ticks generly drop after it cools off|`|nooi0ldjaa	after a few frost's...it kills off the sick ones.

The two things that I use for this situation are snares and foot holds. Snares are the most selective trap ever built, You will need to do some reading. They are cheap and very effective. The size of the loop and height from ground dictate catch. With foot holds set it so it requires more weight than your average skunk to activate. Anyone who tells you to put it up so the skunks can't get it is wrong and certainly never seen a civet or spotted skunk, they climb very well. Also melons are favored more so by coons than skunks however skunks eat everything. Your question said hunt or trap and I have trash broke hounds, but this is another story. You will hear all kinds of bs but I live and breath to trap and tree coons and bobcats.......some fox. One more detail, skunks avoid water, coons prefer it!    It is funny I keep getting thumbs down ratings when I know my info to be accurate. I trap every night from Nov 15th to March 15th.    link to a skunk climbing a tree http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_UV9jSNGDpqU/RY...    link showing these skunks live near you www.wildlifenorthamerica.com    A good read for you..... Research studies such as Guthery and Beasoms Texas study in 1978. Demonstrating that snares are 12 times more selective than any other method

KJWxqQHiaa	1.) What are you're favorite lures?    I love spinnerbaits & plastic worms. Spinnerbaits because, you fish 'em fast, and they work virtually anywhere. And plastic worms because, they catch a lot of fish, and they work everywhere too. I just got a new spinnerbait too, a Strike King Mini-Spinnerbait, soon to try it out. Down size the baits for winter to catch fish. That SK mini shore looks like a dandy! For plastic worms, Zoom or Culprit ones rigged texas style, in grape or purple color works great.    2.) Why can't i catch bass on crankbaits and stuff like that?    By, "stuff like that" i think you mean poppers, stick baits, prop baits, crankbaits, etc. To be a better crankbait fisherman, you just need to practice, practice, and practice. Pick up a cheap, but reliable crank like the Bomber Model A, for $4.69. Good bait. You''ll get the hang of it, try different depths, cover, retrieve speeds, and bump them off of a lot of cover, da bass love it.    Hey, you need any more Q's, send me an email with your Questions and I'll be glad to answer 'em.|`|FmAse7pUaa	Cotton Cordell by Big O, white in color. It's nice also because it's got a rattle in it which seems to attract the fish and increase your sucsess rate. When I use a crankbait I just bring it in with a really slow steady retrieval, usually gets the fish going.|`|HYPAVgN9aa	My favorite lures for bass would be a jig with plastic trailer for big fish, Bandit or Strike King crankbaits, Spinnerbaits and Manns 1- for shallow fish, and Senkos for plastic worms.|`|2kbqK6q3aa	My favorite lure for bass is a Mepps inline spinner. I always have good results with that. As far as crankbait....well, I never had any luck with them either. I am not much of a crankbait person, but I am not going to give up on it just yet.|`|wEDOQBE2aa	Personally, I like either the Rapala X-Rap. The way it wobbles through the water is incredibly attracting to fish. I also like any of the DT series (also Rapala), especially the DT Flat with Sure-set hooks, because they get into tight spots without easily getting snagged. If I were to use soft baits, i would use any type of creature or mainly tubes that you can pull over sunken stumps, trees, and rocks or soft frogs that glide on top of the water with their legs dangling in the back.|`|icgvxHb6aa	My tips for the crankbaits would be to make sure that you are tying the knot directly to the lure and do not use a swivel and attatch it that way because it will not swim correctly.    My favorite lures would be   1.  Chatterbait- all of the chatterbait work great, they just make so many vibrations in the water it drives the fish crazy.    2.  Spinnerbait-  my favorite color spinnerbait is red and i like to use the colorado blades they seem to work great, the brand really doesnt matter to me.    3.  Minnowbait-  My favorite is the origanal rapala minnow bait in the original colors that works great.    Just make sure you tie you knot onot the crankbait if you do they are great if you dont they suck good luck  Happy Fishing!!!|`|n5yzXmR5aa	Favorite would probably be a 6" Yamamoto Senko worm, Red/Black color.  Had good luck with those.    Ive had good success in the spring with Crankbaits as well.. ive found if you crank,  pause, crank, pause, etc.. Ive gotten better results..|`|AQhJJT91aa	There are so many factors to consider when choosing which lure or bait to use. How deep are you fishing, the temp, what color is the water in the lake, the time of year, what are you fishing around.    The best I have done tournament fishing has been with some kind of worm.  We can start multiple discussions about the brand of worm, the color, what kind if rig, but I have had the best luck  on a long Carolina rig, medium length pumpkin seed with a chartreuse tail. Good luck

DfPyyDssaa	George Hackenschmidt.  He won the European version of the World Heavyweight championship in November of 1901 in Vienna, Austria by defeating Ahmed Madrali.  A few months later, "The Russian Lion" added the European Greco Roman Heavyweight title, another early version of the World Title. He held both European title for 3 years before he defeated American Heavyweight champion Tom Jenkins on May 4, 1905 in New York City.  That victory, in addition to his European championships and World Title tournament victories, solidified Hackenschmidt as the true owner of the unified, undisputed World Championship belt.  His other titles were declared vacant, and George Hackenschmidt was recognized as the original World Heavyweight Wrestling champion.|`|7AgWtSbHaa	im not sure|`|hkza2dKjaa	Georg Hackenschmidt|`|b5c261dfe3ee5e5442b8195afe51a0b9aa	i did research and it's George Hackensmith|`|HeyuTYmyaa	nono|`|uEj6jS24aa	y don't u ask my fore fathers this,bro!|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Georg Hackenschmidt would be my first guess since he was the first 1 I knew of but he was in 1905...

This is a reason i dont watch raw or smackdown anymore. After I found out how HHH , HBK, of Flair were putting down stars so they wouldnt lose their spot. Never wanting to make new stars. How many stars has either one of them made?     since the very beginning of 2000 until june 2003, HHH Raw record is 44-29-9. of those 29loses, only 8 of them were singles matches. Out of those 8loses, 4were by disqualification. down to 4 single matches he lost cleanly. the 4 are..:    10-02-00 - Kurt angle def. HHH by pinfall.  1-28-02 - Booker T def. HHH by pinfall  3-4-02 - Kurt def. HHH by escaping the cage.  10-28-02 - Kane def. HHH in a casket match.     so now we're down to HHH being pinned in singles matches only twice in 2yrs. so how exactly did he lose there 4 matches..    10-02-00 - Benoit goes after Steph and HHH attacks, Angle grabs a chair, but steph stops him, Benoit hits HHH, Angle slam, Angle is the  1 contender.     1-28-02 - Steph runs out to deal with Christian. HHH goes over to talk to her down off the apron, and next thing you know, Booker gets the Rollup for the pin.     3-4-02 - Cage match - HHH climbs, but steph charges in, chairshots him, crotches him, and thus ties him up in the ropes before singles handedly dragging Angle out for the win.     10-28-02 - Casket Match - HBK appears out of the casket and attacks HHH. Sweet chin music wakes up the crowd as Kane revives, chokeslams HHH and closes the lid.    So out of those 4 "clean" losses on RAW, 2 were by HHH getting distracted and 2 were by outside interference. 3 involved Steph. and one involved HHH best friend HBK.     That should show you what kind of a fair, apolitical, and vulnerable heel champion HHH really is...|`|Gr7My8FTaa	FALSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|uEj6jS24aa	WHOS THAT?|`|GnhoAXLsaa	FALSE!!!|`|0P40aUA0aa	who is Mr.Monday Night???|`|h5lOMoqBaa	Wrong, he made a one night appearance at the RR, that's it.

If approved, you purchase a $200.00 tax stamp, and take that and your paperwork back to the dealer to pick up your firearm.  shoot safe|`|0cLj35Fgaa	You can get it at a gun shop.

If you have a gun store near you that you trust and are on good terms with you can ask them to call you if they get any in (this is how I purchased mine).

n2O0NwR6aa	The coaches aren't really looking for who's "in shape" - they're looking for people who can do the skills required in cheerleading; jumps, tumbling, and the abilitiy to perform cheers and dances.  Those skills require some athletic ability... so yes, the people who do them well are usually in fairly good shape - for cheerleading.      But you can't tell if someone's in good shape for cheerleading just by looking at them.  A girl could be very slim and fit looking, but have little strength or endurance.  Another girl might be a bit overweight, but very strong and flexible.  And another girl might be extremely athletic, but not have a clue how to do a toe touch or a handspring.  What it all boils down to is - who can do the skills!|`|0a747ad2e34888b7d06436104b173b4daa	I think the coaches will know if you're in shape or not when it comes to tryouts. It's a very good idea to start stretching and strengthening before tryouts. Trust me, you will be glad you did! :) You'll be less likely to pull a muscle (painful) and your moves will be more sharp and accurate. Plus, you won't be so sore since your muscles have been prepared for it.    And good luck on tryouts! You should be fine if you work on the basics at least.|`|AA10978650	it would be easier i suppose but u can't do the moves that well if  u're not in shape

TEAKcA5Laa	in general? bolt action .308. hands down|`|C3Jl1ytPaa	In my opinion the 270 Win is the best all around deer rifle I have taken may deer and a large bull elk with mine the 270 is basically the same as the 30'06 but shoots flatter and more accurate and has enough power that when it hits the deer it usually knocks it down and it is less likely to run away and disappear and if it does run there is usually a good blood trail to follow|`|xOReEw6Waa	I've owned a bolt action 30-06 since I was 14. This is just like Goldilocks--It's just right!  I have a 30-06 because I hunt in North Idaho and have been in southern Idaho too, so I need a rifle I can trust out to 300+ yards. I sight in at 200 yards, so that puts me 1.75 inch high at 100 yards and still be only 4 to 7 inches low at 300 yards. Since I have shot deer as close as 25 feet with the 30-06, I think it works just fine. North Idaho is about the brushiest place I've had to hunt in, so I still appreciate the fact I CAN get out to 300+ yards. I also hunt elk and so the 30-06 can pull double duty not on just deer but moose,elk,bear,caribou.|`|TvARYVRJaa	bolt action 30-06|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The vast majority of Deer are harvested with the 30-30, 308, 30-06, 270, or 243 caliber than any other caliber within 100 yards or less.* Pick one of these.* Magnum calibers are not needed or necessary to Harvest Deer.*|`|2TB8p5fvaa	.270 Win all the way.|`|kMZMFaeHaa	All depends on your hunting situation. I agree with the bolt '06. or a 30-30 for thick woods|`|rWYp4ekeaa	I use a 270. win for feild   and 30-30 for thick woods|`|AQhJJT91aa	A remington 700 in the .223 is an awesome gun. It is not very expensive at all yet very reliable and accesories are very common.   The .223 is plenty of power to kill a deer especially with good shot placement.  It doesn't kick very bad making you anticiapate the shot and pull it.  Ammo is inexpensive and one of the most common rounds in the world.  My wife and kids first deer were taken with this gun and I carry it everywhere now. I have many guns to choose in the safe but this is the one that goes with me.|`|t4UrqK4Raa	It depends on your preference. I like the .308 but the 30-06 and 30-30 are really good too.|`|VP48PjM9aa	The Remington Model 700 VLS in .243 Win.  Top it with a Nikon Buckmaster 4.5-14 x 40 SF.  Mine likes Hornady Light Magnum 100 gr BTSP, the largest group this rifle has shot is .416 moa at 100 yds., not bad for a factory rifle.  This load is good for 400 yds., I won't shoot one past 300.  I have been hunting with this caliber since I was 12, have killed a pile of deer with it.  I really cannot see the need for anything more than the .243 Win.  Especially when you see how they react when hit, its like they have been hit by lightning, they drop where they stand.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	i dont know but the fellow about 5 questains ago said you can expect 30 + answers to this questain  13 for 1  an13 against  5 for some thing different  one 50 cal.  an one for aig gun,, probaly better to get bow, other wise youll still be reading on opening day,an countin thumbs,,little 30-30  lever about only thing not mentioned,|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	There are many out there and you will get many answers.To me a good deer rifle is one you can shoot well. I have many rifles from a 300 wsm to a .243 wssm. I flinch with the bigger gun, so I use the .243. It don't kick much more than a 22 mag. So I can shoot it dead nut. It brings them down as well as my .300 wsm|`|2sMgcDL3aa	A gun you can hit your target with. There are just to many choices and preferences.  I could name 100s good deer cartridges, but the best one is the one YOU shoot the best.  More than likely it will be with the gun you shoot the most so practice regularly.

zhMsAqCCaa	well my dearest buddy, while skiing its usually cold so wear some snow pants, a jacket, hat, gloves, warm clothes under your outerwear, goggles, and of course the skiis and your skiboots! have fun skiing and if its a warmer day you won't need as many layers of clothing :)|`|5FwFFlbgaa	cold weathe clothes. a big jacket and maybe more than one layer of clothing. maybe some gloves too.|`|QD7rWYeUaa	You may be to stupid to attach skis to your feet..|`|8a3965b472eea5c8d94232b7998f3ffbaa	Layer up.  Long johns, shirt, sweater, gator, one pair of ski socks, gloves, helmet, goggles, ski pants/bibs, skis, poles, boots.|`|Unaaay0Caa	first off make sure you have a ski coat & pants(waterproof/warm) under my coat as my second layer i usually wear a sweatshirt. under my sweatshirt i wear a type of under armor. on the bottom under my snow pants i wear under armor pants. if its really cold you could put sweat pants over them. also make sure you have waterproof gloves, snow googles, either a hat or helmet & if you want a neck warmer or face mask. also i like to swear ski socks, they keep you nice and warm....& another thing you might want to throw a few drinks and snacks if your bag, the food is usually over priced, hope this helps =)|`|OrG2fBbKaa	It depends on the temperature you expect to have at the area.  Several thin layers are much better than one heavy layer.  Do a Yahoo search for ski clothes and what do I wear skiing. You should get several hundred answers there.  The most common error most beginners make is to dress too warm and then they freeze from sweating from the exertion of skiing.
iT5vnplHaa	oakley crowbars are the best goggles hands down. get the crow bars or a frames. im getting the crowbars next year with the g30 lense or blue iridium. best goggles ull ever wear|`|mAtUgT8naa	if you wear a helmet, make sure the goggles fit snugly and comfortably on the helmet before you buy them.... not all goggles fit on all helmets|`|8a3965b472eea5c8d94232b7998f3ffbaa	Different lenses are for different light.  Anticipate the conditions where you'll be skiing and research it.  Many Oakley gog's have replaceable lenses.  You should probably try them on to check the fit, and try them on with your helmet to make sure they fit correctly with your helmet.|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Goggles are very much a preferance. Different color lenses as well as polarization should be considered. If you ski in bright sunlight most of the time consider a darker lense. If you want an all day all night goggle i would say go with a yellow or lighter orange, or dare i say clear. If you don't mind changing goggles when the sun goes down check out a bronze as it is great in bright light maybe with a mirror finish. Comfort is super important, but is very personal. Everyone loves oakley, sadly they make a goggle that i find uncomfortable around the eyes and also one that doesn't quite fit my helmet (not wide enough). I have a great pair of oakley goggles worth around 100 bucks but they are not my favorites (i inherited them lol). Most colored goggles have some U.V. protection and i know oakley and spy list all that kind of stuff at their website.     Any goggle in that price range will have anti fog to one degree or another.    As for style, that is prefrence as well. I prefer a bubble lense over the more normal flat lense as it gives me better perrifrials. Most more expensive goggles are of this type. One last thing as for colors i would stay away from in a lense. What out for blue, it causes eyestrain in most light conditions, yellow is great for night but can be over whelming in bright light and a goggle that is simply to dark...if you can weld in the things then its probably pretty damn hard to ski in them.

7otyLHwCaa	Yes, Morrow is a low-quality and cheap snowboard company, but you wouldn't notice a difference between a really good board and a low quality one anyways, seeing as you're a beginner, so you'll be fine for now. The problem with this is that once you get good, a bad board will hold you back, so keep that in mind. As for board width, I would go with a mid-wide or a wide atleast (you should really go to a snowboard shop and size yourself up on a board you see and make sure your toes dont hang over the edge of the board in an average stance). This will reduce toe drag, meaning it will prevent your toes from hanging over the edge of the board, and when carving really deep, you risk digging your toes into the ground and you will probably slip out on your ***... Finally, at your size, I would go with a 154-156. The smaller the board, the better you can maneuver yourself around on it, but you don't want too small, so dont go lower that 152 I'd say...  Anymore questions? just e-mail me. Hope I helped. Have fun dude! and good luck|`|hwr0xTUjaa	I'm 5'7" 165lbs and i use a 151 nitro but i'm into more freestyle and park so i use a smaller board. As far as width goes you should be ok with a regular width i wear size 11 and i use a regular width.

pSiwm8rmaa	Fedor win easy. Lesnar no joking, but not skills for now this.|`|ffh5mTViaa	Dana wants it.Brocks wants it. The fans want it. So here come the ifs.  If they hash out an acceptable deal with the UFC and Fedor.  If Brock can live up to his potential and unify the belt and defend it.  If Fedor doesn't take Anderson Silvas route and retire before the other two ifs play out.    Fedor is about the same age as Brock so he's still in his prime. Brock is just a baby as far as MMA experience go, but his physical skills are far beyond Fedor's or anyone he has ever faced. So let's say we see a seasoned Champion Brock vs Fedor. Fedor was getting beat to punch a majority of the time vs Arlovski. He will not match Brock's speed, power and strenth.  If Brock is mentally on,tko second round. GnP by the Vanilla Gorilla.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	I think Fedor would win in any way, submit, blows, maybe in a few years Brock will be of that level but isn't now, First he needs to beat Mir, then Gonzaga, and Barnett, then Velazquez, if he can beat those guys he will only have Fedor left. Maybe by then Dana White will have gotten his head out of his a$$.

By "do" what exactly do you mean? Do what?|`|AA11760438	Not suprised with HHH winning a shot at the Chamber match. He keeps playing his politics behind close doors. This is a reason i dont watch raw or smackdown anymore. After I found out how HHH , HBK, of Flair were putting down stars so they wouldnt lose their spot. Never wanting to make new stars. How many stars has either one of them made?     since the very beginning of 2000 until june 2003, HHH Raw record is 44-29-9. of those 29loses, only 8 of them were singles matches. Out of those 8loses, 4were by disqualification. down to 4 single matches he lost cleanly. the 4 are..:    10-02-00 - Kurt angle def. HHH by pinfall.  1-28-02 - Booker T def. HHH by pinfall  3-4-02 - Kurt def. HHH by escaping the cage.  10-28-02 - Kane def. HHH in a casket match.     so now we're down to HHH being pinned in singles matches only twice in 2yrs. so how exactly did he lose there 4 matches..    10-02-00 - Benoit goes after Steph and HHH attacks, Angle grabs a chair, but steph stops him, Benoit hits HHH, Angle slam, Angle is the  1 contender.     1-28-02 - Steph runs out to deal with Christian. HHH goes over to talk to her down off the apron, and next thing you know, Booker gets the Rollup for the pin.     3-4-02 - Cage match - HHH climbs, but steph charges in, chairshots him, crotches him, and thus ties him up in the ropes before singles handedly dragging Angle out for the win.     10-28-02 - Casket Match - HBK appears out of the casket and attacks HHH. Sweet chin music wakes up the crowd as Kane revives, chokeslams HHH and closes the lid.    So out of those 4 "clean" losses on RAW, 2 were by HHH getting distracted and 2 were by outside interference. 3 involved Steph. and one involved HHH best friend HBK.     That should show you what kind of a fair, apolitical, and vulnerable heel champion HHH really is...|`|dU4fwRoqaa	and this is the exact reason why the wrestling section sucks sooo bad now a days, seriously take this crap to the  fashion section or something|`|b0piAjacaa	what's the wrestling question little girl?

MJ had more 50+ games before Phil Jackson took over than any time after.  The triangle and the effectiveness of Pipen and others allowed MJ to take over in crucial situations instead of having to score on every offensive possession.  As you can see, in five years before Phil, no championships, in the years since Phil 6.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	Jordan barely scored 69 plus overtime.|`|1TgIuZMqaa	what kinda a dumb question is this?      I don't think Kobe or jordan are/were  at least a foot taller than every1 else on the floor....right?    Wilt was ahead of his time, athletically superior 2 every1 that stepped foot on the floor...thats how he scored a hundred...thats y i consider Kobe's 81 better than Wilts 100, it came in a much tougher time than the 60's...and Jordan played in an even tougher time, with  hand checks being aloud and the Jordan rules.      oh i get it know, ur trying 2 compare Jordan and Kobe?  well i've answered this question much too many time, so long story short    Jordan>>>>>>>>>>>Kobe|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	Actually, Wilt Chamberlain is the one who scored 100 in a game, not Bryant.  But Wilt played in an era when teams took faster shots and had more possessions in 48 minutes.  Plus teammates were just feeding him the ball to get to 100 because that game was a blowout.  Jordan has a higher career scoring average then anyone else but that was mainly earlier in his career.  Later on Phil Jackson played a slower game (the triangle offense) which limited possessions even more, and with Scottie Pippen soaking up shots that meant even less for MJ.

How did they let you post this crap?|`|2dgVkcVAaa	Thanks?|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Goat = The domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the Bovidae family and is closely related to the sheep: both are in the goat-antelope subfamily Caprinae. There are over three hundred distinct breeds of goats.[1]    Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species. For thousands of years, goats have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world.[2] In the last century they have also gained some popularity as pets.[3]    Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males as bucks or billies; their offspring are kids. Castrated males are wethers. Goat meat from younger animals is called kid, and from older animals is sometimes called chevon, or in some areas mutton.|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	thats great whats your point|`|sHBfVk19aa	awwww man wats up wit u|`|3teWTOPqaa	I have no idea what pound to pound means, Mark Jackson made that **** up, either you are a good scorer or your are not, your weight got nothing to do with it.

Cb5N6UaQaa	Maxiell is a star since 2 years ago. People just take him for granted and gi8ve the credit of all the inside defense of the Pistons to Rasheed. Maxiell has proved himself a better defensive player than Rasheed. In a couple of years when the Pistons rise again Maxiell will be their  1 big guy on the team and will get all the attention he deserves.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	sure      you know your stuff about basketball so ill believe what you say      perk showed him whose boss though|`|5f4qvGLKaa	I wish cause I love my pistons, but I see him at best being a starter who just averages that double double, like a Paul Millsap.  I love Maxiell's energy though, but his height prevents him from being a low post player and he's not fast enough to frequently play on the wing.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	I'm a Bearcat fan and all, but, I think that ship has sailed.  He will give good effort but doesn't have enough all around game or size.
S0u3HKzhaa	Cool,it was the WWF (World Wrestling Federation),but it was changed after a law suit in 2002 to the WWE because the WWF (World Wildlife Funds) sued them for the name because they had the name first.If i remember correctly the charges were dropped once they changed it to the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment).And know I have not met him but what I have heard id he is a real nice guy in real life.|`|cGKnTd6Yaa	you can't even spell his name and he has kids|`|CPmj1rnlaa	yeah i go to church thier to...sometimes its wwe now and no affence but sean is irish its realy shawn|`|AA12022123	your soo lucky but ya its actually shawn|`|XRw2ux9waa	I've met Shawn and he's a very kind man. But I didn't meet him at church, you're really lucky to be going there with him. Especially since that church day might be his only day off usually, since he still works for WWE today (yes it's been called WWE for a few years now).     Anyway, Shawn is arguably the greatest wrestler of all time, and if not, one of them. His wife was also in wrestling before, a Nitro girl from WCW. That's basically how the two met, Shawn was injured for a few years and he was at home watching WCW one night and saw her, he called one of his friends up, that friend introduced the two and Bam. They clicked.    What's it like going to church with him? Is it just like a normal church? Or do they treat him like some sort of A List Celebrity?

F1xpcJ2Laa	It was to clear up cap space so we can get good players in the coming seasons because he has a 20+mill contract that expires after this season..the 1st guy is wrong..because it was in no way too good to us (expect the cap space)|`|jnmuzyA7aa	because the billups was getting to old for them. they needed a knock down shooter and the nuggets needed a leader and a good point guard. so in the end it was a good deal for both teams.|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Cause they crazy like Marc Cuban!!!
jHJ0W9QNaa	they wanted to free up the salary cap in order to pursue a free agent in 2010. Iverson's contract is up after this year and the Pistons are preparing to rebuild their team.    EDIT: i've noticed you and "Joba Jr." are getting each other back and forth in the baseball section... if you need help, just let me know. i'll show those Yankees fans what us Boston fans are all about. i am the  1 hater. no mercy!!|`|7gL9laqLaa	because nobody like the pistons that is just the way it is|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Because the pistons needed to open up some salary room. Plus they needed a chnage for that team. In the past 2 years they have been beaten in the eastern conference final. Sure they made it there but both the cavs and the celts opened up some big problems on that team. They werent good enough to beat them. The deal didnt work for them but I don't blame them for trying it|`|OxS3UVE6aa	they wanted to free up the salary cap in order to pursue a free agent in 2010.

4owr19vCaa	these are common:    ----------    - Capture the flag:  2+ teams establish a base with some object to denote the "flag" (soccer ball, basketball, etc whatever is on hand).  Last team to have flag intact wins.  Respawn / medic recommended (else ends up being simple team elimination)    - Defend the fortress:  2+ teams, one establishes a base and defends it.  First team to capture base wins, else defending team wins by eliminating all other teams.  Respawn / medic not recommended.    - Search and Rescue / Hostage:  2+ teams, one (or all) team(s) have a hostage.  Opposing teams have a "rescue force" to reach the hostage.  Respawn / medic recommended.    - Body Guard / Secret Service:  2+ teams, one team has to escort a VIP to a destination.  All other teams  attempt to gain VIP as hostage.  Respawn / medic recommended (good precursor to Search / Rescue scenario)    - Bunker hill:  Similiar to "defend the fortress" on high ground and well placed bunkers for defense.    - Deathmatch:  2+ players, no teams, every man for himself.  Respawn / medic not recommended.    - Fox & hound / predator:  3+ players (or teams), one player (or team) is designated the hound / prey.  Others hunt him / them down.  Respawn / medic optional.  Best if hound / prey are most experienced players (or have the best / more powerful weapons).    - Double Agent:  2+ teams, one is a double agent for opposing team.  Respawn / medic optional.    - Assimilation:  2+ teams, hits on opposing teams make them members of your team.  Respawn / medic required.  Good precusor to fox & hound / predator scenario.    ----------    Any scenario available from most first person shooter type games usually work well (Call of Duty multiplayer, etc)      cheers

EGe0k8P6aa	Again... Such hate for airgun hunting... Very disappointing...    There are a number of air-guns in your price-range that will work for hunting rabbits, though the more powerful PCP hunting air-rifles are outside your price range. (It might be worth bumping your price-range up a bit to get a Benjamin Discovery or a Sumatra 2500 since they'll probably give you more power, quicker follow-up shots, and more accuracy, but that's entirely up to you.)    In .177 caliber, pretty much any of the guns that deliver a muzzle velocity of around 700+ fps will work. This includes the:   - Crosman 2100  - Benjamin 397  - Beeman RS1  - Beeman RS2  - Crosman G1 Xtreme  - Crosman Phantom 1000  - Crosman Quest 1000  - Diana RWS 34 Panther  - Gamo Big Cat 1200    In .22 caliber, any of the 600+ fps rifles should have enough power to kill rabbits. This includes the:  - Daisy 22SG  - Beeman RS2 Air  - Benjamin 392  - Crosman Quest 800X  - Diana RWS 34 Panther  - Mendoza RM-2000    Personally if you're going to be shooting rabbits, I'd encourage you to look at the more powerful guns like the RWS 34 Panther and Benjamin 392 in .22 caliber since they should deliver more power at longer ranges than the .177 caliber guns. Still inside 20-30 yards it shouldn't matter which caliber you go with. You can review the different guns I mentioned at Pyramid Air to get a feel for which one you want.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	rws 34 from adventuresinairguns.com $190 or benjamin 397/392 from mac1airgun.com $140  just let them know i sent you!|`|TEAKcA5Laa	for the love of god, you can almost buy a freakin' used 10/22 for that!. keep savein' your money, kid.|`|kMZMFaeHaa	i agree. buy a .22 or other rimfire. don't bother with air rifles|`|bYVCuyGFaa	You can't get a good air rifle for that cheap I'd say go with a gamo whisper it's only slightly more expensive ( 50$ or so) and it takes them out easy. But it's much easier to use a rimfire rifle and it cost the same or cheaper. I love my .22 rifle with a 4x32 scope|`|NN4lnWYEaa	Benjamin air soft.|`|GfHnW6staa	buy a 22 cal.  its really small, absolutely no recoil, and very cheep  perfect for shooting a rabbit right in the eye|`|QvOjuBOraa	Air rifles are useless against anything but cans. Go the .22 + scope if you want to get them from distance or try getting yourself a shotgun. If you want to sneak up on them get yourself a shotgun or get both and if you miss with the shotgun get them with the rifle =]
Jd04Z1ISaa	Alot of people feel that the SuperBowl is bigger than WrestleMania, but I have to spread a little facts after years of research.    WrestleMania has outsold the SuperBowl in Attendance a total number of 7 times, basically each time WrestleMania was held in a SuperBowl stadium.    WrestleManias in SuperBowl stadiums (football staduim) pump more money into the local economy every time!, for example WrestleMania 18 pumped 38$ million into the Houston economy, and The superbowl only pumped 22$ million.    During WrestleMania 3 when WrestleMania was held on live TV, due to there being no PPV, WrestleMania 3 had 42 million viewers worldwide, SuperBowl has 50 million a year.    Another fact is, WrestleMania has more than the 1 million viewers that order PPV, studies show alot of people watch online for free, over friends house, in blast areas that show WWE events, basically 28 million people watch WrestleMania for free every year instead of buying PPV. Also WrestleMania is watched world wide, other countries can care less about the SuperBowl and few don't know that the SuperBowl exist.    The ending fact is WrestleMania makes 62 times more profit that the SuperBowl, what gives the superbowl the edge is that its free.|`|QIWvbNFWaa	Superbowl without a doubt ABOUT 95% OF US WATCH SUPERBOWL MORE THAN WRESTLEMAINIA    PLUS WRESTLING IS FAKE|`|eIOlBzm8aa	lets see a fake event or football. I'm going to have to say the SB BY FARRRRRRRRRRRRRR|`|U2DJBcNUaa	Superbowl Sunday is more of an unofficial holiday.  Everybody knows about it.  Wrestlemania is not exactly that popular, but it is close.  Stats prove that more people watch Superbowl mainly because it's free, and WM costs like 50 dollars.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Superbowl hands down. WWE is like Jerry Springer it's just one big joke. But entertainment is valuable and desired so you can't say it is a waste of time!|`|aXdGCbEDaa	1. Better Trophies  The Vince Lombardi Trophy, which is basically a football on a stick, will sit on some shelf and collect dust for most of the year. You cant even drink out of it like the Stanley Cup. A WWE Championship, on the other hand, is paraded around by the champ 24/7. Plus, the title itself is great for keeping pants up.    2. Zero Commercials  The cost for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl XLIII? Three million dollars. For that reason alone, commercials have taken on nearly as much significance as the game, if not more. Throw in the over-hyped halftime show, and the 60 minutes of actual football action becomes an afterthought. At WrestleMania, matches are never overshadowed by anything, especially not by a bunch of Budweiser horses.    3. Our Post-Game is Raw  Super Bowl winners talk about making that pilgrimage to Disneyland after their victory. Win or lose, WWE Superstars compete on Raw the very next night.    4. Hallelujah! No Bob Costas  With Super Bowl XLIII airing on NBC this year, youll be subjugated to at least four hours of inane pregame chatter spewing from the mouth of diminutive, non-athlete Bob Costas. Hes not nearly as entertaining as the similarly-sized Hornswoggle, but he is much cleaner.    5. Our former GM Actually Played in the NFL  Back in the day, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was a sports star  at his high school in the ultra-rich suburb of Bronxville, NY. The man never played a single down in the pros. Say what you will about Mike Adamles time as Raws GM, but the man scrambled at running back for seven seasons with the Jets, Bears and Chiefs during the smashmouth 1970s. For that, he has our respect.    6. Hardys Trump Mannings  A big game match-up between Peyton and Eli would be an instant on-field classic. But figure theyd also appear in at least half of the commercials that night, and itd add up to just too much Manning. Wouldnt you rather see Matt and Jeff Hardy team up or face off? Well of course you would.    7. Tickets for the Fans Not Corporate Stooges  This year, Roger Goodell and the NFL have set aside a thousand Super Bowl tickets for fans. Face value? Five-hundred dollars a pop. Considering that Raymond James Stadium can hold up to 75,000 strong, the NFL is doling out a scant 1.3 percent of the total tickets. Good luck scoring one. Reliant Center, the host site of the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania (and home to the Houston Texans), can seat 71,000 fans and offers admission for as little as $40 per ticket. Whats the better value? You do the math.    8. Bookmakers Need Not Apply  There is absolutely no chance Las Vegas has any undue say in the outcome of any of the matches at WrestleMania. Were just saying.    9. Higher Standards  Wide receivers will go horizontal to catch a pass, but will they leap from a 16-foot high ladder to notch a TD?    10. The Undertakers Streak  The Steel Curtain Pittsburgh teams took three Super Bowls in the 1970s, Dallas took three in the 1990s, and New England has dominated the new millennium with a trio of wins. If those franchises qualify as dynasties, then what do you call Undertakers streak of 16 wins and zero losses? Phenomenal.    11. Superior Fashion at WWE Hall of Fame Ceremony  Every summer in Canton, Ohio, the Pro Football Hall of Fame honors a select group of retired players  by making them wear ghastly cream-colored blazers. Honestly, they make that green jacket from the Masters Tournament look stylish. The WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, prior to Mania, has no such dress code  although black tie is preferred. All class.    12. You Actually Watch IT with Fans  Remember the last Super Bowl party you attended? No? Probably because the guests (specifically your girlfriend or wife and her annoying friends) were more concerned with idle chitchat than gridiron action. Fact is, when Mania begins, fans are glued to the action.    13. Helping H-Town  Ticket holders at the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania are headed to the largest city in the Lone Star State. We dont have to remind you about the hell that hurricanes wreaked on Houston in the summer of 2008. While in town, lend a helping hand to local charities, or at the very least crack open that wallet and help stimulate the local economy (well show you where and how next issue). Now thats patriotism!    14. Hotter Reporters  Sorry, Andrea Kramer. Although your sideline reporting skills are second only to Suzy Kolbers, youre no match for the stunning Eve Torres.        It just depends on what you like.I LOVE both.I watch them both every year with friends and family (even today).And it's great everytime.I love both,but I gotta go with WM on this one.|`|gSgYDAEAaa	Superbowl by far|`|DPlJiWyWaa	As a wrestling and football fan I have to go with the Super Bowl.

sPiwb8Hraa	It would have to be the Steelers fans because the Cardinals fans have everything to be happy about no matter what the outcome.|`|c17x6L4baa	I think the steelers fans will feel worse because of their history of being a top team.  The Cards fans will be let down.  But, considering 2-4 in the last six regular season games,  most are just amazed to be in the SB at all.  The Cards fans will also be happiest if they win because of the assumptions of victory the steelers fans have.    For the first answerer.  If they win, the Cards will plant a cactus in front of Hines Field that will die the first hard freeze if a poor sport doesn't kill it first.  If the steelers win, they will plant a Pennsylvania tree here that will die in July if it is not the victim of a poor sport.|`|VmGrypxVaa	Steelers, cause they made a bet with the Cardinals, to go green and plant and plant a native plant(3rd time i said plant).

If we had manny Id say Im 100% confident thell be no collapse.    I think our rotation is fair. Johan is a shoe in for at least 15 wins again i bet he can get 20 now that hes been in ny. Pelf is comming of age I really think hes gunna be great I can see him out  2 with at least 10-12 wins. Main is our 500% guy hell prob go 9-10 or 10-9 something like that. I really think we will have $ left over If wed ever get manny. Id get someone like pedro or wolf there cheap and desperate to sign by now. There old but they give u some innings and a couple wins.  5 neice lets give the rookie a try i really liked his stuff last year. Hes got great potential.     Even if we get no manny where is our top prospect F-Mart?

TBAfpnmgaa	I agree about the repetition of questions. I wish that Yahoo Answers had a way of screening questions to let you know that you're asking a question that had already been answered recently. Besides, questions like your example are more opinion questions. I was hoping that YA would be a good source of facts and experience, not just a forum. Because, you're right. There is no factual answer to a question like yours. I have seen people kill deer with anything from a .22 revolver to a 50 caliber black powder rifle, and everyone thinks their answer is best.   If I could recommend 3 changes to this website, especially the Hunting category, it would be:  1) Come up with another site for Airsoft, BB Guns, and movie fantasy gun category questions  2) Block the bleeding heart Vegans from thumbing down all the questions about eating what we kill  3) Weed out the kids who think that their first gun should be a Barret 50 caliber "sniper" rifle because they're "cool". By the way, can we also ban the words "sniper rifle", assault rifle", and "machine gun" from the hunting site?    By the way, I'm awfully fond of my .30-30!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	In reality the vast majority of Big and Small Game is Harvested within 100 yards or less, and very rarely beyond 300 yards.* The best choice's in actual use are the 30-30, 32 Winchester Special, 308, 270, 30-06, 243.* All of these calibers have Harvested more Game Animals than any other calibers.* Magnums are not needed or necessary to Harvest Deer.* I use the 30-06, 32 Winchester Special, and 30-30.*|`|vED9Pwiuaa	get a remington 700 bdl in .270 its the best rifle i ever shot or owned|`|YjBAWgt7aa	i would consider the 270. its a smooth shooting gun, it has hard knock down power but at the same time doesnt mess up the meat. its recoil isnt so bad either.  another gun i would look into would b the 30-06. its good for kinda long shots, maybe up to 400 yards.  but for long shots u might want to get a 300. magnum, this gun has a good bit of recoil but is perfect for the avid hunter who enjoys long shots.  if u want to know brands, try CVA Optima Elite of Thompson Center Arms|`|vQUb2aT1aa	First of all I want to say I agree with you brother, I am relatively new to yahoo answers and I have noticed this trend myself.  I wish someone would come along and put the final nail in this coffin.  But I am going to throw in my unbiased answer in hopes that it will help aleviate the situation.  This question is one of those with no real "correct" answer.  "The best deer rifle" can be a different weapon for different people.  There are many factors that affect this such as location.  Out west where looong (300 yards +) are common, someone would want a flat shooting, high velocity projectile that will really reach out and touch something, such as the 30-.06 or the 270.  Here in East where I'm from many times a long shot constitutes around 100 yards.  In a case such as this something like the tried and true 30-30 (or my personal fav. the .45-70)will get the job done with excellent results.  It also depends on the shooters preference to different rounds.  If somebody flinches at the recoil of a 7mm-08, then that definitely isn't the arm for them.  In short, there is NO, I repeat NO, "perfect" deer rifle.      And by saying that the .45-70 is my favorite, I am not saying that it is the perfect deer rifle, I just don't like to track my deer down when I can knock him on his derierre where he stands.|`|f5sSF9n1aa	i personaly use a savage model 110 its a .243 it works like a charm|`|wxL5MRz7aa	HA HA!    i get to be the first to suggest my Marlin express .308 :-D    the short lever action rifle is great in tight areas such as woods and the .308 express can easily reach out and touch ya at 300 yards.    very veristal.|`|2sMgcDL3aa	How about this...  One your are good enough with to hit your target and that delivers 1000 pounds of force at your maximum terminal range.    I've personally hunt Deer with everything between a 7mm TCU (100-150 max range) to a .458 Win Mag (down loaded to a about a 45/70 load).  I would also never shoot at a deer more than 400 yds away.

These questions get archived for long enough that you can probably get a dozen questions on just 30-30 / 30-06 difference. I don't mind putting up an answer, but the folks really need to be specific. I'm like you, I actually have multiple 30 caliber rifles that I can choose from, or the 243. I'm big on practice and shot placement, that and knowing were to hit by studying "The Perfect Shot" books. I hunt differently in Shoshone County than I would around Grangeville, and then southern Idaho is completely different from either. I get tired of hearing that a 30-06 isn't a brush gun, or that you need a magnum to drop a deer or elk. Every gun has a range of animals that it is useful on and an envelope that is within ethical limits. That's whats important is to match range and animal with the rifle. I know I get 300 yard shots on elk so I use a 30-06 or 300WSM, but they both double as deer,moose or bear rifles. I take the 300 WSM when I think the range on average is going to be 200+ yards and the 30-06 when it might be closer to 100.|`|ax87mteHaa	if you're hunting in Texas a .270 is large enough. in Colorado or any of the states w/ larger deer, i'd go with a 30.06.|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	Sorry but i have to put my two cents in to. The guns I like to kill with are 7mm rem mag and a 22-250 because they are some of the fasts and flats shooting bulits on the market. Everything else is to slow or the bullet drops to fast or it doesnt have enough take down power. And yes i have seen deer killed with a air soft rifle, but i gues it just depends on how good a shooter a person is.You all can do the math on the web pag below.

AA10259042	Both 8x40 and 10x40 are very popular with wildlife viewers.  The 8x40 generally have a wider field of view which is very beneficial for trying to find flying birds or birds in branches of trees.  8x40 have less jiggle of the image but not noticeably less magnification. I have both and I can barely tell the difference.  Select a pair of roof prism binos as they are water proof and fog proof.  You can spend a lot of money on a pair, up to $3000 but generally speaking you get only about 10% improvement in performance for each doubling in price.  So somewhere in the $200 to $700 price range is really good performance fore a reasonable price.  In the higher price range you generally get locking diopter adjustment, which is something I really like.  One of my pairs has it and one does not.  The more expensive pairs are marketed mainly to birders, who are always trying to impress other birders with their optics.     Nikon makes some outstanding binoculars, but they are very expensive. I once had a pair.      Among the less expensive but very good pairs are these:    Nikon trailblazer 8x40      http://www.eagleoptics.com/binoculars/ni...     Inexpensive, excellent eye relief if you should ever have to wear glasses,  decent field of view but not great,  very poor close focus but not too important if you are not interested in dragon flies or butterflies.     Vortex Diamondback is in the same price range but has some advantages.  Wider field of view and much closer focus.     http://www.eagleoptics.com/binoculars/vo...    I do not believe that either of these have locking diopter adjustment though.  Another nice feature that some binos have and some do no is twist up eye cups.  They are normally found in the more expensive binos.|`|ZKikquiOaa	The Nikon Monarch that Travis mentioned is definitely top notch, look through that and you won't go back.  With binos, you get what you pay for, the Monarch price level is the most saturated price level out there.  It's the $300-$400 price range, another one that I'd recommend near that price range is the Carson XM HD series.  They're comparable to the Monarch's performance at a slightly cheaper price.    The key to binoculars is to always buy porro design, until you get above the $150 price range.  Any roof bino under $150 will be lacking when compared to a similarly priced porro.  The monarch and most bino with a 40mm lens are roof binos, these binos have parallel tubes, porros have angled tubes.  You see roof binos need phase correction in order for the image to be sharp, phase correction cost money, so cheap roof binos forgo the correction.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Don't know but they are expensive if you want some really powerful ones.  I tried out some good ones that belong to my brother in law and they gave me a headache, so should suggest you don't get the ones that give a headache.  Hope it works out well.  I was into watching birds by the way and found some rare ones that weren't in any bird books.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I have spent a lot of time looking through binoculars the last few months trying to pick my next pair.  I've never owned really good binoculars, and after looking through quality glass, I just can't keep using my old junkers anymore.  The clearest and best rated binoculars (at least in my price range) have been the Nikon Monarch 10x42.  Leupolds are a very close second.

7ENpTDQJaa	best thing to do is to just keep practicing. try getting more pop on your tail and level out the front of the board by sliding your foot up and putting some pressure on it. once you feel really comfortable with your ollies then you will be able to start rolling and doing them. i would try a smooth surface like a garage to practice first.
GHPpsbHwaa	If you are really devoted to tennis and will play it a lot, then go for the more expensive ones $70 plus, but if you aren't, then just go to walmart and pick up a $20 one.  But to answer your question, a beginner should get a heavier racquet.  Light racquets are for pros who have long swings and can generate their own power.  Heavier racquets are for those with small swings or beginners.  They also have a bigger headsize, meaning you will have an easier time hitting the ball.  Don't go with lighter racquets, because it won't be very fun for you and trying to hit the ball will be nearly impossible.  Go for a heavier racquet with an oversized head.      ANSWER TO YOUR EDIT:  It's not the racquet at all, not matter how much you want to blame it, it's your groundstroke motion.  If you face the racquet head upwards it will make the ball fly higher, but if you keep it lower it makes the ball lower, but too low and it will land in the net, it takes lots and lots of practice to be able to consistently hit the ball in the right way.  Pros make it look easy because they practice with a coach for like 6 hours a day.|`|T40ZH7Tvaa	Just go to a sports shop . Aim for something at $30+ though
TEAKcA5Laa	yes, but they will not eject on their own power, either.|`|AEzJHIz7aa	It will work from the perspective of going "bang!"    However, it's really a pain in the tail.  The 10/22 isn't made to be loaded as a single-shot, and getting the cartridge into the chamber is awkward.  Then, of course, you have to manually eject it.    But, yes, it will shoot.  You won't harm your gun in the process.|`|2sMgcDL3aa	NO NO NO!  For safety's sake, use only .22LR ammo as Ruger recommends.    I have heard of an after market modification kit that allows full cycling of a 10/22 using .22CB caps.    Remember you can damage your chamber using the shorter CB's, unless you keep the chamber clean and clean it after each use.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	It will be a pain in the butt loading those cartridges singly, but if you are up for it, it won't hurt the rifle, and they will go "POP!".    Doc|`|h2KkiKK3aa	probably not, since they don't have the pressure needed to eject the case right, so the case will be stuck in the chamber instead of ejecting, too much work for the rewards in my perspective, just get a small, single shot .22, really cheap, $50-$100, and have fun with it.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	If you use the 10/22 as a bolt rifle it will work just fine.  Fill up a clip. Shoot, work the bolt manually, and shoot again.  It's not a big deal.  You might even be able to find a sub sonic load with a big enough bullet to build enough pressure to work the bolt automatically.  Just try a few and see what happens.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Will work but as said won't rechamber another round.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	From the answers, it sounds about like the time I used some CCI shotshells in my XD.     They fired just fine, but there wasn't enough recoil to cycle the action, so I had to manually work the slide after every shot.     No big deal, really.|`|AA11694178	Yes, you can shoot them one at a time but the rifle will not cycle properly to eject the spent shell.  If you have a single shot .22, it will be easier to load the CBs into the chamber.  The 10/22 can be a bit awkward to shoot single shot but it can be done quite safely if you wish.
AA11016927	Well, the economy is disappearing quicker than hot-wings at a Hooters!    So, along with the "new stocking" premise, Walmart's probably trying to make some extra dough before the "American economy" becomes the "Chinese/American" economy.     It's unfortunate Charles that you, (and me & everyone else) are living in this era. Things are gonna get worse before they get better......and I hope we all won't have to sell our fishing gear to buy bread and toilet paper OR worse!    Although I don't think much of their worms, Renegade does make a decent Yozuri Crystal Minnow copy.     Charles- FYI: On EBay, you can purchase exact copy's of Renegade worms in MANY different colors, by the POUND, for an average price of like 5-20 cents per worm and most can be special-ordered hand-poured with designer colors!! I buy stuff off EBay all the time; it has saved me tons of money over the years. You should go check it out....|`|TBAfpnmgaa	Dear Charles, thanks for spreading the woord about our big sale.   Wal-Mart Advertising Dept.    Seriously, the other posters are right. They're just getting rid of some old stock, getting ready to bring in this year's inventory. It kind of reminds me of one of my first jobs. I was working at a Western Auto and we sold tons of fishing equipment. We had lures in every color and shape, wildly bent hooks, and lots of equipment that came in flashy packaging and had pictures of famous TV fishermen on them.   I've always been one to fish with a plain rod and reel and natural bait, and I asked the store owner if all those lures worked. He said, "They work for me. I catch about a dozen fishermen a day with them."|`|47R03TbFaa	WAL-MART IS TRYING TO GET RID OF THE OLD STUFF SO THEY CAN GET READY FOR THE NEW STUFF COMING IN|`|6wNbnZNKaa	nice. i thought it would go up since its winter where i live. but i guess they just need to sell sell sell lol|`|5IB8Fwdeaa	all on sale cause the new stuff for spring is ready to hit the shelves|`|lECmz3SEaa	I believe they are remodeling I noticed the sales, but I already have most of those items.

XfX57xPgaa	yea i dont think either of these teams deserves to be in the superbowl.|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	Yes|`|U7oDXHglaa	i don't think so|`|b737c34b13c7c1e591c03a8665d3e3fdaa	Neither one of these teams will rank among the greatest Super Bowl winners of all time, and yes there have been many great teams that didn't win (and in many cases, didn't even get to) the Super Bowl. To be honest, I don't think there were any truly great teams this season, at least not in a historical context. I don't find that disappointing, though. Only one team gets to win the Super Bowl each season, and I can't hold it against any team that takes advantage when the opportunity presents itself|`|dguR4W4Iaa	I disagree, but that's just me. I can't say much about the Cardinals (since I have not watched many of their games this season), but I can speak for the Steelers when I say that it's been a tough season. Our team has had, in my opinion, one of the toughest schedules this season, and I think we've done an amazing job so far. I think it's great that the Cardinals are finally going to try to win a Superbowl for the first time. I also think it's great that the Steelers are going to try to go for the six pack. Either way, it should be a good game, and I have respect for both teams and the individual challenges they have had to overcome to get where they are now.|`|4POGapREaa	What rock have you been living under?  The STEELERS have won the Superbowl 5 TIMES, making them one of only THREE TEAMS to have ever accomplished that.  And they were the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowl titles in six seasons, a feat which is yet to be matched.  And they have been division champions 19 times.  So suck it.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Did they not win the games to get there? Exactly.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Yeah, I know...it must suck that the team with the  1 Defense in the NFL is playing for the Championship....HOW DARE THEY ???

May the best team win. If your disappointed then don't watch. Sucks to be you!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	No. Someone has to win.
sywoTNKgaa	Yes, Serena is the best comeback player of all time. She's also the best revenge player I've ever seen. She's good at getting revenge on players who's beaten her. She lost to Capriati 3 times in a row, she came back and dominated Capriati the following year. Same with Henin, Hingis, Sharapova, and now Dementieva.    What makes her impressive is not just the fact that she does this, but the caliber of players she does this against.    She's given several former  1s Henin (Miami 2008), Sharapova (AO 2007) , Capriati (Wimbledon 2001), Davenport (Indian Wells 2001), Hingis (Miami 2002), and Venus (Miami 2002) the worst losses of teir careers after they got to  1.|`|deuYlqvwaa	I would say Jennifer Capriatti is  She came back to win the Australian Open  And defeated her opponent in two straight sets  I forgot the year that occured though.|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Amongst the ladies, she is possibly the best comeback tennis player. But overall, I would say Lleyton Hewitt is arguably one of the best comeback players ever.

EGe0k8P6aa	It depends a lot on the gun and how fast its capable of firing a pellet of a given weight. (For sake of accuracy, I'm going to suggest knocking at least 100 fps off any guns claims since it seems most (but not all) of the manufacturers are using extremely light-weight pellets to get their claimed muzzle velocities). In general .22 caliber pellet guns are small game rifles capable of humanely taking most small game and pest species (mice, rats, birds, squirrels, rabbits, jackrabbits, raccoons...).     With most "high-powered" spring piston air rifles and the lower-power PCP guns (claimed muzzle velocities of 700-900 fps), you'd be limited to animals like birds, squirrels, rabbits, jackrabbits, raccoons, and possum. Fox would be a stretch since you're looking about 20 ft-lbs of energy, but with proper pellet placement it should be possible. Nutria sized animals should be possible. Not sure about ground hogs, due to their relatively stout bodies and thick skulls.    On the other hand, there are .22 PCP guns (with claimed muzzle velocities of up to 1200+ fps) that generate up to 40-60 ft-lbs of energy and which could handle fox and possibly coyote with head shots at close range, though this is strongly not recommended. (This is based on Chrono-numbers from Pyramid Airs review of the Airforce Condor which indicate it turns out about 55 ft-lbs of muzzle energy with 28 grain Eun Jin heavies. Similar guns like the Sumatra 2500 and Career 707 should yield similar results.)  For coyote you really need a big-bore airgun in something like .30 caliber, 9mm, or .45 caliber. Anyway... you'd be able to take larger small game animals like nutria, jackrabbits, and possibly ground hogs fairly easily with proper shot placement.|`|km9cQNAXaa	Projectiles from .22 air weapons lack energy for humane kills on game. I would only use them on rats inside the barn.    For small game get yourself a .22LR rim-fire, that way you get a clean kill at realistic range. Coyote is about as large as I would go with one of these.    Anything bigger then your into centre-fire territory.    Ian M|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	First off, I would like to commend "J Kirsch" for his excellent answer..    IMO, The more specific you get, the better answer you "should" receive..

EGe0k8P6aa	Ugh... So much hate and ignorance about this topic...    Lets see... why use an air-rifle to hunt in states that allow it. There are a couple reasons I can see...    For starters, they're quieter than a firearm. (Though that might be be debatable when you start getting up to the large-bore PCP guns if you compare it with a .22 LR). There are recorded instances of people getting multiple shots at game animals because the animals aren't alarmed by the pop of an airgun, unlike the crack of a rifle.    Second, they're not firearms (or at least most areas don't consider them to be firearms), so you can usually use them in areas where its illegal to use a firearm or areas where even though legal, using a rifle would/could cause problems (as Mike Scholby talks about in his article Coffee Shop Coyotes and Jim Chapman talks about in his article entitled The Urban Hunter). Basically the reason you can get away with this is that unlike high-power rifle bullets which will travel for up to 3-4 miles or even a .22 rifle bullet which can go for up to 1.5 miles, air-rifle ammunition usually looses all its energy after 300-400 yards. Those factors combine to mean you probably won't have to go nearly as far to find a spot to hunt.    Then there's the fact that some people want the challenge of getting close enough to game animals to kill them with an air-rifle, as opposed to people on this thread who evidently view any rifle without the power to drop an animal from the next county as under-powered.     Those are the reasons I can see off the top of my head. There are probably others...|`|C3Jl1ytPaa	I have never heard of hunting with an air rifle it sound pretty unethical I believe is using a real gun and not making the animal suffer and besides it's illegal at least here in Texas my advice would be give up the air rifle and get a real gun fitting for the game you are hunting air rifles are for kids and target shooting not for hunting|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	the only advantage is that a Felon thinks they can have it and hunt with it...if you are legally allowed to own a firearm then there is no benefit to use one over gun powder|`|TEAKcA5Laa	it beats the crap out of hunting with a low powered airgun any day.|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	The rifles are quiet, accurate and effective, pellets are lightweight and inexpensive...|`|RX5t6x6Haa	MARK M - ====> have never heard of hunting with an air rifle it sound pretty unethical I believe is using a real gun and not making the animal suffer and besides it's illegal at least here in Texas    1) YES they are LEGAL in TEXAS  2) unethical? unethical?

But make sure you use hunting pellets and not target ammo. They are used for small game such as squirrels and rabbits. They save slot of the meat too. They are great for young hunters or beginers. I use a gamo whisper with a 4x32 air rifle scope.|`|002f5fa65269c7247cb9454acb81fe1aaa	I personally don't hunt with one but one reason to hunt with an airgun is people find it more of a challenge.     Before you do start hunting with one make sure you know the laws of your state, i know that in Kentucky airguns that shoot metal pellets or BBs are considered Deadly weapons. If you're pulled over and you have you one on you, they can charge you with carrying concealed deadly weapon if you don't have your permit.

Courageous|`|DRXi06bEaa	this may seem stupid but i cant remember any really courageous moments from last season, although the barry hall pushing/punching incident was pretty courageous :)  the one that sticks out in my mind is in 2007 when dale thomas hip and shouldered a guy to mark the ball and got knocked out!!!  wow i was like OHMYGOD that is scary!!!|`|Nt2JOKRAaa	heaps of good answers. stole most of mine. Mitch Hahn when he tackled 3 guys in a row then handballed it for a goal, Milne with his swollen face, but by far hodgey's entire september was the most courageous in 08.   oh and brett delideo (he won the army awards) collided with a stkilda guy|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	Luke Hodge playing in grand final was most courageous sport moment for me in 2008 not just in AFL but all sport (Tiger Woods winning with broken leg and knee was 2nd)|`|cXxyRqXvaa	I have to say Luke Hodge in both finals, as I have had similar injuries, that was tough.|`|90907b7c487c66bf81c4bee8fda1d645aa	I think each and "every player" who pull on their boots and club colors, and run over the white line, are performing  a courageous act just doing that. With some of the serious injuries that have occurred over time, any player before a game aware of the the dangers, has great courage to accept that he,  could easily be the next serious injury in the game, to me that's courageous|`|HUbq9Hjlaa	Well, believe me or not, the most courageous act by a player last year was Cameron Bruce from the Melbourne Football Club.|`|mXFOru11aa	there was alot it's hard to pin point 1|`|2s244jGgaa	I have got to give credit to steven milne, when he played on in that game against Saint Kilda with a broken Jaw.

WrDGhduxaa	Without running, or using a gym there isn't much you can do that will help your 400 running.|`|ocHNtbQZaa	Try speed Russian lunges for aerobic work. Get in a low squat position and bounce up and down a few times then lunge forward with one leg and back with the other like a scissors kick. Continue to bounce/lunge without stopping for up to a few minutes and you will get in good shape. Also try altitude drops where you jump off a chair and land on balls of feet, knees slightly bent. Start out with a few reps until you get used to the force of landing.|`|KoJ0rddfaa	squats, lunges, pushups, ab work...a strong core really helps with running.|`|y2CzXNTLaa	There isn't that much you can do without being at the track or gym but you can do core body work like planks or just do some light stretching to help with your flexibility.|`|8rJK8Dlmaa	i don't think there's nothing you can do. if you don't run you'll lose condition and you need all the air you can get in this sprint as it is the hardest of the sprints. i don't like treadmills cause you can just stop when you get tired or bored and there hard (or at least mine is) i prefer running in a track (rubber or dirt, pavement hurts you) because you can also practice technique on a track so you know how to use your energy correctly and thus win  unless you want to be in the shot put or javelin throw you can't stop running

6Mpi3Bgjaa	You are right...this is becoming a lost art..  but these are the players who have it    Duncan has it...People forget Tony Parker didn't really come into his own until 2004/2005 but it was his playing with Duncan that helped him become a great NBA player....    Wade has it...I don't think too many players could've won the NBA championship with that supporting cast of his in 2006    CP3..no doubt has it, his mere presence on the floor makes the Hornets on the whole a dangerous team    T-Mac doesn't have it....there's a reason why his teams have never been out of the first round of the playoffs...T-Mac simply does NOT make his team better    Kobe doesn't have it....people keep talking about how great the Lakers are, people forget that it wasn't until Pau Gasol (an established All-Star) arrived that we started talking about the Championship aspirations of the LA Lakers....and people underestimate how the Triangle offense makes players look good....    Lebron definitely has it.....you look at the season where the Cavs made it to the NBA Finals in 2007 with Gooden, an injured Larry Hughes and Eric Snow......they managed to get there on Lebron's brilliance and on Gibson's timely shooting|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	well, today's NBA is all about individual stars on their respective teams. in the past, championship teams needed all of 5 of their starters to be excellent, but nowadays, only one or two players can carry an entire team (Lebron James in 2007, for example).|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	Nope... Put Bynum on another team and let's see if he does good. Put Stoudamire and let's see if he does good... And I do think that Marion's point per game dropped from 19 to like 8 pts. Take Kobe off the Lakers and let's see if the Lakers' triangle will still be effective. Also Tim Duncan doesn't make Parker and Ginobili better... T- Mac actually made Yao better( his avr went up since the Francis, T- Mac deal)... What I'm saying is that all the superstars in the league make other players better. Look at the Bucks, they're screwed without Redd...|`|YMh2IPWnaa	Tim Duncan does that .. Kobe does that ,, Nash and Kidd used to do that .. Wade does that .. Lebron does that .. CP and Deron does that .. so all the sucessful franchises have thier leaders making others better ..|`|jUEim6Hsaa	The reason why Kevin Garnett won his Title is because he is the ultimate complementary player he makes everyone around him better another example was DWADE who won the title with a bad MIAMI team the year he really didnt play they couldnt win 20 games its amazing what he does. Look at the Billups AI trade the nuggets are soaring with a player that makes his teamates better. This is the reason why Lebron James and Dwyane Wade are the NBAs best players NOT SELFISH players like KOBE or AI|`|P96UjJkJaa	^^ lol

I used to live in San Antonio and went to a 5-A school, it was impossible to make varsity unless you were a Senior there, then i moved to a 2-A school, and the one thing i notice, is all the freshman who go on to varsity get ZERO playing time..

8qpvfL1kaa	You have to first break in your new skates before you can skate comfortably in them. You can stroke around in them on the ice a little at a time so they kind of mold to your feet. If you walk around the house with them too much, though, they will mold to the way you walk and not the way you skate. Also, you should get blade guards if you want to walk around in your skates off ice, so your blades don't get dull as quickly.    As to maintaining them, you should get a towel or something to wipe off your skates after skating. Wiping off your blades will decrease the risk of them rusting. It's a good idea to get soakers and hard guards for your blades. Hard guards protect your blades when walking around off ice, and soakers absorb extra moisture on the blade when you store them.|`|HaDR9veDaa	get them heat molded, unless your not suppose to like w/ harlicks.  also lace them only to the third loop until they are broken in.|`|Unaaay0Caa	i used to ice skate a lot but gave it up. i remember every time i got new skates my coach would tell me wear them around the house when im watching tv or something to break them in. they are a pain when there brand new. i used to get very bad blisters. if you do get them you can put cosmetic pads or i bought these gels things that wrapped around your foot. also idk if you compete or anything but i suggest you do a few days of warm up skating before any of that, hope this helps =)|`|1dh5xbQ6aa	it depends on the skate but often times you can get them molded which makes the process of breaking them in a whole lot less painful. you can by bunga pads and granted thy are expensive i find them to be useful.|`|CibOIvbFaa	When you first purchase your skates, you should have them heatmolded so they are accustomed to your feet.  1. Bunga pads  2. Wear them around the house  3.ONLY tie your skate to the 3rd hook and not all the way to the top. Therefore your knees can bend. Then gradually tie it to the top
jTFdG8xqaa	Most twins are a more "park" style ski. Make them softer for taking impact as well as a little wider for grinding. Also the cut on the side is different (more symetrical front to back) so the bindings are normally center mounted to allow the ski to be riden backwards and forwards easily as well as making an easier platform to land on. Because of difference in shape few true "twin tips" can carve at the same speed and hold the same edge as a more traditional ski, but they are top notch in the park.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	really no big deal, twin tips are for skiing backwards.|`|dcfVXO43aa	It's just like riding a normal ski.  Twin tips just help riding switch.  I mean of course there is going to be a difference between every ski how soft it is and stuff but that's just normal.

QqQ6Hghuaa	Honeslty, Every airsoft match is different. Some events only allow you to use gas guns. Some allow spring only... There there are open matches... I think it will be in your best interested to visit your local airsoft playground and ask them what regulations they might have. In southern california, we have airsoft playground.|`|jEJxcWq5aa	They usually have the requirements stated post-op day.    But in general  ROF isn't monitored, but FPS is.    For CQB, I usually use my PM5A5 (G&G)  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  Requirements are most often below 350FPS    For Large op (Field) I use my G&G GR300L  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  Requirements are usually 400 FPS or below, 1 drum mag, 1-2 hi-cap mag's, unlimited mid-cap to standard-cap    For Pistol only, I find myself using my WE Hi Capa 5.1 Caspian, with a mixture of C02, & green gas mag's  http://www.pyramydair.com/cgi-bin/model....    For long range (snipe) I use the UTG Type 96 (Also known as L96, or MK96)  http://www.pyramidairsoft.com/ProductDet...|`|GRRpbWLoaa	Usually, the official events will list that they are for a specific type of gun; Spring, Gas, Electric, etc.  Also, most official Airsoft ranges have a limit on the velocity (fps) of the guns for the event.  I am in California and most places here limit the velocity to 360 fps or lower.  This is for safety, reasons.|`|4QyD5914aa	I use the L96 bolt action, spring airsoft sniper rifle with modded scope and bipod(520 fps)  and i use an amazing mini uzi;1000 rpm; 380 fps|`|En0SdyiTaa	I usually do indoor cqb and my gun is around 350fps.

AA11663627	Forum boots and bindings aren't nearly as popular as their boards. I don't think I know anything about their bindings for example. I have a pair of Forum boots (women's so I won't bother telling you what kind) that I like a lot. I think it's mostly about finding a pair of boots that are comfortable and have the appropriate stiffness that you require. All around though Forum's a good brand owned by Burton so most of their stuff should be decent.|`|iT5vnplHaa	bindings suck compared to rome and burton|`|7otyLHwCaa	Yeah, their fine. Not amazing, not crap. A good board. You can't really go wrong on them, if that's what you're asking...|`|5V6jEg9saa	Doesn't Burton own Forum? If so they can't be that bad of boards/bindings.
436c72228aeec32661edb2b58a2c7ffeaa	burton has a good team cause they buy their riders due to their extremely high operating budget. nitro has more riders that are hands down better than burton riders, and ride for nitro not for the money because their boards are pretty much perfect. forum libtech, and k2 have always had a loaded teams as well as smaller companies like capita, stepchild. Dont be trapped by the Big B hype machine!|`|wvJmLgKxaa	Lib-tech for sure, travis rice, mark landvik, what more could you ask for    Burton is too commercial, it turned into a big company that isnt rider driven anymore, they just care about getting more money with sponsorship.     Companies such as lib-tech, forum, technine, gnu are more rider driven|`|b3Wtnkjkaa	yeah i agree with the burton team :P   but i'd say personally i like the DC and nitro teams|`|7otyLHwCaa	This question will most likely only receive opinions...I'll generalize.

Cons: They will be expensive for just mediocre bindings    This is true for all Burton stuff.

RS3fjNboaa	I think they are good, but I didn't see them as the best this year. I'm not sure if it was because of Jason Garrett's offensive scheme or if Hudson Houck wasn't doing his job.

t4UrqK4Raa	^ That guy is completely wrong. Theres 4 long poles on the field at one time. 3 play defense 1 plays long stick middie. You do need a longpole to play defense unless your are a defensive middie but from how you described it, it sounds like your not playing d middie. Plus thats a really boring position|`|s7fUsMqoaa	no u dont theres only 3 on a team|`|ySwnTzdsaa	Yeah, first poster is an idiot. You generally need a long pole to play close defense (traditional defense), but there is also usually a defensive midfielder of the field on defense with a longpole called an LSM (Long stick middie).     Other than that, you could technically be a defensive short stick midfielder, but you really wouldn't get that much playing time.    It sounds like your coach wants you to play long stick defense, so you will probably need a D Pole and a short stick so you can switch between positions.|`|18ELgBPNaa	play with your normal stick. just to learn the position. playing d will give you great perspective on how to play better attack.  try the long shaft if tou will be playing d . it is not easy. practise with it. you will be discouraged. but perfect practise makes perfect.
OPfMoeJwaa	Of course you can!!  did you know that serena and venus didn't even play for a club or get lessons?  they were trained by their father!!  they didn't go to tennis college either!  all you have to do is train hard, have confidence!!  i want to become a pro too!!  if you believe in yourself nothing is impossible!!  maybe someday i'll verse you at the australian open!! haha|`|gWLhIoIiaa	i was under the impression that most of the pros you see didn't go to college. they went from juniors tennis straight into pro.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	play club, impress scouts,state team, impress scouts ont he state team, national side or Australian institute of sport of something(impress,train few years and go onto national side and you will be a pro|`|AA10449367	college matches and tournaments are where scouts find their talent..

RjQLB9s1aa	I have both types of racket that you mention, plus I also have a Head Radical. Personally, I do not like the Microgel as much as the Radical. The best racket though is the Aero Pro for a baseliner. So yes, I wouldn't hesitate to change from the Microgel to the Aero Pro.    I use Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Spin 16 string set at 50/52 lbs. This gives loads of power & excellent spin & control. It is an awesome  setup. Best of luck with your question.
ZAh8CEoGaa	East    125-116    LeBron James    By the time the game is finished this question would be in voting.|`|P93I8CHtaa	i hope you realize that this question can only be open for a week,and its like more than a week away until the all-star game|`|2dgVkcVAaa	EAST 134-132 WINS  King James.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	East, 133-128, Dwight Howard|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	AS it all seems: There will be no score accounted for anyone. Every point will be written under the  name of Lebron James and David Stern will award him with the MVP of the Game and the Season even before the game starts.     The game will be not next week, the next after that.. the best answer will be chosen by voters by then.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	This won't be my true prediction but I think the West will dominate once again with a win 135-127. The MVP is, of course, Kobe Bryant or it could be Chris Paul.|`|2a3a337e777a7c75d398bb5edd3f008aaa	Who cares. I seen more defense when a drunk hobo was playing a 12 year old for a quarter then you'll see that whole game.   So my answer is:   Drunk Hobo - 2 and 12 year old - 11.   The kid keeps the quarter in an upset

Fl1MqgJRaa	well buying a snowboard isn't just i'm this tall and weigh this much. There are tons of different types of boards from racing, to freestyle, to all mountain. Some things you need to consider is what are you going to do with this snowboard, and are you going to progress with it. Using the information about will give you the board size, but then you need to figure out a type of board.      When in doubt use burton, they can get expensive, but they are reliable.    This website can give you some more information on types of boards:     http://www.abc-of-snowboarding.com/snowb...|`|Xsxgn4Shaa	your about average size try this site they have a chart and stuff.
Cb5N6UaQaa	Stretch before and after any exercise. Keep  exercising every day. No weights.Jump everyday as high as you can on the hoop one day you will get there.|`|2a3a337e777a7c75d398bb5edd3f008aaa	Try palates and drink milk. If that doesn't work, try stilts.
XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...    Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:  http://www.program51.com|`|wVvfFgX5aa	i think you should try jumping exercises everyday like basically jumping and you will see the results|`|cfWKju4naa	There are different jumping programs you can do.

KHznTmpsaa	Ring around the Rosie but instead sing Ring around the swimming pool pock full of water swimmers swimmer we all and then give a command.     Red light green light. Have the kids sit on the side with their legs straight out. Have them flutter kick Green light they can try to splash you as much as possible kicking fast. Yellow light have them slow down and go and help them make sure they have straight legs and pointer toes. Red light stop. Works best for the older ones.    Fireman / Fire-girl down the pole. Take a reaching pole from the lifeguard and take the kids (well swimmers) into water just barely above there heads. Attach a diving ring to it and one at a time have them try to retrieve the ring. Say fireman fireman down the pole see how far you can go (or Fire-girl if its a girl). They should go hand over hand down the pole while you hold it.     for young swimmers you can find floating boats in your toys and have a motor boat race. Give each child a toy boat and have them stand with with their backs to the wall. When you say go they have to blow nosy bubbles all the way to the other side of the baby pool. Note do this towards the end of class then they can have free time.    Have the kids become animals. Have them act like bears and have them do the reach and pulls all the way over to the other side of baby end. Oh and make them growl to so they are acting like bears.     Oh last but not least at my pool in order to warm up the kids we do the bunny hop song. We sing Bunny hop, Bunny hop tiny little bunny hop shoulders up and shoulders down this is how we bunny hop but be careful not to fall down.     I hope this helps a little.|`|EJn3K9zjaa	Songs are fun, especially ones that progress to doing something, so sing "ring around the rosie" and after "ashes ashes.." you say we all: splash water, blow bubbles, go under water. If thats a bit young, then try races on kickboards, but call then race cars or space ships. Playing catch is also fun when waiting for other students to show up. Other types of races that focus on different swimming techniques are good, like tell them they are monkeys and that they have to use their monkey arms (free style arm movements) in order to move, then have them chase a banana. If you have diving rings, use them in (their) chest deep water. Encourage the more advanced ones to bob under to grab them while allowing the less comfortable to grab them with their feet. Also, you can have them use the rings as steering wheels and play red light green light.  Hope this helps.|`|aMlWMkO5aa	Marco Polo  Volleyball
gBO908P6aa	The choreography in the Bourne movies is indeed from Kali with JKD influence.  One thing we learned from the Bourne movies is that anything can be used as a weapon.

iYzlh5Taaa	Ya Bynum did play amazing today, and over the past 5 games he has been the Lakers leading scorer with an average of 26 pts, not Kobe. And he has also averaged 14 rbds during that stretch. At this rate he might be an All Star next year!    I don't know if the Cavs and Big Z can really handle him. He's on a rampage lol.    Ariza has developed into a great player with growing potential on both ends of the floor as well. It would be awesome if the Lakers could set up more plays for him. His Slam Dunks are beastly and he has also shown that he can be a good 3pt shooter with well set up plays.     - Sunny D|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I think that will come with time for Ariza, maybe not till next  year provided they resign him which I think they will.    Yep, 16 offensive boards for the T-pups. If the Lakers cut that in half they score 145 easy.    Bynum was a beast and there confidence in him and Ariza is growing. Must suck to be a hater, lol. I hope he takes Z to school.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Well, it's going to be a tough, hard fought game but the Lakers are going to need some luck to win in C-Town!|`|3teWTOPqaa	I hope Bynum can keep this up all year, he has really picked it up on the rebounded department lately, though I would like to see other Lakers box out a little bit more.    It's going to be a tough test for Andrew because he has not played against a tall center in the past 6 games, and Big Z is going to present some challenge to Bynum with his length.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Bynum was absolutely beastly today..

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Brandon brought up Jim Herd, perhaps someone actually worse than Russo.  Russo, at least, knows something about wrestling.  Herd was a corporate suit given the task of booking for WCW, and didn't have a clue how to go about it.  Herd didn't fail as spectacularly as Russo, nor come up with as many lame-brained ideas, so Russo still gets the nod as the worst booker.    And to set the record straight, Vince Russo didn't pioneer the "Attitude Era".  Paul Heyman did in the original ECW.  Eric Bischoff started ripping off Heyman's ideas and concepts, and used them to pull ahead of the WWF in the ratings.  Vince Russo (and Vince McMahon) then started copying and stealing from Heyman to create the "Attitude Era" in the WWF which eventually won the Monday Night Wars.    Russo WAS successful during the "Attitude Era" but Heyman was the true pioneer.  Without Paul Heyman there would not have BEEN an "Attitude Era".|`|NUehpH4yaa	don't judge someone til you have actually tried the booking job yourself|`|2KBN2lCUaa	Whatever dude, he was the brains behind Attitude Era.|`|LR3uJUswaa	TNA upper management should just fire him, and never bring Vince Russo back into TNA. The storylines that he writes and creates don't make any sense on TNA Impact, and the PPVs. Someone like Mick Foley, Jim Cornette, or someone who is really smart in writing in wrestling should be the new TNA writer.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Damm right!|`|NZKramllaa	Yes, anyone on Yahoo could do way better booking IMO than him.    and here is a simple Self Explanatory Question.    Who led to the Downfall of WCW ?    Yea, He isn't a good booker.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	well is obvious he killed wcw he is going to run tna straight to hell   i think it be better if paul heyman run tna not vince russo   tna would be better with some one who knows what they are doing|`|7ACBEowxaa	well thats a big f'n duh, look what happend to wcw, y would any company want him, jarrett and dixie are retarded for bringing him in, after what happend to wcw, mcmahon realised that early, that vince russo is a cancer of wrestling.    i say fire russo.    worst thing in wrestling history|`|aXdGCbEDaa	I'll admit that I don't have any booking experience myself,but I've read  the story lines that Russo has come up with and the majority are pretty bad.I have to agree with Michael Van Persie,TNA should fire Vince Russo and aquire Paul Heyman's services.TNA has become pretty hardcore overtime and is in need of some renovation.In my opinion,who's better for the job than Heyman?Paul Heyman helped ECW become successful,and has managed many talented wrestlers over the years.And,lets face it,the man isn't such a bad onscreen character either,and he's pretty good on the scenes as he is behind them in his own right.Good question,have a star.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	People can bury him all they want. The bottom line is Russo's job was to get eyeballs on the screen from the audience of wrestling by any means necessary. If that meant giving birth to hands, and strapping guys on crosses, and chopping of guys wangs, then so be it. He tried his best, and it worked in WWE, but failed everywhere else. I give him some credit for turning the WWF around to some degree, so no, I dont think he was the worst booker in wrestling. I think Jim Herd was. He created the Ding Dongs.
H3nbC71eaa	The original ECW did ratings in the low 1's. I'd say that was about their average..they had similar ratings to what TNA does. This was after they got on TNN though, I don't know the ratings they might've had before they scored that TNN deal on some local networks in certain markets.|`|NUehpH4yaa	ECW use to get 6.x when WCW/WWF would be gettings 9-10s    its on the ecw dvd|`|7f2GSDmqaa	The original ECW was 10x's better than TNA despite their ratings

So, the overall stats reflects very poorly indeed.    But I'll give them credit for their present status.

You probably are too young to remember but until recently most matches between most teams ended in draws,so nobody has a really high win percentage. Years ago it wasn't unusual for a 5 match test series to finish 1-0 with 4 draws.    Considering India were minnows for a long time after they started playing test matches, 22% percent sounds quite good.Probably only England  Australia and West Indies have better records, and they have all been playing much longer.|`|lckvYTdHaa	"baba" = ashish bhatia.

What is India's rankings today ? 13th (a minnow team)  Sorry,Now Australia has got only to boast about is past.

Cb5N6UaQaa	Who still listens what Shaq says and rationizes it? he speaks only huge words to grab media attention that's all. And yes, Kobe is the best partner he has had. 2nd Penny Hardaway 3rd Dwane Wade|`|xeEOTsyYaa	No.    He said him & Kob were the best 1-2 punch. When Shaq played with D-Wade, Shaq was already way past his prime, so they were obviously not as good as him & Kobe.|`|3teWTOPqaa	ever since Shaq's "rap" he has kissed up to Kobe several times, calling him one of the best ever, in that interview he even said Kobe is MVP. I think someone wants to come back to L.A.    EDIT: lol Shaq averaged 20pts and 9reb in 2006 and he was WAY out of his prime? Man I guess you started watching them after 2006.|`|EPJ2RDDOaa	what's your question?|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Ok that article is the icing on the cake for me. Not only does Shaq want to play with Kobe again, after the all star break the rumors will start to fly about a trade. Or Shaq will come back next year for one final hurrah and a shot at a ring as a Laker.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Espectro stole my words.     Snaq O Meal's mouth is as big as his appetite. He always says the dumbest things (ok they are funny but dumb), but even the big fartistotle knows that Kobe is the best and he is missing him right now because the Suns are burnt and he has no possibilities of winning a championship there. He may want to go back with the Lakers and get his 34 retired there, but he must accept to be on the bench and be  Bynum's backup first.|`|m9Zuupv1aa	I agree. Way better than Shaq-Wade combo. MVP is on the rocks but Kobe is not as far behind LeBron as many people make it out to be. I think they could have easily had 5 titles by now.
7rpILeYtaa	im not saying he is.  i have been saying HBK vs JBL at WM ever since the storyline started      i think that Triple H will face Taker at WM for the WWE title, after Triple H wins it off Edge.  and this reason is because i think they will be making Christian return in the weeks leading up to WM. and now that Matt is on SD. im guessing they will have: Edge and Matt vs Christian and Jeff, hopefully we get to see another great TLC match|`|KIOR56r6aa	Because of this :    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQqs5K9JQ...|`|7ACBEowxaa	dream match|`|j9GokH9Qaa	It's what people want.. It would be a great match... they are both Texans... and Wrestlemania is going to be in Texas.. They are both Legends.. been in the WWE since the first ever Raw episode.. It's like a dream match..I guess WWE changed plans.. now its most likely to be JBL vs HBK =[|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Its merely a dream match that everyone wants. It would make sense because it would be two legendary wrestlers, doing what they do best and what place would be better then their home state of Texas. I would love to see this match, being that they have wrestled before but never against each other at WM. It would be interesting to see if Undertaker would continue his win streak or if they will finally give Shawn a title since he hasnt had one for a while.|`|BglekVnQaa	Because it would be a blockbuster match between two of The WWE's living legends and because both are from Texas. Also because both of them have had their moments especially the one when Taker talked to HBK backstage before the Royal Rumble Match.    '' Sometimes it's hell getting to heaven."|`|H7p09fL2aa	that's what everyone wants since they have never had a wrestlemania match  and they don't have much time left in wrestling  so what better place than texas?|`|GJQIL0RZaa	They keep teasing it LOL.|`|plhLIIeAaa	Look for JBL and HBK to face off at WM, and Taker to get his streak continued. It doesn't matter who he faces, but if it is for the title, he will get it.|`|siKXdBEWaa	i heard that it will be fatle for way for wwe title and taker will be 16/1 at WM not sure. but from the same person i heard that ted debeacity will win the money in the bank match.  the money in the bank match will happen before the wwe tittle match   if ted wins then it is probably true|`|lTlaNwtgaa	it's more like hbk vs jbl
E7TkNO00aa	ECW should have the same world title belt as the other 2 brands.  The Undertaker should face Edge once more for the title, but if not, there should be a match made between him and Umaga since he is back.  Raw and Smackdown don't argue because both brands have good wrestlers, and let's not forget ECW.|`|Tsv6zyawaa	WWE just needs to change its rating!|`|1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	1.  It is not a World Title.  ECW is not considered by anybody to be equal to RAW and Smackdown.  ECW is considered a "developmental" show for the new wrestlers to learn how to be a WWE "Superstar".  The big-names in the WWE do not challenge for that title.  Nor is an ECW Title match ever the main event at a PPV.    2.  Most seem to think it will be Shawn Michaels, but I disagree.  I think Michaels will face JBL at Wrestlemania to end their storyline.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Kozlov will get the match with the Undertaker.  Kozlov will remain undefeated and then put his streak on the line against the Undertaker's at Wrestlemania.    3.  Because RAW and Smackdown are no longer in competition with each other.  They were when there was no outside competition, but now there is TNA to provide the competition.  So all three brands are cooperating as one unit to turn back the challenge from TNA.|`|GJQIL0RZaa	Yes    HBK|`|7rpILeYtaa	1. No. i dont think it is considered a world title, its not as respected as the WWE title and WH title    2. Triple H for the WWE title    3. i think its because of the PG era|`|KIOR56r6aa	1. yes  2. HBK  3. IDK|`|TWQNYhVVaa	They don't say it but I would consider it one  HBK  I don't know..they should have more Raw vs SD..

YBpjA72faa	At a Flyers game, the announcer said that if the Flyers score 4 goals in a game, everyone in attendance gets a free chicken sandwich at Chik-Fil-A. Then, the guy sitting in front of me said, "Yeah, and if Brashear scores, everyone in the stands gets 10,000 bucks."|`|qaHM2mIlaa	The people sitting behind me were talking about doughnuts, doesn't get any more random than that!|`|NrbLdZzOaa	I was at a game in Buffalo last year and the couple behind me was wondering why Hasek wasn't starting.

It was cute and hilarious!  Made the morning for us sleep deprived, butt freezing parents!    Feb 28 - Dallas @ San Jose -  usually makes for a great game.|`|axxQzOCHaa	My local CHL team has a promotion in which if they score 4+ goals in a game, you can redeem your game ticket for a Jumbo Jack (it's Jack in the Box's version of the Big Mac) awhile back they were close to getting 8 goals - I heard someone say to their neighbour, "wonder if we can get 2 burgers?"    Bonus: (can I nominate three?)  Sunday's game in Montreal between the Canadiens and Bruins; it's important Price get back on track.    Wednesday Feb. 25 will be another key game (Sharks at the Joe vs. the Red Wings)    Saturday Feb. 28 as well (Sharks at the Bell Centre vs. the Habs)|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	Someone compared Pavel Datsyuk to Vincent Lecavalier..|`|G33E41IBaa	I was at a Devils game and a girl was telling her friend how she wanted to get implants so that Zach Parise will notice her, and I was just thinking, "Wow, if those get ANY bigger the players won't even be able to see your face."    I'm looking forward to the Devils/Sharks game on the 15th (I'm going!)  The Sharks are my favorite team in the West, and my second favorite team, so I can't wait to see them play.  Hopefully the Devils still beat them!|`|FEIXGtQyaa	When I was at the Penguins vs Lightning game on December 23, the whole game I heard "You could have been a hero, Malone - but you left for more money" and other random things being yelled to him.    Other funny things that I heard during a game were whether or not to get up again to use the bathroom, because they had already walked past us probably 9 times each period. & Then those same people went into the bar at the Mellon Arena that night and wanted to walk out, with their glasses, and couldn't understand why the bar wouldn't allow them too......|`|YTwnVAtdaa	I was at a Devils game and some kid behind me was screaming "GET THE BALL, GET THE BALL"  i was like WTF its a PUCK!!!    also i paint my whole face for devils games and we were at a Devils vs Flyers game and i was like skippinglol and a bunch of flyers fans pointed at me and they were like "There she is" and i just gave them the nasty look and they shut up lol.
6e083f2ba7e3043fb68160d6bfe280dcaa	Babe Ruth led the AL in home runs in 1918 with 11, and again in 1919 with 29 and was still a starting pitcher for the Boston Red Sox.  According to Babe Ruth's biography, Manager Ed Barrow asked Ruth what he wanted to do? Ruth told Barrows that he "sure liked to hit." From that day on he became a full time outfielder. The rest is history.  The Babe won 93 regular season games and was 3-0 in the World Series, with a 2.28 lifetime ERA.  Many baseball experts believe that had Ruth been a full time outfielder for those five years he was a pitcher, there's a good chance he could have hit over 800 regular season homers.     But then most also agree because of his great pitching record, that adds to the belief that Babe Ruth was the greatest "all-around" ball player.|`|jGgOVd5Zaa	I heard he developed arm troubles, but I don't have a source on that.  I read a biography when I was a kid.  He always was a good hitter (remember there was no DH then).  He was a really good pitcher, probably Hall of Fame caliber, but maybe not 'elite' Hall of Fame.|`|nES0J88oaa	Ruth is considered one of the great pitchers of his era... BUT  Pitchers don't play everyday, and offense wins games in baseball.  He was such a good hitter they couldn't afford to keep his bat out of the lineup for three fourths or more of the season|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	The Red Sox had a lot of pitching and he became known around the club for his hitting during batting practice. It's amazing how he was such a great pitcher and immediately became the best hitter of all time. He is the legend of baseball.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Well he was considered a very good pitcher, and then his hitting ability was discovered.  Since pitchers can't play every game, he switched to the outfield to accommodate his bat.|`|dKh3vqq9aa	he swiched teams, red sox to yankees|`|p7ZgSPIDaa	I llllooovvvveee kung fu!|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	One day he was drinking, then as a drunk mad man he picked up a bat and started swinging it around the hotel lobby where his manager discovered he had an awsome swing.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	It became pretty obvious by 1919 that Ruth was an exceptional hitter, and the Red Sox manager wanted to get his bat into the lineup every day. I think Ruth's ego played a part in that too, as he probably demanded the switch, at least on his off-days. Ruth was a handful in that time period; indeed, he was a bit of a problem for managers throughout his career.    Below is a review of a biography on the Babe; Leigh Montville did a nice job on it.

dqPdoiSYaa	Nah, I dont think so.  I am sure Australia will have a lot of things improved in their playing by the time that series is played. They need some capable replacements to the players who have not been able to perform in this series.  And actually, they didnt choke in this series. South Africa was just brilliant and they won it themselves. Yes I Agree that Australia were  performing pretty averagely in this series, but now they've gotta forget this series and start rebuilding themselves for the tour of South frica next month and try and regain the top spot again.|`|bbf096ad6f74d4fe631cb97301e1a43baa	I think it'll be the same result as it was in Australia.

Got a cozy little job selling the Mexican mob  Packages the candycaine    He's the one they call Dr. Feel good  He's the one that makes ya feel all right  He's the one they call Dr. Feel good|`|t2Ns8Tcoaa	Hopefully another cracker of a test series again, the one here could have swung either way, though we gave SA some of the games with our bad catching and ordinary batting through the middle order.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	South Africa at home are really strong.  So you're right they will choke.|`|3AJeuo0qaa	If they get rid of the selectors and have a better advisor for Ponting then they will go well.    My team would be Hughes, Jacques, Katich, Ponting, Clarke, McDonald, Haddin, Krezja, Johnston, Siddle, Bollinger (Lee would replace Bollinger on the Ashes series if fit) or I would leave out Bollinger and play Hussey if they are worried about the batting. Ryan Harris and Nathan Bracken would be my back up bowler as SA wickets would not suit Hilfenhaus.    The one day bowlers have been even worse than our batsmen. They are undisciplined rabble bowling without any plan or common sense. And our one day tail is way too long. More all-rounders who bowl to a plan, please!!!|`|AA11088802	yes y not,, that will be  a chance for revenge,|`|0IuWhmWUaa	Yeah i say that we are gonna suffer.  Retirements and injuries are just screwing us over.  Give us another 2 years, and we will be good again.|`|ocPlxCIeaa	RSA Will Will Again,  Hope that Aus Will Do Better.    Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Hopefully, they will improve. For one thing, early wicket Hayden won't be there so hopefully we can look at good starts. The bowling may be where the problem will lie. The Proteas bowlers (with the exception of Harris) do cause our batsmen a lot of trouble. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we have bowlers to upset the Proteas.    Dictator, at least SA were able to beat us at home.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Australia only choked in the 1st two ODI's.. Other than that url where never in any position to win a match in both the test and ODI series. South Africa were simply better.. Outstanding infact.    Australia will have to up their game drastically if they will want to try and compete with South Africa in South Africa. The big guns like Pointing, Hussey and Clarke will have to lead by example by posting big scores to help their inexperienced bowling attack try and defend that as well as take the pressure of the new batsman in the team|`|cZiXchO0aa	Not so much choke but loose to a much better side, they might win one test|`|c55c5f3a196f9a316536bb93ba268636aa	They will go by air in a plane.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	I don't think they have it in them.|`|mtw2KqY8aa	Yes mate you are going to choke again. India has trashed your team and SA is picking up from where India left them. Your team ain't good now mate. Ponting should go home.|`|R3Ymde7saa	Not too different from the last series. I'd expect a very similar series result.

And Goddammit, he's earning $15,000,000 a year, he needs to actively contribute. You may think that oh wow, he got +27, he's great. Truth is, the Cavs are really good, and he plays significant minutes, so as the Cavs rack up points and destroy the other team, he stands out there and makes no impact on the game. On the Cavs today, every starter got at least +20.  His stats on the season: 3.3 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 1.6 BPG    Looks like a real contributor to me.|`|Is7WnDKAaa	one thing i love about Big Ben.  he knows what his role is.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	I still think the Cavs need a better power foward.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	( slow clap )|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Yeah, he has Dennis Rodman touch.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Ben does not amaze me.

And what's more amaZAzing is that he is the highest player on the Cleveland Cavaliers roster. right in front of 'Bron 'Bron.      BQ: they sure can.

I mean dude is just awesome he can talk and can back it up.|`|NQkRzBtJaa	Chris Jericho is my favourite wrestler for many reasons. For one he was raised in Canada which is where I'm from so he represents my country quite well in the WWE. Secondly he is very entertaining to watch in the ring because he mixes up his style he goes from a high flyer to a mat wrestler during a match which a lot of wrestlers aren't able to do. Thirdly he is amazing on the mic which causes him to cut great promos which makes a even bigger hype to his matches. Fourthly I respect him that he was wrestled all over the world in various wrestling promotions. He has gone everywhere from Mexico to Japan and from ECW to WCW to the WWE. Fifthly I think that it is great that Chris is able to be a great heel and draw a lot heat from the fans but he can also play a huge baby face and bring cheers from the entire crowd as well. Being able to be a heel and a face is a great talent to have which makes you be a great superstar. Chris Jericho all around has it all which makes him a very successful WWE superstar. He makes watching the WWE a very entertaining experience for me.
6en8QlaUaa	I think the reason you're getting stupid answers is because all of these guns are very different and it's a hard task to pick a best one without knowing what you're looking for in a firearm.    I'll try and answer your question the best way I can.    Because these guns are so different I'll split up my choices into more than 1 category.    The PSG-1 AND M-24 are dedicated sniper rifles  To a lesser extent the M16A2 fits into this category.    The M16A2 is an excellent short range sniper rifle but the light weight bullets make it more susceptible to wind than the other two. (7.62)    The PSG-1 is an excellent sniper rifle, probably one of the best in the world but it is a very heavy rifle that is a beast if you have to hump it in the forest or jungle.    The Remington M24 is probably the best pure sniper rifle here because it is a bolt action that doesn't eject brass like the PSG-1.  It is a Remington which means that reliability is a given.    In this category (Sniper)  I think the Remington is the best in the class.    Now as far as the rest of these guns go.  They're all military style rifles that have their applications.  You really can't go wrong with any of these but....  If you're looking for reliability, The AK47 is probably your best bet here. That and the 7.62x39 has more knock down power than any of the 5.56mm ones here.    Of all of the 5.56 ones, I would take the G36 simply because outside of the U.S., more countries have adopted the G36 as their weapon of choice.    So that leaves us with 3 weapons here.  The AK47... The G36 and the M24.    As you can see it is incredibly hard to pick just one because of the great differences.    Truth be told, if someone said they would give me any of these guns and I could pick only one. I would pick the PSG-1  because it is the coolest looking and the most expensive.    I hope this helped you a little.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	Whichever one fits into a given situation at hand the best.    If you're asking which one we prefer to the others, I have to go with the AK-74. Preferably an AK-74M.   Light weight, folding stock (on the AK-74M), good accuracy, uses a small, yet one of the most combat effective cartridges, and it's based directly on the design of the AK-47, the receivers are stamped, has a loose internal design, and is factory produced, giving it extraordinary durability and reliability. In my opinion, nothing beats an Izhmash.    You obviously know jack about the M16A2, and firearms in general.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Oh god, you just asked "who makes the best".    You're going to get 99 answers that list 101 brands, makes, and models.    Also, best for what?    Hunting game? Hunting birds? Home defense? Police work? Military work?    This is an overly broad question that can be difficult to answer.|`|AA11729094	If you add another 30 or 40 question marks, people will answer.|`|b1f68fe4a7602cd05ee10c7b596c5a1baa	Every weapon you have listed has it's own set of advantages and disadvantages.  Other than snipers in some circumstances; soldiers do not fight as individuals but are part of an unit that has a mix of arms and a tactical doctrine that makes (hopefully) the best use of them.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	PSG1 is the best gun for accuracy    Ak47 is the most dependable at spraying lead    MP5 is the best for police entry, tight quarters work.    The rest are really good battle rifles, not one you named is sub par.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* M-14 or M1 Garand.*|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	None of them????????????????????????????????????...|`|dpSr0icwaa	none of them    nothing like a wild apples-to-oranges comparison|`|df6057d677c3c41e9db74174acc677acaa	They all have their purposes. There is no "best gun."|`|9QHwLQEraa	I personally like the Ak's. I like the look and feel but i guess this question depends on preference.

oBuyR3LEaa	I was in Massachusettes...Brockton, MA.  Yeah, that's the place.  I get in the gym and look around.  In one of the two rings were two guys shadow boxing...you know just moving with one another.  Some older guy threw combos against the heavy bag.  I sat and watched, visiting from Virginia.  A suit walks in and introduces himself.  I tell him my fight experience, and he thinks I'm a fake.  Any how, he takes me around the gym telling me who's on the wall, and who's hitting the bag.  It was one of Hagler's old sparring partners.  Marvin's.     Then this guy walks in.  Bright guy, friendly, the kind of guy you'd give a hug, and I'm thinking I know this guy.  He talks a bit to the suit, takes a couple more steps and now he's talking to another trainer.    Meanwhile maybe four or five other older gentleman walk in and straight to the back room.     I say "I know that guy."  the suit says "who? that guy?  Oh yeah? From where?"  I'm not sure yet, but I know this guy. lol.  then it hits me.  I say to the guy that I recognize "On your head," I'm pointing to the top of my head, and I say "the birth mark."  The guy lights up, and smiles.   It was "Reggie Simms Hagler"  Marvelous Marvin's younger brother.  I'll never forget it.  He shakes my hand, we talked a bit more and then he was gone to the back room too.  Now it's me and the suit again, and this guy just thinks that I'm lieing about everything, so as a test he says "ok, tell that to Goody"    that's right "Goody Petrolleni" it's still his gym, home of Marvelous, Reggie Simms, and yes "Rocky Marciano" and there I stood, in Petrolleni's office with all these guys that go down in boxing history, plus with a up and coming young fighter, who was due to fight the next day.  Thank you so much for that question...|`|xlyk63xRaa	i will always remember when i waited up all night to watch the fight between lennox lewis and hasim rahman, for all of lewis's belts at that rumble in the jungle, in some mountains the venue was at.  i loved to watch lewis fight and i had never seen a PPV fight before, so my dad told me to go to bed and he would wake me at 4 AM but i didnt want to risk missing my first PPV, i had massive hopes in lennox, and then i watched hasim rahman just drop lewis big time, really knocked him out with a perfect punch lol i was well annoyed|`|uoZIYhJtaa	In the late 1960s, when Muhammad Ali was stripped of his title and banned from boxing, he went around the country giving speeches at college campuses. One he gave was at a college here in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I went to see him.    At the time, Ali was in his late 20s and he gave a VERY impressive speech. He was articulate, intelligent and humorous. The audience lapped it up.    After the speech, a group of us surrounded Ali asking him questions. I asked him if could beat Joe Frazier. Ali looked at me and said, "If Joe Frazier even DREAMS he can beat me, he should apologize."    Ali WAS the greatest!|`|jRMvaeKAaa	Mine would be my first ever Heavyweight amateur bout. I was really nervous and looking around the place. When i saw the guy i had to fight, i got really intimidated. Big fella. Very bulky and had tattoos over his body. When i got into the ring, the guy charged at me. He threw quite alot of punches and i just blocked and moved, trying to clear my head. The second round i saw the guy looked a bit tired. I don't know how i did it, but when the guy threw a right, i ducked and threw an over-hand right flush on the guys jaw. The guy dropped. He stood back up and looked lost, then his corner threw in the towel. I was just so bloody happy.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Never even made it to the amateurs in boxing.  But I had some good sparring session.  I had a backyard brawl with a 6'7" version of Thomas Hearns in which the punches were sizzling through the air in the same manner a dodgball whizzes by my head.  I had purpley and yellowy bruises on my hips, elbows, wrists and forehead from the shots I absorbed with my arms.  Got hit in the side twice and was effectively paralyzed and had to quit before the grim reaper stepped in to stop it.  As much as a beating I took, I was fairly proud considering this guy could win street fights in 2 seconds.  I begged him to take up the sport, he was a natural athlete, but he basically had social anxiety disorder.  He couldn't perform athletically in front of an audience, but he could beat the hell out of a friend in boxing gloves or leave someone for dead in a streetfight.    The night Leonard beat Hagler was big for me.  I was a HUGE Ray Leonard fan, and I was fairly terrified that Hagler was going to knock his eyeballs loose.  I didn't sleep that night.  When Ray pulled it out, i couldn't get the adrenalin to stop pumping.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I was at the Cruz-Miranda fight in Tulsa and I had a great time. Me and my girlfriend always frequent the MMA events but this was our first time at a boxing match live. We got third row seats and a great view of the action, and the fights were great from my vantage point. The Quintero-Casal fight was my favorite, a nice little war. I was somewhat dissapointed in Miranda's performance, but the knockout from Cruz was incredible. I plan on making the trip up to OKC to see the fights at Remington Park on Valentines Day. My girlfriend is really buzzing about it and we are going to take her little brother (he is nine) to his first boxing event, and the kid is going crazy about it.|`|G3qvhydCaa	Last night I won my first fight in the State tournament i got a black swollen eye, fat lip, messed up nose but i still won so it's not to bad.
k6M48eUMaa	Well, it comes on at that time because it is live at 3.30am. And they don't start the "headline" matches (the big stars, etc) until around 7.30pm (Australian time) to get more TV Viewers and more people attending the match.

Don't act all high and mighty though I'm sure you are just as biased as any other sports fan.|`|gqoIfbH0aa	Yes, very irritated.    For example.    I don't HATE the Lakers.    I mostly hate the bandwagoner, unreasonable, prepubescent fans they have.

I used to get it mixed up with the french league, anyway it is the Top league in Spain equivelant to England's Premiership league.   The only thing making that league interesting is Barcelona, quite possibly the sweetest team on Earth at the moment. It get's borin' when Madrid win it year in year out especially when Barcleona clearly have been the best team for a number of years now. Anyway, if anything the Italian league (Serie A) is getting much better now as Juventus are back i business and Milan have such a huge squad, it was getting tirin' when Inter were doin the same thing as Madrid over in Spain, but now theres more spice involved and that league is more up for grabs than anything. Hope this nonsense helped, oh yeah and Man United will retain The Premiership and The Champs league!!!!|`|LhCGU3F1aa	Long answer short, its a Spanish League, an awesome team, Real Madrid, plays in it!|`|IjV8hlE0aa	My friend, "La Liga" or in spanish: The Primera Divisin of the Liga de Ftbol Profesional (Professional Football League), commonly known as La Liga or Liga BBVA, is the top professional football league in Spain.

8wmjYlfaaa	Steelers will win the toss, but will insist the Cardinals take the choice.  the Cardinals, shocked by their actions, will secretly put a smoke bomb in the football.So its the kick-off, and when the Cardinals kick returner catches the ball, he will run until about the 15, then the coach will press a button, releasing the smoke, and all of the blockers will illegally hit the defenders so they get injured.and the score will be 7-0.  there is my answer, now read it, and completely forget i ever said that.    P.S-The Steelers will win the toss, kick return it to the 23, make three 1st downs, and punt it at the....42 yard line.|`|2scuBnf3aa	Steelers win coin toss, choose to receive and run it back to the 28, gain 1 first down to their own 45 yard line, punt    Okay not creative, but still my guess!|`|981f0a6a977e8d11dd72df8cf1f00533aa	Arizona will win the coin toss and choose to receive, and they will kick a field goal for a 3 to 0 lead.|`|w8n5sCA4aa	Cards will win the coin toss and choose to recieve (who doesn't??)

They will then defer to the 2nd half so they can get the ball after halftime.    Cardinals opening drive will result in a missed field goal which will cause them to look at their back up kicker the rest of the way.  They won't do that though, which will be their downfall because the regular kicker will miss another FG later.    Score after the opening drive....0-0    The Steelers, due to deferring, will get the ball to start the 2nd half and return the KO for a TD...|`|6CyScIKBaa	steelers will win the coin toss and elect to recieve and will gett and 4 first downs with a td|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Cardinals win the coin toss get the ball to the 27.

yk4S7uuraa	The last few years, Jose Reyes has motivated the Phillies. Their players hate him, their announcers are always ragging about him, and the Phillies fans hate Jose also.     Jimmy Rollins should be motivating the Mets in the same way, with his mouth, his comments, and his body language, and for some reason that hasn't happened; and that needs to change this year. If it does, the Mets will win 105 games, and that's someplace where the Phillies won't be able to walk.    As for Myers, he's trash, and if that's what they chose to typify their city, then that alone should tell you something.    Anyway, put this garbage to rest, and Go Mets!!!|`|f8ed328242d905d1e234676aa09ce11faa	Fans of any Philly team are pretty much retarded.|`|NOEJMDfiaa	I agree with Utley. Right now the Phillies are the defending champs. Spring training hasn't even started so you shouldn't be trash talking until later in the season.      EDIT: First, the Eagles losing has nothing to do with the Phillies' 2009 MLB season. The NFL doesn't affect the MLB. Of course it counts in the post season, and guess what? The Phillies played very well in the post season.    EDIT2: Just so you guys know, I am not a Phillie fan.    EDIT3: As Utley said, you can't be certain that is what will happen. The '07 Rockies, '08 Phillies, '08 Yankees, '08 Rays, and '08 Mariners all played very differently from what was expected. Don't close the door on any team until the season gets underway.|`|K2mZFWf5aa	Yes Phillies fans think it is sick and stupid like the mets|`|RW7qVMk5aa	i dont see any reason for a philly fan to start knocking cubs fans. We as fans, appreciate the team always, Philly fans, Well, basically they're Phair Weather Phans.   Dont take the frustrations of knowing that you became lucky and somehow won the world series and won't win one again until several years after utley and both howard are gone.    But yeah, philly fans get to complain and moan about k rod's drama queen antic's, then they can cry when he shuts the door on them in games after he walks 2 guys, then misfields a grounder to load the bases and strikes out the side to end the game.|`|ikf0UN36aa	first of all u dont put on a big celabration until u win and when reyes scores he puts on a 10 minute show for no reason brag when u win not in the middle of the 5th ok and that one time against the phillies he said number 1 well it looks like the phillies where number one for good|`|L77OlY1naa	I hope Reyes puts his foot in Hamels mouth wait and see if the mets get manny lol he will put his foot in rollins a++|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I love jose too and i think hes apart of getting us energized. I know what u mean with rollins but we cant say much cuz hell they are the champians as plain and simple as that.|`|ivbnPxSKaa	mets suck and reyes is overated|`|c3tADklmaa	Let's compare Rollins and Reyes's celebration. Yeah, way different. And people like you always say how Myers suck by beating his wife. Is that all you know? This is baseball, not life crisis.    edit: Oh wow, if you don't know what the players are like unless your a Phillies phan. We boo whenever they don't try their best, your sparkplug is a hot dog.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Bring it on.  Wait until October and then let's see him celebrate.      edit:  You Mets fans are so funny.  Two years of choking and you already need to make yourself feel better by trashing the Phillies.  Too bad you weren't a Cubs fan or you'd have cracked by now.  All I know is that the Phillies won the World Series in 2008.  What does that tell you?    P.S.  the Phillies lost last in '93 not '83    edit again:  I'm an Eagles fan too, and I'm not afraid to say that they didn't even deserve to make the play-offs.  Injuries were a factor, of course, and we had some good breaks.  But I'm not going to place games on a "gift."  The Eagles were and are a decent team, but I'm not afraid to say that the better team won.  Why bring football into this?    edit AGAIN: "going down the drain"???  Look, let's just wait until the season starts, okay?  I'm done.    edit YET AGAIN:  Alex- I'm not knocking the Cubs!  I respect their fans and the team a LOT.
x6OsAvQeaa	San Jose Sharks. They have the best group of forwards in the game, better than Detroit in my mind. Thornton and Marleau down the middle gives them awesome size and strength. On the wings are underated guys like Cheechoo, Clowe and Setoguchi. On defence, there is mobility (Boyle, Blake and Vlasic) and awesome size and strength (Murray and Semenov). Nabokov in goal isn't the best in the game, but he's up there. With a team that yields about 25 to 26 shots per game, theres not a whole lot of work for a guy like Nabokov to do. But hes on edge as of late, posting shutouts over Phoenix and Colorado. The last goal he has allowed was against Vancouver. He only faced 14 shots in that game. He is tied with Tim Thomas of Boston for Points Percentage by a goalie (.806), but I would take Nabokov any day over Thomas. This has got to be the year for San Jose. They have way too much talent to be ignored. And if they finish first overall in the NHL, which I think is very realistic, they will have home ice advantage throughout the playoffs. And thats a huge advantage, given San Jose's 23-1-2 home record. That's only one regulation loss on home ice. Some people say the Sharks aren't playoff experienced. That's untrue. San Jose added Brad Boyle and Rob Blake on defence this past summer. Both are proven Stanley Cup Champions. Boyle won the Cup with Tampa Bay in 2004 and Blake with the Avalanche in 2001. The only team that can beat San Jose in the playoffs is Detroit. Although I really doubt that Detroit will be able to do that, should both teams meet in the playoffs. San Jose is the stronger team in my mind.|`|Fh0shlVLaa	I say Devils are the hottest team right now.|`|6be9290f60153f3e3a975ebd1d958f34aa	Well right "NOW" its the Sharks.  YES!  And right behind them (-1 point) it is Boston.    There you have it.  You cant get any more technical than that!|`|kj48Bl3faa	THE DEVILS ARE!!!!!  THEY ARE TAKING THE CUP!!!!!!!!|`|OMSulG6aaa	boston|`|TjpWZImGaa	Devils or Flames|`|12xQlgr7aa	Detroit Red Wings. They got all the Swedes.|`|ptymI7Vbaa	sj sharks!!!|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Devils are very hot! They are a solid team with the greatest goalie Martin  Brodeur and Scott Clemmensen has filled in nicely|`|TsRgRLuiaa	lol im going to say the Capitals  go alex ovechkin! lol|`|64LZW2y8aa	As much as I hate to say it, as a Habs fan, the Boston Bruins are the best team in hockey now. Here are a few reasons why:    1. They've got two starting goaltenders, in my opinion.  2. They've got three lines that can score. When you have Lucic, Savard, Kessel, Krejci, Wheeler, Bergeron, Ryder, Sturm, etc..., you know you've got a great team.  3. They're defense is great, even though they don't have big name guys other then Chara, they're still good.    So, to me, even though I hate to say it, the Boston Bruins are the best team in hockey right now.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	The Sharks, Bruins and Flamers.|`|57d4f2697917e4b39ee6da4458cc830eaa	The team with the highest winning percentage (possible points taken) since Dec. 15 is Calgary at 80.56% (the only team above 80%)  Positions 2 - 10 are BOS, NJ, SJ, WAS,DAL, DET,FLA,CLS, and  MTL in 10th position with 57.50%  (It looks like Columbus will finally make the playoffs. Dallas too. Vancouver is probably out.)|`|YajYjjxLaa	I'm just going by what the standings say:  East-Bruins 76 pts  West- Sharks 77 pts  NHL-Sharks    Them two play each other Febuary 10th|`|hMo9z0TSaa	Bruins or the Sharks

AA11674745	Kind of.    The Cardinals started in Chicago, merged with the Steelers for one season (1944), moved to St. Louis in 1960, then to Phoenix in 1988 and changed their name to "Arizona" in 1994. They won the NFL Championship in 1925 and 1947.    The Coyotes started out as the Winnipeg Jets in 1972, joined the NHL in 1979, and moved to Phoenix in 1996. They won the WHA Avco Cup in 1975, 1977, & 1978.|`|qaHM2mIlaa	Haha!    GO STEELERS!|`|r5V3ZNGfaa	I think it's---    .....................    Well..........    .....................    Actually..........    ............................    GO STEELERS!    :b|`|NuA4icLNaa	Here's what they have in common:    1. In Glendale (duh!)  2. Good  3. Exceepding expectations this year  4. Playoff bound, the Coyotes will be, and the Cardinals are already there, maybe Super Bowl Champs    But here's the difference between the Coyotes and the Cardinals...  The Cardinals won the conference while the Coyotes might fall short to a team in hockeytown or in TEAL!! :)    But who knows!!|`|OMSulG6aaa	cardinals+fitzgerald=superbowl win|`|1ApbWVhsaa	Well......  1.Gretzky played with an Adam Graves....and the GM of the Cards is named Rod Graves.  2.They both play in the state of Arizona....eerie  3.They both came from cities that hadn't won a title(St Louis Cards & Winnipeg Jets)  4.Shane Doan has played for 11 seasons in Phoenix..Kurt Warner has played 11 seasons in the NFL.  5.Waynes' wife Janet made headlines for gambling.Kurts' wife Brenda made headlines when he was in St Louis for being a "Jesus freak" and ripped head coach Martz for his play calling.
dlqa6yFkaa	I think we will see more of him, he has just started working with Gil, the guy who used to do Andre Agassi's fitness training. During the off season Verdasco went to the US, met up with Gil and got stuck into it and it has already paid off so the more he trains with Gil the more improvement we will see and that will make him  more of a risk  to the top players.    Gil worked with Andre for 18 yrs and was at every one of his matches. Andre always credited Gil for keeping him going long after he was past it. If Gil does half as much for Verdasco it will be an interesting year of tennis.|`|GNtWomekaa	No, I believe he is the real deal  judging by the way he played against Nadal last night  he can really threaten those on top  if he can challenge the number 1 to such a great game  he has alot of potential|`|iD3XXaMOaa	Well he is the World No.14. Once the new rankings are released, he will be moving up further. He has improved him game a lot and has worked hard to get where he has. So, he cant be a flash in the pan. He couldnt have come so far in a day's work. Its a culmination of his round the year hard work and dedication. Give him his due.    Yesterday's match showed the guy's heart and mentality for a fight. He went down fighting unlike some players who just give up when the going gets rough against pushers like Nadal. I think he is one for the future. Nadal might still continue to dominate but Verdasco will definitely move into Top 10 and be a real threat in the years to come. He is the real deal.|`|MQaXTUQRaa	no I believe friom watching him withstand a 5 hour match, he is more than just some flash...I think he will continue to make his way up the rankings.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	hard question, But yeahh he will do well but he will hit the top 10 and then drop like gonzalez, baghdatis and mabny others|`|HlFCd3yvaa	Every year we have a flash in the pan....Gonzales, Tsonga, then Verdasco and Roddick, too...thats the league of the second chargers which had come up at the Australian Open for the last three (3) years....Tennis is really that way. Everytime a player or two hits his prime, then there's a FLASH IN THE PAN......and this is what we really like....and enjoy!.....|`|AA11011163	no way....he will sustain and be one of the best and definitely one of the remembered after what he took Rafa to in the semis|`|k6M48eUMaa	No, I think hes for real.  Most "flash in the pan" players as you call it, will have one lucky run at a grand slam, or another major tournament, and then have no other real good results. Fernando has been playing very well for a while now, he won Davis Cup, made the final in Brisbane and won quite a few matches in Kooyong and of course, the Australian Open.   I think we should expect big things from him in the future. He is an amazing player.   As of February 2nd, He will be ranked number 9 in the world.
gBO908P6aa	Nope there is no shortcut.  Sorry bud.  It takes time and practice, working on the Thai pads and heavy/banana bag.  Eventually you will develop enough conditioning in the shins to take the impact.  Believe me it still hurts even seasoned Thai boxers sometimes, they just don't show it on their faces.  Instead they kick smarter by setting up their kicks with combinations and strategy.|`|onkUcy19aa	A lot of practice, especially mental conditioning.|`|LuHN1PJKaa	it takes time, years

WiNKL5z9aa	Hmmm, attitude era overated, edge spearing jeff hardy off a ladder overated? stone cold steve austin coming down to vince mcmahon and the rock , spraying them with a truck full of beer and embarrassing them , overated? , DX taking over the show, overated?? Times when the WWE Divas were so good that some could go in the royal rumble,   do you get my point???? The Hell in a Cell was made in the Attitude era, The 4 faces of foley, the greatest tag teams, the greatest match types, the greatest superstars that have gone onto having their own tv sshows, and their own movies, becoming legends, the undertaker and kkane feud, the Tables ladders and Chairs Feud, everything was great bback then, overated? dont make me laugh|`|D8a0X3oAaa	To put it straight!  What wwe is doing right now is attracting kids in this era to get them hooked on it. Then, they will switch back to a minor attitude era.  That way we both get what we want.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I think abit of both to be honest, Attitude was overrated brawling with a lot of gimmick matches and DQ finishes but at the same time they are taking the PG too far is some areas.    On the whole i think PG will be a good if not great era for proper wrestling matches and feuds, they just don't need to take it too far. It can be kid friendly without obvious child marketing like hornswoggle! Wrestling doesn't need the bimbos or the swearing to be entertaining, blood is needed but only for certain times not all the time like in attitude... dulled the effect it had, Chris Jericho's current promo's aren't childish are they?     The WWE has a few problem's they need to work on but they are much deeper than just the rating, the rating is blamed far too much for thing's with aren't anything to do with PG. Cena would be a champion in any era because he puts people in the arena's and sells his tshirts!|`|T13xM9iJaa	I think we all need just realized the fact the attitude era only happened to beat WCW. What we all need to do is move on, there are some good fueds that are coming out. Like Hardy vs Hardy and Orton vs McMahon. So I think we should just move on in to the future.|`|MnKG7VVtaa	I liked the attitude era a lot better. It was way more exciting. They changed it to a PG rating because little kids do watch it and were probably losing viewers because parents thought it was inappropriate.|`|mpIyAn38aa	Attitude era was way better not so E for everyone but NOE for Not Open for Everyone very bloody very exciting                I ALREADY KNOW SOME OF YOU WILL GIVE ME THUMBS DOWN I DON'T CARE THIS IS A QUESTION OF OPINION AND WHAT I PUT UP THERE WAS MY OPINION        See I told you some trolls would give me thumbs down in an opinion question|`|fpMYbn3Jaa	The attitude era was entertaining, they were larger than life characters, and there were more than a few adult like storylines going round (Look it up), the gimmicks, it could be argued were childish in a way, but the way they were used and the way they wrestled were definitely not. This era in WWE has the same constant boring feuds (Edge v Batista probably the worst), nowhere near as many promos due to crap gimmicks and 99% of superstars having crap mic skills, and is just boring due to the absence of some of the bigger characters and better storylines of the attitude era. I mean, HHH is the biggest star now, but was a lackey to the Rock, Stone Cold and Mick Foley in the attitude era. Attitude era = the best.

He has told the Blackhawks that American citizenship is a possibility in the future.      At this point in time, Tyler Myers has already represented Canada at an IIHF sanctioned tournament.  In order to represent the US, he would need to file a petition with the IIHF (and these are usually granted)

Dogs don't digest any of that stuff, yet the above are the main ingredients in most of the common dog-food brands.  Feeding soft food makes it worse; they honest-to-gods grind up euthanised shelter animals for the 'mystery meat' (look up the word "Rendering" as applied to the food industry and you'll see what I mean).  Since the dog's body can't use it and it's got to go somewhere, he passes gas.  No, he can't help it; dogs don't have the same hangups about body functions that humans do.    Looking away: In dog language, a direct stare is a dominance challenge.  When you stare at him, he thinks you're reminding him that you're the boss...so he looks away out of respect.    Sounds like you have a good dog.  Try your library for books on dog care and behavior (636.7 in the Dewey Decimal classification system; not sure about Library of Congress); you'll come to understand all kinds of things, which will be good for both of you.|`|qcE01EMMaa	The dog is sick it wants you that it loves to help it.|`|FG3qT6BWaa	I know people just like you.

DO NOT GET AN EASTERN.   People will say they are good but they are crap, I had one, I snapped the frame by the cranks, the forks bent, the handlebars snapped, the cranks snapped 1st week I got it, wheels were weak I had to straighten them every week. The sprocket just fell apart, yes fell apart, the first day I went downtown street riding.    Also it would be rather smart not to get a low end fit because all their frames are not made out of FULL chromoly. But they do have all sealed bearings so that is good.    Weight is almost no factor on a bike. It is all geometry. If it has a short chain stay (back triangle of the bike) it will spin like mad. But If you have more of a relaxed chain stay (14.25inch+) It is for dirt. You would not be able to spin as good on it.If you can (which I couldn't) go to a bike shop that has some good brands and ride them and feel how they are.    I'll name some good brands.    -Wethepeople  -Stolen  -Verde  -Kink    A good website to shop is Danscomp.com  All you need is something under 28 lbs that you think looks good for you (geometry wise).     ****Warning****  You might want to spend a tad more than 300 or you will regret it.  Because, you WANT FULL chromoly and ALL sealed bearings.    If you have anymore questions e-mail me. With tricks or bikes or anything about bmx.
cKDralDHaa	I think I can effectively answer your question. You see, I've found the main reason people hate John Cena lie within his Gimmick and his moveset. You see in today's current WWE Programming, John Cena is presented as a "Superman" Type of wrestler. Meaning that whatever trouble arises, he will find a way to rise above the odds of defeat and come out the victor. Take for example one of John Cena's biggest obstacles back in Summerslam a year ago. He had to face Bobby Lashley, someone whose physical prowess was actually higher then his, someone whose wrestling ability far outweighed his, and someone whose in-ring drive far succeeded his. Yet, somehow, John Cena managed to come out with a win with his 'patented' *F-U*    That was just one example, the next came the following month when John Cena entered a feud with The Great Khali, while the Punjabi Giant was still a Heel. In the first 2 weeks of the month, John Cena was quite literally knocked the ____ out by Khali, both in the ring, on the ramp and backstage. Yet, for whatever reason when the PPV rolled around, John Cena managed to pull the win out on top of Khali, which was contested since he locked the Giant in the STFU and Khali tapped while his foot was under the rope. They competed the following month in an Anywhere Falls match which John Cena once again won. John Cena then went on to defeat the likes of Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels (3x) Bobby Lashley, The Great Khali & HHH. You see, John Cena "defied the odds' for more then a year.    This in turn presents the same problem the WWE is experiencing with Rey Mysterio. How can someone who everyone knows will find a way to win be considered the "Underdog" or a Superstar who "defies the odds" To be honest, Defying the odds would be someone actually defeating Cena cleanly in a match, which if you haven't noticed rarely ever occurs.    His gimmick aside, the other reason people tend to dislike John Cena is his limited moveset. You see John Cena was a great wrestler in OVW with a plethora of moves under his belt. Yet in the WWE he's presented as someone with the moniker, "5 moves of doom" The 5 moves Cena does to let you know the end of the match those are as follows.    1. Shoulder Block  2. Spinout Powerbomb  3. 5 Knuckle Shuffle  4. F-U  5. STFU    The alternate version of this is    1. Shoulder Block (1x)  2. Shoulder Block (2x)  3. Spinout Powerbomb  4. 5 Knuckle Shuffle  5. F-U    But what these same people fail to realize or have completely overlooked is that this same problem plagues many different Superstars, particularly those in the Main Event circuit. Take for example HHH. Does this look familiar?    1. Opponent goes to closeline HHH who ducks and follows them to the rope with the High Knee.    2. HHH Irish whips the opponent who then counters and bends over and as HHH comes back he hits them with the knee-facebuster    3. Opponent runs at or staggers to HHH who then hits them with the AA Spinebuster    4. Pedigree    Or how about this?    1. Jab  2. Atomic Drop  3. Jab  4. Atomic Drop  5. Hard Scoop Slam  6. Flying Elbow  7. Sweet Chin Music    The moveset is just one of the problems people dislike Cena. Another reason is his current standing with the fans. You see when John first started, he was a nobody, he was the kid who followed the motto "Ruthless Aggression" This then transitioned into a Rapper gimmick, in which Cena would mock, make fun of, beat up backstage and diss his opponents with raps, albeit some weren't as good as the others. It was what the people liked/wanted. They liked the Heel Rapper. Then he made a face turn shortly before making The Marine which became his new gimmick. During which time John Cena was spoon fed to us and pushed way too quickly. It would be the same as me taking something mildly popular and shoving it in your face until you like it. In essence the WWE market was saturated with John Cena. He was pushed TOO FAR. TOO QUICKLY.    People would start liking Cena again first if he made a Heel Turn, but given the Standing with the kid fans this probably won't happen.    John Cena, Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista are all in the same boat with one another. But for w/e reason people just focus on John Cena primarily.   ===========    Most Dangerous DDT? I would say...Gangrel. With the Lifting Spike DDT. Whereas people like Cody Rhodes and HHH just tuck them in the hold and drop back, Gangrel would lift them off the ground up in the air and drop back, almost like a Brainbuster. Hardly anyone's DDT got better then that. Imo Lita had a pretty good one for a while, so did Mickie James but Gangrel is the top of the line in my view.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	I don't not like him, but he's not my favorite. I don't agree that they are ignorant- everyone has an opinion. BQ:Jake Roberts(cant beat the original!)|`|W8SgRKo7aa	Orton has a hell of a lot more moves then Cena. Cena has been working on new moves. If you been watching over the last month or so i have seen Cena do so many more moves i haven't seen from him.        Meanest DDT would be Randy Orton off the ropes. It looks like impact and it just looks mean.|`|ABRPsjwBaa	So let me get this straight,you would love to see a guy hold a title for a bazillion years?Is that it?Guys like Orton,HBK,Y2J,etc. work their @$$ off and they dont get anything in return.While Cena just prance around and gets like a million eterneties of holding a title.What's the deal?Yea,he sure does make a lot of fans buy merchandize,but lets think for a second!Who is more deserving of holding a title,Cena or the rest of the locker room who work their @$$ off more than him?!    Edit-Ok,yea I guess...Well you know what?I'd go watch paint dry,it's far better than that same old crap we get every week.Hey,at least watching paint dry is something you dont see everyday,it's not as repetitve as Cena!Oh and thanks alba for that wonderful idea!|`|s8eDbeF2aa	lita|`|AA11044288	wwe is trying like hell to make cena into the next rock /stone cold  hollywood star that's why hes getting the push not on his in ring work that's why myself and others that you call haters dis like him|`|GJQIL0RZaa	I know.|`|pE7pG9pPaa	Some of the haters, not all. Some bash him with the most ridiculous things such as: "FIVE MOVZ OF DOOM, OHHZ NO". Everyone in WWE has a move-set that they use each match that usually consist of very little moves.    But some actually have legible reasons to hate him.|`|ncHBr8MHaa	I agree with New Heights.  Its not that everyone hates him its just that no one should hold their title for a year people just get tired of that.  Besides his fans no one wants to see him hold that title for very long at all because WWE has made him into this Hulk Hogan-like character who at all times seems to be unstopable.  I personally don't like him so why does it even matter.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Cause Cena is superman. In a tag match, he starts outside. Gets the hot tag then comes in.  Shoulderblock  Shoulderblock  Spin-Out Powerbomb  5 Knuckle Shuffle  FU  Pin    4 moves?|`|Tsv6zyawaa	I dunno, Cena is sooooo boring, i mean come on, watching paint dry is more fascinating than him. He doesn't curse, or diss anymore. So, know, he is officialy useless in WWE.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	John Cena looks like Miss Piggy,.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I don't hate Cena but nobody in this day and age should remain champion for two years. The Hogan Era ended for a reason, people got tired of it.   Here's a thought. Notice how when Cena held the belt forever that TNA grew.|`|TWQNYhVVaa	Only reason I hate Cena is he gets the title every other month and agianst HBK and RKO he's nothing,but compared to some he ain't that bad..    WQ:Randy Orton,the one where the guy's legs are on the middle rope|`|7ACBEowxaa	sad that they still put the title on his waist when he is not a great wrestler, and his character is becoming dull and boring, just like what happended with hogan, he has been good for so long, and fans got sick of it, so it was time for a change and hogan turned to be biggest heel of all time,  looks like it will happen to cena sooner or later as well.|`|ycaloVnkaa	Does any1 really even care about thoroughly discussing sumting as fake as WWE? Who cares if john cena gets more title shots or w/e in the end its all a setup.

7cm7pmAtaa	In general there are two basic and accepted tests of proving the sharpness of a blade:  1 cuts (CUTS) through paper being held in one hand with no dificulty  2 shaves hair off of the arm or similar body part.  3 if you really want to know RW cutting ability look for a video of tatami cutting with said dagger (not likely to find but swords and knives you will especially katana's)|`|cILeS32iaa	Have you actually seen that happen or have you read that somewhere?

jTFdG8xqaa	Mirror lenses are super popular right now. Everybody is making them and they aren't hard to find. If your looking for a complete refelction you will most likely want a silver mirror, though many lenses now have a partial mirror on their outer lens to help handle glare. I like SPY as well as Oakley. Scott makes a pretty cool pair in reasonable price range as does smith. Dragons are cool looking if a little lacking for thier price. I mainly use a pair of oakleys (standard permision "orange" lenses) and a pair of SPY's silver mirror bronze underneath. I have never owned a pair of goggles as clear as my spy's and i absolutely love them but with oakley or spy you are paying for the name. Good luck you won't have trouble at all finding mirrored lenses...no polarized goggles do not necessarily have a mirror.     As for where to buy i would say buy them local or at http://www.the-house.com     A friend of mine introduced me to this website and they have great prices on winter gear.|`|LIKkt8djaa	Yeah the pic doesn't work but you're looking for Mirrored lenses, Most of them should have somewhere in the description stating the type of lense, similar ones to being nearly mirrored would be Ionized lenses.

D1beU6MPaa	Matz has trained him on turf, dirt, and poly track. He is currently at odds of 4/1 and ranked 8/38. Pretty darn good. I hope he wins, but I am looking for him to do well in this race. Poor thing, it's a good thing he doesn't know who's footsteps he is walking in. Go get em boy!  Source(s):  Horse owner and breeder  Avid horse racing enthusiast    WEll it seems that he injured himself at the starting gate. He grabbed a quarter, but they are saying it is nothing serious. Let's hope he mends quickly and goes on to the next race.|`|YzlKVq4naa	Yes, I was so nervous for him as well and as soon as the field hit the final turn I knew it just wasn't his day;  BUT, he has a reason(:    Leaving the gate, it was seen Nicanor had stumbled and did not recover fully.    Read the full story here.  http://racing.bloodhorse.com/article/490...

Did you notice the  morning line put him at 4-1, so that alone says that he is  expected to do well.  I bet he will be in the money.|`|RyZHhI6aaa	This is the most anticipated unraced horse since The Green Monkey.    I sincerely hope that he does well.  I don't expect him to win the Derby or anything, but I hope he's good enough to run in at least some minor stakes races.  I don't know anything about the horses he's running against, so I really can't say how well he's gonna do.  I personally think his workout times are a bit slow, but maybe he'll perk up in a race.  The Matz team says that he's learning and improving greatly and if Michael says that Nicanor is ready, then I trust that he is.    I think he's given low morning line odds because people are gonna bet on this horse for who he is... the odds-maker is supposed to set the odds based on what the public is likely to do... with the Donn and the Holy Bull just before Nicanor's debut, there should be a lot of triple crown fans at the track, not just the normal handicappers.  The fans are more likely to bet based on name rather than the program figures.    Good Luck Nicanor, we'll be watching.          Too bad.  I would have liked to see him finish better than 10th.  It looked to me like he sort of lost his nerve around the last turn when he was 3 wide and there were about 6 horses surrounding him on all sides.  And I hope he breaks better next time out so he doesn't have to make up ground during the first quarter.
EBSSJba0aa	A.  There is no way that the current era could ever (or will ever) compare with the attitude era. The attitude era created the WWF/WWE and had the top stars and the best legends. There's no way that guys like Cena could compare to The Rock. Batista can't compare to Stone Cold Steve Austin. Even this current Triple H sucks compared to the Triple H of the  attitude era. Don't get me wrong, I have to give credit to guys like Randy Orton, Cena and Batista but, the WWE just won't be the same again :(|`|bBHlGs5waa	A|`|5rXJrM0Uaa	A|`|D8a0X3oAaa	Type A.

75ZMWlnnaa	i know what u mean.    i for one respect rafa alot because of his superb mental toughness, he just does not give up, have to admire him alot for that.     i always cheer for roger over rafa but that does not mean i am blind to how great rafa is as well. i have tremendous respect for BOTH of them as athletes and professional tennis players.    personally, i find it really childish when people start arguing over roger and rafa, i mean roger and rafa have alot of mutual respect for each other, i do not understand why the respective groups of fans for each player can not follow that same example displayed by the players themselves...    rafa and roger have done so much for the sport in the last 4 years or so, and they are still dominating the sport, holding the top 2 spots since july 2005, incredible!!! (forget djokovic and murray...they have a VERY LONG way to go before they even get to the level of BOTH roger and rafa).    yes, i agree that playing against rafa is like playing against a brick wall, u need to have a very good day playing your butt off or hope that rafa is not in the zone when u play against him.    i used to find the butt picking real annoying, but im used to seeing him do that now, although i do admit that it is not the most pleasant sight to see.    lets hope that it will be a "thriller" match tomorrow night, i for one just can not wait. =)|`|Wg3UySpfaa	lol, funny observation...i observed it too. i think for those who like and cheer for nadal wouldn't find it annoying that he returns every ball, it just makes them all the more excited but i see your point and i agree. You're definitely right he plays on patience and plays every point like it's his last. Every player should do that and i respect that about him.     when i comes to the whole pick on the pants, i have made a conclusion that as irritating as that is and as much as i'd like him to stop i think that it's just become a pattern for him, a routine for each time that he gets ready to serve and return. He puts his hair behind his ears and then picks his pants before every point, i bet half of th time he doesn't even need to pick his pants but he just does it anyway because he's so use to it. So i think it's an unconscious routine that he does which i think he isn't even aware of half of the time.|`|iS4oVr7caa	No|`|SWxnbKyyaa	Annoying for some die-hard Fedex fans    Edit: I know that mate, I was just joking, I just copied it for fun,hope you haven't taken it  seriously.No offense mate.Anyway I will change it for you    Nadal doesnt have an attractive style of play but he impressed me with his hard work    Edit:But, I dont know what to change!!!!!|`|QHi5TU0Paa	yeah i kinder agree. Nadal is a great play in this day and age. But i was so wanting Verdasco to win. Im sick of the same finals all the time. Its like watching the williams sisters all the time. You get sick and tired of it. Verdasco played so good i just thought he should have won.|`|mhgMQBo6aa	I think that Verdasco played a phenomenal match.  His winners vs. unforced errors was amazing and his serving percentages were very good as well.  His volleys were very well spotted and he was quick on his feet.     All of these things added up to a very exciting 5 setter, but Nadal did win...and yes he does seem like a wall and gets almost everything back...but keep in mind this isnt his surface..clay is...so i dont think that this match was a good representation of how Nadal plays overall.    Btw i did want verdasco to win...im not a huge fan of either federer or nadal so im not trying to say that nadal is better than fed and im not saying the likewise either lol|`|hd7J2aoNaa	no  i love him  [Pro-Sarcasm?]|`|HlFCd3yvaa	Seems like youre getting too much of Rafa but i agree with you that he's a "bugger"....im glad he didnt chase the balls the ballboys were holding coz that would mean trouble...har,har,har,....|`|VJLkpPBPaa	Firstly yes i wish Verdasco won!!!! totally devastated he didn't....      But Rafael is not soo annoying... yes besides his picking at his pants.... i find him adorable and a gentle man of the game, very kind and polite on court and off the court. I think that he's a great player and sportsman of the game. ... but i don't know why he wears dimonties on his pants ??    ps the most amazing match of tennis have seen!|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Mate he is so good thats whats the annoying thing about him..And the fact that he picks wedgies out of his butt everytine he is getting ready to serve..    Last night was one of the best matches i have ever seen,in the end i did not care who won because they were both so awesome..  He is one tough cookie and if he plays like that tomorrow night then he is looking at grabbing the win against Fedex..    May the best man win..    ATM i am sitting and i have just witnessed one of Serena's easiest Grand Slam wins in her life(and she is now number 1 too)..|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|rG0TXDGeaa	you have a point. Playing Nadal is like playing a wall. A wall always wins eventually no matter what you do.|`|onkUcy19aa	I agree with you. Nadal is really unreal and annoying at the same time. While I was rooting for Nadal, I was really taken by Verdasto's doggedness and persistence. Yet, Nadal prevailed in the end with those "brute power and topspin." Yeah, man. Nadal has "really fast wheels to chase down everything."    Your observations are correct. Good luck to you.

YsSwe1Laaa	Clever is a big man (2 m; 98 kg) with very good speed and superior upper-body strength.  He has the aggressiveness that one would expect from a American.  Having played previously at North Harbour and now in RSA (and 25 caps), I think it is fair to say he has a reputation at the level of international professional rugby as a serious flanker.  He is captain of the USA team - whatever that says about his rugby ability (and I'm sure we have some serious rugby snobs here who woudl say: not much), it says a good deal about him as a man and a leader.    Is he one of the half-dozen foremost open-side flankers in the game?  No.  He didn't grow up with rugby as a top-ranked sport, and he did not get superior coaching and the opportunity to compete day-in and day-out against top talent.  No one in the US gets those chances until they find a way to play overseas.  That's just the way it is.      To his credit, and the benefit of his long-term future, part of the lack of top-level competition is because he elected to attend and graduate from a serious university.  This involved commitments of time and effort to his studies and limitations on his rugbny training from the US controls for university athtletics.    I'd say the odds are very high that he would seriously whip anyone slagging him on this board if they chose to run on opposite him in a ruby match.  He can come play for my club anytime he wants to when he's done playing professionally.    Mark L.|`|0IuWhmWUaa	I would say that hes a school kid compared to Dan Carter or Matt Giteau.|`|GQpTI2GWaa	No, not world class at all.     No USA players fit the world class bracket. Not even Z Ngwenya.|`|gz2M5hsBaa	He's not a world class player. I've seen him play and I think he's good enough to be playing professionally in the major rugby countries though.    The Lions have signed him, so it seems that the Super 14 teams are interested in him. The Lions are absolute rubbish so i'm sure he'll stand out there.|`|AA11678048	He'll stick out a little. The Lions might be crap but they'll be a class above him. I don't really rate him to be honest. Big fish in a small pond.
onkUcy19aa	Nadal is one awesome guy! Did you see his fight with Francisco Verdasto where he eventually won in the last set? It was a classic, and while Verdasto was great, Nadal was greater, because he won. That was one of the best tennis fights I had seen. Yes, I agree with you. He is definitely a sexy guy.|`|WXjvWLNraa	3 words, I hate Nadal.|`|uh5Ngtmnaa	yes i do, i'am very happy for watching his play. he also has the sexy body and a nice smile.

They're obviously the most overspending team though, which certainly has had something to do with it. To their credit though, in between '96-00', they did it with pitching and many of their own players they brought up. Like Jeter, Pettite, Rivera, Posada, Bernie and so on. But recently, they certainly have been well overrated. The Rays are everything but overrated though. It was shocking for them just to get there. It seemed like everyone was rooting for them, but it's not fair to call them overrated. Mayber overachievers if they can't get back to the postseason, but that's another thing. Trust me, going back to the Yankees, they won't be winning any World Series soon. Honestly, the most overrated teams in recent times would include the Cubs and Angels. They get it done during the regular season, but can't get it done during the season. In many ways, my Mets have been in the last couple seasons. They should have been able to get it done. I really think the Phillies were a one time wonder, and right now they appear to be overrated, but over their entire history, they haven't been overrated. Outside of 1980, up to this point, they were barely ever recognized.|`|aiCsZzIsaa	Yankees and Tigers|`|DnFoaKPqaa	Angels already predicted to win the West? I would definitely have to choose these guys considering the caliber of personnel they are losing and what the Athletics have already gotten. This team will definitely come no where near 100 wins this season.|`|GyJqMWdUaa	Rays and Yankees.      The Rays had a good season, but I don't think they'll come anywhere close to repeating their success this year.    The Yankees are always highly overrated.  Sabathia is average against the AL, and only pitched well against the weaker NL.  Teixeira will put up some numbers, and Burnett is average as well.  Jeter is the most overrated player in the game right now.  Cano is worthless... Melky, Swisher and Nady are too.  A-Rod is a good player only until October 1st.   I like Posada, Matsui, and Rivera though, but their team is only a little above average with all that money spent.  Damon is a toss up.  He'll have a good month or two but the rest of the time he's just an average player too.|`|AYiVipawaa	yanks: haven't won a world series since '99, and just cuz they got cc and burnett, you have to remember that their pitching used to suck, so now it's pretty good. and now that they got teix, they used to only have giambi and arod as hr hitters, and giambi's gone. and besides, once you think about it, teix doesn't hit too many hr. he hit 33 last year.|`|3QELIOU7aa	Yankees.|`|uHmLkqmRaa	Obvious !!

8A0JdS7Xaa	That's what it's supposed to do. With an empty magazine, the follower pushes the bolt catch up and locks the bolt to the rear. Whenever you retract the bolt on an empty mag you will have to manually push the charging handle forward and lock it.|`|mQtbmvZXaa	Your rifle is badly damaged!

Scenario...  ~AR-15 is fired until magazine is empty...  ~The Bolt/Bolt-Carrier is locked to the rear when the magazine follower in the magazine pushes upwards after the last cartridge is fired...  ~ The empty magazine is removed and a loaded magazine is inserted fully...  ~The shooter presses the bolt-release button and the bolt/bolt-carrier assembly is released (and during the process a cartridge is loaded into the chamber)  ~With the safety off, the rifle is ready to shoot.    As far as your "how do i fix the problem?" question goes, I suggest reading the Owners Manual.  If you don't have one, then they're available here...  http://www.ar15.com/content/index.html m...

MAlPvWhEaa	Its very important to have a solid neutral position. If you're high, your legs are completely open, and more importantly, you are not in a good position to react and sprawl. When you are in an athletic position, you're quicker. When you're standing up, you're slow. Maintain your athletic position at all times, no matter how tired you are.    If you know that you aren't going for takedowns, then why don't you go for takedowns? It is important to be aggressive. If you don't shoot, you aren't even giving yourself a chance. Work on some set ups, and practice that penetration step every chance you get. If you don't have a good shot, ask your coach about bad-shot offense. You can get sprawled on and still get that take down, you just need to know what you're doing.    Remember on bottom to always base up when you are broken down. Fight for wrist control, because if you are able to get the wrists, you are home free. If you face a leg rider, kick your legs back and free yourself before you try anything.    Wrestling is not an easy thing to do. It takes time; I started this year being thrown into varsity matches and getting pinned in the first period. I went through a losing streak of 13 matches before I started to win. The important thing is to get better with each match.|`|vDky5V15aa	First you need to forget everything you think you learned by watching the UFC. The UFC doesn't have display true wresting skills.     There are some good books and DVD's produced by Dan Gable. He is a legend in amateur wrestling and his techniques will help you tremendously.     Also, if you can afford it, go to some summer wrestling camps and get involved in AAU or your local wresting teams outside of school. They can help you and you will get valuable mat experience.       If you can't afford a good camp, just go sit in on some of the high school practices. Get in good with the coach and see what he suggests. Start with the basics and work hard and you will be fine.     As far as conditioning goes, either hit the weights and bulk up to 115 or do a lot of cardio and slim down a little. You are too young for the dehydration crap that we all did in school so I would suggest bulking up a bit.     Good luck and I hope these resources help.|`|ewlVffW1aa	i no this guy last name is aviril or averel or summin but he started in 8th grade lost every match and by the time he finished high school he was a state champion and placed for state two or three times      in collage he was an alternate for the olympics in his weight class    he later joined the military and was undefeated in boxing while in there      u just gatta hang in there for the part ways      also u should try to do dynamic wrestling or journeymen or whatever prograam they got    and weightlift       and look up wrestling things on youtube      u sound like maybe[just maybe] ud be better off going down a weight class    understand when u do submission itll be a whole new game    keep a lower stance and at least feint for a takedown to open him up then u might wanna go for one      learn to meditate and do it on ur wrestling like picture urself doing moves u no but with great mastery and anticipate in ur mind any move they may do|`|fRosDAZEaa	Lose any sense of hesitation when it comes to attacking.  Walk onto the mat knowing that you are going to take 30 shots without event giving your opponent a chance to squeeze one in.  Have it made up in your mind that you are going to be the most relentless SOB your opponent has ever faced.

I would try and get a carpool worked out- if someone lives close to you maybe you could catch a ride with them.    Drylands: you aren't swimming that day, but I'll give you our drylands that we do before we swim.  Running: about 5 miles, if you don't run much then 1 or 2- then work your way up. Don't stop when you get out of breath- stop when you pass out! XD We're swimmers, breathing is for chumps anyway :D    there's also other leg stuff, like lunges (try doing a mile in lungs, that'll get you excersided, it'll also make you feel really silly. You get strange looks doing that- expesially if half of that is done backwards O_o)  or streamline jumps, frog jumps  (arms in streamline- jump up and down. little jumps  frog jumps: get in a squating position, your butt should be as close to the ground as you can get withought sitting.   Hands touching the ground, jump up in streamline- go back down in original position.  Try 10 at a time, for maybe a total of 50.)    Pushups: if you want to get them done fast, diamond pushups!  Make sure your hands are directly below your shoulders- not closer or farther apart.  On your feel not your knees, and either look straight down or infront of you.  Diamond: hands together. index finger to index finger, thumb to thumb. i think it looks like a heart....   but it's freakin hard!  pushups: 10 at a time, for a total of maybe 50 again.  diamond: uh... 4 at a time. Total of 20, or less if you can't.)    bikes and double bikes:  sit on your bootie!  arms crossed (like a mummy) or behind your head.  If you can't balance like that put your arms out like you're an airplane!    single bikes would mean one let at a time, one leg streaches out while the other is tucked at your chest.  then switch, keep going in a motion like you're ridding a bike.  keep your feet about a foot (a bit less then) off the ground  do  that without dropping for a full minute.    double bikes: same thing, only your feet are synced- both move at the same time: in at your chest and streached out.    Crunches: get in sit up position, hands on your chest (like a mummy) or behind your head *but do not pull with your hands or neck!*   look directly up at. not forwards!  lean upward, use your abbs- not your neck or your head or you arms.  make sure to get your shoulder blades off the ground.    sit ups, you should know these XD again, don't use your arms to pull up do: hmm... about 100, more if you can  side situps: lay like in a normal situp.  put your knees to the ground on one side of you- keep your back on the ground.  Look straight up, and do like you did in the crunches  switch sides, do 25 of each 4 times through.    straigh legged situps: like the name says      pikes: you sould do about 20 of these  lay down flat on your back, legs straight out.  arms above your head- straight as well.  lift your arms and leggs up, they will meet in the middle (you will have to use your abbs a lot for this)  when you come back down, do not let your feet touch the ground!!!!  keep them about a foot from the floor- then go back up and touch your fingers to you toes.  That's one :D      planks: these hurt the bone in my arm- but I have to do them on tile. It imght not hurt on carpet so much O_O;    get in kinda like a push up state. only your arms will be on the floor. lace your hands together.  your forarm will be on the floor, and bent- so your shoulders have a slight verdical line to your elbow.    Raise yourself up on your toes, and hold. It'll hurt. a lot...  but try and stay up for a full minute      I think that's probably enough to list for now- so I'll leave you with that   ^-^    hope it was helpfull|`|eYdfG3Tmaa	Ask your coach for workouts  as for running   a good way to do it is  run a mile  do some exercises  run a mile   do some exercises    or something like that alternating running and exercises  do this all the time at my practices

BEst of luck(Y)|`|98BKRICvaa	well wut always works for me is think am i really doing my best???    and,      wut would this be like if i acually started trying    i know wut its like we lost to the same team its hard!!!|`|edTXS7tQaa	To me they sound way over confident and if you get to a good start and give them a bad start then they will go down hill from there and you will go up hill from there. So the best thing to do is pump up your team and say we can do this instead of they suck. Get a good night sleep a good meal a few hours before and stay hydrated. Tell your team mates these tips as well and this will help you a lot. So go pumped and play your hearts out! I wish the best of luck to you! I have one a championship and runner-up before. Winning it all is a lot better! GOOD LUCK!
fwkxK2cCaa	It all depends on how strong of a tug it is.  The reason being is because the stronger the tug the bigger the fish and normally, big catfish tends to gulp their bait in one bite as opposed to smaller ones that will sit there and nip at the bait because their mouth are much smaller.  If your line have tension on it for more than a few seconds and if I was you I would set the hook right away before it spits it back out.  Most anglers would probably set the hook right away with other species of fish but with catfish, you can let a second or two go by before you set the hook.      **You mentioned the depth of the pond which may not be relevent at all.  Shallow or deep, catfish all bite the same.    ***My bad...I reread your question again and understand now what you were trying to ask.  So, you want to know how long you should leave it down there before reeling it back in?    Okay, since you're using bread as bait and with a little bit of honey added to make it more enticing, I wouldn't leave it in there no more than 10 minutes.  The reason being because there are also smaller fishes in there as you mentioned and they will sit there and peck at it little by little until there's nothing left but the bare hook.  If a big cat comes by, you'll know.|`|K1Bnbf4maa	not very long. i mean, ive never done it but bread disolves very fast when wet so probably not long at all. you will be lucky if it even stays on the hook once you cast it and its sinking to the bottom! dont use bread to fish with, try worms, crawfish, liver, hot dogs, shad or sumthin! not bread?|`|q8dX0MsNaa	it sounds to me like your pond is WAAY too crowded with stunted ADULT sunfish and cats. this happens when they are allowed to breed uncontrolled by larger prey species. that's a small pond to support any more than a few fish. you need to seine them out and release them into a river or stream that will support them. they are starving in your pond. reduce the population by 99% and put a couple largemouth bass to help control them. if you are living in a state that allows it, you could sell your sunfish for bait. they sound like a perfect catfish size.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	1.) If i throw a line in the middle of a 15 foot deep pond, about 30 feet across with bread & honey on the hook, how long can i leave it if a fish hits it?    Wait at least 5-10 minutes. Catfish roam the bottom searching for food, and if it looks tasty to them, they just scoop it up. I disagree w/ others and say this will catch catfish, channel catfish at least. If carp are in the pond they would love that also, i may make a new carp recipe w/ honey and bread next time.  If you need any more questions, just send me an email and I'll be glad to help you out.|`|lECmz3SEaa	I dont think the cat will go for that , but if they do it should be 5 minutes at the most if they are in a feeding frenzy.

xbuZFjveaa	You are obviously new so I will try not to confuse you with "pool" language...I will assume you are right handed. If you are left handed, simply reverse everything. Basically, you will hold the back of the pool cue (the 'stick') with your right hand (loose grip-don't hold it tightly) about ten inches from the end, and create a 'bridge' with your left hand to guide the thinner, 'shaft' end of the cue toward the the ball that you are shooting at. The easiest bridge to form is an open one-simply press the knuckle of your thumb against your first finger. That will form a 'V' shape to keep the cue in line while shooting. Set your left hand on the table about eight inches from the white ball and visually line up your shot. Take a few practice strokes before actually hitting the ball, and don't jerk the cue or try to hit theball hard. A medium speed. even, controlled stroke is what works best. For beginners, focus on striking the white ball in dead center. And another tip; don't stand sideways...square your hips to your shot as much as possible. Your right leg will naturally set behind you left a little, and thats fine.  Well, theres a starting point. all thats left now is for you to practice, practice, practice; and adjust your stance as to what is comfortable.|`|qXlBsRLgaa	i dont get the question??

Right now I don't think there is any reason for him wanting to take a break because he is the world champion and the biggest face in the WWE right now it is every wrestlers dream. Vince won't want him to take a break because Cena easily draws the best ratings for the company which has McMahon make more money. As long as Cena continues to draw good ratings I don't see any reason why Vince will want him to take a break.

He will probably tell Legacy that he got this on his own..     Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy.. Jeff's probably going to win.. even though i wouldn't mind seeing Matt win    John Cena vs HBK vs JBL vs Rey Mysterio vs Kofi Kingston vs Kane..  HBK will probably win.. last two again will probably be JBL and HBK and HBK betrays him     and if your wondering why Kanes in the EC, well maybe give him a 2nd chance.. Kane is The Elimination Chamber.. They need a big guy..    Edge vs Triple H vs Big Show vs Undertaker vs MVP vs R-Truth   I think Edge will retain.. (Christian return is highly to happen after the match) but this will be the match of the night..
iO12Vjnvaa	If I am not mistaken he has signed on with Prism motorsports to drive a few races in 09 (Terry Labonte will drive in the 500). The car   will be 66 and they will campaign Toyotas.    Just an opinion as always.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Terry Labonte will drive the car in the Daytona 500 and he will take over after that. It will be the  66.|`|iT8CNh6paa	He is going to share the  66 Window World car with Terry Labonte|`|XAhFBgIfaa	http://www.jayski.com/schemes/2009/66cup... number is 66|`|3f5eb6adc2988f8d8a7b40fe71ea20feaa	He will drive the 66 Window World Toyota after Terry Labonte drives the car in the Daytona 500|`|V1O7N02saa	Dave is going to be in the  66 I believe from Prism Motorsports which I believe was MSRP Motorsports up until a while ago. One of their owners is NASCAR SPEED Analyst Phil Parsons.  The plan is Terry Labonte will be in the car for the 500 & Dave will take over for the remainder of the season.    For a while it looked like Terry Cook from the Camping World Truck Series was going to be in this ride.

tdG6NkEJaa	Whatever someone wants to pay for it.  Would be worth more if it was a 2000 jersey IMO as that was the most impressive season by an AFL team ever. Wherever you sell it make sure you say from 2000 :)|`|mXFOru11aa	i wouldn't buy it but someone would be willing to pay 50 bucks for it frame it and it could raise to 55 bucks|`|RqM1TZXyaa	Well, it depends who's signatures they are.  Like, if it was James Hird, Matthew Lloyd, Scott Lucas, Dustin Fletcher and some other big names then it would be worth alot more than if it were less well known players.  But a few years ago i brought a essendon Guernsey signed by james hird for $290.  So, i would say that it would be worth between $400 and $500.|`|94d210326a19c672cd98b1a32e43da78aa	2000 isn't all that old. If it is framed and is clean then that adds a lot of value. More important is whether it is verified as having authentic signatures or not. If it is not verified and is just loose then I would say about $90. If it is framed and verified then maybe $250.    But of course you need to find a person prepared to part with hard currency for it....|`|2s244jGgaa	Call: 1300 72 50 45  By ringing this number, you can ask the value of your essendon signed guernsey. This number is an AFL memorbilia contact number so they should tell you how much it is worth.    Personally, because the guernsey itself is SO OLD and has premiership players signitures, it would be worth around 5 or 6 hundred.|`|Wa2fpDLFaa	that would go for about $400-$500|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	You might get lucky and find Essendon fan who would pay but prob only $500 would be worth heaps if it was 2000 jumper signed after the grand final and verified yours is a mix match old jumpers with new names not worth money but a great collectable for you frame it and hang it on a wall.|`|BFyqa3neaa	What, we're all meant to be Nostradamus here?    Put it on & find out for yourself.
dpSr0icwaa	that is an old gun    problem is, Iver Johnson was a low cost gun company that made a TON of guns, so it isn't a particularly rare, desireable, or famous gun.    value is greatly dependant on the condition of the gun, but this has no real collectors value beyond being chambered in a 38 rimfire.  I'd say $300 for an average condition specimine|`|rP1OWD38aa	I would suggest asking that question here if you can't find the information.
XZpk5KuJaa	yes, but it is pretty expensive|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Absolutely.  As far expense goes, it's no more expensive than any other product.|`|Ve1HMtoHaa	Yeah, you can get a nice Nike Ignite iron set 3hybrid-sw for about $399.99.    At the same time, you can get the Callaway Big Bertha's for $399.99; also the TaylorMade r7s.    If you have big money to spend, get the NIKE VICTORY RED IRONS that Tiger and Anthony Kim use    I've only been playing for about 7 months, but I bought some Adams Tight Lies irons for my first set.|`|jJ5h7zgjaa	YES, i have everything nike and it rules.  The only thing is, it cost enough that you can play a few rounds of golf for the price of everything.|`|MR4WwKoZaa	It's good, but as someone said, the new ones are expensive.  Wait until they are put on sale before buying them.|`|NU06LUUXaa	Yes but other things are less costly and just as good.     Ping  Taylor Made  Titleist  Mizuno    Most Nike bits are rip offs of Titleist and Mizuno. Why? because Tiger Woods prefers those two, and tells Nike what he likes and does not like.|`|PQfZHbeYaa	tiger wood uses it, what do u think ? but also they pay tiger wood millions of dollars to use it so u will be sponsoring his wages indirectly. I prefer company that has low profile n do not sponsor superstar (eg: maxfli). :)
LIKkt8djaa	The size of the board will depend on the type of riding you're looking to get into    Freeride: longer in length, and semi-directional. Moderate to stiff in flex. Used for long, fast turns in various types of snow from groomed hard-pack to soft powder.    Freestyle: Generally shorter in length with a Semi-directional or twin-tip shape. Moderate to soft in flex. Incorporates a deep sidecut for quick/tight turning. Used in the pipe and in the park on various jumps and terrain features including boxes, rails, and tables.    All-Mountain: A hybrid between freeride and freestyle boards. The 'jack of all trades, master of none.' Normally directional in shape with either a twin or directional flex. Moderate in flex for various types of terrain.    I would look in these size ranges for you    All-mountain - 148-151  Freestyle - 144-148  Freeride - 153-156        As for picking boots I highly suggest not buying boots online without at least first having tried them on. Theirs a good chance the boot may not fit your feet properly and have bad pressure points. Something I suggest doing is trying on a bunch of different brands with your boarding socks on, make sure you walk around and even do some hops in them. You want to make sure they fit very snug, your toes should just be touching the end of the boot but shouldn't be crunched.     Also another thing most new people don't know is that when picking a snowboarding boot size you typically downsize one full size from your normal shoe size. You do this because one as I listed above the boot needs to fit snug and also with time and use the boot will actually pack out, so if you buy a new boot that is already loose it will only become looser with time and use, negating control over the board.    You shouldn't have to worry about toe drag just the binding size to match your boots, Most high end bindings can fit two sizes such as S/M and L/XL, You'd be in the S/M category and if by chance it can only fit one size then Medium.|`|vsWUHwAyaa	i googled and found this, thought it was pretty complete and filled in a few of the gaps that the other answers missed.|`|Unaaay0Caa	I'm actually the same exact size as you and my first board ever was the roxy sugar. thats kinda weird haha but yes i totally recommend that as your first board, it was very easy to control & a good board to learn on. When i had my roxy board i had a 144. Now i ride with  a burton park board and its a 146. most of the time a board comes somewhere around your chin & nose. Since your a beginner i doubt you'll be needing a park board. a park board you usually want to get shorter(it makes it easier to control) for just free-riding down the mountain you can get away with something a little longer. this website actually says you can be anywhere from a 140-148 http://www.the-house.com/site/info/info-... (and yes any of these sizes will fit your shoe size)    one last recommendation i have is if you dont want the roxy board burton offers a well priced(retail is $299 but you can get it cheaper) beginner board called the burton feather. heres a link to it(personally i like burton boards a lot better, i just like the feel & control to them)http://www.sandownactivesports.com/shop.... this board comes in a few sizes i'd suggest either the 144 or the 149 its mostly your choice, i prefer the smaller....hope this helps =)

z6ZvhSkQaa	its true in some sports (like weight lifting and gymastics) that if started at an allete level younge (like ages 10-13) then it can stop both boys and girls from going through puberty. that is why there is an age limit for gymastic of 16. its to protect this from happening. other sports like running and swimming to have an age limit because it actaully benafits you to be young and if you are "that" good then why not?|`|fCKFqXN8aa	Well it does slow growth, like hormones are slow going.

Nothing more.    It would be the same as saying basketball playing makes you tall.    Gymnastics attracts shorter athletes because having a lower center of gravity is of benefit to you in the sport.    And taller athletes would gravitate toward basketball because they would be closer to the basket.    Make sense?  It's not the sport that dictates the height, but the height that dictates the sport.|`|mj3LBE3laa	yeah probly but short people are cool|`|Aj16de8Aaa	I hope not. I am really short and I have been doing gymnasstics for 7 years but my two friends here have been doing it just as lond and they are normal. Maybe even tall. so I don't know. Its just that most gymnasts that are really good are short. on bars it looks better if you are short beacause it makes it look faster and better... =)
j29eHSDqaa	Only one thing.... THE COACH.!!!!            -----------------------------------|`|2wrenQfuaa	It's Iverson, lack of a true PG who can lead, and Curry who can't even come up with a starting 5.    Fire Curry!!!|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I hear you and Its Management been letting the Team down they we're fine last year with Billups and Flip as coach, now they want to get rid of Rip Hamilton now they will get worse because they'll get another player like AI who will let the Team down.|`|GBGcI509aa	No Billups.|`|i0Igqvroaa	its cuz they have the wrong lineup    the starting lineup for the whole season should be    C Rasheed Wallace  PF Antonio McDyess  SF Tay Prince  SG Richard Hamilton  PG Allen Iverson    Bench:  Rodney Stuckey (20-25 minutes a game)  Maxiell  the rest of the guys|`|dDhTMacAaa	THey played hard, and amazing Defense.

The reason it has been such a failure, 1. A.I. isnt being well he is actually being kept from doing what they wanted him to do which is score! and be at a fast pace. 2. A.I. isnt getting barely enough playing time 3. Michael Curry is retarded for slowing down Iverson's game. If you notice when the Pistons have good wins AI is scoring good points when they lose iverson has like 11 points. And alot of it is RIP Hamilton who is taking up all the time. Michael Curry doesnt understand a thing, about the game. So another thing is, is getting rid of Flip Saunders  Edit: Iverson is not letting the pistons down, they recently did an article on how good he is in the locker room and how he has positive energy and working to help the team out and they are appreciating it. The Pistons are letting  AI down|`|nG0z3hgsaa	No Mr Big Shot!!|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	AI is a team killer talented player has lots of heart but he doesnt know how to play with other talented players.|`|Is7WnDKAaa	getting AI means they want to have cap space for the future.  and theyre not going anywhere with that line up.|`|uRvB9fDhaa	they need flip saunders back and trade a.i even though he is one of my alltime favs. trade for a pg,sg,or c they also need bench help
CBVlu3Gvaa	Leaders in the Driver market have been Taylormade, Nike, Callaway and Titleist.  Those would be the first ones I'd look at but there are several others out there as well.  Picking a Driver is as personal as choosing a swimming suit......so go with what you like and what does what you want it to.  Hit them all.|`|7mhqRhJKaa	The best driver on the market today is undoubtedly THE ONE that fits YOU best.  The flex and length of the shaft and the size of the grip are very important.  Also place each driver behind a ball, and make sure you like how it looks at address.  Either go to a Custom Clubmaker, a Golf shop, or Professional who can measure your swing speed and physical measurements, including your grip size, and then fit you properly.    The driver is the longest club in your bag and it is important to make sure it FITS YOU.|`|NU06LUUXaa	Hi there,    Well there is an arguement for everything, but I do believe that the highest rated Driver on the market currently, is the Nike Sumo.    I would suggest a good talk with your local pro shop and your bank balance before your new purchase.    Enjoy.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	the best on the market may not be for you. get what resembles what you've been using. which drivers i like cobra and wilson. i use wilson .|`|wxGEYbZfaa	Taylor Made Burner Tour and Titleist 909DComp, probably the two best out there.  Also, very expensive.|`|NCBDNMLXaa	The simple fact is that the "best" driver is the one that works best for you.    When I was looking for a new driver I came in here asked a similar question...got lots of recommendations.  Then I went to a good golf shop where they have knowledgable people and a good simulator to try out those recommendations.  The salesperson took the time to listen to me and he asked some questions before we grabbed the Yahoo Answers recommended clubs and headed into the simulator.    After watching me swing and observing the feedback provided by the simulator, he made a few recommendations of his own.  And in the end, the club he recommended was putting me in the middle of the fairway with greater consistency than any of the other clubs I tried, and it was 10-15 yards longer on average...my best hits with this club were 20+ longer than my best with any of the others.    So, the moral of the story is to:    1.  Get some recommendations in here  2.  Go to a reputable golf shop with good people and a good simulator  3.  Work with the salesperson and keep an OPEN MIND!!!    Remember, none of us here know how tall you are, how fit you are, how strong you are, and most importantly none of us have ever seen you swing, so all we can do is tell you what clubs we like or have been told by others are the "best".  But in the end, "best" is really a function of what works for YOU, not what works for any of us.    And in case you're wondering, I ended up with a Ping G10 with the high launch shaft.  After trying all the alternatives, this was my "best" club.    Go find your "best"...you'll be happy you did!!
s3yP7IoOaa	You should run your intervals at an 80% pace, then ''baby jog'' around the track. Keep doing this until your absolutely sure you can't run another, then try and do one more. This will make you awesome for 800s. It builds endurance and speed.     P.S. Running one more after you don't think you can, even if its a lot slower, makes you feel great about yourself. =)|`|AA10241450	The best way to run your intervals is at your race pace however you can also mix up the speeds with shorter intervals for instance 200 meter intervals use your 400 meter race pace.    For recovery time it's best to use 120 heart beats per minute - your find that the first running interval your have less recovery time whereas your 8th interval your heart will probably need more time to recover.  The interval purpose is to run at your race speed and as you train more your find that you need less rest time. Remember as you improve keep increasing the pace.      If you don't have a heart rate monitor - use your pulse take for 5 seconds and multiple by 12.  Running with your heart rate is the best indicator since other people recover sooner or later than your rate. What makes some runners better than others.  Also using this indicator will get you in better shape - since your heart doesn't lie and will give you an edge with exercise physiology or science.  Good luck!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	You should check out the Runners World website. They have all this information and more.

AA11488609	Because they are damn good with the best coach in men's college basketball.  The Duke hate has also spread to Duke women's ball in recent years because of the Coach G and now Coach P eras.  To stay on men's ball, which is where the Duke hate came from in the first place, they've won three NCAA championships in the 64 team tourney era when you had to win six games to win it all (1985 is when it started I'd like to say), and that's more than every other school, period in this era.  Duke is also really good because Coach K is great at recruiting players who fit into and buy into his system based on pressure man to man defense and a free flow tempo offense which has been quicker paced or slower paced depending on the personnel and depth of the team.  In addition, Coach K has had relatively few players who leave school early for the NBA without graduating, and coaches who are able to retain players over the long haul are able to be better over longer sustained periods of time rather than short outbursts which can be cyclical like in year one the team makes the final four, and the next year, they only can get in the second round at best, etc.|`|Z0BNqCVAaa	Nobody likes a dynasty except its own fans. As long as Mike K. has been coach there, they have been successful and ranked, every single year. It doesn't help that their student body whack jobs that pass for fans are known for their arrogance and regularly occurring lack of class. So everyone saying that they have no chance to do well is kind of like....group wishing.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Everyone has always dislikeed them|`|6tqGKoREaa	Because Duke is private and most believed they are spoiled brats who act like idiots at home games.  As long as they have Coach K they will do well.  Duke is the Notre Dame of Basketball.|`|dak2csghaa	People are going against Duke right now because the prejudice that a famous sportscaster (Dick Vitale) has for the Blue devils. The man cannot broadcast any game without comparing the action to something that has happend at Duke..    It really is quite annoying and people take it out on the team instead of the biased announcer..|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	this is why duke sucks    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYOgC2Qbq...|`|v3guYicKaa	Every year they have a chance to win.|`|7zphFd7Naa	I like duke|`|hQj1s1Maaa	Im a Kentucky Wildcat fan so I have carried the Duke Hater grudge since the greatest game ever in 1992.  Beyond my personal hate, though I think it's because they are always a threat.  Also I was SO happy to see someone else point out Dick Vitale's slobbering all over Duke every single chance he gets.  That definitely adds to it.

nRBC4E5saa	No.  Body building is not "athletic", in the same vein as martial arts is.  A martial arts weight-lifting routine should include both explosive lifts, for power, and light-weight/high-rep exercises for tendon strength and muscular endurance.  Body building exercises are designed to make you look big, which is antithetical to being a good fighter.  A fighter should be lean, not huge.  Excess muscles burn up oxygen.|`|JaTjoLNlaa	not really.. it depends on the weights.  bodybuilders always lift heavy and try to max out.   martial artists that lift weights lift regular weights for 20 to 30 reps. this is for endurance or definition.  but most martial artists stay away from weights. they believe it makes them less flexible. so they stick to calisthenic exercises.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	To me there is no real answer to this question. Many people take martial arts for different reasons, people lift weights for different reasons. It is up to the artist to set his/her personal goals and meat them. It is not for me to say you need to do plyometrics if the persons goals are to be a body builder type and be a BB in shotokan.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	No, there is a huge difference.  Weight lifting for body building is done in such a way to build and add bulk making your muscles bigger.  A lot of your muscles become shortened and so that is why you see some loss of flexibility and range of motion, especially in the shoulders.  I was just working on this with a student last week who is 5'5" and 235 lbs of muscle.  The guy is in great shape but can't straighten his arm out all the way on a jab for instance as his muscles have become so shortened.  This will change over some time with some work and effort on his part but it just exemplifies what I am saying.  You are usually lifting heavy, low number of reps and only certain body parts each day.  This works the and builds the size and strength of the muscle more and why body builders tend to lift this way.      Weightlifting for martial arts usually is low to medium weight and high number of reps and a circuit type workout.  This tends to build strength, speed, and power and doesn't effect the rang of motion and flexibility of a person so much.  It also does not build the size of the muscle so much by shortening it and a person will retain more flexibility and range of motion by doing this type of workout and not bulk up as much.|`|b236e9c68adebf7ae2fb536ad0c0a09aaa	No. Body builders lift weights in a manner to make themselves look huge and cut. Most martial artists if they even lift weights they do not usually do it for just the mass they want to gain not only strength but endurance too.    Many times bodybuilder's strength is deceiving they are not as strong as they look. If you look at people in strongman competitions they do not look like bodybuilders. Their is just a science for them putting on mass and exercising and eating in a manner to accomplish this.    I true martial artist would go for performance over looks. And I personally would go for endurance over strength|`|w74qWx0raa	Body building can actually be a negative . It teaches your body improper muscle use. You should be using your body as one weapon, not an assortment of different muscles each acting on there own like you teach your self to do on machines . A punch comes from the feet up  and the hips. And On the ground you should not be tring to bicep curl your arm out of danger. isolation moves are bad and also body builders tend to do a lot of reps. Any more the 5 reps and the weight is to light  The whole 15 to 20 rep for endurance thing is bull too though. And lots of martial artists have done that. You don't automatically gain mass when you lift heavy and you don't slow down either. Other things such as lack of flexibility slow you down. To much mass in the wrong places can to probably mass is not my area. Things such as  long 3 to 5 min rest between sets and  low volume high frequency trainging can make you strong as a bull with out adding mass training|`|fRosDAZEaa	It depends on your goals.  If you are trying to go up in weight, then perhaps for a short period yes, but never exclusively, unless of course you are a professional body builder.
oMjVp4zGaa	All the lakes you can launch a boat at are very well (over) fished by anglers and clubs. Imagine every angler that owns his own business goes fishing on every half day off he has. The state of california almost issues more licenses than the rest of the U S combined. The lakes are all over fished but Casitas has been closed due to a quagga mussel infestation. It is closed to outside boats but you can rent still (I think). In Los Angeles County there is Puddingstone, Santa Fe Dam, Castaic, Pyramid In San Diego there is Dixon, Moreno, Hodges, Wolford, Otay Mesa. In Orange County is Irvine lake, Laguna Nigel Park lake and In Ventura is Piru, Casitas, and in Santa Barbara is Cachuma. Riverside county has Diamond Valley, Perris, Palomar, Vail, Skinner and Elsinore. San Bernardino has Big Bear, Silverwood and Arrowhead. I have fished them all for bass I swear to you though the best fight in the near to easy to get to waters is in the back bays and harbors up and down the coast The spotted bay bass is pound for pound a better fight on light line and freswater tactics. The plus side is the calico bass fight from where they live on the breakwalls, the sand bass on the bottom near by and the inevitable halibut that takes artificials as fast as they see them gives a good reason to fish closer to home and bring home the legal halibut for dinner. Below is from the D F G  read the article on the big bass lakes. Good luck mate.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	north, to castaic, piru, casitas or even isabella.  lots of lakes east of you. perris, silverwood, puddingstone, big bear, diamond valley.  irvine also has bass in there along with those big trout (thumbs, steelhead) and all the san diego lakes.  unfortunately, not much IN L.A.  a ways further, the colorado river has miles of good bass fishing.  believe it or not, the los angeles river has lots of fish. l don't know about bass but there are carp and cats. l believe crappie too. but l wouldn't eat any of them.|`|ziPiHdcHaa	That one lake there by the road.
xOReEw6Waa	There is no minimum hunting age in Washington. My 11 year old did his hunter's ed course in Spokane and we were able to go deer hunting no problem and would have gone elk hunting if he could shoot a large enough caliber. Do your Hunter Ed and you should be fine, but you need to say how old you are now, because I would only let my son shoot the 30-06 once and it was a little too much for him. Washington has a reduced hunting rate for youth hunting for deer, but for elk you pay full tag cost. But if you can't shoot a caliber suitable for elk proficiently then stay with deer for a while. My son is great with his 243.
uSPxe2Bbaa	Pretty good, but won't be the greatest.|`|IjV8hlE0aa	Hatem Ben Arfa actually 21 year old is the big promise for France national team and of course for Olympique Lyonnais itself. I think he will grow up into the future T. Henry but he needs to keep improving, but no doubt he is pretty good striker.

02edb29b41ca2fb47a0dbeed229eabccaa	A good team possesses; a great defense, a great offense , great attackers and most of all great goal scorers.  The world as it is, look at a good team as one that made prior presence at the world cup.  Sometimes the underdog teams can pull an upset in world cup if given the chance.  The referee almost always, will favor the historical team (s) no matter how bad they play.|`|AA11639799	The strength or weakness of a team is based on who is playing for the team.  History has very little to do with it.    Most of the players in the World Cup are playing in various professional leagues around the world.  Based on their play, we know who the best players are.  And the countries that have the best players will usually have the best team.    The better players are bigger, faster, quicker, stronger, jump higher and playing at a higher level than players who aren't so good.    However, when they play a game, the favorite doesn't always win, and there is an element of luck that comes into play.  Think of a penalty kick.  Many times, the goalie will 'guess' which way the ball is going to be kicked.  If he guesses right, he makes a save.  If he guesses wrong, it's a goal.  If a team gets more quality scoring chances by its play, it usually translates into more goals.  But not always.    Other things, such as penalties, injuries, misplays, etc, can temporarily open things up for an underdog team to attack a favored team.  It's possible.  But underdog teams usually need to have a lot more 'breaks' in order to defeat a favored team.|`|b42c32efd9ab134681da390ef5f3dcb2aa	Soccer is game where anything can happen. Many people call it a fluke when underdog teams win teams like Brazil, Italy, etc.   Teamwork and the understanding of each other, in my opinion, is the most important thing when making a good team. Of course you need to know the basics like passing, shooting, etc. But most all teams know how to those things. Tricks i think is not very importnat in a soccer match. It may be entertaining, but good passing and shooting might be better, Headers. I think brazil is very united and each player knows each other, i think thats why they're very successful.|`|126bfea064dab180f9dbd5f3906a914faa	They are just the teams with the historical presence in the World Cup.|`|c0ecedddf1d17bf9744fd6e7377ff8bdaa	Teams with a past history in the world cup constitute a good team, also teams that have made it further in the past.  There are some new teams into the world cup which weren't considered good just because they haven't proven themselves in the world cup, however sometimes they surprise us like Ukraine did this year, they're a relitively new team and they lost their first world cup game 4 - 0 and made world cup history in making it to the quarter finals.
