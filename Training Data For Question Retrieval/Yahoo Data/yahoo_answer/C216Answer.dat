Even if there are softer blades, it is not safe.<br>  <br>  Moving blades can hurt a child even if they are softer.  Consider this, a leather belt is soft, but when applied to a child's bottom by hitting it hurts like the dickens.<br>  And if they are very soft, let's say he reaches for it and tries to grab - he could be stretching to reach it thinking he'd have something to hold on to and end up falling from the bunk.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Experience is the best teacher. Children must learn to obey there parents in all things.
2f6diQBiaa	She should not take them together. The instructions are usually to take provera to start her period (I'm assuming she has irregular cycles and that's why she's on provera). After she starts her period, she should take the Clomid on whatever cycle days the doctor told her (usually 3-7 or 5-9). She should ovulate 5-10 days after taking her last pill.<br>  <br>  Provera will interfere with the effectiveness of Clomid if they are taken at the same time. I'm not sure if you should wait another month or not. I would call your doctor and ask her how to proceed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|wom2ER4Baa	yes u r not suppeded to take clomid with provera once periods have come from day 5 start taking clomid

iP863XM6aa	Well, one thing that motivated me when i was a kid to stay clean was seeing pictures of really gross disgusting people. <br>  To get me to crush my teeth, all i had to do was be shown a picture of a person with really bad yellow/black teeth and bleeding gums. Trust me, that image stuck with me and i never forgot to brush my teeth. <br>  The whole brushing the hair before bed thing i find kind of weird because you end up messing it up over night anyways. i just brush it when i wake up. If the socks dont match and shes going out, whats the big deal? there in shoes anyways. <br>  <br>  When it comes to hygiene, its important to keep them clean healthy wise. But when it comes to just the way she looks physically, then you shouldnt push to much unless she is dressing up like a little sl*t like you see to often these days. Not tucking in the pocket never hurt anyone, zip your pants, thats just a normal thing to do. Wear a bras.. at 10? does she even have any that young? get her a sports bras. Underwire bras probably arent comfortable for her. And deoderant? Does her sweat even smell that young? If it does, then just ask her if she really wants to be stinky around others. If she doesnt smell, let it be.<br>  <br>  You shouldnt be teaching her that she has to look perfect looks wise.. shes just a child! it shouldnt be in her head that she has to look good. Health wise, just explain to her the importance.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Easy. You have to do it when the child is young. 4yo Kylie and I brush teeth together, wash faces, often bathe together (if I'm at home or she bathes alone), wash feet, wash hands together before dinner, clean the room together, check the clothes if they are dirty (together!), etc. My parents did the same for me when I was 3-4yo and at your daughter's age nobody had to care about MY hygiene. I did it myself because I knew it's normal and healthy and good.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	It will get better.  Sooner or later, she's going to notice that all of her classmates are paying attention to the way they look.  And she's going to want to be the same way.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest that you simply stop nagging her.If she wears dirty pjs to bed, why does that matter?  If she wears the same outfit 2 days in a row, so what?  If her clothes don't match, that's her problem, not yours.  If she doesn't wear that bra, say nothing.  Dont let her entice you into an argument.<br>  <br>  See to it that her teeth are brushed and her hair is brushed. Stand over her till that's done. And let the rest of it go.  Pretty soon, one of her friends is going to tease her for wearing the same outfit 2 days in a row.  Or tell her bluntly, in front of her whole crowd, that her clothes don't match.<br>  <br>  That is the day that she is going to start caring what she wears.Trust me.  We've just been there with my 10 yr old granddaughter.<br>  <br>  Edit... you apparently left out the part about your wanting to raise a princess, not a normal little girl.  So what if she gets sweaty at night in pjs?  She can shower, can't she?<br>  <br>  And, ya know what?  No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to be there and prevent teasing for her whole life long.  If you step in constantly, and manage every bit of her life so she doesn't get teased, how is she ever going to learn to handle it when she does get teased?  Believe me, we all get teased sometimes.<br>  <br>  We learn from our mistakes.  Your child deserves that chance, too.|`|TiaoTFecaa	You need to explain to her why she needs to do these things if you haven't already.  My 8 year old is the same way but he isn't allowed to have any fun until he takes care of himself.<br>  <br>  Just like when your older if you dont go to work well you wont have a job.  If you dont clean yourself well you wont be clean you will be dirty and stink and nobody will want to be near you|`|d7kGopYxaa	Well when i was ten i had the same problem. My mom showed me pictures of how teeth look underbrushed, and how hair will tangled s bad you have to cut all your hair off. Not to mention how the teasing is going to be worse for the years to come if she doesn't take a bath or shower. I recommend getting her some yummy smelling body wash and yummy smelling hair wash.  It scared me so much that I wash my face with acne face wash twice a day.<br>  <br>  Let her choose the body wash and hair wash and deodorant. She will appreciate it much more.|`|jsxphZJEaa	Yes, this is frustrating. It happened with only one of my children, the rest were fine. I have no idea why. We stopped it by age 7 by:<br>  One - showing her pics of smelly dirty people, people with no teeth, <br>  two - explaining that we live in civilized society and this is how we live<br>  three- taking away all TV while dressing in AM, <br>  four - taking away things she likes til she gets point<br>  five - talking with her rationally at night, not in AM<br>  six - to prove the point, one day we did not brush teeth, or take shower and worked out side in heat, she realized how horrible we smelled and we never had another problem.<br>  <br>  This is not a phase, this child needs to be taught this is not acceptable, she sounds lazy (sorry) like my child was, who was very bright, but lazy. Everything was a chore to complete, it definately ruined times until we got her past this lazy part of life. We made serious rules, many chores and consequences for no doing them.  <br>  Make her do her laundry wash, dry, fold, put away, stand over her if necessary, be as drill seargeant. You are her mother and have every right to do so. <br>  <br>  Yes, you are right you should have started earlier, but she is the age sge is, you can;t change that. You must work from here, and yes, she should wear a bra, and deoderant. I agree who cares on sock color except wearing matching socks teaches  responsibility. A shower every day is a must also, and yes, no wearing smelly , dirty clothes to bed, and brushing hair yes, eliminates tangles for AM brushing.  I think that she needs motivation and only you know how to motivate your child. Personally, I feel more chores, less TV is a good place to start, no video games, CD's etc.  Modern technology has made children and adults lazy. Time to be responsible and have respect for self.<br>  Try a trip to dentist to discuss hygeniene and also the medical doctor, to explain why it is important to be clean.|`|PUdWfF0yaa	This worked for my 9 yr old son, I would do those thing with him. When it's time to brush teeth, we would do it together. I'm not saying take a shower with your child though. Make it to be fun, not to be a chore. Kids follow better by example. Good luck.

F8iyUqJBaa	30.  When I was 20 I was enjoying life and having fun.  My first son was born a month before I turned 28 and I'm 33 about to have my 4th.  This is the family expanding time of my life and I'm enjoying it.  When I'm in my 40's I would like to be done and enjoying my children growing at that point.  My parents had me in their 30's and they are still thriving and enjoying their grandchildren.  <br>  I know some who are in their 20's who have babies and they are very immature and use their babies as a popularity prop for themselves.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I was 23 when I had my first, one of my friends was 34. We discussed the pros and cons and said the main differences were that a young mother usually has more energy, but an older (btw, 30 is absolutely by no means old) mother has more patience.<br>  How old are you? i'm sure when you get near to 30 you'll realise how odd it sounds to be calling it old. Naturally speaking, women are meant to pro-create right up until the menopause, 30 is nowhere near it.|`|ABOvm38Caa	31 when I had my first.  Glad I waited because I was able to do things, such as travel and get my degree, so now I have so much more to offer my children than I would if I were to have had them when I was 20.  But, sometimes you just don't know where life is gonna take you.  Children are a blessing at any age.|`|sqR0iyuWaa	30.|`|AA11352641	30. I'd rather spend my 20's having fun.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I'm 23 and I've had a child at 17 and at 23.

For me, twenty was too young and 30 would have been too old.  I was married at age 23 (which looking back on it was really young) and we had our first child when I was 27, which was great.  If I had to choose, I would choose 30 over 20.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	I would have loved to be 20.  I am 27 with no babies.  So guess I am leaning towards 30.

Believe me, I do know and I speak from experience. I had my first son now 42 at 20 and then my second was born at 35. I was absolutely estatic...then number 3 came at 37 as I was determined not to raise another only child because my first one was 15 at the birth of my second and nothing in common which is only obvious.<br>  <br>  Have a great day....|`|IVHzjGn9aa	Life's just getting started at 20.

I'd say they both have their pros and cons. for example, if you have them young you will have more of your life left when they are grown, and you are probably more fun because you actually remember what it was like to be a kid. The down side, you may have some resentment for not being able to go out and have a social life, so if you like to party wait until you're older. When you are in your 30's and have children you know a bit ,more than you did when you were 20. your views and such have changed and maybe you have more patience or you are content because you were able to have guilt free fun in your 20's. You are usually more financially secure and have a better grip on reality, and how much work it is to raise a child. The down side is not having as much time with your children as you would have at 20. And maybe not having much time to play, or be silly with them.<br>  IDK, just my personal opinion having done both. If I had it to do over, I most likely would have probably waited a few more years before having children. Hope this helped.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	25 would be the best age because you still have enough energy to race around after them and enough memory to know what it was like to be in school. 20 is a bit young because you are still getting a feel for being an adult. (Can't even drink till 21)<br>  <br>   30 really isn't that old. My sister is 40 and she is trying for her first. She didn't get married until 40, so..... she couldn't have started any earlier.
wipJ9OE7aa	Well, I saw a clip of this story on the news and I waited and waited for them to show the story but I never saw it... So, I'm glad that you posted it. Anyway, I think that this "wedding" was more of a friendship thing, I think that the whole idea was for them to just spend time together as friends and I highly doubt that the parents would even think of them having sex. It had nothing to do with a real wedding in that sense. So, no. Just friendship and fun.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Helll, nawww!   What the helllll does a nine year old know about marriage, and they're not even thinking about such a thing at that age anyway!  I think that news link that you have posted regarding the nine year old and the seven year old is almost some sort of child pornography unplugged or something.  What the hellll is the world coming to?  Kids aren't on that level of thinking!  That is just parents acting out some sicko child exploitation or indecency even though the girl is terminally ill and the boy is recovering!|`|Rk87mqkoaa	I would allow them do whatever they want. They are dying. at least one of them. And, God, the 7yo can't pick up his **** to have sex, how do you imagine them having sex???|`|y4VWVD94aa	uhm, what? no way, wth.|`|AA12145826	Ok, you went straight from a legitimate question to bordering on perverted so I'll just answer the real question part.<br>  <br>  Would I allow my dying child the opportunity to experience the razzle-dazzle that often accompanies a wedding (and is probably what the little girl was focused on when she said she had "always dreamed of her wedding day")? Yes. She's focused on the party part and maybe the hope of wanting to have the "forever and ever, amen" after being told she can't and won't be able to because she is dying. At 9, do you really think she gets the whole concept of a wedding? No, she wants the fairy tale. She wants to live long enough to some day have a wedding. It was a dying girls last wish, nothing more.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	I saw this on the news.  She married her best friend.  They met at the hospital.  I've never been in these parents' shoes, but if my child were dying, I'd do nearly anything to give them the life they wanted in that short amount of time.  Some little girls dream of the big wedding day.  That's what this little girl wanted and she got it.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a little out there, I agree, but it's not like they consumated the darned thing.  And NO, why would you even ask about the sex thing.  That's just crazy.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	So really your whole question is, "did they have sex?" Well of course they didn't, the boy is 7 you idiot!<br>  It says they went on a honeymoon with the parents. That doesn't include sleepovers. These kids are really ill and you are a nut for asking this question.<br>  Good lord.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	No I wouldn't.  Also why are you being so defensive?  Your the one who brought up sex, to me your the one that needs to examine your head.  Why would you even think that?|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	Of course not! You mean you'd drag someone else into your pain? ;-(=|`|7rZmvqO8aa	WTF kinda question is this?|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	No.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	WTF? there is no way in hell that is actually real, because im pretty sure if it was they'd all be arrested!|`|Q1MPlkhjaa	I read the news article, and the whole situation is just so sad. To be told as a 9 year old that you only have a few weeks to live, and to have to come to terms with that, makes this 9 year old girl older beyond her years. And if one of her last dying wishes was to get married to the boy she developed a bond to, then I would allow her to. As for the sex part, I don't believe the parents agreed to the wedding and thought sex between the two was expected. I think that the kids bond in marriage symbolized their bond in their friendship, their love for each other and the bond they share in the frailty of life. Every little girl wants to dress up and have her dream day, and every little boy plays house with a girl one way or another, so I say let them have their day, because they may not be able to make it through tomorrow.|`|Ziyl4xNMaa	I personally, think 9 is too young for marriage and for sex.|`|FPGgaI3Yaa	yes|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	no way|`|eHrc9NPcaa	uhhh no!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	no to both.<br>  <br>  that's fair to the surviving young kid how?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	If my kid only had a couple of weeks to live. I would let them do whatever they wanted to. Provided it wouldn't hurt anyone.
hKJIDdVqaa	I tend not to 'punish' my children.  I do not ground, take things away, beat etc.  It is senseless.  Sending my children to their room is the next best thing to heaven, they get peace and quiet, there are video games and toys.  No way, I lecture.  I make sure they know and understand what they did wrong.  Why they should not do that, and the outcome of the situation.  My children think that is just horrible to have sit and listen to a lecture.  It works great. Often times kids will do wrong because they have no idea what right is.  It is our job as parents to teach them.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Get a large plank of 2x4 and hammer in a nail, then....<br>  Just kidding.<br>  I was a teenager once, and I know how awful I was, so my advice to parents is, ignore the wining, whinging and constant misery.  They are just doing it to get a rise from you.<br>  <br>  Do not let them push it, whatever they say, they don't need whatever it is they're asking for.<br>  <br>  I would say the best form of punishment is withholding pocket money and privileges - teenagers are adult size and if they are bloody minded, they could just walk out, but if they've no money in their pocket, and can't buy anything they want, they'll soon realise you mean business.  <br>  <br>  I would also never let them have locks on their bedroom doors, and threaten to remove any tv, video games etc.  Remind them that they're just a child.|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	Spend time with your teenager(s) and get them out of their normal surroundings where they can let their guard down and talk with you - i.e. take them camping, go away to someplace you've never been, go on an adventure,....  Punishment is a way to deal with bad behavior, but it's not always going to get to the root of the problem.  In fact, it could make things worse.  You need to foster a relationship with open communication so if they are struggling with something they will feel comfortable talking to you about it. - - - Not that punishment is unnecessary - they still have to understand that bad behavior is not tolerated and there are consequences for their actions.  They have to understand that you are punishing the action though and that you still love them (and it's because you love them that you are disciplining them).|`|Y5IUse1vaa	Teenagers can be a nightmare. They believe that they are already old enough to make life choices. The most successful way to punish them is to take away thier freedom, by grounding them. There is no violence involved in this, but it can hit them really hard as they will have no contact with their mates until the grounding is complete!! You might tell them that they are grounded for a fortnight, but if they show remorse and help around the house, you can tell them that they will be able to use the computer to speak to their mates after one week. That usually does the trick..You have to remember that teenagers have loads of raging hormones and do not usually mean to upset you with thier actions. If you let them see that you are willing to come and go with them, they will be more co-operative. Your best bet is to stick to whatever punishment that you dish out. If you crumble, they will know that they can manipulate you and will continue to do so. My mate has a teenage daughter and she tried "bribing" her with treats, which did not work. She eventually laid down the law and her daughter respected her for that. The best of luck, teenagers can try your patience!!!|`|yBhzrHdEaa	Well, actually it depends on what age the teenager is because usually each teenager goes through the stage when they dont wasnt to be botherd and are sometimes being bitchy but for as tallking you should come at a time when they are usually relaxed and maybe try to talk to them on their level in a calm and loving way but dont push it!     Try not to accrovate them everyday trying to talk or yelling at them because it make s it wworse and they eventually wouldnt want to be botherd with oyu at all
qYVyZqq2aa	ask a medical doctor|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	You can't know for sure whether she is allergic to something - children can develop allergies very quickly.

vygYFdsSaa	Just because you had a miscarriage in September doesn't increase your chances of having another one. I'm very sorry for your loss. Try to think positive and not worry too much about another m/c.|`|8RfmosODaa	Sorry for your lost. I am sure you and your baby will be ok! Alot of woman miscarry and don't even know it! I think that is plenty of time in between pregnancies! I just miscarried January 3rd of this year and am trying to wait 3 months before we try again.  Try to relax and enjoy your pregnancy! I know sometimes that seems hard to do after a m/c. Congrats!!|`|5X6C4s7zaa	I miscarried in Oct of 08 at 15 weeks amd I am now 8 weeks pregnant so I am just as nervous as you are, but really all you can do is just relax and take it one day at a time.....you & your baby will be fine|`|t1wH1uRZaa	there is always a chance of miscarriage. But if your not bleeding having stomach cramps or anything then don't worry. If it's gonna happen it is inevitable and you can't prevent it.

Thats the best you can do right now.|`|juU6nJqUaa	Miscarriage is more common than you would think.  Most people don't talk about it.  You should be fine.  <br>  <br>  Try to relax and enjoy!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	I don't think you should worry too much I had a miscarriage(d&c) in Nov'07 I then found out in Jan'08 (just2 months later) I was preggers again, I know have a healthy 5 month old son!!!  Don't stress about it too much it's bad for your body and the baby just be happy rest and take care of yourself you will be fine I just know it!!!

Booty call.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Don't, some things should be explained when they are older.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	If you are referring to a " booty" call then by the time they are 9 they should know basic details about sex, if not it is time to have "the talk".|`|V8wUAVdyaa	don't you mean 'booty call'?  ..and you should never explain something like that to a child!|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	You don't !|`|yBhzrHdEaa	what do they want to know what a booty caklkl is anyways just say it's whern you call your friend on the phone and you say their but is big.......JUST JOKING>............ a 9year old really shouldnt know about that but they old enough  to be able to know what it is|`|AA11537580	can you explain it to me? what's a BUTTY call?<br>  did you mean booty call?<br>  if you did then just say it's a privet date between adults and it's a word she isn't aloud to say because it isn't nice or something like that.|`|VHaSKFC2aa	You don't. You just say that one of your friends is coming over to stay the night with you to have a sleep over. Try to be quiet, and please don't endanger your child (IE very random meet-ups, drugs, way to much alcohol, etc). Have fun. :)|`|JlboSK9zaa	You say. listen here kiddo. a "Booty" call is when mommy likes to have sex with random ppl for fun. Knowing their name is not an option|`|85S7YRQdaa	I have no idea what a BUTTY call is but I would recommend no explaining it to a 9 year old|`|ygw1KFWSaa	That's child abuse in my opinion. You shouldn't explain things like that to a child!|`|bghotovYaa	You don't tell them!!<br>  Not when they are that young!!!
jBhY3Phpaa	I went through the same in the beginning of my pregnancy. I am now 12 and a half weeks. As long as your blood levels are increasing there is absolutely nothing to worry about! And if you start to feel sick, nauseated, it is also a good thing. It means your hormones are doing their job! It's easy to say be calm, and don't worry, but a lot harder to actually do it! It sounds like you are doing just fine! Good Luck!|`|SmWuSrHYaa	I am due shortly around the same time you are. I had some light spotting and they told me that as long as the spotting isn't as bad where I would need a pad then i am fine. She said it was normal. So just stop worrying. Congrats to you|`|RzYePezkaa	Everything will be fine I had some light spotting with my first born.Just take it easy and if the spotting increases and you get some pains with it call your doctor but it should be fine.Congrats and good luck|`|MmbEk1bTaa	those numbers are great! brown is usually ok, and heres a little secret...you never stop worrying, welcome to motherhood!!! GOD BLESS you and baby!!!|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Rub your belly, sing to your baby and pray to God to keep you both safe.

Congrats!!!|`|de5b83591cc1c2092e4a9f3cbc273709aa	The same thing happened to me and I have a healthy 9 month old baby girl! Congrats and cherish the next 9 months when you have your little one all to yourself. I am so happy for you!!!!!|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	had spotting with all 3 pregnancies and they all turned out healthy! although with the last my progesterone levels were low so they prescribed some for me and that seemed to help a little. i was never tested with the other two so maybe that was the problem every time-who knows...your levels are rising so i wouldnt be worried. i know its hard with the first one though :0)|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You're fine.  But stop stressing, that alone can cause problems and your baby can feel it.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Brown spotting is fine. It is just OLD blood that your body is getting rid of. Red is what you don't want. You just had a MAJOR increase in you levels so that is great. You are fine, your baby is fine and I wish you a very happy pregnancy. Try to stop worrying now and enjoy being pregnant and look forward to that little one that you will be meeting in a few months.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	These are all good sings! Your levels have been increasing and are looking good! Don't stress, it's sounds like it's going well. Congrats!|`|05bf614d400b126e98a6f037a990f73aaa	Don't stress, think of you and your baby in about 8 months.|`|nwHqblWiaa	I really pray that everything will be okay for you. I had the same thing--light brown spotting for about 2-3 days before my miscarriage began. Everyone kept telling me that it was normal--blah blah blah! It may be normal but it wasn't the case for me! I miscarriage 5 days after finding out that I was pregnant. I wish you the best of luck though. I really do!<br>  <br>  edit; how did i ever guess that id get a thumbs down for being honest? im sorry. i just wanted to give you my honest opinion.. and give you a heads up to what CAN/MAY happen. i was really hurt that everyone kept telling me it was normal...when i really don't think that it is! ;\
2f6diQBiaa	So you basically had a 22 day cycle with 2 days of spotting? Are your cycles usually regular, and if so how long? <br>  <br>  I don't think that what you describe necessarily indicates premature menopause. It could be a number of things, including that you just had a weird cycle due to stress, sleep, diet changes, etc. Stress can definitely play a role in messing with ovulation, so it might be as simple as that.<br>  <br>  If you've been TTC 2 years, though, it is good to do some tests. Other tests that I would recommend you ask the Dr. about are FSH (day 3- which may have been the "menopause" test), day 21 progesterone, and testasterone/androstenedione (to check for polycystic ovarian syndrome). Also, ask your doctor for a blood sugar test. Women who are insulin-resistant (like in diabetes) often have ovulatory dysfunction that is quickly fixed through medications.<br>  <br>  This website will show you all of the tests and what their numbers mean: <a href="http://www.fertilityplus.com/faq/hormonelevels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityplus.com/faq/hormone...</a> .<br>  <br>  I hope the results show that everything is fine! Best of luck to you and lots of baby dust!!!

EOaAQVdSaa	Really cute book-- The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicki Iovine. I love it, and I'm about halfway through. also, if you join babycenter.com, they send you emails each week to tell you how the baby is growing, what you should be eating, how you may be feeling, and basically, a full overview of what is going on that week. I love it. They have groups, like "first timers due in (month)," and things like that, where the girls share their questions and experiences that you can leave comments on. Articles and belly pictures, and you customize it to track you pregnancy.|`|DBKV3g4baa	I also read Belly Laughs and was somewhat entertained by the book.  I find myself returning to What To Expect When Expecting pretty often as it does answer the many new questions and concerns I have with each passing month.<br>  <br>  Most often, however, I turn to the internet as it has the most recent information (and also many stories from other mothers or expectant couples).|`|AA11206135	I'm not pregnant so I'm not reading any pregnancy books....

dq24rqtsaa	Technically, you would be 4 weeks pregnant this Saturday.<br>  <br>  The reason is, when determining your due date they count from the beginning of your last period.  Even though you wouldn't have conceived until about 2 weeks later, it's hard to pinpoint the exact day of conception, so doctors tend to go by the first day of your period because it's an exact date.<br>  <br>  So, technically, when you give birth (in a perfect world) at 40 weeks, your baby has actually only been in there for 38.  Strange, I know.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	you would be 4 or 5 weeks <br>  good luck !|`|Rpg8Feg2aa	Well it sounds like you could be just wait a little bit and take another test or go to a place like planned parent hood or a health department and get a blood test or something.<br>  Good Luck<br>  GOD BLESS   :)
nqkXE1cUaa	Your tummy grows, you feel the new life grow inside you… Must be wonderful, isn’t it?<br>  <br>  But if you have a belly piercing, you may be thinking - ‘…is it going to hurt my baby if I leave the belly ring while being pregnant?’<br>  <br>  And maybe your GP has told you better take out that belly ring while you’re being pregnant.<br>  <br>  Well… It’s not actually the case! First of all these days you can get a special pregnancy belly ring - it’s made from plastic, no metals involved, and it won’t hurt your baby! Secondly, no-one has observed any bad influence of those pregnancy belly rings to the unborn babies.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	With my first three I kept mine in the whole time. Nothing changed about it at all. It went back to normal after I had the baby each time. But this time, I am getting bigger and it was starting to get sore and the last thing I wanted was to catch it on something and pull it out..ouch! So I took it out about 3 weeks ago. Everyday I run the ring through to make sure it doesn't grow back. So far it hasn't. You don't HAVE to take it out, but if it becomes uncomfortable, I would.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  How ironic that a woman with the username ~BOOZY W~ tells us we are trashy bc we have a belly button ring. WTF is so trashy about a belly button ring??????<br>  <br>  LOL stereotype? What stereotype would I have? A 23 yr old stepdaughter that my husband and I put through college? She graduated with honors and now works as at IU med center?  A 13 year old son that is praised by his teachers, friend's parents, and everyone he knows as being the most well mannered, nicest 13 year they have ever met, a 4 year old that will be starting kindergarten this fall and will be enrolled in the gifted and talented class? And a 2 year old that was tested by the preschool and has the intellegence of most four year olds? Do I fit your stereotype? I am curious..What does my avitar or the fact that I have a belly button ring, say about me? Last time I checked you don't need a degree to be a bartender so i doubt that you are qualified to analyze anyone...and you are ready to judge me or the girl that asked this question bc we have a belly button piercing or because my avitar, which by the way, incase you didn't realize,  isn't a real picture of me..lol, looks a certain way? You and I def. agree on one thing..some people need to be caged.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	you should prob take it out soon because i think what i hear is it can cause infections  ask your doctor they will know the best answer|`|NIZN98coaa	oh dont. If it gets infected..just wait.|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	With my first pregnancy I took it out about half way through I believe.  I still pushed it through a couple times after my belly got really big, just to see if it had closed up or not.  I've had my piercing long enough that I could put my belly ring back in after I gave birth.  Now I am 15 weeks pregnant and I still have mine in.  I will take it out when I need to again, and put it right back in after I give birth.  I wouldn't really say there are Pros and Cons to keeping your belly ring in.  It can get uncomfortable later in your pregnancy and it can close up if you take it out.  As other people have said, there are plastic extenders that you can put in place of the metal barbell if you are worried it will close up.  They will have you take it out during labor, just in case you need a c-section.|`|DBKV3g4baa	I would wait until after.  I took mine out around 5 months, and though I don't think the piercing has closed up (I've had it just under 3 years now), the holes have stretched and the skin protrudes from my stomach slightly (earlier in my pregnancy, many people thought it was my belly button starting to pop out).  I also have stretch marks radiating out from the area now.<br>  <br>  They do make flexible jewelry that can be worn throughout your pregnancy, though I think most doctors would still recommend removing the jewelry.  Search online for 'maternity belly rings' or 'pregnancy belly rings' and you'll find a variety of suitable jewelry.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	My sister left hers in too long while prego. The hole stretched so it looked like she had it gaged. When she took the ring out you could look right through it. Now that she's back to her usual size it's a very ugly scare. I suggest you take it out at about 3-4 months. About the time you start showing.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	alot of piercing/tattoo places wont do anything if your pregnant. plus it will be a waste of money...you will have to remove it once you start showing anyway. just wait til you have the baby,|`|R8bXuLbTaa	I kept mine in till I was 7 months and it got a little tiny stretch mark on it but once I had my baby I put it right back in and it looks fine.<br>  <br>  Id keep it in unless it starts to get red or irritated.|`|p6XPhIxnaa	ugh you should take it out, its going to be nasty anyways, like your going to have a scar and stuff.|`|dCLnLlsCaa	I'm not sure what would happen if you kept it in.  I took mine out at around 4 months.  I do have a scar.|`|eytlIKITaa	Got to bodycandy.com they have special flexable bar bells for pregnant bellies!  And they're only $6!!!  Good luck!|`|QRaRbstAaa	well if you keep your belly button piercing in your belly button will stretch causing pain and your skin could possibly rip. But however you can buy a pregnancy belly button ring or barbell and you can keep that in up until delivery. The difference between a regular belly button ring and a pregnancy belly button ring is that the regular belly button ring is smaller and not made for skin stretching and the pregnancy belly button ring is longer and made just for pregnant women with their belly buttons pierced.  But when you go into labor and your ready to deliver most hospitals make you take them out no matter what.<br>  You can find pregnancy belly button rings at almost any body jewelry store, online, and most malls.<br>  oh and if you keep in your piercing and you don't go and buy a pregnancy one you should only keep it in until you notice the skin in and/or  around your belly button starting to stretch.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	At first, its not going to be a big deal, but as you tummy expands, it may rip you skin from the stretching.  My sister took hers out early in the pregnancy and just went to have it done after her little boy was 2 months.  Of course she didn't have any stretchmarks.  Thats a big thing too.  A belly button ring with stretchmarks.  No point in having one.|`|h93SVSxLaa	i left mine in for full term on both pregnancies. i have a small little X around it that you can only see if you move the ring around to see it. i say leave it in... no worries if you don't mind the extra stretch mark.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: They don't ALWAYS make you take it out either I took mine out with my second an hour before i went in to have my tubes tied 13 hours AFTER having her. It's NOT trashy like the comments are saying, it's NOT going to hurt the baby. Mine never even got uncomfortable the bigger i got. It's a personal choice.|`|GSIHc6nQaa	Pros:<br>  Your nable with look fancy and nice lol.<br>  You can show it off to others.<br>  <br>  Cons: <br>  You can get an infection.<br>  They infection can spread and the baby might catch it.<br>  It can leave a scar.<br>  It might hurt while your stomach is expanding. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|eXcXhSmIaa	you can get longer bars if you want to keep it in, but end of the day u will prob end up taking it out due to ur tummy stretchin and it may not be comfortable|`|QYahxUEWaa	3month usually when your belly start growing it will just push the ring out and then the wound will be bigger and risky so the sooner the better i will say.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	My sister and my cousin both had their belly buttom pierced while they were pregnant, they left it in and everything was ok. I think its a personal choice.|`|o4kuVqHqaa	How attractive - a belly button ring on a pregnant woman...(note the sarcasm) You're pregnant...it's time to grow up now...take it out!|`|WecTdlZ5aa	When I found out I was pregnant I took mine out so it would have time to heal up before my belly got bigger.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what - it leaves an ugly scar! =(|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	now you are to be a mother why is it so impt to have it? take it out.|`|UHQGlOPlaa	why would you get one in the first place|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Con, it can close up if you take it out.  They now have extenders for the ring that you can wear throughout your pregnancy.|`|8RfmosODaa	My sister had a scar from hers but i think it just depends on your body. I have a belly button ring also and i was wondering about that when I get pregnant again. I guess you could keep it in til it looks like it needs to come out.  Ive seen women keep theirs in and be fine.

So hopefully he will be here soon!!!|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Yes.  Do take care of yourself.  You don't want the stress (wanting to see your new baby) to affect the baby you're carrying negatively.  <br>  <br>  Relax.  Clean the house.  Get a haircut and pamper yourself (you won't get a chance once the baby arrives.)  You have about three weeks (maybe earlier) to go.  Get all of your favorite music together.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Every child develops at their own pace and development can vary.  Please disregard what other parents say unless they are saying something you already have a concern about.  Sadly, many parents get competitive about their children, comparing and judging that their children are 'so much more advanced' than other children their age.  If you have any concerns about your child's development then  talk to your pediatrician.  Keep in mind that many of the answers on yahoo can be dead wrong - people giving their opinion doesn't mean they are right, and some answers I've seen are just like monkeys playing, they like to screw with your mind.  Don't play into fears.  Your child sounds wonderfully delightful.|`|E2XbFVBQaa	Ha Ha I think it's really funny when some people freak out over something pretty insignificant. So what if your child doesn't point yet. He will and eventually you'll be begging him to stop it. Just enjoy him now at this young age and he will start to develop on his own schedule. And also if you are really concerned about it then call your pediatrician and ask if there is a reason to be concerned. But personally I think he is fine.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	He seems to be doing well to me.  As an educator you know that children learn at different paces.

Sounds like your better off without the pointing.|`|oiJITSNZaa	I definitely wouldn't worry. What's the big deal anyways? It just saves you embarrassment of  having him point at people!!

My son has autism and he does none of what your child does and he is almost 3 yrs old.  I would not worry about it if the only thing he does not do is point|`|a76728313dc8f0da3cb0cd4227b335beaa	Don't let one rotten answer spoil the good ones.  You are looking for confirmation that you child is on track.  He is.  Do you know this person you answered critically?  Are they an expert or something?  Even if they were, so what.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	Though your son probably should be pointing by now I don't think my son did it that much earlier either.  I want to say my son started around 14 or 15 months.  I'm not sure exactly but I know I was a little concerned about it as well.  I don't think your son is that far behind other children.  Do you point to things?  Maybe start to point out things around him and he may just start picking up at it.  Thats what I did and eventually my son started to point and he points at everything.  He is know almost 18 months.
B1FqOGX1aa	Hi Hannah! Girl dont worry!!! Im sure everything is ok! I remember with my sister in law that just gave birth to my god daughter 3 weeks ago, was almost 7 weeks pregnant and they only saw a Sac and nothing else!!! And it all turned out PERFECT! and on Feb.2 ALyssa was born Healthy and so very beuatiful!! SO cheer Up!!! You'll be fine!!! :)|`|1xsUVtzBaa	i was at 10 weeks when all i saw was a sac...which dated at around 6 weeks ..it was a blighted ovum and i went on to miscarry. Sometimes you need to wait up to 8 weeks to get a heartbeat...or the position of the baby is off. At 6 weeks however you should see a heartbeat...your dates could be off too?|`|H0fXySX9aa	at 4 weeks there is a gestaional sac <br>  at 5 weeks a yolk sac<br>  6 weeks onwards a fetal pole<br>  i saw my baby at 6 weeks 1 day could your dates be out at 5 weeks there should be a yolk sac as well|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	At 8 weeks I saw a heartbeat and a peanut shaped baby|`|Rpg8Feg2aa	I seen my baby at 11 weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOD BLESS|`|lHjXeN8oaa	i had one at 9wks that you could tell there was a baby in there|`|8RfmosODaa	I was 8 weeks with my son. I think it may be too early to see just yet with yours. They saw a sac so that is good.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Did the sonographer indicate that you might not be that far along? You can usually see the fetus (just a blob) and a heartbeat by 6.5 weeks.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Well I wanted to have an ultrasound at around 6 weeks and my doctor didn't want to do it because she felt I'd worry more since there wouldn't be much to see. I've had 2 miscarriages. We waited till 16 weeks and there was my baby. She's due next Wednesday. So don't worry by your next ultrasound you'll see a lot. Then the weeks will fly by and you'll have your baby.|`|i8Ch743Laa	the fetus doesn't look like a baby at this point. It's more of a blob thing,and it's super tiny. I had an ultrasound done at 6 1/2 weeks,so the heartbeat was there.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	My first scan was at 7 weeks 4 days and it didn't look like anything, just a little blob with a little fluttering heart! I wouldn't have known which end was the head if the tech hadn't told me!|`|5X6C4s7zaa	It still might be a little early to see the baby.  I just had an ultrasound on Tuesday at 7w 5 days and all I saw was a blob and the yolk sac but I got to hear his/her heartbeat :o)
kvYgopThaa	Just be there for her, listen to her, and explain to her why you don't think she should get an abortion. But don't push her on the subject if this is truly what she wants and she isnt doing it just to please her parents. Although you may not agree with the abortion (i wouldn't agree either) its ultimately her deccision and she really just needs a friend around right now.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Regarding the previous poster -- there are heartbreaking stories for both abortion and adoption.  There are also positive stories for both situations.  <br>  <br>  If you REALLY want to help your friend, just be supportive of whatever she decides.  At 15, she isn't physically, emotionally, or spiritually ready for pregnancy and childbirth, and she shouldn't be forced to endure it.  By the same token, however, abortion is a difficult choice to make, and it should be hers alone.  If it is not the right choice for her, she should not let anyone to force her into it.<br>  <br>  So, be there for her.  Listen to her.  Let her talk, let her cry.  If she decides on abortion, do not give her a hard time.  Go with her, and hold her hand in the waiting room.|`|AA11542929	well if it was meant to be not aborted something woulda happened.. everythng happends for a reason.. maybe god didnt want her to do that so the only way to prevent it was that way not to sound mean but thats the way this world works.. if she keeps it and goes thru with the pregnancy god wanted that baby to be born for some reason.. if god didnt want that baby in this world she woulda never been pregnant.. i know i sound mad religious and im not.. but i do believe in god.. he saved me and my family alot of times we had a car accident and almost died from the ditch that we almost ended up in but we didnt we all made it out alive and safe and we werent wearing seatbelts either.. so imagine how much i believe in him now.. but she should keep it and see where it takes her..|`|lHjXeN8oaa	okay so i am a fatalist .... the car accident should be a good indicator that this is the wrong choice for her.  a good idea could be to look up stories from women/girls who have had abortions - many of them regret the decision and it carries through with them all of their lives.  i would share these stories with your friend and her family and maybe they will give their choice a second thought...
joPJtKemaa	if you don't know the answer to this question, you should not be having sex at all.|`|mC838ZbLaa	No; are you kiddin me? seriously? I mean we all like to have a laugh but honestly.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	If you have to ask this, you have no business having ANY kind of sex.|`|AA11765580	Um, no but you can pick up an STD.  You better get yourself educated if you are sexually active.|`|ZDnLfB5daa	No because in order to get pregnant the sperm must retch and egg, which are in the ovaries.|`|7xit1ogxaa	You are way to young to be fooling around.|`|MY68dYfaaa	wat?! tell me that this is not a serious question!! causse if it is how sad!=(|`|M4nXH7DTaa	WOW IF YOU DONT KNOW THIS THEN YOU PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE DOING ANYTHING WITH A GUY!!!!! NO YOU CAN'T GET PREGNANT!|`|dCLnLlsCaa	NO!

Of course not|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	No. How do people not know this?|`|AA10478146	no|`|FYDw1rjlaa	If you do not know how a woman get pregnant then you should not being having sex at all. To answer your question, no you cannot get pregnant through your mouth but through vaginally.|`|PYYh0E8Faa	I totally agree if you have to ask this you have no business doing anything sexual for a very long time! <br>  <br>  And its comes IN my mouth not through!|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	How old are you.  Do you not read books?  This is a gross topic and for your question, NO you can't.|`|lHjXeN8oaa	sounds like you should have paid more attention in your health class... shame on you....  maybe spend more time in the books and not playing with boys.|`|AA11542929	oh yeah thats the new way instead of losing ur virginty.. na im dding u cant get pregnant that way..|`|WecTdlZ5aa	wow|`|xXMUyCalaa	no|`|IAlFjGwUaa	no but i would be the guy to do that haha
Kl1h5dCaaa	Your kidding me right??<br>  <br>  We eat off the floor, our food tastes better that way. Seriously if you came to my house, you'd understand. I am CRAZY (we knew that already). My floor is spotless, I clean it every day, sometimes twice, or thrice.<br>  I have toddlers, and babies. They still eat their toys, so like it matters if their food touches the ground.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	It adds flavor!<br>  <br>  Most of the time the dog gets it first, we have anew puppy that eats everything!|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I usually don't let him. He's 6 and I'll say something more to teach him good habits than actually worrying about him getting sick.<br>  <br>  If I do let him pick up food off the floor and eat it, it has to be the floor in my house and nothing sticky or anything. And in that case, I pretend I don't see him put it in his mouth.|`|szvL591iaa	5 second rule.|`|AA10745377	5 second rule|`|DNygQdmVaa	if it was a clean floor and just for a second then yes i would.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	if its my floor then yes the 5 second rule any other place heck no|`|AA12145826	First I need to know:<br>  <br>  1) What fell?<br>  2) Where did it fall?<br>  3) Will it be easily cleaned with water?<br>  4) How long had it been there before being discovered?|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	depends on what it is really|`|WirFwirLaa	I'm bad about feeding my little boy in his highchair and then getting him down and laughing hysterically as he looks like a little vulture eating his droppings off the floor! I know I should probably stop him but it's so funny!|`|AA10285288	I don't personally. I am kind of a germaphobe, though.<br>  <br>  My kids are 14 and 7. So they may do it without me knowing. But, they would probably never tell me if they did.|`|s7PMlWSUaa	Yes I do let them eat stuff off the floor i clean it everyday and keep my kitchen REALLY clean also kids should be free to eat off the floor if thats what they want to do|`|5gKg5S0vaa	I'm all for the 5 second rule! Personally I think our society has become far too sanitised, children need to be exposed to a certain amount of germs so that their bodies can develop immunity :oD|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	heck yes..god made dirt and dirt doesn't hurt. unless it is the bathroom floor, near the cat bowls or anywhere on my 17 year old stepson's person or room.|`|3LvlXDOAaa	my mother let me do it and i've got an amazing immune system. (obviously she didn't let me pick up just anything off any floor) it does no harm!|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Not if I get to it first.|`|VHaSKFC2aa	From the age of 3 and below you shouldnt let them eat anything that is undercooked or that fell on the floor, their immune system may not be able to handle it yet. <br>  At about 5 and above then its not so bad, but only if its not something that's sticky. A sucker you can wash the dirt off, but gum is a no. A cookie is fine, but spagetti is no. A chip is fine but a gummie bear is no. <br>  Also, if it fell somewhere animals poop, in the bathroom, on a place where raw food was prepared or in a shared pool/lake then its a no. To much bacteria live in those places. <br>  <br>  Kids get dirty! They suck on their thumbs after they've touched a ball another kid just sneezed on! Kids like to eat sand. Kids like to lick strange things. It happens. It's what being a kid is about. :)|`|tZES73R0aa	It depends on where it is.  If it's something sloppy I won't let them eat it.|`|AA10478146	I usually let him eat it if it falls on the floor.  I keep my floors pretty clean.|`|WvUfRWC1aa	5 second rule just playing around<br>  it all depends on were and wat|`|1os95dHZaa	My dog is like a bolt of lighting when she hears something hit the floor, my daughter doesn't stand a chance at getting it back. If for some reason the dog is not around then she throws it away, I have more or can get her something else! <br>  If it lands on herself or the table then she is welcome to eat it, but not the floor!<br>  My daughter is 4|`|8PoRICBiaa	HELL NO! i dun have kidz but when i do, i wont let em eat whats on da floor, they aint no dogs!!|`|CsBvnpkSaa	Yes and No:<br>  <br>  <br>  The 5 second rule always applies, but it depends on how delicious the food is, the more tasty the food, the longer the seconds of rule. for example:<br>  <br>  A chip: 5 second rule<br>  <br>  A slice of pizza: 7.5 second rule<br>  <br>  A piece of steak: 15 seconds rule<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  etc. etc. etc :) hope this helped|`|3804c41362b69be635d5ce9b2c2404d3aa	5 second rule applies unless we are in a hospital, restroom, or animal barn.  I think that overprotecting your child from simple things like a little dirt from the floor makes him or her have a very weak immune system. My son is 3 and he is usually dirtier than the floor actually is! (Even though we are wiping his face and washing his hands dozens of times a day!)|`|uPEPjabqaa	Not that big of a deal. I actually watched this show on the discovery channel, i believe, where there were doctors talking about the '5 second rule' saying that your food will not get infected that fast. It's safe for a while. I wouldn't worry about it.|`|aPuefPuFaa	nope, germs are germs.|`|ajbMVt8maa	i never let my 6 year old son eat something that has fallen on the floor... It's gross anyway, but even worse since we have 3 dogs.<br>  i don't think the food lasts for a second on the floor, anyway. one of the pooches is always "hovering" when we eat ;)|`|2RhTe54Raa	no|`|WcsYK6sYaa	i kno im not a parent but my mom let me eat food off the floor but she was a neat freak so the floor was always spotless (5 sec rule) and think think thats partly way i have a very storng immune system i hardly ever get sick.|`|QhrUERADaa	Well,<br>  yeah, i let my kids eat off the floor all the time.<br>  <br>  i mean, do they actually expect the food to be ON the table?<br>  <br>  where else BUT the floor?<br>  <br>  the real question is, who DOESN'T eat off the floor?|`|iHJuXKBiaa	I'm with Charli, I clean constantly. And why should I worry about germs from the floor, when the kids always bring a virus home from school. What doesn't kill them makes them stronger.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a 2.5 and a 5 yr old.|`|MXMGd0Xaaa	it depends on what it is.<br>  (im 17)<br>  if its liquidy then no, if its like popcorn or a chip yes. and no more that like 6 seconds, if my dogs dont eat it.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Depends what it is<br>  where it is<br>  how long been there<br>  how clean the floor|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Well my son eats anything he can sneak by us. Of course at this stage he isn't really eating, just putting it in his mouth. When he gets old enough to actually try eating food that has been dropped it will depend on the food and how long ago it fell. A few seconds for a carrot stick I will probably be ok with. But cheese would never be acceptable because every speck of dirt will stick to that cheese in just a few seconds.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	well, yogurt, no.  a cookie, sure.  actually, more likely i'd have them give it to me and i'd eat it.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Throw it out. 7 and 16. I used to be different but as they get older things change.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	depends on where she drops it. like if the floor is pretty clean or its the carpet. I let her eat it. its hard to get that one damn cherrio away from a 14 mo old without tears or protest. Plus i think a little dirt is good. She needs to be exposed to a little bit of germs you know. if she were to drop it outside or where ppl walk with shoes, then no she cant have it|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my first born.  never!  how could i let the precious little angel eat off the dirty wirty floor.<br>  <br>  now with the second - he slurps juice he has dumped on the floor off the floor.  eh if doesn't have hair in it, its fine.|`|TQW5E6olaa	At my home or in my car, if it's dry food (cracker/cookie/raisin/etc) that has fallen, she can eat it.|`|ZyXTngiCaa	9/10 times my canine pack gets it first..lol. I'm pretty mellow though. I gave up stressing out about stuff like that long ago. 5 second rule works for me.|`|um29wkUPaa	It's not the floor it's all the doghair on it.  No matter how many times a day I vaccuum, it's always covered.  <br>  <br>  Refer to my "why bother" floor washing question a week or so back.<br>  <br>  So anytime they drop something on the floor, it's out.  Which is fine with the dogs.  Their rule is, if they can reach it, they can eat it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Depends on what it is, and if i've recently cleaned the floors or not as well...<br>  <br>  Cookie, any thing that "hard foo" -mom cleaned floor earlier..OK<br>             mom hasn't cleaned floor in couple days...NO WAY<br>  <br>  chicken, steak, chops, etc- NO WAY...unless it's a whole big piece i've just dropped on my own, and i've just cleaned the floors that day..and it's not on the carpet! I'll clean it off with water and commence to cutting! Meat is too expensive sometimes to just throw away!<br>  <br>  7, 3, and 1|`|Btsctjydaa	Use the 3-second rule. It takes germs 4 seconds to jump on food.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	I was against when I ha dthe first baby, then there was two, 3, etc.<br>  After that i figured hey they were lucky they got food! Okay, so I didn't really mean the last part but germs are every where.<br>  If it fell for a minute it would depend on what food it was.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	no|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I follow the 5 second rule. Olivia is 14 months and Paige is 8 years. Of course Olivia has a way of finding the littlest crumb from who knows what corner and sticks it in her mouth before I can stop her|`|snUDfcfgaa	Nothing drops on the floor because if anything falls, the dog already has it in her mouth.
S1gJJHNzaa	everyone is different but mine stays high 3-4 days most cycles.  you really should be using ovulation tests though because cervical position alone just isn't good enough to determine when you will O..<br>  these are the best and cheapest I have found, you can get 10 pregnancy tests and 30 ovulation tests for $20  <a href="http://www.babycreation.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycreation.com</a>  good luck and God Bless!|`|9osFXKPyaa	I KNOW WHEN IT IS HIGH AND SOFT IT MEAN YOU ARE FERTILE BUT I AM NOT REALLY SURE HOW LONG IT STAY LIKE THAT.

930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	The meds cause diarrhea, I'd bet money that's what it's from. <br>  <br>  As for his cough, let him suck on things like freezies, frozen yogurt tubes, suckers if you allow them. Anything to keep him swallowing. With strep it's a dry sticky feeling in your throat that makes you cough...well for me anyways. <br>  Even a neverending cup of water will help.|`|p8WE47xIaa	Did his meds come with information about it?  If it did it should have side affects that can come from taking the meds.  If you did not get info. or you have miss placed it.  Then you can google the meds.  I have done this many times.  If he is taking an antibiotic.  Then I can almost guess that is what is causing the diarrhea.  If the diarrhea gets bad, then call his doctor to see if you can give him Children's Imodium AD.<br>  <br>  For the cough.  You can give him herbal tea with honey and lemon in it.  In his sippy cup.  It don't have to be hot, but it is better warm.  My son has had strep 2 times.  I know that it is not fun to see your baby sick.  I hope that he gets well soon.

Congrats, good luck & God Bless!!!|`|5iOHJHUzaa	I agree with the other girl. Please do not give your child two names! On paperwork, there is only space for one middle name and it will just get confusing. <br>  <br>  That said, Brandt Christopher Sauve is a great name just drop the Michael, it's been done SO MANY times. <br>  <br>  And Jolie Marie Sauve is nice too. Piper isn't really something you want to name your daughter, she will get teased about it because it's silly. Good luck and congrats!|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I hate when people give their children 2 middle names. Why?

1S7uXsInaa	We did books and coloring, but we also played games. . .the car is a great place for this;  I spy is a good one for this.  A game I made up was what we call "The Alphabet Game".  We start with the letter "A" anmd we each have to come up with a word that starts with that letter until we get to "Z".  When she got a little better we would make the words we could use more specific;  like animals, clothing, etc.|`|VHHis05Naa	We used books, crayons, clothing and other things around us to teach her colors.  For shapes we picked up a great book and shape puzzles to help us out.  The key is repetition.  Do it every day, but quit when your child is bored.  <br>  <br>  When you take walks, point out things like birds, flowers, etc and ask what color they are.  Even if they don't answer, just say it's a pretty BLUE flower! That kind of thing.|`|AA10700407	repetition.  use anything and everything.  point out colors in everything you see.  there are all kinds of books.  go to the public library.  we had blocks in the shapes of letters and numbers and magnetic letters and numbers my kids played with.  buy a box of 8 fat crayons and talk about the name of the color as you use it.  blank paper is enough to start with.  these sites can help, too.|`|AA11327039	We talk about the colors of the road signs when we are driving and the shapes of the road sign. ...."Ohhh, look at the Yield sign. It's the shape of a triangle, it's red and white!" or "Ohhh, look at the street sign, it says Main Street, and it's green and white...it's in the shape of a rectangle"<br>  <br>  We also talk about the food we eat.  "Look at those peas, they are round and green, what other foods do you eat that's green?  How many peas do you have on your plate"<br>  <br>  We count the stairs everywhere we go as we walk up and down them. We count the buttons on her shirt. When I wash her hair, we count how many cups of water it takes to fully rinse her hair out"<br>  <br>  Books that teach stuff like that might be helpful but the best tool is your surroundings.  Take a walk and count things, talk about the color of things you find and the texture, and shape, etc.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	We read book and when theres parts in it about counting or shapes or colors then we go over them a few times. Toddlers are like sponges, they absorb everything that they learn. My toddler knows so much that I didn't even realize he was learning just from us reading together. He also watches dora and diego and they have alot of educational stuff on there that he really picks up. Plus he knows some spanish! lol|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I just pointe out things in the room.  Red things, and put the red things near each other.  And a red crayon or marker.  Same with blue, etc.  For shapes, use my hand to go around each shape while repeating what the shape is.<br>  <br>  Children learn thru repetition, and by seeing the items.  And remember that a child's attention span is short.  Don't spend more that 5 minutes at a time on these activities.|`|hYQTOabRaa	While playing with my daughter I observe what she is interested in and then capitalize on that.  <br>  <br>  We haven't been able to afford the best and newest learning toys, so I have taken advantage of every oppurtunity to use her environment to teach her things.  <br>  <br>  By doing this my 20 month old has <br>  <br>  an extensive vocabulary, <br>  <br>  knows all her body parts including cheeks, chin, knee and elbow, <br>  <br>  can say every letter well except 'L' and 'X' and recognizes a few, <br>  <br>  can say every number from 0 - 9 and recognizes a few and <br>  <br>  can count to 2 and is close to counting to 3<br>  <br>  Ever sense she was a baby she has been drawn to the color yellow.  It was the first color she could say and recognize.  She hasn't been very interested in other colors, but i just got her playdough and now her interest is perking.  <br>  <br>  She is also starting to be interested in shapes.<br>  <br>  Note: don't be worried when as she/he learns new concepts, she/he temporarily 'forgets' things she already knows.  This is normal.  The information is not lost, it's just temperarily tucked away while her brain is busy learning something new.|`|e61e7ba9b1b331d84bd4dc421a421d1aaa	I don't force anything with her. I try to use "real life" to teach her...pointing out shapes, colors, numbers, and words that are meaningful to her (to create motivation for her to learn) from her own world. For example, I will point out what color the neighbor's dog is, what sound a dog makes, etc. When she plays with a doll, we point out the colors, where the doll's nose is, etc. There are lots of cool toys out there that require them to put shapes into the right hole in the container. Those are good for learning shapes. My daughter learned how to count to 3 because I always give her two chances before she goes to time out and on the 3rd count she goes to time out. Now she counts with me! Good luck.|`|wHOQXToHaa	A little unconventional, but I went & bought tiny cans of bright colored paint then painted shapes all around my son's room on his walls. He LOVES running over to them and pointing- that's how he's learned all his shapes. Now he runs over & says the names of them all. For counting I just line up his cars, or his balls, or whatever else & count them- I also incorporate Sesame Street videos into his TV time because he has learned his numbers from them. We did buy flashcards (NOT to drill him with!) but when he finds them laying around and pulls them out that is just another opportunity to say look- THREE ducks- 1 2 3! He loves it and can almost count to 10 not- he will be 2 in 2 more months. Same w/colors, when we play with toys I always say- here's your GREEN car, let's get your RED blanket, what color is that train? It's BLUE!|`|0uoYK4vHaa	I used Books and songs and even on the cartoons she watches helps. My daughter is 23 months and can sing the alphabet, count a bit, she know some colors and her shapes.  I am not hounding her to learn them, I just simply read to her often and get her to repeat after me.
cAtWxJG1aa	the best way to learn is from exposure to someone who speaks it to them constantly.  barring that, my kids and i are using Rosetta Stone together to pick up some German for an upcoming trip, and we're all having a blast with it.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	just speak various words in day to day life.

AA10713742	The only way to truly know if she is pregnant is to just take the test. <br>  <br>  When a condom rips, it's sometimes hard to detect. You should always check it when you're done.<br>  <br>  You should check if there are any other symptoms like being extremely tired/moody/or slight body changes.|`|8gCe3vRDaa	it can also be stress and other harmones. Take a test to be sure.|`|xXMUyCalaa	take the test ASAP lol and bein a week late honestly dont mean nothing dont get to worked up seriously us girls are funny with periods and stuff
IOp3knBjaa	Unfortunately condoms are not 100%. There are other possible reasons of why her period is late, however, if there was sex involved it is best to get a test just to be sure. You have heard right though, pregnancy tests are not always accurate, but you definitely wanna try one in this case. Now if she takes the test and it comes up negative and her period still does not come in say a week, then she needs to see a doctor so they can find out what is going on. Best of luck!|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	If you used a condom then most definitely not ... if the condom would have busted and anything would have gotten inside of her she and you would know ... b/c it all comes back out!  And when a condom busts ... its busts open wide ... you would have known pulling it off.  My period is always late ... last month it was 3 weeks late!  No worries I am sure she is okay!|`|7xit1ogxaa	Yes, she is pregnant. Yahoo! answers is more reliable than a pregnancy test. Even if the condom was used correctly there is a small chance she could be pregnant. No birth control is 100% effective.
jjFCyuh2aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  I have a 13 month old so I am no pro, but I am teaching my daughter everything I can and have been for a long time - I have lots of bright posters in her room with colors and shapes and the alaphabet. I also count with her every day - even though she maybe doesn't always seem very interested.  <br>  <br>  I also have a tub of alphabet letters for the bath - they stick to the bathtub and i think they are a fun way to introduce letters and eventually words.<br>  <br>  I just think the more you talk to them the better.<br>  <br>  Lynne|`|AA10700407	give him time.  he should begin to tell them apart soon.|`|AA11701131	My daughter is 17 months and is learning her colors.

I am also trying to get her to sleep on her own.|`|zATQaiwIaa	so your daughters had their own room, the 3 year old had a tv and a huge bed - and then you moved them in one room and no big bed and im not sure about the tv.....and you expected it to go smoothly?<br>  <br>  Your daughter may have gotten used to the "empty noise" of having the tv on when she went to sleep - she may need it now as a background noise.  the bed is also an issue - our 4 year old was given a bunk bed with a double on the bottom after having a toddler bed - she uses the whole bed while she sleeps and i know she will never be able to go back to a smaller bed.  You changed a lot about a space that should be comforting to your daughter - ask her what she needs to feel comfortable to sleep in her own bed all night and explain that mommy and daddys bed is just not strong enough to keep holding all of you......<br>  You are going to have some rough nights of transition - but do NOT let her back in your bed - you only hurt all the progress you make.|`|KmC0K59taa	Have you tried putting a TV in her room and keeping it on like you did?  It's hard to say what is making her wake up and keeping her from calming down to go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  Do you try lying down on her bed with her still she falls asleep?  Try it if you haven't.  I have a 22 month old who wakes up about every night too.  She ends up in our bed!|`|oiJITSNZaa	Do not let your children in your bed that first time or you will ever after regret it. Can you shut the door or put up a gate so she cannot come to your room? You must teach her that she cannot keep waking up during the night. My 3 month old sleeps all night not to mention my other two also. It takes time but when they learn that waking up doesn't get them anywhere they learn to sleep instead.
wb781QEzaa	I would see the doctor, the baby or placenta could be lying real low causing the uncomfortableness and as far as the discharge it could be an infection and that could also cause you to be uncomfortable.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	The baby could be on a nerve, you may want to check with the doctor.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	your expanding blood supply is what causes varicose veins nosebleeds and hemorrhoids at this stage in pregnancy. What causes those symptoms is the expanding blood increases and causes your blood vessels to expand. there are blood vessels in your vagina and those may be inflamed/swollen making you have the sensation of something being in there. I have read that this is normal but call your dr and find out if there is anything that you can do for the discomfort- I have not had this but maybe a cold compress would cause the swelling to go down.|`|AnySJC81aa	I'm not trying to scare you or anything but it could be that you have a vaginal infection. Especially since you are having a lot of discharge. I would call the doctor ASAP and find out what's going on. An untreated infection could harm the baby. Good luck and I hope everything turns out okay!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Yellow? Usually they say if your discharge is not a clear or milky color that something can be wrong? But then again I read that in pregnancy yellow discharge can be normal unless accompanied by other pains. Maybe you should ask your doctor and he can check it out?|`|Rpg8Feg2aa	That happened to me to I think but Im not sure why though.LoL.Just remember that you have a human being growing inside you so weird things are going to happen.My mom always tells me that.LoL.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS   :)

Make sure to take the test in the am because your urine will have more hcg then.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	If it is just pink and not red, then it could be implantation spotting.  Going to 15 dpo, and lasting as long as it did is not common, but does happen.  Since you are a day late I would take a test, it could just be your period starting really slow, or it could be pregnancy related.

AA10636233	Do a search for "the silent scream", they will give you all the gruesome details you are looking for and more. I also read an article recently about a woman in California who went to have a late term abortion, and they gave her drugs and left her alone on a chair to wait for the drugs to work. She delivered alone in the room, but when the clinic worker came in, she shoved the Live baby off the chair onto the floor then stuffed it in a red bio hazard bag and left the room. They found out that the clinic poured lime into the bag to speed the decomp of the baby they had suffocated to death! It was tossed on the roof, but when the police searched there the workers had already removed it. An anonymous tip had them look in a closet in one of the exam rooms a few days later. That is where they found the baby's remains. Talk about one devastated mother, she was under the impression that it was still just a clump of cells like they told her! She had no idea that the baby would be born alive, or that it could have sustained life on its own outside of her body! Just goes to show that you should do your research before doing something so drastic and permanent! They still have not pressed charges against the clinic workers. There were no doctors present at the clinic that day, but no one told the women who went in for the abortions that!|`|bGRexKPyaa	If its the suction cup kind...They give you a shot to open and loosen the cervix then put some type of acid to burn the baby and to make the inoccent baby into pieces...Then they stick this tube inside and suck it allll out...I think its really F*#ked up<br>  <br>  This woman went in to get an abortion and it didnt properly work right, The baby was born and had bright pink and red SCAREING all of her body and she was blinded from the acid....She is now around the age idk 30 and is married with 2 kids and has partial vision and is going to have surgery to be able to see completly|`|YiDhb60Paa	<a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&q=abortion&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wv#" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...</a>|`|OeK9tsh6aa	DO YOU THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TO HAVE ABORTION'S REALLY WANT TO ANSWER THAT???!!!!

The heartbeat is usually detectable with the doppler when you are around 12 weeks. Before that you would need to see and hear it via ultrasound. Your doctor is just doing what is normal. It is frustrating in the beginning because it takes awhile for everything to happen. You just have to try to be patient because there isn't much to see yet.

Then I didn't have another ultrasound until my 20 week checkup and I will have my last one at 38 Weeks I think.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	I live in the US and I got my first at 6 weeks 4 days and I saw the heartbeat & then I heard the heartbeat at my 12 week prenatal appointment and I am going to my next ultrasound at 18 weeks.|`|HxWh88soaa	one at 8 weeks for confirmation of heartbeat and one at 20 weeks|`|bGRexKPyaa	6 weeks.<br>  8 weeks<br>  12 weeks.<br>  <br>  Same pregnancy, I was in the hospital for spotting...The wait was horrrrrrible...|`|mAxChwHTaa	i had mine when i was like 6 weeks... then at 18 to find out if its a boy or a girl then at 30 weeks to check on the baby... it really depends on your doc
p8WE47xIaa	Put an old shower curtain under where he sits.  That way it is easier to clean it up.  When it is time to clean it up.  Have him help you.  Then he will see that it is not fun for mommy to clean up messes.  It may take a few times, but it works.  I did this to my son.  He does not spill anything.  Unless its an accident.  When that happens he helps me cleans it up, and I don't even have to ask him to.  Hes 4 now.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	It can be a game to children that age it's funny when you pick it up. It's also something they just do because they don't know they shouldn't. I use a plastic mat made especially for under a highchair. It's pretty much just like a vinyl table cloth and then I throw it in the wash every few days. I can pick it up and store it when we have company but I also dont have to clean around the messy man in our house (10 months) everyday.|`|7KkTel7Oaa	sometimes, this age, throwing food IS intentional, just to see what you're gonna do. What I've done is cut a big black trashbag open and put it under the high chair. that way, he flings his food, yet you have sanity. Then, when feeding time is over, fold over the edges of the garbage bag, throw it away and viola, clean floor.|`|AA11520118	Good question. I gave you a star because I wonder the same thing--even though I am on my second baby now! For my first, I kept a steam cleaner on hand, and he STILL wrecked more than I can believe. Now my second baby is going through the same phase and I am wondering how much more of my house is going to be destroyed. Good to know I'm not the only one out there, LOL. I guess you could look into some spray-on ScotchGuard, but really, invest in a handheld steam cleaner!|`|TXIyz7JQaa	Pick up a few vinyl table cloths and put them under his chair.  You can just throw them in the washer when they get really nasty.<br>  <br>  It is intentional but it is about learning.  He wants to know what happens when he does that.  He is also motivated by your reaction but don't try to stop him.  He is learning cause and effect.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	We set an old plastic shower curtain on the floor to help protect our rug during meal times.<br>  <br>  You can tell him firmly that we do NOT throw food.  He needs to know that.  He will learn sooner if you point out to him that it is not acceptable.<br>  <br>  It is very important for a child to learn that there are household rules that he is expected to follow.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Keep him in the kitchen for all meals. No food elsewhere in the house. Roll up the rug and put it away for a while. He is still learning but at some point he will also learn how to push your buttons. It's a fine line! Babies are messy.
uNGJnEvqaa	It can mean that it is getting closer to the time of ovulation--but it also depends if you did it at the same time you did before and how much fluids are in your system!!!<br>  Believe me you will def. know when you are ovulating--b/c the line will be as dark as it can get!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|miOor5SRaa	Yes, your hormones are getting higher every day you get closer to ovulation. The OPK detects your LH surge which is said to take place 24-36 hours before you ovulate so being his lil guys can survive in you for several days i would start doing the BD everyday now!|`|sHk1Tdmqaa	Also keep in mind that your surge can happen quickly so if you got an almost dark line I would test twice a day like at 10 am and in the evening.  I missed mine the first go around because of that.  I also chart my temps to verify ovulation, just in case a surge happens with no O.  Good luck and baby dust!
23f57423555eae0d6e25b05d36ef73e8aa	Only you can answer this question for your self. Talk to your parents and the fathers parents (only after you are sure u are preggo!!!) and ask what they think. If you are in a family where they do not belive in abortion than by all meens consider adoption.<br>  <br>  my cousin had a baby when she was 14 and she graduated and is now a mother of  2 at age 18. Having a baby young is hard but is possible if you are motivated to go down that route.<br>  <br>  I had my baby at 19 and it is even hard now but like i said it is a really hard thing to do. i work full time go to colege part time and am a full time mother. i never have time for my self.|`|DfABElERaa	Be mature and take responsibility for your actions, keep the baby and give it up for adoption.<br>  Some women aren't lucky enough to be able to have kids.|`|8jBGhsWPaa	I would get rid of the baby. I dont want to bring a child into the world when I'm still a child myself, plus its a very bad way to concieve a baby with a drunken one night stand.When I have a baby it will be with someone I'm in love with and It will mean to happen|`|SNh8HUWmaa	if you want to keep the baby then do.  your family will get over it, and be a support to you.  never mind what your school thinks.  if you feel that strongly about keeping the baby, you'll never forgive yourself if you abort.  parenthood is a tough, tiring road to travel - but it's worth it.|`|AA11604319	Adoption is a much better alternative than terminating the pregnancy.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Put the baby up for adoption & be more responsible.|`|758cDKEFaa	i was 15 and my boyfriend was 14 when we found out we were having a baby (planned).<br>  i had my friend come from a different lesson tell me that people were saying if i keep my baby im ruingin my life and if i have an abortion im sly.<br>  i turned around and said its none of there business! i love my baby, im keeping my baby and its not gunno ruin my life!<br>  since ive had my baby its only made my life better.<br>  my son is now 17 months old and im 17 weeks and 4 days with my second (same dad to my first - been together 3 years) and still couldnt give a toss what my friends think and my family dont look down on me in anyway, they think im brave for going through this at such a young age.<br>  after i had my son my dad sat down next to me while i was watching my little boy sleep and told me how proud he was of me.|`|POGZZmoUaa	If you are pregnant, under the circumstances, carry the pregnancy and let a loving family adopt the child.  There is no reason to terminate a precious little life over your mistakes.|`|3w7VztEWaa	I don't drink anymore.......or party.<br>  so I guess that wouldn't happen to me.|`|LjzlgS0Iaa	keep. I could never abort a child, whether I was ready for one or not. I don't think I could live with myself afterwards.|`|eGM2mzePaa	keep it its not the babys fault how it was conceived|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Let's find out if you're pregnant first.  Don't jump the gun.|`|YWfeRt41aa	yes, not ready, not the right person|`|joPJtKemaa	Stay in school and learn how to speak and write in proper English!!!!!!!!!|`|7i0r7DZoaa	I would say keep the baby, but if you are really not ready to look after the baby put it up for adoption! But please make sure that you and the father keep in touch with the adoptive parents, because I would not like to be a child who doesn't know who my actuall parents are. See the baby lots, so when you do meet it wont be akward (at least once a week)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and if you are expecting, good luck, but keep in touch with the innocent child please, and make sure they have a good life!|`|3vGANWX6aa	You lot have no idea. She's not an idiot,remember when you drunk you dont know what your doing, its not like she planned on having sex with this guy and getting pregnant. If you were in her position, im sure you wouldnt like these comments being said to you, so keep it to yourself, this girl needs nothing but support.<br>  Im just going to wish you good luck, your friends will help you through and your family will be there i know they will.<br>  All my love darling<3|`|bGRexKPyaa	Well you guys made an adult decision so I think its right to do the adult thing and keep the inoccent little baby.<br>  <br>  Its going to be harder but its life, You'll have family to support you..<br>  <br>  They'll love the baby right when its in there arms:]]|`|OPq2RQeCaa	Hun simple if your against abortion then that's not an option. Never go against your beliefs to please someone else. If YOU honestly feel you're not ready then go for an adoption. Whatever you do, do it because you want to, not someone else|`|gYDIL3Ipaa	baby get an abortion! and people saying adoption, dude are you crazy? keep a baby for 9 months and give it up.. naaaa! lol do what you feel is right for you but think it may not be just your life your messin up..|`|DDxPjZCpaa	This is your child, flesh and blood. This baby is apart of you and will always love you and depend on you. That kind of feeling is worth living for. I would choose to keep.|`|Rpg8Feg2aa	Keep and if you can't take care of the baby and or you dont want to then look into adoption.<br>  <br>  God Luck<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS   :)|`|O3MfNNCyaa	of course you're not mature enough to raise a baby but NEVER get rid of a baby, remember adoption is an option too...|`|JreuGwJYaa	put the baby up for adoption not abortion its not the babys fault your an idiot!|`|eXg0ozLnaa	If its not too late you could take the morning after pill|`|Ri2I8Ofuaa	hey =) i was just wundering how old u are?? xx
bFfWFsFWaa	Absolutely not. You deny the child the right to live just because it's going to be a bit special? There are ways to help the child through life, and you both should love the kid regardless. Is it a matter of not wanting to take care of the kid? Then I suggest putting it up for adoption and tieing your wife's tubes. But if you're truely concerned with the child...give him/her the right to live. <br>  The bottom line is...<br>  <br>   I think the child would want to have the chance to live, even with the struggles it will encounter...and experience the love and good things life has to offer.  It may be hard at times but worth it. And don't worry. I've known parents who have been in your situation. It's hard to think about it now, but when the child is brought to this earth, you'll be glad for makeing the decision to let it live.|`|AA11604319	No, she should not have an abortion!  Shame on you for even suggesting such a thing.  You and your wife will love this child and will deal with any problems that come along with Cri Du Chat Syndrome.  it could be a lot worse.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your upcoming birth!|`|YFPMcHCbaa	It's really only up to you guys. Posting a question like this is bound to get a thousand different opinions on abortion.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	hey jeff!|`|xc8bnpCvaa	I would think NO, the child will be born with difficulties, but this is your CHILD!  From what I read, the syndrome is one that will take effort, but is not unmanageable. I can't even imagine that your wife would even consider that as an option. <br>  Site with some information and links to support:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001593.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...</a>|`|LN3LMIm1aa	I would say no. You never know what difference your child could make in this world. Seriously! He was made for a divine purpose. My brother was born with Spinal Bifida. Immediately after his birth they discovered he had a brain infection. They had to put plates in his skull, and tubes to drain the fluid building up in his brain (which are there to this day). They didn't know if he was going to be brain dead. My mother was told by the doctors that he would never walk. She was told that he probably wouldn't live past a month. My brother is still alive today...against all odds. He can walk.He is a college graduate. I see him as no different than anyone else. I am not comparing Cri-Du-Chat Syndrome to Spinal Bifida, I am merely stating that miracles happen every day. We all have our own handicaps. Don't give up on your baby! God doesn't allow anything to be put on us that we can't bare.Trust in someone who is bigger than you and your situation. All things are possible with Jesus Christ! God bless you and your family!!!|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	NO!!! God made that child special, and there are so many services for children with special needs.  If you think you cannot handle the situation then seek adoption.  There are people out there who would love to adopt a special needs child.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Yes..  Without a doubt.  The baby will suffer its whole life and so will you and your wife.  It is unfair and selfish to you and the baby to keep it a live just so you can have a kid.|`|Xjki14AXaa	NO.  Keep the precious baby!|`|5fWcql37aa	No.|`|yKS2UI87aa	No. All children are perfect in God's eyes.|`|hTwuSiN9aa	NO! You might think it's the right thing to do now but you'll regret it later. trust me.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	that is a decision u and ur wife will have to make... a very VERY HARD decisions. if u feel u can handel this and are financially stable and can meet the needs of a child with special needs then why not... but also keep in mind this is ur wife's body and in the end it is her decision ur not the one carrying the baby and if she feels like an abortion would be to much for her then u need to respect that <br>  best of luck with what ever happens|`|7xit1ogxaa	No
Wd7ujHNhaa	miscarriages are very common.  They say that it is estimated that every sexually active woman has a miscarriage at some point during their lifetime.  Most miscarriages happen before the woman even knows that they are pregnant and usually never know that they had a miscarriage.  After you find out that you are pregnant, the chance of miscarriage drops some, and when you pass the 12 week mark of your pregnancy the risk of miscarriage dramatically decreases.  I don't believe that just because your family members had miscarriages you are doomed to have one.  So, relax, you have the same chances as any other woman has!!|`|QtWtzZ6Baa	yes
QFNvYVtyaa	During the beginning of the cycle, the menstrual bleeding, the cervix is normally low and hard and slightly open to allow the blood flow out. It feels like the tip of your nose. I normally don’t check it during menstruation, simply because of the mess. After the bleeding stops the cervix remains low and hard and the os - the opening to the uterus - remains closed. This will change the closer to ovulation you approach. The cervix rises up to the top of the vagina and becomes softer and softer. At the height of ovulation the cervix feels more like your lips than your nose and the os are open to allow sperm to enter in. Sometimes the cervix seems to disappear - which, of course, it has simply become so soft it blends in with the vagina walls and rises so high that the finger cannot touch it. This is known as SHOW - soft, high, open and wet.<br>  <br>  The time frame for this to happen varies from woman to woman. Each woman is unique and must give herself several cycles to determine when events take place. Sometimes ovulation will start to happen and the cervix will rise and soften and then ovulation will be delayed for some reason. I have noticed that my own cervix seems to see-saw at different points - but in acquainting yourself with all your fertile signs - you learn how to recognize each one of them. <br>  <br>  Once ovulation occurs the cervix drops to low and firm - once again feeling like the tip of your nose. And the os become tightly closed. (The os in a woman who has given birth vaginally will feel more open at all times because of the stretching that occurred at the birth of her baby.) This can happen right away after ovulation to several hours to several days. Again, each woman is unique and needs to find these things out over a several month time frame. <br>  <br>  When pregnancy occurs, the cervix will rise up and become soft, yet the os will remain tightly closed. This occurs at different times in different women. Some women may find that twelve days after ovulation their cervix will do this and is a probable pregnancy sign. Others won’t experience this until well after the pregnancy has been confirmed.<br>  <br>  When checking the cervix - use caution - always clean your hands and try not to do this too often - the cervix can sometimes become easily irritated. If you don’t feel comfortable charting this sign, then don’t do it. And give yourself a month or two to acquaint yourself with the different changes the cervix goes through during the cycle.|`|QtWtzZ6Baa	uah u could be pregnant

Good luck|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	take a test|`|QFNvYVtyaa	Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy; however, one of the most significant pregnancy symptoms is a delayed or missed menstrual cycle. Understanding the signs and symptoms of pregnancy is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience signs or symptoms of pregnancy within a week of conception. For other women, pregnancy symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy signs symptoms. If you have been sexually active and experiencing any of the following symptoms it is important to take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.<br>  <br>  <br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.<br>  <br>  Swollen/Tender Breasts:<br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.<br>  <br>  Fatigue/Tiredness:<br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.<br>  <br>  Nausea/Morning Sickness:<br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.<br>  <br>  Backaches:<br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.<br>  <br>  Headaches:<br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.<br>  <br>  Frequent Urination:<br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.<br>  <br>  Darkening of Areolas:<br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Food Cravings:<br>  <br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Other Explanations: Poor diet, lack of a certain nutrient, stress, depression, or impending menstruation|`|b8f0CfSsaa	A dull ache can be a pregnancy symptom in early pregnancy, but try not to get your hopes up too much (which I know is easier said than done). Some experts say that a dull ache is a sign of implantation, however if that is the case with you then you would have implanted very early. Implantation usually occurs over a 6-14 day period after you have conceived, so depending on your average cycle length it sounds unlikely that you have implanted already. This feeling may be due to the fertilised egg travelling through the fallopian tubes.|`|AA10713742	I know this may sound weird but I think I know the exact moment I knew I was pregnant. My stomach was having this really strong pain and the only way I could stop it, is if I laid on my side. It was extremely painful and I couldn't even breath.<br>  <br>  Most women are different but after that pain, a few weeks later, I discovered I was pregnant. My appetite change, I was extremely tired, and my breast were huge.<br>  <br>  I hadn't missed my period, but it still came out positive when I took the test...<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  !

However, before you pick a name you should look at what his initials will be (you don't want it to be embarrassing, like if you named him Allistair Samuel Smith = A.S.S.), and also you want to think about any possible nicknames he might be called, and see if you like them (for example, if you name him Edmund, would you mind him being called Ed or Eddy by his friends?).|`|HLKp61i2aa	jujaystin<br>  <br>  gurlybu<br>  <br>  ezekiel<br>  <br>  comkuna<br>  <br>  kuna<br>  <br>  robertha<br>  <br>  shet<br>  <br>  jewel<br>  <br>  box<br>  <br>  nature<br>  <br>  deer<br>  <br>  jacket<br>  <br>  praise<br>  <br>  Awsome <br>  <br>  Argentina|`|CBsfqXCIaa	i like tristan as well, just spell it different, like Trystan or Trystin. looks cool to me

Id get checked asap. I knew something was wrong when the cramping was way worse then normal period cramps, and wouldnt go away for days. I was doubled over in pain. I also noticed that when I did spot it was bright red instead of brownish-red. I was 16 days late, never even knew I was pregnant, I had an ectopic pregnancy, then a miscarriage, really talk to your doctor, preg tests arent always accurate too, make them do an ultrasound, they did a preg test on me it came back neg, then turned positive. Hope everything turns out ok!|`|8LBl7HgAaa	It sounds like a miscarriage. I had very thick tissue when I miscarried. You should try to take a home pregnancy test to see if it shows a +.

373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Aw hun, I know what you mean!<br>  <br>  I was lucky enough to fall pregnant wih my first with out even trying - he was a happy accident. I then realised how beautiful and amazing it is to be pregnant, go through labour and bring up a child - so we decided to go ahead with #2.<br>  <br>  In the 10 months we were trying, we had 3 early miscarriages. I then made it to almost 5 months pregnant, then lost my baby. This was just 4 weeks ago - agonsing!

It's madness.<br>  <br>  My only advice is TRY your best, to calm down about TTC, I know that's so hard though!! I only say this because, I miscarried in Sept 08, I was only 6 weeks pregnant, I decided to give up for a while and chill, Lo and behold... 14 days later...

This is a streesful and difficult time with out all the stress you are outting yourself through. Have his sperm count checked again, so you know better. Relax, stress is very hazardous to conceiving.

This is true and fact, so it makes sense wh ynot everyone becomes preganant when looking at sperm.  WQuit worrying, do your thing, and wait, you will know.

Not everyone feels it.  I can sometimes, but more often I don't.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	I have cramping|`|QFNvYVtyaa	What is Mittelschmerz?<br>  <br>  Mittelschmerz refers to abdominal or pelvic pain that is experienced between periods. The word mittelschmerz actually means "middle pain," because this pain is felt during the middle of your menstrual cycle. Typically occurring around Day 14 of your cycle, mittelschmerz pain coincides with ovulation. The abdominal pain is typically low and one-sided, occurring on the side of the pelvis that you are ovulating from. As many as 1 in 5 women experience mittelschmerz pain every month.<br>  <br>  What Causes Mittelschmerz Pain?<br>  <br>  There is no known cause of mittelschmerz ovulation pain, however, there are a number of theories as to why women experience these mid-cycle cramps. During ovulation, your egg is released from a casing, known as a follicle. When the follicle breaks, it releases fluid and blood. This fluid and blood may actually irritate the lining of your abdomen, causing pain. Mittelschmerz may also be caused by the growth of the ovarian follicle, which can stretch the surface of you ovary, causing pain.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of Mittelschmerz<br>  <br>  Mittelschmerz syndrome symptoms can range in severity from woman to woman. The main symptom of mittelschmerz is lower abdominal pain that occurs on one side. This pain can:<br>  <br>  <br>  be mild to severe <br>  be intermittent or constant <br>  switch from side to side every month <br>  last for a couple of minutes or up to several hours<br>  <br>  Other common symptoms of mittelschmerz include:<br>  <br>  <br>  mild nausea <br>  light vaginal bleeding <br>  headaches<br>  <br>  Diagnosing Mittelschmerz<br>  <br>  Your health care provider can diagnose mittelschmerz fairly easily. If your symptoms are similar to those of mittelschmerz, your health care provider will ask you to monitor your cycle, to find out when you are ovulating. If your symptoms occur during ovulation, it is likely that you are experiencing mittelschmerz. More severe symptoms may be a sign that something else is going on.<br>  <br>  Warning Signs of Possible Complications<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing any abdominal pain or cramping, it is important to keep an eye on your symptoms. If your symptoms escalate, it is a good idea to visit your health care provider in order to rule out any possible complications. Warning signs include:<br>  <br>  <br>  severe cramping or pelvic pain <br>  cramps that last longer than a day <br>  fever <br>  dizziness or fainting <br>  painful urination <br>  swelling of the abdomen <br>  bloody stool or vomit<br>  <br>  Complications of Mittelschmerz<br>  Mittelschmerz pains are very normal, and, on their own, they do not pose any physical risk. However, if your symptoms are severe, you should have your health care provider check you out for any other complications. Your health care provider can perform a pelvic exam or a pelvic ultrasound to make sure that you are not suffering from:<br>  <br>  <br>  appendicitis <br>  endometriosis <br>  ovarian cysts <br>  polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)<br>  <br>  Treating Mittelschmerz Pain<br>  Unless your pain is severe, you likely won't require any treatment for your mittelschmerz pain. Many women do find that over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen help to relieve cramps and related aches and pains.<br>  <br>  If your mittelschmerz cramps are particularly troublesome, you may ask your health care provider about trying a hormonal method of birth control. The birth control pill, the birth control patch, and the birth control ring, all release combinations of hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, to stop ovulation. Once you are no longer ovulating, your mittelschmerz pains should stop.<br>  <br>  Self Treatment for Mittelschmerz Pain<br>  Self treatment is often the best way to alleviate cramps that you experience mid-cycle. Here are some tried and tested ways of getting rid of those aches and pains.<br>  <br>  <br>  Drink Water: Try to drink between six and eight glasses of water every day. Water will help to keep you hydrated, which will alleviate those cramps. <br>  <br>  Use a Heating Pad: Heat helps to soothe cramps. Get an electric heating pad and keep it on your abdomen for 15 minutes or so. <br>  Take a Warm Bath: Fill your tub up with warm water and just relax. The heat of the water will help to relieve any pain.|`|0DquWttZaa	feeling like going to have period soon...if u want to know when do u ovulate then use basal thermometer and ovulation kit these both can be really help u. good luck baby dust.<br>  <br>  .
LN3LMIm1aa	Folic acid, a B vitamin, helps prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord when taken before the end of early pregnancy. It is available in most multivitamins, as a folic acid-only supplement and in some foods. You should begin taking the folic acid a month before conception (but who really knows when conception will take place? lol). Healthy foods, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, are the best sources of vitamins and minerals. But because it is sometimes hard to get all the nutrients we need from foods, all adults should take one multivitamin per day. Folic acid is the biggie though. My pregnancy was unexpected for both my husband and I (over six years of TTC and lot's of prayers...lol). But Glory to God we still had a healthy beautiful baby boy! So you will be alright! God Bless!!|`|nVEBL4ukaa	In my own experience with trying to have my son.... My doctor put me on vitamins and folic acid when I went in to tell him I wanted another child. Within 3 months I was pregnant with my son.  He started me because you have a higher chance of getting pregnant when your body is properly nurished. If you are not treating your body right it may not be the suitable environment for your baby to be healthy.|`|muBb414baa	If you plan on getting pregnant in the near future, I would definitely start taking some prenatal vitamins with folic acid early on.  Folic acid is what helps to develop the babys neural tube (brain matter and spinal cord connection to the brain).  By the time you know you are pregnant, that is already developed.  Its best to start it early so u can prep your baby to be the best possible health..<br>  <br>  Good luck... <br>  <br>  By the way, my doctor prescribed me with Duet DHA Prenatal Vitamins with Folic Acid.  Its one pill.. try it...|`|IeLBIACaaa	prenadal vitamins.  doesnt matter.|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	As soon as you start trying!  I have been on them for 2 months!  Just keep pumping your body with them!!!|`|iZDsMCghaa	If your planning on getting pregnant, start.

Folic acid helps the baby develop there neural tubes. And those start to develop early on in pregnancy even before some woman know that they're pregnant. I think it's a really good idea. My doctor said at least three months. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KaNjj6HBaa	Yes! A good rule of thumb is 2 months prior to conception. That way your body has plenty when your baby is conceived. The best thing to do is to take a prenatal vitamin with folic acid and everything else the baby needs.|`|H9t63i4Kaa	A woman should start taking prenatals, as soon as she decides she wants a baby!!!|`|U12Xuyemaa	Before. But make sure your doctor approves of the vitamin you are taking.

KozoNqpsaa	What you're describing sounds like ovulation CM to me. It doesn't need to be white, it can be clear too. It's more about the consistency than the color.<br>  Good luck!|`|90zcKChJaa	What you are finding, that is what your doctor is talking about. The discharge will be a jelly, egg white consistancy that will stick and stretch if pulled between your fingers. This means that you are in fact ovulating. Have some fun!!!<br>  <br>  Baby dust!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	As ovulation approaches, your cervical mucus (sometimes abbreviated on BBT charts as CM) changes from a consistency not-so-kind to sperm, to a more fertile variety that sperm can survive and swim through better. Right after ovulation, the cervical mucus changes back to the less fertile kind.<br>  <br>  While everyone's body is different, the general changes that cervical mucus go through are dry or sticky, to creamy, to wet, to a raw egg white consistency, and then, back to dry and sticky.<br>  <br>  When your cervical mucus is in the wet or egg white consistency stage, ovulation is approaching. This is the best time to have sex, if you want to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Check Your Cervical Mucus:<br>  <br>  First, wash and dry your hands well.<br>  <br>  Find a comfortable position, either by sitting on the toilet, squatting, or standing up and putting one leg up on the bathtub edge or toilet seat.<br>  <br>  Reach one finger inside your vagina; your index or middle finger is probably best. (Be careful not to scratch yourself.) Depending on how much cervical mucus you're producing, you may not need to reach so far, but getting a sample from near your cervix is ideal.<br>  <br>  Remove your finger from your vagina and observe the consistency of whatever mucus you find. Do this by both looking at the mucus and rolling what you find between two fingers (usually your thumb and index finger). Also, try pressing your fingers together and then slowly moving them apart. <br>  <br>  If what you find seems sticky, or findings are scant, you're probably not ovulating yet. <br>  <br>  If what you find is creamy, ovulation may be coming, but not just yet. <br>  <br>  If what you find is wet, watery, and slightly stretchy, ovulation is very likely close. Find time for some baby-making sex. <br>  <br>  If what you find is very wet, stretches between your fingers for an inch or more, and resembles raw egg white, your cervical mucus is very fertile. Ovulation is right around the corner, and now is the ideal time for intercourse.<br>  <br>  If you are charting your BBT, you should mark down on your chart your cervical mucus findings. Abbreviations often used are S for sticky, C for creamy, W for wet, and EW for egg-white cervical mucus

They feel comfortable talking to me about things since I'm like them and I'm not quite like their parents either (generation gap) - it's amazing what kids will let you in on if there's no fear of judgment or punishment. From them, I've learned how to talk to kids and effectively communicate without them feeling like they're being patronized. Personally, I think feeling like someone's talking down to you is a big part of why kids don't listen to authority. People assume that just because they're kids that they're stupid and it really isn't the case.<br>  And before I was teaching lessons, I was a riding camp counselor every summer, so I have had experience with all ages over 5.

They can be the nicest thing one minute then throw a temper tantrum because they want there way, the next minute they can completely forget and or be confused. It has taught me a lot more patience. <br>  <br>  It has taught me so much patience and to enjoy your life for it can go by way to fast.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	I learned allot about patience. A big one is no matter how planned they are, will not go perfect. Also learned to grin an bear it.<br>  <br>  lol in the LGBT section there's a bunch of people who just select ok and don't notice their questions go in there. It's very funny.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I would have to say babysitting and jobs I've held where there were teenagers working their and also watching bosses deal with situations among staff.  Mostly I'd say I learn more as a parent that helps me in my career then the other way around though.|`|AA12227599	Unless you work with children, I really don't think any jobs teach you anything about being a parent.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Waitress/ Bartending= multi-tasking<br>  <br>  All jobs= patience<br>  <br>  ETA: LMAO at desmeran's gingerbread card in candyland comment!!!!

uVuYdcRcaa	Hi Hun,<br>  <br>   (((BIG HUGS))) First of all, I just wanted to say sorry for your loss. I too have been through a missed miscarriage with my first baby. <br>  <br>   I been through a D&C too - normally your period arrives roughly 5 weeks after the op so I would way that the bleeding is from the operation.<br>  <br>   I think it best to maybe go to the A&E - they won't turn you away hun they will want to help you - if you don't hun then you won't know if there is an infection and it best to get it sorted.<br>  <br>  Darling, I know it scary time and that you want to avoid hospitals at all costs after having this kind of operation but it for your safety. I too was scared but had to go as I had an infection from the operation - bleeding too. Please go hun<br>  <br>   - if you feel you can't do this then ring the NHS Direct on 0845 4647 now as they will advise you on what to do.<br>  <br>  All the best darling<br>  <br>  Lx|`|uX4FDZnvaa	hello.<br>  <br>  It could well be your period.<br>  <br>  The early pregnancy unit told me that a women can have her period within 4-6 weeks.<br>  <br>  If you are worried then see your gp or go to the early pregnancy unit in the hospital when you can.<br>  <br>  Im sure its nothing to worry about but if you do start bleeding so heavy that your filling 2-3 pads in and hour or 2 then i would go to a&e as soon as possible. that is what i have been told.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry for your loss and wish you all the best with future pregnancy's. xXxXxXxXx|`|b3XSnPXBaa	Hi, I just want to say first of all that I'm very sorry for your loss.  I don't know too much about it as I'm only 9 weeks with my first baby, but I would just say pop to the hospital and just ask them, I'm sure it's all very normal, but they will tell you straight away and set your mind at rest.  Take care of yourself and the very best of luck for the future. x|`|xpstigPTaa	Typically it gets lighter as time goes by. I bled for about 2-3 weeks very heavily after my D&C and then it tapered off. Get to the doctors and see what they say. best of luck to you and I'm sorry for your loss.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	I agree with the others. I would call your doctor ASAP. If it is nothing then you can relax but if it is something then they need to know right away. You do not want to hemorrhage. Please call them. It is better to be safe than sorry|`|zlciavc1aa	You may want to call or visit your doctor. It's supposed to get lighter not heavier.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Please call your doctor. It could be normal, but it might not be, and we can't tell the difference.|`|7xit1ogxaa	I'm sorry for your loss. After a miscarriage a woman will typically bleed for 1-2 weeks, it can stop and start back, it can be heavy and go to light, or it could get heavier. It wouldn't be your period. Your period won't return until 4-6 weeks after your miscarriage. If you are worried you can always call your doctor. Take care.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you can't get in touch with your doctor call your local hospital.
6VbNJOtfaa	I did not know I was pregnant until 5.5 months, so I do not think that it is nuts not to know you are pregnant.  I did not gain any weight, and was a college student who had 2 jobs, and was very busy.  I had my period sporadically, and did not have any symptoms.  Luckily for me (and my son and his daddy) I do not smoke or drink or do drugs so there was no harm done.  I also have been taking prenatal vitamins for years (after the shiny hair/nails craze).  As soon as I found out, there really was not anything that I needed to change.<br>  <br>  I worked in an establishment that serves alcohol and I remember one woman who was in there drinking all the time.  She obviously had a problem.  She was a bigger woman and had a tummy on her.  She went in to labor while sitting on the bar stool.  She ended up with a healthy full term baby boy.  I was amazed that someone could be pregnant for so long and not know!|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I think so.  I wonder how these cases can possibly be true.  I have had a women tell me that she did not know she was pregnant with her child until she went into labor and I still don't believe her.  She had these things that were basically excuses.  "Oh I was very active and very small so I never had periods.  So not having periods wasn't new to me."  <br>  <br>  Not having periods is a reason to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  And she swore she never got bigger.  Being a small waisted women myself I got pretty noticeable soon.  I know all bodies are different but even with my preemie I was large.<br>  <br>  "I never felt it move."  And she never gave a reason for that.  I know thick placentas can make movement not very noticeable but still!  I can't believe these women.|`|AA11106675	What I think is crazy is that you have to ask if this is a little crazy.  Yah, it's a bit over the top.|`|AA11537580	they may be in denial|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Yes, it is.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	I had a friend that didn't know she was pregnant for 6 months. She didn't miss a period until then and she a little on the heavy side and didn't really show it until then.  I think she was even taking birth control the whole time.<br>  <br>  It's not crazy, it can happen. If there's no reason to think you are pregnant there's no reason to take a test.<br>  <br>  I've seen plenty of pregnant women smoking throughout their entire pregnancy (one worked in my building). Maybe they WANT their kid to have a low birth weight to make the delivery easier. <br>  (that was a joke for you people who can't discern humor without being told)<br>  <br>  Shove your thumbs up your butts.  Why are people always so touchy with these pregnancy questions?|`|UYfqzCoMaa	They may have irregular periods so they don't know that they are pregnant like women with regular periods. However they should notice the weight gain and all the other symptoms of pregnancy. Woman that have irregular periods if they are sexually active should take a pregnancy test at least every other month so that they would know for sure. They are irresponsible and it's not fair to their unborn child.|`|VS8mactUaa	Thats hat what happened when my other was pregnant with me, she only had about 2 periods a year, with ovarian cysts, she used to get a pregnancy test done every month but ust gave up after 5 years, and my mom is not a small woman she is pretty heavy. So she carried on doing her thing smoking and drinking, a week after a new years party she went to she was on a diet and ket throwing up went to the doctor and found out she was 4 or 5 months pregnant, and I was born and even with all te drinking and smoking and advil from her migraines and steroid medication for her ms, she had me and Im fine lol. I was astonished hen the family told me this then I laughed and said wow, why am I not dead.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i don't understand how some women will go without knowing themselve is pregnant until they go into labor, it is just fascinating to me.  What i think is these women probably has a lot of health issues to start with and missing periods and getting heavier are nothing special to them ... or they are just very unconcern about their health generally.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think they are dumb, they should notice that they have not started their period or that their belly seems to be getting a little bigger., people are really dumb.
e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	yeah, i do them religiously everyday, lol. still BFN. like you, to begin with i wanted BFN, so that i knew my miscarriage hormones were away, now i'm desperate for BFP! i now also buy them of ebay, they seem to work for me. before i was buying em from the chemist at 5.99 for a single! now i get em for 1.50 for 10 inc. p&p! lol i kinda feel pregnant too, sat and cried all day yesterday- dunno if its my mind playing trick. i should have been 17 weeks today- theres times i feel 'movement' inside, so i now know i'm officially mad! lol. if i don't laugh i'll cry, i swear. really hoping you get you BFP this month hun x|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I did the same thing after my miscarriage.  I was saying please be negative and was upset when it still showed positive.  Then when it finally showed negative, I cried.  Then I tested every other day saying please be positive.  I was shocked when I tested positive four weeks after the miscarriage.  I am praying that you get your BFP soon.  I have read that some women ovulate 4 weeks after the miscarriage so it could still be your month.  I am keeping my fingers crossed.  Keep us posted.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Lol your exactly like me!! When i was trying to concieve i was testing from 5 or 6 days before my period was due. I had bought bout 5 packs of 10 tests so i had loads!! If the morning test was neg id do one in afternoon and again at night!! Id do this every day till i got my period and even test on my period to be 100% sure i wasnt!! An if in the middle of the month i felt a bit sick, out id whip another preg test!!! LOL <br>  So your not alone!! :) xx<br>  Hope you get your bfp soon :) xx|`|VMASMHX6aa	Yes! And I totally drove myself mad with it this month...staring at those rubbish cheap tests, thinking 'I CAN see a line'!<br>  <br>  This month I've made a promise to myself - no cheapy test. I've got none left and haven't ordered any new ones. I've just got 2 clearblue digital tests which will only come out of their box on the day my period is due.<br>  <br>  Or, at least, that's what I tell myself now.<br>  <br>  I know just how you feel hun, wanting it to go negative and then wanting it to go positive. Rubbish!|`|AA11330407	A pregnancy test in not something to scrimp on! I would rather buy one good quality reliable test then a case of crappy ones. I took several when I was pregnant with my first and second. My first baby was a surprise that I wasn't expecting so I took several hoping they would be negative! She is now 13 and one of the biggest joys of my life.I started way too early with my second but I just knew I was so I took several until I finally got one that was positive. By the time my 3rd one came along I was a little more patient so I only took one when I was several days late. It's hard to wait for something like that though, you want to know NOW!!!!|`|sk46uigvaa	Yes i am!!<br>  <br>  I buy them really cheap next day delivery <a href="http://www.accessdiagnostics.co.uk/acatalog/copy_of_pregnancy_tests.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accessdiagnostics.co.uk/acata...</a><br>  <br>  It's just something i can't resist, Iv worked out i spent about ￡700 on HPT's in the last 3 years that iv been ttc!!! It's lucky i discovered the website!<br>  <br>  Good luck hope You get Your BFP!! X|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	I hear the ones you buy on ebay are garbage.  My sister is a compulsive tester ... she does it every month multiple times.  I on the other hand never test .... I'll wait till I'm at least a week late to test ... rather than waste money.  I guess everyone is different and looks at things differently.  Try waiting!  Good luck ... I wish you the best!!!
mf3OOagMaa	Congratulations! It sounds like you are both probably still in shock - hopefully, you are able to see the miracle that this truly is. Babies are a blessing!  The best website for you to become familiar with is babycenter.com There is A LOT of helpful information here - for both of you.  I have 4 children & have basically gone through 3 different decades of having children (1 in 1987, 1 in 1994, & twins in 2007). Your question becomes a trick question as - it isn't so much what would you do differently, because over time technology & practices change - so really it isn't up to you. As a result, instead of telling you what I would change, I am just going to give you some pointers - based on my experiences (sorry for length).  FIRST TRIMESTER: 1. Change your diet. Eat organically when it makes sense (especially in fruits & vegetables that you eat the skin). Drink organic milk. Get the chemicals out of your diet & drink LOTS of water.   2. Begin finding education sources.  3. Start looking for pretty / cute maternity clothes. It will help you get used to the idea of being pregnant - & will give you something to wear that dreadful morning that you wake up to find that your regular clothes don't fit.  4. Stock up on crackers - ginger snap cookies & sour hard candies go along way with helping through morning sickness.  5. Keep a change of clothes in your car - just in case you are away from home (at work) & get sick. Keep a toothbrush / paste in your purse - for the same reason  6. Did I mention drink lots of water - keep a water bottle with you at all times. Think of it as another appendage!  7. Do not smoke or drink alcohol - the risks are too great. Some docs will tell you to totally avoid caffeine (though in moderation, it shouldn't be a problem)...Decaf coffee still has caffeine in it & Starbucks (regular) is loaded with it!  8. Begin building your "nest" with your boyfriend /  husband. Keep eachother as the most important persons in your lives. NO ONE ELSE MATTERS - this is a time about you. It is expected that you will be selfish. 9. Change your routine - talk to your doctor about exercising, lifting, walking, etc  10. Celebrate! Celebrate! Celebrate! If you understood all of the magic that is involved with becoming pregnant - how hard it really is for a baby to come about - you would feel like the most important person in the world. You have one of the world's greatest treasures inside of you - celebrate it.  11. Find a doctor that you trust and respect and that practices the style of childbirth that you want to have. Some docs only do c-sections, some will do a totally natural birth, some will let you birth in a tub - find the doctor that fits you.  12. Take your prenatal vitamins...there is an organic version that contains ginger (ginger will help minimize morning sickness) - take these pills EVERY DAY!  13. Talk to your employers about what leaves of absence are available to you - both, as many states offer paternity leave too (where dad can have bonding time too!)  2ND TRIMESTER: 1. Continue on with practices learned though Trimester 1  2. Begin setting up babies space  3. Remind yourself that you are not fat - you are pregnant. You are supposed to gain weight and become swollen. It is okay!  4. Register for birthing classes. Even if you want a vaginal delivery - educate yourself on c-section practices. It's REALLY scary if an emergency happens in the delivery room & you wind up having an emergency c-section.  5. Keep drinking lots of water and taking your Prenatal Vitamins 6. Get lots of rest  7. Remember that this pregnancy isn't only about you - your significant other is scared too - & maybe a little jealous - he doesn't get to feel the baby flutters & kicks the same way that you do.  8. Invest in a body pillow or pregnancy pillow - it will help you sleep better  9. Start filling out leave of absence paperwork - find out how & when to submit.  3RD TRIMESTER:  1. Keep doing what you have been doing.  2. Start getting organized. Do you have a birthing plan?  3. Start getting your suitcase together for the hospital (more on this below)  4. Keep educating yourself - don't scare yourself with the information, educate yourself with it  5. You will likely begin feeling Braxton Hicks contractions - these can be uncomfortable to painful. Only worry if "cramps" last longer than a minute & you have more that six in an hour - that increase in intensity. A heating pad or ice pack may help ease these. Lay on your side, not your back (if you are on your back, you can block a vein that provides nutrients to your baby). If your water breaks, you see blood, or your contractions become more intense - call your doctor! You might be in labor.  6. Drink lots of water.  7. Do something special for you - get a haicut &/or mani-pedi  8. Make sure that your cell phone has all of the key family & friend phone numbers programmed - these are the folks you will want to call when your baby is born  9. Get lots of rest - you are going to need it. Accept help whenever offered!  10: Have your babies carseat professionally installed (check with your local fire department) - learn how to use it (dont wait until you are bringing the baby home to do this - you will kick yourself if you do)  11. Determine if you have a boy - will he be circumsized (how? when?)  12. Find out from your doctor their opinion of the hospitals breastffeding consultant - would you benefit from spending time with this person? The consultant at my last birth was HORRIBLE - she flicked my baby in the face. I wanted to punch her. To her it was a job -she never had kids - yet she was the "professional" - she was a waste of time.    PACKING FOR THE HOSPITAL:  1. After you have your baby you will NOT be your pre-pregancy weight. You will not fit in these clothes. Pack something comfortable to go home in: a pretty maternity outfit or sweats. Keep with the slip-on flat healed shoes.  2. Pack an outfit / blanket for your baby to go home in. Pack socks for your babies feet for your hospital stay (the hospital will supply recieving blankets, t-shirts, and hat), but not socks - keep track of these, because they can disappear. Pack an outfit / hat / blanket that your baby will wear for their pictures (if you don't have anything your stuck with what you have) - there is not a 2nd chance for these pics  3. Bring your cell phone & charger - so that you can keep in touch with family & friends (you will also be able to know who is calling you - so you can determine if you feel like talking or not) - the hospital room phones don't have caller ID - I just shut mine off & used my cell (the wrong #'s were annoying!).  4. Bring a cd player & relaxing music - ENYA is perfect (this isn't a time for party music). It will keep you & your baby relaxed, & drown out the hospital noises.  5. Pack snack foods / drinks for you & your husband - the cafeteria isn't open 24 hours.  6. Bring a roll of quarters - because even if the cafeteria is closed, vending machines might be open  7. Bring your celebratory item (You know the "Its a boy" / "its a girl" thing...bubblegum or choc. cigars, suckers, M&M's, whatever...  8. Bring a nice package of cookies (Trader Joes has a great tub selection) as a thank you for your nursing staff - it never hurts to bribe the nurses caring for you! Give this early, it will make a difference!  9. This item is debatable - some women want their own PJs, for whatever reason. Why ruin them????? Wear the hospital gowns as long as possible & invest in a pretty robe and slippers instead! Anything that the hospital offers to wear will save your personal stuff from damage - the netted underwear are a blessing (keep some for home)  10. Don't forget your toiletries (shampoo/conditioner, toothbrush / toothpaste, etc - for you & your hubby!)  11. Especially if your husband can stay in the room with you make sure he has extra clothes & that you have your own pillows from home.  12. ESPECIALLY if you plan to nurse, bring your Boppy pillow with you. If you have a c-section, you will be glad that you did! If you don't have a c-section, you will be glad that you did.  13. Bring your Drivers License or Pic ID & your medical card: You will need this to check into the hospital & to complete your babies birth certificate / ss card registrations & 1 credit card or check book - for your babies first picture package. YOU will not need your purse - it will be hard to keep track of...leave your purse & jewelry at home (this way you do not have to worry about it being lost or stolen)  14. Make sure that everyone knows your preferences towards using pacifiers & bottles vs nursing. If you are breastfeeding & a nurse decides to bottle feed your baby it can make breastfeeding A LOT harder than it needs to be.  15. Bring magazines / something for both you & your hubby to do.  16. If you are on any medications - inhaler for asthma, etc bring these with! You will have to ask to use them - & there is a whole process for this, but if you have your supply - you can use it while you are waiting for the hospitals prescription to be filled. This is important, especially if you have something like asthma. Don't forget to pack your prenatal vitamins & any medication your hubby will need (he may plan to go home at night - but wind up staying the entire time with you)  17. Bring your digital / video cameras - you are going to want lots of pictures - don't forget extra batteries & chargers!  18. Have the name & address  - and your room information handy so that friends & family can find you for visiting or gifts.  LASTLY, whether you decide to go through with this or not - whether dad decides to stay in the picture or not...you are not alone, there are plenty of folks out there that would be happy to help you. You are stronger than you think. Cherish this time of your life!|`|1VOsRV8Maa	With my first pregnancy, it was a product of a rape. I got married to my husband when I was 6 months along, and his dr told him he may never be able to conceive. (He had extensive back surgery after being thrown from a horse in 2006, and it messed up his lower anatomy. The Drs didn't even think he'd be able to "get it up") Anyhow, to say the least, our baby is now 8 months old and I'm 12 weeks pregnant with #2! Since I do get a chance to do it again, there isn't much that I will do different except be patient! I wanted to go early SO badly with my first, and he ended up being TEN days overdue! With this one, the dr told me my estimated due date is sept 10, but I won't be expecting baby to come til at least a week later! :)|`|NG1rGIcpaa	I hated every minute of both of my pregnancies.  The only part I liked were the ultrasounds.  I love both of my children beyond anything in the world but hated the whole pregnancy thing.  <br>  <br>  If I could do my son all over again, I wouldn't have gained the 40lbs I did.  With my daughter (born this past October) I was much more careful and am happy to say I'm thinner now than I was before I had my son.  But I do still have stretch marks from my son's pregnancy (7 years ago).  That is the only lingering thing from either.<br>  <br>  Don't make yourself crazy if you haven't thought much about it.  I didn't really think much about my second one either.  Now that she is here though I'm so thrilled.  She was the best decision I ever made next to having my son.  Yeah for Mommyhood!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless! It's going to be great!|`|AA10478146	First, GREAT question.  I wish I would have thought to ask it.  I'm 41 weeks today and 33 yrs. old with my first.  If I could do anything different I think I would have tried harder to keep up with my exercise routine; I stopped when I was 5 months along.  I've tried to eat healthy but, I think I could have done a better job.  Also, I wish we would have taken a picture of my growing belly each month.  I don't really have many pregnancy pictures.  Good luck to you and congrats!|`|AA10071149	I would have tried harder to keep my weight in check. I had terrible morning sickness and quit going to the gym for a few months. Once I could start eating again, I pigged out. I exercised, but not as much as I should have. Plus, I didn't really have any restraint when I craved sweets.<br>  This time around (I'm 13 weeks), I'm exercising more and trying to watch what I eat.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	I wish I would have eaten better/healthier, there was no problem with the baby but my stomach will never look the same.<br>  <br>  I also wish I would have taken the time to enjoy the baby...instead of letting tiredness get the best of me.|`|AA12205301	Don't go overboard on trying to be safe and health consious.  Yes you do have do a little more.  But you can take cold meds,allergy meds, tylenol etc if needed. This is straight from my doctor. Don't get unnecessary ultra sounds.  It was proven over 20 years ago that it was unsafe for babies.  The midwives have known about it.  It just came out in a mainstream med journal a couple years ago, that it is unsafe.  Don't go out and buy a bunch of junk that babies do not truly need. All they need are onesies, diapers, a shampoo that doubles as bath wash, cloths for bath, lotion, clippers, nose aspirator, one piece pj's, crib or bassinet.  They don't need designer clothes, second hand works fine because the baby grows so fast and also spits up and it stains.  Don't be afraid to get out and be active, long gone are the days when you had to lay down or do nothing while pregnant.  Also, if miscarriage, you do not have to go to the  hospital right away and have a d&C.  YOu can do it at home. Just sit on the toilet and let it flow out. It takes a couple hours, but it all cleans out on its own. Sorry, but miscarriages are a fact of life.  You do not need to rush to the hospital for every little thing. This is also knowledge from my midwife and me (I did it at home no doctors help).  For your trip to the delivery, you don't need a whole bunch of crap to take. All you need is a bring home outfit for the baby, a carseat, clothes for you to be comfortable coming home in, and whatever entertains you. But be warned you won't have much time for entertainment.  Also, knowledge from my midwife and experience from me (3 kids), do not push. I know the doctors etc say "push push", but let me tell you, if you just let it happen without pushing it works alot better. You don't tear or have as much recovery to do afterward. Also, laying down during deliver sucks.  It is better to move around, on a ball, squatting whatever, but do not lay down.  Also, do not go out and buy yourself all these expensive maternity outfits, you will grow out of them too soon, then be left with all these cute clothes that you can't wear. Waste of money.  Do eat alot of fruits and veggies.  Keep yourself hydrated, exercise, walking is great.  SEx doesn't bring on contractions, but it is fun anyway!!! And you can have sex up until the water breaks. Water birth is awsome. Go with a midwife if you can. Much better than a doctor and hospital.  <br>  All my pregnancies were great. But my first and last deliveries were the best. My middle one I chose an epideral and it didnt work. Not only that, it made me have to lay down to deliver. My first one I squatted, and my third was water birth, birthing ball and no pushing. I was back to having sex with my husband in 2 weeks after that delivery. With no pain during intercourse. My main advice---- you don't need to spend alot of money on useless things like quilts, and crib accessories, clothes etc, you don't have to be extra careful about medications, you can do alot of things naturally that alot of people think you need to go to the doctor for. ONe more thing.... most people follow doctors blindly and think they know everything, they really don't and there is alot of natural remedies, natural ways to do things without hurting the baby or you. I know this, because I live it.  Also, get a squirt bottle like a ketchup or mustard bottle from the kitchen supply department in walmart or winco, and put warm water in it to wash yourself after urinating after delivery. Works wonders and feels good.  Also, use tucks pads after delivery to soothe yourself, the walmart generic brand works fine.  One more thing, the only ones that need to be called after delivery is the grandparents, they will call everyone else.  And when you get home, take a few days to rest and ask people to give you that time. If you don't make it clear, you will have people popping in and out at all times and never get rest or relaxation. <br>  <br>  My last delivery I took a car seat and an outfit for the baby. I was at the midwifes at 5 pm, had the baby at 8:04 pm and was home at 12:30 am.  So I was only there for about 7 1/2 hours from start to finish. And the next day, had alot of visiters and it didnt hit me until about 5 pm.  I wish I would have remembered to tell people to give me a few days. <br>  <br>  To the person below me: great advice on some of it, but you have really made it all more complicated than it is.  Why drag all that stuff to the hospital, just so you have to take care of it and drag it back out afterwards. Take as little as possible, that way you can focus on getting home faster.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I would have relaxed and slept a lot more that's for sure but you will find that hard to do towards the end too. I also wish I would have eaten healthier and exercised more I gained 48lbs and still have about 25 left to lose 4 weeks postpartum:-( Being that you are a top contributor in diet and fitness you probably won't have that problem:-) Congrats on the pregnancy and hope all goes well for you!|`|mAxChwHTaa	i would have taken more pictures for sure.... but definately dont eat for two your baby doesnt need it... plus if you dont gain a bunch of weight its easier to get back to your regular size (back in size 2 in 1.5 months) plus i wouldnt have stressed out so  much! enjoy it more and plenty of rest!!|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i would not do it again for all the money in the world.  it was misery.  i was very sick...couldnt eat...lost 15 pounds...diarrhea....vomiting....heart palpitations....lol.  no thanks.  however...i am pregnant with baby number 2 and this time around it isnt as deathly.....still misery...but i dont feel like dying most days.|`|h93SVSxLaa	Honestly enjoy every day of it. With my son i didn't know i was pregnant for quite a while (won't go into why) and i missed a lot of the "firsts" when they should have been firsts. With my daughter i rubbed my belly and embraced everything that came with  it knowing she was going to be my last. All i really can say is just embrace it. Take time for yourself while you can. Go shopping in peace have all the fun in the world decorating the room and really love what you do with it. give into the cravings...who cares if you gain an extra pound from the 4th bowl of ice cream...or in my case the cheeseburger and chicken nuggets everyday for lunch. make your bf or husband or whatever he is a big part of the pregnancy as well. when you feel the baby kick make sure he gets to feel it as well. My husbnad said he didn't care to feel it everyday BUT by the end he missed feeling it when they would only kick when he was gone. Really Take time to pamper yourself as well. Congrats Good Luck!!
X5FVNfQXaa	Amniocentesis testing is usually done if either of the babies parents are 35 or older or subject to a disorder due to either of the parents medical histories or ethnic backgrounds. After age 35 of either parent the risk of down syndrome increases every year. This test is done in the first trimester and can also tell you the sex of your baby before you can actually see it. I haven't ever heard of this causing problems when the baby is born, but I haven't heard that it doesn't, I'm not sure either way but I wouldn't think so as it is a normal test. If your Dr. doesn't think you need one, you probably don't.|`|AA10468184	If they are just measuring the amount of fluid, they don't need to do an amniocentesis.  It can be done by ultrasound.  If they are trying to test the fluid for lung maturity or birth defects it is an amniocentesis.<br>  Editing to add that anytime you puncture your skin, you can develop an infection.|`|bGRexKPyaa	Oh hell no I didnt do it. First it can hurt. Second that tiny little hole put into your uterus can cause a miscarriage..The hole can stretch....<br>  <br>  Dont do it!!!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Amniocentesis. They usually don't even offer it unless they suspect something is wrong or other testing has shown a higher risk of genetic defects. Even then you don't have to do it. There is a window of opportunity, I would say, where you need to get it done if you're going to, but it carries a risk of miscarriage.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I heard it's done if your 35 and older.|`|WLNX00c3aa	amneo testing?  it shouldnt hurt the baby at all. what they do is feel and do ultra sounds to make sure the baby is not in the area where they put the thin needle. they do a local anesthetic and then put the thin needle in. <br>  <br>  i'll be doing it since i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with our baby...this is our first one.|`|AA11208683	like most people said it called an amniocentesis. and it is extremely safe. the risk that the procedure will result in a miscarriage is as low as 1 in 1,600. you will experience cramping after the procedure for a few hours but it will go away with plenty of rest. its usually done between 16 to 18 weeks. i hope this helps. Good luck.|`|GpR5MI5raa	its an amniocentesus. i didnt have one because im under 35.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	it is done for diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities etc etc
VGij9p0Taa	Congrats on your little girl! <br>  Both names are absolutely adorable, Eve meaning life is a very pretty name and ages well a timeless classic. Both names are great and very classy. <br>  Eve Natalia Olson - Reminds me of a girl who is very lively and full of mischief. Who likes to have fun. I picture her having tanned skin, big dark  eyes and black straight hair. <br>  Eve Sophia Olson - Reminds me of a girl with, blonde curly hair, big blue eyes someone who is very shy and quite. Her intelligence shining through. <br>  Yet even though both the people I picture with the names I like and both the names sould very wholesome and pretty. But my favourite is Eve Natalia Olson, just because it sounds slightly more harder and formal, a little more unusual too. <br>  I hope I helped you with everything and god bless!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	eve natalia sounds better|`|h57t7FAjaa	Most people won't know the middle name, so it's not as important as the first!  I think Eve is beautiful though :)<br>  <br>  If I had to choose I think it'd be Eve Natalia Olson, only because it flows better.  Although both names are lovely!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck :)|`|fboC1N7gaa	Eve Sophia Olson  (although I might be biased since my name is Sophia Eve... but I love my name!)|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Eve Sophia Olson|`|AA10325228	I like Eve Sophia Olsen, it flows better.|`|iZDsMCghaa	The names are all pretty seperate but they sound choppy together, especially Eve Sophia Olson. Eva Sophia sounds a little better sophia olsn is still kinda choppy.<br>  Same with Natalia, I think Eva Natalia flows better but Natalia olson is a little choppy. But to pick one Id say Eve Natalia.<br>  If you stick with Eve I think you should consider mn starting with A sound and not ending with a,e or o sound.<br>  Can I offer  couple choices?<br>  Eve Arianne (airy-anne) Olson<br>  Eve Analise Olson<br>  Eve Angeline Olson|`|g8JGLnk6aa	Eve Sophia Olson. It sounds better. Plus "Natalia" is just strange. What's wrong with just "Natalie"? Natalie is so much better.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Eve Sophia is gorgeous! I say go with that one =)|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think Eve Sophia Olson flows better, so i chose that one.<br>  <br>  And the name Eve makes me think of a cute, sweet, friendly somewhat hyper lil girl.  Lol i used to babysit a lil girl named Eve and this how she was, so yea.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i like both of them. :)|`|8w2o6qHyaa	Eve Natalia Olson is nicer.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Eve Sophia|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	Eve Sophia flows better but its really up to you.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I like both names equally - very pretty!<br>  <br>  I love the name Eve, too, but as a nickname that is short for Evelyn or Evangeline or Evianna. <br>  <br>  Either way - good luck and congrats!<br>  <br>  If I had to pick - Eve Natalia Olson sounds better to me.|`|yNV2kRlbaa	Eve Natalia would be a beautiful, dark haired, tan, mysterious type. <br>  <br>  Eve Sophia would be maybe kind of like a librarian type...brown hair..simple, boring<br>  <br>  So I'd have to say I prefer Eve Natalia because it congers up a  better image|`|xmmpqySUaa	Eve Natalia Sophia Olsen.I think it would be good to have both ur name and ur great grandmothers name in her name so when that day comes and she asks who that is you can explain to her and she will feel special that she has ur Great grandmas name in her name|`|R8fVBPnmaa	uh`mm  how `bout "NAY~NAY"!?!   ;-D|`|fPuZGkmsaa	I really Like Eve Sophia Olson. I think that the name flows very well and sounds very sophisticated for when she is older. Plus be adorable when she is younger. Good choices. It was hard to pick.|`|K9DBEeu2aa	both are just ok. but the 2nd one if i had to. <br>  SORRY.|`|61NKzPzMaa	The names don't seem to flow really well. I suppose Eve Sophia flows better.<br>  <br>  I think that Natalia Eve and Sophia Eve flow better.|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	Love the name Eve. Eve Sophia Olson is lovely.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Eve Sophia Olson<br>  <br>  wow thats a beautiful name =)|`|8PIGQp16aa	Eve Natalia|`|3KoGUAfLaa	Eve Sophia. It even flows better in Spanish. Eva Sofia. :D Very pretty!|`|NroZQN5vaa	I guess Eve Sophia but it's maybe slightly awkward to have such a long middle name with such a short first name.|`|dn00Yw3taa	Eve Sophia!|`|eJMIazhLaa	Eve Sophia Olson.  They are both very pretty names though.|`|47M20WOUaa	I like Eve Sophie Olson it sounds great :)|`|PvnnWE1Baa	I love Eve Sophia, that is beautiful! I think of a cute little girl w/ black hair, don't ask me why I just do. lol|`|xtYTbUxGaa	The name Eve Natalia Olson makes me think of a stuck-up, snooty girl, while Eve Sophia Olson makes me think of a softer, innocent girl.|`|SJEqXq21aa	well natalia is more latino ofcourse which is awesome i did the same. my daughters middle name is in spanish.<br>  so i like eve natalia olson..<br>  sounds very nice|`|zHBzYodKaa	personally I believe that Eve Sophia Olson is better.|`|6v4Gblxkaa	Eve Sophia Olson|`|BAUrpYqIaa	Eve Sophia Olson<br>  <br>  Natalia..i think of an evil russian spy<br>  sophia is nice
5QtseYWuaa	Nancy was my grandmothers name. She passed away last April. I like it a lot and was actually thinking of naming my child with Nancy in her name. I think a lot of people think well thats to mature sounding for a little girl but what they forget is that someday that little girl is gonna be an adult. I think it is beautiful.|`|K7AhV4Diaa	I love that name, nancy is becoming more known in countries such as Engand. In my opinion, it is hip and trendy and YOUNG! (tyvm the person above). Use it for your girl, mayb i will too!|`|SJEqXq21aa	It's alright.. <br>  but u should think of a more unique name..<br>  Nancy is a very common name. but its nice.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Kind of old, but classic- I like. Very Fancy! (haha, get it?)|`|uRrLjFp9aa	bit victorian ish i think|`|AA10325228	I don't like it, It sounds like an old lady to me.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that it sounds older, but paired with a cute trendy middle name that it could be really pretty.|`|Btlr3Ij7aa	Not a fan. It's boring and I have only known middle aged aunts named Nancy... it's not appealing for any age bracket. Sorry!|`|ValLVBcYaa	Just remember, that ''little girl'' will eventually become an adult.|`|47M20WOUaa	I have a aunt named Nancy Go for it|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I like it. I think that names like this should be used more these days!
WWfL5tMvaa	when i got married an OB told me relax and don't think of it for at least a year then after thAT start testing and checking things.<br>  Relaxation is so important for this. I know it is easy said I am also TTC #2 and i can't just keep it off my mind.<br>  they also say a normal couple when the woman is less than 30 it takes her 6  months to conceive and for older it takes 12 months so take is easy. Try to enjoy. Try to relax. and keep trying<br>   BABY DUST TO YOU AND  TO EVERYONE TTC|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	Ive been trying for about 6 mos and I feel like you ... I am so over the negatives.  I went to the doctor last month (but just for a check-up) and I talked to him about my issues.  He said for me to keep trying ... get a notebook and write down EVERYTHING - when my period starts, ends, when i have sex, etc.  And if in a few months i am still not pregnant to schedule an appt with him and bring my book so he can see whats been going on.  He said to have sex every other day from day 11-20.  I am doing this for about the next 5 mos and then I will go back in to talk to him. <br>  <br>  Also, I never knew before when I ovulated so lately I have been trying to keep track.  I am on my second month of Fertility Blend for Women ... its an all natural vitamin that supports reproductive health.  I have heard it works, so we will see.  BUT I have only been on it 1 month and my ovulation signs were like WOA obvious.  I got the egg white mucus right on schedule ... it was so noticeable.  Never before have I gotten it like that.  Hopefully it will work.  I got it off iHerb.com the cheapest.  If you want to try them use this coupon code "AMA604" and you will get $5.00 off!|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I'm so sorry that it has been this long...I will pray for you this month! I read online that if you are under 35 and have not concieved for over one year of trying that you should go to the doctor. Check out this site...<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_fertility-risk-factors_3535.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_fertility-ri...</a>|`|YIb23obFaa	don't stress too much about ttc, it usually happens when your not expecting it so go on with your life and baby dance on the days you should! and you will see! good luck to you. don't worry i had a boyfriend before for about a year we used the pull out method i was NOT ttc and i never got pregnant but with my boyfriend now we have been together forever it only took us three months, WHEN I wasn't expecting anything but i had a miscarriage, but now we are ttc havent seen anything in months! so dont worry too much about it. and just to be on the safe side you could go anytime to see if you are fertile.|`|xoQxDGAlaa	I would wait for a year. My doctor was so mean to me when I went in after only trying for 9 months, already having one miscarriage and 11 cycles of trying. I'm on cycle 18 now and still not pregnant but nothing is wrong with me. It is extremely frustrating and the drs are not much help. It's hard when people to tell you to relax. I've done so much relaxing! Good luck to you though!|`|VqmaOcUIaa	GO NOW!!<br>  I was told after a yr of unprotected sex if your not getting pregnant something is abnormal. 9 months is long enuf!<br>  You may have issues in regards to ovulation, timing, internal reproductive abnormalities, or hubbys sperm may be low <br>  Get a referral to a RE and get busy, dont let time pass you by..<br>  Im on a treatment for fertility myself, this is my 2nd cycle with meds...im hoping it will stick this month..<br>  Add me as a contact , we can enjoy the ride together...
PklJzGQRaa	happen to me too so i got off the shot.  I wasn't pregnant.  I got on the 10yr IUD and that had no hormones which helped me lose about 15lbs and made everything more regular
sbeoF50gaa	I would take this to the school board stating that the school is letting you down, letting your daughter fall through the cracks, and are not doing their best to ensure every student has equal opportunities. If you believe your daughter needs special classes and they have not taken the steps to evaluate her they are not doing their jobs. I'd go to the school board and complain and tell them they need to get their act together.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Go to your state's Board of Education. <br>  <br>  It is the responsibility of all public schools to address the needs of their children as long as funding permits- and when there is no state funding, that is when federal funding should kick in. As long as your daughter is enrolled at that school and you can document any attempt of communicating with that school's administration, they will be forced to assist in your child's learning or be subject to scrutiny- which could include closing down the school.|`|X6as2nOAaa	This may get me a thumb's down and people may think that im lying but when I was in high school, all the adults would pretend to care about their students but yet they never would seem to help. I had problems in school and none of them tried to help me. I switched schools and at first it was great but then that same thing happened.|`|gt4VHiJ5aa	go 2 your daughters principal and demand that something b done and if that fails go over there heads write a letter to the school board stating how long you have been trying 2 get your daughter help but it falling on deaf ears|`|0vLU2GGGaa	... and they say no child left behind.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to try tutoring schools or change her to another school.|`|7tqsF9hdaa	What classes is she failing? She may just need a tutor for math or science (usually related).<br>  <br>  As a teacher, I understand that parents worry about their kids at school, especially when things aren't going right and you can't seem to find the source of the problem. But depending on the size of the school, the guidance counselor may have some serious fires to put out on a daily basis and she/he really doesn't have time to probe your daughter's mind if she isn't being very forthcoming. Which she probably isn't, if she's like every other teenager on the planet.<br>  <br>  You're going to have to sit your daughter down and have a hard conversation with her about what's going on. Team up with her father, if that's an option. I can guarantee you, she's not giving the guidance counselor anything to work with. Teeangers are secretive by nature.<br>  <br>  You have to realize that school is probably not the source of her problems, and the school can't go very far in solving them. Falling grades are usually only a symptom of a larger problem. Go and speak with the district's ADA compliance person about the testing, but realize that her tanking grades may be non-school-related.<br>  <br>  Either way, it's probably going to fall to you to get her some counseling outside of school before you see an improvement in her grades. I really wish you the best of luck. I know as a single mom it's daunting, but there are resources available to you, and I wish you all the luck in the world making use of them.
4SKIE1C8aa	For a boy I like Jude Thomas and for a girl the best is Agatha. For plenty of unusual names try <a href="http://www.namenerds.com/uucn" rel="nofollow">http://www.namenerds.com/uucn</a>|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I love the name Jude for a boy and I liked Agatha for a girl.  <br>  Some unusual boys names are thinks like Rory (Roar-y), Hamish (Hame-ish - not ham-ish), Fenner and Tobias.<br>  As for a girl you may also like Agnes, Audrey, Cecily, Amelia, Lydia, Lucia/Lucinda or Clara.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|xtYTbUxGaa	I like Payton or Ashton for a boy and Mackenzie for a girl.

2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	I've never heard of stomach tenderness being a sign of pregnancy...|`|Tl9bgQzFaa	well what i got to say is did you tell the doctor that you been having pains like dat but i think it is the shots got yo stomach tender like that.|`|QqFPNti4aa	You are probably not pregnant.  And your stomach being tender is not a sign of pregnancy.
xoQxDGAlaa	That's how my miscarriage went. I had very light brownish blood for 3-4 days before red blood and that's when I miscarried. I hope everything is ok for you but know we're all here for you no matter what!|`|nVEBL4ukaa	The same thing happen to me 4 1/2 years ago.  Yes I miscarried I had an ultrasound and didn't fine anything. I hope your case is different. I wish you luck. I went through so many blood test until the levels just dropped and wasn't coming up anymore. <br>  The doctor but me on folic acid and said I'll see you in 3 months and when I did.... I was pregnant for #3.|`|J8XL3u7aaa	well no if you had a miscarriage from your vaginal your would imidently drop chunks of blood and then keep dropping them later after that but i hope things go well respond on how the ultrasound went and conrats on the kid ALWAYS PUT IT FIRST BEFORE ANY GUY OR ANY FRIEND|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	go to a doctor when you are scared|`|KozoNqpsaa	Try not to stress about it. With my first baby, I had bright red blood at 7 weeks and it scared us to death. Turned out to be just fine...with my second baby, I started bleeding heavily at 5 months and I was terrified. The doctors actually thought I was hemoraging and would lose the baby but it stopped after a few hours and again, turned out just fine. <br>  <br>  Some women just have unexplained bleeding during pregnancy but it isn't always cause for alarm. You don't mention what week you're in here, but it sounds like your doctor is watching you closely. The ultrasound will hopefully put your mind at ease and since you're hcg levels are still high, that's a very good sign that the baby is A-OK.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!!|`|AA11595906	Some women have full blown periods when pregnant.  Good luck!
vue9NOhYaa	Not directly. It might make YOU sick, however. (And excessive vomiting could lead to dehydration.)<br>  <br>  Don't intentionally swallow shampoo. If you accidently swallow a bit (like while risning your hair), don't worry about it.|`|4QBvQ9gDaa	Depends how much. If by accident than no, but if you drank more than 3 ounces than yes.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Probably not. It may cause a little diarrhea and vomiting so drink plenty of liquids to prevention dehydration. Now, if you are craving shampoo and other non-food items, you need to tell your OBGYN right now because that is PICA. It's eating non-food items like soap, dirt, laundry detergent, paint, etc. It's caused by a very low level of iron or other nutrients so you need to be evaluated immediately if this was on purpose.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|FH2iKFcJaa	Why would you swallow shampoo ever????|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If it was an accident, No. If you're eating it, yeah.
62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	I'm due to have my baby August 29th and I can tell you that I am NOT happy about being 30 pounds heavier than normal, hormonal during the hottest period of the entire year. I live in Houston and it gets into the 100s with high humidity and this summer is going to be miserable for me. I'd choose winter, that way when my body temperature is up- the cold will feel nice to me.|`|F4FJVq37aa	I would prefer the mid-seasons (fall, spring). But if I had to chose summer or winter I would choose summer. It REALLY sucks being pregnant during the hot hot summer, but once you have that baby you don't have to worry about having an infant in really cold conditions. Of course I haven't had a winter baby, so I might be a little biased.|`|wb781QEzaa	me personally in the summer cause in the winter there tend to be moe people with colds and you dont want everyone coming over to see the new baby and end up getting the baby sick. my kids were born in april and november. i had less health problems with my april baby than my november. she was bck in the hospital one week after she was brought home from the hospital with brochncitis.|`|PklJzGQRaa	summer- then you don't have to worry about your little one getting the flu so early in life.  I'd like to have my next one late feb so that I always have taxes by his/her b-day<br>  <br>  EDIT i did have a winter baby and it wasn't fun at all, I couldn't take her out much|`|AA11327039	Very early summer.  That way you're not getting out of bed four hundred times a night when it's freezing cold.  By the time winter rolls around the child likely will be sleeping through the night and you'll be able to stay in your toasty warm bed all night long.<br>  <br>  Also the days are longer in the summer so when little bit wakes up at 5am it's already a bit sunny as opposed to winter when it's  still dark at 7am  Psychologically, it's easier to get up if it's already sunny.
sIrCiDHcaa	3 days late you could possibly be pregnant but i would give it another week or so and see if your period doesn'tt come if not take a home pregnancy test and see what comes up if your still unsure and no period i would recommend going and getting a blood test to be sure. you do seem to be experiencing pregnancy symptoms and most of these around the right time that you should be based on the normal women and pregnancy. and if all else fails and you are not pregnantdon'tt give up keep on trying butdon'tt think about it all the time because it will bring you down i know from experience im still trying after 4 unsuccessful years it can be heart breaking and make you go into depression literally. lol.. keep me updated and baby dust to both of us good luck hun|`|txSiQc7Waa	You definitely seem to be experiencing signs of pregnancy but I'd wait a few days to make sure af doesn't show up. Testing too soon can give you a false negative and really bring ya down. The longer you wait, the better results you'll get plus it gives time for your hcg levels to rise :) If you're more than a week late for you period and getting negative tests, it's best to make an appt with your dr to see what's going on :) Good luck to you and baby dust! I hope this is both of our months!|`|z1LZuRRiaa	If your three weeks late, you could very well be pregnant, as for the eating more that won't happen yet. The sore breast however are a dead give away, that's what I had as well as the fatigue. I would suggest getting a pregnancy test, if it is negative get a blood test for sure, if that is negative as well talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|VqmaOcUIaa	Hi Alicia<br>  Go get a HPT...if negative follow up with a blood test<br>  Sounds like signs of pregnancy<br>  Baby dust to you!|`|AA10371609	You're going to have to take a test.  That's the only way to really find out.  Chances are, you're pregnant.  But go get a test and take it.|`|14RzmDTmaa	it is possiable. i'm in the same boat as you. i have had alot of symptoms. i hope this is our month good luck girl, and keep me posted!! lots of baby dust to you and me.

No one can tell you how you need to deal with the death of your child. <br>  If he's comfortable going once a month and your not, do what you feel you need. <br>  As long as your not stuck on it, you have every right to visit often.<br>  I'm sorry for your loss.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	You know what is right for you.  Just because once a month is fine for him doesn't mean it is what you need.  When you have had enough time you will know.  Don't get mad at him because he is just experiencing the loss differently than you.  Just ask him to respect your feelings.  Twice a week is right for you.|`|AA10186411	You do whatever makes you feel better.  I think you should slowly go less, just so you can get over it.  But if you aren't comfortable with that yet, then keep doing like you are doing.  Maybe you should seek counseling.  I am so sorry for your loss, and I can't imagine the pain you feel.  Maybe a professional can help you better.|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Everyone grieves in their own way. Tell B/F (I wouldn't marry him) to stop and leave you alone. He is not you.

Some people take longer to greive, and that's ok.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	if it makes you feel better than go if that happened to me i would camp out right there!|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	People have different ways of dealing with grief. When my father passed away, I made the three-hour each way trip once a week for over a year; my sisters could barely bring themselves to even drive with me to the cemetary.<br>  <br>  You say visiting your daughter brings you peace, while it seems to do the opposite to her father. Neither of you should expect the other to adjust at this time.<br>  <br>  Please don't take this the wrong way, but have you gone to any grief counseling? A good counselor, or a grief group, can help you with your grieving as well. It will not besmirch your daughter's shortened life, nor make you feel confused because your fiance feels you might be holding back on living your own life. <br>  <br>  But you should limit your visits when YOU feel you need to, not simply because the calendar says One Year.|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	When you go does it make you even more depressed the rest of the day or even longer? Or does it make you feel closer and of course still sad but better because you are connected. If you are more 'down' after a visit, then maybe you should go less often. But if you just feel better going , then by all means, go as often as you want. On average, men, even good dads, just don't bond to babies the same way moms do. I think the best thing to do would be talk to a councilor, or minister, or best friend (not him) and ask them how you seem after a visit. If you seem worse, maybe you should try cutting back. But if not, in time you will go less often, but on your schedule, not his. I kind of think it is wrong of him to tell you how much you are allowed to grieve your daughter.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Oh my gosh, I am so sorry to hear about your loss.  It is always a tragedy when a child dies from any cause and the grief you must feel is uncomprehendable to me.  No one can tell you how or how long to grieve, you do what you need to do.  I am sure your fiance is just worried about you and wishe that the pain was not so great for you, but you were the childs mother so of course the pain is probably overwhelming even now.  It is important for you to try to move forward in your life, but it has only been a year...that is not that long, give yourself time and do what you need to do to help yourself accept this.  My prayers are with you.|`|9dDKr0Abaa	When my son first died 4 years ago I use to go to his grave twice a week sometimes more because it made me feel like I was still taking care of him in a way by taking care of his grave. Now I only go once a month not because I don't want to go more but since I've had his little brother and sister its hard to go as much as I would like. I think whatever you think is right and makes you feel good is totally fine. ((BIG HUGS)) to you!!<br>  <br>  Oh and I wanted to edit you'll never move on but it will get easier with time.|`|AA12145826	Everyone grieves differently. However, if you feel that its disrupting your life, then perhaps speaking with a grief counselor or attending a grief support group may assist you with letting go of your daughter's physical being and allowing yourself to accept that she is continuing on in your memories.<br>  <br>  You and your fiance have my deepest condolences.|`|LZVZkSHUaa	Don't let anyone tell you have to deal with your grief.  If once a month is enough for him. Ask him how he'd feel if you tried to make him go more.  Nothing can compare to loosing a child.  I am so sorry you had to go through that.  Have you looked for any support groups that may help you.<br>  God Bless you and the child you lost.  You do what you need to to make it through each day and don't let anyone else dictate that for you!!!|`|k2IIZkA3aa	I would say that if it makes you feel better, keep going. My mother used to do the same thing when my sister died as a baby. She doesn't go out to the grave that often now, but when she stopped going as much it was on her own terms when she found peace within herself about what happened. However, if it makes your feel sad/upset, I'd try to cut back how much you go. If you think it helps though, by all means keep going.|`|x2Gl6EM7aa	No you are right. Do whatever makes you happy. If you feel that visiting your daughter is the right thing then do it. Remember it's your life not for fiance's if he truly loves you then he should understand that. I am sorry you had to lose your daughter at such a young age. God bless you and your daughter and may she rest in peace and enjoy the heavens.|`|4QHanq1Laa	no not at all. nobody can tell you when it is time to move on.. my mom passed away almost three years ago and I still think about her everyday and havea  good cry once a week. go at the pace you feel comforatable with. ... <br>  <br>  im sorry to hear about your daughter, you sound like a great mom who gave her a great life.|`|1S606595aa	oh im so sorry, :[ i dont think that going there twice a week is to much,  your staying in touch with her and if that makes you feel better then you should go see her, you will have to move on soon, but never move on to forget her!|`|gt4VHiJ5aa	nobody shud ever tell you your visiting your daughters grave too much she was your daughter go as often as you can r as least as you can its your decision, my lil cousin died in a car accident 2yrs ago and we visit every week to put down fresh flowers and her mam goes as often as she can|`|jVUEohsNaa	You will probably slow down going as the pain lessens.. it will always be there, but as humans we have the ability to heal and more on.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lFlapW8maa	whatever makes you feel better.  a mothers bond is much stronger.  it may take you a little more time to move on.|`|ikPeJ0ZXaa	if it makes you feel better go as much as you want.<br>  i know how it feels, and im terribly sorry for your loss of your daughter.|`|AA11101968	Visit as much as you like, but ask yourself, do you feel better or worse after going?|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Oh sweet Jesus, God Bless your heart.  You go there as often as you need.  I cannot even fathom your situation, me I would probably pitch a tent there.  Anything that makes your heart feel better, by all means you do that.  I myself do not think it is too often.  What is good for one person is not necessarily good or right for another.  <br>  May the Lord smile upon you....|`|WlU3NFu6aa	If it makes you feel better than i think you should visit as much as you like. she's still your daughter and you are spending time with her. <br>  Just make sure its not interfering with other things in your life, like you are missing work to go to the grave. if its not, then i dont see anything wrong with spending time with her. <br>  I think maybe yout fiance sees it different;y.  maybe going to the grave is a reminder of what happened to her but unlike for you, it makes him feel bad. so he would rather not be remindedof his loss that often. <br>  GL and I am very sorry for your loss. I can even imagine what it would like. I am tearing just thinking of someone losing their baby girl (I have a 14 mo old daughter)|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	When my husband died, I when to the grave a lot<br>  Know, I wake up every morning without him, and I miss him greatly<br>  But, the grave, I go a lot less, a few time a years<br>  I take our daughter, she was two when he died, three times a year<br>  His birthday, father day, and early december.  He died christmas week, and one day she will realized that, but for know, going early december to leave a cemetery box is find<br>  <br>  My point is, live move on.  It just been a year.  In five year if you are going to the the grave that much, that might be a problem.  For now, it's fine.  You will fine yourself going less, as time goes on<br>  <br>  I am so sorry of the lost of your child<br>  That is the worst thing.  The second is, losing a parent when you are a child|`|gx4s68s8aa	I guess the question is how is the rest of your life going?  Are you able to basically go through your days and be O.K.  I mean I am sure you are still in mourning, but as long as you are not dwelling on your loss all the time.  Then I really don't see what is wrong with going two days a week if it is helping you cope.  We all cope differently.  And if your life is generally normal in other aspects then I see this as a healthy thing for you to do right now.  If it is not.  If you are not doing most of your regular activities, if you are not sleeping well at all etc- then perhaps there is a problem.  And then you should see a therapist.<br>  <br>  I am so sorry for your loss.  Take care.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think personally you should go as often as you want you need to deal with this in your own way. My thoughts go out to you and your family!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	You should slowly cut down on it. Because the more you go there, the memory keeps coming back..I'm sorry for your lose =[
YIb23obFaa	im sorry i dont have an answer but i had a miscarriage a couple months ago and im wondering the same thing and i could also be pregnant.<br>  <br>  people say you can get preg two weeks after but thats not the smartest thing to do because it could mess something up and make you infertile. so like you had a baby you would have to wait 6 weeks is what my doctor told me to even start having sex again. but we didnt we waited two weeks and im fine. but most women have 3 to four miscarriage in a row but can still have healthy babies. if you are ttc good luck!!!!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	No, having a miscarriage, or even two, does not make you less fertile. But having several miscarriages in a row may be a clue that you have an existing condition that is affecting your fertility, such as a genetic or uterine abnormality, fibroids or, less commonly, an infection or an auto-immune condition, such as lupus. <br>  <br>  If you've already had a miscarriage, you do have a slightly higher risk of having another one in the future, and this risk increases if you've had more than one miscarriage in the past. Many doctors believe that testing and treatment of recurrent miscarriages is not necessary until after a third pregnancy loss. However, the decision to investigate further will depend on your age and your chances of getting pregnant again. If you already know you have a condition that is linked to infertility, even one miscarriage is cause for concern and testing. <br>  <br>  It's worth getting tested because, depending on the cause of the problem, the solution can be simple. For example, women with Hughes syndrome (antiphospholipid syndrome or APS) can reduce their risk of miscarriage with a daily treatment of low dose aspirin and heparin. <br>  <br>  The cause of recurrent miscarriages is often not identified. But even where the cause cannot be found there is a good chance of carrying a successful pregnancy in the future. With support, women with a history of unexplained miscarriage have a 75% chance of having a healthy baby in the future. <br>  <br>  Miscarriage is very common and sadly affects at least 10-15 per cent of pregnancies that have been confirmed by a pregnancy test.|`|14RzmDTmaa	I had a mc on nov 5th 2008. i never got my af back, so i was put on medroxyprgesterone for 10 days at the end of jan. i had an af on feb 3rd, which means i should have ovulated on the 17th. so i'm currenlty waiting till march 1st to see if i could be pregnant. i hope all gose well with you, and good luck. also don't give up, it will happen. thats what i tell myself everyday. so good luck and god bless.|`|2HcDEQTIaa	I was 5.5 weeks pregnant in October when I had my MC.<br>  I am now 4 week pregnant and feeling healthy as can be no worries!<br>  <br>  So I guess it took me 3 months.<br>  Good luck sweetie, I will pray for you.|`|mNflBx20aa	Ok i am no medical expert, but i will say, in decmebr i had a 19 week miscarriage, but it actually happened sooner than that between my healthy 16 week appt and the 19 week appt.  I have three other healthy children and there was no cause for the miscarriage, we had a pathology work up done on the baby and he was perfect, and i had every test done under the sun and i am totally healthy, so it was deemed a medical fluke! as it happens 1 in 4  pregnancies, so i guess it was bound to happen the doctor said!!!  I opted for no D&C as i was told it is very risky and can leave scarring and damage.  so i deliverd my baby vaginally and the placenta and 28 days from delivery i had my period back, my doctor was very impressed, as some women wait 2-4 motnhs for their periods. So my body was back a month after the loss.   However since i deliverd a small baby and had no major bleeding, no tearing, no stretching,no tissue left behind.  a week later we were told to go and try again, as it would help with the mourning and the healing process.  I was told by the doc, two weeks after delivery  i am no more or less fertile and a chance of pregnancy is slim. So january i did not  detect ovualtion and had a normal period, and it was a tough pill to swallow.  I begged for ovulation, but the ovulation sticks are not good at all! and the doc swears i missed the surge for january.  so i then this month for feb, bought the clear blue easy digital ovulation predictor! worth the 30.00! and so easy to use and read! I detected ovulation and so we are offically TTC.  I have been blessed with easy fertility if there is such a thing, all 4 of my pregnancies were on the first attempt as i have very regular cycles and know ovulation. so i can time intercourse well. <br>  Since my miscarriage i have had three check ups with the doctor and he said fertility does not change after a miscarriage and should not. If before a miscarriage you had easy time conceiving that goes back, if you had difficulty conceiving that goes back too. However your fertility was before the miscarriage is how it goes back after the loss.  So fertility does depend on the procedure you had done after the miscarriage. A D&C can make fertility longer to return as the tissue all needs to regrow and heal.  If you have a normal cycle again and have tracked ovulation your fertility is totally back!!! Remember too, you only have a 20% chance of conception each month, and if you time intercourse according to ovulation your chances increase SLIGHTLY! Pregnancy and fertiltiy is an amazing thing and the scary part is the odds are against us! However if you are healthy, and taking care of yourself and avoiding caffeine and artifical sweeteners and taking a prenatal vitamin, those too increase your chances.  i am in the second month of trying and dont know if conception has happened, but i am not used to having to try as i have been blessed to conceive the first try, but too, i have undergone a traumatic event, and my body does know that, so i am just waiting now. Good luck to you!! and the thing to remember is what i was told, is when your body is ready to conceive you will be ready emotionally and vice versa!  And dont let anyone tell you when to try, you do what feel is best for you! I have through my loss, have less respect for some people who are telling me if i am ready or not!!!!! GOOD LUCK and god bless!|`|vigFmfLmaa	It can have adverse affects certainly.  Many times miscarriage and D&Cs cause scar tissue that can accumulate on the fallopian tubes or uterus and prevent pregnancy.  On the flipside many times people see quicker conception after a D&C than with the original pregnancy.  That was the case for an old co-worker who's 2nd conception only took a few months though the first took almost a year.  However, my SIL lost a baby a few years ago and she and my brother haven't had any luck conceiving since.  They are seeing a fertility doctor now.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	I had a miscarriage earlier this month. and we have already started trying again. My doctor said i should wait until I get at least one normal period but that is only b/c if i get pregnant again right away it would be easier to decipher when it happened if i had a period. I was 4 weeks along when I lost my angel. if u were further along then u should wait longer to let ur uterus heal that way u can hold a baby better. Good luck and do what u are comfortable with. There is no medical reason u cant start trying now if u like. I'm very sorry for your loss I know its hard. we were trying for 13 months. Now 14. I'm still waiting for my period but really I hope im pregnant now!
1f603110fae30efb6841a9827a36016aaa	I'm a custodial father and have a similar problem with my daughter. Though my daughter's 17 now I've learned that when she's upset  or angry it's almost always caused by some issue related to her mother. I know how stressful my situation is for me but I have to remind myself it's a lot harder for my daughter.<br>  Let your son blow off some steam and talk to him. Always let him know that your there to listen and he can discuss his frustrations with you and you will quietly listen to what he has to say.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I NEVER tell my daughter her father is coming over, unless he's on his way.  He's just too flakey I don't want her to be disapointed.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Personally if it was my choice I wouldn't let the father take him then since he is cancelling unless it only happened that one time but if he does it more then once then I just wouldn't say anything to your son that your dad is going to come get you, just see if he does then great if not then your son will not be disappointed. I don't let my ex take my daughter for the weekends, he is allowed to watch her on mondays and sometimes sundays and thursdays while im at work. Because I know that if he tells her he is going to come get her for the weekend and then doesn't then it will just hurt her and this is my way of protecting her, right or wrong that is just what I do.|`|ucVgUcDvaa	3 years olds are dramatic. Try not to get his hopes up. Kids that young can act like that even if it was Grandma. He might be picking up clues from you also.So watch how you react to these things. Let him learn from you that being calm when plans do not work out, Mom is calm.<br>  Good Luck,<br>  and hey wait till he is 18 and this will seem soooo small!|`|AA11537580	next time there is a planned visit don't tell your child the father is coming<br>  if he shows up then say surprise and if he doesn't then your child will not be disappointed.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	tell his father what happened and don't EVER EVER tell that little boy his father is coming until he pulls into the driveway|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I stopped telling my son when his father said he'd come get him, or any plans involving his dad. Don't let him know, so if the dad shows up, great, if not then you're son isn't feeling hurt by it.<br>  <br>  I eventually had enough, and just started always making up "plans," we were too busy etc. so some other time, because it's just not right for a childs father to not treat him good. Meaning, I would avoid his dad seeing him at all. BTW, my childs father doesnt pay child support, has NEVER bought him a birthday present/Christmas present, rarely calls on the actual day of my son's birthday, and is always making promises he never keeps, so I don't think it's wrong to lie to him telling him my son can't talk, he's sleeping, or we're not going to be home etc. You can't be a grown man and expect a free ride, its not gonna happen here.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	There is no reason for you to tell him if his father plans to pick him up.  Just go about your life, and keep it to yourself if the dad says he is coming.  Then if he shows up, it is a treat for him.  You are the parent, you need to take charge of this situation.  You are involving a child by giving him information that he should not have.|`|b53cPtLpaa	I would take him by the arms and say: "I know this is hard for you, but just know I always have your best intrests at heart." "Its not your fault we got divoriced and dad and me both still love you."|`|hMF3kg3Baa	When ever his a' hole father tells you that he is going to pick him up for the weekend or visit him, you should not tell your son. That way if he does show up it will be a big surprise for your son, but if he doesn't show up it wont hurt your son at all.|`|x9tOi7g7aa	I don't know what to do about him getting mad but you can avoid it by not telling him his father is coming to get him unless you are sure.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Bless your heart , I am sorry to hear that and I know it has got to be hard. <br>  My suggestion would be to stop telling your son when his father is coming until yu know for sure. That way there is no disappointment later. <br>  Also discuss with the father the tantrums you have to put up with because of him. <br>  You are doing all you can , and nothing is your fault and your son will realize this later as he matures in age. <br>  God Bless and stay strong|`|gt4VHiJ5aa	i was in the very same situation as you with my now 6yr daughter, they understand everything that goes on and the dads just expects us mothers to make it all sweet with the child for them well not no more when my daughters dad failed to show for her sixth birthday over some floozy i rang him put my daughter on the phone to him and let him hear her heartbreak... brought him to court and after a few hours he has agreed to let my now husband adopt her and stay out of her life my daughter has never been happier she knows its not her fault
KaNjj6HBaa	Yes you can still use the ovulation kit. I am using on as well with irregular periods. If you pee on the stick and it tells you that you are ovulating then you are. They detect a certain hormone that your body produces more of when you are ovulating! Good luck using it. The one I am using is the clear blue one. My only problem is that my periods are to irregular. The clear blue ovulation monitor will only count to 99 and today is day 99 for me... So it depends on how irregular you are.|`|4c747fd0be4c5e0f422ded5a0dc78cebaa	I have very irregular periods and for some reason the ovulation kits were unable to give me an accurate result. Maybe you should consult your doctor instead. Cause they might be able to direct you to a good brand.|`|0DquWttZaa	yes u can because in many cases ovulation occurs with out period so using a ovulation kit can help u to find out the right time to conceive...hope it helps.<br>  but try to use the clear blue ovulation kit coz many people recommended me to use the clear blue one they says its accurate... and do not use the answer rand it terrible.good luck baby dust.
7VJcd5YLaa	We went through this too - it is not easy - but you both will survive it!<br>  <br>  What I did with older daughter - we clipped the end of the nipple off (we did the throw away and she fished it out of the trash) and let her have it.  We did it gradually (clip off more and more) so that she would eventually just have the shield & stub of a nipple left - which she slept with for a few months of transition.<br>  <br>  My younger daughter had similar issues - we clipped hers and then took it to Build A Bear and put it inside the animal of her choice.  <br>  <br>  There is the Paci Fairy who comes to take the paci away for a new baby - you can tie it to a balloon and let it go - you can give her something new to celebrate being a big girl.<br>  <br>  Give her a new fuzzy of blanket - etc.  A good book about giving up a childhood security object is "Owen" by Kevin Henkes - we love it.<br>  <br>  We did a big Girl Party and had a No More Sucker Cake, a few gifts, etc.<br>  <br>  You an go cold turkey, but I could not do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck - you can find the right mixture.|`|HWiuRgNxaa	have you tried to cut a whole in it? my son didn't lose his until we was almost three. then one of my friends said i will take you to get a toy if you give me your "binky" and he did. my daughter however wouldn't give up the bottle. lol. i just took it away and let her cry. it was sad but she has an overbite now and i wish i would have taken it away sooner. good luck!okay i see you did cut it off. i say bribe bribe bribe.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I think this is the problem. Stop trying to pull it away from her and stop making a big deal out of it. She won't be walking around with a pacifier at 13. Just take good care of her teeth. Reverse phycology works, so she will likely give it up pretty soon on her own.|`|AA12205301	Really the best way is to just throw it out. And not buy anymore. Yes she will cry, but crying never killed anyone.  Let her cry. She'll get over it.  Kids are resilient. You have to be the parent and the one who is the boss. Take it, throw it away in a garbage not at home so you arent tempted to get it out. Have you mom take them with her or something. It needs to be done. And substituting something else doesn't work either, it is substituting one habit for another.  Just like getting rid of bottles, throw it out. Do not give in to the tears. Or better yet, do not get them started on the habits to start with. I have 3 children and not one of them had a pacifier ever. They are all normal. I have been reading the other answers and all I see is them telling you to replace the pacifier with something else that she will get hooked on and you will have to try to break her from that too. They are saying take away the pacifier but give a blanket or stuffed animal that she can attach to and you will have to break her from that for school. NO sense to me.  Take it and don't get her hooked on something else to replace it.|`|CxCigxZIaa	Well....this is what 'we' did. (my daughter and I)<br>  I didn't make a huge deal out of it first of all (with my daughter)<br>  I gotta say that this is NOT EASY at all.<br>  It's going to hurt YOU more than her...trust me.<br>  Take the paci and HIDE it. HIDE THEM ALL.<br>  When she can't find it then you help her. DO not lie to her, but just help her look for it.<br>  When you can't find it then you act like you are on the phone to the store and ask this (on the phone) "excuse me...do you have any more paci's for my daughter?" (make sure she's hearing you) then you say, "No..well what can we have instead of a paci?" turn to her and let her know that there are no more paci's but the store will give her whatever she wants instead. Remember she's two. <br>  You are going to have to follow through with this. <br>  FINAL NOTE: She will cry and it might be for 3 - 4 nights before she realizes there REALLY is no more paci's. I know it sounds horrible to do it this way, but if YOU really want her to stop then YOU have to stop it. <br>  YOU must toss out all paci's and bottles (so you can rig up a paci)<br>  You can't give in.<br>  On another note: I've seen older children than her use paci's - most of them toss them on their own. <br>  However if you are going to do it then do it..don't start doing it then stop. BIG MISTAKE.|`|d7kGopYxaa	Have you tried juice or milk??<br>  HM-MM OK. What if you went to toy r us and got her a a little stuffed animal. Let her choose b4 u tell her anything. Let her get attached the the animal at the store and ten tell her the deal. If she wants the stuffed animal pacifier goes bye bye. Or just throw all the pacifiers away and get her the stuffed animal( her choose) telling her that thi is her buddy for worse or for better. Well then ask the pediatrician.|`|QRV20RS3aa	My brother and his wife just had the same problem with my little niece.  She didn't want to give it up, so they went to the Build a Bear store with her and let her make her own teddy bear with the pacifier inside of the bear.  She was obviously allowed to sleep, play, and take her pacifier with her wherever and whenever she wanted.  As long as she knew it was in the bear, she was ok with giving it up.  Maybe that could work for you?|`|xXMUyCalaa	find her something else, my bf's sister had the same problem with her baby, of course eventually she will get over it but maybe finding something else for her to have as a comfort type thing, or if u could find something else she can have in her mouth, there are tons of things out there|`|Eyhq5k5Faa	maybe you could try and replace it with something else she would love. my daughter loves her lamby she carries around everywhere. just a thought. hope something works for you!|`|RKbxxjJuaa	My Aunt and Uncle sugessted something as I was where you are when my now 7 year old was (shudder) almost 3 and still wanting the paci whenver she was tired.  This is what I did, and it worked AMAZINGLY!!  On Christmas Eve, my daughter left her pacis on the fireplace mantle for a child in the North Pole that didn't have any and in return Santa was going to leave her an extra special toy!  She went to bed that night, and got up about 45 minutes later asking for it, I had already at this point taken it and trashed it (thank God) and I told her that Santa had already stopped by and taken it, and that if she went right to sleep like a big girl, he'd be back with her "special toy".  I don't even remember what the "special toy" was because she got so much that Christmas, but she never asked for her paci again.  I think she was ready just needed the nudge.  My daughter is extremely selfless and since she was old enough to interact, would give up the toy she was playing with to make another child happy.  I think that's why this worked so well.  She knew someone needed it more than she did!  Try to appeal to your little one's personality.  If she is intrigued with the mail, package it up and have a "mail away party" if she is into dogs (my daughter LOVES animals) tell her that you are going to play doggie for a whold day, and "doggie's don't use pacis".  If she's ready you won't have an issue.  My aunt and uncle did it around Easter and had my cousin leave her paci in the easter basket and the Easter bunny "magically" turned the pacis into chocolate.  If you can do it in a fun way as opposed to a "your not having this anymore way" I think you'll be more successful!  Child psychology 101! LOL!  Good luck!!|`|tht0DrHsaa	Oh I know exactly what you are going through.  My son is 2 1/2 and is totally hooked on his.  He always has it.  My doctor told me that I will know when he is ready to give it up and just to wait till then.  I don't want him to take it to prom with him when he is 17 so I am stressed about it to.  To top it all off he has no interest in potty training either.  He is perfectly happy in a pull up.  When I put him in underwear he will just pee in them and wear it he doesn't care a bit.  So I may have a teenager that still wears pull up and takes a binki.  Oh well at least they are healthy and happy right?
jf9PFy0Yaa	For my daughter's first we just had a small family get together, had pizza cake and ice cream. I didn't really decorate just a few balloons, it was relativly cheap as well I would say under $50.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	For our kids first few birthdays, we just had the family get together. The grandmother, uncles who were in the area.  They all paid attention to the kids, and brought gifts.  I fixed a nice dinner, cake and ice cream, and took lots of pictures.  <br>  <br>  Got a picture of each child trying on her/his own to deal with a nice piece of chocolate cake.  Messy, but enjoyable.  After all, babies do wash up well.|`|GOYk4SYqaa	I have two daughters one is 5 and the other is 1 1/2 i always have a big celebration for my girls because now is the best time when they get older there gonna want to go out with there friends or have a party of there own this is the most precious time of there life .

WPI0Z47saa	That is pretty early to be having symptoms. You normally wouldn't get much until you are 3-6 weeks pregnant. You may be but you will have to wait to take your test. But just based on that it sounds like you just want this really bad. Good luck.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	take a preggo test then|`|WLNX00c3aa	taking a home preg test is the best way to find out. some of the symptoms you describe could also be PMS.<br>  <br>  good luck. hope you are!!|`|m2ow8mbwaa	Take A Pregnancy Test.|`|9FrBtCfDaa	....get a test|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Sounds like you could be pregnant. I don't want to get your hopes up though. Sometimes are bodies just change and they play tricks on us. I know what you're going through though. I remember that while we were trying I would always think that I had some sort of pregnancy symptom and I would get so excited and then I would take a test and it was negative. Just take a test asap so that you don't have to keep wondering and getting more and more excited. I really hope this is your month and it happens for you. Good luck and god bless you!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	It sounds a little soon, but since you are trying it could be. You must no the drill though wait till your missed period. At one point I thought I was pregnant and even with neg. test I was convinced that I was pregnant - well period showed and I was not. I even started getting a belly - your mind does weird things. When I found out I was pregnant I didn't even have any symptoms till after my missed period.|`|bGRexKPyaa	That clear slippery discharge could just be his sperm...|`|SJEqXq21aa	TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST!!!!!!!!|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Take a test.|`|SNqFxleiaa	go to a doctor to see if ur preggo|`|8AKVf9Igaa	I know what you are going through.  We were trying for 4 or 5 months before I became pregnant and every month I found reasons why I thought I was pregnant.  Tender breasts (which happens before my normal cycle anyway), discharge, hunger, moodiness, I just wanted it so bad.  It wasn't until I was disappointed month after month and gave up the guessing game that I finally was pregnant.  If you are, congrats, and if you aren't I'm sure it will happen soon.  Just wait until the first day of your missed period to take the test, before that its not 100% accurate anyway.  Good Luck!
vigFmfLmaa	I've heard of couples doing that.  I don't think it's a bad idea in general but for us it would be.  My husband can't keep a secret for anything!|`|PpYBnxgpaa	I think that is a great idea . Good luck and I am sure you'll have a beautiful baby no matter the sex|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Bahahahaha!!! Good luck with that one! I will be really, really surprised if you don't somehow end up finding out before the baby is born. Even if it's something as innocent as an accidental slip, you hear him talking to someone on the phone or you run across something he'd bought. My husband wants to know the sex of our baby and I don't and no way would I let him know and expect him to contain his enthusiasm about it for the rest of the pregnancy. He can wait like the rest of the world. Then we'll ALL know soon enough.|`|QqFPNti4aa	You both need to be on the same page.  And you will be eventually tempted to look for the clothes.  If you can't agree on the small things now. Then how will you agree on the bigger things later.  I think not knowing and knowing both have their advantages you just need to come together on this.|`|Xg60yW10aa	i don't see why it would be a bad idea. just don't get too upset if he slips or you find out somehow.
YkseyT7zaa	M&Ms as a reward worked for my daughter|`|pbrfZQ53aa	When it comes to potty training its best to start off young. The best method is the Fido-Potty Training Technique. When they poop or pee in their diaper or have a night time accident in their bed you take them and rub their nose in it. Then forcefully, showing a hint of dominance, yell "NO! NO!" Swatting their thighs and/or nose with a rolled up newspaper is optional but can get tricky if authorities get involved. Its best to instruct the child, if he is of speaking age, to automatically answer the question with the "I fell"-response thus alleviating you from lawful consequences or responsibility.|`|02FZuqQ5aa	My son turned 3 in January and only went on the potty now and then.  We tried a lot of different methods, stickers, snacks, etc.  One thing that started to work was to put a cheerio in the toilet and tell him to pee on it since the potty monster is hungry.  He was excited about that, but it wore off.  Finally I found something that is working pretty well.  My son loves to play educational pc games.  Now we don't let him play until he goes potty.  He has to earn his time.  Now when he goes, he gets to play for 15 minutes.  And now he goes even more often than he probably needs to, just so he can play more.  If your cousin doesn't play games, maybe you could use educational cartoon time as a bribe instead.  I think its the best of both worlds... their learning to use the potty, plus they get to learn new educational things :)|`|J5TbYvVZaa	I started a week ahead of time telling my son (28mo) that he was going to get to go potty in 7 days. We counted down- everyday reminding him that in X days he was going to get to go potty. On the day before we started, I let him help me color a potty chart and let him pick out the stickers for it. We even went to the store to pick out what treats he wanted. I also had him help me put things in his 'potty box' - puzzles, books, trucks that went in the bathroom. I had already purchased underwear and put them in his drawer - where he could reach. On the morning of the big day, we put all his diapers in a box for the baby (his little brother) and took them out of his room. We used a timer the first few days, so he knew that when the timer went off we were heading to the potty. We bought a child urinal - Peter Potty. We had both pottys in there and told him he could pick which one he wanted to use.(The urinal won't work for you but maybe get a toddler seat for the 'big potty' and have that and a little potty.) The first couple days were accident after accident. When he asked for a diaper, I reminded him they were gone. By day 4 he was accident free. We did dances and sang songs when he went. He also got to call daddy, grandmas, friends when he went. He really thought that was neat. We put on 'nite nite pants' (goodnights pullups) and never said diaper again. The other thing I did was keep a log of when he would go to the bathroom and by day 7 we were out and about because I could schedule small errands around his potty schedule. I know all kids are different but I think it really helped him that he was involved in everything and felt like he was making the choice! Good luck and be consistant.|`|sMlNvnxmaa	Ok with my kids i just took them to the bathroom like every 5 or 10 minutes even if they didn't have to go within 1 week they were potty trained.|`|dqbEVI5maa	Well dont put a pull up on er that seems to be a set back, she willl go when she's good and ready too.|`|ksi4IZQZaa	I read a book to my son over and over again to get him into a routine. It was called "tinkle, tinkle when you go to the potty" By Heather Knickerbocker-Silva (on amazon, or other book store sites or www.binkyfairyandmore.com) and it repeats a cute little verse over and over about peeing, sitting to poop, wiping, etc. It shows picture of children that are relatable. Try it. It worked for us!
GWveqx61aa	if she is constipated you should try caro syrup, the dark kind, my sister uses that for her babies and it works great, but about your question, i think it should clear up by itself,  not sure though, id call your pediatrition _good luck_
oiJITSNZaa	Sorry not at all effective. It shouldn;t even be considered a means of birthcontrol because really it isn't.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	a small amount of semen still leaks out before he ejaculates, so if he's inside without protection, there's a chance to get pregnant.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Be prepaired for an "accident" at any time.  Not at all a reliable method.|`|aGYvN9pfaa	Its not very effective at all. Before a man officially ejaculates, he can have whats termed "pre-***" which is a small amount of lubrication that leaks out before he fully climaxes. Although it's diluted, it does contain some sperm in it. I know of at least 2 people who had unplanned pregnancies (that, unfortunately, unlike you, they were unprepared for) because they used the pull-out method.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Not very.  If you don't mind getting pregnant have at it.  But if I wanted to avoid pregnancy there's no way I'd depend on this method.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It is not effective at all. That's how I ended up pregnant. Don't trust it.|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Not very effective.  But ur married and already have a baby so a little "whoops" wouldn't be too bad!|`|a76728313dc8f0da3cb0cd4227b335beaa	It's not effective at all if you are trying to prevent pregnancy.  condoms work well.|`|BkEMUj58aa	It seems to work ok for me.  No kids yet!!
Ccq8zEcnaa	I really don't think it'll be all that bad. Yeah you're mom will likely be really upset and disappointed in you, but you can't keep waiting. The longer you wait the longer you are deceiving her.. and that might make her more upset. You will have to tell her, and explain to her how you will take on this new responsibility. You will have to be mature about it and let her see how you know you made a mistake.|`|v3LnJycKaa	in most states she cant just kick you out on the street, and if she does you can go to the local transitional assistance office and file they will get you into temp housing until they can help find a better place, you are still legally a minor and her kicking you out with no other place to go is child neglect and abuse.|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	I know it's tough but you have to just tell her and beg for mercy. <br>  Sorry and good luck|`|vigFmfLmaa	You're about to be responsible for another human being and you think the hard part is telling dear old mom???  Just tell her.  She's going to know eventually.  At least telling her now means she won't be extra upset you hid it from her for so long later on.  Have you considered abortion or adoption?  There are options and you don't have to keep a baby you can't provide for.  That's unfair to the child.|`|KYvlD9o9aa	test first sweetheart... then if its positive just sit her down and tell her. She most likely will not throw you out because she is your mother and her motherly instincts will kick it. IF you are pregnant then once you have your child you will know why your mother says these things. Good luck! P.S. i don't criticize you for having sex at 16, because I did the same thing. Just keep in mind the consequences and practice safe sex!!!|`|afeNK6oSaa	Pray about it, talk to other people who will support you before you talk to her.|`|3KoGUAfLaa	If you were grown up enough to have sex knowing the consequences, you need to be grown up enough to face possibly having to move out. Welcome to the real world, it sucks. If not, there are always organizations to help out teens in your situation. Do a little research, start coming up with backup plans just in case your mom actually does kick you out. Good luck!!|`|SJqgoGPUaa	Well she is going to find out either way. And your mother out of all people should be there for you rather then threaten you. First who got you pregnant? See if he can give you the option of staying with him. Second your mom legally cannot kick you out, she has to go through the courts to do that, your a minor and she is your mother. the only way she can legally kick you out is if, you have a job and enough money to support yourself. And if you have a place to live. Also if it is in the best interest of the minor child. Expecially if your having a baby ! it will be even harder.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Just tell her , the longer you wait the more disappointed she will be. <br>  Alot of moms say that "if you get pregnant you move out" but more than half of the moms that say that do not mean it. They just do not want to see you struggle. She's not going to be mad just disappointed and shocked more than anything. Just suck it up and tell her. You already know the worst that can happen so prepare for that. But I doubt it will. Tell her ASAP ! Good Luck hun|`|lHjXeN8oaa	i am sure that your mom might have used that as a scare tactic to keep you from doing things that she would rather you not.  honesty is the best policy - better to just tell her and get it over with.  You might talk to a school counselor or another trusted adult and see what they suggest... There are organizations to help young mothers who have no where to turn.  i have a lot of respect for you simply because you realized you made a mistake and can admit it.  There are many adults who can't even do this.  Best of luck to you.|`|3LTrcLzKaa	I think you should go ahead and tell her, it is better for her to find out now than later. In my past experiences, I've found it's better for moms to know what's going on. I know it will be scary, but she is your mom. Good luck with everything.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	Ok, Well if you felt responsible enough to go and have Sex, then you can be responsible enough to tell your momma!
w5y4BTjkaa	YES! She didn't text back because she thought that you didn't care enough to call her and break it off. F.Y.I, texting a girl to call off a date is really mean, next time call her (it would have worked out soooo much better). I think you should call her and appologise, tell her why you had to miss, and tell her that you really care about her and want to start all over. She won't be able to resist your cuteness, sensitivity, and love for her (I wasn't). Arrange for a nice, romantic dinner and then take her out for a movie or frozen yogurt or something cool and cute like that. I would go walk around an open mall or a park at night. Something fun and romantic! I hope it works and I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Um wrong section. And a  text blow-off is very rude, you should have called. Call and apologize and if you're lucky she'll forgive you.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	First, baby names is not the group for this question.<br>  <br>  Second, sure, text her back or myspace her just one more time. She probably thought you blew her off. Just say you're sorry again, something unexpected popped up and ask her to go to a movie again.<br>  <br>  Good luck and you should've posted this in the dating category
Ccq8zEcnaa	I gained nine pounds in my sixth month. In my fifth I gained 7lbs. Other than that my weight gain has been like 2lbs here, three there.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	The last two months definately.

But I was REALLY underweight.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Well so far (I'm 25 weeks)....this past month I gained 6 lbs...totaling at 23lbs to date...<br>  I packed on a quite a few in the beginning since I was so nauseous and all I could tolerate was mashed potatoes!|`|mAxChwHTaa	7-8 i gained 10 lbs.... i only gained 22 lbs overall..|`|wb781QEzaa	around the 5th month when the baby was doing most of her growing
sbeoF50gaa	um why would you even have kids if you were just going to let someone else raise them???|`|nVQGpvuoaa	My parents used to never be home.<br>  And I seriously rarely talk to them.<br>  I'll have real conversations once in a while but other than that no.<br>  Maybe just  a year or two ago they actually started to do things with me and my brother. Me and my brother used to have a nanny kinda person...but eh. I think it just makes the child not respect you as much as a child should respect their parents. And the child will just "use" you for money.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I didn't have a nanny but my parents worked non-stop and missed out on everything and I hated that and now I know I will not put my child through that.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	A nanny?  I did not have my son so that I could ignore him and never find out who he really is!  I am a working parent, but I am also the one getting up at 3 am with him.  Why?  Because that is what I signed up for when I decided to become his mother!|`|BPuyPpNkaa	No, having "more things" doesn't make up for absent parents.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	all the children i know that have nanny's are bratty and seem slightly depressed and anxious.
EOaAQVdSaa	Pregnancy tests indicate the presence of a hormone your body produces only when pregnant. There is a chance the test was faulty. I'd buy another one. I recommend Answer Home Pregnancy Test, it's inexpensive and as accurate as any other test, and take the test in the morning, the first time you pee when you wake up, when the hormone is at it's most concentrated in the urine. If that's also a negative, it could be something else, so I'd go see the obgyn.
Ccq8zEcnaa	Some women experience cramping similar to PMS in early pregnancy. In your case though, I would wait until next week to see if your period starts. If not, then take a test and see what it says.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It is possible. Cramping in early pregnancy is normal. Just wait another week and see if you get your period. If you don't take a test! Good luck!|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Sometimes when your pregnant you still have symptoms of your period.|`|zBz10IiOaa	yes hun you would cramps are a part of pregnancy and you get them alot in pregnancy just not intense|`|NV5CQU8Taa	yes, but these are just cramps from the embrio settling in.|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	yes you can however if you are not sure if you are pregnant it could be your period.
sxecXFgraa	If you are a single parent in any branch of the military, you will have to fill out a family care plan.  This plan states who will be responsible for your child(ren) if you were to get deployed.  As a single parent, you still will be required to work your shift (either 8 hours or 12 hours depending on your duty station) and you may still go overseas.  You can bring dependents (spouse or children) with you to most overseas locations.  You do not automatically get out just because you are a single parent.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Yea why wouldn't there be?|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Yes, I had a friend that was a single mother and she was in the Air Force.|`|AA11106675	Yes, but it doesn't stop you from getting transferred or serving overseas or in wartime.
WOHc22Xiaa	If you stop taking the pill you can get pregnant right after.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You might want to take a test to be sure. You never know you could have gotten pregnant while you were still on the pill too.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Most likely it is you getting off the pill, but I was off birth control for one month & I got pregnant. So it is possible. So My last period was Nov. 21 and I didn't use birth control after that and my missed period came in Dec. and December 25th I found out I was pregnant. SO it is possible.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	probably a side effect...after being on the pill your boody is used to you having controlled periods..and now that your off, your body is confused an djust spits aout a peroid when ever now....i'll be ok..<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm TTC too...my hubbgy is leaving for iraq may 1st so we have 10 days to concieve....<br>  <br>  good luck though!!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	That sounds like there is a good chance that you may be pregnant! I was the same way with my boobs also hurting bad as my first signs...|`|LY2LSzPJaa	When you first get off the pill you are more prone then to get pregnant , so you very wll good be <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|SJqgoGPUaa	Ohh yea there is. even if you skip one day you can get pregnant. im about 7-8 weeks pregnant and i started feeling those syptoms right away!! literally.

lkhCeAdJaa	Yeah, I often want to be a stay at home dad;-)|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I worked full time until my son was born and I thought it would be the greatest thing to stay home all day. Now that I'm home all day with no adult interaction I would love to go back to work but don't want to leave my son. So, yes, the grass is always greener on the other side.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	UGH no my neighbors' grass is all dirt, ours has been winterized! :P<br>  <br>  At times I wish I could go back to work, but its abit late for me now. Since I can't really find my feet. ( few more months to go ) But then, I feel like no I don't, I can't think of anyone or place that could take care of my child/ren like I do . I love staying at home more. And we are somewhat blessed to have just enough income coming in to do so. Could use more. I think after the girls get older, I will venture back out into the whole job world, even if its a 4 hr job at a coffee shop. lol.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	how about this - <br>  the grass is always greener on the other side but it still needs to be cut<br>  pure genius i know.  ;-)|`|prqrQcd1aa	yes, i do have days where the grass looks greener on the other side, as does my boyfriend who is the "bread winner" right now.<br>  <br>  It gets even harder when I do start working during the season when the motel i work at is open, because I can't afford day care and can take my kids to work with me...so in my position it's like i'm working taking care of kids, and working to make an earning! (But it's also easier this way because I don't have to worry about sitters, day care fee's and so on and so forth!)|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Yes, I would SAH with Colten in a heartbeat if grass grew on trees. I look into things like "work at home" but they all turn out to want money up front (that I don't have) or be scams.<br>  <br>  I would love nothing more then to SAH with my son and I wish people in this section would stop judging me because I work at home. Saying things like "I cant even bear the though to put my son with strangers" directly through email to me, I can't help it ok?

This was done out of necessity initially but eventually it was the only thing that really worked well.<br>  <br>  If you are still wanting another co-sleeper I know that there are some out on the market that don't have any base so that baby can use it freely at any age.  Google co-sleepers and see what you find.  Good luck.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Arms Reach makes both compact and full size co-sleepers that accommodate babies up to 50 pounds.

Our daughter always slept flat on the mattress and we just each had our own blanket so it couldn't cover her face between us.  We also used small throw pillows instead of full sized ones.  When she got too big to be comfortable in bed with us, we pulled the crib up to the side of the bed and removed the side rail.  I stuffed towels in the crack between the beds and pushed the beds tightly against the wall, so the crib was sandwiched tightly between our bed and the wall.  There was no way for her to slip down.  This gave her space to sleep in her own area but she could still easily come over for nursing or snuggles when needed.
G1ZgTqNcaa	You do not want to overdo it, and if you are considered underweight, you should also limit your working out.  I had ttc for 13 months, but was underweight.  I would run a few miles a few times a week.  I stopped working out as much, but my doctor said as long as you do it in moderation, then it should not affect your changes of ttc.  You need to be healthy in order to get pregnant, so as long as you do not over do it and you feel comfortable working out, then it should not be a problem.
LeY6hx4Laa	i am also 8 weeks pregnant and was only moaning the other day that i don't feel pregnant at all and was worried, i woke up few days ago and feel very sick and since then i can only eat soup! wish i didn't moan now, but i have been eating a few ginger biscuits before i get up in the morning and makes me feel a little better, also i know i shouldn't drink much of it because of the caffeine but i find sipping cold coke or lemonade helps too, good luck!|`|bzQNHfunaa	gingerale<br>  ginger root (make a tea)<br>  crackers<br>  bread<br>  flav water<br>  hard candies<br>  breathing<br>  gettin ur mind off it|`|61wXpXVxaa	Ginger ale, taking your prenatal vitamins at night instead of the morning,|`|YiDhb60Paa	i got morning once in awhile. i would try eatting prezetals|`|wvGv8WQ6aa	I am 7 1/2 weeks and I was getting sick allll the time.. my doctor just put me on medicine and now i have none! morning sickness is all gone. the medicine is extremely expensive though (600 dollars for 30 pills) my doctor only put me on it though because i was on the verge of being hospitalized because i was getting dehydrated :(|`|i8Ch743Laa	Ginger ale helped me tons.
OLW0Irbhaa	I've been on a BPA kick lately and one of the things I read about pumps is that the milk isn't in contact for that long so it's not considered problematic.  So you are fine to keep what you've got.  But like you've figured you don't want to reheat the bottles or store the milk in them.  I bought glass just for reheating purposes.  And don't worry.  There has been limited exposure.  I've been trying to look at the overall picture and decrease my children's exposure when I can.|`|ROJans2Taa	I had a an avent breast pump, that I assume had BPA in it as well, I never replaced, I really dont think any or much BPA would get into the milk, not if your not heating it, just transfer the milk to a BPA free bottle, the majority of BPA leakage occurs over time and through heating. I have since stopped pumping and only use BPA free everything regarding my baby, but my first was born in 2001, well before any alarms sounded off on this whole thing, and she was bottle fed from 3 mths and we always heated the bottles in the microwave, she is 7 and seems perfectly healthy, I just take the precautions now because theres so many BPA free items now, my advice, dont worry about the pump. Best luck and Congrats

Ccq8zEcnaa	All that caffeine isn't good because it affects the fetal heart-rate. And too much caffeine accelerates the heart beat, and too much acceleration over time in the fetus causes stress, thus miscarriage. I would just avoid caffeine from here on out, or at least limit yourself to as little as possible.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Not recconmended|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You are allowed to have caffeine every day, you just can't have more than 200mg of it per day.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Yes, studies have linked over 200 mg of caffeine to a higher risk of miscarriage. Just try to cut back - one cup of coffee or one soda. Don't stop all at once because then you could go through withdrawal headaches, etc, and be miserable. Gradually cut back until you no longer need it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe-to-have-my-morning-cup-of-coffee-during-pregnancy_1246893.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe...</a>|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	Yes that is true.  That is why if you think you are pregnant you should significantly decrease your caffiene intake, or limit it altogether during the first few months. You should take a test and see your doctor if the test is positive.  Good luck!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Hey there. I was told 200mg to 300mg a day is fine in pregnancy. I drank Caffine like no one's business before I knew I was pregnant. I have cut back to 2 to 3 times a week. Don't worry. It's like alcohol, excessive amounts do misscarriage type damage.|`|P7tue78Aaa	Yes, women who consume 200mg of caffeine or more a day have a higher miscarriage risk. The link is the caffeine itself, it's a drug. To play it safe you should avoid caffeine entirely during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the likelihood of miscarriage. Daily caffeine intake of more than four to seven cups of coffee a day appears to double the risk of spontaneous miscarriage. <br>  <br>  You should stop consuming so much for now and take a pregnancy test to confirm your pregnancy. If you're pregnant (yay!!) then you can stop consuming so much or stop entirely. My doctor told me it's okay in moderate amounts. She said I can drink a coke a day and be fine but I decided to really limit myself (it's just a personal choice of mine).|`|1UrMbDZHaa	since women are most likely to miscarry in the first 3 months of their pregnancy it is vital to be as healthy as you can. which means to cut down the caffeine. yes it can cause miscarriage. but having a little bit doesn't hurt. i really mean little. it can also affect the growth of your baby. just take a test to make sure. if you are i strongly recommend not drinking any caffeine, but at least cut back. you can have a bit more towards the end. be careful for your baby's sake (and yours) if you are in fact pregnant. believe me its not easy. i'm used to drinking nothing but sodas till i found out i was pregnant at 3 weeks then a cut back and have a few sips occasionally.|`|ICGxM45qaa	Yeah, it's generally not a good idea to take addictive drugs when pregnant, and Caffeine certainly falls into that category.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	you'll be fine as long as you cut back for now. I cut back for the first 3 months to about a can a day of soda now I drink about 2 or so and its perfectly fine. I've been told that by 3 different doctors in different states.|`|1aHchY9raa	STOP DRINKING CAFFEIN ITS A DRUG.<br>  well slow it down at least.. perhaps one cup a day.. if that<br>  and start eating healthy.|`|cpuydZvNaa	i do not think so,but ask your doctor that you usally go see for check ups but i really do not think so ya
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	my daughter is 14 months and i still feed on demand, which includes the night. its true they dont *need* it. they arent gonna die without it.  but id rather go by her schedule than mine. it makes for a happier baby|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Even if he doesn't need it he may still just really like the comfort it provides. There is nothing wrong with it. If he wants to night feed I'd just let him. My son is nine months and he feeds at least two or three times a night. He's never really been hungry first thing in the morning either. Although I think that's because about an hour before he wakes up he nurses like crazy in his sleep. I swear he does not want to waste any time feeding once he is awake! lol.|`|bxlYleZkaa	They will wake if they are hungry or uncomfortable and sometimes of course if they dream. If he doesnt ask don't offer & he may sleep right through before long.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	There should be no debate! Children need to be fed when they are hungry, end of story.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	My daughter is the same way with her night feeds and seems to get the majority of her milk calories during the night.  Some days she also doesn't eat right when she wakes up, she started doing that around 7-8 months.  She never changed her pattern with night feeds though and is now 11 months.  It may or may not mean he nutritionally needs the night feed but comfort-wise he probably will need it for some time.<br>  <br>  You can always try to comfort him another way when he night wakes and see his reaction. He may surprise you and fall right back to sleep - he'll let you know if he really needs to nurse.  Elyse usually will throw herself back in the nursing position if I try and just hold and rock her...|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Arguably milk transfer isn't the primary purpose of breastfeeding.  So whether or not a baby NEEDS to take in calories or water at night is only a small part of whether they should be allowed to nurse.<br>  <br>  Yes SOME breastfed babies can go 8-12 hours without food, however its not optimal for most moms and babies.  Not nursing that long can cause plugged ducts, mastitis, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepthrough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...</a><br>  The same is true of sleeping. Human children are designed to be sleeping with their parents. The sense of touch is the most important sense to primates, along with sight. Young primates are carried on their mother's body and sleep with her for years after birth, often until well after weaning. The expected pattern is for mother and child to sleep together, and for child to be able to nurse whenever they want during the night. Normal, healthy, breastfed and co-sleeping children do not sleep "through the night" (say 7-9 hours at a stretch) until they are 3-4 years old, and no longer need night nursing. I repeat -- this is NORMAL and HEALTHY. Dr. James McKenna's research on co-sleeping clearly shows the dangers of solitary sleeping in young infants, who slip into abnormal patterns of very deep sleep from which it is very difficult for them to rouse themselves when they experience an episode of apnea (stop breathing). When co-sleeping, the mother is monitoring the baby's sleep and breathing patterns, even though she herself is asleep. When the baby has an episode of apnea, she rouses the baby by her movements and touch. This is thought to be the primary mechanism by which co-sleeping protects children from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In other words, many cases of SIDS in solitary sleeping children are thought to be due to them having learned to sleep for long stretches at a time at a very early age, so they find themselves in these deep troughs of sleep, then they may experience an episode of apnea, and no one is there to notice or rouse them from it, so they just never start breathing again. Co-sleeping also allows a mother to monitor the baby's temperature during the night, to be there if they spit up and start to choke, and just to provide the normal, safe environment that the baby/child has been designed to expect. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/comfortnursing.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/comf...</a><br>   Many moms feel guilty for nursing their baby to sleep. Nursing your baby to sleep is not a bad thing to do! It's very normal and developmentally appropriate for babies to nurse to sleep and to wake 1-3 times during the night for the first year or so. Some babies don't do this, but they are the exception, not the rule. Many children, if given the choice, prefer to nurse to sleep through the second year and beyond. Nursing is obviously designed to comfort baby and to help baby sleep, and I've never seen a convincing reason why mothers shouldn't use this wonderful "tool" that we've been given.<br>  <br>  "You are not a pacifier; you are a Mom. You are the sun, the moon, the earth, you are liquid love, you are warmth, you are security, you are comfort in the very deepest aspect of the meaning of comfort.... but you are not a pacifier!" -- Paula Yount<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsuck.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsuck.ht...</a><br>  I don't think breastfeeding is "just" about feeding the baby, any more than sex is "just" about creating babies. Breastfeeding the baby does provide food, and water. It also provides immunological factors, which may be what the baby is after (and why they nurse so often when sick, not just for comfort). The process of breastfeeding itself also regulates the baby's temperature and heart rate and lowers its blood pressure, and puts it to sleep. And then of course there are all those important social and emotional factors going on during the exchange. Dr. Blackburn's research on the evolution of mammary glands suggests that the original purpose of "lacteal fluids" was to kill germs in the offspring's gastro-intestinal tract and protect it from infections, and the nutritive components of breast milk only evolved later. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/4mo-sleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/4mo-...</a><br>  But WAIT! Someone told the mother that the baby can't possibly be hungry -- just let him cry it out. Now mom's milk supply diminishes because punkin isn't eating well during the day -- too many things going on, and he's going through some new developmental stages (when Hildegarde is learning something new, she doesn't nurse as well until the new skill is mastered). IF mom has kept Buford/Hildegarde on a schedule since day 1, then she will probably NOT be able to increase her supply -- not with pumping, not with herbs. If she fed her baby frequently enough and laid down enough prolactin receptors in the first two weeks to a month, there is hope that we can bring the milk back up. But if she was truly "obeying" a schedule and only feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours, she may not be able to (depending on mom's breastmilk storage supplies, etc).<br>  <br>  Why don't bottle feeding|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	Babies get very clever at that age and there is a school of thought that says that they wake up for the comfort of the feed rather than because they are hungry, as to what you continue to do it's up to you, he's your son.<br>  <br>  For the record, my 3 children have all been different with their night routines.|`|TAGQ4FQQaa	just go with the flow with your baby, at this age they grow so fast, they eat and sleep more when they grow, maybe he doesnt "need" the milk but hey who doesnt wake up hungry from time to time? my son is 13months and i still give him milk in the night if he wants it! i just tell myself its not forever!|`|Xc02z608aa	It is possible.  Try to not night feed him tonight and see what happens.  <br>  <br>  My 9 month old son still night feeds and wants breakfast very soon after waking up.  I don't think there is a set age limit.  It depends on the baby.|`|AA10888290	He may not NEED it, but there's nothing wrong with it.  My 16 mo old still nurses once a night if she wakes up.  Sometimes I get thirsty, so I imagine she does too.  Tell your friend to mind her own business.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Some do, some don't.<br>  <br>  My daughter who is now 9 months wouldn't eat.  Point black refused to eat.  Up until this week she has been having up to 24oz in the night.  No this week she has been eating (thank god!) and is down to 10-16oz at night.<br>  <br>  Some babies are hungry though the night, just like adults and sometimes they just want a drink.  I wake up at night for a drink sometimes and I imagine my daughter is doing the same.<br>  <br>  Some could have medical conditions that mean they need feeding also.<br>  <br>  I say, each to their own and personally I'll be feeding my daughter until she stops waking up for it!<br>  <br>  My guess, your son does need the feed in the night and he's just not hungry in the morning.  Maybe he can only go a certain amount of time before he's hungry and he hasn't reached that point by morning.  It's up to you if you stop the feed or not, but personally, i'd continue.|`|AA11065140	Wow.  I think it's rather presumptuous of her to decide what nutrition your child needs.  Unless she's there to see every meal you give him, she really has NO way of knowing.  Besides that, why is it her business to decide whether or not you should get up in the middle of the night?<br>  <br>  For the most part, babies ask for food when they need it.  If he's still getting hungry in the middle of the night, then he probably still needs food in the middle of the night.<br>  <br>  And yes, of course it's possible that he no longer needs that feed.  It's entirely natural that as he grows, his feeding habits will change.  If he's not hungry at 3 am, then enjoy your sleep, and feed him when he tells you he's hungry.|`|mdyuUjDxaa	That is BS. My son is 14 months now, but he gets a bottle before bed, and then when he wakes up at five am. <br>  <br>  You are breastfeeding, which means your babys tummy metabolizes the breastmilk way faster than formula. <br>  <br>  If you were hungry with a gut-ache in the middle of the night, you would get up and eat, too? wouldn't you?<br>  <br>  Whatever your baby feels like and whatever your comfy with in my opinion. One thing about motherhood is you will always have a bunch of dumb@$$es assuming that everyones baby is the same and that they all go by the same rules. Nothing is farther from the truth<br>  <br>  Tell your friends that when she assumes what is best for your unique child, she is making an A$$out of U and ME ( ASSUME, get it?)|`|yCwPxulYaa	I am going through this with my doctor right now.  She said my 6 month old doesnt "have" to eat in the night anymore.  Well, my baby wakes up hungry usually once so I feed her.  I am not going to tell my hungry baby that she cannot eat.  But she woke up at 4am and nursed for like 20 minutes or so and then was up for the day at 8am.  She didn't nurse though until 9:20am because she wasn't really hungry yet.  I just think of it this way, am I hungry as soon as I get up in the morning?....usually not.  It normally takes me a little while to wake up, then I eat.  I just figure it is the same for my daughter.  <br>  <br>  I will stop giving my baby night feeds, when she quits waking up.  Until then, I don't care what anyone says, my baby is hungry and still needs to eat at night.|`|jsoSKMEmaa	I agree - depends on the baby. My little girl didn't wake in the night for a feed from 8 weeks old. However, my friends 2 year old still wakes in the night for feed! Although she has now stopped offering him milk. She offers water and nothing else.|`|SLph9RX6aa	i dream feed my 6 month old before igo to bed at 11.30 he then usually sleeps til 7.30. if he wakes i leave him fidget for a bit and he goes back to sleep, but if he sound all bothered i feed him.<br>  listen to your own instincts|`|jWl19O37aa	omg youre friend really should mind her own business ! its great youre still breast feeding at this stage ! if you want to do it then fine if not then dont , all babies are differnet every night is different , good luck and have a word with youre "friend"|`|9wSayIDwaa	Every baby is different and you have more or less answered your own question in that if your baby doesn't need a night feed then he won't wake up for it!|`|jxg88KqFaa	He may not need it, but doesn't mean you shouldn't give it to him
kvYgopThaa	You do need to keep your stress down because it could cause high blood pressure and that can have bad effects on your baby. Could you go ahead and move where your mom is? If not just try to keep to yourself most of the time when your there you don't have too much longer to go :)  congrats and good luck|`|5yAsj29Vaa	So you're living with your mother in law with your boyfriend?  Wow.  I don't think my hubby's mom would let me stay with her if my hubby and I got divorced and I was with another guy... you're lucky!  Don't complain about your living situation.  Be glad you're not living in a house where you can't afford the mortgage and no one is able to help you out.  It's very gracious of her to let you live there. <br>  Well, whatever your bf did wrong, he did it and has to serve his time.  That's the way it works.  Hopefully he'll grow up while he's serving his time so he can set a good example for your child.  In the meantime, focus on your baby; that's what's important here anyways.  Do some shopping for the baby, get his/her room ready, if you haven't already, get the crib ready and the clothes folded in the dresser and hung in the closet, take baby preparation/Lamaze classes.  To keep busy, start a scrapbook documenting your pregnancy, get one ready to do after baby comes, write in a journal, spend some time with yourself doing what YOU want to do because once baby is here, you don't get much YOU time anymore.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Oh, ok.  I just assumed when you said mother in law that you are or had been married to someone else... sry.  But still, it's great that she lets you stay there.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Well there's no way around it, so try to plan ahead with having his mom be there for you ask your coach and support person.

Ojgqd4xNaa	16.5 inches at 4 months.  She's is the 50th percentile.  It means her head is bigger then 95 out of 100 baby's her age.

Just 10 days away :)|`|YHMooY50aa	i am 35 weeks. due april 4th with a little girl! i also know 5 other women having girls!|`|46PSDx1raa	36 weeks, 5 days. due march 21 with a girl <3|`|ioZeveazaa	39 weeks-due March 7th(next Saturday) by c-section- Girl =))|`|v3LnJycKaa	23 w 3d so far we have a 65% that it is another girl, but drano tells me it is a boy.. I want my son. we have 2 gorgeous wonderful lil ladies all ready!
pX7G7Ujcaa	go for a hourly rate, maybe between 7-9 bucks a hour sound about good be mindful that you will need to watch him or her and interact and also find fun things to do with him or her for the duration of the time baby-sitting. not to mention snacks and meal ideas|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I would charge 5 dollars per hour.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	In your home with you providing all materials and one snack (parents provide diapers, wipes and lunch) 25 per day<br>  In their home with the parents providing all food and most supplies $20 per day<br>  <br>  I pay $5 per hour or $25 a evening for my sitter to watch both our kids almost 6 yr old and 4.5 month old at my house. <br>  <br>  As an unregistered daycare I got payed $25 for under 3 yr olds and $20 a day for 3-5 or school aged full days.<br>  <br>  Registered it's $35/day for under 3's and $32.50/day for 3-5's $25 for school aged full days.<br>  <br>  If it is evening babysitting you can get away with charging more then if it is caring for the child so the parents can go to work. If mom goes to work and makes $10 an hour she can't pay you $9 right. at the most an hourly rate should be half the minimum wage in your area so for here it would be $4.25 which would work out to $38.25 for a full day (8 hours work plus travel) which is a lot for an un registered and uneducated care giver. ( by un educated I mean no early childhood education or child development programs, CPR and first aid don't count as education they are required for all care providers in a lot of places)
wiAVa1H5aa	Orally I took it for a week, then the midwife suggested vaginally  - about 2 caplets at bed time pushed near the cervix, I was in labor in 24 hours.   I delivered after 12 hours of active labor (which does not include early labor).|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You probably didn't get answers because this practice is being frowned upon more and more.  It's best to wait it out and let your baby come when he/she is ready.  Do you really want to risk delivering too early and your baby having complications?  Let nature do it's thing.<br>  I can't believe your midwife would encourage that!  7lb 4oz is not THAT big though... My son was 9lb 4oz.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	You first stop thinking too much about labour pain. Try to do some deep breathing. You will feel relax.|`|ioZeveazaa	How far are you?? You should try to go to 40 weeks regardless. Your baby is not fully finished developing till then. Trust me I know. I was taken three weeks early and I had all kinds of issues. Not a good idea to rush your baby. If anything you can get a c-section at 40 weeks. You may be able to do natural though. Your baby's health is more important and I can't believe your midwife said that to you. Good luck!!
tkQq5tR1aa	You should name it 'Clappy' or 'Skankabel'.|`|UUysEV0yaa	What about Gettalifa, which means "so isolated and lonely and nothing better to do with their time" in my culture.|`|xLPB0Z2maa	Lol! I like Gottatakeadump- it means graceful and relieving of stress.|`|kBixVQHhaa	i like Gottaripone! I means "trying to release" in my culture.|`|J3gslQMCaa	Gottapoopa|`|CMuL7XpKaa	I prefer Gottaurinate it means "Perfection"|`|RnB6D6ZYaa	I don't care if you tell the whole Internet about this, I still refuse to pay child support.
Y5NXQ0JPaa	I have had the epidural twice now. I love it!!!! Best pain killer ever. Its normal to be nervous since its your first child and you just have so much in your mind, but trust me once you feel those labor pains you won't even feel the epidural and won't even care. You are just going to want it.They put it in when you are having a contraction so you don't feel it go in.<br>  <br>  Good Luck my dear you will be jsut fine!|`|AA10468184	I think the best thing you can do is educate yourself.  Yes, the worst part of the epidural (as far as pain goes) is the local anesthetic - lidocaine usually that is injected at the area of insertion.  It does feel like a bee sting, but 98% of the time, the patient tells me it is nothing compared to the contractions.  Some say it's a little worse or about the same as when they had their IV inserted into their arm.<br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/epidural.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornb...</a>|`|ybexjS2Paa	Don't worry it  will all be fine. I had epidural with both of my kids and my spine is ok. The anaesthesiologists know what they are doing. I can't remember it being like a bad bee sting but I remember the pressure. Comparing to contractions getting epidural was a piece of cake ;) Relax and don't stress yourself over it.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Why do some women stress about labor?<br>  <br>  You will be in so much pain you probably won't feel the epidural.<br>  From what you describe...you probably will be screaming asking for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I did not have one and I've never had stitches or broken anything but I had a painful miscarriage before so I knew what to expect.  my friends say it didn't hurt when they got the epidural.<br>  <br>  Relax|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I understand your fear and it is normal to have these feelings. I am also having my first within two weeks. BUT the more fear you go in with the harder you will make it for yourself. Try to relax about it. You are not the first woman to go through this and you will not be the last.<br>  <br>  Just breathe lol..|`|1rh8B3aKaa	Is epidural obligatory where you live?<br>  If not, why don't you go for natural birth?<br>  Remember in the past  many, many women got their babies with any way of pain-killing.  <br>  I had my two girls also without any anesthetic. <br>  With epidural your body is lame in the lower part and you won't feel when it is time to push  the baby out.  That is not acceptable. And there are more risks.<br>  In spite of all the pain it is better to feel your body. <br>  What you need more in stead of painkillers  is a person who sits beside you, who holds your hand and who helps you breathe, helps you relax and who is encouraging you all the time throught the delivery.  The pain is tremendous yes, but bearable.<br>  It's your body and your body knows exactly what to do.<br>  Think it over. <br>  If you want the epidural I think it won't be dangerous, they do it so many times.  But I have no experience with epidural, thanks God!    <br>  I   totally  agree with   Asher.|`|Arb9IOs5aa	im exactly the same was petrified of having an epidural as when i have blood tests done i end up fainting lol right up until the until the labour of my fourth child where i felt so out of control i was beging for one. i felt a scratch with the local and then as they were doing the next bit i had tingling down my legs into my toes which lasted about 10 seconds, That was it i was pain free and calm absolute bliss. The next few weeks after i had a little lump where the needle went in but nothing out of the ordinary, you  will be fine hunni and like u said its better than suffering the agony of labour xx goodluck xxm|`|DVX8UVKOaa	By the time I was screaming for an epidural, I had had so much gas and air, pethidine and anything else on offer, that I was completely oblivious to the needle going in. I needed it so I could get some rest after 36 hours of labour. <br>  <br>  I played my labour by ear and started with a Tens machine and worked my way through everything on offer  up to the epidural. In the end I had to have a C-section.<br>  <br>  I don't know anyone who stuck to their birth plan. Maybe you should try some of the other less extreme forms of pain relief before going for the epidural, just keeping an open mind that you will ask for one when you feel you need it. Who knows, your baby might just pop out easily.|`|AA11108070	no don't be scared! i can relate i was too with my first child. She was right it feels like a really bad bee sting and then cold. i promise you once it starts working you will forget the "bee sting"  it was a good decsion for me. <br>  i would think that the anesthesiologist would be well trained and not harm your spine/spinal cord. you will be in good hands, but ask your doctor about the risk. just think about all the women that have the wonderful experience of  the epidural. there is so much going on the day of the delivery why worry about being in pain.<br>  good luck with the delivery.<br>  and its only natural to be scared, but you will do fine!!!|`|TnAIq152aa	Hiya ive been there!!Iwas so scared with everything that could happen with labour but when ur there doing it you will suprise urself.the epidural was nothing at the time because i needed it i didnt care what it felt like just as long as i got some comfort and i did!!!No one can tell you wot you are going to feel until your there doing it yourself.All i can say is have good support people that you like having around you and just go with it.I not long had my 2nd baby so it cant be that bad.Out of everything i found the breastfeeding a real challange.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	No offense but if you are so afraid don't get one. Women have naturally given birth for centuries. It is not better than suffering the full pain of labor. Labor is what your body was made for. An epidural messes with that and actually poses a lot of added danger for you and your baby. You are 50% more likely to need a c-section with an epidural. And your baby is hit with those drugs too. That little tiny baby is getting drugged up before it is even born and that causes a variety of problems from not being able to nurse correctly to trouble with breathing and being unresponsive. Also, it can cause the mother to be less responsive to her baby and lose out on very important bonding. Check out a couple of books on natural childbirth. It is not as scary as you think it is. I had my son with no meds at all on the side of the road in my car. And it didn't kill me or traumatize me. It was amazing. You can do it, you just need some faith in yourself. Read Ina May Gaskin's Spiritual Midwifery. It is the best book about birth. Great stories that make you realize how beautiful birth is and that there is nothing to be afraid of!|`|kzyEuRroaa	While the epidural hurt a little bit, it did take the pain away.  I was able to have an unmedicated delivery for my last child with the help of a doula, and if I had been stronger for my first ones I would have done without.  All 3 times I got an epidural was around the transition phase- I couldn't handle the pain and doubt got the better of me.<br>  <br>  The benefits of the epidural definetly were nice, but all 3 times I had major blood pressure drops, fetal distress, and was too numb to push, as I usually was pushing not long after the drugs took effect.  The worst was with my 3rd baby.  I am a strong pusher, and ended up pushing the catheter balloon out before the nurses noticed what happened.  I ended up with a urethral tear and had to have stitches.  It sucked, and the worst was if I hadn't been numb my doctor said I would have DEFINETLY felt the pain.  I had to have the cathetar in my entire stay to heal up a little bit, and then had control issues for a few months afterwards.  Not fun.  <br>  <br>  All in all, if you can do it without- try. It was an amazing experience, and if I didn't have 4 kids already, I would definetly do it that way for any more (not happening though).  I actually recovered and felt better after my natural delivery than I did after all my epidural assisted deliveries, which surprised me.|`|sAbah6dTaa	i was like you, scared to death, I hate needles. honestly the epidurral wasn't all that bad, and I even ended up having a c-section. you might be in some small pain but NOTHING compared to what you are bringing into this world. Once you hold that beautiful baby, all that pain will go away, I promise!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats!!!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Eh, personally I prefer the pain of childbirth to the interventions and their effect on my body and my baby's.|`|9P26sacKaa	Actually, you do have to worry about the anesthesiologist hurting your spine...  some women get spinal headaches after an epidural because it punctures too far, these headaches are from spinal fluid leakage and make it so you can't sit or stand up and often require going back to the hospital to get a patch done.  This is one of the many risks of an epidural.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I do not feel that an epidural is better than "suffering the full pain of labor and delivery."  I didn't "suffer" at all with my first and I'm planning another natural delivery with the baby I'm now pregnant with.  There are a lot of factors that make women feel like childbirth is pain and suffering, but it's really not supposed to be like that.  If a woman is supported and feels secure, if she is confident and relaxes between her contractions, if she listens to her body and does what her instincts tell her to do, she often doesn't ever complain or suffer or even mention the word "pain."  Our bodies are designed to do this and we have great natural resources within our bodies that make pain go away and help us cope with labor.<br>  <br>  I also have white coat syndrome a lot of the time, which is why I DIDN'T want an epidural (I also hate needles), and why I very carefully chose my midwife.  I wanted to know who was going to be with me during labor and know that they respected me and listened to me.  I also hired a doula (that was a great idea) and invited my mom and sister to join me.  My husband was there too.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd interview some doulas and see if I could get a one-on-one childbirth class with an independent teacher who can help you work through your desires and fears about birth.  If you get a little support and good education about the natural process of birth (instead of a hospital-based class), you might get a very different idea about your ability to handle labor and get a good idea about your options for pain relief and decide at what point you would want an epidural in the first place.<br>  <br>  So, here is a link to a thorough list of risks to epidurals: <a href="http://www.healing-arts.org/mehl-madrona/mmepidural.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healing-arts.org/mehl-madrona...</a><br>  <br>  This article breaks down the potential risks and benefits of an epidural, including all risks to you, the baby, and to your labor progression: <a href="http://www.storknet.com/cubbies/childbirth/epiduralprosandcons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.storknet.com/cubbies/childbir...</a><br>  <br>  The biggest risks I personally wouldn't want to take are <br>  1. it doesn't work or only partially works (if I'm going to go through with it, I'd be pretty upset if it didn't work)<br>  2. additional interventions (you have to have an IV because of blood pressure issues related to epidurals, you have to be continually monitored because you're high-risk now, you often have to be given medication to speed your labor because epidurals often slow labor, you more often need instrumental or surgical delivery)<br>  3. infant neuro-behavioral effects like irritability, problems bonding, unresponsive, needs help breathing at first, problems breastfeeding, etc.<br>  4. possibility of fever from epidural, resulting in antibiotics for the mother and a septic workup, spinal tap, and additional observation time in the NICU for baby, all because a fever can indicate infection but is most likely from the epidural to begin with. They can't tell the reason for the fever, so they have to assume infection until proven otherwise and all sorts of interventions must be performed in the meantime.<br>  <br>  There are other risks, as you can see from the links, but these are the ones that impact me the most as a birthing mother.  That doesn't even go into the risks associated with the interventions that might become necessary after an epidural.  <br>  <br>  I really think our bodies were made to do this and do it well, without much, if any, suffering.  I think a woman who is educated and supported and confident can birth her baby with power and skill and without much pain.  It's birth, it's hard work.  It's not supposed to be suffering, even when you have no medical pain relief.  <br>  <br>  If a woman would truly have a better birth because of an epidural, then she should get one, but I really feel like women should give themselves a chance and trust in themselves, leaving the epidural as an option but not as the first choice.  I don't give you the information and risks to scare you, but to help you understand that there ARE risks and that you have to make an informed decision, knowing all of the risks and benefits of your options.<br>  <br>  For most women who have epidurals, they work just fine, with no obviously bad complications, but it is good to know if you do need more interventions or more help after baby is born, why that might be.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I was like you and terrified of the epidural.  I did not like the idea of anybody inserting anything into my spine.  However, after many many hours of excruciating back labour (my baby was posterior), I was begging for the epi, and at that point, I wouldn't have cared if they stuck it in my eyeball.  <br>  <br>  You don't know it's "the way to go" - don't make decisions set in stone until you are in the situation.  Go in with an open mind.  You may have a fast, easy labour and may not need one.  You never know.  <br>  <br>  With any anesthetic there's always a slight risk.  Yes, there is an extremely rare risk of being paralyzed from the epi, but like I said, extremely rare.  <br>  <br>  There are other complications of the epi though that you need to be aware of.  The epi slowed my labour down even more, made my baby's heartrate drop dangerously low several times (narrowly avoided an emergency c-section), made me not able to pee for 10 hours after the epi (I then contracted a UTI because they had to put a catheter in), and I couldn't move my legs or feel my contractions.<br>  <br>  Trust me - when you are in the situation, the epi will be the least of your worries.
G2auAv1Saa	I didn't feel it when they actually did it, but it does hurt later. <br>  I think it is better to be cut than tear. <br>  After my daughter was born they put an ice pack under me and it felt pretty good, it was hard to control your urine for a few days- but I think this is with any vaginal delivery. <br>  The morning after she was born that area didn't hurt so bad as my muscles did but I didn't take any meds. You can't wipe after having it, they give you a squirt bottle to rinse yourself off- and it feels so good to use. A week afterward when the stitches start dissolving it gets a little itchy, but that squirt bottle is a lifesaver! <br>  <br>  -You're going to be nervous no matter what, (corny as it sounds and I know everyone says it, but believe me its true) all the nastiness, pain and uncomfortableness of it is pushed aside when you finally get to hold your baby!<br>  <br>  They are less common than they once were, but they are still necessary in some cases. <br>  Here is what the MAYO clinic says about episiotomies. <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/episiotomy/HO00064" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/episiot...</a>|`|ioZeveazaa	A natural tear is NOT better than being "clean" cut by a scalpal. This is a more controlled cut. If you just tear then you will scar worse and then it is not controlled and can be bad. My aunt tore upwards and said it was extremely painful and wished her doctor had given her an episiotomy. It will definitely sting afterwards but your doctor will give you pain medication It is alot better though and can heal easier and faster if you get an epi than do a natural tear. Anyways you are going to have more important things to worry about like your labor pains and contractions. Your doctor will do whats best but trust me do the epi. Good luck!!|`|veO1RXrCaa	The tears were worse then the cut.  I was cut and needed nothing fancier than a squirt bottle to spray my stitches when I peed.  And a bunch of wet paper towels wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen applied to the sore area.  Also I just sat in some bum deep hot water when I got home.  I used as hot a water as I could stand.  You don't need tons of pain meds.  Its not that bad.  I was split from stem to stern and I really needed nothing more than a tylenol.  Just suck it up hon.  There are worse things then this.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I didn't have to have one for either of my deliveries.<br>  My oldest daughter (first delivery) was face up, I had trouble pushing because she got stuck, and all that jazz, and never tore, never had be cut.<br>  I wouldn't worry about it too much. If it happens, it happens, and if it doesn't, that's great.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	I didn't tear or get cut with my first... you should have seen the size of his head!!  This is kind of gross, but I read in a book you can stretch the rim of your vagina before you deliver and it will help.  It's called a perineal massage.  Google it!  Good luck!!|`|AA10747002	I am at 31 weeks with my first. I think it is better to tear naturally than being cut, that is what I wish to do and will talk to my ob about it.|`|AA10468184	It is rare nowadays to need an episiotomy.  The docs I work with rarely do it.  I would be very firm with her that you do not want an episiotomy that if you are going to tear, you would rather.  Typically the tear will heal quicker and will not be as painful afterward.  (I've had one with an episiotomy and one without - and without was much less painful after)|`|wv4hPOuQaa	I had one with my first, it does not hurt. Actually it is better to be cut than tear because a cut is cleaner (straight) than a tear (zigzag)...being cut heals better, faster too. It hurts afterwards regardless...that is, showering, going to the bathroom, etc. I was given a spray for the pain that worked wonders. it wasn't that bad and mine was not a small cut either.|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	I didn't have an episiotomy with my first birth.... And afterwards I wished I would have. I tore.... I needed a lot of stitches, and where I tore, it was hard to stitch, apparently.<br>  <br>  My second, I had an episiotomy, and it went so much better! If your dr thinks that you will tear, just get cut. It's a cleaner cut (meaning it's a straight line), and odds are it will be smaller than a tear.|`|kvYgopThaa	wow i didn't realise how bad the epsiotomy could be. Im nervous now lol i hadn't done much research into it and now that i read what you have wrote its making me wonder.|`|113FoyMFaa	i didn't tear or need to be cut during my first.  your MD needs to be set straight.  tell her NOT to cut you.  a natural tear is better anyway.|`|532XA7lkaa	I had an epidural and glad I did...I ended up having a 3rd degree episiotomy by surprise because the baby just couldn't make it out and the tear would have been to hard to repair.  I didn't feel it at all when they did it and after 2 hours of pushing, I pushed twice and the baby was out, so I needed it.  I didn't feel it though because I had an epidural and I couldn't feel anything down there.  After the after birth was delivered, the stitching began and that's where it hurt.  They took my epidural off almost immediately after giving birth, then gave me several injections, which I half felt, down there before the extensive stitching began.  About 45 minutes to repair.  I was so sore after, it was awful.  Recovery was totally different than I expected because of this.  The stitches dissolved eventually, but ouch.  I sat on pillow the first 3 weeks of my son's life....I was mad it happened...but realize it was necessary.  I am now a little over 15 weeks pregnant second time around and I have already spoken with the doctor about it. She says unfortunately, usually if I had one the first time, since there is scar tissue, a cut would be easier the second time if needed.  But she was understanding.  It was just scary and last minute during labor...I wasn't expecting it and it wasn't a choice...|`|AA11783671	I have had two kids.  The first I tore a little, with the second I had an episitomy.  I did not feel the tear with the first because I had an epidural, but the after effects I itched and itched like crazy.  I felt very sore all over.  With the second, I was all natural with no meds and had the episiotomy.  I honestly didn't even know that the doctor was cutting.  He obviously stitched me up when it was all over (the shot of numbing stuff burned!) but after that, it was no problem.  I didn't have any trouble with swelling, itching, pooping... nothing.  At the hospital they gave me maxi pads that had like a cooling cell in them and they were AWESOME!  I took a few home with me and used them for the first two or three days after birth.  Also forgot to mention that you do a get a squirt bottle to rinse with after you go pee, etc. and putting warm water in that is great too.  I had that with both kids.<br>  As far as it being needed during a first delivery, I don't buy it.  It's usually not needed for most women and if it is, it's typically on a big baby.  (My first was 7/11, my second was 9/9).  I would discuss your concerns with your MD and let her know that you want to wait it out as long as possible.  Mine did it as a last resort after he had drained my bladder with a cathader and I'd pushed about 30 mins with no further movement down.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Episiotomy is an outdated procedure.  I see it this way: you don't know for sure you'll tear.  Episiotomies have a high chance of tearing further than the cut.  Why cause an injury when you don't absolutely need one?<br>  <br>  Your OB is incredibly misinformed.  If she performs an episiotomy on you without your consent she can be charged with assault and battery. What is her rationale for it being NEEDED with a first birth?  Really?  Does she have that little faith in your body to do it's job?<br>  <br>  The perineum is a stretchy band of muscle that is designed to unfold over the baby's head if you allow it to.  It won't work right though if you work against it- like pushing on your back, and having coached pushing (where you hold your breath for ten counts and have someone tell you when to push). <br>  <br>  I tore with both my births and you don't even feel it.  Honestly.  There was just some stinging as the baby's head came out, and that's it.  And I had no drugs.
2vhXqnJzaa	As terrible as it is I'd have done the same, there are a lot of weird people out there, yes the odds are he was a lonely old man who wanted to chat but is it worth the risk? No, your child is far too precious so don't feel bad just feel saddened that the world is such a dangerous place these days.|`|DVX8UVKOaa	You did the right thing. It's not worth the risk. Even if he gave them completely innocently, he may have sneezed on them or they might have been in his pocket with a used hankie,<br>  <br>  I once heard of someone who used to be given a bag of almonds every week by the elderly man who she did cleaning for. After a while she asked him why almonds every week. He told her that he didn't like nuts but that he enjoyed the coating on sugared almonds. He would suck the coating off but didn't want to throw the nuts away?|`|9tARaFTOaa	no i can understand how you feel, unfortunately you hear so much about bad people hurting kids on the news nowadays, it makes you question everone.<br>  he was more than likely just a sweet old man being nice and was happy when you took them off him. if you feel bad, why dont you get her another pack of similar sweets tomorrow, that might make you feel better.|`|idFvwX9zaa	I think it is quite a strange thing to be so paranoid about strangers. To accept with a smile then bin them because a two year old shouldn't really be eating sweets I can understand, but to bin them because you are frightened something bad had been done to them...?? Over-reaction for sure!|`|UUysEV0yaa	Id (and think) do the same thing. You did the right thing by throwing them away. Better safe than sorry right? Who just happens to have a bag of lollies with them?<br>  As long as you were nice to him, thanked him etc there isnt much more you can do than that. That would have made him feel nice.|`|AA10120592	i hate to say it, but i would have done the exact same thing. be polite, take them and tell him she could have them later, then get home and trash them. he doesn't know you did that, so its not hurting his feelings. i would way rather be safe than sorry. people are nuts now a days and do some weird stuff, who knows if those candies were safe or not. i say good job, and you were right to do what you did.|`|JBoRCQpOaa	Well you know what they say<br>  <br>  "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY"<br>  I would have there's know point in taking the risk he might have poisened them etc|`|42tTsVuxaa	Oh come on I bet if it was a sweet old lady you would have no problems, and just because its a man you all over react. Paranoia, an understatement I live in Denmark and very often elderly people will give my boys a sweet (sorry candy) I am there or my wife is there whats the problem, they know that if we are not around then that's another matter. If I am out with the boys and they are eating some sweets, most times if there is another child I will get one of them to offer the other child a sweet.<br>  <br>  Oh yes What do you do about haloween, throw all the sweets your children get away just in case there is a bad one. Why not ban it, then you all would be safe. <br>  <br>  All my boys friends share their sweets, do you say no to that have they washed their hands, <br>  <br>  Never buy sweets from a pick and mix the assistant may have sneezed over them, never buy sweets because you never know if they have been contaminated, very soon the whole situation becomes very silly<br>  <br>  <br>  RR|`|WBHJ4Py9aa	u did exactly the right thing.  thats really good im gonna try that now! yes 99% of the time they are probably a clean lovely old person etc but u dont know ehere the sweets have come from no obv they prob would not have poison in them but u dont know ehere they were before they were in the bag germs hair urggh lol|`|VHHis05Naa	Absolutely.  I'd have thrown them away also. You don't know him and even so, candy isn't good for a 2 year-old.|`|4gZYucHMaa	If he took the sweets out of the same bag himself I don't see the harm in what he did especially if you saw it.<br>  <br>  I go by gut. I am suspicious by nature *you have to be nowadays* but there are some good people out there.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I tell them no, they can't have it as they have allergies.   Which is true, and also an easy way out.<br>  <br>  But, it is infuriating that this happens so often!  WTF?   Handing out candy to kids that aren't yours nor do you know?   I also hate folks reaching over to touch your baby and they do not know the infant or you....   UGH!   More then that, it's a hard candy which under 4s are not to have, and candy is a super duper huge thing around our home only given in supreme moments of awesomeness by the children.<br>  <br>  Sorry, just say she is allergic to milk or peanuts or chocolate.|`|AA11327039	You're just a little worried.  They were likely just fine.  I worry too and at first, when elderly people gave my kids something, I'd get scared and pitch it too...but now I just take a little bite out of the candy and if it tastes fine, I let her have it.....(I also check it to make sure it's properly sealed and looks normal)|`|AA12305061	I think you trusted my instincts. <br>  I went out halloweening, and even if the people smile at me weird i throw them out. I don't trust.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry. If you think she needs them, go buy some for her.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Thats paranoia what did you think he would do ? Poison the sweets ?
H74F8jxuaa	Whenever I went to my doctor for my first prenatal check-up with my pregnancy, she told me that I can do all my normal activities.  There is no reason to not do fun things like skating.  Just try to not fall and you will be just fine.  Enjoy yourself while you can because later on in your pregnancy, your belly might get in the way of activities such as skating.  Don't stress yourself too much.  Do whatever you feel like doing and don't overdo things.  If something is uncomfortable to do, don't do it.  Congrats!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	No rollerskating. Do not do anything that may cause you to fall or harm yourself and your unborn child. First trimester is a very delicate time, this is when the balance of miscarriage and continuation of pregnancy hangs by a thread. Although, our body has adopted in plenty of ways (thank you mother nature), it is not safe to put yourself at risk. You don't need to be scared or paranoid but, do be careful. Anything that is high impact or could possibly jeopardize your pregnancy should be avoided.|`|NoTmOFV1aa	You are fine righ tnow to go out and beactive, it is important to stay healthy during your pregnancy. The whole lifting thing, that applies when yuo are further along, and things that are obviously too heavy for you, like more than ten pounds, you dont want to pick up by yourself, and dont lift over your head. Go on and skate tho! Have fun!|`|SeDiJ32Haa	Skating would probably be a no-no. It just comes down to common sense. The further along you get, the less you should be doing in terms of lifting and such. However, there are many many women out there who remain very active throughout their pregnancies. When in doubt, ask your doctor!
kv8ZFPP1aa	i think it is morally wrong. unless it is for medical reasons. but i do not think that they should use it as a form of birth control.|`|8dhe15MUaa	no i not and never will|`|t1zlbOURaa	I'm never for killing people unless absolutely necessary.<br>  <br>  I'm always against killing innocent people.<br>  <br>  So, I'm against abortion.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I'm 20 weeks pregnant after two years trying and four miscarriages but I'm glad they're legal...although I do think they shouldn't be available as late as they are.<br>  <br>  I personally wouldn't have one unless my life was in danger but they should be available on the NHS for anybody because, as far as I'm concerned at least, a woman who is considering one as "the easy way out" is clearly not going to be a fit mother...it's all well and good saying "put the baby up for adoption then" but anybody who has had any experience with the adoption and fostering services in England will tell you how hard it is to put a baby up for adoption because social services seem to think the baby staying with it';s birth parents is always the best possible option...even when the child is being abused...they will keep warning the parents and taking the children into temporary care before returning the kids to their birth parents again...<br>  <br>  A child born to a woman who doesn't want it will more than likely be neglected and abused, as a result it will end up with various emotional and mental health problems such as attachment disorder and probably grow up to have an unwanted child of its own...and so a downward spiral is created...|`|zi6Ipmfuaa	i will NEVER believe in that. if you don't want to have a baby i would just tell that person to keep their legs closed until they want a baby. you said if the mother was in danger well it depends on how far along the baby was. if it's still a fetus then you would have to if the mom is dead.|`|bQk0vpfSaa	i am pro choice. i feel that it is up to the woman to decide. it is her body, no one elses.|`|ajPHMliqaa	its a necessary evil|`|AA12129792	Personally I think enough unwanted children get born to families who don't want them/drug addicts/mothers who are only children themselves.<br>  <br>  I think these children then suffer.

Its wrong for someone to get pregnant, and just go get their baby sucked out in a machine...and the baby's body breaks...its horrible.|`|TAGQ4FQQaa	wow ur brave with this!!! i personally dont agree but every1 has there reasons, i would never have an abortion.|`|vDC8TXJraa	i think everyone who is all "omg abortion is muder, it is so wrong".... need to take back seat with this one and dont even bother trying to talk about it if you have never been in that situation. I think, if your in a situation where you know the baby will not be raised into a financially and emotionally stable environment then its up to the mother whether or not she decides to termanate her pregnancy or not. Everyone thinks having an abortion is the easy way out of things, but its alot harder making that decision than anything. Unless you have been in that situation yourself, where you have got pregnant, i dont think you have a valid opinion. Having an abortion is emotionally, phisically and physcologically damaging. Its not an easy thing to do, so unless you know what your really talking about i wouldnt say anything.|`|cQb2vqDcaa	Personally, I wouldn't have an abortion unless the baby or myself were in danger, or, God forbid, I were raped.  <br>  <br>  But i would never preach or judge anyone who does have an abortion.  We all know birth control isn't 100% effective, and if someone decides it's not the right time for them, then they shouldn't feel obliged to carry on with the pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  What annoys me is people who sleep around without using any form of control, and use abortion as a form of birth control.|`|9Eebavmiaa	as in, "would die"...i'm going to assume maybe medical problem? if that's the case...i think maybe medical care should be brought in. if the drs feel it's okay to continue with pregnancy and birth then go for it.<br>  <br>  i personally DO NOT agree with it, as the Bible says it's murder. I wouldn't want to go to hell for having sex on my own time and not taking the responsibility for it. If you don't want it, have it and give it to someone who derserves to be a parent.|`|0ZN5H1nsaa	I agree with you, Im strongly against abortion .. i dont think its fair to not lt a child live just because your not ready to have it, you were irresponsible enough to get pregnant in the first place, you should face the conseqences insead of killing your unborn child. But if for example it wasnt your fault like you got raped then there would be an acception because it wasnt your fault, and it would grow up with only one parent and knowing your a chil of a rape ? .. i dont think i would like that very much.. and also if yo fund out they had a life thretening disease that could ruin there life .. then i think it might be best for the child nott to be born and suffer there hole life. Or if it puts the mother at risk of death. But everyone had theyre oewn opionions .. and i dont hink anything that people say can change what you feel on the inside :) .. x|`|1sRiR9jJaa	Personally, I think it is upto the individual if they want an abortion or not. For some people, they get pregnant by mistake. I certainly wouldnt want any child to be brought up in a world where its mother doesnt love it and didnt want it, and with a father it wud never see because it was a stupid one night stand. I dont think a mother shud have to live with a child that reminds her of when she was raped either. So yeah, we sould have a choice in life, in my opinion.|`|piemZ36eaa	i think by choosing to have sex you are taking on a responsibility, and <br>  <br>  once you have done this i do not believe you have the right to choose wether something lives or dies - just because its in your body does not mean you have to right to kill it.<br>  <br>  however, there will ALWAYS be many exeptions - e.g rape, medical reasons.<br>  <br>  im deffinately pro-choice and think that it should be everyones individual choice- however it just should not be used as contraception.|`|LDiBjNf5aa	I guarantee you could get thousands of responses to this question if you used the search button, without starting up another emotional debate that everyone has already responded to.
UXoTCL98aa	yes they are called bella bands and you can either find them at your local target for 16.99 or at target.com.  I just purchased one. My friends all love them and you can go to targets website and read reviews on them as well, they definitely seem worth the money. <br>  <br>  When I went into motherhood maternity the other day they cost almost 40 dollars and they were exactly the same as at target.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|CeylRxK4aa	I think it is called a Bella Band and unfortunately, I'm not sure where you can buy them - google and find out!....congrats!
AA10458750	I hear you, I was wondering the same thing. Friends told me that the reason their stomachs are flabby still isn't because they couldn't loose it, it's bc they got caught up taking care of the baby and were just too tired. I suggest you do like I am going to and make prior arrangements for a definite 2 days where you can go the gym after the baby is born.|`|7KkTel7Oaa	hehe trust me, you can have a flat tummy and stretch marks. It's all a matter of how you exercise during pregnancy and how you exercise after you have the baby. Oh, and how much you gain during pregnancy. it's cool.|`|oCqs76KAaa	After the baby is born, get on a bike. Ride it a lot. This is the most practical and "easy" way to get your thighs and hips back into shape. I also suggest getting an "abs" video.  This will help the stomach to not be "saggy".|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Your stomach will go back down, try to wear a post-partum girdle afterwards. This will help your uterus shrink back down quicker. Also breastfeeding will help your body bounce back after the baby is born.|`|drOXfPM6aa	I had stretch marks but, once the weight went down they went away. It may depend on your age since I am young.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	After having my daughter stretch marks and all my stomach went back to normal so theres hope for u yet.
3xMQW0A6aa	20 minutes is about the time it would take for them to make you sick. i noticed i only got sick from them if i took them without having a full stomach. if i make sure i eat something (not just a couple crackers) then they dont bother me. also taking them at night helps, but you also must take them with food or else you might still get sick.<br>  good luck!  <br>  ive also heard that if you take 2 flinstones vitamins that it is sufficient enough. talk to your doctor about it if it is bad enough.|`|W1wDHUYoaa	I noticed my "morning" sickness dissipated when I quit taking the prenatals they gave me. I have intestinal issues as it is and the iron in prenatals just was killing me. So I went out and bought the flintstones vitamins! they taste great and I never get nauseous/upset stomache any more. Not to mention they have just the right amount of nutrients you need. Compare the labals to prenatals their almost identical.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I think my prenatals do make me sick, but as long as I eat a meal right after I take them it seems to help. Talk to your doctor about it though. You may want to switch to a different brand. good luck.|`|m3oA5xLYaa	i take them with supper everynight. I seem to do better when i take them with food, or before bed.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	try taking them at night rite b4 bed. that might help|`|Nux5S6oVaa	Same thing happened to me.  I stopped taking them in the am so I didn't feel sick all day.<br>  <br>  I take them at night after supper along with a Vitamin B6 and I've noticed a huge change!!  No more sickness...I probably sleep right threw it, but the B6 helps!<br>  <br>  It's just the combination of hormones and the vitamins that throws you tummy for a loop!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|DDYwnut6aa	Mine made me sick.  Start taking them before bed.
dXMdt3gVaa	I would just get her some decals or stickers (you get them at walmart in the paint/diy section by the wall paper) to make it look more girly on her side of the room, like above her bed. You get princesses, Dora the explorer, Tinkerbell, flowers etc.  My daughters loved glow in the dark stars/flowers etc, and we hung fairy barbies from the ceiling with fishing gut so they look like theyre floating around her bed. Total cost for making it look cute, like $20.|`|bspRfskYaa	What about buying some specialist wall stickers?  These are quite cheap to buy, can instantly transform a room and are easily removed when you want to change it.<br>  I bought 2 packs that were all different shapes and colored cicrles, and stuck them on the walls and wardrobe - my little girl loves her spotty room and this would work for a boy as well as a girl.  You could get some spotty bedding and curtains or just pick a color of one of the  circles and have that colored bedding.|`|ZZ6fJqCbaa	I agree with the others about the wall decals.  I just bought some for our nursery from allposters.com.  They have a ton of different designs and they range from $19-32.  You should check them out.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Buy an inexpensive projector.  Something like this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Artograph-Tracer-Jr-Opaque-Projector/dp/B000A35Q1K/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1235678757&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Artograph-Tracer-J...</a><br>  <br>  Project illustrations from your child's favorite books onto the wall.  Trace them with a pencil. <br>  <br>  Then, paint over the outlines with black oil paint. ($10 a tube at any hobby/craft store)<br>  <br>  Color the drawings in with inexpensive watercolors.<br>  <br>  Spray over the finished, dryed murals with matte acrylic ($10-15 at hobby/craft store)<br>  <br>  We also wrote words on the wall, names of the characters, little sayings, favorite poems.  And, as the kids get older & have new favorites, we add those in, too!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I would go hunt around on craigslist.org for free and cheap used things. You can get a big rug to cover part of the carpet. Work with the carpet's colors, different tones of pinks and very light purples would look good with maroon.<br>  <br>  Paint is always the cheapest way to transform a room. You can paint all the walls one light color or paint just one wall in a stronger color, it will become your accent wall. <br>  <br>  You can also paint furniture - paint the dresser, bed frame, etc.<br>  <br>  Look through Target and Walmart and other cheaper department stores for little lamps and wall hangings. For our son's room, we got a cheap little white lamp for around $7 and then painted the base blue and green to match his room. <br>  <br>  Buy some shelving, you can get several of those little shelves you attach to the wall and then put the stuffed animals and some pictures of your family on them.<br>  <br>  If you have stores like Marshalls or TJ Maxx's, go there to look for cheaper decorations. You might find some great decorative pillows for $10, wall hangings for $12, etc.<br>  <br>  Look on the internet for inspiration too. It always helps to have an idea of exactly how you'd like the room to look, and then base your shopping on that. You don't have to duplicate everything in detail, but it's good to have an idea of what you'd like. Here are some pictures you can look at of little girls rooms:   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&rls=com.microsoft%3A*&q=girls+bedroom" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There are 4 of us in the bed now.  Its me, hubby, 3 year old, and 15 month old.<br>  <br>  I am hoping that around when the younger one is 2-3 we can get them both into their own room, though probably they will choose to sleep together.<br>  <br>  Babies learn to get off beds safely pretty early and its not like I don't notice them moving.  However I do make sure that there is no way they can fall off the bed without at least a few seconds for me to stop them.  So you want to block off the sides, or at least one side of the bed.|`|46K4FtE0aa	I never co slept with any of my 3, i think it is harder to break the habit later and is also dangerous, as it is easy for the child to either slide under the covers and suffocate, or you could roll over on it. You are better breaking the habit NOW. He will eventually start to sleep through. Think about it, when you are in a strange bed, say on holiday, do you not find it hard to sleep through or even get to sleep. he is used to the warmth and comfort of you now and if you don't stop it now, you are in for lots of problems later. He will get used to sleeping on his own withing a couple of weeks if you stick to it and don't keep going to him if he cries, just make sure he isn't in any pain, he is fed and dry and not thirsty, if you have to go in to him don't pick him up or speak, believe me it will work.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My son is 17 months old and we still co-sleep. When he started really moving around I moved him so he sleeps in the middle of me and my husband instead of on the side of the bed. This way one of us will wake up if he starts trying to get out of the bed.|`|EeGgovyCaa	At 7 months is when I started co-sleeping with my DD only. She suddenly stopped liking her crib. she would sleep between me and the wall with pillows all around her.|`|GsSRY7quaa	stopped co-sleeping about the 2nd week. leave him in his bed, he will adjust.|`|zQWNb6neaa	When they start moving around I simply attach a bed railing on my side of the bed.

They will probably require a copy of your doctor's note.  From there, they should treat it as they would anyone else who has to be on medical leave or temporary disability...  they should be able to tell you what your company's policies are on that.

But, why don't you go on maternity leave already? You already have to be on bed rest.|`|yGabEjDMaa	Well - if they word it right, yes they can.  I know this, cause it happened to me at 4 months pregnant.  They can not actually fire you because you are pregnant, but their wording in their retirement letter to you can be worded in a way they can.  I hate to say that.  Yes, I did have a lawsuit again my old employer, but it didn't help.  I filled out an FMLA form to take time off until the baby was born.  I put on the "date to return line", unsure, will return within 6 weeks of baby's birth.  Well, somehow or another, they found a loop hole in that statement, and  I was gone.  Fought them for over 3 years - and still nothing.  They can not actually say, you are fired because you are pregnant.  But, my boss was able to say, I was being fired due to my medical condition - which was bedrest.  Do NOT stress.  You and the baby do NOT need that.  You may want to consult an attorney before talking to your employer, just to get ducks in a row if you are leary on what they may or may not due.  I wish you all the luck!  This happened to me over 8 years ago, and I'm still bitter!|`|fccdcaa6e1aa306a88110de27284c970aa	no just tell them about your problem and they should understand but if they do fire you then take them to court and sue them b/c they cant do that|`|M3i6o4WPaa	yeah and they probly will......shoulda kept your legs closed

Yet, you don't want to report him. So.. the question remains, what do you mean what else do you need to do? You said you've taken the Plan B and you've made an appointment with Planned Parenthood, (what are you going to do there?) I think you've pretty much covered everything that you can do aside from making him pay for what he did.|`|GqDmkAl3aa	Ok first off, the plan b was a good choice, as for your choice not to report it thats just stupid!!! because of people like you that dont report it their are rapist on our streets that get ahold of innocent woman and even children.

qHa4w8eyaa	If you suspect you may be pregnant, don't ignore it - the sooner you know, the more you can do to take care of yourself and your baby.  For starters, how about taking some prenatal vitamins - this will at least ensure that you have an adequate supply of folic acid.  While you are out buying the vitamins, I would pick up a reliable home pregnancy test (i.e. First Response) as soon as possible.  Take the test first thing in the morning, and try not to drink too many fluids before you go to sleep so that you get a concentrated sample for your test.  They always say that it happens when you stop thinking about it too much....so it sounds like this may just be your time....I hope so. :)  Best of luck....keep us posted!|`|VqCZ7rNkaa	Hi mam , I have read your problems and I understood that It is a commen problems for a female during the peroid but in your Q's you also so many other symptoms.

nyuB4POqaa	I bled for 2 weeks, and haven't had anything in 4 months, but I think it's because I'm breast feeding<br>  Also I think breasfeeding speeds thigns up|`|8t8NjjnVaa	I think I bled for about 2 weeks.  <br>  <br>  I was exclusively breastfeeding (no formula at all), and even at 9 months, she was only getting solids about every other day, and it was only a few bites.  She really didn't begin to take in much solids until she was well over a year.  She was also still nursing in the night at least twice until well past a year.  I got my period back when she was 15 months old.<br>  <br>  With my second, she had jaundice and was so sleepy that she didn't want to nurse much.  I tried to get her to nurse more, but she was just so sleepy.  So with her, I got a very light period when she was about 5 weeks old.  Shortly after that, her jaundice finally improved quite a bit and she was more alert and began nursing like a 'normal' newborn, and my period didn't come back again until she was 15 months old.  And just like with my first, she didn't eat much solids until well past a year, and was still nursing in the night.|`|G6eBvDz8aa	She is 4 weeks today..<br>  <br>  Slowed down bleeding at 2 weeks.. 3 weeks bleeding completely done..<br>  <br>  No period yet but having mild period cramps so im assuming its coming! <br>  Oh and I breast fed the first week and a half..|`|bnbXMlIpaa	i didn't stop bleeding until my son was about 3 weeks old.. then the next month i got my regular period..my discharge was never green only that brown bloody color.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I bled for 5wks although after the first week it was just brown spotting for the most part.

It might have been less.<br>  <br>  Its not really normal to have 2-3 weeks of lochia rubra (bright red bleeding).  I am not sure why American medical professionals think it is, nor can I figure out why in most of the world its considered normal for the umbilical cord to drop off within 1 week or two at the latest and in the US moms are often told up to 8 weeks is normal.<br>  <br>  I get my periods back very early considering I follow the criteria for ecological breastfeeding.  5 months for my first and 4 months for my second.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactational_amenorrhea_method" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactational...</a><br>  Return of menstruation following childbirth varies widely among individuals. The closer a woman's behavior is to the Seven Standards of ecological breastfeeding, the later (on average) her cycles will return. Average return of menses for women following all seven criteria is 14 months after childbirth, with some reports being as soon as 2 months while others are as late as 42 months.[citation needed] Couples who desire spacing of 18 to 30 months between children can often achieve this through breastfeeding alone.<br>  <br>  Although the first post-partum cycle is sometimes anovulatory (reducing the likelihood of becoming pregnant again before having a post-partum period), subsequent cycles are almost always ovulatory and therefore must be considered fertile. However, some women find that breastfeeding interferes with fertility even after ovulation has resumed. Luteal phases being too short to sustain pregnancy is a common example.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gynob.com/lochia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gynob.com/lochia.htm</a><br>  nvolution happens quickly.  There is bleeding, however, and it's bright red for a couple of days ("lochia rubra"); by two weeks the weeping effect doesn't have enough blood mixed with it to keep it red, and a pale discharge is noted ("lochia alba"). Generally, bleeding should get less and less over time, but there can be some bursts of activity for up to a month. But for the most part, most of the real bleeding should be over within a few days.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicdirect.co.uk/diseases/default.ihtml?pid=1481&step=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicdirect.co.uk/diseases/de...</a><br>  After a few days the lochia, or vaginal discharge, changes to a brownish colour containing altered blood and serum. It is now called lochia serosa. Towards the end of the second week following delivery, the vaginal discharge becomes yellowish-white and is now known as lochia alba. A few women may experience lochia rubra for two or three weeks before the vaginal loss begins to tail off and dissapear. Normal lochia is not offensive. Your midwife will check your vaginal loss daily for a few days to make sure that it is within normal limits.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ip/jennyhassall/sessionPuerperium.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ip/jennyhassall/ses...</a><br>  Lochia<br>  The decidual lining is shed in the lochia, which persists for up to 4 weeks<br>  Lochia rubra 2-4 days and contains blood pieces of decidua amnion chorion vernix lanugo meconium and is dark red/brown<br>  Lochia serosa to day 10, contains some blood, wound exudate, erythrocytes, leucocytes, cervical mucous and shreds of degenerating decidua<br>  Lochia alba last for 3-6 weeks, mainly contains leucocytes, mucous bacteria and epithelial cells<br>  Most women produce a total of 150-400ml of lochia (Blackburn and Loper 1992)
SkFgDxpEaa	yeah a few years ago there was a big story of a 605/68 woman who gave birth to a healthy baby.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I'm kinda stuck on the insinuation that women in their 40s or 50s may not have a husband that they are romantically & emotionally attached to.  Some women in their late 30s or early 40s are perhaps remarrying & would love to have another child.  I'm 42, talking about marriage with my bf, who is 43, and having a child together is definitely something we are discussing.  <br>  <br>  Besides - 40s & 50s are elders?  Bah - try 80s & 90s!|`|9BbV2xqIaa	I think that if a woman genuinely *wants* to have a child, she will likely be affectionate to it regardless of her age. however, medically speaking, it is much harder to give birth to a healthy baby at an older age. there is an increased risk of disorders and birth defects in the offspring. furthermore, the mother herself will be at increased risk during the pregnancy as well as during birth.<br>  <br>  secondly, caring for a newborn is obviously not an easy job. raising a child requires a great effort and investment of time and energy alike. if the couple is old enough that either the mother or the father has retired (if not both), they will be able to spend more time raising the child. however, just because one is retired does not automatically increase his/her energy level. the parent(s) may still be too old to have sufficient energy to care for a toddler. (assuming that energy level does indeed decrease with age.)<br>  <br>  having babysat, caring for a kid around 3 is a pain in the ***. and I am 18, with a half-decent energy level most of the time (although I was 16 when I babysat, not that it really changes anything). and I did this for only 1 day. I could not imagine caring for a toddler or an infant at the age of 70, for years on end until it was old enough to care for itself.<br>  <br>  however, if a given person feels that s/he can handle it, then there is no real issue about having children. if it is what the couple wants to do and if they feel that they can care effectively for the offspring, then there should be no problems.
oWAUb6vpaa	I highly suggest to keep using what you're using (especially the vitamin E). Yours don't sound bad at all, though, so I'm sure they won't be very noticable soon after your belly begins to tighten up again, (which will happen a lot faster if you plan to nurse your baby.)<br>  I'm sure it'll look fine in no time. <br>  <br>  & Congratulations, mom!|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	i got horrible, horrible stretch marks when i was pregnant. i used everything too! but nothing seemed to work. now 8 months later, i still have them and they are FINALLY fading :). but i don't use anything on them, BUT my friend uses a product she got from avon, i don't know the name of it, but her stretch marks (and even other scars not related to her pregnancy) are gone as well. so my advice would be to get a hold of your local avon lady and ask her about it.|`|B1FqOGX1aa	Girl!!!

They will fade over time but they will not go away. Mine are completely skin colored but if you run your finger over them, you can still feel the depth of them. It is like any other scar that you have. They are genetic and also depend on how quickly you gained weight and how much natural elasticity you have in your skin.  Mine started fading pretty nicely about 6 months after I had my son.|`|nluNSDI4aa	coco butter is really good. But i would suggest that you go to one of those Chinese herbal stores or black beauty supply stores, and get this African Coco Butter. That is not the name of it but that is what it is. It's the real thing. Because walmart and other stores sell you coco butter but they put stuff in it  that's why it doesn't work as good or as fast as you would like. But this one, is the real thing. Nothing added in it. You can get in like a jar or bottle. They would have red, green, and yellow stripes going around the bottle. And takes old, new, and stretch marks off your skin. And even your tone. I used it and you could notice results in a week if you use it how you are suppose to. That's the best I can tell you. Pray all is well tho:)|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You can't get rid of them completely, unless you have costly laser treatments. All the creams, lotions, and oils in the world will only help minimize the appearance of your marks. After a few months, the marks will fade and some are hardly noticeable. No matter what you do to prevent them, if it is in your DNA to get them you will get them.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	They're just like any other stretch mark if you've got them. They can take anywhere between a few weeks to fade to a year or more to fade. It just depends on the severity and how well you took care of them.<br>  <br>  Keep using the oils and lotions, that'll keep the itching down. And it will also help mature them a little bit. Time is the only thing that truly fades stretch marks.|`|zATQaiwIaa	unless you can afford surgery they are your "battle wounds" for life.<br>  <br>  Nothing will take them away that you can buy in a bottle, the time it takes for them to fade depends on the elasticity of your skin and how bad they are.|`|Y0uy51eVaa	use bio oil or cocoa butter

As long as the pain isnt excruciating and isnt associated with any bleeding then dont worry.|`|sidUEhbjaa	It could be braxton hicks.. kinda like labor pains. If the pain is radiating around your belly I would call the doctor for a check up just to be safe. They might just say, to rest and take tylenol which is probably the only thing that you can take when your pregnant.
8t8NjjnVaa	Ah yes.  If it's what I'm thinking it is, judging by your description and your doctor saying it will take months to go away, it is molluscum contagiousum (sp?).  <br>  <br>  It's caused by a virus that they can catch from just about anywhere.  The bumps will not hurt him, but they can spread.  It's very similar to warts.<br>  <br>  My daughter had one on her arm and we left it alone until more popped up.  Then I took her to the dermatologist.  I didn't want them spreading to her face!  <br>  <br>  A dermatologist can freeze it off or put a liquid on it that makes her body attack it.  It will get red and angry and may blister, then it goes away.  I struggled to eradicate these from my daughter with trips to the dermatologist for years.  Everytime we got some treated, new ones would appear!<br>  <br>  Your doctor said it can take months, but it also can take years!|`|1S7uXsInaa	Does it looked puss filled, like a large pimple?

DF2tiQ3uaa	Congrats and I hope you have a safe delivery, how ever it happens.<br>  1st of all If your baby is in a breech position they may have to do a cesarean, also be advised that the baby may not respond the way he/she should once you are induced. So prepare yourself for that cesarean. (That's what happened to me)<br>  as long as the baby is healthy (movements, heart beat, etc) inside of you they will most likely pick a time of day to get this done (not telling you). If not they will take actions within the 1st few hours of your arrival.<br>  <br>  Come prepared with your over night bag for the hospital.<br>  <br>  And best of Fortunes.|`|7KkTel7Oaa	usually for an induction you go into the hospital the night before and then they'll start the process. then, depending on how fast the baby pops out, you'll have her.|`|BIg5bWkMaa	i was induced 3 days after  the apt with my son my labor was 6 hous and then bam! brand new baby! he was born 1 day ahead of time at 40 weeks natural labor started on its own pitocin to help|`|euwbbibZaa	More than likely. I'd definitely be ready for it on your apt on the 5th.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	If she has a free spot to go ahead and do it that day, then they will. If not, she will probably clear her appts on the 4th and deliver you that day.|`|AA10478146	No, they'll schedule it when you have your appointment on the 5th.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Most first babies are late, so don't worry about that. I went through this exact same thing. I went to my Dr. on a friday and hadn't dilated or anything. Then they told me to come back Monday. I started having contractions that weekend and Monday I was dilated at 3 and was 20% effaced. They admitted me that night into the hospital and the next morning they induced labor by giving me Pitocin and breaking my water manually. It took 8 hours and Andrew was born. She will probably wait til after 41 weeks to induce, because you still haven't hit your due date yet. All doctors are different. Just call her and ask what she is going to do so you can be prepared. Make sure your bags are packed and you have all of your stuff taken care of before you go, just in case she wants to admit you right then adn there. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I don't think she will induce you on same day cause full term is between 37 to 41 weeks so she might wait couple more days. But if you really think she may plan to do it same day than I think you should call her day before your appointment and make sure so you can be prepared like with your  hospital bag and car seat in the car and rest of  the stuff.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	I'm have my a doctors appt on monday and i'm getting induced that day because my son is already 9lbs. My due date is the 5th. She will probably induce you at your next appt.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	You will probably be scheduled to come in the next day or later that day even, depending on your pregnancy and if your doctor is available.
LQuJj2y9aa	my dr told me it was my potassium. and i needed to eat lots of food with potassium. she also told me to do calf stretches before bed. this helps to loosen the muscles. i had them HORRIBLY with my first pregnancy and luckily this time i have not had them much. just make sure you are stretching and moving around enough so that clots do not form in your legs. eat lots of bananas...|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	My doctor put me on calcium supplements, he said the cramps may be due to the baby robbing calcium from my bones. So I take two 600mg capsules of calcium & vitamin D supplement. Also, low potassium and magnesium may cause cramping. The weight of your ever growing belly will cause some of your muscles to become strained too, and the baby may be on a nerve. I found that stretching my calf muscles before bed really helped, and putting a heating pad on them when they cramp works. But those cramps are to be expected in pregnancy, mine used to get so bad my whole leg would freeze up.|`|3Q9yiimsaa	Your body is lacking potassium, try and eat a banana everyday it helps a lot.|`|DTYHoinVaa	this is my first pregnancy without them, not sure why but they were hell.

H74F8jxuaa	You can only get pregnant like 5 days leading up to and including the day of ovulation.  No other time of the cycle can you get pregnant.  People who think they get pregnant when they aren't fertile is false because you can only get pregnant when you are fertile.  It could be that they just don't know exactly when they ovulated, which means they ovulated sooner or later than they thought.|`|YlLmAADraa	you cannot get pregnant when you are not ovulating. ovulating is the key to getting pregnant. thats like trying to drive with no engine in your car... it doesn't happen.<br>  there cycle itself my not be the same as the average person... but they would have had to been ovulating at the time they got pregnant.|`|zzVnKgWraa	The only way pregnancy occurs is when living sperm hits a living egg.  Sperm or egg can hang around for about 3 days each, so sex within 3 days before or after ovulation can resulf in pregnancy.  Most people may not know when they ovulate, but there are signs to look for such as slick, stretchy vaginal fluids and a spike in basal temperature.
AA10196172	First, it's only been 11 days. That's a little early for some tests. Most suggest wait until you are late, which really means about 14 days after sex.<br>  <br>  Second, ovulation usually(!) happens about 14 days before your period, so odds are you were safe. 22-15 = 7;  about a week after ovulation.  But nothing's guaranteed - ovulation can happen randomly sometimes.<br>  <br>  The home tests are not that sensitive. Occasionally they register negative when you are pregnant, if you don't make enough hGC to register on them. (hGC = pregnancy hormone). A doctor's blood test is much more sensitive.<br>  <br>  If you keep having several of the symptoms, (not just missed period) and the tests keep saying negative, then arrange for the doctor to do a blood test.|`|OhSu11W6aa	TAKE A TEST.... you need to look at an ovulation calendar and see where the 15th falls you may be Preg!!!
AA11524272	If you have a regular cycle then if you were expecting your period to occur on the 22 of this month and if it didn't occur then it might just be a delay which could be caused by several factors including stress. But, then if you have never had delays then it would be certainly not normal to have a delay. Delays can be as short as 2 or 3 days or as long as 10 days or more sometimes. It all depends on how regular and constant your cycle is.<br>  <br>  If you have a regular cycle and assuming your cycle is 28 days long, then if you had sex without protection on the 22 that would be at the end of your normal cycle so the probability of getting pregnant is very low. As a rule of thumb you can get an idea (just an idea) of your most fertile days by dividing the length of your cycle by 2 (that gives you 14 if your cycle is 28-days long), and then add and subtract 5 days so you end up with a 10-day "most fertile window". For example:<br>  <br>  Length of cycle: 28 days<br>  Divided by 2: 14 days<br>  Plus and minus 5 days: days 9-19<br>  That means that your most fertile days within your cycle would be from day 9 through day 19 of your cycle, so these are the dates when having sex without protection can actually be a high pregnancy risk activity. Having sex without protection would be of lower risk (still with some risk) during days 1-8 and 20-28 (I'm not say you shouldn't use protection these periods, there is still a risk but lower).<br>  <br>  If you take a test and it shows positive then there is a chance that you were indeed pregnant before the 22 (again, assuming 22 was day 28 of your period or the date when you expected your period to occur). In this case you really have to remember exactly what you did, how you did and when you did it, to know what happened.<br>  <br>  The most important thing now is to check if you're pregnant or not. My recommendation: wait 3 or 4 days more for your period to occur. If it doesn't occur then your best alternative is to take a test. <br>  <br>  If you had unprotected sex with different guys before the 22 and on the 22 then you may need to carefully review on a calendar the dates when you had sex to rule out who the father is (if you're pregnant). Still, most likely the guy you had sex with on the 22 would not be the father as it was very unlikely that you would have got pregnant on the 22 IF your cycle is regular. If your cycle is irregular then having unprotected sex is really a big risk, probably as big as the uncertainty of who the father would be if you had sex with different guys on different dates.<br>  <br>  Calm down now and wait a few more days before you take a test. If you can't wait then go and take the test now. Taking a test now or a few days later will not make a difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aZXnW6AUaa	See a doctor for more advice.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If you had sex on the 22nd the day your period is due, then you most likely missed your most fertile time and are not pregnant. It is too early to take a test, unless you had sex prior to the 22nd. Typically a woman ovulates 10-14 days prior to their period so if you had sex around that time then yes, take a test now as it is not too early for that one. <br>  <br>  Plan B is a pill that you can take within 72 hours of sex to prevent a pregnancy.|`|hfqUp1IBaa	Not necessarily your hormones change right after missed period so it is possible that it would show up from the 22nd!|`|cmvum8YDaa	you might be...you Might not be|`|Gyo0V4WRaa	plan B.|`|HSbcscbuaa	if ur period was on the 22 and u had sex yea u can get pregnet cus of the egg and if u have sex 15 days before ur period u will still get pregnet so if u dnt want to be pregnet thin dnt have sex 15days before ur period and u can have sex like 2 days after ur period and not get pregnet  and i also dnt know exactly when u had sex so i wouldnt know the other part of the question.|`|7hRZMmwSaa	You can get pregnant anytime, there really is no time you can't get pregnant because a sperm can live for a few days even without fertilizing anything.|`|IiqtPphEaa	Im pretty sure if it showed positive then you would have to have been pregnant before the 22nd.  Not many tests show positive 4 days after- maybe urine.|`|SoeIJmDhaa	day 22 is low risk
WQ8P57o3aa	I was spanked as a child and I see no problem with it. Never taught me any harm, certainly made me respect my parents though..I never would be rude to them incase I got punished and we have a very strong relationship. <br>  So yes spanking is fine, some mums just make such a big deal out of it.<br>  <br>  But I had clothes on!<br>  Your question is sick..I reported it!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	reported and btw im pretty sure that spanking a person under 7 would be classified as sexual abuse|`|BNNzCqhIaa	Spanking in my opinion is NEVER okay. I believe it teaches your child to learn to associate conflict resolution with violence. Your child should be disciplined in a manner that he or she understands what is wrong and then has the oppurtunity to use his or her words to talk it out with you. A successfull well adjusted child will be able to explain his feelings and express his frustrations verbally without needing to resort to violence. My brother and I were both physically disciplined and throughout our childhood we would physically fight all the time. This is what we were taught. If something was done wrong- hit the person to make it better. My brother went on to fight a lot in High School as well. Also, even if you do adopt the policy of spanking, it is child abuse to hit another parent's child. I would recommend evaluating your options of discipline and talking them over (if age appropriate) with your child. I am a live in nanny and their worst punishment is sibling separation (having to be in separate rooms from eachother). Before this is enacted we first try to talk through the conflict at first by themselves and if that does not work- with adult intervention. Good luck...I hope you see the negative consequences of hitting a child.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	I don't spank but my husband does when required.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 )|`|YuVSDBkzaa	OK, lots of questions. I find some of them really odd. Why would you even think about "spanking in front of a mirror so they can watch" or  "spanking in front of their friends"? That's just weird. First off, spanking isn't illegal (at least not in the USA) but it cannot be hard enough to leave a mark on the child. I rarely spank my child, only when she is being blatantly disobedient, particularly if she is doing something that will hurt her more than a spanking (i.e. not wearing her seat belt when she was told to put it on). She is only four and I doubt I will continue to spank for much longer as she is getting older. I absolutely do not believe in spanking older children, especially teenagers. Spanking the bare bottom is gross in my opinion. Sounds kind of perverted.
smsUZG4Iaa	there is definatly a good chance. your timing is good. i hope things go your way.. Best of luck|`|sIrCiDHcaa	let me tell you it is possible because i had the same thing happen to me awhile back in jan and feb .. it was like two weeks before my actual period should have been here yet i was experiencing symptoms and i got my hopes all up and then they got brought down by that negative then that god awful period.. so it is possible .. but wait and see and then take a test maybe get a blood test if your still unsure.. Good luck to you if you are trying to conceive
kU48K7ugaa	could be implantation bleeding - you'll have to wait.|`|k4x4uSNJaa	it could possibly be implantation bleeding!!! <br>  good luck and if it is Congrats!!!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	I'm TTC with my hubby before he goes to Iraq....soo we have 10 days out of 2 months...(he deploys may 1st)...you could be preg....i start 2 days before my period is schelduled to come....I would go to the gyno..
03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I feel the same way you feel.  I am a little over 36 wks with our first and I find myself worrying a lot about that.  I even sometimes have nightmares that something has happened to the baby.  Once the baby comes and is healthy I am sure I will feel much more relief.  Just try not to stress and worry.  I am sure everything will be ok.  Plus when you get to see that baby in an ultrasound.....that defiantly is some reassurance.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	OMG - are you kidding? I was SO nervous throughout my entire pregnancy. I thought, ok, if I make it 1 more month I'll feel better... I never did feel better. Whenever I didn't feel kicking I got nervous. I was nervous for every drs. appt. ... I was nervous throughout the delivery that something was gonna go wrong. I was nervous once she was born that something was gonna go wrong. And now shes 3+months old, I just worry! it never ends so get used to it!!! GOOD LUCK with your pregnancy and on being a MOM!  There's nothing in life like it!|`|gEWt6eoCaa	Not with my 1st. it wasn't until my second that I was worried all the time. the reason I think it was because my boyfriends cousin had a miscarriage right before I found out I was pregnant. I hated being around her cause I felt like it was rude. my doctor told me not to worry as long as the baby had a heartbeat and moving I was fine.<br>  Just relax everything will be fine. Good Luck!|`|f4AJHCHKaa	I think that every mommy worries about miscarriage. I know that I was super stressed until I got an ultrasound and actually saw that everything was ok, and my dr said so too! Don't worry, I'm sure that everything will be fine, just take care of yourself!! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!!|`|bnbXMlIpaa	I was the same way when i was pregnant with my son. He is now 3 months old and very healthy. you are going to have those worries but you have to try and not think about them they are just going to stress you out.. enjoy being pregnant it will be over before you know it..|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I am right there with you. I am so scared that something is going to happen to our baby. I swore off buying anything until after 5 months. Does it ever end though? Will we not worry about our babies after they are born?|`|xX0zKzw8aa	Yes, I think we all worry about having a miscarriage, but you have to think about the positives and continue taking as good of care of yourself and the baby as you possibly can.  Speak to your doctor about your concerns and he/she will be able to ease your mind throughout early pregnancy.  Even once your out of the clear so to speak there is still that gnawing feeling at the back of your mind that something can happen.  There is no difference to us worrying about getting in a car accident or our plane crashing while on a trip as it is for a miscarriage, it is a part of life that we may have to deal with, just try to look past these worries and do the best that we can to stay safe.
Ej2EOsvKaa	Hi. let me first say that I have not given birth yet (due date aug 15) anyways I have been talking to the person who knows about this (well my mom of course) and she said its bad if you make it bad. <br>  <br>  You have to be mentally ready, ( i study psychology and this is completely true) Of course there will be pain but if you always remember that in just a few hours your angel will be here then it wont be so bad.<br>  <br>  Contractions- from what I have read and heard, they feel like extremely bad menstrul cramps which we go through anyways so its something your somewhat used to. As long as you have someone there counting till the time is over you will be fine.<br>  <br>  Labor- That is probably the quickest part (unless lord forbit something go wrong) Of course you have the pushing which I can imagine is quite painful but you just brace yourself breath and your baby will be there as soon as you know it. GOod luck if you are preggo! whoo hoo<br>  <br>  :)|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Honestly, I didn't think it was that bad at all. It's funny though, because before I had my baby, I was actually looking on this site for the same answers you're looking for! SO many people on here were saying it was so terrible, and I was terrified. But I went into labor at midnight, and felt pretty much OK until I finally went to the hospital the next morning around noon. I could walk and talk and eat, it just felt like irritating menstrual cramps. As they got a little stronger, they still weren't that bad, but it felt better to walk around. I had an epidural, which I barely even felt, and then I felt WONDERFUL!!! The nurse does have to hold you kinda funny while they put the IV in your back though, to make sure you don't flinch too much and injure your spine with the needle, but other than that, it's not bad at all. The pushing part is more frustrating and annoying than it is painful, and this part is actually kinda gross...the nurse kept telling me to push every time I felt a contraction, so I did, and I was pushing like with my abs, which is what I figured was right...then the doctor kept yelling at me and telling me to keep pushing like I was trying to take the biggest poop (sorry for the lack of a better term, since that's not the word she screamed LOL) of my life! So there's another tip for you...pretend the baby is poop. That sounds awful, sorry. But anyway, it's not very bad, and it's all worth it!!!|`|bQTATDTyaa	I had 17 hrs of back labor which was pretty rough but more exhausting than painful.<br>  <br>  I had my baby at home with no meds at all. The pushing was easy because your body does the work, you don't even need to push just breath and relax your body does it all. With an epi you can't feel that so it's harder and more likely to take longer.<br>  <br>  If you want a hospital birth wait as long as possible because the longer you sit in there the easier it will be to say yes to meds, I knew I didn't want them but in the moment it's exhausting and would have been tempting.<br>  <br>  Def get mentally prepared, if you are afraid and tighten up or don't follow your body then you will hurt. I had to walk for 12 hours straight only leaning over my counter for breaks until I hit transition, felt the baby in the canal (about 4 hours before birth), and got the urge to take a bath, then I delivered standing because it felt right at that time. I was only in pain when I tried to lay down and not listen to my body.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Birthing hurts pretty bad, epidurals rock the world!! LOL! Ummm As for someone else's comment, I was 8cm dilated when I got my epidural and my friend was 10cm when she got hers. It used to be that you couldn't have a epidural any more once you were at 7cm but they will do it when ever now. I waited so long because I didn't feel the contractions or any kind of pain until i was at 8cm. But after that HOLY CRAP!! it hurt! So all women are different my friend had to have a epidural at only 3cm because she couldn't stand the pain!|`|532XA7lkaa	I had an epidural.  I got to 4 centimeters with no medication and began to hyperventilate and panic from the pain...it was unlike anything I had experienced (I've never broken bones or had any serious injuries to compare the pain to).  I had an epidural at that point...fell asleep....and they woke me up to push!  I pushed, it was painful because they decreased the medication so I could feel when to push, but totally bearable.  I'm glad I got it, it was worth every penny.  My baby was fine, now 3.5 years old and I am 15.5 weeks pregnant...and will have another epidural this time around.  Good luck, everyone is different...|`|gWiZAsfBaa	I did it with no drugs. The pushing and having the baby come out was not as bad as I thought. It actually goes faster then you think it does. It's the contractions that are the killer. I swear, I thought it would never end.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	You have to expect pain, but it's not as bad as many people say.  For some reason mothers who have given birth like to try to frighten those who haven't.  <br>  <br>  Don't be scared into having an epidural at the outset.  Start and see how you go.  Gas and air is wonderful for taking the pain away.  It's also known as entonox.  But you have to make sure you don't over use it or it could lose is efficacy.  As labour proceeds, your natural endorphins kick in and it gets easier.  In fact, I did the pushing stage without pain relief both times because I found it easier than trying to coordinate pushing with using the entonox, and I found I didn't need it anyway.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	Labor is not pleasant...the contractions can be miserable.  I planned to go completely drug free with my 1st, and did change my mind after experiencing the miserable contractions.  The birthing part itself is wonderful, you are getting your goal..your beautiful baby to be held in your arms...also this means it is almost over.<br>  <br>  I ended up getting the epidural both times and it worked great!|`|qahWKWmuaa	it is an indescribable horrible pain that feels like it is never going to go away or lessen but in the end it is so worth it so have fun and enjoy the new baby. <br>  <br>  epidurals if you want one get it early because once you are too dilated you can not get one any more
IiqtPphEaa	I would consult your doc.  I went into early labor at 16 weeks and felt nauseous and crampy.|`|AA10458750	Let me tell you, you are going to be uncomfortable for the rest of your pregnancy! At the stage you're at the pains you are feelign are most likely your uterus streching out. It could also be round ligament pain, which is felt in the pelvic area. Both are normal, the joys of carrying a baby!|`|Khs7HBYmaa	IM NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY CALL YOUR DOCTOR.|`|Cxdxo393aa	i just had a consult with my doctor.  ive had cramping since 5 weeks on a daily basis and my baby is perfectly fine and healthy now at 12 weeks, so she said its normal if youve been having it from the start just uteris expanding is causing.  BUT at your stage and just now starting, that can be a cause for alarm , but on the other hand she also mentioned while i was there that once a baby has an established heartbeat and around 12 weeks, those 2 facts combined dramatically lowers the chances of something going wrong.  but i would still check into it, always better to be safe than sorry!
RwoN3E9Uaa	You probably had a clogged duct and the clog came out.  If you previously had an infection than I would say it most positively was a clogged duct.  Pumping does not remove the milk entirely from the breast and you could open yourself up to clogs and infections all the time if you exclusively pump.  I really suggest that you nurse directly.<br>  <br>  You can still feed the baby the milk, it is not harmful.|`|deIzFnV8aa	I was trying to research this because I was curious and I couldn't find anything about it at all! I would not feed your milk to baby without consulting your dr first, since you don't know exactly what that is. If you still have some for the dr to see, I think that would help them determine what it is/what is wrong.<br>  <br>  Sorry this was not more helpful!
Ccq8zEcnaa	Try to wear a pregnancy support belt, this will help alleviate some of the discomfort you feel down there. As far as you getting winded, that's normal, the baby is pushing against your diaphragm and this makes you short of breath.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	yes lol i have felt the same thing it does feel very much like something is going to fall out suddenly and it is very weird and uncomfortable however it is normal and it is just because the baby is getting less and less room because it is growing and has not got as much room as what it did a while a go. it is just your baby pressing on all your insides inside of you lol i am 33 weeks and i get it allot, sometimes i feel like she is just going to fall out when i get up lol|`|BIDy92Dwaa	I get that feeling too! It kinda feels like something is squishing your cervix as if you have perod cramps.It's annoying ayh. Ive been having it for a few weeks now and im 27 weeks tomorrow :)<br>  I'm pretty petite and i've been experiancing shortness of breath too.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	Very normal, the closer you get to the due date, the bigger the baby and yes the bowling ball on your bladder. also the tiredness thing, normal too. Maybe your baby hasn't dropped yet and is still compressing your lungs or the baby is big.Best of luck!|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	I feel the same way.  I am on my first pregnancy and currently going on 37 wks and feel that way almost all the time.  I get short of breath easy as well.  I was thinking that it was just me.  I am glad to know that I am not the only pregnant woman going through this.
Ccq8zEcnaa	At least 12 times a day is what my doctor told me to look for.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	Well some babies will be active one day and not so much the next but you should still feel something every 20-30 minutes even if its a little kick.  Have you been active most of the day?  That could be why you haven't felt her much.  I recommend drinking something cold and/or sugary and sit or lay down and see if you can feel that baby within about 20 minutes.  If you can't then I recommend calling the doctor or going to the hospital.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I am 6 months and I feel my baby move a lot.  But sometimes she isn't very active like she usually is.  My doctor told me they are just like us and have their active days and there lazy days.  If you really get concerned drink a little juice and she should start moving.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Im 7 months as well & I feel my baby move all the time. But there are sometimes that I dont feel her for a while because she is lazy & sleeps all day I guess. As long as you feel her move atleast a little bit I would say your fine. Try finding where she is & pushing on her to see if she moves. If not I guess call your DR & see what they say.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I just went to the ER a few days ago. I hadn't felt her move in 10 hours. I even tried Mt. Dew and nothing. Anyway she was fine! <br>  <br>  The nurse said to expect 10 movements within 2 hours of eating. We don't know why she wasn't moving. <br>  <br>  Babies sleep to, she said. Try some cold water and laying on your left side. =)|`|cSm1zod4aa	I am 6 months and my doctor told me I should feel my baby move 10 times every 1-2 hours, keeping in mind there are going to be a couple hours when he is sleeping. I hope this helps, but you may want to ask your doctor. Good Luck!|`|AA11208683	i would call your doctor right away you could be having the baby early... but here is something that might help a little.<br>  count your kicks....<br>  try laying down on your side, check the clock and start counting ( count anything, kicks, flutters, swishes, rolls) stop counting when you reach 10 and note the time. often you will feel 10 movements withing 10 minutes or so sometimes it will take longer. if you haven't counted 10 movements by the end of an hour have some juice or a snack, walk a bit, even jiggle your belly a little, then lie back down relax and continue counting if two hours go by withour 10 movements, call the doctor. an absence of activity doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. when the baby drops you are going to feel less kicking then before. call your doctor though just to be safe.... good luck|`|rMgnmMN9aa	Honestly while pregnant with my son I NEVER felt him move, maybe twice in my whole pregnancy and that's the truth! He must have done it while I was asleep or something. However, if you normally feel her move and all of the sudden she's not and you have pain, my suggestion is call your doctor for sure, it is most likely nothing, but always better safe then sorry when it comes to your child. Good Luck!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	At 28 weeks you should start fetal count, usually it is 10 kicks within an hour. I've read sometimes that it is 10 kicks in 2 hours. I've always counted the kicks within the 1 hour time frame.<br>  <br>  If you notice a decrease in movement, relax. Grab cold water or juice, soda.. anything. Drink a full glass and have a muffin or a cookie. Lay down on your left side and wait for an hour. The baby should wake up from the sugar rush and the lack of movement which can sooth him/her to sleep. If after a few more hours, nothing is working then you need to contact your OB or L&D and explain to them the situation. More likely be asked to come in so they can evaluate the situation properly.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	keep alert, if there's still no movement by tonite, call your Dr, they're supposed to move every day.
5N3odm3Qaa	A few corrections to some answers on here:<br>  <br>  1. Starting at age 14, your parents no longer have any right to your medical information. Everything that happens to you after you turn 14 is completely confidential. You're covered under HIPAA laws and nobody can violate this. At 17, you can go anywhere you want.<br>  <br>  2. Lab work (like bloodwork and such) will usually run about $15. Not $100 for someone young who is just getting standard bloods drawn. By the way, just from standard blood work they will test you for seemingly every last bit of information, from cholesterol to pregnancy to diseases.<br>  <br>  Your local community hospital has a clinic which will be of very little cost to you, regardless of whether or not you have insurance.<br>  <br>  Any medical center or university hospital would be fine but you can also go to Planned Parenthood. At PP, they use a sliding scale for payment so some things might be free to you if you have no insurance (or don't tell them that you do) and have very little to no income.<br>  <br>  Go to PlannedParenthood.com and do a search for locations near your zip code.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|SRzswqTeaa	There a lots of doctors to choose from, but how do you plan to pay to see them?  Even if they do see you without your parent's consent, you still have to come up with about a hundred dollars a visit.  That doesn't even pay for the lab work.  If you are young, and you plan on keeping this baby, your parents will find out soon anyway.  This is an adult situation, and you have to be ready to do the adult thing - and that is face up to them.

And trust me, if you were having twins, you would know it by now. Your doctor would have noticed that your fundal height was way more than it should be for one baby, and they would have heard more than one heartbeat. I have heard of the doctor missing a twin early on but at some point the other twin would reveal himself, ESPECIALLY by week 27. <br>  <br>  I doubt you're having twins.

wTYh7DiSaa	Precum’s main purpose is cleaning the urethra from any bacteria or the leftovers of urine, also precum is a lubricant that is used for lubrication of the glands and foreskin during the intercourse. Depending on the person precum may or may not contain small amounts of spermatozoids, the chances of pregnancy are small but, since in theory, only one sperm is enough to get a woman pregnant there’s still a chance that the pregnancy will happen. It would be the safest to use condoms during the entire duration of the sexual intercourse.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Changes are pretty slim, I wouldn't be worried. Wait to see if she misses a period before you worry. <br>  Prec** CAN contain sperm, Anytime.
GZn5VNlSaa	Apparently it's routine to do a pap smear on your first prenatal visit.  I'm not sure about them though!! I'm still skeptical on them because that much pressure on your cervix can lead to uterine contractions. I'm not blaming paps for miscarriages but i had one right after i had my pap smear. most people swear it wasn't the pap, but i beg to differ.<br>  <br>  Highly unlikely that you're having twins, the HCG rises drastically every couple of days if everything is fine.  Yours sound like a singleton pregnancy.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	my doctor done a pap smear on me when i was around 9 weeks its very normal to spot after one...and ur HCG levels will double everyday.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	If you were 6 weeks along they wouldnt of done a pap test as it involves going into your cervix to do a swab. your cervix is shut by now.<br>  Also that exam would of jsut been a pelvic exam you are thinking of, and the spotting would of been from just a little bit of a scrape on the side of your vaginal wall, nothing to be worried about, it happens.<br>  <br>  And your hcg lvls has nothing to do wtih you having twins. where do people get this crap from? lol. From week to week your hcg lvls are auposed to increase dramatically.|`|mbGOEZSAaa	Yes it is ok. My doctor did one on me when I was pregnant and I spotted a little afterward. I wasn't worried though because she told me I would. I am surprised he didn't warn you that may happen so you wouldn't worry.<br>  As far as twins go, I don't have an answer on that one.Sorry.<br>  Good Luck!|`|I6vMxEU9aa	The doc is allowed to do a pap test in your pregnancy, and it's normal to spot after having the test done.<br>  <br>  I don't know a thing about HCG levels. Sorry!|`|4FQKWxB9aa	Yes they're suppose to do a "pelvic exam" unless you had other reasons for having a pap.....<br>  I don't know your chances for having twins... sorry!<br>  Good Luck|`|SH07M84maa	If you told your doctor that you were pregnant, I don't think he should have done a pap test unless there was a good reason (like your previous was abnormal and you were due for a follow up.). What was the reason for the pap test? Don't worry about the pink spottiing - as long as it goes away after a day or so and doesn't become heavier.<br>  <br>  I have had three babies, and never had a pap test done during the pregnancies.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure about the hcg lvl - but I wouldn't have thought that hcg lvl would be greater if you were having twins.|`|28ux28S0aa	I don't know about the twins, but I do know that whenever I would have any vaginal exam when I was pregnant I was told by the doctor that there may be a little spotting afterwards. If that is the case, then I would not get too stressed, but if it is anymore than a little bit then I would contact your doctor quickly|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	I had a pap at the beginning of both of my pregnancies, the pink is probably because of the test, if it went away you shouldn't worry.<br>  About the twin question i really have no info, sorry.|`|8vTpcyPOaa	I ad a pap smear when I was pregnant, and yes sometimes after they poke and prod in there during your many doc visits you may bleed afterwards, which is normal. Just not masses amounts, then I would be concerned. As for the hcg levels, I have no clue.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	yes, they often do a pap if it's needed while you are pregnant. bleeding or spotting after a pap is also normal, as your cervix is much more sensitive now that you are pregnant. i dont know about the twins thing, but that is a high jump, maybe|`|SfludeD5aa	I'm not sure about the twin thing, but I've had three kids and had a pap smear at the beginning of each, and yes it's normal to spot some after that.|`|7e73cc3fb4946100fb427133734cb471aa	yes it normal you get a lot more than just one done while you are pregnant. you are probably stressed out and need to relax.|`|I4aTlL4Faa	Is perfectly fine just let him now.

CIZjK2rAaa	Cervical Mucus.  When you ovulate, you have stretchy cervical mucus that is almost like egg whites.  It helps carry the sperm to its destination.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	Centimeter.  It's a metric unit of measure that is a little less than 1/2 an inch.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry- I should have noted that this question was in "Trying to Conceive" not general "Pregnancy & Parenting."<br>  <br>  Centimeters aren't important until delivery!|`|h1q1tnHGaa	Cervical Mucus|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Cervical Mucus lol took me awhile to get used to the words|`|VS8mactUaa	Cervical Mucus, its the gooey stuff that excretes from your vagina, it can be clear or cloudy white, other colors may be an indicator to something, like infection.|`|ABOvm38Caa	It's cervical mucus.  You usually see an increase in it when you are ovulating.
Xc02z608aa	I refuse to watch any show that has an interview with Nadya Suleman on.  I don't wish to support her in what she has done.  If she didn't want the eggs destroyed (which I can understand) she could have always sold them or donated them to organizations that "adopt" out fertilized eggs with no home.  <br>  <br>  SHE approached "Access Hollywood" and said if you pay me _______ money, I'll do an interview.  They turned her down FLAT.  They then went on to state that they would NOT be doing ANY coverage on the Octomom.  Join me in banning her from the media!  She's just after money.<br>  <br>  An orginization called Angels in Waiting, which is all volunteers and nurses, offered to step in and help her with her eight babies and she refused their help. <br>  <br>  I don't agree with what she did.|`|AbPb0C7eaa	I don't think she CHOSE to have octuplets... she was doing fertility treatments and was probably prepared for twins, etc... but she's one of the few people in the world to have 8 at once so I don't think even she knew what was coming!<br>  <br>  At the same time, I can't say she's bad or horrible or it was a wrong choice... because babies, even 8 of them with a questionable mother, cannot be horrible or a mistake. And I think the best place for them to be, right now at least, is with their mother.<br>  <br>  I disagree with Beauty that she's just in it for money. The very first day the story came out, she didn't wish to release her identity, because of everything that everyone is now saying about her. And if she's being used for national conversation, she at least deserves the compensation for interviews to help raise those precious ones.|`|lVIdENvqaa	I think she made a very bad decision to have 14 children without having a steady income and help with their raising.<br>  The general feeling from many is that she is going to bilk the govt. to raise her children and that is not right in these hard times we are going through.<br>  She may have done this for the publicity and hopefully she can make enough through that to support herself and the children, but probably not.<br>  Anyone who goes to the extreme of doing something is likely looking for attention. <br>  Well, she got the attention, for sure.|`|TczFL0p0aa	ok because you JUST heard about her i will answer but other then that its like move on her octuplets are a month old! like holy.<br>  ok first off some things the magazines dont state is that she tried from the age of 21 to have kids 7 years! she tied and had 4 single births and then twins, so 6 and then wanted 1 more, her chances of conceiving one were very low never mind twins and beyond that was .0000001% going to happen but hey it did now shes making the best out of this situation. she wanted 7 not 14, she has gone to school and is going back in the fall, she does not have a steady income no but she will find a way, i have NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER with people having kids single like wth if we all waited to have kids until we met someone some people would NEVER have babies, and she rents a home from her mom she does not live with her mother.<br>  She's trying her best and I believe in her, stop hating people and most of you don't have all the facts.<br>  peace out and everyone let it go! move on! it's been a month!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	at first i didnt have much of an opinion but now she just disgusts me. why in the world would you even do fertility treatments knowing you already have 6 kids that you can hardly care for. her 'intentions' may be good...she does love her children and its not exactly her fault she cant work (work injury) but she did know that her income was limited and she no longer had a husband to help her. why she would willingly put herself in that position i have no idea. she should have focused on the children she already had and making a better life for them. living with their grandparents is not ideal!|`|8N4aPcpaaa	she wants her 10mins of fame and guess what shes getting it...her mama takes care of those kids i think if anyone donates money it should be to the grandma and kick that crazy ***** of a daughter the **** out her house<br>  wow if shes not in it for the money why is she asking for donations come on now and if she always wanted 7 kids the ***** should of had a job and a mind to afford them duuuuuuhhh|`|AA10888290	I have nothing good to say about her and even less to say about the quack doctor I feel is the one who is really responsible.  Her kids should go to foster care where they have half a chance of getting decent parents.|`|JwhbTxETaa	i cant spo thinking of how hard it must be for her, its her fault, but putting all that aside, i cant stop thinking of how shes planning to do it!|`|EOM46GQHaa	She was crazy to decide to have 14 children considering her circumstances, but it was her choice.  The only problem I have with her is trying to use her children to solicit donations to fund her poor planning.  I also have seen photos of her before her appearance on the Today Show and I believe she had some cosmetic procedures performed on herself. I don't think that was the wisest thing to spend money on when she has 14 mouths to feed and no job.  Personally, I can not wait for her to stop appearing in magazines and on tv.|`|WThYT17Iaa	The mother is completely irresponsible and selfish. She hasn't even began to consider the children and how much love and attention each child needs. She openly admitted that she is having children to fill a void in her life. Geez woman, get a dog or something. <br>  Mainly, I feel bad for the children because they won't be the individual love and attention that they need to develop emotionally and mentally.|`|YGJqnzd5aa	What she did was very irresponsible and cruel to her children and her mother. Her mother is already the main person who cares for her other six children, and now there is fourteen! She was not prepared financially or emotionally so surviving the next 18 years will be extremely hard on her and her poor mother.<br>  What she did was stupid!|`|z8YGEk0qaa	I think she is a dumb bitc* who does nothing but bring mentally disabled children into the world at the expense of others and the poor economy.....|`|pXSKSS3daa	You just heard about her? Wow....<br>  <br>  I'm actually TIRED of hearing about her. What's done is done.|`|ytE1q20taa	I think good on her, fair play to being able to have so many kids *applause*<br>  EDIT: To smokin, that was a really nasty thing to say, why would you be so horrible about something/one like that?|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It doesn't matter what I think of her choice.<br>  <br>  Any mother of high order multiples needs assistance.  And every child deserves a good life<br>  <br>  I would hope that no mom ever has to worry about affording diapers, food, shelter or clothes.  Particularly moms of high order multiples who are under far more than an ordinary amount of stress, and I certainly can't fault someone for not having selective reduction even though I am pro-choice.<br>  <br>  If anyone can spare anything to make the life of any child, hers or otherwise, easier they should find it in their heart to do it.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	Not to mention she's living with her mother in a 3 bedroom house...with 6 kids much less 14. She's crazy! And they should have given her a psychic evaluation before allowing her to be inseminated with more.|`|ABOvm38Caa	She is a disgrace!  I feel horrible for those poor children.|`|x7vTKP24aa	bored with it. on to the next exciting thing
PRQyeOHUaa	I have heard that too, however I've also heard that's a myth. Try to drink A LOT of water, so your milk doesn't dry up.|`|AA11783671	Too much weight loss and not taking in enough calories can weaken your milk supply.  Talk to your doctor, but also be prepared to eat like crazy if you're working out alot.  I lost everything I'd gained from pregnancy both times within 6 wks by just breastfeeding and no exercise.  Breastfeeding takes lots of calories to look it up or talk to the doctor about what you should be eating to keep the milk supply up.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I want to work out like crazy myself after my baby is born. I am going to ask my doctor about it and so should you.<br>  <br>  I am sure it would make us very hungry since we have to nourish our bodies and provide milk for our babies, but we will have to wait and see won't we?|`|lBRzCIPQaa	I believe the concern is that it can decrease your milk supply with too much exercise. Plus it makes the breastmilk taste different.|`|ioZeveazaa	All these answers are good however this is definitely a question to ask your pediatrician. I would suggest supplementing with formula along with breastfeeding and make sure your baby is gaining weight. Good luck!!|`|kzyEuRroaa	I have heard that a safe amount to lose is 1-2 lbs a week, although more if for a short time (3-5 lbs/week for say 2 weeks, etc).  Any more than that and it can release toxins, as well as increase lactic acid in your breastmilk.  Some say that their babies won't feed well after they work out, possibly due to the build up of lactic acid, but it is not proven yet.  The other downfall of quick weight loss is that it can truly affect your milk supply, so that is another reason to do it at a moderate pace.  <br>  <br>  If the workouts make you feel great, and you are still within a safe range of weight loss each week, I say go for it.  You should make sure you still maintain enough calories (at least 1800 a day) to assure your supply doesn't drop, and your weight doesn't plummet too fast. You may want to go high intensity for only 3-4 days a week, and the other days just walking or light intensity, that way your body can rest and you can adjust.   Good luck!!
otFCWMuUaa	yes is it safe..
264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	I went through that for a VERY long time.  My daughter is now 13 months and she's been sleeping in her own crib for about 2 months now.  What we finally had to do was just set up  a routine and stick to it 6:30 dinner, 8:00 upstairs for a bath, 8:15 nurse to sleep, 8:30 music on and in crib either asleep or awake.  Then what we had to do was just let her cry.  It took about a week, but now for the most part she goes right to sleep when I lay her down and usually sleeps till about 4am, then she comes in with me because I can't seem to get her back down.  But once that routine is established and it's what your baby is familiar with it works wonders!  Good Luck!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	not his own room <br>  try him in your room <br>  i am in the process of moving my son into the crib <br>  hes six months <br>  <br>  make sure he is out when u put him down and lay him down <br>  swaddle him <br>  if he starts to wake up give him his binky <br>  <br>  <br>  i would do the crib in your room or u sleeping in his room for a lil bit <br>  its alot on them <br>  <br>  i move my bed really close to the crib so he feels comfortable <br>  i also put a rolled up blanket under the mattress so its on an incline like the seats would be|`|deIzFnV8aa	Here are some ideas you can use:<br>  <br>  let him spend some awake time in his crib to get used to it<br>  <br>  start withi naps in the crib<br>  <br>  wear a small blanket in your shirt for a few hours, roll it up, and put it in his crib so it smells like you<br>  <br>  use white noise and swaddling to help his sleep while in his crib. swaddling or a sleep sack will also help prevent the cooler sheets from waking him up when you first put him down.<br>  <br>  pick him up long enough to calm him down, but then return him to his crib. try using verbal soothing, pats, etc before picking him up. this is a great age to start  helping baby soothe them selves to sleep anyway<br>  <br>  if you don't have a bedtime routine and consitent bedtime yet, start one. after a few days he will start being sleepy at the end of the routine<br>  and may accept a new sleeping place more easily.|`|Xc02z608aa	Let him fall asleep in his bouncy seat and move him to his room, bouncy seat and all.  When he is used to that, come nap time, have bouncy seat already in his room and put him to sleep in his room but in his bouncy seat.  When he gets used to that, try putting him to sleep in his crib.|`|igJJ37Tjaa	Start during the day...that way he starts to get use to sleeping in the crib.<br>  Also my daughter will only sleep on her tummy, I know they say no, but her doctor said it was okay.  Of course she has a strong head so I don't worry.|`|oem5yEUDaa	I had my daughter take all her naps during the day in her crib for a week before. It worked really well.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My pediatrician told us that it's hard but you have to just let them go to sleep on their own in their crib. Then they'll associate the crib with sleeping. It really wasn't that hard. It took one week and now for naps or bed time all I have to do is put her in her crib. She's out on her own in 5 min. If he cries just let him cry and keep checking on him. Get him on that verge of sleep before putting him in there. He'll eventually learn to self soothe and then not only will he sleep in his crib but he'll sleep through the night. Our daughter started sleeping through the night when we did this because she learned to self soothe and when she woke up through the night she'd put herself back to sleep.<br>  <br>  Also you don't want to keep putting him to sleep by rocking or in bouncy seat. And most def not on the boob or bottle! (that's the worst, doc showed me pics of their teeth if you do this gross!) If you continue to put him to sleep that way that's the only way he'll want to, no matter how you try to wean him. I mean if he falls asleep and then moved to the crib it doesn't help him at all.
1JbdCRdtaa	I had the same problem as you. It took my husband 2 1/2 years to get pregnant with our first and we were 24 and 26. There was no rhyme or reason for why we were not getting pregnant.Eventually I had to use fertility drugs to get my babies.  My advice to you would to be to get a semen analysis for your husband and go to your OBGYN  and have them do a progesterone check to see if you are ovulating. Another great thing to do is get the book  "taking control of your fertility" it teaches you the signs of your body for when you are ovulating. It was such an interesting book. And I know people will tell you <br>  "don't worry, it will happen" If you really want that baby go to your OBGYN and find out whats really going on.  HUGS!

If you want to keep your baby then keep it, other wise you will regret it until the day you die. If your man leaves you then he will still have the obligation to take care of his child whether he likes it or not. It is so sad and so hard to go through. I went through it with my ex. He tried to make me have an abortion and I wouldn't so he left me. It is hard being a single parent but doable. You need to follow your heart and not let his words dictate what you decide to do|`|1aHchY9raa	your boyfriends crazy to consider that, if he's already left you? and your only making 11 an hour, i mean how could you afford two children, i feel sorry for you. i wouldnt abort the baby though, i wouldnt be able to look my first child in the eye, knowing he/she couldve had a sibling.. after this one, id say be extra careful next time. and i doubt your boyfriend will permanetly leave you, he just needs to relax and quit fussing, and if he love's you, later.. he'll come back and realize how stupid he is for doing what he did. Usually some people just need to get away, perhaps he needs a break. Figure out what to do in the mean time, and take care of your babies, even the one in your tummy.|`|LbBiT7rLaa	don't get any abortion let your baby exprience life, and take responibility of being a parent if ur boyfriend to selfish and irresponible of taking care of what he took part in making then forget about him move on find someone new that can take on responbility, and after all i hope u make the right decision, good luck|`|4WNeBRjVaa	It seems like a stinky situation and I'm sorry. I wish your man was a better supporter. <br>  I personally would keep the baby. You made it, you keep it. If this guy wants to throw and ultimatumum like that at you over the baby you made together, he isn't worth much. <br>  <br>  Good luck I really hope you the best|`|yrF1q1mdaa	that's ridiculous of him to say that! have the kid even if its too soon and tell him to leave if he can't deal with it. He's asking you to chose between your kids and him so which is more important to you??? I would hope your kids!|`|AA11661793	Tell him to grow a set be a man and take responsibility for his actions.|`|zBz10IiOaa	i'd kick his asss to the curb and get him for child support you can do it on your own!|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	First, you'll need to get your hands on a time machine...|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	i would tell him to stop being a jerk and take care of his responsibilties|`|PvnnWE1Baa	I'm happy that youve decided to keep the baby. You don't have to worry about him, can you say "Child Support Check"?|`|vdCHmoXkaa	**** if you want the baby have the baby<br>  and if you need help<br>  child support will gladly take money from his dumb ***<br>  <br>  do what you think will make you happy...<br>  Exept Abortion...|`|AA11129622	let him leave, you need someone that will support you, especially now you are gonna have two kids :)<br>  <br>  it will be hard but you dont want a jerk in your babies' lives xxx|`|6ycnSoaRaa	I agree with everyone..... I would cuss his a** out. He sure didn't have a problem doing the deed. Yes it might be scary having two babies so close together in age- but it can also really be a great thing too. I was always raised to remember that babies are brought to us as blessings- no matter how messed up the circumstances may be. (Trust me- I know, that's why I'm 15 weeks pregnant now) Just remember, that little one that you are carrying doesn't have a voice- it only has you. You are a woman and we have done many things without men before. Take my advise, keep your beautiful child, and ditch that sorry a** excuse for a boyfriend..... you will find a special person out there that will love your two babies- as they were his own. Good Luck and God Bless!<br>  <br>  <br>  If you would like to know my story I've got one posted and would love to hear your advise on that!|`|z6DxGzgGaa	I see you said adoption is not an option, but it might be the only at this point. If you cannot support it, it would not be fair to the child. I really do not believe in abortion, and see that you put it is not an option. There are thousands of women waiting for a healthy baby and would probably pay doctor bill and support you through the process. I just think to give your second child a chance, that it might be worth looking into. As for your boyfriend, thats childish. It takes 2 to tango and I am sure he was not against making the baby. I hope you make a wise decision and I will say a prayer for you!|`|G6lxr625aa	Keep this baby.  You will regret it if you don't.  This guy does not sound good, and if for some reason you break up, you will be so angry that you gave up a baby for him.  Your children are more important.  How will you explain this to your 5 month old, when he or she is older.  Give your baby a sibling.  You are in a tough situation, but you can make it.  Please, look at your 5 month old, this is a baby in you, just as your 5 month old grew in you.  Children are a blessing and a gift from God, I am sorry your boyfriend doesn't understand that.<br>  <br>  It is also safer for you to have this child then to abort it.  He is not thinking of your health and your well-being.  No man is worth giving up your children for.|`|Jc3oONAhaa	Well you sound like a great woman that man is a stupid irresponsible jerk just leave him because if he doesn't care for the baby then he doesn't care about you i think you should just leave him you can make it on your own i know its going to be hard but you can do it get him into child support besides their alot of programs out their that can help you so dont give up and just do what your heart tells you to do.|`|HbraP1cpaa	Well your boyfriend is a LOSER. Keep your child. He HAS to pay child support. And its never too soon, you'll have your hands full girl, but you can do it. The good Lord put both these children in your life for a reason. <br>  My daughter was just 12 months when I found out I was pregnant again, and I was SHOCKED. It will work out girl, just keep trucking!|`|xXMUyCalaa	keep it..look for a better job..keep the one u have while lookin tho, um keep the baby no matter what if he leaves hes a piece of **** and u deserve better anyway, if he leaves u and trys coming back to u and the baby tell him to go on somewhere, get on WIC and welfare if u really need help and maybe family can help?|`|zgw9sW84aa	sounds like you have already made up your mind. your bf sounds like a jerk|`|P64PoWkYaa	I can understand your situation...first off, it sounds like your bf is a jerk. If he didn't want to take on responsibilities of helping you with his offspring than he should have been more careful of the situation. plus, if he enjoys sleeping with you but doesn't understand the very obvious consequences than he's really immature and clearly irresponsible and maybe it would be better off if you weren't with him (that's just my opinion and not something to offend you). <br>  <br>  The decision is really up to you and if you think you can handle it than by all means go ahead but if you know that this is something you can't do alone, can't survive, can't financially/physically/emotionally etc. deal with than rethink of your options. If you're against abortion, don't do it. If you want to have the baby but you know you can't keep it you have options to turn to....even if you're against the idea...adoption is better than abortion and at least you are being responsible with your situation.|`|v8Jw4wRPaa	There are many virtues in this situation: the possibility of a wonderful child, and finding out your boyfriend's true colours, being two of them. The first thing you need to do is take control and break up with that horrible man. He obviously doesn't realise that a child is made mutually and that joint decision-making and joint responsibility come into play. That means you both have a say in what to do with the child, but ultimately your word is final because you have to carry the child for nine months. As for responsibility, he may think that he won't have anything to do with the child, but he will be legally responsible to pay child support once it is born. Secretly take down all his personal details (full name, DOB, hometown) now so that if it comes to taking him to court, you can do it. On an income such as yours, it would be a terrible struggle to support two young children otherwise.<br>  <br>  You say you know it is too soon to have the child but that abortion or adoption are not options, so it seems like you have already made your decision. I'm sure your first child is a fantastic joy in your life, especially for being so advanced. However, it is worth considering abortion or talking it over with a specially trained counsellor and/or health care provider. I know it is controversial to say so, but it won't make you any less of a person, and having this baby could do you a lot of financial and psychological harm. I am not necessarily advocating this but I don't think you should immediately write it off when you're on a low income, potentially with no suppporting partner, and already caring for a young child.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you need some real TLC, and a pregnant woman should definitely be getting that. Leave your boyfriend, go to stay with your best friend, your parents, or someone you feel close to and comfortable with. It's heartbreaking that you're having to ask this question online, and the people who know you best will have the best advice.<br>  <br>  I really hope that whatever decision you make, things turn out well for you.
CKnHMYHnaa	Join the club. There's hundreds of thousands of members.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Hundred million gazillion dollar question.|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	same here Ive heard that once u stop trying than you will have luck. so lots of baby dust to you!|`|04ZBuoqWaa	Pretty much the only thing you can do is keep trying. Have you been to the doctor to check and make sure you can have children? My husband and I have been trying for almost 2 years. I thought something was wrong, but turns out I'm pregnant. Good luck!|`|14RzmDTmaa	i have heard that when you stop trying is when it happens. so good luck and tons of baby dust.
hIzQyflqaa	i get that now, im 29wks, its baby shocking your cervix, its a horrible feeling!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	its a strong baby....its going to be a good soccer player...you are rally far along, so if it does feel like coming out then yo uhave nothing to worry about...|`|2RNFbJAPaa	With my son it felt like he was trying to stand up in there - I would get a sudden pain as he stretched out and thumped his head into my pelvis.  When he kicked, friends sitting on the other side of the room could see my stomach move!  When he was born he had a red ring around his head where he had crashed into my pelvis so often!  He was born exactly when he was due.....  PS I was not a pregnant man despite my profile name!|`|AA10468184	If you are talking about really low, shocking pain by your cervix, usually this is the baby's head rubbing against the cervix.  It hurts, I know but is normal.  Good luck!
SPMr3ZJFaa	Ok they are right...TECHNICALLY there is a CHANCE you could be pregnant.  But probably no more chance than if you had taken the pill...you went 8 days instead of 7 without the pill...no big deal.  So don't stress out.  I mean if you miss your next period..then take a test.  It's not like you eggs are just sitting there going, 'she's supposed to take the pill at 6 o'clock...if she forgets, i'm outta here at 7."  so while there is a chance...I would literally bet my own money that you aren't.|`|kvYgopThaa	You can get pregnant even when your on the pill so yes there is a chance you can be pregnant even if you did not miss the pill.|`|YFPMcHCbaa	unprotected sex=chance of pregnancy. Take a test.|`|8EeVtXv9aa	The chances of pregnancy are very very slim, you have been on birth control and just missed one day and then went straight back on! however you could just take a preg test when your period is due and see what happens but i dont think you need to waste the money i dont think theres a chance hun. all the best anyway and be careful next time :) xxx
nYZLtPE8aa	You better hope you are married. I do not know if you are married, or not. But, if you are not, make wiser choices and abstain from having sexual intercourse. You do not want that poor child growing up in that kind of environment. I grew up in the environment, and life is really hard on me and my mother. :'( If so you are married, congratulations! You might be pregnant. Please consult your doctor.|`|yyIVrngcaa	since you skipped a few, then stopped, yes, it could still be the B.C. take a test to be sure or go see your OBGYN|`|BnistnrIaa	getting off the pill and  being irregular with it can cause major stuff to your body especially your hormones girl!|`|Iqh7U5Ypaa	people are right about what they say.<br>  but it depends totally on your body, it may not affect you at all if you mess up a bit with your birth control (period wise) <br>  <br>  if your worried about getting pregnant then don't do anything sexual unles you use other forms of protection too! <br>  it can take around 3 days to get your cycle back to normal if you miss a pill or 2, maybe longer or shorter amounts of time.|`|TD9Ew3MZaa	That's true. I had a friend who took birth control... when she got off of it, she had her period for atleast 4 months, if not more. Afterwards she was very irregular, but still had the symptoms.|`|8HoSUgMXaa	yes
4e67Pdfvaa	swoosh salt water too... it know it tastes terrible but it helps|`|kVIOtS5gaa	If it is causing you pain you can take Tylenol. It is considered safe during pregnancy.
OgzHcNMsaa	My cousin's baby started holding his own bottle and feeding himself from 2 months but it depends on the baby.  Breastfed  babies do it later. My friend breastfed until almost a year...so at 15 months, her son still can't hold his own bottle. She will do it in her own time.  There's no right age.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	she could feed herself food at 6 months. with a spoon at 14 months with some success. a bottle, idk. she only got bottles with dad when i was at work. i think he said she was about 8-9 months when she would hold it on her own|`|BypjotRpaa	my son didn't start to self feed until 7 months old,and held his bottle at 6 months|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	We used the avent bottles when i was pumping  (he made me too sore right off, but i was able to at about 3 months)  and they make handles and sippy nipples for their bottles.  he was able to hold his own as a bottle with handles at about 4 months.  he mostly just played with it though since it wasn't milk.  he started feeding himself finger foods recently and he's 7 months now.  there's no really set age, but mine was able to at around 4 months with the handle.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	wow~ it's fast for your baby. My baby can drink sippy cup now but not always. It's more like a play toy for her. She likes to eat the gerber finger food - looks like cheerios. She tries to eat it but it sticks to her hand somewhere & she can't find it. By the way, my girl's 8 month old. I think mine's kind of slow at taking new food because she still like breast milk from me the best.|`|qjDxKXENaa	my daughter is nearly 7 months and she doesnt hold her bottle. she holds small food in her hand and puts in her mouth. i guess every baby is different.|`|NVP7CAhJaa	my son is almost 8 months ( in 3 days). He started to hold his bottle when he was 4.5 months but he would get lazy and not hold it. now i will hand him his bottle and he will feed himself but then he'll drop it on purpose i'll put it back in his mouth and hell act like he doesn't know how to hold it. it is to get my attention i  think. i almost always hold him and feed him but every now and again i'll put him in his crib or play pen to go down for a nap. so i answered more than your question but i felt like sharing.|`|jWl19O37aa	my son held his own bottle at 6 mos and feeds himself with a spoon at 16 mos|`|mAxChwHTaa	my son is 6 months and holds his own bottle you just have to teach them...
eytlIKITaa	You levels might not be high enough for the test to pick up- wait another week (I know it's hard!!!) and if AF still isn't here take another test..|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	you may have to go to your doctor to have a blood test done. that youa are stessed out. that can do it too. baby dust..|`|XpLufXKFaa	I don't think it was too early to test. There are tests that work up to 5 days before your missed period. But, I think the best thing to do is go see your doctor and ask to get a blood test done. That is the most accurate way to test for pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, your period could just be late because of stress. Clear your mind!|`|zATQaiwIaa	For some reason - some women cannot get a positive on a hpt until weeks after a missed period....as much as it suck to hear - wait a week and try again.  if it is still negative go see your doctor.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	Your hcg levels may be too low to pick up right now on the test.  You could have a blood test done or wait a week and test again.|`|DwTTt628aa	hi its best to wait 5 weeks after the 1st day of your last period usually that will be clear then, i know its horrible waiting but it will be worth it in the end|`|346ce9ba8f89c644a132643a51fc103eaa	It is possible to keep getting a neg and still be pregnant. I got 5 negatives until I got a positive. I would wait a week and test again.<br>  Good luck!
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	your periods will be waaay off right after birth, but if you're really worried, you should call a dr and ask his/her opinion.  i would if i were you, a ten day period is unusual.|`|16vwEBiqaa	First off it is not recommended to engage in intercourse that soon. I would consult your OBGYN. I'm sure it is just slight irregularities in your cycle and nothing to worry about.
OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter is 7 weeks old and snores.  Not extremely loudly but she snores.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Children snore for different reasons than adults.Most children who snore have undiagnosed allergies, often to dairy products.|`|1JbdCRdtaa	Has she had frequent ear infections?  If so I would for sure take her to a pediatric ENT . Most of the time snoring is caused from enlarged adenoids and or tonsils. If she has had many ear infections i guarantee she has enlarged adenoids!  I hope it's nothing but just wanted to give you some advice from someone who was in your place.<br>  <br>  Hayley|`|KDb96QS7aa	I would take her in to get a further evaluation. Snoring is not good and can lead to apnea.  Anything compromising how much oxygen she's getting would raise a red flag for me.
MATiTs5Oaa	A person can be pregnant and still have her periods for 3-4  consecutive months.- less than usual of course. A blood test is best. It is more reliable than urine tests. I'd advise you to have a test as soon as possible.|`|BIDy92Dwaa	omfg! we dont know, we arent doctors. take a pregnancy test and if it comes up posative see your doctor about it, dont troll on yahoo answers. SIGH!|`|Z2xETWhbaa	Yes, you could still have your period while being pregnant.  My sister had hers the first couple of months with her 2nd pregnancy.  The only way to know for sure is to get a pregnancy test.  About the miscarriage I can't say too much about that.  I have never had one but have heard that they are very painful.  Maybe if you are pregnant and lose the baby early it might not hurt so much.  Either way I would either buy a pregnancy test or go into see your doctor to get one.  The Doctor can also do a blood test.  Hope this helps
u7kDLuklaa	I lost my mucus plug at 32 weeks.  Am now 36w5d and baby is still in there.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Could take a month... just depends. Probably not what you wanted to hear, right? ;)
nAvvthR1aa	The chances are slim but still very possible. It only takes one little sperm to get pregnant and there is sperm in precum so it doesn't matter if you ejaculate in her or not.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Slim, but she can still get pregnant since you have precum.  I would think it is fine, but don't do it again just in case.
Ccq8zEcnaa	Wow are you serious. The only way he could have gotten you pregnant was if there was still sperm on his finger. and I doubt if there was one little sperm still on there that it would be able to swim to fertilize your egg.|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	They can live for days but its so unlikely as he cleaned up! Your probably just over reacting.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Sperm DOES NOT die when it hits air.  It does die, however, when it dries.  It was definitely dry after an hour.  You're not pregnant.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	Nope. You can't get pregnant that way. And if you were pregnant, you wouldn't feel sick that early. But you're not pregnant.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	AN HOUR LATER THE SPERM ARE BEYOND DEAD. yes you are. YOUR NOT PREGNANT!!!!|`|K1MbAdsqaa	nope.<br>  <br>  <br>  there isn't any way your pregnant.<br>  <br>  water kills sperm cells.|`|J2glFOkhaa	Go read a book, please|`|rCgZFa0Paa	Sperm can live up to 7 days after being ejaculated, and if your boyfriend did not get all of it off and there was still some there then actually yes you could get pregnant. Not highly likely but possible.|`|Pf5C6mdkaa	Well, you certainly didn't get pregnant that way, but perhaps you are already pregnant from another time you had sex...|`|epsUr7d4aa	naw it dies when it reaches the air lol|`|1twBeaORaa	i know that sex ed is bad these days but really? no i REALLY don't think u can get pregnant that way.
ya7Ngxp0aa	I'm not a doctor, but you really sound pregnant!  : )<br>  <br>  Although blood tests are fairly accurate, for some rare women, the blood test gives a "false negative".  That's when the blood test says you're NOT pregnant, but you most definitely ARE pregnant.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor for a QUANTITATIVE hCG test.  Or you could ask your doc for TWO quantitative hCG pregnancy blood tests split over 3 days.  The results of these tests will give your doctor more information.<br>  <br>  Ask for an ultrasound, too.  Some women who fail the urine and blood tests, show up a baby when they have a sonogram test.  It's rare, but it happens.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, take good care of yourself.  Well done on giving up smoking!  That's great!  Take some pregnancy vitamins as a precaution and if your intuition is telling you something, then best listen to it.  : )<br>  <br>  Let us know how you get on!  I'd love to know!<br>  <br>  x x|`|iMaTMWMxaa	You should have an ultrasound scan, and a blood test to see if anything else is going on.|`|IJ0xybVYaa	ask for a blood test!!!!|`|sstNdyYVaa	for some people it just doesnt show up! rare but true!<br>  <br>  my cousin didnt know she was pregnant until she was 5 months along, she had to go take a blood test to confirm her pregnancy. im guessing its the same with you?<br>  <br>  all the best xxx|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I haven't had a period since November. I have taken multiple test also and was also sick  for a while. If you decide you are pregnant earlier than the test, your body will start having the symptoms mostly because you look for them more. You Also could be going through false pregnancy
LDiBjNf5aa	Since she started the pill on her first day of her period, it is effective immediately.<br>  <br>  And taking it 4.5 hours late once will not affect its effectiveness. You can miss one pill once, take it within 24 hours, and you will still be completely covered. So don't worry. =) I would suggest her finding the best time for her to take it though, so that she can be consistent.<br>  <br>  It's never GUARANTEED that she won't be pregnant, you guys are just protected 99%.|`|1twBeaORaa	look at the instructions on the packet as it depends on which pill she is taking.|`|Cv0bGFiCaa	No form of BC is 100% effective.  The pill pack states to take the pill at the same time everyday because then a steady supply of the medicine is maintained in her system.  For some women, if the supply of medicine drops they can ovulate.  I can tell you that I took my pill around the same time everyday, but not at the same time and I never got pregnant but every woman is different.<br>  <br>  If you know you don't want a kid then you could also try wearing a condom or abstaining.|`|dR2bqUixaa	As long as she takes it every day then you should be ok. But it won't start really working until after 3 months of taking it. So be safe!
UYfqzCoMaa	I did this for awhile when I was a single mother with my first daughter before I met my husband. It was a great experience and I made a lot of great friends and my daughter had kids her age to play with and we still all talk and have a wonderful play group that we have once a week. It is an amazing concept and so helpful.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Thats a brilliant idea so long as all of them have the same views.<br>  I did see a programme on TV that had an example of this on BBC 3,  except about 5 women lived together with their children and i think there was also a single father too.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I think that is a wonderful idea and something that our world really could use right now|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	well that would never suit me   ,,, if i was a solo mum|`|cQb2vqDcaa	I think it's a really good idea, if i were a single mother, i would love to know that i could always depend on someone else if i was in a tight stop. I know i'd never be able to afford a place if it weren't for my partner.  <br>  We've just had a rent a house out of the city because we couldn't afford anywhere in town, so i can understand why they'd want to do this from that point of view.|`|ojVl4Gowaa	If I were a single mom and had a friend who was in the position I would definitely do the same thing. We could both benefit from the babysitting and meal sharing not mention splitting rent and utilities. It would work until one of us was ready to move out!|`|OPrgBGAjaa	i think it is a great idea there was a tv program about this a while ago i think it will give the parents support from other parents and give them some adult company as this is something alot of parents need well that is what i have heard|`|iv7u9iWlaa	I couldn't agree with you more.. it is AMAZING!!!  It is always a joy to see people trying to not only help themselves out but also other people that are in the same situations.|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	I think that is a pretty amazing idea.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	It is great if they could all work together. I'd be very nervous about something like that, it opens the women up to using each other.<br>  <br>  I've heard of women locally who didn't make the news who would go out at all hours dumping their kids on their roommate(s).|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think that is an amazing idea. the only issue i would have is making sure that if something like that was set up that the mothers should have a background check just to make sure that they are on the up and up. you have to be careful of people these days but other then that i think it would be a good idea. especially for those who have a hard time working, taking care of the kids and paying bills. especially today when the economy is so bad, mothers pitching in the help each other would be ideal i think.

If my dad was alive and was a minister I would have him marry me and the man I was going to marry!<br>  <br>  my old paster married his daughter and her husband in his church|`|buoqtZeFaa	That's great congratulations hope it all works out for you!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	7th heaven|`|Od73sfkxaa	Congrats on getting pregnant and getting married!!<br>  <br>  My husband and I were engaged, and had a wedding planned for December of 07...well it was going to be delayed because of random things so we went ahead in November of 07 and got married at a courthouse. It was so cute because we were both off that day and we were like, "Should we get married today?" and we did!! (we always worked opposite times of the day) A year later November of 08 we had a wedding ceremony...me in a dress, everyone so beautiful and handsome!! It was nice to say our vows in front of a preacher. I love both of our weddings. One was spontaneous, and no one knew we were going to do it...and then the other one was like the wedding I always wanted!<br>  <br>  My sister is engaged, and she is going to be married by her fiance's grandmother lol. It's cute!! So I don't think there is anything wrong with your dad marrying you. It will mean more to you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats!!
zSpAZF9Oaa	I once took the frozen, peeled apples from the freezer to make an apple crisp. Gave them a good sprinkle of cinnamon and topped them with the oatmeal/flour/brown sugar and butter topping.  Popped the apple crisp in the oven and within moments, we could smell the sweet aroma of cinnamon.  When the oven timer went off, we were all waiting and ready to plunk a good scoop of vanilla icecream on our piping hot apple crisp.  My son was the first to say that it didn't taste the same as usual, my husband agreed, but they continued to eat it.  I sat down and took a bite and quickly spat it out - TERRIBLE.  I had used frozen turnip,lol... I've never looked at a turnip the same.  Sneaky buggers!<br>  <br>  I now have a drawer full of Sharpies and nothing goes into that freezer unmarked.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Oh yes, I've done that.  When my son was a baby, I made all of his baby food at home.  He had it made with his organic, homemade, fresh baby food - until the day that I accidentally mixed blueberry puree with squash, thinking it was bananas.  Sleep - deprived Mommy forgot to check the labels on the containers in the freezer.  On the upside, he made the cutest and funniest face I've ever seen when he tasted it.|`|AA11920812	Yes, I have done that. Usually, I can the leftovers and sharpie the tin lid part. But, when bulk canning this last time I just designated a shelf to each thing. That was great until I had to make room for other stuff as the cans started dwindling. And...I defrosted applesauce only to find it was chicken stock, lol. Ah, no worries. We just had the chicken stock in chicken noodle soup the next night!<br>  <br>  Perhaps, you made tomorrows lunch w/o knowing it.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	lol no ive never done that. We use masking tape and a marker for everything or else you can get decorated tin foil pans and we use different colors for different foods. I know my system, my husband not so much.|`|o7LZbknAaa	They have those ziploc bags with a place to write on them.  Actually, just get a permanent marker and write on them.|`|lBw50ySpaa	Masking tape sticks to plastic bowls and comes off easily.  Write on it with a permanent marker.  No guessing.|`|pA6Ntl2Eaa	I just label it accordingly|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	masking tape and a sharpie|`|98tnx1Uhaa	duct tape and a marker works great|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My husband once used frozen chopped watermelon in chili, thinking it was frozen chopped tomatoes.  He had also used some canned tomatoes, so it still had a nice tomato base.  <br>  <br>  The finished chili was kind of nice, actually.  Although, we haven't tried it again.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Yes, I've done that. Tape and sharpies for us both!|`|4gZYucHMaa	I had venison in my freezer (given to me by some kids who live next door) and I kept avoiding it like the plague.<br>  <br>  One night I wanted to make beef barley soup and thought it was the left over roast beef but nope it was *that stuff*---I didn't tell the kids what we were eating but I couldn't eat it and they wondered why. My daughter is such an animal lover (i think she'd be a vegetarian if she were older) and when I finally told her it was deer meat, she freaked but my son could care less -he'll eat anything<br>  <br>  I just really hate the tast of gamey meat!|`|j2mRop0laa	You know how I have a really hard time cooking meat, since I don't eat it?<br>  Well, the only meat items in our fridge in the past 8 years have been: chicken, precut hamburger patties, fish and shrimp.<br>  <br>  It's kinda hard to confuse those! lol|`|G2auAv1Saa	I've doused a salad in tarter sauce and my daughter loved it, I thought it was disgusting!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Every nights a surprise.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I have never done that. and I don't even do the sharpie and tape thing. I use the food storage bags that are more clear I don't use the zip lock bags because you can't see through them very well. but when it comes to things like sauces if I have to put them in a freezer I put them in the bags and tie them with those little twist tie things that are different colors. I also keep all my meat in the deep freezer and things like ice cream and sauces in the regular freezer.|`|oP504BtFaa	I laughed out loud at the first answer. I've done that a few times, but I'm such a neat freak that I label EVERYTHING. Masking tape and a permanent marker work wonders. Or a label-maker, if you're as anal about organization as I am :)|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes i have, it's always quite agrivating when that happens too. I started writing on the aluminum foil my own system of initials that tells me what things are, or else on any container, or zip lock bag, etc.<br>  <br>  lol, i'll sharpie anything!|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	I used to write with Sharpie, and then have to throw the containers away or have a bunch of crossed out things! Then I thought of the duct tape thing. Guess I wasn't too bright back then LOL.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	sticky notes or other adhesive labels.<br>  <br>  My mom keeps the regular things we have frozen in boxes in the freezer, like spaghetti, soups, etc.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Nope haven't done that. I usually write what it is on the bag with a sharpie. (My sister and dad don't know what's what around here)<br>  <br>  Please pass the pork!!|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I pulled out "ham" and it turned out to be freezer-burnt deer salami... Gross! Haha. I had to think quickly to figure out something else.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	I Would have Tossed it in lol  <br>  That's the Way New Recipes are Discovered <br>  <br>  BBQ Porkghetti?  Id Try it
sK8ZhTahaa	I left mine in their rooms or playpen, you can't be with them all the time.<br>  You don't carry them all around the house with you when you go to different rooms and you are not in their rooms all night when they are sleeping are you?<br>  Well some people do but I would never do it.|`|UR9BX77haa	From day one my daughter has come with me everywhere, we had a bouncer in the bathroom for when I needed the toilet or to shower and she would be on my hip whilst I hung out washing, its more difficult but its ruddy good exercise plus I couldn't bare leaving her unnatended for one minute. She 2yrs 4 months now and I am more relaxed in that I will run upstiars to use the toilet and leave her playing in the living room but I do rush so I'm no longer than about 40 seconds. <br>  I have never let it stop me doing anything though, I just do it all with her in tow.|`|AA11481889	My two year old helps me transfer the wet clothes from the washer to the dryer.<br>  <br>  If I did have to hang laundry out to dry...he'd help me with that too.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about an infant...a playpen or baby seat can be brought out and set up beside you while you do your chores.<br>  <br>  <br>  ************************<br>  LOL ...be sure not to take parenting advice from people who can't even focus long enough to read the damn question.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	answerers should read all the question, washing.|`|RSczEcZCaa	Usually they just play inside, they just check on me if i'm done yet. it's just 10 steps away btw.|`|AA11991351	I take them out with me as i have a door in my kitchen leading out to my backgarden.|`|dCOLRrK3aa	jesus, talk about insecure!|`|zDYphWwvaa	take them with you|`|cQb2vqDcaa	He'll come out into the garden with me and play... But that's more because he won't leave me alonoe for 5 seconds.  haha|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I have a washer and dryer, I don't hang clothes outside.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Well, I have a washer and dryer and don't need to use a clothesline. My son has a playroom designed for him so I will either put the gate up and step out for a minute to use the bathroom or to mop a floor and I know he is safe and can hear him without him being in the way of something that could hurt him.<br>  <br>  If I had to go outside for any reason then my son comes with me and he plays in the yard while I do what I need to.  I can do it safely because we have a large backyard that is flat and fenced all around with chain locked gates he can't open.  He will usually ride his tricycle or play in the sand box when I am out there.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I dont know... I have a dryer so I dont hang the clothes out besides in the Canadian winter I think I'd freeze if I did that LOL<br>  <br>  But I do take a shower when my kids are around... I just have a shower in our basement bathroom-. Our basement is childproofed.. and their play area.. and if needed be a movie would do the trick :)|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	We have a play room. And when we want to hang out we have other parents over. They bring their kids and they watch movies, play video games, etc. While we do our thing.|`|AA10077992	If it's nice enough to hang out the washing- it's nice enough for the children to be outside too|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	mine are older now but as babies i used to put them in the playpen or buggy for   the time  i would be out , not ideal but safer than the alternative esp with your two must be hard   for you
GODp5htoaa	You should go scribble it out first and then do a fingerprint and DNA test on all the walls!!! Check the floors for footprints and then go look at everyones shoes in lessons! Climb under the tables and take swabs off peoples shoes WHO CARES IF THEY THINK YOUR WEIRD you want to find out what poo face wrote this. By the way - What did they write ???|`|WnbutJsuaa	Hey don't worry about it! i'm 16 and can tell that if there's something teens like to do is gossip and say crap about each other, u should feel sorry for the person who did it because she's probably jealous or feels threatened by u! really be superior, u know who your real friends are, so no one else matters! e-mail me if u wanna talk!|`|BKxAt8mNaa	That is BULLYING! And in this country, bullying is completely unacceptable. Yet, that wont stop others from doing it. I am very sorry...I was bullyed for years at secondary school. It is a horrible experience. <br>  <br>  If you DO find out who it was, write a load of crap about them. I know it's petty but hey... lol|`|6nElnyzEaa	Why do they write it in the bathrooms? If they have a problem with you, why don't they tell you. Finding out isn't good because most kids think they're cool and the may have done it but they'll deny it.|`|rHPQLDc6aa	test the marking atoms for an exact mach on a pen/pencil <br>  then track down the owner of the pen/pencil<br>  <br>  if its been left on the floor ferensicly test it|`|jqXV8y3Laa	tell your principle|`|tjAYcyviaa	can you think of anyone who might have done it?<br>  <br>  just ask around, someone must know or have seen it|`|8uy5SZCfaa	i dont know how you could find it out but just ask your friends for support and tell a teacher.xoxo|`|Inc78M0Raa	Write under it "If you were brave then you would tell me this to my face. Not on a bathrom wall. Coward." Otherwise, try to figure out who has handwriting like it.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	It doesnt matter who it was.  hold your head high and be proud of who you are.  in order for someone to do something like that, they have to be pretty shallow and insecure.  They have a lot of crap going on in their own personal lives therefore they have to make someone else feel bad.  Whenever you see stuff written about you, just scribble it out and go on with your day.  Rumors are no fun if the person they are being spread about doesnt react.  it will end up stopping and the mean girl will either grow up and be mature or find some other victim.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Well who's handwriting does it look like?<br>  Report it to your head of year, headteacher/principal or teacher to get it removed.<br>  <br>  It is very harsh for someone to write about you, espically if you'll find out, which they want you too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Who cares what they write? As long as you've got your friends, it shouldn't matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  Report it!|`|TFXQHXSAaa	It could have been a hand full of people you know, u may never find out who it was.  here's my theory WHO CARES!! whoever did this may be jealous of you, or they feel so bad about them self that they have to pick on other people to make them feel bigger.  if you have friends, and they love and care about you, you don't need to worry. a similar situation happened to me where people were spreading rumors. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT! if you've got people who know it isn't true you are in a good spot.|`|lTsPX04jaa	you cant
wKuQC4yTaa	No, its not something to lye about. there gonna find out one way or another in 9 months....lmao|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Dangerous water huni stay well out of it... Can only end in disaster...|`|1tkFGhU6aa	NO! dont do this, u'll fell bad when they find the truth about u! be careful|`|mgiJVjaKaa	No, that's playing with someone else's emotions. If you think you might be pregnant, say that. But to try and put that you know you *are* why? To see how they react? to see if they "really love you" and return? <br>  <br>  To me, that is a girl who can't maturely deal with something.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	No.  That would be dumb, wouldn't it?  There is a difference between telling a guy you MIGHT be pregnant and need to take a test, vs telling him you ARE when you know damn well you're not, or haven't even taken a test yet to confirm it.|`|ztzEloj5aa	no but i have told someone i was late and could be....|`|KGRikkJeaa	i told him i thought i was...he got happy, but it turned out that i wasnt|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	Umm, no. I have told my husband, "I may be pregnant but I am not sure."|`|NNwEuC8paa	I've made the mistake of saying " I think I might be pregnant" after that time, any other time i just kept my mouth shut lol. Take the test first! Good luck!|`|bTlhBX3daa	No. I think that would be a mean thing to do and I have always felt that baby's are a serious matter.|`|0upnZ6hSaa	NO!  Why would u do that?  If u need to make up stuff like that to make him be that into u---maybe u should move on and find someone else.|`|HMPdnhApaa	No. Why in the world would you do that??|`|F9pAWBG9aa	no but i know lots of girls that have....

TTgLTMpDaa	First, let me just say that some people in life really do just need the **** beaten out of them.<br>  <br>  However, other things you can try include;<br>  -reporting their actions to a higher power - their guidance teacher, or headmaster, or parent.<br>  -use a different form of transport (i.e avoid them)<br>  -learn psychology to the degree where you can pick apart their insecurities and have them crying in minutes (i.e beat the **** out of them with your mind, not your body)<br>  -ignore them.|`|0kIwehVbaa	Walk or get a ride to school.|`|6EzvfrCzaa	See if you can get a seat to the front of the bus or near the driver|`|9xHO2HkHaa	First of all, fighting them is not gonna solve anything...I know you think it will probably prove a point but its just going to get you in trouble and its not even worth it.  I know you said you can't ignore them but that is the only way to stop them.  I graduated HS in 2007 and did stupid things like that but when I look back fighting and name calling that kinda stuff is so stupid and lame.  Just tell them you don't care what they say and to grow up and get a life and its just going to make them look more foolish.
4Bgw5xs8aa	After my baby got her shots she did the same thing. I called her doc and they said it wasn't a side effect of the shots...but I'm not sure I agree with this one. Anyway, teething can also cause diarrhea. You can tell if she's getting dehydrated if she's having less than about 6 wet diapers in a  24 hour period. ALSO her doc told me that they don't normally see a baby for diarrhea until 3 days of it...but your doc may be different. Call and ask their nurse hotline. (after hours hotline). Just keep giving formula if baby will take it, if not try some pedialyte. Keep the baby hydrated, call the nurse, and keep a watch on her diapers and all should be fine.|`|KDb96QS7aa	It's normal for babies to be a little cranky a day or two after their shots. <br>  Diarrhea on the other hand is very abstract...they could be sick, could be they're just stressed out. You can tell if he's dehydrated by keeping an eye on his wet diapers (at least 6) and on his fontanels...making sure the soft spots in his head are not sunken in.  If he's making too few wet diapers or his fontanels look sunken then he is dehydrated and you should give him some pedialyte and call the doctor.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	you should really get diarrhea checked in a baby after 24 hours. he will have less wet nappies if hes dehdrated, his fonatelle will be sunken and his mouth may be dry. def get him checked anyway
29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	OMG! How desperate or dumb do you have to be NOT to call the authorities when someone offers to trade you their children for an overpriced bird.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	I read the article when you first posted it and I just stared at the screen speechless.  <br>  <br>  Three hours later I'm hoping the Romeros were trying to do a good thing by taking the children from someone who clearly thought they were less valuable than a bird.  Because if they really thought it was legal or ethical to swap a pet for children, they deserve a living Darwin Award.<br>  <br>  Bond for stupidity: priceless.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	What's next, buying people's children with food vouchers?  Maybe a baby for a turkey?<br>  <br>  As for the $5000 bond, that seems logical.  It is not their punishment, just their bond.  Maybe they will skip bail and have Dog the Bounty Hunter go after them and give more media attention to this issue of baby trafficking!|`|RKcwfrGOaa	"The Romeros had good intentions from what we see," said Keith Dupre, a detective with the Evangeline Parish Sheriff's Office.<br>  <br>  Trading a bird for two small humans is intent to abduct two children, and child abduction is not a good intention.  Yes, $5,000 is just a little low.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	dang! Some Birds live 99 years and the owners have to change the paper on the bottom of the cage--Why on earth would anyone want a bird more then a baby?<br>  <br>  Unbelievable actually---well, actually maybe not... I find it not only Low but, sick!  Goes to show there is garbage that walks in all kinds of packages...<br>  <br>  Thanks for sharing yet another story about the points some people will stoop.|`|5iW2Wljfaa	i think they all was wrong for this and hard time should be done and i feel really bad for the children|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Randy,<br>  <br>  I can't help but wonder how people like this even get their hands on these kids. The article says the woman who was doing the "placing" was a trucker and not the kids' biological mother. The whole situation is creepy and sadly, it is the second weird illegal adoption story I've seen this week. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gmtoday.com/news/local_stories/2009/Feb_09/02202009_07.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gmtoday.com/news/local_storie...</a><br>  <br>  What is WRONG with people?! Poor kids...|`|3X4i5Whvaa	Hmmmm...the article says the father was from Leesville...which is a military town...I have been there.<br>  <br>  Wonder if there is a connection..some soldiers have lost custody of their children...<br>  <br>  and the mother is somewhere "in Texas"...|`|XyU6oEVPaa	Randy, <br>  <br>  It seems that what would be a felony in any other area becomes minimized when adoption enters the picture.  Then all bets are off.  This is just another example of excusing people who are 'desperate to have a child', any child, at any cost, or at anyone's expense.  There was a man in the news a few years ago who was abducted by a couple when he was a child, he was then in his 30's, I believe, and the people who abducted him were found out.  He was on television begging the courts to show leniency since they were 'the only family he ever knew...his only parents'...all except his natural mother who had spent her entire adult life grieving the loss of her son. They got a light sentence, something like 6 years, I am thinking.  The criminals were referred to as his 'adoptive parents' even though there was NEVER an adoption!  I find that so offensive! <br>  <br>  Why don't the Lindbergh Laws apply when it comes to adoption?  Child abduction is child abduction....even when it is disguised as adoption.  The Lindbergh Laws made it a capital offense to abduct a child.  <br>  <br>  It seems that adoption is so much about women preying on other women.  It is clearly sexual discrimination, since the victims are women and children.  If it were a man's property that was at stake, the law would prosecute to the fullest, but since it is just a woman and her child, and the perps were 'desperate for a child' they will get their hand slapped, and sent on their way.  And, the 'birthmother' can just suck it up and get on with things...she was probably a single mother, anyway, and so what if her life was ruined!|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Some people don't think do they...<br>  <br>  (Yes it was low.)<br>  <br>  And I doubt there was a brain between any of them when it came to the welfare of these kids. How did that woman get a hold of them in the first place? You woulda thought some alarm bells might have gone off in the Romero's  brains when she offered them the kids for the bird... Now that is one couple a sandwich short of a picnic.<br>  <br>  And who has custody of the bird now? The poor thing was thrown into the middle of it.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Yeah- these folks are as low as people who pay $30,000.00 for "adoption fees" for a domestic or foreign newborn adoption or people who coerce young women into surrendering their babies. geesh.|`|YkSPMvg5aa	Ugh....I think this really is awful.  The kids will carry this with them for the rest of their lives.
kv8ZFPP1aa	the leaky breast is normal it's getting ready to produce milk for your baby and the pain with the belly button is normal because your uterous is stretching. and it depends on how big you were before you got pregnant as when your belly will get hard. but you can bring all of these up to your dr if you're really that worried.|`|mldo1vxYaa	So sorry to hear the loss of your twins, but to answer your question yes it is all normal, you will have plenty of aches and pains, all par for the course but so worth it in the end, good luck I am sure you will be fine.x|`|AA11542929	yeah its normal.. dont worry.. ur ok.. congrats mama|`|QP1ZQqPfaa	well my friend was pregnant with twins and lost one and was able to save the other. She would always complain of pain in her belly Button so maybe it is normal. the fluid from your breast is milk well the begging stages of milk.  and sometimes your belly can be soft until your last few months congrats.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	yes
AA11490722	I really like the name Nathan. Very very nice choice. My hubby and I are too considering the name Nathan for our baby if it is a boy. <br>  <br>  I like Nathan George better. Riley is a nice name too but it is becoming a rather common name- (more so as a first name though so it could work very nicely as a second name).<br>  <br>  Nathan George has a nice ring to it. It's a good strong sounding name.<br>  <br>  Hubby and I are considering Nathan Eric or Nathan Thomas as names for our baby (Eric is hubby's grandfather's name and Thomas is my fathers name)|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Nathan Riley: 10/10 I love this name, it is elegant but has spunk!!!! I think that I like an older name paired with a newer trendy name the best. I think that it gives a old name a new look and sound. I really don't and can't care for the name George, I think it is because I am biased, there was a kid in my school growing up that refused to take a shower and was always talking really loud and thought he was the coolest kid in school and you couldn't even walk by him, he smelled that bad. So that is what I see when I think of George. I really like Nathan Riley though.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I prefer Nathan Riley<br>  I'll rate each for you, as well.<br>  <br>  Nathan George - I don't care for George. It might be because of George Bush, but I'm not sure. There's just something about that is unappealing to me. With such a cool, hip name such as Nathan, George really puts a damper on it. Lol sorry if that sounds harsh, that's just how I honestly feel about it.<br>  <br>  Nathan Riley - This is great. The names complement each other perfectly, and they are both hip, modern names. I also really like having two names that have the long vowel sound. cuz NA-than RI-ley. I like how they sound together.<br>  My favorite name is Nathan Tyler. Another one to consider! Lol<br>  <br>  Nathan Riley wins by far. Go with it and don't look back|`|GvamTVqAaa	Nathan Riley..<br>  <br>  Love the name Riley, don't like the name George..|`|EXBMxFCKaa	Nathan Riley: The fluidity is better and the name seems to have a more mellow and modern vibe, Nathan is an adorable name that's not as old-fashioned sounding as Nathaniel, something like Riley, which isn't as old-fashioned as George, compliments it well. 9/10<br>  <br>  Nathan George: I've never personally liked the name George and I think it sounds harsh with Nathan, which has a kind of free-spirited and neutral connotation, George just ends harshly to me for some reason, it doesn't have great fluidity of theme contrast, overall I just don't feel it's complimenting. 3/10<br>  <br>  I prefer Nathan Riley for sure :)|`|u94HOVz7aa	as i say the names out loud i like the how NATHAN RILEY sounds better.  but then again i have an issue with the name george.  Its the name i give all male animals/dolls/imaginary people at first. its the first male name that comes to mind when i am thinking names. i actually have had 2 hampsters named George (both got eaten by my cats) Dont get me wrong i LOVE the name George, but i can't imagine naming any of my children that. <br>  <br>  this is just my opinion.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	<a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452</a><br>  <br>  Welll I like the name Riley better than Nathan so I guess I like George Riley better.|`|zXcaTKqRaa	Nathan George. Riley is very trendy right now. I think Nathan George sounds very classy.|`|tkQq5tR1aa	Nathan Riley. I hate George. Especially George Bush.|`|KeRqdX2Vaa	I like Nathan George. I am really indifferent about the name Riley. Nathaniel George works too, with Nathan or Nate as a nickname? :)|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I like them both! I would go with Nathan George. Too many kids have the name Riley.|`|a61UT6hdaa	nathan riley :)<br>  <br>  riley sounds good for a middle name|`|7SX7j2jvaa	Nathan Riley.....<br>  <br>  I like that name beacause is not really a pretty name i would pick Nathan Riley|`|3x1tJRmOaa	I like George Riley.|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	i just think nathan riley flows better.|`|lAdXK3R1aa	Nathan Riley!!! <br>  I like that so much better...they're a really nice name.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Nathan Riley. I love the first name and Riley is a name I like also. I can't stand the name George.|`|gRnARw6Oaa	I like Nathan Riley the best. It has the most natural flow of the 2 choices, and I'm also not really fond of George.

MHOxPs8Oaa	I think 50 to 75 dollars a day would be fair. With 50 dollars she would make about 7 dollars an hour which is around minimum wage depending on the state it could be below or above minimum wage, but 75 is about 10 dollars an hour, so somewhere around 50 to 75 dollars I would say is about right.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Just ask her how much she wants to be paid and negotiate from there.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion is a babysitter in your house should make at least minimum wage. If you want a sitter who will accept less you should look for a stay at home mom who can watch your kid plus one-two others in their home.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	I pay $28/day for my 5 month old daughter at a daycare center and she is there from 830am-530pm M-F. They charge $4/hour and anything over 4 hours is a full day at $28. My 6 year old son has a slightly cheaper rate, and he is only there for about an hour a day after school.<br>  <br>  Considering she is traveling (you didn't say how far) and taking care of your child only, I would say at least $40-$50/day. That should of course cover the gas and the care. <br>  <br>  I guess depending on where you live child care expenses vary. I live in a rural area outside Pittsburgh, PA and that seems to be the average amount around here.

8Qxb7OZOaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I think the doctors that were playing mad science should be held financially responsible for their irresponsible decision and action.<br>  <br>  She wouldn't have been able to have any kids at all if it were not for the doctors unethical decisions.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Mikey,<br>  <br>  I can't understand why everyone wants to punish the children for their mother's selfishness. What in the world did they do to deserve their names, siblings, mother, history, rights, etc. stripped from them? Why should they have to suffer a lifetime of questions and wondering and lack of information when they never asked to be put in this position?<br>  <br>  I think their mother is a selfish, spoiled, attention-seeking, narcissistic, fanatical, delusional scam artist and I have SERIOUS doubts about her parenting skills, BUT I do not think that her children should have to bear the burden of the issues and pain adoption can bring on top of their current situation. Some other solution needs to be thought of. I have no doubt that DCYF will end up being involved on some level. <br>  <br>  I wish I could say that i had the answer for this but I don't. Nadya needs to be held accountable for her actions but her children are innocent. They deserve to have their rights protected - not trampled on.  *sigh* <br>  <br>  Poor kids.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I wouldn't be in her predicament.  I would NEVER place my wants above my child's needs and I damn sure wouldn't pay that kind of money to get pregnant and then NOT pay my mortgage!  She should not have custody of any child.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Well first I'd never be in her situation lol. But I do think she should give those kids up because there is no way they will get everything they need and deserve.|`|BTuFtui3aa	No, she wants to raise them, so it wouldn't make sense for her to place them for adoption. I also feel strongly that it's wrong to separate siblings, as well as the fact their mother has parental rights.<br>  <br>  I don't think the state should take the children away unless she proves to be abusive or neglectful. While she doesn't seem to be the most attentive parent ever, I don't think her previous children were being mistreated per se, and she should at least have the chance to raise her own babies.<br>  <br>  However, there are things about her lifestyle that concern me. She has serious financial trouble, and has relied so heavily on her "support" system that they're pulling back and deciding to stop enabling her. She already had six young children, at least one of whom has serious special needs, and according to CNN was already receiving $490 per month in food stamps. I think having eight more babies was unwise, and she really needs counseling. A LOT of counseling. CPS should monitor the case, and prescribe corrective measures if needed, but shouldn't just jump straight to removal.<br>  <br>  I don't think the state should remove children based on what MIGHT happen unless there's STRONG evidence of likely future harm. In this case, while I doubt this woman is the ideal mom, I have no reason to think she will abuse or neglect her kids. While this case is high profile, she shouldn't be treated differently from anyone else... which means she should be given a chance.<br>  <br>  Suleman has serious problems, but adoption won't solve them. She needs to work on getting support and counseling. This situation is what it is, and separating the babies from their mom and/or each other isn't going to improve it.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	From an interview I watch of her she looks determined to raise them herself. The only time a child should be taken from a parent is because of abuse or negligence.(Or if they actually decide to relinquish a child themselves for adoption.) They are alive and here now, she's their mother its her choice if she raises all of them or not. She's the one who knows if she can cope or not. I just hope she has some giving decent friends who offer to help out. Its what real friends do.<br>  <br>  Why don't people want to give her a hand instead, what happened to having some compassion. I pay taxes and I don't mind some of it going to genuine people who need the support. (Not all people are genuine, but they get found out in the end.) But then l live in a community.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	If I were her, I would get a Y!A account and tell people to stop asking this question.  <br>   <br>  They are HER babies. Im sure there are pap's camped outside of that hospital with their home study and credit reports. She will have all kinds of money from photo ops & endorsements.|`|frpCK0utaa	no. last timei checked, she was their mother, and until CPS declares her unfit or she starts beating or neglecting them, they are her kids.|`|EKfyEfC9aa	Okay hasn't this question been asked enough?  Sorry not trying to be rude, but I'm ready for some new questions!!!|`|RrgQUT5vaa	This is getting ridiculous.  Why ever should she give up her children?|`|6orvPrLLaa	it's called "search for questions."|`|jrCZ6fadaa	Yes, lets make these poor kids pay for what their MOTHER did.......<br>  <br>  How about instead if REMOVING HER, we INSERT help.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	No, she shouldn't give any of them up for adoption. Why does everyone keep suggesting this?  Why would anyone want to break up a family with 14 kids?  And if someone was willing to take in all 14, it's still a family of 14 kids!!  At the very least, you'd want to keep the octuplets together, and that is still 8 kids with special needs, a lot by most standards.<br>  <br>  If CA finds that she is an unfit parent, then let the state deal with it.  She's got a few loose screws, but I do think she does love her children.  There has been nothing to suggest that her children are being abused or neglected. I don't think providing for them will be a problem, I'm sure the money and donations are pouring in.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be in her situation because my clinic will only allow me to implant 2 or 3 embryos.  And if I did have a whack job doc who wanted to do 8... I'd go to another practice.|`|ioNKVW9haa	I am SO SICK of hearing about this wench.<br>  <br>  Why do people INSIST on giving her so much attention?!  She loves the attention.  Maybe if the networks stop forking over the cash for craptacular interviews and poor, gullible saps stop sending in their donations to further enable this woman, she'll finally GO away.<br>  <br>  As for the octuplets, well... the most we can do is hope that they'll have the chance to grow and get strong enough to get past their selfish, rotten 'mother' (though I use that term loosely) ... and do good by themselves since she obviously was too concerned with feeling 'lonely' to do good by her kids herself.<br>  <br>  You know who I REALLY feel sorry for?  The six OTHER kids.  The six children who weren't GOOD enough for her, so she had to go and have 8 more.<br>  <br>  ETA:  After I was done raging, I realized that I didn't answer your question, OP!  Despite my obvious loathing of Nadia Suleman, I do not believe that removing her children is the answer.<br>  <br>  14 siblings separated?  That's only damaging.  Punishing the children because their mother's an airhead seems mighty unfair to me.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	I would.I understand that it is a very difficult choice but it is the best interest of the children.How can she possibly care for 14 children,on her own,with no job?????2 of her older children are autistic there is no way that they are getting the care and attention that they need.The grandmas house is going to be for foreclosed on she is 23,000 behind in mortgage payments.I mean I feel bad for the babies bc their mom is off her rocker.|`|ZiC2hGm4aa	I wouldn't have got in that situation in the first place..she already has 6 kids which she has dumped on her mother..how selfish is that..why did she need more kids when she obviously can't look after the ones she has got..Sorry but I think they should be adopted..what sort of liife are they going to have..There are couples out there in stable, loving relationships who would give anything just to have one child..Beats me how this women has been allowed to get away with it..|`|OQnRP6xVaa	AGAIN!<br>  <br>  She got herself into the "situation" because she wanted to.<br>  The Doctor who allowed this should pay child support...<br>  <br>  and One More Time---When she is Proved Unfit to parent by a Judge we can all put dibs in on her baby's Till then I say--lots of parents don't do it my way and it gives me no right to take away their children...|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	There is a woman in one of my online groups who has 13 children: eight of whom she adopted.  Should she give up some of her adopted or natural children as well?  <br>  <br>  Or is a woman "noble" for adopting children yet "undeserving" if she has given birth to them? <br>  <br>  Quit flogging this dead horse.|`|15e94cdd62390c77d894baf7872415d3aa	No leave her alone. If she wanted to get rid of some of the children she would have aborted some of them.  To many people worry to much on other peoples business.  There are a lot of children in family settings that needs to be removed and they are still there.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I may not agree with her having so many children but feel she should raise them. If she abused or neglected them that would be a different matter But where's the prove she's a bad mother.  It's about time she got some privacy.|`|AXEqOEloaa	I think it is time to stop beating this dead horse already.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Well I personally think she's mentally unstable. I think she should give them up because there's no way she can care for each one of them and her other six kids. Even if she could provide food and beds, she couldn't provide the love and attention a child needs. All of her children are going to have to do the same activities and have the same friends - she can't drive 14 kids to all different things.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Personally, I'm content to leave this story go and just let the woman get on with her life.  I'm about as sick of tabloid journalism as I am with reality shows.  The authorities in her area which make any decision they deem necessary and the system will play out as it does.  She will either keep them, be allowed to keep them or the State will step in.  I couldn't be bothered to "arm chair quarterback" this one any more.
VEkkn2Otaa	I got induced with my daughter. They put pills in at 6 am made me walk for 30 min every hour!!!!!! Tell 11 am, broke my water, uped the petocin, then i finally started to progress at 9:00 pm got my epidural at 6cm wasent in pain just wanted to enjoy the birth! Got to an 10cm at 3:15am delivered in three pushes at 3:32am!!|`|98WKYtfwaa	That's basically all that happens. They'll do the membrane sweep, or put pills inside you, i don't know what they're doing but after that they'll get you to walk around for a bit. <br>  <br>  They'll give you the drip of pitocin which can take a while to start off contractions, but it works. <br>  <br>  Then bam, you're in labour and your having your baby. There is always the chance that the picotin doesn't work completely and your cervix still doesn't dialate, if that's the case you'd get a c-section but that's quite rare i believe.|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	When I had an induction with my son, I didn't realize how long it would actually take. I was there for over 10 hours before I started even feeling contractions because I had not dilated or anything ahead of time either. So, I recommend bring books, movies, your laptop- anything to keep you occupied. Time seems to go by very slowly when you are waiting for something to happen. They inserted pills vaginally for me every 4 hours or so. I think they were on the 3rd when I started feeling contractions very lightly. I never had the drip, though. Also, bringing coins for other ppl who are camping out with you- family and husband, friends- is always a great idea because they get hungry waiting around. :) <br>  What I didn't know was the increased risk in a c-section. After 23 hrs of labor I had a c-section, but I'm not complaining. I just wanted to se my little one so badly by that point I didn't care what they did. You will be just fine! Congrats!|`|4t5eGShiaa	LOL.. just about! I was scheduled to be induced a week after my son was born, but my water had broke a week earlier. I wasn't dilating fast enough so they put me on Pitocin to help move the labor along and about 24 hours later... my son was born!|`|QWfkHyUeaa	yes it is very true... when the drip is inserted, it takes about an hour for contraction to begin really stronge, the general time it takes when induced is 6 hours, with my first baby induced 5weeks premy, it took 11 hours only because i chose to have epidural, it slows the process down...<br>  my second baby induced one month early and took 4 hours with no drugs at all. it went very fast...<br>  stay positive i imagine it will go pretty fast considering your over due and thinning all ready... tthey break your waters at the start also and allot off woman will go into laybour naturally.. being induced yes if on sat moring you'll have a baby on saturday.....|`|hjLzSGV0aa	oh girl<br>  i dont even know<br>  my doctor wanted to induce me but my son came by himself excatly 365 days ago<br>  yup today is his b-day :]]]]\<br>  but i never heard about that wat your doc said<br>  my doc said she'll put something in the iv<br>  but i was already dialted so maybe its b/c you aint it yet|`|gGchCKC4aa	I had the drip induction.... all I can say is if possible, move around to WHATEVER position makes you most comfy.  When induced you have harsher contractions, more back labor, so they come hard and fast.  Good luck to you!|`|JreuGwJYaa	I was induced a different way so I couldnt tell you I just had an IV with a inducing medicine in it. But it did work.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I suggest that you don't get induced.  The due date is a rough estimate of when the baby could be born.  If you haven't gone into labor naturally the baby isn't ready yet.  Doctors are very anxious to have everything on a time table they can predict, but baby's lungs are still developing.  When they are done they send out a hormone that sends you into labor.  It is also the same hormone that brings in your milk and allows baby to bond.  If you are induced it speeds up contractions and makes them very hard and painful.  It deprives the baby of much needed oxygen and blood which is one reason that so many women who go to be induced end up with a c section, because the baby's vitals drop.  Induction is also very hard for you and you usually end up with painkillers, all of which are narcotics and a sister to Heroine, and yes, baby gets it all.  Most baby's come out kind of drugged and not wanting to nurse or really bond.<br>  I suggest you cancel the induction and just let your body go into labor naturally.  It's better for you both.  When you are feeling contractions about 3 minutes apart then go to the hospital.  I've had 2 inductions (one that led to a C section) and 1 natural birth (2 this May) and I noticed a definite difference with everything|`|1S5AbPueaa	I was induced too, but I had my water poped.I was first on pitocin,but it was not making me contract so the Dr. poped my water.That was around 8 I had my son around 3.
X9JSlC6Iaa	Is this your dance teacher? You REALLY need to find someone your own age. You have a CRUSH on him. He is what 24? You are what 16? Find someone your own age.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Yeah, sorry.  He is just not that into you!|`|UinOWcMUaa	yep -- but it's ok your still cute !|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yes...you were rejected as a potential date, but not as a friend.  Good for you for taking the initiative though!  That takes guts.  Now you can let him go and move on to your next heart throb.  its a good thing, trust me.  this is that part of life that we all must experience at some point.  GOOD LUCK!|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Actually he doesnt really like you on that level..So yeah it sounds like you got rejected.. He sounds like he just wants to be friends...But hey just be his friend and see if the relationship develops into something more..Maybe he just needs to spend time with you..if his feelings dont grow, dont worry cuz it probably wasnt meant to be...|`|R0YkIVlpaa	it sounds like you did..... sorry ;(|`|dWcgsOgIaa	Yes, you got rejected as a partner; but not as a friend. If you're still interested in being his friend, perhaps you could pursue that type of relationship with him. Who knows, perhaps something more will grow between you. <br>  <br>  Just don't 'overwork' it. If he's not putting forth the same amount of energy towards being your friend as you are towards him, cut your loses and move on. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|Lxd7jaASaa	I think you just put that un him unexpectedly..like he wasnt expecting a girl to just call him and say that out of the blue! i bet he liked you confidence and up-front personality though..good job. i deffinetly dont think he rejected you..he probably felt intimidated or awkward and couldnt think of what to say. He obviously wanted to see you at this treehouse thing. if he doesnt like you, move on girl! he's not worth stressing over. hope i helped|`|Rx31LHjbaa	Maybe he was just taken off-guard by you coming right out and saying it, and didn't really know how to respond off the top of his head.  Or there could be something going on in his personal life that would prevent him from saying that he liked you, even if he does.  (For example, he could be talking to another girl first, and not want to go behind her back.)  It's hard to say just from one conversation.  Just give it a little more time and see how he reacts.|`|6nElnyzEaa	That's like him saying it was great to meet you at the end of a date. He's Just Not That Into You was a great informational movie. Watch it some time.|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	Yep, isn't it obvious?I don't understand why girls tell guys they like them its stupid and embarrassing....|`|mjjhTUVEaa	yea sorry babe you were rejected lol
ZNhP3mpUaa	don't worry about it. my wife went in at 30 weeks, said she is measuring 32 weeks and kept her original due date... that just means baby is growing faster then your levels were showing... there is nothing wrong with carrying bigger. My wife because of this will also probably deliver between 36-38 weeks instead of the "full" 40... good luck!|`|Hhk78c5Gaa	You think that's bad... I was measuring like 42 weeks when I was only 37 or 38!|`|AA11542929	itsokay.. dont worry.. my brother was born 3 days early measured at 10% bigger then a normal baby and he came out looking 3 months.. it just mean sur eating and takng care of urself! congrats
rpnFxnCQaa	It seems to me that you are "just" being nervous. Talk to your doctor. And ... breathe! I am sure you have heard that before :-).<br>  <br>  Then again, you mentioned anxiety attacks. To get rid of anxiety attacks in a 100% natural way, you may want to try this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  It worked for me. I had suffered from GAD for years before I found out about that technique. I had tried medicines but they did not fix the problem and I wanted to avoid the side effects.<br>  <br>  The key to get rid of anxiety attacks is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. <br>  <br>  All the best to you and your baby!|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i have this problem and yoga change all of that. every since i started yoga i learn new ways to deal with my anxiety. i feel so much better, more relax and when i feel a attack coming on i have new ways to deal with it. i am not the "yoga type" but i started taking it for stress and it helps allot with mind,body . you really should try it, people think i preach about yoga so much but it changed my life.<br>  <br>  ps. i don't do the HOT yoga. my doctor said that hot yoga is not that good well your pregnant. but regular yoga is ok!|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	I have the exact same thing only I am not Preg.<br>  Allot of relaxation cds and meditation can help, but afraid I had to take meds...<br>  This could be down to the fact your sub conscience is worried, new baby on the way etc etc...<br>  It may calm down once u give birth...<br>  Hope u feel better soon x|`|gyixPyOsaa	you can take anxiety meds when you are pregnant it won't hurt the baby. if anything it will help keep the babies heart rate low when you are panicking. when your heart rate goes up so does the babies i would talk to your dr about getting a low does medication like xanax or lorazepam to take when you feel them coming on. because not only are they really scary for you the baby gets stressed during them too.|`|PfLg9B6aaa	I have anxiety attacks before pregnancy.They started after i rolled my suburban almost 2 years ago when I was 16.  I just breathe slowly and calm myself and usually my husband is here to calm  me down or wake me up because I get them in my sleep to but lately I haven't had any that I know of.  Im sure when it gets closer to labor I will or like you I can not be in a room I know Im not allowed to leave.  I try to look out windows and think of other things that I have going on.  It seems to work the best for me.|`|eus7WqzUaa	If your parents are the ones keeping you in your room you need to talk to them.  If your with a man who is keeping you in your room there are plenty of domestic violence programs that will help you and your baby.<br>  <br>  My advice.  Watch a funny movie and think of the funny parts when something enters your mind that makes you panic.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is hormones but without you telling us more that is really all I can think of|`|RPoFBenJaa	Well, what you need to try really hard to do is step out of your mind. Close your eyes, breath reaaaaaalllly slowly in your nose and out your mouth. Try to think of something in your head that is really relaxing like the waves at the beach or the sound of a wind chime on a porch in the summer. Something like that. I have anxiety really bad and it was worse when i was preggo and I did this. Its a sort of self hynosis type of thing. I learned how to do it when I was hynotized once. It works wonders. Give it a try.|`|xytNERzlaa	I started getting panick attacks when I wa pregnant with my daughter. The doctor said it was stress, her dads an a**hole. So whenever I started to feel like it coming on I would try to keep calm and remind myself that I'd be ok and it would pass soon. I also always tried to have somehting to drink(water, juice) around to try to take my mind off of it.|`|oche3k5taa	why would you be trapped in a room where you cant leave?  I have bad anxiety, and horrible panic attacks, and when i go into one, i have to have a loved one hold me, really tight and let me cry. so try doing that...but ive never really been in a situation where i cant just leave a room, so i dont know girl = /|`|eMSP740Taa	Why would you be in a room and not allowed to leave?? To relax your mind while you are going through these incidences you should maybe listen to relaxing soft music and just close your eyes, breathe in deep and try to focus on the music. Perhaps this will help. Good luck with everything and i hope i helped a bit!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Sounds like hormones.  I know my cousin was on a very very low dose of anti anxiety when preggo.  However--I suffer from them too and I am always able to talk myself "down" from an attack.  Try slow, deep breathing--even though it feels like you cant breathe.  Also--cold air helps to.  <br>  <br>  be sure to talk to your Dr about this too.  A lot of things can cause panic attacks.  One of them being thyroid issues...which is very common for women to get during pregnancy.|`|ppyaqtZGaa	I have bad panic attacks and have had them ever since I was a kid.  What I usually do is get a friend to come over or call someone on the phone and try to get my mind off of it.  Slowly, but surely I have taught myself how to talk myself out of one.|`|XEQKAYFraa	meditation and deep rhythmic breathing help|`|7QRq8b4baa	My first question is who is locking you in a room? Secondly, I had the same issues, and just had to overcome them through exercise and meditation. If you can get through them nine months without meds, you have a good chance at strengthening your mental capacities so that you never need to take meds again, but you can just "talk yourself" out of them. I learned how to do it and though it is really difficult, it is possible. Your baby is not sure to end up having this problem. Though anxiety might run in a family, I think it is influenced by environment more than by biology, though they both certainly play a part. Good luck, you can do it.|`|XUg7o1Waaa	Ok, stop and listen to this carefully. When you are in the room how do you feel, be more specific. How many weeks or months pregnant, also, be more specific. It may be the excessive hormones produced by your body for your baby. It may be that the older you get the more you are effected by this certain trait. Ask your parents if either one of them had this problem, or ask your mom if she felt this way when pregnant with you. If it continues then she your obstetrician, she/he can help you with this, whether it be by medication or a small therapy session, both may help with this problem and it is most likeley not genetic.|`|AA10759365	St. John's wort is considered a medium strength anti-depressant with possible anti-anxiety benefits. It is available over the counter. Other than that B-complex vitamins and Omega-3 fish oil are said to help somewhat. Anxiety is usually just a physical manifestation of some fear. If the fear can be overcome you may find a relief in your anxiety. Also, massage is rumored to be very beneficial in treating anxiety as it is an excellent stress reliever.|`|EKgfxA80aa	It is probably hormones,I find breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth really helps,but ask your doctor if they continue to get worse. Also not that I'm recommending this as I'm not a doctor but I was on Paxil 15 mg for anxiety with both pregnancy's and had no ill effects from it although I also did not breastfeed.<br>  Hope this helps
xb6uZrluaa	If you have a baby and a cat you should get the cat declawed if it scatches the baby feces can get under the skin past that there is no real danger.  The old myth that cats steal babys breath was made because when babys ate the cat would lick the milk of the babys mouth and it could sufficate the child but if you clean your babys mouth with a damp rag after feeding that will eliminate that problem as well|`|DN6XtoViaa	there is a small risk having a cat while TTC.. but its really really small. just don't clean the litter... or if you are the only one to do it then just wear thick gloves.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's fine. I have 4 cats and a baby. During pregnancy it's best to avoid changing the litter box because of a parasite called toxoplasmosis that can be carried by hunting cats. As far as the baby goes, cats and babies normally go well together. I keep my son's bedroom door closed when he is sleeping so the cats don't bother him but that's it. They normally steer clear of him.<br>  <br>  Toxoplasmosis is also found in dirt and raw meat so as always wash your hands well.<br>  <br>  I should add that none of my cat's are declawed. A declawed cat can only defend it's self by biting and 50% of cat bites get severely infected. My brother was hospitalized for a week for a cat bite a few years ago. My cats have only scratched my son in self defense which I certainly don't blame them for.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Having a cat does not prevent preganancy. (I WOULD recommend throwing the cat out of your bed while you are actively TTC...)<br>  <br>  And there is no harm in having a cat in the house when you have a baby.  It's just an old wives tale that cats will 'steal baby's breath' or smother baby by trying to lick the milk from his mouth.
ghz5D5iLaa	Yes we still act like a couple even after 16 years of marriage. You started out as a couple and too many people forget that. You still need to keep the marriage alive. My mother in law always tells us to get a room even for holding hands. Jealousy I would say.|`|MeYILJeSaa	We do, but we don't get teased for it.<br>  My husband still makes time to give me a few kisses, and tell me how much he appreciates me, etc.<br>  It's normal for me, I was lucky growing up in a home where I saw my parents show their affection for each other every day. I want the same for my kids. <br>  I think it is important to continue to set aside time for your partner-it;s more beneficial to the kids that way. They can sense when they're parents are cut off from each other.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Yes we still act like a couple.  We don't get teased for it at all.  All my still married aunts told me how important it is to make sure you make time for your spouse after having kids.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Yep, we act like a couple in private, but no one teases us. Most people outside the home (before and after marriage and kids) assumed we were co-workers or something in public. We're both socially reserved people, PDA is so not my thing, and we don't act like a couple in public, but the spark's definitely still there, if not stronger, when we're alone.<br>  We do date night whenever we can (his work keeps him a lot, but we find time ;) ), and are very cuddly in the privacy of our own home.<br>  <br>  ETA: my parents were/are very much the same way as we are: quiet in public, no shame among family. They're so sweet I feel like I'm getting diabeeettuus every time I see them snogging each other.|`|4iXL4C6paa	We try to do cuddle and all that but we always have a kid in the middle lol seriously are childen are 6,3,2 and 5 1/2 months so we are not as romantic as we used to be|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We still act very much like a couple, although neither of us are much into displaying physical attention in front of other people. Instead we laugh and tease each other when other people are around. We do the cuddling when we're alone. We don't get teased, but almost all of our friends tell us we're the perfect couple and most of them come to us when they're having problems in their own relationship. I tell them to talk it out, and my husband tells them to let the woman do whatever she wants. Lots of laughs there.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	If we happen to go out with a group of friends and we're acting like we did before children, yes we're teased for pda. I find it to be cute, because that just shows the love we both have for one another. I can't keep my hands off my husband.

pXSKSS3daa	I don't believe in blindly trusting your child's doctor but I see nothing wrong when you, as your son's parent, trust his doctor. As long as you are keeping yourself well informed TOO then there is no reason for others to think you are stupid or misinformed.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It isn't. Some people on here just think their way is the best or only way. I think that you and your son's doctor knows him better than anyone else so ya'll know what is right. If you trust his doctor and he gave you advice that you agree with and you've done the research, go with your instincts. You're his mom, not anyone else. Do what's right for him and ignore others. I'm pretty sure that his doctor went to medical school a lot longer than anyone criticizing you on Yahoo Answers! Don't know what this was all about, but I assume you had trouble with a previous post..anyway...Hope I made you feel better! Just be the best mommy you can and ignore negative people!|`|vCWVimTzaa	I think these women must not have a good relationship with their pediatrician. For the most part my pediatrician and I are on the same page, and have similar beliefs when it comes to what is best for my daughter. she is also very supportive of our decision to use an alternate vaccination schedule. I trust her and respect her opinions and when she recommends something I take it seriously. If someone doesnt feel that way about any doctor, I think it would be time to find a new doctor!|`|lGcpXteaaa	I go by my peds advice if it makes sense. If i know somethings wrong and he gives me an answer and treatment, i will follow it.<br>  But sometimes peds go by the 'norm' which sometimes doesnt apply to your child. Like for height and weight. <br>  I know my child best and if i think i have a better solution, i will follow my own advice.<br>  <br>  It has worked well for me so far! And I love my ped!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	It's NOT wrong if you're not going against your instincts.  If you trust your doctor good on you, and keep a hold of him if he's a good one!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	If he is doing the right thing an not going against your instinct you aren't wrong for trusting him. The problem is doctors who give outdated advice and parents who don't do research to make sure the have both sides of things. Most people just follow what their doctor tells them and a degree doesn't mean you are infallible or always right. Parents should get as much info from different sources as possible before deciding on something whether it's vaccinating, circumcising or using CIO. They should not just follow what one person says. Trusting a good doctor isn't wrong but even a good one should be questioned.
uVPAXpj7aa	a pregnancy test would do the trick.<br>  if your stomach is getting big, it means you'd be months into the pregnancy (if you are pregnant) and therefore you would've missed a few periods. that's a good giveaway.|`|wohGR1Nkaa	you don't get a bump until about 3 months so I am not sure you might just be bloated.<br>  Just try and relax and maybe wait until the time is right to take a test.

But, if you're a fun, outgoing, good person, then there's gonna be a lot of people that do like you. From your picture I can tell that you're obviously not the ugly duckling anymore. So be confident with how you look and just smile all the time and generally be fun to be around.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the singing thing, that's pretty normal that you're scared. You just gotta forget everything and do it, you don't really have anything to lose, just a lot to gain. You could really surprise yourself.

oiJITSNZaa	Sorry  Friend I know the let down feeling all too well. Yes its possible that you don't have enough of the pg hormone in your system for it to show up on the test. I would recommend waiting a few days and if your period doesn't start and you still have a negative to go to your doctor and get a blood test...that is a much more sensitive test. Best Wishes|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	you should go and buy another test and if that one does the same go to the doctor and get a blood test done.. baby dust your way..|`|C8C7eIBbaa	yeah those tests are not very reliable. that happened to my friend and then she had a miscarriage because she didnt know. whenever you take a test you always have to do it with the first pee of the day because that is when the hormones are most detectable. otherwise go to a doctor. goodluck!|`|aMkWajC7aa	get a new pregnancy kit again, maybe the one u used was expired already...

Put yourself in your baby's position.  She has been near you for 10 months now.  You are her whole universe!  You provide her nourishment, love, protection and security.  The first couple of months it is HARD.  It is tiring.  Don't bother trying to do anything around the house yet.  You'll just get frustrated.  Your only focus right now should be her.  Take her to bed with you and snuggle.  Watch some Tv, read some magazines.  Just try to enjoy her littleness.  It won't last much longer.  You'll get through this hard stage of Motherhood and look back on it with love and great baby memories.  Congratulations!|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	At her age it is normal to not really get much done around the house.

pzLDXL6gaa	If you go straight from one pill to another without a break (or without any more than the normal 7 day break) you're usually protected. But Yaz only has a 4 day break so I'm not sure. Pill leaflets usually say if you're protected when switching from another pill. Check out <a href="http://www.yaz.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yaz.com</a> or google it. If you're not sure, better be safe than sorry and use condoms for a week.<br>  <br>  Harriet
9a3sNrEqaa	actually weight does have to do with fertility TRUST ME! I weighed about 90 lbs (unhealthy)  before my hubby and I wanted to have a baby. Apparently it can cause ovulation to stop bc your body is not at a proper homeostasis causing anovulatory cycles. I had this and was put on Clomid and had to gain some weight. This is something you will want to talk aout with your dr. I am 103 and pregnant now. So you really need to make sure that your eating healthy. But you weigh 105 and thats not soooo bad you know? I would really set up an appt to talk with your dr about it. GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!! Tons of baby dust!!!!!|`|AA10254927	I am 5'2" and for the past 2-3 yrs always weighed anywhere between 110-115. However about a yr ago I lost weight for my wedding and went down to 100-102 maybe. And I conceived at this weight!!! So I dont think weight is an issue. <br>  Yes, once u conceive, you have to be careful about yout diet etc so you dont continue your starving habits.. but it all works out!<br>  <br>  Talk to your gynae. Get some blood-work done to pacify your anxities. That ways you'll know if your diet is deficient in any way and you can work on that.<br>  <br>  GoodLuck hon. :)|`|sj3BK68Waa	You can get pregnant because you still have your periods but it also depends if you have a healthy body mass index,and if you are eating properly, this is important for the baby development but people are naturally thin and still get pregnant.|`|F83M10rlaa	When I got pg with my 1st child i started at 95 pounds and end at 130.

Being overweigh can cause problems, but not underweight.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I weighed 106 and 5'4 when I got pregnant with this pregnancy.  I was slightly bigger (a few pounds) when I got pregnant with my first.  And then chasing after an active child, took off a few pounds.  As long as you get your period then I don't see that there will be problem in regard to your weight.  You might have other issues or perhaps the timing hasn't been exactly right for you yet.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I wish you baby dust.|`|v3LnJycKaa	your not too small, i was 5'4 and close too 100 when i got preggo with my first.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	your bmi is only 18, so yes, you are underweight. <br>   But seriously, I think you know that since you are wearing a size one or zero.  If I was you, I try to gain 5 or 10 pounds.<br>    Sometimes the human body knows it doesnt have enough 'fat' to sustain another life. Obviously, by reading some of these answers it isnt always an issue, but it MAY be foryou.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Being below 18% body fat could cause you to not ovulate. If you are getting your period, then you are most likely still ovulating. <br>  <br>  You could increase your caloric intake a bit to put on a few pounds though, it sounds like it wouldn't hurt.|`|Xly2sF6waa	My aunt was like 95lbs when she got pregnant.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	you're size has nothing to do with fertility.
4Bgw5xs8aa	I used one on my baby when she was 2 months. She had been constipated a while..but after an hour, nothing happened. I called the nurse, and she told me to take her temp rectally and that would stimulate the poo to come out. It worked great, and we have done that ever since. The suppositories never worked for my wee one. Though your daughter's situation may be different, so I would definitely call her doc or the after hour line and ask.|`|TluWzYAJaa	Don't take any of our answers over your Doctor.  All I can say is my littles ones would occasionally get backed up and I tried a little trick my Pediatrician told me about.  Take a rectal thermometer with a little bit of lubricant on it.  Just put it in her rear 1/4" or so. NOT VERY MUCH.  Sometimes that is enough to get her going.  Again, consult with your Doc first.|`|0p9wHjSWaa	^<br>  ^<br>  <br>  My sis had to do the same thing, as gross as it sounds, it works.|`|ORpbq3bAaa	i worked for a pediatrician and i use to take the babies temperature rectally and i will come all out even if i wasnt trying to. give it a try. not to far in
dzyJw0cvaa	There is nothing wrong with what you are doing with your parents.  Its good that you have a close bond with them.  I say screw your friends.  What is normal anyway?  Normal is just a gudeline we go by that really doesnt mean anything.  For you, it would be abnormal for your parents not to read to you at night.  Dont let your friends bother you.  You are you and thats all that matters, not their opinions.  :)|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Ummm if you wanna read with your mom and hang with her that is cool...but honestly you are a little too old for bedtime stories....But if that is something you guys do together to bond then I dnt think you should stop...|`|y3u5WYDMaa	yaa not rlly normal<br>  my parents stopped at lk age 9|`|JFr7fCiXaa	why not if you still enjoy it?|`|y8p5GHaZaa	I think thats nice.  Most people don't do that because most parents don't care enough or have the time.  You get to spend time with your family and read also, so I think it is a good thing (assuming that you can also ready on your own and go to sleep on your own).|`|wITZ6ltYaa	It's different but that's awesome...kids nowadays aren't close to their parents! so who cares! if you're close to your parents,THAT'S GREAT, cuz in the end, they're all you have. friends come and go. so do whatever you want to keep close to them :)|`|BzvstX7uaa	Ya that's pretty odd, to be honest. You are almost an adult and can read to yourself. At that age,  if I wanted to read, I picked up a book and read myself to sleep. So ya, it's odd to me.<br>  <br>  =) but its not hurting anyone I guess|`|vsEWHCuhaa	My mom occasionally reads a little kid book to us all.....My Dad used to read Narnia to me when I was 11.. I could read but I liked that we shared the time together etc. So no I don't think you should stop it...just make sure you know how to read too!|`|6nElnyzEaa	I think it's weird that she reads to you. Why don't you read to yourself? And it's good that you have a good relationship with your parents. But you aren't 3 anymore.|`|adcCJrNxaa	That is a bit strange. If your parents don't mind doing it then why stop it b/c your friends made fun of you? If it ain't broke then y try to fix it!? It is strange though.....|`|zG9EprFjaa	Haha whatever who cares. You wont be a kid for long enjoy it.|`|4RAboDSDaa	It isn't exactly nomal but...if you still enjoy it then it doesn't matter!|`|HtHltQgWaa	These days most families don't have time for that, but I don't think there's anything abnormal about it - most people just don't do it. I definitely don't think there is any need to stop. It's a great way to spend time together. I say, enjoy this time! You are lucky. I like being read to and I'm almost 30 now.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	At 17years old i think its a bit odd, as you can read to yourself. But if thats what you like to do with your parents then its not hurting anyone.|`|ipiCyE3zaa	its a bit strange, if you can already read by yourself
ZEYEmYRtaa	If u r late on your period then you can take a test.. If it is neg then wait another few days and test again if it is once again neg, then maybe just a late period. Talk to you gp about your concerns<br>  Good luck x|`|em8A42Bqaa	I waited until I missed a couple of periods before I actually tested,  If you are excited to know I would wait a week and take  the EPT test.|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	here we go again....<br>  <br>  if you had sex and didnt use protection, YES you can be <br>  <br>  pregnant :)<br>  <br>  I would take a test on saturday|`|dq9uclgpaa	Take the test now since you've missed your period. If it's negative go talk to your doctor.
GWveqx61aa	ive never used it, but i heard a cheaper  alternitive to it, and i tried it, egg white, i used pasturized, and it worked great as a lube,i did ask the dr about this and he says thats fine to use, also he said olive oil. af is not due til march 1st so idk if it worked, but google it, i read alot of success stories for first time users, ps make sure not to use the yolk, thats where the bacteria is, good luck and baby dust to us all|`|0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	I used it two months ago for the first time and I got pregnant.|`|fG727pkuaa	I've been using it for a few months now. It's just a lubricant thats sperm friendly, nothing fancy that helps you to get pregnant.
zwJbUbWMaa	If he didn't make it in far enough to make you bleed then I guess you would still be considered a virgin.  It just seems a little silly the things that some girls will do now just to be able to say they are still a virgin.  Some girls have anal sex every weekend but still claim that they are a virgin.  I would like to know where you can draw the line between being sexually active and still be a virgin.|`|BfhGumxYaa	u r not a virgin but its ur choce what u call ur self
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You would go to the labor and delivery department, not the ER. <br>  <br>  You should take a hospital tour of where you're going to deliver. They'll tell you everything you need to know when you get there.<br>  <br>  ETA: OK, I guess it depends on the hospital. I've never heard of going to the ER first, though.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	You go straight to labor. As from I herd. Some people said you go to the ER. We aren't sure. I asked some people I know (women) over the phone, and no one is really sure.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Go straight to labor and delivery.  It would actually be better if you called labor and delivery right before you leave so that way they can get a room together for you so your not waiting for one.  But if you dont have time to call before, then just go to the labor and delivery.  Going to the ER is wasting your time and their time.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'm in the UK, my pregnancy notes say that i've got to call up labour and delivery when it's time and tell them that i'm heading in so they can be prepared for me arriving.<br>  <br>  So you would go straight to the L&D ward.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Well for me, I went straight to the labor and delivery. But in some hospitals, they'll either put you straight to the E.R or Labor and Delivery|`|WPI0Z47saa	Call your doctor first to let them know and they will let you know if it is "time" then you would go straight to labor and delivery.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Labor and Delivery!<br>  <br>  I was in pre-term labor and the regular ER sent me to the Labor and Delivery unit. Also during the Stork Tour, they said to come straight to the Labor and Delivery. =D|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Hospital tour is good for questions like this.  Especially at night, how do you get in?  They usually tell you all that and things you didn't even think of|`|JreuGwJYaa	Where I live you go to labor and delivery for anything if your past 20 weeks.|`|4iXL4C6paa	At our hospital we go to the ER but they take us straight to labor and delivery it may be different at other hospitals
AA11286455	Totally normal.  I think children this age are testing the adult's limits as, well as their own, esp. if they're not talking all that much or not talking very well yet.  <br>  <br>  She has a harder time expressing what she wants, feels, thinks, etc.  Slamming doors, upending furniture, hitting people and things, crying unconsolably are really good substitutes in place of words.  <br>  <br>  --Work with her on this.  "Name" things and emotions for her:  You threw that toy, are you  mad?  We don't throw things in our house when we are mad.  We do (or say)...xyz.  <br>  <br>  --Re-direct her WELL BEFORE the behavior starts to get on your nerves or she acts like she's starting to exploit you.  She knows what 'gets your goat' and she's going to go for it, unless you beat her to the punch.  <br>  <br>  --It is also a good idea to learn to ignore some niggling behaviors and to overall pick and choose your battles and non-negotiables--throwing a soft toy vs. a hard plastic or metal one, hitting you vs. hitting the walls or furniture,....<br>  <br>  --This is an important age and behavioral time of life when parents and pre-school teachers need to teach children self-control, so do your best not to loose YOURS.  Children do live what they learn.   <br>  <br>  --She's not too young to learn the meaning of the phrase:  TIME OUT.  Follow through.  <br>  <br>  Young children are not going to "get" self-control in a day or two and not even in a month or two.  Also, you may win one war, only to discover that there's a new battle brewing.  <br>  <br>  Finally, in all things BE CONSISTENT.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Yes, very normal.  Ever hear of "Terrible Two's"?|`|01b7b33ffd86cc43730eda548838c61eaa	Read 'The Science of Parenting<br>  Practical guidance on sleep, crying, play and building<br>  emotional wellbeing for life'<br>  by Margot Sunderland, published by Dorling Kindersley. That's all I would say. Be prepared to have your long held suspicions confirmed, and some modern child 'care' practices challenged.|`|wE5JMeesaa	Absolutely.  <br>  The biggest mistake you can make as a parent is giving in.  Set your standards for what is acceptable and what is not, set consequences for actions, and STICK TO IT.  If you're diligent, your terrible twos will be terrible months or terrible weeks--rather than years.|`|z7l0BF1raa	Way normal!  put her on a schedule if she knows whats next it will help.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Yes, it's normal.  I have two like that.|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Yes it is normal is limit testing stage. Use lots of time outs when she's bad and lots of love when she's good. Like thank you so much for putting that toy away or thank you so much for listening or using your words. Stick to time outs when bad no matter what and make sure there is no TV on or toys near her wall in time out.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	if she continues to act like that in a year or so, she may have ODD. I have had Oppositional Defiant Disorder since I was three. It's actually fairly common and can resolve itself. Mine never did. I always tested my mother's limits as a child and even worse as a teen. always talked back. Acted out whenever I didn't get what i wanted. i was terrible.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Of course it's normal.............she's testing her boundaries...........children are soooooo much smarter than we give them credit for!!!|`|4iXL4C6paa	I have a two year old also and that sounds about right lol|`|nDEVWjCEaa	Terrible twos.... im going threw it too... so not fun!!!
FUBNkpwSaa	I too had a miscarriage exactly 7 weeks ago, and since my d and c my husband and I have been at it every day trying to get pregnant again. 4 weeks after the miscarriage i took a test and it said i was still pregnant.. but i recently took another test (1 day ago) and it turned out negative.<br>  <br>  I am super happy for you, it seems like you're pregnant!!<br>  I still haven't had my period yet so I'm hoping I am too.<br>  <br>  ~~Best Wishes!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Seven weeks is plenty of time to get the hormone out of your system.  There are two options here.  You are either pregnant again, or you were pregnant with twins the first time and only one of them passed, the other survived.  It will make a difference in your due date.  I suggest you find a midwife for the best and safest possible birth experience, and she will likely set you up to do an ultrasound to measure for dating and then she will work with you the rest of the way.  Congrats|`|TGzOrftPaa	Following a miscarriage the pregnancy hormone can still be detected for up to 2 months.  It's possible that you took the test and it's picking up your miscarriage hormones.  However, the only way to know for sure right now would be to go to the doctor and have them do bloodwork or an ultrasound, which I would recommend because if you are pregnant you'll want to have your prenatal care as soon as possible!  Either way, going to the doctor wouldn't hurt.  Otherwise wait at least 2 weeks and take another home pregnancy test.  Good luck.|`|98WKYtfwaa	The HCG hormone wouldn't be in your system 7 weeks after miscarrying, it takes 2weeks at the most to clear out your system.<br>  <br>  Have you had sex since your miscarriage? You're either pregnant again, or like the other user said you were pregnant with twins and only passed one. <br>  <br>  See your doctor and they'll give you an ultrasound to see how far along you are.|`|B0bWrvanaa	make an appt with your doctor and see what they say. it could be that your pregnant or that your miscariage hasnt left your system and the hormone that shows the test that youre pregnant is still there.|`|2HX9sIwpaa	your pregnant again, congratulation!|`|InslW3QMaa	well if you did it then you probably are if the test said so Congrats|`|65RZ441Zaa	If you've had unprotected sex you could absolutely be pregnant. You should read the fine print for the test, most will say the chances of the test working is decreased if you've been pregnant of miscarried in the last 6 weeks.|`|C3Bxc9wzaa	with a miscarriage your hormones can last in your body for an extended time, that's why you got a false positive...|`|JreuGwJYaa	either or your going to have to go get a blood test to check your hcg levels and then you'll know for sure.
qxnZXOVFaa	totally normal|`|ORpbq3bAaa	poop can be any color and its normal. but once you see blood or its completly black then you need to inform your doc|`|AA10753286	i to would say this is normal, dont worry, i think its just the babys system changing, and at this age they change all the time.
cSm1zod4aa	If he is wanting you to move in with him, then I doubt he is doing things that he shouldn't be doing. Don't worry about the friend that is a girl, there is a reason she is a friend and not more like you. Plus I guarantee if you already lived with him, he would want you there so do not feel neglected. If you are already having trouble trusting him fighting about silly things like this, then you may want to reconsider moving in with him. This is not a reason for you to break it off with him, give him a chance. And are you sure you are not already pregnant, because this kind of sounds like it might be hormones? Just calm down and everything will be okay.|`|bzQNHfunaa	i hate 2 b the "bearer of bad news" but sounds like 2 me honey he is uncommitted 2 u...this "friend" probably isnt "just a friend" if he's hanging out with her agai. if i was u id do some hard core souls searching b4 i made the leap 2 move in with him!|`|KPpVj0Yraa	play it cool, and watch what he does, at the same time tell him how you feel when he does what he does. if you sense that hes cheating on you or whatever, investigate. yea i know its wrong to go through peoples stuff but go through his phone and see his text messages, go on his myspace/facebook/email and check his emails. if you see any flirtatious behavior going on that's when you should start to worry. Talk to his friends[the boys] and ask them what the deal is. then talk to his lady friends and ask them about there relationship[as friends, or more than friends]. once you gather enough proof that hes cheating on you, dump his ***!<br>  but, if you find out its all fake and they really are 'just friends'...well good for you.|`|k1lGJ2Onaa	I agree with Larry R.<br>  If he doesnt show that he cares about your feelings now, then he wont show nor try to care for them later.<br>  Children arent something to have because you move in together. Having a child bonds you with that person for 18 years, regardless of how your relationship works out in the end.<br>  Good luck, I hope you find out nothing is going wrong, or he is really a loser and he gets lost.<br>  Seriously, ignoring feelings is the next step to being ignored and you being home alone with your child while he's out with 'friends'.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Why in the hell are you "trying for a baby" with someone you aren't married to??<br>  <br>  Look, FIRST you MARRY the guy.  THEN you move in with him, THEN you "try for a baby".  Sheeshh!<br>  <br>  If he lacks the moral fiber and maturity  to be willing to commit to having a wife, how in the heck is he going to have anything NEAR the moral fiber and maturity needed to be a FATHER??<br>  <br>  IF he won't marry you, dump his but and find a REAL GROWN UP MAN.<br>  <br>  Why on Earth are you letting this immature looser use you and your body like this?|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	He probably didnt tell you that there was going to be a girl there because he was afraid that you would react negatively. He shouldnt tell you he will be at home by 9-10 and not get home til 2am, but you also shouldnt expect him to follow a "curfew" especially if you arent living there yet. He is probably trying to avoid a fight, but he is not building any trust by acting the way he is acting. Unfortunately, he is going to do what he is going to do regardless of what you say. You either have to trust him or you must leave him. Its tough but true. Sorry.

Colin is ok but Nixon? are you sure its a name the boy would get picked on for having.|`|LQetTtM9aa	Not bad choices :-)  <br>  I think Bonnie Katelyn sounds better; I also like the sound of Bonnie Amanda.<br>  I like Colin McKai for the boy; not fond of Nixon myself (the actual name, or the former president,lol)<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped :-)|`|2uOhDMKjaa	I like Kate (one of my favorite girl names) but bonnie is way old school.

FHT6wsUpaa	The first time I felt my daughter's hiccups, I was about 7 months along. It felt like someone was tapping me on the side. The further along (and bigger) I got, it became more and more pronounced. Towards the end, I could see my belly twitch with each hiccup. My daughter had them at least three times a day most days.<br>  <br>  The funniest was when I was 38 weeks. I went to L&D for unexplained bleeding one night (turned out to be nothing...got sent home and didn't have her for another 3 weeks). They hooked me up to the monitors, and kept me overnight because *of course* I started having contractions while I was there. The baby got the hiccups...and when they turned up the sound, I could hear them. Not the actual hiccup, of course, but just the sound that was created from the movement in my belly. It was hilarious. She moved and kicked and hiccupped so much that night the nurses had to keep coming in and readjusting the monitors on my belly...she kept kicking them off!<br>  <br>  Best of luck! It's such a neat feeling.|`|z6O5ifdGaa	They feel like light kicks but are rhythmic, every couple of seconds... and a bit more like a flutter than a kick.<br>  <br>  My son has them once a day at least when I was pregnant|`|MeYILJeSaa	Hiccups are a lot more rhythmic than kicks. :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	LOL when u feel them, you will know, by gal had them ALL the time, it is a funky feeling...she even had them a lot as a nb and the first couple mos....best wishes
c8DjmWXxaa	why do people moan about people moaning, what's the point.<br>  did you ask this question on here just to blow your own trumpet, well in that case.. WHOOP DEE F*CK*NGDOO FOR YOU.<br>  my girl and i had a terrible time, we nearly lost our son on 3 separate occasions, thank god and god bless the doctors and surgeons, and shame on you for being so arrogant.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I don't get the impression that women sound sad and moan all the time at all. Many women do get concerned about things, but it isn't whining - they're *concerned* about their health and that of the baby. <br>  <br>  Some women, when they answer, do tell the truth about their morning sickness, any problems they had, etc. I don't think that's "sad and moaning" either, it's them telling their experiences so that other women can be helped by it (i.e. knowing it's normal). <br>  <br>  I think, for the most part, women on here are very happy they're pregnant. Just because you're happy you're pregnant, though, doesn't mean you're happy about throwing up all day long.|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	Sometimes it is hormonal,<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is genuine, due to life and other things happening for the mother<br>  Sometimes the baby was not a planned pregnancy and the mother is upset because there are certain things in her life that she feels she will be unable to fulfil now or not for a ling time due to having a child.<br>  <br>  BUT most of the time, the reason is an absence of gratitude.|`|BKxAt8mNaa	I am sure most ARE very happy, but they appear moany on here all the time to you, because this IS afterall, a place to sort out problems! No point on seeking resolution to a problem unless you have a problem!<br>  And yes, ALOT of problems and complications can come with pregnancy.|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Im very up beat and happy with my pregnancy, but it hasnt been like that all the way through. <br>  <br>  We all like to off load sometimes, mainly due to our hormones, but we can relate to millions of different women in simular situations. x|`|sLERr3aAaa	Yeah I'm going to ***** and moan when i can't ******* sleep because my hips hurts, my ribs hurt I can't breath and it's so difficult turning over.

I couldn't even roll over without puking.<br>  And now, I am bed rest for preeclampsia. So I have pretty much spent 6 months on the couch, and I'm sick of it. Board outta my mind.<br>  I also look like a tiger.

All I did was complain and cry my first 3 months.  But I think it was b/c my friend lost her baby and I was nervous about mine.  Once I saw my little peanut on the sonogram...I was happy as could be most days.  But my hormones went a little crazy sometimes and I had my days.  As happy as i was---I truly, truly could not help the mood swings or stop the tears.|`|UDsdqE05aa	When you have another kid, that's when you sound moody and sad.

I am pregnant I have the right to be pissed off.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Maybe they don't enjoy talking to someone who tells them to be happy after having an easy pregnancy, while feeling miserable, bloated and aching.<br>  <br>  -I'm sure people trying really hard to get pregnant would be more irritated by you telling them how great the whole thing was, than by people complaining about the genuine discomforts and health problems that come with being pregnant.|`|buoqtZeFaa	I complain mostly about being in pain a lot.  I think the end result of pregnancy is a happy time but some women have trouble going through it.  For me this is my first pregnancy I had NO IDEA what to expect since my body is different from all the pregnancy women I have talked to.  I don't think everybody hates pregnancy but at times it cam get really hard.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	It depends how you're pregnancy went!  As happy as I was, I moaned at the beginning because I had morning sickness up to 15 weeks then I was happy as larry, then in the last trimester I suffered with crippling heart burn, which was almost more painful than labour.  <br>  <br>  I never moaned about actually *being* pregnant, just moaned about pains!|`|em8A42Bqaa	Good for you.  I hate being pregnant so what....  Since you like being pregnant so much you can have 100 more babies and live happily ever after.
zk3Bp9uNaa	My baby has sat low throughout the pregnancy - some babies are more comfortable there.<br>  <br>  I have been in early labour - at 22weeks and it stopped on its own.<br>  <br>  My baby fully engaged at 28weeks, so i have been told i will have her early. I am now 31weeks. Anytime from now your baby has a great chance at survival if born, without many risks. But they can stop labour if you go too early. Speak to your Dr about it - they will be able to tell you if you are dialated at all. Sometimes babies just settle into position early, and are still over due, so dont worry too much|`|hoX7hoINaa	My baby is extremely low too, however I'm almost 36 weeks now (he's been sitting low since 31 weeks) and I have yet to dilate. Dr appt tomorrow and hoping that I am at least progressing. Some just sit lower than others.

This is prefect for a girl. Middle name for Taylor maybe Rose and for Tyler Catherine? <br>  Amanda - I dislike this name, sorry for being negative maybe Audrey? If you do go with Amanda middle name maybe Jade? <br>  Kaitlynn - Now this is beautiful meaning pure girl the spelling is fine have you thought of the spelling Caitlin? This name utterly priceless middle name maybe Evangeline? <br>  Amber - this is fantastic name meaning precious orange jewel very cute middle name maybe Jane? <br>  I hope I helped in some way sorry for being slightly negative. God bless!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Kaitlynn is ok but I would spell it either Katelyn or Caitlyn if it were me or just use Kate.

Amber is really beautiful, and it goes perfectly with Amanda and Katelynn. I LOVE the spelling Katelyn or Katelynn... I really think that it makes the name beautiful, elegant, and sophisticated.

If you still enjoy the name "Tyler", there is a female, or girl version, "Taylor".  "Taylor" means "a tailor" and is originally from English.<br>  <br>  "Amanda" means "she who must be loved", and originally from Latin.<br>  <br>  "Kaitlynn" means "pure", and originally from Gaelic.<br>  <br>  "Amber" is originally from English.|`|i3FgiLENaa	Those are stupid<br>  Kaitlyln is the only semi good one|`|pZ4VxGrtaa	Tyler sounds boyish. I know tons of tylers. 99% are boys, i have known some female tylers but they spelt their names "Tylar"<br>  <br>  Amanda - i hate this name. its my sis-in-laws name and i cant stand her. i dont like the name in general tho<br>  <br>  Kaitlynn - love it!<br>  <br>  Amber - i like Amberleigh much better<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think its cute to have mulitples & pick a word that is long enough to fit the number of babies & pick their names from that:<br>  <br>  for example:<br>  <br>  You're having 4 babies so you need an 8letter word.<br>  <br>  "Memories"<br>  [ME]- Madelyn Eve<br>  [MO] Macey Olivia<br>  [RI] Raylin Isabelle<br>  [ES] Eden Skylar<br>  <br>  ..just an example but like i said ive always thought that was a really neat thing to do.

It makes me think of a strong, independent woman.  Amanda is good too, but I don't care much for Kaitlynn (too popular and "cute".  The spelling Kaitlin is better), and Amber.  Not sure why I don't like Amber, it just is not appealing to me, and it is my sister-in-law's name and she is dull and boring.<br>  <br>  Amanda Lynn<br>  Tyler Ann<br>  <br>  Good luck with quads!|`|Iptvlj32aa	I recommend traditional spellings to make your child's life easier, so Caitlin instead of Kaitlynn.  When spelling out to someone, people always trip up over things like the extra "n" at the end.  (I speak from experience!)<br>  <br>  Tyler and Amanda are fine names, but Amber just screams stripper to me.|`|02KmVVvZaa	love them all, <br>  <br>  amber and amander are sort of similar but it gives all the girls there own personality before they are born. it shows them that they dont have to be exactly the same all the time.... <br>  <br>  good luck|`|DNdpV3Myaa	I like Kaitlyn and Amber, hate Tyler and Amanda.

p1sB578jaa	did he ever belittle you or make you feel inferior? did he ever embarrass or treat you as if you were without feeling? a man should always treat you with courtesy and respect. this should be returned. there should never be a lesser person in a relationship. you should always be equals. i hope this helps.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	degrading commets to your charachter, like the way you dress, the wasy you look, your weight, your attitude, your friends....also being controlling, like telling you what to do, what to wear, how to do everything. I was in an emotionally and mentally abusive relationship. It started small so I thought it was just because he cared about me, then it went to, don't talk to so and so, dont wear that, you need to go to the gym, stuff like that.

DUxUndv8aa	Yes those are very nice names, and all very common for the years you were born. The spelling of your name is more unique than any of the others.

lHDff8Braa	If this was my kid she would be grounded until the cat dies from natural causes.  And I would put her in therapy.  Kids who abuse animals often go on to abuse people laterl.<br>  <br>  Those "friends" would never be welcomed in my house again.  And I would provide their parents with this video so they can see what a poor job of parenting they've done.<br>  <br>  I'd also provide a copy of this video to the local ASPCA and let them decide if charges should be filed.<br>  <br>  This is sick.  Yeah, you should confront her.|`|AA11053540	You can always talk to her about "general circumstances", about morals and values and customs, etc.<br>  That way, you can tell her how you feel without mentioning the video specifically.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	If that were my kid I'd be rehoming the cat and sending her to boot camp.  That is INEXCUSABLE.  Or maybe volunteering at the humane society with the injured animals that come in and lose limbs because of careless owners, she needs a serious reality check.<br>  <br>  If I knew you personally I would call the police and report you for knowing about this and keeping the cat, honestly.  That is unquestionably animal cruelty, is illegal, and if this is how your family is going to treat your pets you should not have any.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Talk to her.<br>  Tell her she's disgusting.<br>  Maybe hold her over a building to see if she shakes in fear.<br>  <br>  Something like that.|`|Fk9RN6taaa	Okay, first your son wants to date her, now she's your daughter?|`|nkZdtXXhaa	Just leave her alone.<br>  Seriously.<br>  She probably just did it for the lulz.|`|g52eSE06aa	That video took ages and was weird. I think her internet access privileges should be taken away for at least 3 months and that bf should not be around. She should also apologise to this Brittany Zerwilliger person and maybe compensate for what she did. She should give 90% of her money to an animal charity and maybe do some volunteering. You need to talk to your daughter about this. Cats always land on their feet so I suppose it wasn't hurt but she should still be punished for her act of pure stupidity.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	that's terrible!!! I can't believe that your daughter would let them do that! I would tell her that you found her video and you think it is very unacceptable to be cruel to animals. I would make her do community service/volunteer at an animal shelter, walking dogs or something. At least the one boy felt some remorse and saying he was to scared and he didn't want to do it. Apparently she was home alone...maybe her freedom needs to be cut back some. Whatever punishment you decide you have to stick it out till the end.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	Your daughter and her friends are idiots.  Who cares if she knows you were snooping.  Tell her someone you know so the video and sent the link for it to you.  I wonder how these little brats would feel if they were dropped off a balcony.  Of course, it would have to be a higher balcony to make up for the height and size difference of them and the cat.    30 feet should be high enough.  I know they are more than 6 times the size of the cat, but that's alright.  Oh gee, I hope they don't miss the couch, what a shame that would be.  Wouldn't want to damage what is left of their pea-sized little brains.|`|DWYELEQIaa	you should tell her that you saw it, and that it is funny, 'cus it is. You should probably lighten up, i'm sure your daughter didn't want to harm the cat, they did throw it on a couch, and cats are very good about making long jumps like that. You should just be glad that you didn't unearth a video of your daughter doing something serious, like say being **** faced sucking some guy off.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	OMG ! that is horrible , and the boy really didnt want to do it but she was eggin him on , you need to have a long talk with her! that is horrible , and that poor cat!|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	Throw her off the balcony and see if she lands on her feet.<br>  <br>  I know she is your daughter but she is also an animal abuser and I have no patience for them.|`|M2yERqNSaa	i think youve done a horrible job raising your kid if this is really your kid at all but youre probably a troll|`|iwUInpC1aa	Chuck her (and HIM) off the balcony and see how they like it!|`|vHKptRhyaa	LOL.

Again, isn't that what all parents are supposed to do?<br>  <br>  Enough with the bashing of parenting styles. Agreed!|`|z5EDtgtyaa	cheers to you hun. I really wish it could be that way. and I admit I am guilty of doing it from time to time and I have to remind my self her child not mine, how I raise my daughter isn't how she has to raise her children.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	If only one person listens to this I'll be one happy woman.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	CHEERS!!!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	ill toast to that with my cuppa lol|`|FLpMShKNaa	Oh, I am so with you. I am esp. tired of the formula v. breastfeeding, CIO v. cosleeping debates that are on here every day, not to mention some of the cruel barbs directed at working moms. I think for some maybe it makes them feel better about themselves to out someone else down. yes every child is different and like you I think that most moms love their children as much as we do and make decisions based on the needs of their individual child. Also I have learned that your feelings about a subject such as sleep, feeding, whatever may change with time and experience.<br>  Enough with the competitive momming!|`|p1sB578jaa	wow! they do get rational ppl on here. love it. couldn't agree more.
AA10833602	Ask them early!!!<br>  I'm 17 too and always have this problem and the main reason i usually can't go is because i ask my parents way too late and they always use that as an excuse.<br>  <br>  Ask your parents to have trust in you, but if you do that then don't do anything stupid at the party or else the rest of your life as a 17 year old will be hell.....personal experience my friend!!<br>  <br>  Play it cool!! XD|`|dzyJw0cvaa	In my opinion, you wouldnt be quite responsible by going to a party with sex, drinking and drugs. Thats all the right mix for a bad situation, not to mention ILLEGAL.  you could end up in a very bad scenario, maybe even busted by the police or lets go worse case scenario: you drink and end up pregnant.  Life would be changed forever.<br>  <br>  If you were my daughter i wouldnt let you go no matter how responsible you say you are.  There is a reason drugs are illegal and alcohol has an age limit on it.  because it is dangerous and can cause lots of problems.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, this is just me as a mom speaking.  i know what its like to be a teenager and think the world is a play mat and i am invincible.  (I wasnt a teen all that long ago either.)  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should think about this a little harder and try to figure out if this is a place you really want to be.  You say you are responsible...is this what responsible people do? No.  Not even responsible ADULTS go to parties like this.  Drugs are for idiots.  underage drinking is for idiots.  And sex is for people who are mature and ready...not for parties.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope i helped, though i have a feeling this is not at all what you wanted to hear.|`|egqveuPjaa	Firstly, even if you are 'half-Irish', please don't think you have to right to celebrate Padraig's Day okay?<br>  Just tell them that your friends are going! Do you usually get to go to party's? Have you ever got in serious trouble before? If you are into partying, and are as responsible as you think then it shouldn't be any problem.<br>  If the party's the 14th I would ask about 2 weeks before 'Oh, my friend is having a party in a few weeks, x. y and z are going, so is it okay if I go?'|`|hlWdFTcjaa	Ask them now, tell them who is going with you and tell them the address of the party. By being willing to give them this info they will know that they can trust you. Also promise to text or call them when you get there and later on (before you get drunk obviously) so they know you are okay. Hope this helps!|`|RYZ8CVZTaa	u shouldn't go because whatever happens when u drink and don't remember anything, it's going 2 be trouble!!! ur parents won't agree.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Your old enough, to be honest. So just say 'Mum, l'm going out [next week, for example], l will ring you every 2 hours, or so'<br>  <br>  Something like that. Be careful, though.|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	The odds of going is slim when it comes to knowledge of sex, drugs and alcohol present. (If you are in US and drinking age is 21, that is also illegal).<br>  <br>  But, all you can do is discuss it with them and to have your evidence to support you in being a responsible person. <br>  <br>  Now because you don't give into peer pressure and your friends are there doesn't make the environment safe.<br>  <br>  Have to think of the nut cases out there who can easily turn a party into a place you wish you never went. So, have to look at it from your parent's perspective too.|`|IgEYfBPJaa	Ask now, so if they do say no then you can have time to persuade them. just be like theres a party celebrating St. Patricks day , i said i would go, its nothing big and all my friends are going, is this ok? just be casual about it :)|`|dEb85e07aa	well ask them ahead of time so in case they say no you will keep asking until they say yes.<br>  and tell them to let you go and that this can be a way to see if they trust you.|`|6nElnyzEaa	They should trust you if you are "quite responsible" and just tell them that you'll leave right away(if you want) if anything goes wrong or something totally terrible happens. Have fun if you go!|`|Qe6odyeOaa	Frankly, a 'quite responsible' person does not drink underage, so that kind of trashes your case....|`|jqXV8y3Laa	tell them that there wont be drugs or drinking or any of that<br>  i mena its lying but since your not going to do it then technically<br>  its not reallly lying so yeah

3dxwK9v3aa	I think it all has to do with how fast the dilation is happening. Contractions that are spaced apart do not hurt as bad as the ones right on top of each other. Pain tolerance also differs from person to person. I, myself, am a whimp! LOL!|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I'm not sure.  When people ask about my labors I can honestly say I didn't feel contractions until 4-5 cm dilated.  It was more a rhythmic tightening of my stomach.  Don't get me wrong though, when I progressed, which was FAST, it started to hurt a lot!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Good question! I don't know either. I don't know if I'm dilated or not.

WPI0Z47saa	I had unprotected sex with my husband since we were 16 (I am not condoning this) and we didn't get pregnant until we were 25. I am 28 and pregnant with my second. So it doesn't necessarily mean that you are infertile you may just be lucking out.  My friend thought she was infertile for never getting pregnat since she started having sex when she was 13 and didn't get pregnant until she was 24. Just be careful because you may fool yourself into believing that it can't happen to you and you may end up a young mother. Make sure you are ready to have a baby before playing that game.|`|5WYeHh0paa	When I was 16 I was engaged to a man and we tried to have a bby for about 2 years. I had uprotected sex with several diffrent guys after that relationship failed, ( i was not as ready as i thought i was) and never got pregnant. When I was 17 going on 18 I met my husband and after 3 months of having unprotected sex because I thought I was infertile, I became pregnant. I really think that was God's way of protecting me and making sure I had a bby with the right man. After we found out I was pregnant, he proposed and now we are happily married and cant wait for baby. Believe me if it dosent happen its for a reason.

It will make your life so much richer if you finish high school and go to a community college, or a vocational school and have the true ability to financially support yourself (with or without a boyfriend) before you decide to be a mommy. I am not against young mothers, but a bit of planning on your part will make your life, and your future childs life stable and fullfilling. Young mothers often find themselves in a struggle, don't discount the work raising a child is at the age of 17.<br>  <br>  Do you have health care?<br>  Do you have a good steady income?<br>  Do you have the money and resources for daycare, or to be a stay at home mom?<br>  Do you have permanent, safe housing?<br>  Do you live near decent public schools?<br>  Do you have enough to save money for retirement and college for your child?<br>  Do you want your baby to have a better life than you did?|`|WIEPISyeaa	Do you have regular periods?  If you don't have regular periods then you aren't ovulating (at least not on a regular basis) and if you aren't ovulating then you can't get pregnant.  It could just be taking awhile, or you aren't having sex at the right time of the month (most women ovulate around 2 weeks after the first day of their last period.)  You only have a short window to fertilize the egg (usually only about 36 hours) so chances are if your periods are regular, you just aren't having sex on the right days.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!  And don't worry....we're not here to judge you.  If you are ready for a baby that is your choice.  :)|`|dlOFWcU4aa	Just because I woman starts to have a period in puberty does not mean that her body is ready to carry a baby.  It can take years to fully mature in order to carry a healthy baby and for a mother to remain healthy too.

I enjoyed being at home with my partner.<br>  <br>   Also I know you said your in a steady relationship...how steady is this relationship. Do you live together.? Because there is one thing that will test a realtionship and that is living together. if you can live together than you will be a good family to bring a child into. because it shows that you can commit.<br>  <br>  Im not trying to persude you not to do it...because I have the most respect for young mothers who try their best for their children. Im just saying to make sure this is definitly what you want out of life...<br>  <br>  if it is what you want... Than I wish you best of luck and i would suggest you work out your fertile says. (ovulation days) and make sure you have sex on those days. xxxxxx
Yn6pM2Xyaa	my daughter was very similar.. she was fine and dandy as long as she got to wander around nekkid or at least bottomless... which for us was fine because we trained in the summer months and spent a lot of time in the wading pool or yard.. but its winter still and so at some point your little boy needs pants!  Again with a girl its a little easier because of dresses..   but try slowly moving him from nothing on the bottom to just underwear to finally pants that are elastic waisted and possibly slightly loose.  For the first 2 months or so after dd was trained (right after 2nd birthday) she just really couldn't figure out how to successfully pull up or down pants and undies..  so she would tell me she had to go and we would run to the bathroom together, i'd pull them down, wipe bum and pull pants back up.. slowly she learned how to pull down things and eventually up as well.. after about 4 months she was pretty much independant.  As for toilet seats we had one folding seat that we took to public washrooms, then another permanent seat added on her bathroom toilet and then at her grandparents she uses  a one piece potty.  She has been taught after much fighting how to sit on a regular seat after the portable one broke and she needed to go badly.  She would scream and yell about it but after a few times she realized it was a better option than holding for forever while mummy finished her food shopping or whatever.  Daughter had a few accidents after the for 2-3 weeks of initial training.. one in the corner of a clothing store!  another time she did it twice in a row while at a museum!  always carry around an extra set of pants, and a pull up for 'just in cases' and also if you will be somewhere where there is no bathroom.  get some flushable wet wipes for their #2's because they never wipe properly and personally I went with pull upover night for about 4-5 months until dd was consistently dry overnight - she was INITIALLY dry for 2 weeks after first being trained but then reverted back to peeing at night.. tried to wake her once or twice overnight to help with problem but it still didn't help so went back to pull ups and about 4 months later she started to always be dry and then after doing that for like a month I finally gave in a went pull up free at night and we're doing okay so far *knock on wood*  Best of luck - being diaper free is hard work but oh so rewarding!|`|MvC6n3DWaa	First of all, keep in mind you just started. Nine days is nothing. Secondly, it is common to remove pants when potty training. They do not like the idea of the poo or pee going down their legs or leaving a trail. When wearing clothing, it is contained and similar to how it felt with a diaper. <br>  <br>  Here is the deal. You need to take him to the potty every 30-60 minutes in the beginning. He may not be aware of the signals and this takes time. He is developing a new habit and that wil take a couple of months, especially if there is a distraction. Initially it was new and exciting, so he was more aware. Now he has been doing it and is thinking about other things. You need to remind him without punishing him. <br>  <br>  At night, do not expect to place him bed without a pull up for about a year. It may be longer. Depends on the child. Some kids wet the bed for years as it is developmentally connected, do not be alarmed. <br>  <br>  The fact that he started so well is something to celebrate. Everytime he does well, place a sticker on a chart. Once he acquires so many stickers, maybe 10, give him a prize. Do not be overly generous as you will open up a can of worms, but a little something. The dollar store can help you there. <br>  <br>  Relax, it is not easy. If it were, there would not be so much talk about it!
yYGc1FNAaa	wow that is crazy<br>  <br>  -kathy|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I've always eaten my regular foods and only rarely has my son had problems with my diet.

But I have a friend who can't eat beans or her daughter won't let her sleep at night.  I eat beans all the time and my son never has a problem.  Each baby is different.

Babies CAN be bothered by just about anything, so IF you notice that baby seems fussy after you eat a particular food, try avoiding that food and see if it helps.

It is generally recommended that a nursing mother eat whatever she likes, whenever she likes, in the amounts that she likes and continue to do this unless baby has an obvious reaction to a particular food. <br>  It's suggested that everyone, particularly pregnant and nursing mothers, avoid eating certain types of fish that are typically high in mercury. <br>  It is a good idea to restrict caffeine and alcohol to a certain extent, but it is rarely necessary to eliminate them. <br>  Some food proteins (such as cow's milk protein or peanut protein) do pass into mother's milk. If there is a history of food allergies in your family, you may wish to limit or eliminate the allergens common in your family. <br>  Any baby might react to a particular food (although this is not very common). If baby has an obvious reaction every time you eat a certain food, it may be helpful to eliminate that food from your diet. For more information, see Dairy and other Food Sensitivities in Breastfed Babies. <br>    <br>  <br>  Making women think that they must maintain ‘perfect’ diets in order to have thriving breastfed babies is an unnecessary obstacle to breastfeeding. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  I avoided too much caffeine in the first two months, because that would make her fussy. Other than that I can't think of a single food she reacted to. It's all about the individual baby. If you eat something and the baby goes beserk ;-) you simply avoid that food. Otherwise eat what you want! You don't even have to avoid alcohol and most medications are fine- don't not bf because of myths.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I have been eating spicy Thai food a couple of times a week since my son was 4 weeks old and I returned to work. (It's close by and fast so I can still breastfeed on my lunch break) He doesn't seem to react to it at all. I did notice early on that he would get really gassy and fussy after I ate beans though. I thought it was a fluke but it happened consistently. He is much better now (5 mos old) and will just toot a little bit extra if I eat a lot of beans. Other than that I eat whatever I want. I tried eliminating anything that could potentially cause a problem when he was a few days old because he was colicy, but it made no difference and after he was happier I added things back with no problem. So all in all, I think you can mostly eat what you want.|`|8U4NMYOvaa	when i was breastfeeding my son i had the worst craving for nachos..the spicy kind and man it was the worst thing in the world that i could have eaten because my son must have had the worst tummy ache for hours. he was so fussy and his poor belly was hard. i felt so bad, you can guarantee that i never did that again..lol|`|1G3XPiq3aa	I have a history of food allergies in my family, so paid close attention to any small reactions she may have had, but nothing I ate seemed to have any effect, and I ate a fairly wide variety of foods.<br>  <br>  Eat what you like, and just be observant of any changes.|`|J9QUjetqaa	Actually very little has affected my baby. I think it upset her tummy when I ate broccoli so I haven't eaten it since.<br>  Hot sauce definitely made a huge difference. For a few days there she was crying a lot and staying up all night. I had hot sauce on food every one of those days and once I cut it out, no more fussiness. <br>  Avoid hot sauce!|`|1CEApjyRaa	I eat almost anything I want the only thing I found to cause a problem for him is if I eat anything with garlic in it. Don't be frustrated, you'll learn as you go along.|`|d16618e477b055ddab0779b019bb96fdaa	My baby has only ever gotten a upset tummy from me drinking orange juice. Other than that I eat anything.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	eat beans all you like.  What made my baby fussy was when I drank milk, he had a milk allergy.|`|2CG4wN4faa	Honestly, it all depends on your baby.  That's why there are so many foods that they list to stay away from.  Really you just have to do things the trial and error way.  If you find your baby abnormally fussy after you just had Garlic Alfredo for dinner chances are he's sensitive to garlic etc.  Most babies are fine with whatever foods their mother eats and actually enjoy the different taste in breast milk, as odd as that sounds.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I looked into foods that might make my baby fussy as well.  I can't imagine living off of what I could eat!  In the end I was willing to put up with a little fussiness rather than try and figure out what might be causing it.  My theory is that any foods that you would eat normally shouldn't cause much of a problem.  After all, people that live in mexico/italy/thailand etc. also have babies and they don't eliminate everything that's spicy etc. from their diets!|`|ia7lyDuFaa	I eat whatever I like and have no problems with my son having gas.  Personally, I think it is an old wive's tale that spicy food makes your baby have gas.  I BF'd my daughter for 2 years and now my son for 8 months and still going strong...I have never restricted my diet while breastfeeding other than trying to avoid caffeine.<br>  <br>  Think about it, if spicy food really did upset babies tummy while breastfeeding, how would moms in countries like India and Mexico ever be able to BF when spicy food is the norm?
Rhr1umV1aa	Just because she is sleeping and eating a lot does not mean that she is pregnant. I believe it also means that she could be low on iron. I would tell her to take a test. If it was Feb 5th the HCG hormone would show up now. Good luck!|`|BzCYQlcuaa	ok first RELAX! yes sleeping a lot was the first thing i notice when i found out i was pregnant!  but she may not be pregnant. when your period is coming the symptoms are very similar to pregnancy symptoms this is very easy to mistake a period and pregnancy. i would wait 2 weeks and take a home test. or just have her go get a blood test at the doctors. but if she is all stressed out and she is not pregnant .. stress can delay her period even more. so taking a test is the only way to solve this problem<br>  <br>  and if she was pregnant .. you might not be ready but everything happens for a reason.|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	first off - calm down!  And remember ... of all of the days of the month she can only get pregnant about 2 of them!  Next it was her first time .. so of course she is nervous and thinking that.  I did after my first time!  Also, statistics show that of all the women who "think" they are pregnant ... only about 10% really are .. the rest are false alarms.  With that said here is what she needs to look for - a late period, very sore and/ or tender boobs and nipples ... they will be very tender!  Increased nausea, strong sense of smell ... all of these are signs ... but they can also be signs of an upcoming period.  Her best bet would be to go to the dollar store and buy about $5 worth of pregnancy tests and take them at home.  If she gets a negative she should re-test in 7 days ... unless she gets her period (then there's no reason to re-test)!  Good luck ... dont worry you will be fine :)|`|9EMR6BHFaa	You won't know until she is due for her period in a few weeks.  If she doesn't get it, then take a test.  Even if she was, it is too soon to have the symptoms she is describing (especially the increase in appetite).  She probably is not, but you will have to wait and see.  Let this be your wake up call to NEVER have unprotected sex again.|`|hZWup7xXaa	you can take her to the doctor or get her a home pregnancy test, its not to early to test, do you know when her last period was? she could just have a change in hormones that's causing this. get a test that is for up to 5 or 6 days before the expected period. this will tell if she is or not.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	eating and sleeping could be anything, a home test would be accurate now so take a test and next time use protection!|`|KGRikkJeaa	take a pregnancy test duh!|`|x8rYunYeaa	uhm no that doesnt mean she is pregnant. you dont start eating a lot or getting those cravings until a little later in your pregnancy. and being tired isn't really a factor either. when its your first time your body likes to fool you and make you think that you're pregnant. so the symtoms could be all in her head. and she's freaking out because it was her first time. this happens to so many people. i was one of them too. just find out when she is supposed to have her period and then wait and see if it comes. also if she's stressing this that could cause her period to be late. so just relax and see what happens|`|9QVjNaIPaa	ok...if she is pregnant right now then she must have slept with someone else before she got with you and that person is the father. if she got pregnant from you it would be too early to tell. make her go to the doc and if she is pregnant, find out how far along she is.|`|aMkWajC7aa	ur not ready to  become a daddy yet, then why u had sex with ur gf without protection....there's a possibility that she s pregnant now jst wait after a month and u will find out....hmmmmmp...be a man if she is really pregnant....TANGA!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Eating and sleeping could be signs of many things.  Have her take a test or call her dr for some blood work to confirm.|`|be68e6d198f3f9ac69efb2146c8d907eaa	She would not be able to tell yet if she is pregnant, just calm down because her chances of being pregnant are almost 0!|`|la1KlgJ3aa	You will just have to wait for a missed period and a preg. test to tell.|`|eYmIlVnGaa	tell her to go to any pharmacy and get a pregnancy test, the seven dollars will be worth your peace of mind. If she is pregnant, then she has 2 choices, raise the kid or get an abortion. You as the father should support whatever she decides to do. Unprotected sex almost always ends in pregnancy, sorry. But also wait for more signs than just eating and sleeping a lot.|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	It's too early to tell. It usually takes a good 4 weeks from the "act" to know.|`|AA10759365	Go to the dollar store and buy a pregnancy test!
hjLzSGV0aa	i like the chloe one but the others not really|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I only like Chloe Scarlett and Greysen Shane|`|QWTLw9DEaa	Um...<br>  I don't what to think except: My brain is overwhelmed by the horrible combinations for first names and the terrible misspellings.<br>  <br>  AnnaMakenzi Pyper - I have so much to say about this name, so I'll condense it. Mackenzie, spelled correctly, is a boy's name. AnnaMakenzi is not even a name! It's two names, one spelled trashy, mashed together! Piper, a bad enough name as is, is worse spelled with a Y!<br>  <br>  Chloe Scarlett - This is gorgeous. Although I prefer Scarlett to Chloe, because Chloe sounds like it wouldn't age well<br>  <br>  CharleighAnn Grace - Good God... Again, I'll condense my rant. First off, Charlie, spelled incorrectly once again, is a boy's name. CharleighAnn is not a name! It's two names mashed together to make one horrid and trashy name. Grace is gorgeous, do not ruin it with CharleighAnn. Perhaps Charlotte Grace? Look! A decent, feminine, non-trashy girl's name.<br>  <br>  Greyson Shane - I do not care for Greyson nor Shane, but I'll say, your boy's names are 100 times better than your girl's names<br>  <br>  Ian Michael - I don't care for Ian, I love Michael<br>  <br>  Ian Charles - Once again, I don't care for Ian, but I love Charles. Michael Charles or Charles Michael would be nice<br>  <br>  please, I'm begging you, change your girls names|`|AA11490722	Charleigh Ann Grace and Anna Makenzi Pyper are really beautiful names for girls I really like them.<br>  <br>  Not such much a fan of your boy names (sorry that's just mine opinion though)- Ian Charles is alright though|`|U1juqahIaa	I love Ian Michael and Ian Charles is ok, but  Greysen is down-market, although I like Shane.  I hate the girls names.|`|6yD5k9Azaa	if you'd spell piper right i'd pick AnnaMakenzi Piper<br>  and Grayson Shane<br>  <br>  ugh crappy spelling|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	These are too wild. Shorten them some. I prefer Chloe Scarlet<br>  <br>  Ian Michael|`|heC9aQ18aa	Hate the way most of these names are spelled. Atrocious spellings, almost all of them make me cringe when I see the spelling. The only ones spelled the correct way are Ian Michael and Ian Charles. For girls only Chloe Scarlett is spelled the right way. I like Scarlett. One of my favorites. What in the heck is AnnaMakenzi. Ugh Horrible.|`|KeRqdX2Vaa	From your list:<br>  Chloe Scarlett and Ian Michael<br>  <br>  I like Chloe Ann, Charleigh Ann, Charleigh Grace, Makenzi Ann, Scarlett Ann, Anna Makenzi...|`|VwaFM0L8aa	Ian is my favorite boy name ever.<br>  AnnaMakenzi is cute also.|`|0OsqCShHaa	i like chloe scarlett and ian michael? beautiful names|`|u4jmt2Scaa	cccccccccccooooooooooooooollllllllllllll...|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	Chloe Scarlett and Greyson Shane|`|tkQq5tR1aa	Sure. why not?|`|QWfkHyUeaa	chloe scarlett<br>  ian micheal<br>  <br>  <br>  (i also like makenzi on it's own )
TJusfEnlaa	I would make up enough boiled water to fill enough bottles for one day and add the formula powder when need be. at night when we got to the hotel i would wash them with hot soapy water and dry them, and boil the kettle and do the same thing again for the next day.<br>  if you really are worried about sterleizing (i only sterelize the bottles about once every 2 weeks these days, my son is 9 months) if the hotel you are staying at has cooking facilities you could boil a pan on the stove and sterelize them that way by boiling for about 5 minutes.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Rinse the bottle out with the hottest water the hotel has, add some soap and water, shake, empty, use your bottle brush and rinse. Bottle is clean.<br>  <br>  To make the bottle just add some tap water, powder, and shake. If you don't like the taste of the water there you could buy some bottled water but then you'd have to heat the bottles. Its up to you.|`|EeGgovyCaa	We would have a few bottles. One for formula and one for juice. <br>  <br>  When we get to the hotel we'd just wash them out with warm water.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	Boil water and put into several bottles. Bring formula in little sachets or divide it into little containers. Then you only have to mix the formula in with the water just before you feed your baby. The water won't go off like an already mixed formula. <br>  <br>  Buy anti-bacterial tablets to use for cleaning the bottles. You can then either clean them on the road or in the hotel. Just need to add some water. If you have a kitchenette in your hotel room then you can boil the bottles using a pot on the stove.|`|AA10753286	first off, i dont think u really need to sterilize anymore, ive had seven children, i did that thing with the first two, after that, i quit, but u do need to keep the bottles very clean, i also think the most important thing is to use good bottled water, dont use tap, in some states or towns ...u just never know. u could just spend the extra money, if u got it, and buy pre-made bottles. that would be more costly, but fewer problems.|`|wUfZJvbUaa	honestly, i'd take some dish soap and a bottle brush with me. I'm sure you'll have running water along the way..; at coffee shops etc. don't worry about sterilizing. as long as you wash them with warm, soapy water, they should be fine. <br>  if you insist on sterilizing, take your sterilizer with you and plug it in once you get to the hotel.<br>  <br>  have fun.|`|SdVrwd6daa	make sure you have a few bottles. just clean the bottles at the hotel and sterilize before you leave home. they dont need to be sterilized all the time.
58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	Two Weeks Pregnant? <br>  <br>  I've heard it all.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should call the Guinness Book for World Records.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Well, since YOU'RE the One who's going to be taking care of the Baby (if you decide to keep it) most of the time- for the next few years- this is going to be mostly YOUR Decision. So sit down with your Daughter, discuss it- & decide what You're going to do... It's YOUR Life- too.  -and Good Luck!|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i expected the thumb down, but if i were you, i will let her have the abortion asap.  She is just too young.|`|UgIOVl1jaa	I think if you want to teach her responsibility & repercussions for her actions then you should let her have the baby but put it up for adoption.  If she's already having sex at such a young age & you get her to have an abortion what's to stop her from doing it again? I'm not in your shoes though & it's easier said then done but I hope you find the right solution for you & your daughter.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	ohh so you're thinking about abortion already?? oh so will that teach her a lesson now? i think you should really give her some support and let her see how tough it is going to b now. i hope she doesn't get an abortion. she did open her legs and as you said, you spoke to her so she knew the kind of consequences their could be! maybe now that you can't really teach her much about closing her legs or doing it safely, you can try to help her with parenting and I bet this time, both of you girls will try not to make the same mistakes. i'm not judging you and i think it's her fault for not listening and being so careless, now she has to face it and be a teenage mom!|`|Coc593Ikaa	When trolling, you should be consistent and get your facts correct.<br>  <br>  1) No woman with a 13-year-old daughter would start a question with OMG!<br>  2) No doctor would tell a girl she is 2 weeks pregnant. Why? Because there is no such thing. At 2 weeks, the girl is just ovulating and is not even pregnant yet. A doctor generally can't diagnos a pregnancy until about 4 weeks along. Don't believe me? Look it up.<br>  <br>  So that is my advice.<br>  <br>  For realsy, to follow the rules, if she is pregnant, get her proper prenatal care and let her make the decision herself.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Let her have the baby first of all, this will teach her a thing or two about sex and its consequences, and then give the baby up for adoption. That way you can can set your heart at ease that your daughter can finish school but the baby didn't have to lose its life because of her mistake. And sometimes parents can't help what their children do because of how society broadcasts sex, especially to younger girls. They get younger every day. If she had sex a few months ago, she'd be farther along so I'm guessing she had sex within the last month. Don't worry about the who right now, worry about that later. Just care for your daughter and try not to let her feel like she is a total disgrace, its best for you and her. She may not want to give up the baby but like you said she's THIRTEEN! She wont be able to do this so early on. I wish you luck!|`|dR2bqUixaa	Abortion is the easy way out of this for her, I think. If I were you I would make her have the child and then if you want you can give it up for an adoption or teach her more responsibility and have her get a job to help take care of the baby. They also have schools these days that she would be able to take the baby with her. Good luck!|`|otFCWMuUaa	2 you cant know your pregnant at two weeks thats usaully when conception occurs obviously your not a mother caz you would understand the process.<br>  <br>  well for you little lady.. just so you know..<br>  <br>  the first day of your period is when the whole cycle begins... about a week n half later you have something called ovulation n when a male sperm reaches your egg it implants the egg.. thus being your second week... you cant know your pregnant till at least your 4th or 5th week.|`|zBz10IiOaa	well i know you must be mad! but be there for her and show her the way to go and for god sakes find out who the father is and if he is not a minor bust his asss|`|gA22md42aa	lol fantasize getting pregnant? Go for it shame yourself!|`|98WKYtfwaa	I agree with too lady to rest.<br>  <br>  - No women would start a question with OMG! or continously use !!!!! after every few sentences. I'm 18 years old and i don't even use that kind of wording. <br>  <br>  - No doctor would tell you that you're 2 weeks pregnant, that's impossible. A doctor goes by the first day of your last period, the earliest you can find out is usually about 4/5weeks into the pregnancy if your HCG levels are even high enough at that point.<br>  <br>  If you've just made a slight error and are really telling the truth then;<br>  A kid will have sex no matter what you teach them, i was taught everything about it and my parents were both very open about it to me, i still went on and had sex. It wasn't my parents fault because they never forced me into it, i done it all by myself simply because everyone has the urge to have sex, it's natural.<br>  <br>  It's not your choice if she's has an abortion or not, you cannot make that decision for her. It's 100% upto her what she wants to do, you should support her and be there for her no matter what decision she chooses.|`|HM0cxcahaa	I think honestly the trauma of an abortion is less than the trauma of her handing over her child and the years of wondering that come with adoption. Yes there are plenty of couples out there wanting to adopt however that is a massive emotional and mentally traumatising thing that she could regret the rest of her life, the abortion on the other hand is less mentally stressful as she has not had to look the baby in the face and she will be under anaesthetic and wake up with what looks like a period.<br>  She has her whole life ahead of her, its a really important decision|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	If you allow her to have an abortion what are you teaching her? Not a thing! All she gonna do is go out and do it again! Kids need supervising 24/7 if they arnt getting it and allowed to go do whatever they want stuff like this happens. She needs to have the baby regardless of the fact that she's too young. Let her take RESPONSIBILITY for her actions!!If you dont she will learn nuthing! If push comes to shove give the baby up for adoption! But do not allow her to have an abortion!!! It could mess her up physically and mentally! Then when she gets older and is ready to have kids she may not be able to!<br>  <br>    And just for the record NO BODY IS EVER 2 WEEKS PREGNANT STARTS AND 4 AND SO ON GET IT TOGETHER|`|OL2Xjh5vaa	I would say to have her go through all of the pregnancy. If you are sure you can't keep the baby once it is born you should put it up for adoption. If you really want to teach her keep the baby once it is born for at least a week. It may keep her from having sex again. I am sure you are a great mother just try not to treat her like she is a terrible child.|`|3q2Uo6Whaa	there is no such thing as a doctor telling you that you are "2 weeks" pregnant.|`|AA11307821	I've known in my life three girls this age that got pregnant. One had an abortion and seems fine many years later and is married with three kids. The other left school for pregnancy and adopted the child. This was very traumatic for the mother but she was very responsible for the years I knew her later.(I don't know if she has contact w/ the child now- 20 years later) The third i know kept the baby. She is now not even thirty and she is a grandma.<br>  <br>  Not sure that any of this has anything to do with your situation, but maybe I would try to find as many people as you can and ask how this situation has affected their child's lives etc. Look at all your options, maybe talk to a therapist and decide what is best for your family. Good luck!|`|VD2zSe4iaa	an abortion at any age is extremely hard mentally. I had one at 16 and it took me 6 yrs to deal with it. there is always adoption. if you don't want to give it up to someone else you could adopt the baby. <br>  regardless of how you try to protect your kids, thats it.. they are just kids and will find a way to do what they want with or without your permission. don't beat yourself up. <br>  from my experience my mother and i got a lot closer. i couldn't go anywhere without her knowing. she's my best friend now. <br>  as heart wrenching as it is whats done is done and talk to her. let her know that you're there for her. she needs you.|`|bzQNHfunaa	ok, i will not judge u. i got preg @ 16 w/ my 1st and my parents we're good solid christians. dnt take this on urself mom. she made a choice 2 have sex. it had nothing 2 do w/ the way u "raised" her! also plz dont make her have an abortion! shes probably just as scared as u are and doesnt need the stress now thats she's carrying a baby inside her. explain 2 her that what she did was right but that there are now consequences. personally if it we're me id tell my daughter she has 2 options. one she can keep the baby and grown up w/out a childhood or 2 she can adopt and learn from her so called "mistake"(just know god doesnt make mistakes ppl do!) i really hope things wk out 4 the 2 of u and please be there 4 her no matter what! my aparents were and it made it alot better!

If you don't want to buy one from a store you can check your local listings for free, confidential pregnancy test centers in your area.  I would suggest not having unprotected sex again.  If your period is already irregular that could be what's causing it's lateness, otherwise it could be late due to stress.  But, get a test to know for sure.|`|kY29gYhjaa	get a test, its the only way u will know for sure!|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	With my first I waited until I was 2 weeks late. I sometimes have irregular periods, too. At least by that point you know something is up. Otherwise, go ahead and take a preggo test from the store. That will tell you very quickly.|`|7xit1ogxaa	If your period is irregular, how do you know it is late? The reason it is called an irregular period is because you do not have a set cycle. Any pregnancy test will tell you if you are pregnant or not.|`|6357742b6cd4c47787c0e7cca6fc6389aa	ok, first things first..

You either did or you didn't...that's kind of like saying "I'm a little bit pregnant"...in your case it seems like you might be a lot of bit pregnant. If you can not afford a pregnancy test and are afraid to go to your Doctor - or talk to your parents, then: Contact Planned Parenthood - they can help you! And if by the grace of God, you find that you have dodged the bullet - they can also help you get birth control & condoms! As an FYI - pre ejaculate (the little bit of sperm that seeps out "unnoticed") has a higher concentration of sperm in it that a full-ejaculate. The full-ejaculate just shoots the sperm closer to the target (so they don't have to swim as far). The only way to prevent pregnacy is to stay away from sperm - not: Pull out!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	You should take a home pregnancy test.|`|IZTmipyaaa	you kinda had unprotected sex?<br>  <br>  take an hpt|`|G7oAaXnUaa	its called a pregnancy test|`|F4rCjV1haa	use a TEST!!!!|`|VEkkn2Otaa	take a test duhhhh!
Pf9fyEyQaa	Unfortunately there is no way to tell!  I know how disappointing that sounds...believe me I'm with you! <br>  <br>  At 36 weeks I was 1cm dilated, cervix was soft and thinned to 2cm, head is engaged...I am now 38 weeks and 2 days and still pregnant!  But I don't really mind because I know it will happen when he is ready and it's still early on.  I'm getting a membrane sweep done tomorrow at the doctors so we'll see how that goes! <br>  <br>  Good luck with the pressure and cramping, I've had that for a couple weeks now too!  I hope it means labour for you!  For me I guess it's just my body getting ready!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Could be baby getting into position for his big entrance. Do some squat exercises to progress your dilation (if you're ready?) Suggested to me by an RN when you want to try dilating more.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	My baby was about 3 weeks overdue, but that's about how I felt when I was starting to go into labor. Actually, for the most part, that's almost how my labor felt the entire time! The contractions weren't bad at all, and mostly felt like strong menstrual cramps, and eventually just got irritating more than anything else. I had back labor, at least I think that's what the doctor called it, and my lower back and hips were achy for a while before I actually went into labor, and then all hell broke loose and my lower back hurt sooooo bad! That was the only bad part! Also, like you, I felt a lot of pressure where the baby's head had come down and started pushing to get ready. Sounds like you may be there!!! Congrats and good luck!!!|`|2ibfQbLcaa	When i went into labor at 36 weeks It felt like a bad stomache ache, followed by minor cramps, I just felt the need to make sure everything was alright, and i got to the hosp and was 4 cm dialated already.. so at 37 weeks your baby will be fine, and you may want to just go get checked.|`|kwkOaDDlaa	Yep could well be.......or it could be Braxton Hicks contractions (the practise ones) When I had my first child, I was dilated 1cm like you & had these pains for two whole days!!!! Man that was tuff. You will know for sure when things kick off........try & bring on more contractions by walking around, staying upright, swaying to music. You could also try a hot chilli....I did, it worked!!!   GOOD LUCK & make sure you let us know.....oooooh how exciting. xxxxx|`|PtH1YPA9aa	i was in slow labor for like 4 weeks. I was 2 cm dialated for 3 weeks and having insane but random contractions for over 4 weeks. i ended up getting induced a week after my due date. In other words, you never know. Congrats and good luck|`|9c2FSHX8aa	Yes, these are some signs. Have you had a bloody show yet, or lost your mucous plug? If not, you may still have days, even a couple of weeks.
8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	Everyone's different.  When I was 2 months pregnant with my son, I was starting to show already & couldn't button my pants.  I didn't really feel any firmness at that point, but I was noticeably bigger.  I knew a couple women that didn't have firmness or start showing until they were about 5 months pregnant.  It depends on how your uterus is positioned.  Congratulations!|`|AA10953561	It may feel a little hard, but that's not from your uterus. Your uterus won't pop up high enough to be felt from the outside for another couple weeks. What you're probably feeling is bloating. All those wonderful pregnancy hormones cause women to bloat and their clothes suddenly start feeling a lot tighter.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|52U22fiAaa	your belly won't get harder for a while, and it also depends on your shape, frame, weight, etc.|`|QYSsvqXyaa	I'm 8 weeks and notice a slight change in how much my tummy sticks out but you'd never know unless you were obsessing like me. Gas is probably what it is but still it looks bigger maybe not harder but sticks out more in t's.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	I'm at the same stage. It's not possible but my lower abdomen is firmer at night. By morning its back to normal.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Not yet.  Around 12-13 weeks is when your uterus grows above your pubic bone.|`|6C4ibyF8aa	no, it's way to early|`|CkkPaP8vaa	This is not a silly question everyone is different.  Yes you can begin to feel your stomach getting harder but no it is most likely not the baby yet, but the buy products of being pregnant.  Your cervix is tightening but that is lower than your belly.  Even if you don’t feel gassy or bloated guess what … you would be surprised how much hormones can not only make your body feel different but make your mind do tricks to.  But if you feel your belly getting harder that’s ok and nothing to worry about just a reminder of that something is in there growing.  Even if it is caused by them darn hormones and nothing else.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	It's different for everyone.  My stomach wasn't hard yet at 9-10 weeks though.  Baby is just a little peanut in there right now!  It starts to get harder in a few more weeks, closer to 20 weeks or so I would think.   But like I said, it's all different for everyone.|`|ZepyVdWaaa	I'm 9 weeks, and I've only had a little swelling. My doctor said that showing doesn't start until the second trimester (13wks.)..|`|yrF1q1mdaa	no, mine didn't really start getting hard until about 16 weeks|`|QAptQNMOaa	You should feel some firmness in your lower abdomon, though nothing too firm.
ULo8Cwdfaa	It doesn't always mean she is pregnant. get her a test. and It could be late because she is irregular or stressed out or anything. <br>  <br>  good luck. and don't stress. get a test for her.|`|52U22fiAaa	yeah maybe.
p8HOUxNVaa	the chances don't sound great for pregnancy but there is a chance. She could skip her period because of stress, malnutrition, ect. or she could skip it for no good reason it happens.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	Probably not but theres a slight chance. Did you pre at all? if you did then she could be. and also she could be late.
gieEWY1Qaa	If you had a miscarriage and you just took a test and are currently bleeding from it. Then the hormones would still be in your body and you wouldve gotten a positive. But there is no way of knowing for sure unless you go to the doctors.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	first off you should really stop having "pretty frequent sex with your boyfriend" if you can't even tell your parents about it.  You are very young according to your own statement and obviously not ready to have a child.  If you missed it in Sex Ed, sex is actually how you have children.  Yes, it's sounds like a miscarriage, or that something is wrong in your female "plumbing".  I suggest that you find a gynecologist anyhow, if not for a pregnancy, just to make sure everything is okay in you.  A 22 day period is not normal,|`|kSjHLJI8aa	you should go to the doctor anyway hon. you've most likely miscarried bkuz its pretty painful cramping. the doc will have to check you out to make sure everythings passed.
Na1HDNncaa	he's hurt and maybe is embarrased..i mean think about it, what normal guy is happy to get dumped by his girlfreind? i say just give him some time, dont suffocate him. but if you want to get the messagee through that you want to talk to him hint to his friends about it (dnt tell! just hint) he'll come around... in the mean time all i can say is to think about the reasons why you broke up w/ him and think about it and if going back with him is what you really want..i mean if you guys go back aout and the reason you broke up w/ him was bcuz u barely got to see him, and you barely talked, then how are you going to change that? no point in going back if later on you'll feel the same way...|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	You know you are too young when you break up on an impulse over text message. And on that note, it's just a little phase... you will get over it. I am sure you feel bad now, but think about it the way you thought when writing that text. It's not working out. I am guessing you guys are really young and have much to learn. <br>  <br>  I think you should talk to him, just so he doesn't hold a grudge or feel really terrible. But talk to him about how it wasn't working out and you had to do it. Say sorry that you did it over a text. <br>  At this point, spend time with really close friends and do girl stuff!!! You will love it!. <br>  All the best.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	You really hurt his feelings, and the reason why he hasn't been responding to your messages is probably because he's still trying to face the fact that you two are no longer together.<br>  <br>  When he's ready, he'll talk to you again.<br>  <br>  Just give him some time.|`|ba7a9d89b85e1c8a26e92c2727576399aa	breakin up is always hard to do. give him some time to think things through. maybe he just needs some space. <br>  <br>  want anymore help just email me :)|`|kwMuRDFjaa	He's hurt, give it some time. If he's ready, he'll talk to you again.|`|Mjni0Np3aa	you hurt him, he doesn't want to date you anymore. you should just move on.|`|I2poVPY2aa	listen, if he breaks up with you thorugh a text, you know thats corney. if he is stupid enough to walk away then you have to be smart enough to let him go!|`|0C8lOe6Faa	HE IS JUST HURT GIVE HIM TIME MAYBE HE WILL GET OVER IT AND BY THE WAY MY 5 MONTH ANNIVERSARY IS ON THE 27TH ALL WELL AND ITS MY DADS B-DAY|`|876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	It could be that you feel bad on how you broke it off with him...ive had those feelings for a person before...but i figured out that it was only because i felt bad about me breaking it off...and how i did it...was this your first boyfriend or the first that you actually really liked a lot???  that could be the reason for your feelings...i'll tell you what my friend told me...if you can only think of negative things when thinking about him then you shouldn't be with him<br>  <br>  if he doesn't text you back...he either has found someone else already, needs some space before talking to you again, or just doesn't want to talk to you any more...give it time and you'll either find someone better...or if it's meant to be then he'll speak to you again and you'll get back together...keep yourself busy and try not to think about it|`|Cl9m4aSpaa	I remember those days lol. You'll get over it trust me. 7 years from now u won't even care. Just move on and let it go. Live ya life,its only been 2 months. Missing a bf always happens and is normal but it only last a couple weeks and then u end up liking someone new and going thru it all over again. And the reason he probably isn't responding to you is cuz he might have someone else on the side. Its pretty messed up but teenage boys don't care much for sticking to 1 girl while they're still young. You'll be fine
tcHkn0VIaa	I would say it is unlikely that you are pregnant based on the intercourse from 2 days before your period. you usually ovulate 2 weeks after the first day of you last period and that was over 2 weeks ago. If this was the first time in a while for you then that could be one reason for your period to be late as well as any stress or extra activity. If that was the only time you had sex i would not worry but if you want just take a hpt.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Probably not. But, get a pill or something to prevent it quickly. You have one more day to prevent it if you don't want to be pregnant. So, I advice you to go to the doctor to get medicine for it before it's to late. AND I MEAN NOW!!!
8e62aeae88cc99e4727e560c786fd9b9aa	lOl.well take a EPT test.my last period was january 5th 2009.on feb 8 i took an ept test both negative.I had lots of nausea and sleepiness.constipation and also heat flashes...they say EPT and first response are the best brands...but you never know because it could be a false negative.im now 3 weeks late and pregos with my first.go to the doctors and get a blood test they are 100% more accurate although they're a bit costy$$$|`|R4NDgifmaa	i jus asked almost the same question on my page to..i think that it is a early sign of pregnancy becuz i did a lil research...
Czp44Zwlaa	Take another pregnancy test l|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	It is possible that you tested to early it is recommended not to test until after you miss your period...Good luck!|`|O71xlcG3aa	if you go to a clinic you can take a blood test for about $30 that is much more accurate, but yes you could be pregnant|`|uuHPneEcaa	some pregnancy and period symptoms are somewhat the same. <br>  <br>  wait until ur period is due and if it doesn't come then take a pregnancy test. I was 5 day late when I took mine and it was positive. u could have tested way to earily.. wait until u have missed and then take one a few days after that maybe u will get the answer ur lookin for|`|8RfmosODaa	You should wait til you miss a period first. Then retest. I was once late for my period 17 days then it finally came. Are you just getting off bc?|`|MPX0f5jzaa	That's kinda early for a home test to be accurate.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Yes u could still be preg and have tested to early.<br>  Wait another 4 5 days and test again x<br>  Good luck xx|`|FXINmF6saa	Maybe you are scared and that's why you're feeling this way. But you probably took an early test which gave you a not so precise answer. Try waiting 2 weeks after your expected period date. Then take another test. That one will be more accurate. If your still not satisfied with the results go in to the doctor's and get a test there. Doctor tests are better then any other one. Try to relax and not stress because that will cause you to miss your period and then you really won't know. The same thing happened to me, I was late but took a home test, came out positive, then I took a doctors tes, came out negative I then waited a week then took another doctor's test and it came out positive. I am about 10 weeks now. Good Luck and hopefully everything turns out the way you want. =)|`|VEEbzc4jaa	I would always recommend waiting to test after your period date has been and gone. Because like is happening now, u got a negative but still might think you are preggers.............<br>  <br>  It may have gave a true reading or you may have tested too early. Wait till about a week after period date then test if no show. Im sure there be enough pregnancy hormone in there by then.<br>  <br>  Wait next time. x|`|M1KYxcvSaa	If you've been having sex then it's possible you're pregnant, but it's doubtful you'd be having much in the way of pregnancy symptoms this early.  Wait till you've actually missed your period and test again.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	even though some tests say UP TO 5 days before, you really need to wait till after you miss your period if you want an accurate answer.|`|dq9uclgpaa	I think you might be. It might be too early to determine. wait until you miss your period and take another test.|`|soFpywFcaa	try waiting a week if you are pregnant than it was probably to early and your hcg hormone is on the low side|`|JDw1RDcaaa	take a test in about 2/3 weeks|`|HW89eJEZaa	you tested too early! wait a few more days.|`|hlWdFTcjaa	Its always best to wait until you have actually missed your period because you result will be more reliable. <br>  <br>  However you can still test now using an early pregnancy test that can test up to 6 days before you miss your period, but it all depends on how high the HCG hormone levels are for the test to produce a positive. <br>  <br>  So best thing to do, even though its hard, wait a week and then test again! Good luck hun!|`|SDVqRYZraa	I think so, because you took the test very early, leave it until you have missed your due date and take another. However i doubt you are, if it said negative but it wouldnt hurt to check again. If by symptons you mean morning sickness etc. that could always be caused by something else. If the second one says negative then maybe see your doctor.<br>  Good luck either way :)|`|W7wEgy1Eaa	Look.  EXPECT to get pregnant every single time you have sex.  EXPECT it.  That's what happens when you have sex.  Even using contraception.<br>  <br>  Be adult about it and wait for your menses to be late for heaven's sake.  Be more adult about it and think before you have sex.|`|oche3k5taa	Periods and pregnancies often have very similar symptoms.<br>  you should wait and see if you have your period.. wait another week, and take another test..if it says negative, and within another week you dont get your period, call your doctor.|`|7e92b286778f580b254e59f9b17fef12aa	You need to wait a few days for all of the hormones to show up!  The egg may not have implanted yet!  Test yourself again in about a week.  Hope it ends up being the result you want!|`|TUp54Eyaaa	I didn't test positive until the day after my missed period...even with the 'early detection' tests. Just be patient, and test again when you miss your period.|`|HI2t9cK7aa	try another one in few days time and good luck
wKuQC4yTaa	i sure hope so because I am 24 weeks and I still can sleep almost 12 hours and get a nap in there too.  thats after i fall asleep from my insomnia which is crazy because ill be dead tired but still awake. like the walking zombies|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I am exhausted too and 26 weeks as well...|`|BzCYQlcuaa	very normal. i am only 9 weeks and i cant even keep my eyes open. i cant even drive for more than 30 mins.. i just am soo sleepy. i have been going to bed at 7pm. i am really having a hard time i cant even do my house work. my house is a big mess and i just cant seem to do anything. i really don't think there is anyway to fix this! just part of pregnancy|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Yes, it's quite normal. It may be low iron which is very common during pregnancy. Ask your doctor for a prescription for iron tablets that are safe to take during pregnancy, and try to eat food that's high in iron like red meat, fish and spinach. Drinking Nettle Tea can help as well.<br>  <br>  It may also be you have low blood pressure, which would cause both these symptoms as well, and is common in pregnancy. There's not much you can do if it's low blood pressure. If you find you're getting light headed pumping your feet up and down like you're pressing on the brakes of your car can help improve your circulation though.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It can be normal...every woman varies.  I'm pretty tired most of the time (at 19 weeks).  I'm not too weak now but I was before on those weeks where I had very little appetite but its gotten better.  Are you eating enough?  I've added one Ensure a day...it totally helps.  I hate it because I hate milk so I guzzle it down early and get it over with but it helps.|`|uuHPneEcaa	Welcome to the wonderful world of being PREGNANT.. its totally normal.. one day u'll be totally not tired at all the next u'll feel like u can't go on... <br>  <br>  Right now I am feeling that way.. I have been like this for the last month.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	Yes tiredness is a huge thing in pregnancy, Listen to your body and rest when u can.<br>  As for the weakness I would contact my midwife as they may want to check your iron levels etc..<br>  Congrats on pregnancy x|`|KNxs4PrZaa	yea pretty normal, there is a possibility that your blood sugar has something to do with it, does it seem worse after meals/sugar?  in a few weeks they will do your blood glucose test and be able to determine if maybe you have some blood sugar issues that are making the weakness worst, i would mention it to the doctor. if this is the case they will set you up with a blood sugar monitor and special diet that will help. besides this possibility, i wouldnt worry about it i was exhausted my whole second trimester, i fell asleep at my desk at work all of the time!|`|cdFhaLmEaa	I'm not sure what you mean by weakness but it's normal to feel more fatigued as you head into the third trimester.  If you're concerned about it, talk to your doctor.  Be sure your iron levels are strong, too, as that's sometimes a cause of excess fatigue.|`|h3HjLZ4daa	there is a difference between normal and typical.  it's not typical to be exhausted at that point in your pregnancy but it's not abnormal.  there are things, however, besides the pregnancy that can cause it (thyroid issues come to mind) so be sure to discuss it with your doctor.|`|u4FUeppNaa	i'm 23 weeks and i could sleep all day and night if i could. People handle pregnancy differently then others, some feel great while others (like us) are exhausted. It's normal, however you could have low iron which makes you tired as well and is also common during pregnancy|`|la1KlgJ3aa	Go see your dr and ask him to send you for a blood test. It could just be the preg. but if your super tired all the time ide go for a blood test. I had the same problem and the blood work determined im anemic and need to take iron supplements to bring my blood level back up. Good Luck!!!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Fatigue is very normal.  I was tired ALL The time with my 1st.  as for weakness--WHERE??  In muscles?|`|ngiTDGT2aa	yes it's normal you should go see your doctor just in case.
PTdy6TWRaa	Mention to the teacher that your kids have told you that they would be thrilled to be picked to do some class chores. Ask her what is expected of the kids so they might be picked. Keep the conversation friendly and then see what happens in the following weeks. If there is no change then bring it up to her again.|`|VkM13OmEaa	I would be very sure of the situation before saying anything. Sometimes children's view of what goes on in class is not as accurate as it might be. They are young and still see things very much from an egocentric viewpoint. The world revolves around them, so if they do not get picked every day they think they are not being picked at all. When I was a child I could not understand why the teacher did not always ask me to answer when I raised my hand in class. Only as an adult did I realise that the teacher had to know that everyone had learnt the fact, and not just those who put their hands up. I am not in any way suggesting that your children are lying, just that their view of the world is still childish, as they are still children. <br>  If you can independently discover if the teacher is unfairly treating your children, then I would definitely speak to her in a gentle and friendly way to see if there is a reason for this, or if something can be done.
r7qm08fkaa	i am pro choice and believe that all women regardless of the circumstances have a total right to decide what happens with their body. believe me i don't support abortions 100% but neither am i against them. i think that if people who are against abortion think its so wrong, then they should simply just not do it, but let others decide what is right for them.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Writing an opinion paper does not involve asking a thousand strangers THEIR opinions.|`|v16ylsl8aa	Well its not the governments position to decide. Because Even though if you make it illegal it won't stop women from having botch abortion done. Meaning dead mothers and children. Not only that but the mother does have more right over the child than the government has. <br>  <br>  Argument supporting pro-life is mostly religious.|`|mTwn8p79aa	I'm a big fan of the argument, if you don't like abortions, then don't have one.<br>  <br>  Early term abortion is murder in the same way as masturbation is mass murder.  A fertilized egg isn't the same thing as a baby.  Sounds like a pretty simple case to me.  Good thing the supreme court and the vast majority of Americans agree with me.<br>  <br>  This argument always astounds me ". . . but if a 17 year old girl who cant keep her legs closed gets pregnant then no i dont think they should be allowed to."<br>  <br>  So, is it that the baby is punishment to a girl that you've deemed to be irresponsible that you like?  Fantastic argument for someone to be forced to have a baby, you're an irresponsible kid--YOU SHOULD BE A PARENT!  Great logic . . .  Goes right along with, ooh, you made a bad decision one night when you were in high school, let's make sure you're stuck working at target as a cashier on the night shift when you're 45.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	yes it should be legal, but i think the limit on how many weeks you are should be dropped to very low like 12 weeks and adoption there after is the only option|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i think what one woman decides to do with her body and her pregnancy doesnt affect anyone else so they shouldnt have a say in it and they should mind their own business.|`|fPAlfokHaa	Before i get shot down for this im pregnant and no i did not choose to have an abortion. However, i think it is a womans right to choose to have an abortion. Maybe the choice isnt for everyone but just because i wouldnt do it doesnt mean i would say noone else should have the legal right to do it. Yes people can argue about the childs rights but what about the mothers rights? I think 24 weeks is too long  though i think it should be shortened to 20 weeks when there it is more than likely the baby wouldnt survive if born.|`|FRjriJNuaa	it depends. <br>  If a 13 year old child is raped by a family member or if a woman is raped by a random stranger and they become pregnant then yes they should be able to no questions asked but if a 17 year old girl who cant keep her legs closed gets pregnant then no i dont think they should be allowed to.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Legal or not if someone wants an abortion they will find a way to do it. I am not for them at all, but some are and I think they should have the option to do so.|`|XHcyDT2Xaa	abortion should not be legal at all.  it is killing another human that is not brought into this world yet...its like murder but worse
F9pAWBG9aa	nothing is wrong you are lucky =) be glad the cramps and tenderness is going away. if you start bleeding or having severe cramps  then call the doctor otherwise you sound like a normal pregnant person to me =) congrats|`|cdFhaLmEaa	Not necessarily.  Symptoms can ebb and flow in a normal pregnancy as your hormone levels change and your body adjusts.  Unless you feel all pregnancy symptoms subside, you have extreme cramping, or you're spotting or bleeding, assume all is well.  I know it's hard waiting to hear the heartbeat for the first time and get some reassurance!|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Nope..You're just one of the lucky ones!<br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Nope!  Be glad.  Some women go through pregnancy with symptoms all nine months---some dont get them at all!|`|xb6uZrluaa	they will come and go untill you hit about 13 weeks and then you will be so nautious you will hate even waking up in the morning enjoy it the passing time while you can|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i had was really sick in the begin, i am 9 weeks and my symptoms are now slowing down. i now don't have the morning sickness that much anymore but now i am more sleepy. so my symptoms are just changing. i got the best book and it tells you what symptoms you should have week by week. and remember not everyone has the same symptoms. my book says the common symptoms are!<br>  <br>  the book is called "what to expect when your excepting" you really should get this book! it tells you EVERYTHING from symptoms you may have, what to do with tattoos, breastfeeding, i mean it has everything i could think of!! talks about things like anal sex well pregnant.

B0bWrvanaa	im 41 weeks pregnant and going in to get induced on saturday. im thining and im not dilated at all. <br>  <br>  read some books and try to relax. thats what im doing. i know what you mean anxiety is killing us.|`|JreuGwJYaa	I've been there. Usuaslly with your first baby labor takes longer. I was dialted to two for two months before I had my son.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Stay busy. Go walk the mall and look at all the baby stores for cute clothes. Rent some movies. Spend some time with your friends.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Go shopping for some clothes for your little one. Spend some times with friends and family.... I have never been there, but, just thought I'd tell you some things to do...
OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, you are pretty small..but every woman is different.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	You don't even look pregnant although that's not unusual for the first baby.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	you dont look pregnant what-so-ever im only 10 weeks and i already have a baby bump|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Wow for 19 weeks ur really SMALL.but dont worry about it if ur doctor think`s it fine.you look Great!!|`|i8Ch743Laa	If it's your first pregnancy,it's understandable that you're that small. I know that I didn't show with my first until 6 1/2-7 months. You suggested many reasons that you could be small,and I would try to not worry about it. I think you do indeed look small,but no smaller than I was at 19 weeks with my first.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Your first pregnancy, no worries I didn't start to show for 6 months. With my 2nd started to show earlier. With this one I am only 8 1/2 weeks and I can't fit into ANY of my clothes. <br>  <br>  You look normal don't worry. Every woman is different. And like I said this is your first pregnancy.|`|TGzOrftPaa	All women's bellies grow at different rates!  At your next appointment your doctor should go over the height of your uterus; they'll measure it with a tape measure.  So if you're going to be 20 weeks 20 cm would be normal (give or take 2 cm).  That's how you know if your baby's growing right!  Generally how far along you are in weeks is how long the uterine height should be.  Otherwise enjoy being small for the time being and just wait til the belly pops out!  Good luck.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I didn't start showing until I was almost 6 months....Now I have a huge basketball in there!!!|`|cO10vvWsaa	hi how are you! I remember you from trying to conceive section! <br>  I just had my baby girl 1 month ago.. <br>  <br>  I was always told throughout my pregnancy that i was too small as well! when i gave birth it seemed like i was 7 months or 8. <br>  <br>  Well my baby weighed 7 pounds 12 ounces! So the belly never matters, it doesn't show the real bulk of a baby. So congrats to you!<br>  <br>  this was me at 16 weeks!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg259/claudia2207/IMG_8193.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg259...</a>|`|B0bWrvanaa	yea i showed a lot more than you are but i originally was bigger than you. that's just the way it is. wait til your 36 weeks and more...youll be all stretched out and not comfortable. <br>  believe me...i miss being pregnant and not being so noticeable. enjoy it. in a month you'll probably blossom.<br>  <br>  i'm 41 weeks and am getting induced on Saturday!!<br>  <br>  congrats|`|1S5AbPueaa	Whoa your baby bump is almost non existent.Yes you look small,but if this is your first baby it is normal to not show early. I am sure baby is fine and you just wait until you get to be farther along you'll pop out!!|`|8am8ExsKaa	Small is not the word, you don't even look pregnant. I am almost 16 weeks with baby #2 and I am really showing alot. I'm sure you'll blossom out soon enough.|`|X8i0XqCKaa	Yes you are extremely small, where is the baby inside there?! Lol! I think I'm like 10 times that size and I'm 23 weeks. =] <br>  <br>  I'm gonna take a guess and say you're having a girl...<br>  =]|`|dgRTkccBaa	Yes, you're small. Everyone carries differently, as long as the doc says your ok i would not worry.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	You are small but every woman is different and by the looks of it you are very fit if your abbs are very toned it is going to be harder for your uterus to pop out there a little bit but don't worry it will happen soon enough. And for added peace of mind you are going to the dr soon so they will make sure everything is fine.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	You are small, but this is your first pregnancy. Some women do not show until 5 or 6 months. I had a friend who seriously did not show until she was 7 1/2 months pregnant. If you have a long torso, that is why you are not showing as much as others. Also, if you are on the taller side that can effect it too. I'm sure you will be fine. :-)|`|98WKYtfwaa	What the hell is Shawn talking about? <br>  <br>  Yes i think you're very small for 19weeks, you don't even look pregnant at all. I started showing at 16weeks and i was huge by 18weeks, now at 22weeks i'm even bigger, but i'm very small and have a small torso. <br>  <br>  If your doc says all is fine then don't worry. Some don't show until they're 6/7months.|`|InslW3QMaa	Your pregnant? I'm sorry i can't tell|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Oh yes, but your belly will grow later on.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	You are completely flat.  Are you sure you're pregnant?|`|XzbRZCPUaa	sometimes you don't show till at least 5 or 6 months especially with your first|`|VEkkn2Otaa	thats not normal|`|qfNK5aDEaa	Girl, r u sure u r pregnant. I was small like u but in the last 2 months u will grow, big and fast. Everyone used to tell me I was small up until I was about 28 weeks pregnant and now everyone says "Ur gettin so big" so yea..|`|ojVl4Gowaa	Wow, you have a long torso! And if people say your small then take it as a compliment. As long as you're eating healthy and the baby is fine, then you'll show when you show (and probably just a cute bump).|`|7xit1ogxaa	Yes, you are small. You don't even look pregnant. Enjoy it while you can because soon you will definitely be big.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Don't worry. I didn't show until 6.5 months.<br>  <br>  You're baby is growing just fine!|`|UsJDUm1Haa	If your doctor said you have a big torso then im sure thats why. dont worry im sure everything will be fine! :]|`|2HX9sIwpaa	YOUR FINE SWEETIE. I DIDN'T START SHOWING AROUND 8MONTHS.|`|e8259d706e4c0ff624821e09f8c00d53aa	I didn't show at 19 weeks either. Don't worry, its coming. With how small you are it will be very obvious before long.|`|irFsdhtyaa	yes you are small but im 6 months and look the exact same and so did my friends until they were like 7 months|`|JreuGwJYaa	your really small but thats common for your first baby.|`|0YdWJVyAaa	ya i think so , my tummy  definitely looked much bigger than yours at this stage ..|`|wnPqeJoWaa	your baby will grow just be patient|`|NYJgiVxraa	u barely have anything! lol. i look like i have more in the tank then you do.. but im not pregnant. wow yeh ur tiny :).|`|IZTmipyaaa	I'm jealous! You don't look pregnant at all! When i was 19 weeks, i had a small bump, you could hardly notice it. Enjoy your figure while it lasts. I'm 39 weeks pregnant and I look like I swallowed a basketball!|`|MTeN6WpPaa	You look like you exercise thats why your still small your muscles are very toned, haha. but i started showing pretty good at about 6 months though you could tell a little earlier but i just looked more fat than anything lol|`|FUBNkpwSaa	Dont worry, as long as the doctor says your fine.<br>  Be happy you're so small, perhaps you'll get back to pre-baby shape quicker!<br>  <br>  and congrats by the way ;)!|`|94kNwMPdaa	wow. you really are small. if i saw you in person i wouldn't even guess you were pregnant.<br>  <br>  But yes every pregnancy is different|`|7WygI8p2aa	you can see a little baybay on its way :)|`|lgqap3Mmaa	o ma goodness your stomach iz smaller than mine and i'm not even pregnant.|`|9jSmmIxfaa	You dont even look pregnant!

WxQFe0GYaa	Yes, of course you can make your own.  Just try to steer clear of canned fruits and veggies.  Fresh or frozen are better.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	Absolutley! Even if times arent hard I think its best to make fresh baby food for babies! I made almost all my son's food for him. I bought a food mill online. The one I got was from www.cheekymonkey.com but any will do. Steam you fresh fruits and veg and put them through the mill. You could use a food processor instead but I found it didnt quite get things small enough. I got most of my ideas from www.wholesomebabyfood.com It is a wonderful site and I still pull info from there from time to time!<br>  Good Luck & Have fun!|`|AA11481889	I would use Fresh Fruit because you can control the sugar ....but the canned veggies are good to go.<br>  <br>  Put them in the blender add water until it's the right consistency....done.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Definitely! You can google Baby Food Recipes, and it will give you some good ones. Other than that, take some veggies, fruit, meat, rice, whatever you are using...steam or boil in a little water. Puree in a blender with a little of the water it was boiled in...or mash if baby is taking mashes foods. Canned works great...fresh is better, but canned and frozen are just fine if that's what is on hand. It's healthier this way cause you know what's in it, it's made fresh at home, and there are no preservatives.|`|5e4fFMf7aa	weeell, <br>  maybe boil the fruits and veggies and mash em up.<br>  then cook it once again ALL SMASHED up. <br>  put it into a bowl.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  dig in babyy|`|yo65rDLDaa	i would mash banana for sure they love that.. and also mashed patatoes and mashed pees... women have done that for hundreds of years|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I agree with Margarita.  I LOVE Wholesomebabyfood.com.  I LOVE making my own baby food, even though I work and find it very difficult to find the time.  But read the side of the cans.  A lot of canned foods have added salt - NOT GOOD for baby!.  Try Frozen veggies instead.  <a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/using-canned-food-for-homemade-baby-food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/using-c...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	I think it depends on how long your baby has been eating solids. Has your baby been having rice cereal for some time? It is recommended to start babies on rice cereal before anything else. You mix that with either just water, formula or breastmilk.<br>  <br>  I would not give your baby vegetables out of a can as they add salt to them. Babies should not have any extra salt added to their food. It's also not good to start your baby on fruit as it is very sweet and they baby might not want other food (like vegetables) after having fruit.<br>  <br>  If you have done rice cereal for at least couple of weeks and your baby has got used to eating it then you can start on giving him/her some vegetables but it is best to buy them fresh and then boil them (or steam) and mash finely or puree. Sweet potatoes, carrots and peas are good to start with. When the baby has got used to some veggies then you can start giving them some banana, pureed apple and other sweeter things.<br>  <br>  Just remember to only give them one thing at a time and give them that same food for at least 3 days in a row in case they are allergic to it as then you will know which food they are allergic to.<br>  <br>  Here are some recipies:<br>  <a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/stage1_homemade_baby_food_recipes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/stage1_...</a>|`|D8vOpNWgaa	fruits are harder then veggies but with veggies if they are hard steam or boil them grind them up like you would mashed potatoes some veggies are thicker then others you will be able to tell which ones are to thick for your child and mix with water or formula. fruits are the same way but you need to push them through netting b/c of seeds. easiest fruits are bananas but fruits usually need to be fresh the cans have a lott of added suger|`|4c56a58a21408d082872a390ecb9be97aa	Hello, I always prepared food for my baby myself.

Bw1h5xAcaa	It can be serious. There is no cure other than to deliver the baby. When they decide to induce depends on how bad the preeclampsia has gotten. It can worsen very quickly, and turn into eclampsia, which involves seizures, and it can also lead to placental abruption (placenta pulls away from uterine wall causing hemorrhage) due to high blood pressure. It can also lead to liver dysfunction which causes abnormalities in clotting factors in your blood, also very dangerous. <br>  <br>  Most of the time it doesn't get that serious because they catch it early through routine monitoring during pregnancy and they induce labor in time. So don't worry too much about your friend.|`|AA10636233	I had it with my second baby, and Nothing serious happened. I had wicked headaches, and they were vary careful about watching my blood loss, but it all turned out good. <br>  My cousin had it with her first, and it became so bad that she suffered from something called Bells Palsy.  Her face muscles were kinda paralyzed for the last day(everything was droopy), until she delivered, then within a few hours everything was fine, and her face worked again. It can be scary, but telling her stories about this stuff can make it worse by making her worry and thus raising her blood pressure. Always know what the worst can be, but hope for the best, that way you are prepared to deal with whatever needs to be dealt with, and can understand the treatment options.|`|wb781QEzaa	It is real serious, it can cause many complications. It is real high blood pressure which causes dizziness, water retention,etc. can cause the baby to go into cardiac arrest in the womb. Go to webmd.com and type in pre-eclampsia and it will list all the facts about it and side effects and it might help you understand it a little better. Hope her and the baby are fine.|`|kvYgopThaa	It means your friends blood pressure is high. This can be serious, but since the doctors know about your friends situation and they are inducing her I wouldn't worry unless they gave you cause to.|`|AA11537580	it's high blood pressure<br>  I had it and had to take medication<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclampsia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-eclamps...</a>|`|MKnpH4XKaa	Yes I did when I was in labor I felt terrible until they put me on IV's<br>  <br>  but I did fine I got a healthy beautiful daughter.
jBnQiZVFaa	Although they are technically the same thing, I would mix it gradually to ease the transition.  The consistancy is a little different and she might notice, especially being so sensitive.  I would do an ounce powder to three RTF, then two to two, then three to one, and then make the whole switch.  Each stage for a couple days.  My son was hard to figure out what to feed too, so I get that feeling of not wanting to disrupt the status quo.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	If she is on Alimentum, she probably has a pretty sensitive system, so I would be careful. But my friends baby was able to switch to other formulas at about 6 months, so the light is at the end of the tunnel!|`|AA10529334	If you mix the powder formula as directed it should be exactly the same as the ready to feed formula was. It should cause no problems for your baby.|`|V6slDthdaa	If it's the same type, just powder it should be fine to switch right over. But you can wean her if it makes you more comfortable.|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	My son is on the RTF because he has a corn allergy. The powder form DOES have corn in it so you might want to be a little careful switching...the corn may upset her tummy if she isn't used to it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!! :)|`|V8GrFx0jaa	It may help to mix the formula ahead of time, to let the bubbles settle out and be sure the powder has thoroughly dissolved.|`|fHjSonssaa	My son initially was fed Enfamil Enfacare due to his prematurity.  They fed him ready to feed in the hospital- but w few days before he was discharged, the ready to feed ran out and their shipment hadn't come in- so they switched him to can.  They didn't ease the transition.  And it shouldn't matter what type/brand of formula it is either.<br>  All it is is someone else mixing the water in for you- there's nothing else different about it.  It's more of a convenience.<br>  <br>  So, personally, I would say you don't HAVE to slowly transition her over- but if it makes YOU feel better, go for it.<br>  <br>  I know there are lots of things I do for my son that I think make ME more comfortable, but ultimately, it doesn't really matter.

zlciavc1aa	The safest way is to go to a doc and find out. I had yeast infection when i first found out i was pregnant. I refused to take anything over the counter being that i was pregnant. So my doc prescribed a safe vaginal cream.|`|SPMr3ZJFaa	It is most likely a yeast infection which is not a big deal when you're pregnant...and you are much more likely to get them while you are pregnant.  Generally the OTC stuff is what your Dr. will have you use.  BUT please go to the doctor (or at least call).  While chances are that it is yeast it is also common to have things get out of kilter the other direction and have too much bacteria down there.  That is called BV (bacterial vaginosis, which is just big word to mean bacterial infection)  THAT is dangerous during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Basically, yeast and bacteria compete and keep each other in check, so if something (like pregnancy or antibiotics) causes one or the other to be depleted, the other takes over and you get an infection.  Chances are you have yeast, but make sure.<br>  <br>  So call the doc...anytime anything is weird down there while your pregnant...in fact get used to talking to your doctor because the two of you will be on the phone a lot over then next few months :)|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Just call your doctor and they can order you something that is safe for pregnancy.

But because several different things (some of them bacterial or viral and slightly more dangerous) can seem like a yeast infection, its very important that when you are pregnant you get it diagnosed and treated by a doctor. Do not self diagnose and use an over the counter remedy when you are pregnant.|`|AA11208683	a yeast infection will not harm the baby at all and is not dangerous for it... the baby is to protected for any thing like that to happen. was to keep a yeast infection away are as follows... always wipe from front to back....rinsing your vaginal area thoroughly after soaping during a bath or shower.... skipping irritating or perfumed soaps, and bubble baths.... wearing cotton underwear, and avoiding tight pants or leggings.... let the area breathe whenever you can... and eating yogurt containing live probiotic cultures may help keep it at bay. the symptoms you can look for are... a yellowish, greenish, or thick and cheesy discharge that has a foul odor, accompanied by burning, itching, redness or soreness.... but i would call your doctor even if you think it can be that because it can get very annoying i have been told. and it is very common in pregnancy. i hope this helps...

vhlORK4Waa	If you are planning to become pregnant you should take folic acid supplements and, once pregnant, continue to take the supplements for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. If you take folic acid supplements it reduces the risk of having a baby born with a defect of their spinal cord such as spina bifida. <br>  <br>  <br>  What is folic acid?<br>  <br>  Folic acid (folate) is a vitamin and is needed to make new cells in the body. The body does not store very much folic acid. You need a regular fresh supply to keep healthy. Pregnant women in particular need a good supply of folic acid which is used by the developing baby. <br>  <br>  Many foods contain folic acid including vegetables such as spinach, sprouts, broccoli, green beans, and potatoes. Some bread and breakfast cereals are fortified with folic acid.<br>  <br>  Folic acid supplements and pregnancy<br>  <br>  You should start taking folic acid tablets before becoming pregnant (from the time you plan to become pregnant). If the pregnancy is unplanned then start taking folic acid tablets as soon as you know that you are pregnant. Continue to take folic acid tablets for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy - even if you eat a good diet. You can buy folic acid tablets from pharmacies.<br>  <br>  If you take folic acid tablets in early pregnancy you reduce the risk of having a baby born with a spinal cord problem such as spina bifida. This is because the early development of the baby's spinal cord requires a regular good supply of folic acid. <br>  <br>  What dose should I take?<br>  <br>  For most women the dose is 400 micrograms (0.4mg) a day. <br>  If your risk of having a child with a spinal cord problem is increased then the dose is higher (5mg a day - you need a prescription for this higher dose). That is, if: <br>  you have had a previously affected pregnancy. <br>  your partner, or a first-degree relative, have a spinal cord defect. <br>  you have coeliac disease (as your intake of folate may be affected by this condition). <br>  you are taking medication for epilepsy. <br>  you have sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia. <br>  In addition to folic acid supplements, you should eat a healthy diet when you are pregnant which should include foods rich in folic acid.<br>  <br>  Are there any side-effects or risks when taking folic acid?<br>  <br>  No. Folic acid is a naturally occurring vitamin which your body needs. It is not a drug (medicine). By taking these supplements you are just making sure that you get a good, regular amount of folic acid which you need especially during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Further information<br>  <br>  Information on the Department of Health's website - www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/HealthAn... <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Halcon|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If you are trying to concieve, it is a good idea to take vitamins and folic acid before hand. Especially the folic acid. Because folic acid is what helps reduce the risks of having any neural tube defects. Since the neural tube closes within the first few weeks of conception (before you would know you were pregnant), taking folic acid for this reason is important before pregnancy. (Although it won't hurt too bad if you don't..it's just an extra precaution). <br>  <br>  When you take vitamins before you get pregnatn it just makes for a more condusive environment for a baby to thrive and lower your chances for miscarriage!|`|afeNK6oSaa	yep, as soon as you decide to get pregnant, although none of my pregnancies were planned and I didn't start taking them till after i found out.  All of my babies are still healthy, folic acid is a must from the start of conception- it is the most important for them.|`|YFPMcHCbaa	Yes you should. Three months beforehand is ideal. Folic acid is proven to prevent all kinds of birth defects and prenatal vitamins will help fill the nutritional voids in your diet and get your body in tip-top shape for conceiving.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Yes, if you are ttc you should be taking vitamins I would say 3 months so you have a good amount of folic acid. I can't think of any cons to taking vitamins, although all natural ones are better. Any health food store will have them. Good Luck|`|qDBjH4s8aa	Yes, ideally all women of childbearing age should take prenatals, to build up folic acid. Start now. OTC vitamins are as good as prescription.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Yes!  As soon as you start TTC you should be on prenatal vitamins.  They reduce the chance of birth defects and stem abnormalities, which occur very very early on in formation.|`|xpstigPTaa	Absolutely! My doctor put me on a pre-natal vitamin and extra folic acid 3 months prior to ttc! Best of luck!!!|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Yes, reason being that the baby's neural tube begins forming early in the pregnancy...sometimes before we even know we are pregnant! Better to be safe and if your TTC to take a prenatal with F.A.<br>  Best of luck|`|zlciavc1aa	YES. Doctors do recommend it if you're planning on getting pregnant. Myself personally i started taking vitamins and folic acid 3 mos prior to conceiving. Good luck.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	As soon as you confirm that you will be TTC, then start taking the vitamins!|`|KatjfLLwaa	It is a good idea. Eating healthy and exercising would help too.|`|VS8mactUaa	3 months before you start trying to conceive they reccommend taking folic acid. As for the vitamins you dont have to but it desnt hurt being in tip top health before trying. Good Luck.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Yes, the folic acid also helps with the implementation.|`|qPCjUckvaa	I started on One-a-Day prenatals with DHA six months before trying to conceive.  My GYN said they are great for all women of child-bearing age to take throughout their lives.  They are formulated with the right amounts of iron, calcium, folate (folic acid), and other minerals to keep us healthy; as a bonus, they are great for our skin, nails, and hair!  <br>  <br>  Another reason to begin a healthy prenatal vitamin (and healthy lifestyle in general) before you get pregnant is so that you have a routine already established when you find out you are pregnant.  There is no way to to predict if/when you will get pregnant for sure, even if you are monitoring your fertility, so my doctor said that you should begin acting, eating, and exercising, etc. as if you already are pregnant as soon as you begin trying.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, and I hope this info helps!|`|0ujpiBTCaa	3 years! Not even kidding. Anyhow, that's what we are supposed to recommend. Most people can't plan that far ahead.<br>  Your diet over the past 5-10 years can affect the pregnancy! Incredible.<br>  <br>  Start eating as healthy as you can as soon as you can. If you need to take vitamins to get all the nutrients you need, so be it, but don't take any massive doses.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	Absolutely! It's even good for women to take prenatals if they're NOT planning on getting pregnant. I take them when I'm not pregnant, and I took them while trying to get pregnant. And I take them now that I am pregnant. And I will continue to take them for a LONG LONG time! :)|`|96HWpdkFaa	Yes! It helps get your body prepared and it's good for the baby
876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	i think you should just pull yourself together...go up to him and ask him why you aren't friends anymore...that if you guys were friends then you two should be able to talk things out...a text will probably make him mad so face to face would be better...if you feel waiting til you're stronger is best then you should wait...but don't wait too long or else you'll regret waiting...<br>  <br>  as for your best friends...i don't think that it's that they don't care...i think it's just because they're his friends also and that they don't want to push aside one friend for the other...and make sure that if you do confront him then make sure it's alone...don't bring anyone else with you cuz that would make him feel like you're turning everyone else against him|`|lBINJvevaa	just ignore him.... you're too good for all of them.|`|F6pD9tEvaa	A text is fine!!<br>  <br>  Women are different to men, im only 15, but from experience, women are very ppy to chat on the phone and hve long lengthy conversations but many men just get embarassed.<br>  <br>  So send him a text, tell him exctly how you feel, and if he feels the same, chances are he didn't make the first move as he is scared of confronting you :)<br>  <br>  If you have windows live messenger (msn) or other..     thats always a good way to solve arguments..<br>  <br>  but by what you said in your story about him, and judgg by your general aura, you can do a lot better :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, xx|`|d7kGopYxaa	text is fine. but POUR YOUR HEART OUT GIRL!
6qCnpxrNaa	Yes, he could choke on it as it becomes soggy and starts to break apart.  It's also not a good idea to give them that much concentrated sugar at that age.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Well, it really isn't a good idea for his teeth to be sucking on a sugary treat several times a day everyday.  I would say occasionally, such as once every week or two would be okay, but I definitely would try to break the habit of every time he gets upset, he gets cookies.  He really young to start such a bad habit.  Although it may be a quick fix, there are other techniques and things you should try instead.  They may take longer the first few trys to calm him down, but the benefits will far out weight the extra time it takes to calm him.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"im asking if it the oreos could be harmful to him."<br>  <br>  Well, sure; yes, they're junk food. But there's nothing about an Oreo that makes it more or less harmful to him than any other crap food.<br>  <br>  I would try and stop for _your_ sake -- you'll go through a box a day with a toddler otherwise.<br>  <br>  LOLZ at the idiot recommending "baby cookies" -- lady -- those are sugar and white flour, too; they're just sold in a different part of the supermarket...|`|dgRTkccBaa	Not good for him, break the habit as soon as you can.  Oreos (while delicious) are loaded with saturated fat, sodium and sugar, not to mention the caffeine he's getting from the chocolate (oreos have alot, if I eat them before bed I have trouble sleeping).  He doesn't NEED an oreo to calm down and the only way he'll have them is if you're giving them to him.|`|vDdHmLk7aa	OMG people calm down, it's an Oreo not rat poison!!!!<br>  <br>  I mean yes, it is total sugar and fat, and yes, it's not great to calm a baby with food, but holy crap who of us hasn't been in the position where our LO is crying and we'll do anything to stop it? Let's not judge. I would say, try to limit the Oreos as much as possible and clean his teeth/gums very vigilantly every day, but if you have to give him an Oreo every once in a while to save your sanity, don't feel bad about it.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	"i just want to know if sucking on oreos can be bad for him?"<br>  are oreos good for anyone!?!??!<br>  They have such a high sugar content he is probably freaking out from withdrawls!!! Find a baby cookie to give him instead... get rid of the oreo habbit!<br>  <br>  of course they can harm him. ever heard of early onset diabeties or childhood obesity... those kinds of things are mostly caused by sweets and crap food...<br>  <br>  baby cookies have way less sugar than regular cookies. they are mostly made of rice cereal. and break apart and disolve fast in a child's mouth to not be a choking hazard... <br>  sure the kid is not sucking on a celery stick but its a lot better than an oreo...|`|PwrF9OtWaa	they have really good teething cookies. some if them are really sweet i can't even stand them. we got max these vanilla organic ones. he LOVES them. <br>  look for a really sweet baby teething biscuit and give him that instead. don't give into his temper tantrums and definitely don't give him any more oreos. <br>  <br>  <br>  they're BAD FOR HIM (to answer your question) and you can give him oreos ZERO times per day. bottom line. ask your doctor, i dare you to see what he says.|`|16vwEBiqaa	As far as the danger of giving your child chocolate there doesn't seem to be any harm health wise. He is obviously not allergic to it.<br>  <br>  Sugar wise...there is about 14g of sugar in a serving size of oreos (with 15 servings per container I'm estimating thats about 2-3 cookies. ) So lets say one cookie has about 7g of sugar. Similac Advanced has 3g of sugar per serving...but wait...one serving is 1oz. So that means if your child drinks 6 ounces in a single bottle he is getting 18g of sugar per bottle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nabiscoworld.com/Brands/ProductInformation.aspx?BrandKey=oreo&Site=1&Product=4400000820" rel="nofollow">http://www.nabiscoworld.com/Brands/Produ...</a><br>  <br>  So your son is getting more sugar from a bottle of formula than that cookie.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/baby-foods/452/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/baby-...</a><br>  <br>  By justifying your actions I am in no way agreeing with them. I just wanted to give you the info I thought you were looking for.<br>  <br>  I just realized I didn't answer the question...its not bad. Just not great. No harm no foul. For now.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	Yes, Oreo Cookies are bad for him, don't give him any more. besides setting him up to make unhealthy choices in the future you maybe causing him health problems, especially since he has "CF". Too much sugar from unnatural sources (High Fructose Corn Syrup, and sugar based preservatives)  can cause a lower immune system if given to a toddler. If your child was 4 or 5 this wouldn't be a problem but he's notm he is a baby, it's not okay stop. <br>  <br>  You should never use food as a way to get him calm, that's lazy. Get off the computer and hold him, kiss him, show him you love him, give him a bottle, give him a teething ring. Don't be lazy.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	First off: OH MY GOSH to all the other Answerers!!!!!!<br>  <br>  It is a Freakin' OREO for crying out loud! Its not posion!<br>  <br>  Its not bad that you give them to him, its just not a good idea for a soother for when he is upset. <br>  <br>  It could be a treat for when he eats good! So, try and break the habit of giving him a cookie every once in a while for when he eats good, or as a dessert.<br>  <br>  Try and find something else that will soothe him like peices of fruit or something! But, no its not going to harm your baby! These people are nuts!<br>  <br>  I must be a horrible Mom because whatever Im eating, and my daughter wants a bite, then so be it. Because to me, if you dont let them have sweets every once in a while when they get older they will rebel and become a horrible eater...|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It's not the spoiling him a a little you should worry about...it's the non nutritious foods. You shouldn't have started it, but now is the time to stop. If you stop giving them to him, even when he cries, he'll eventually get the picture. I wouldn't give him anymore at all til he's a little older. That seems like a bit of a choking hazard as well. I dunno, personally, I'd wait til at least 1 year for that...and then only rarely. Maybe a cookie a week at most. Then again, I want my daughter to eat healthy and when you start junk foods at a young age, they tend to eat more of them and not want their veggies. Ask his doc and I'm sure you'll get a similar answer.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You really should break that habit quick!  Food shouldn't be used to calm a freaking out baby or child.  He should be able to be soothed with a toy or something else.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Oreos are harmful.  They're pure sugar and shouldn't be used as a babysitter.|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	The sugar content is waaaay too high for a 7 month old. Is there any possibility he's teething? Have you tried a teething ring?|`|fhzHiBMyaa	Food?! Calming down a baby?! You have to break this habit before it gets WORSE, he could maybe want the whole pack! Just kidding. But try giving him something else that's healthier.|`|izR8tmGSaa	Giving a baby Oreo Cookies or anything else with "High Fructose Corn Syrup" is bad.  <br>  <br>  Here are a few tips, <br>  <br>  1. Granulated sugar or sugar cane is okay in moderation (this means  twice a week or less)<br>  <br>  2. Regular corn syrup like "Karos Dark" is okay in moderation (again, twice a week or less)<br>  <br>  3. "High Fructose Corn Syrup" is never okay for a child under 2 and should never be given to a child under 2. <br>  <br>  I know that you think 2 cookies are okay, but those 2 cookies can actually cause the babies incoming teeth to decay, you really don't want to have a 1 year old with cavities do you?  I'm not trying to be judge mental but if your question is "is it bad for him/her" I would answer yes. High Fructose Corn syrup, which is found in Oreo Cookies, kills the tiny Amoebae that live in the babies mouth, tummy and throat. Since the baby does not have an adult immune system yet his/her body relays on Amoebae to destroy harmful bacteria, so you see, giving your baby cookies with HFCS in them at this age is BAD. <br>  <br>  next time check the back of the cookie box if it says "Corn Syrup" it's generally okay but if it says "High Fructose Corn Syrup" put it back on the self <br>  (..__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")_(")|`|myKePYMJaa	yea.... good point. i gave my kid a hit of crack to shut him up while i watch Jerry Springer. now he is pimping his big sister to get more. definately get him help.|`|TQ47vny4aa	No I don't see it being harmful as long as you let him dip it in milk first. lol  I also agree with everyone else way to much sugar for him. Okay every now and then but will become a very bad habbit.|`|G6eBvDz8aa	I would buy the smaller ones.. or the 100 calories ones.. I'd assume they'd be not as bad for him as the larger ones.. :/|`|chlvKoXqaa	BESIDES THE SUGAR THE PRESERVATIVES IN IT ARE VERY BAD FOR HIM,|`|2IATHTXwaa	it's not that bad I give me baby oreos all the time and ice cream too, to many haters all up in here, you go girl give him another cookie!
wrzUD1rMaa	He's trying to impress you and your friends and probably any other poor person who he happens by in his car. If it really bothers you tell your parents or at least don't walk alone.|`|ZyG41K8Paa	Do you have a parenting questin? You are going to make parents angry|`|Ik1JCWXyaa	he is try to prove that is a showoffish idiot

Pops open a bottle of.....milk. ;~)<br>  <br>  <<<<<<<<<Hugs>>>>>>>>>>  Kiss Diego for me.|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	I would give it a day.  It should HOPEFULLY work sooner .. BUT it supposed to take a while.  Good luck hope you get your little guy soon.  The fact that you are 3 cm I think you will go soon with in the day or two if that.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If it works for you then you can start labor anytime within the next 24 hours. Good luck!|`|yKS2UI87aa	It never worked for me and my Dr. did it about 4 times from week 38 on.

Bg6txvxqaa	When people are that worried then they need somewhere to turn and as they are pregnant, why not post in the pregnancy section?!<br>  <br>  There should be an abortion category on here to people could decide to go there if they wanted in order to answer queries about it.<br>  <br>  Women's health doesn't really sum it up.<br>  <br>  I think that only pregnant wonem can give a tidy answer to abortion really as they understand what that person may be going through and there are some women on here, myself included a few years ago, who would have liked to have had the oppurtunity to talk to someone who may have been through it before and come out the other side, or someone who was pregnant and was thoughtful enough to answer in a way that no-one else could as they knew what it felt like to have a life inside of them instead of someone just saying, 'Yeah go for it'.<br>  <br>  What I hate is the abuse you see these people getting for askign a simple question. You have no idea how scared they are at that time in their lives and how emotional a time it is for them. Abortion is a difficult and life changing decision which will affect that person forever and they need advice from people with experience, not to be bombarded with abuse or people saying about adoption cos most of the time, abortion is a last choice and adoption cannot even come into the equation, I know it couldn't when I was pregnant the first time.<br>  <br>  Leave them be, if you don't like what they are asking, just don't answer the question. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Going by your argument about not wanting to hear about a baby's death when you're pregnant... what about the questions about still birth or miscarriage?! Do you feel the same about that?!|`|7xit1ogxaa	I don't like seeing them, but it is a pregnancy issue. There is no separate category to put these questions.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	It's a place for pregnant women to get informed. Thus, why it's called "answers". So, no. I do not agree. But opinions are like that.|`|GpR5MI5raa	it is posted an aweful lot, but what other section would it be in? It has to do with pregnancy.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	what's more annoying to me is seeing the questions about 'Am I pregnant?' like 50 times a day.  Take a test, since no one on here is a psychic and can tell from a question.<br>  <br>  I don't mind the abortion ones, people need help.  I posted one because my dr suggested it.  I am not for it, and wanted real life people opinions.<br>  <br>  If you don't like reading them just skip them which is what I do.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	people have the blimin right to choose what they do, if you dont agree fair enough , thats your opinion but people have thier own opinions and if you dont like the questions then dont look or read them!!! simple really.|`|KK718Xxaaa	because they are stupid homie.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family <br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot <br>  i gave it to a juggalo<br>  lol sexiest killa u know <br>  peace. im out. <br>  bloody B|`|joPJtKemaa	People find it amusing to bring this up just to start arguments.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah its people who just try to get some kind of response from us preggos.  I really think its horrible too.  Plus if you think about it who would be in the pregnancy section if they were trying to get an abortion?  They are just weirdos , don't answer their questions.  maybe if less people answer them then Y!A will have to make an abortion section for them, or they will stop asking these questions.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	They should be asked in woman's health.
DvWGTzLUaa	I'd personally say that's selfish. When you have a baby you take on everything that comes with it. That includes romantic holidays for 2! You can still have a nice holiday with the baby. If you wanted to enjoy being free and young you shouldn't have gotten pregnant. Sorry to sound harsh but that's just the way it is.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Once the baby comes your views may change.<br>  <br>  You can have a life, get a babysitter and go out twice a month or something, but I don't think leaving your kid for a vacation is the best idea. You can always get a second room and bring the baby and a babysitter... or wait till your child is a few years old.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	yes you can still have a life after you have a child. as long as you have a good support system and people you trust to babysit for you. a vacation is due able but don't start planning yet because a lot of moms (especially first time moms) have a hard time letting their children go to a babysitter, family member , anyone for a long period of time (even a short period of time). i know a couple people (even saw one or two on here) who plan vacations and then stress over leaving their kids.|`|DcLiW4bbaa	Sure you can have a life.<br>  <br>  I just had a baby two months ago, and last weekend for the first time since I got pregnant I went out clubbing with my friends and it was great. (I'm 21 btw). I've also gone out to dinner, went to the movies, and my boyfriend (baby's father) goes to bowling league every Sunday.<br>  <br>  But when I do go out I end up missing my baby girl and can't wait to get home to her, even though I do enjoy some time alone. So I think you might find that even though having a social life is great, most of the time you'll just want to be with your baby or bring your baby with you anyway so it's not a big deal.<br>  <br>  As for a vacation... I don't think I could stand to be away from her that long, lol. But I suppose everyone is different. As long as you have a reliable sitter (grandparents are the best ;) ) I don't think it would be a problem.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You may want that now, but wait until you first meet your baby. Then you will never want to leave their side when they are that young. I never left mine when they were babies. I was too scared to leave them with anyone. I could see getting away for a couple of hours because you need a break, but a couple days is too much when they are that young. That is your time to bond with your baby and get to know them.|`|AA11481889	You think that now....but you might want to reserve judgment on this topic until after you meet your child.<br>  <br>  I had the same concerns while I was pregnant...and then i had the baby and realize that there was no way I was ever leaving his side.<br>  <br>  It's been almost two and a half years and we haven't spent a night apart.<br>  <br>  *********************<br>  <br>  On the other hand...I have a cousin who dumps his kids on his 80 year old mother almost every weekend and goes on vacations all the time without the kids...so...<br>  <br>  I guess it really just depends on you.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	of course you can. be careful what you are commited to though because you may change your mind about being without your LO. My son is 14 months and I have only spent 1 night away from him... I have to spend one more in 3 weeks and while I'm totally looking forward to it I'm also really dreading it. I couldnt imagine going away for a vacation... its very possible and completley do-able but you might not want to!|`|7ax0vlFIaa	The new baby is now part of your new life. That doesn't mean you won't have a life after having a child, that means that now your life will have a new meaning. Take a little vacation now and then, in the summer, take another vacation with the baby. Right now you're probably having many thoughts about how your life is going to change. However, I really think you should think of these changes as good ones because there is not one bad thing about having a child. Get ready to start a new life, one that's more full of joy. Take advantage of being by yourself now, but then when your baby is born, make sure they become a part of your new life. Where you go, they go. Really, it's not a bad thing!|`|RcchpBX5aa	If your asking this your probably not mature enough to have a child.... but the answer is yes, you can have a life after having a child. As a matter of fact, you'll have a better life because babies bring so much joy into the world. You sound kind of selfish like you think your child is going to ruin things for you..... I pray for the sake of your child it's just a bad choice of words...|`|5DP859Gxaa	I have 2 kids. I am not able to live my life to the fullest,but I make due with what I got.<br>    Yes it is good to get away for a while but I don't recommend leaving until after the baby is at-least 6mths or older. <br>   The first 2 mths. of the baby's life is very crucial, to bond with both parents and vice versa.
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I got the replacement parts 2 weeks after calling. I called at 3am when they first did the recall and left a voice mail with my name, address ,and crib model number.<br>  <br>  *edit to A_McShay... you can't sell something that is re-called. Doing that doesn't fix the problem it just changes to another person.|`|14JQ11AUaa	I would return the cribs and buy one from Graco!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: Maybe sell it, craigslist maybe? Use that money towards a new crib! That is what I would do :)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I HATE them! The first crib I wanted I ordered from them. Well they sent the wrong one. In addition to that it was missing parts and was all chipped. I sent it back and then the one I originally wanted was out of stock. So I got my money back and ordered a Graco. Thankfully too because I just saw that the one I tried to order got recalled and they all had to be returned! I'm happy with my new purchase and I'm sorry for what you're going through. Hope they reach you soon. I also had problems with their hotline. I'd call back and keep at them.|`|YTYrg3qlaa	scare them when they answer the phone, tell them you're gonna report them or something.. they cant be doing that to people..|`|nDSWuQ7Raa	i ordered my bracket about 3 weeks ago and was starting to wonder where they are too.. figure they would be on top of something like this
f68cbd69ab1cba1c29f33d69ed58c6b2aa	That is a little creepy...|`|pXSKSS3daa	It wasn't simply because of his name. Do you know his sister's middle name? Aryan Nation.<br>  <br>  Their parents are crazy and those poor kids deserved to be taken away.|`|bRAmXcowaa	i dont think the name is the reason that they removed the child. the swastickers, unlicenced fire arms, kkk activity, arian nation activity and general attitude of the parents is the reason the child was removed. The name just gave them away|`|KSq8DXlfaa	I feel bad for the kid! Even though it's just a name, the connotations of it make it kinda more than just that. The parents are psychotic! Did you know that one of his sisters' middle name is "Aryan Nation"? Wow his parents are sick... it's kind of sad that he was taken away from his parents, but maybe it was "good" if their name choices suggested that they had something scarier going on hidden under that? Poor children; regardless of whether the authorities did the right thing or whether their parents are really neoNazis and not just crazies who give their kids awful names, the children got caught up in all of this!=(|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I feel bad for that child. I'm sure his parents made a big deal about it in front of him too. From what I have heard his siblings have names that "represent" (for lack of a better word) racism. <br>  <br>  The store should have made the cake- he didn't pick his name! Why punish the child because his parents are ignorant?|`|q5Ie2j8Aaa	child protective services do not take children away just because of a name.<br>  <br>  this is, however, a red flag for CPS to investigate the environment to determine whether the child is in danger.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	strange name choice and unfortunate for the little guy but its not his fault... he should still get a birthday cake!|`|dW4DbkCLaa	That cannot be true. The parents had to be doing something to endanger their child for the authorities to take him from them. Even though Adolph Hitler is an awful thing to name a child, it's not illegal. There had to have been more going on.|`|D9WvoaoEaa	well, i'm pretty sure that's the parents' fault.. i mean really... why would anybody name their child after someone so......................................... evil! yeahh, that's the word..<br>  poor little boy though..<br>  no bday cake :(<br>  and it's not even his fault!<br>  but to answer ur question, no.. i haven't heard about this.. it's interesting though.<br>  hope i helped! :]|`|BM6veAseaa	yes i have heard the story, and it is a family in new jersey.  I can understand the grocery store denying the cake, but I din't know the child was taken away from the family.  That may be too extreme a reaction.|`|WPI0Z47saa	They didn't take him away because of the name. It was because they were teaching him to be hateful and racist and that was endangerment.|`|VR5dGg4taa	I'd make him a cake that says happy birthday...but i definitely would not write the name adolph hitler....those parents have no idea how much crap that kids gonna get when he's older for having that name....it's sad, really..|`|3ZH3BUSYaa	Yeah.<br>  And they didn't give him the cake because of the name.<br>  Parents said that they only named him that because they knew that NO ONE else in the world would name their child Adolph Hitler.|`|X8Q1zXaMaa	Yes, but their daughter's middle name was Aryian Race, which kind of shows that they may be Nazi worshipers.|`|RQkp7XrJaa	I'd buy a cake for little Adolph, It's not the kids fault.|`|gp2XE6zqaa	Wow. Cruel, cruel parents. I mean what were they thinking! What do they think that child is going to do the rest of his life. Didn't they think of how that would affect him rather than being selfish and naming him that because they "liked it"? You just don't do that. What are the chances that they would have named him that if there wasn't already the infamous Adolph Hitler. It is wrong that the store denied them though. That's pretty much unconstitutional.|`|qRwykCMoaa	well first of all you have to be sick to name your child that. but i do think it's stupid to deny writing the name on a birthday cake. all i have to say is that the parents should be ashamed and if i was that little boy i would change my name when i turn 18.|`|KCS862Qaaa	Its a good ******* reason not to give him a cake.

8jlOGOAeaa	This sounds so bad, but I need to just rant a bit about my friend's parenting skills. She's usually a good mom, but I don't know what the heck is going on....<br>  <br>  She has an almost 3 year old and a 5 month old. The 3 year old girl was recently diagnosed with epilepsy (she got it from my friend). The bad part is that her daughter had been showing signs since she was 8 months, and she just over the last month took her in. She is now on medicine twice a day, which makes her a bit sleepy. My friend delayed giving her the medicine for two weeks because she didn't want her to "act weird" during the holidays!! Next, her daughter got this crazy cough (back in January) and after I mentioned numerous times that it sounded awful, she finally took her to the doctor yesterday...and she has bronchitis and asmtha. Along with breathing treatments and an inhaler, she was also prescribed some decongestant. My friend, this morning, gave her double the dose because she "only glanced at the instructions".<br>  Her son, who is 5 months, is wearing a helmet until he is 8 months because she allowed his head to go completely flat in the back. It was so bad that the doctors did a MRI just to make sure the brain wasn't being comprimised. He's supposed to wear it 23 hours a day, but she only puts it on him MAYBE 8 hours. Now, after a round of vomitting and bloody bowel movements, the doctors think he has salamenella....<br>  <br>  I know some is out of her control, but she calls me everyday to talk about all of this...ugh. Thanks for the rant...LOL. I think my husband and mom were getting tired of me complaining to them...hehe.|`|sSRHQkROaa	i was at the wic office picking up some checks and this young mother (she had to be 17 or 18) kept leaving her son (he was about 8 months or so) in the wic office. she left once to get some food and then again to talk on the phone.

The nurse smelt cigarette smoke on her and got on her for smoking before the test. Always nice to see a pregnant mom smoking. Then a little later I see her in the waiting room and I notice she has a black eye. Next she gets out a bottle and adds water and one of those Crystal Light to go packs to it and gives it to her son who couldn't be any older than 2 years old.  What is wrong with people?|`|YmEGCGtnaa	well a lady i talked to at the park today, who said she had put in the swings i put my baby in i guess she works for the city or something, said they got the carousel (the park kind) removed b/c too many parents tried to sue bc their toddlers were getting injured with the bigger kids. well, they shouldn't have let their toddlers on with bigger kids in the 1st place! or they should have been watching them!<br>  that story is just awful. what was she thinking??<br>  <br>  and actually, linedancer inspired me lol---my friend kinda gets on my nerves with her parenting. she feeds her baby WHIPPED CREAM twice a week, she never bathes her baby and makes her husband do it, NOT ONCE has she bathed her OWN baby, and she is too afraid to drive so she wont ever take her baby anywhere not even for walks when shes at home all day with her. I agree driving with a baby is scary esp. with today's crazy drivers, but c'mon---to a nearby park? gimme a break. or she could at least walk to a park but she doesn't even feel safe doing that. it just gets on my nerves how she depends on her husband for EVERYTHING when it comes to their baby---i mean, what about when her baby's older and dad's at work and she really wants to go somewhere/ Is she going to tell her "mommy's too afraid?"<br>  <br>  oh, and she feeds her baby's cow's milk on a regular basis basically just giving it to her like formula, her baby's almost 13 mons, yet shes not on any steady diet. she hasn't even moved past purees yet. i've been trying to encourage her to give her table food, my friend is so CLUELESS but she just depends on her HUSBAND to just save the day.

They walked around for a few minutes and since the mom was carrying the baby, dad was holding all the clothes and picking anything the mom wanted to try on off the shelves. I was in the back of store with them and I was just browsing through the sales racks when the lady put her baby down on the floor and WALKED AWAY. I'm not talking put the baby down and stepped 2 feet away, I'm talking walked to the other side of the store and left the baby in the middle of the floor near me.<br>  <br>  I just kind of stood there with my mouth open in shock. There weren't a lot of people in the store and there was only 1 entrance and exit, but really? Are you THAT lazy? What if I was  a crazy person who wanted to kidnap the lil' guy?

Some are better than others, but private school is generally superior.|`|4NQbNjxVaa	I think that if you live a good school district then there is no reason to send your kids to a private school, unless they are like super geniuses and the public schools don't have the programs that they need. <br>  <br>  Homeschooling (in my opinion) is the worst thing you can do. You have to work really hard to get the normal social skills everyone else gets just by going to school. <br>  <br>  And finally I'm a senior in high school and I got into great colleges without going to a private school. So I guess it all comes down to what kind of environment you want your child learning in.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i might consider a private school but it would have to have a grounded social aspect aswell. not some rich snobby school. i think that that money could go to something else though. you can get a great education in public schools and use the saved tuition for post secondary or something else substantial in a chil'd life.<br>  <br>  i should add that the public schools where i live (BC Canada) are great!|`|lKsgF8bOaa	If I could afford to, I would defiantly send my children to a private school... not just any private school, but a school which I like the curriculum of.

Plus it's more simple and simplicity is sometimes the most beautiful. You might want to go with a more simple middle name as to not take the focus off of the first name! You don't want a middle name to be stronger or even equal to the first name, that's kind of like having two first names!

8eGrFwXQaa	no it's normal, each baby is different and has different sleep patterns.  My little boy is a night owl and I'm 37 weeks tomorrow so the movements are pretty apparent and hard to sleep through as well.  Good luck!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	Babies are rocked to sleep in the day time because of your movement. It is completely normal for you to notice it more once you lay down because you are more aware and less distracted and notice the movement more. Enjoy it. I am due aug 15th and only feal movement once in a while and it is not often yet. I can not wait!!!|`|nyuB4POqaa	my baby barely moved through out the day, but as soon as I was ready for bed she'd be bouncing all night long. <br>  It didn't keep me up though, because I found it very relaxing,|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's normal. This one I'm pregnant with,it moves during the day more and not so much at night.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	It's definitely normal for your baby to move more at night. Your movements during the day will rock it to sleep.<br>  <br>  I've heard of some women "teaching" their babies to sleep at night by laying down during the day when they are pregnant. That way, when you're ready to sleep at night, your little one might be more tuckered out and willing to sleep when you're trying to sleep, too.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	Some babies are more active at night, and some babies aren't. The fetus has it's own sleep/wake cycle. For example near term the fetus is usually active for about 35 minutes and then sleeps for about 20 minutes. You probably notice the movement more at night because you are in bed or more still. During the day you are too distracted by normal daytime activity. Also Ice and cold drinks stimulate fetuses. At this point in your pregnancy the fetus has a lot of room as it is still small and is naturally curious about it's new environment. All of this is very normal. By 30 weeks or so the fetus will slow down immensely. Happy trails|`|WecTdlZ5aa	Get used to that!! It's definitely normal!<br>  <br>  I've heard that during the day when you are up & moving that it sort of rocks the baby to sleep.<br>  <br>  Nothing to worry about!|`|3w7VztEWaa	I can never sleep anymore I'm til 4 in the morning and my baby only moves later in the night I hardly ever feel my baby during the day.|`|sSRHQkROaa	no it's normal, my baby moved a lot at night, he doesn't do it too much anymore though.

Oh my suggestion would be the anti makeover pick out really ugly or out dated clothes from goodwill paint there faces with terrible colors and go to the moive its so much fun|`|XmwxAeabaa	Well, I was actually wanting an answer myself! Im not boring, but i have woods in my backyard, and i love being outside. So, me and my best buddies are going out hicking and for a picnic. Really relaxing! Also, go out to eat, then bowling, then sleep, then you could, idk, bake and decorate some cupcakes! :)
4t5eGShiaa	First of all.. congrats!<br>  <br>  I have really weird cramps when I first got pregnant.. (that's what triggered me to take a home pregnancy test) Well.. I went to the doctor because I was afraid I was miscarrying... He reassured me that everything was fine, and explained that the cramps are your bodies way of telling you there is a "foreign" object in your body.<br>  <br>  My cramps went away after about week 12 of pregnancy. And now I have a very healthy and active 6 month old!|`|GLJkGgloaa	Hey, I am about to turn Five weeks and I am having the same thing. Cramping and Back ache. My Body is getting ready to grow baby.<br>  As long as there is no Major pain or bleeding, you should be fine.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Early pregnancy can be similar to period symptoms. Once you get a few more weeks along, those should go away. I dont know if ectopic can be detected by the blood test, but mention it to your doctor if your're concerned.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	I know it's hard not to sometimes but try not to worry too much. I had terrible cramps around the time my period was due to the point where I thought I was going to start at any minute. Eventually they did lessen to a dull cramping. It is normal due to your uterus growing and stretching for baby. I'm 8 weeks pregnant right now and I still get cramps on and off. <br>  <br>  As for an ectopic pregnancy, the cramping would be severe and you would feel shoulder pain(left sided), along with bleeding, dizziness, and feeling faint.|`|fNE7Q7e8aa	hi there,<br>  <br>  The cramping can be caused by your uterus stretching<br>  to make some more room for your growing baby.<br>  My doc told me not to worry unless it's severe or you're<br>  bleeding.<br>  Backache is pretty common during pregnancy as well.<br>  <br>  Yes I've had menstrual-like cramps myself but<br>  my baby is totally fine:)<br>  <br>  The ultrasound scan will tell you if it's normal pregnancy or<br>  ectopic pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy, and best of luck!!|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	its probably just the cramping from the uterous stretching. it has a lot of growing to do for the baby and fluid and placenta!!|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	The embryo may be implanting.  I had horrible cramping and some bleeding at 6 weeks.  I thought I was miscarrying, but it was just implanting.<br>  <br>  I don't think a blood test can diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, but here are some symptoms.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2071948_diagnose-ectopic-pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2071948_diagnose...</a><br>  <br>  "Know the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy. These may include vaginal bleeding, nausea and vomiting, lower abdominal pain and cramps, pain only occurring on one side of the body, dizziness, weakness, fainting and pain in the rectum, neck or shoulders. Should you experience any of these symptoms, particularly early in your pregnancy, call your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room. Do not delay treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy can cause severe blood loss for you. You may also experience impaired future fertility."  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|PTLXDmG4aa	i had cramping at 5 weeks.. not severe but i put it down to it just being my uterus stretching.. <br>  a few days before my period was due to start it felt like i had mild period pain, obviously it wasn't.. talk to your doctor if you are worried, but if its not severe, just noticable you may jst be in the same boad as i was.. im pretty sure ectopic would be extremely severe.. but im not a dr|`|IIY9KPnZaa	i had quite a bit of cramping in the beginning.. its just your body making room... <br>  i dont believe an ectopic shows up on a home test.. not sure tho.. thats just what ive heard... and if it was ectopic your cramps would be very painful (not even considered cramps) and they would most likely be on one side or the other not in the middle.. i wouldnt worry too much.<br>  if you are concerned tell your doctor and maybe they could do an ultrasound to be sure.
n6XYYyoLaa	u need to talk to your doc asap; there could be a medical reason she isn't eating enough, early teething, reflux, etc.....best to make sure ....<br>  i am sure they will be concerned if she's not gaining weight..

Put him in his bed, and shut the door tell him if he comes out, then he cannot do (something that he does usually that is somewhat rewarding)<br>  Its your house not his you wear the pants in the family so control your household!
maSZlX5Yaa	Ooh ooh ooh! that's ME you are talking about!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Sure.  He wouldn't bring his head if it weren't screwed on.  You're handling it like we have, but as you may know, forgetfulness and losing things is a major symptom of ADD.  Both my husband and my son have it.  The jury's still out on whether or not I do. :)<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I was SO like that in high school, my parents used to get so pi$$ed at me for stuff like that.  Really it lasted until I was about 20, i started just being more responsible and taking pride in things I do.  I was tired of being careless.  I would leave things at all kinds of places and never get them back, so I started to be more aware of what I was doing on my own.  I think maybe its just a teenager thing.  My brother is 17 and he's forgetful too now.  He doesn't go very many places, but things like putting his laundry in the dryer, or taking out the trash *he knows he's supposed to do it EVERY FRIDAY*....I'm having my kid any day now,and I expect he will be like that when he gets to be a teen.|`|40df03363b52ed42b15153ae7ab46849aa	I am like this, and your children might have A.D.D. (Like I do.) A.D.D. can make children extremely forgetful, and I would take them to have an interview with their doctor about it.|`|YW74O9aNaa	My kids are very little now but i remember i had many friends who were losing things all the time! There are hundreds of other things on their mind  and taking care of their belonging is never!<br>  <br>  So its pretty normal and many kids and for that matter adults do that :)<br>  <br>  My 6 yr old hasn't left anything at kindergarten yet :) I am myself very organised person and if don't find things in place i am annoyed. <br>  And i'm sure if my kids end up being so careless i'd be very irritated. <br>  <br>  Yes, there is no solution but to make them realise there will be consequences and they'll be more careful. <br>  <br>  Some get better with age, especially when they start earning and know what it takes to pay for stuff :) but then again some remain equally forgetful even when they're old !

7ck7boGhaa	Developmentally Delayed is a nice way of saying the child will probably be mentally retarded but we dont want to call it that until they are 8. Sorry to seem harsh but as a Special Ed teacher I think you should know what you are getting into. 98% of all Developmentally delayed children end up being labeled Mentally Retarded later on in life. Now since she had a low birth weight she could be in the 2% but be prepared for a lifetime of Special Ed meetings. Mentally retarded does not mean she could not get a job and have a normal life it just means she will have an IQ below 70. I hope I have not discouraged you to much I just dont think its fair that no one at the adoption agency has explained this to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|iKBbewpYaa	that could be why too because she was so young when she had the baby and her body wasnt even done growing or another thing the people who were taking care of her before you could have not laid her on her stomach enough and that is what helps them  to start crawling . but she might have somthing wrong with her.. some babies that are born premature or low birth weight have a different brain development and are sometimes a little slower at doing things like a regular 10 month old. hopefully shes fine|`|sNJ7uHPMaa	my baby weighted 3lbs 10 oz when she was born. she is now a year old and one week old and doing just fine. i don'tt think it has to do withbirth weightt. im thinking its because the mother was so young her bodywasn'tt ready to make a healthy baby. but who knows babies grow at different speeds. it could just be that she is not yet ready to crawl. my daughters not walking yet. and she is over a year old. she will be alright. :)|`|bzAV03kbaa	ged her to a neurologist right now. If you were able to adopt, you have insurance.  take her now. make an appointment right now.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I don't know if low birth weight contributes to slow development, but I do know that premature babies and babies born to mother who smoke/drink/live unhealthy lifestyles can definitely lead to slow development.<br>  <br>  Also, 10 months with no signs of crawling isn't too bad. I know a couple of babies who didn't crawl until 11 months and walk until 18 months. So give her time.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	low birth weight didn't cause her developmental delay, it is another symptom. keep your eye on her. yikes, 12? i wouldn't be surprised if something else is going on with her.
AA10468184	You could tear your cervix which means a surgical procedure to stitch you up, you could also swell your cervix so much that you won't be able to push the baby out and wind up with a c-section...|`|hAXJ47iAaa	The reason they tell you to wait until your fully dilated is for this reason, (as told to me by my midwife)...If you push against a cervix that is not fully opened...it can swell...which would dely your labor...OR if you do manage to push your baby down some...the cervix could still begin to close around the baby...god forbid on its neck or chest etc...So they have a good reason for you to wait. I know its hard! Especially when they keep saying just breathe!  Not so easy when its basically uncontrollable!|`|gMxseQBCaa	I work in OBGYN and the previous posters are correct. You would tear if the baby didn't have adequate room to descend. Now this wouldn't be the case if you were having a very small baby. 10 cm is the recommended dilation to allow baby's to be born. Of course there are always exceptions. If you pushed at 9.5 and you were having a 5 lbs baby, i'm sure you would be fine.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	You would tear, probably a lot, as the previous poster said. It's not giving your baby's head enough room to get out and by forcing the tissue, it would have to give way. <br>  <br>  FWIW I was completely dilated and felt no need to push.|`|vue9NOhYaa	At worst you could tear your cervix.<br>  <br>  Usually though it just tires you out for no good reason. YOu need to save your energy for useful pushing.|`|afeNK6oSaa	That's a good question.  My doctor with baby number one told me that would happen, and he said to push very gently and 'roll with those contractions' he had me doing visual meditation, and it brought allot of relief to do that...<br>  <br>  but I wonder if i had really pushed.  Interesting question.|`|7clS7baaaa	yes something would happen-youd have a tougher time birthing the baby (longer for the baby to be born), and more than likely you would tear....otherwise nothing would happen.|`|v3LnJycKaa	you can A swell your cervix making labor and delivery very difficult, and B you can tear your cervix.|`|pHAKN32yaa	u will tear ur outside vaginal walls. <br>  my friend pushed at 7-8 cms and she tore the rest of the way till the baby was out! that means she had stitches down there from where she tore.<br>  ouch!!!!!
miPubuDYaa	Just checking how you are doing/feeling. Check your blood pressure & weight. Might give you a sonogram. Might get a script for blood work. Its gonna be a doozy too. I stopped counting after 8 vials.<br>  <br>  Week 20 exam the doctor can check to see if its boy or girl<br>  Week 24 exam you have to go for your glucose test.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	Probably a sono, hopefully you'll be able to hear the heartbeat.  They will check your blood pressure, weigh you and check your urine.|`|MGGuYmAHaa	It's been a while since mine, but they will probably have you give them a urine sample just to make sure your not getting gestational diabetes, the Dr. will do some measuring around on your tummy, check your weight, and may check your blood pressure.  At that point the Dr. may also order some blood work to be done, they do this to check for possible birth defects and such, I believe they call it  marker test.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you buy the book "What to Expect When You Are Expecting", it is a wonderful book and takes you month to month on what transitions your body will be going through even down to the little stuffy nose most women get in the first tri-mester.  You should be able to find it at any bookstore or online.  It is so wonderful and answered so many of my questions with my first pregnancy.  Congratulations!|`|Rpg8Feg2aa	They will weigh you,you will have to pee for them again you will have to every time though and they'll check the heart beat of the baby and if you haven't had an ultra sound they might do one then.<br>  Good Luck<br>  GOD BLESS|`|bGRexKPyaa	Man! I'm 34 weeks.<br>  <br>  8 weeks???? Hmmm. If I remember right they will either listen to the babies heart beat with a portable thingy or they will look at the baby using the ultra sound. Right now ur baby is so tiny that the only thing you may be able to see is  yolk sack or the shape of its heart beat..<br>  <br>  Good luck mamas|`|lHjXeN8oaa	check your weight, blood pressure, and possibly listen for a heart beat or do an ultrasound to "date" you.  :)|`|AA10713742	From now on the doctor will always request a urine sample. <br>  <br>  The next appointment, you'll probably be able to hear the baby's heart beat with a Doppler. <br>  <br>  If the doctor gives it a go, then you can do an ultrasound.
z5JkgFOyaa	Taking a pregnancy test too soon after conception can, obviously, lead to inaccurate results. The most accurate results for a pregnancy test will not occur until after your period is due. Every pregnancy test that is on the market today are most likely to give you the most accurate results after this time. <br>  <br>  Because your periods are irregular and you don't know when your next period will be due, and if you have been working at conception for a while, it can be difficult to wait those extra days. You may want to try much earlier. If you do try earlier, don’t take a negative as an absolute that you are not pregnant. You can’t discount pregnancy until you get your period, so there is always hope, up until that point.<br>  <br>  One important thing to understand is that every woman’s body is different. The process of conception can, therefore, vary greatly from one woman to the next. On top of this, pregnancy can occur several days after conception. In some cases, it can be as much as a week after conception before the fertilized egg actually implants in the uterus, and the hormone hCG (Human Chorionnic Gonadotropin) starts to increase.<br>  <br>  This raises another point. It is important to understand how exactly a pregnancy test works. A pregnancy test will measure the amount of hCG that is in your system. As your pregnancy progresses, the amount of hCG in your system will increase. At 10 days past ovulation, for example, the average woman has an hCG measurement of right around 25 mIU. This amount doubles to 50 mIU at 12 days past ovulation, and then doubles again to 100 mIU at around two weeks past ovulation. Different tests have different levels of sensitivity; if you use a home pregnancy test that is sensitive to 100 mIU, it will not tell you that you are pregnant if your level of hCG is only 75 mIU.<br>  <br>  So, the bottom line is that you need to figure that implantation will take place around 3-7 days after conception (in your case if you ovulated on 26th). Beyond that, implantation will occur between 6 and 12 days after ovulation. So, the very earliest after conception that you could take a pregnancy test would be 9 days; and, you may not have an accurate reading on a pregnancy test until as many as 19 days after conception.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck :)
AA10254927	They'll go sweetheart. Be patient. <br>  <br>  I had an unplanned pregnancy myself and for a long time wasnt sure where we were headed. Being our 1st, even my hubby wasnt much help... he was confused himself. This ended up in us fighting a LOT!<br>  But then I accepted it as God's blessing and decided to go with it. midn u, I wasnt particularly happy still. Untill I heard my baby's heartbeat at the docs. That was it. All my doubts flew away and I knew I wanted this baby more than ANYTHING!! :)<br>  <br>  My key --<br>  * Pray. <br>  * Believe in yourself. <br>  * Make sure your hubby understands there's a lot of ups and downs in pregnancy. <br>  * Talk to a friend<br>  * Look around at people who want babies... cant make one! have to get IVFs etc done. Count it as a blessing!<br>  <br>  Congrats and Goodluck|`|8l1ayuJKaa	don't worry, i felt the same, but now i have a 13 year old daughter and i don't think i could be more happier. dont worry, but depending on how old you are, below 25 have some fun with your life, over, great time to settle down B-)|`|N6tTbsa4aa	No your hormones are going crazy and you just have to enjoy this.. don't think about an ugly body, but only about a healthy baby, you will get over that after your 20 weeks once you start feeling the baby kick.. good luck|`|bGRexKPyaa	Wait until your hubby gets back...<br>  <br>  Its the hormones.

Not that i didn't want any more children, but the timing was WAY off.  my husband was deployed (we are military) and had came home on R&R.  despite the pill, we still managed to conceive.  I had 3 little ones on my hands already and the pregnancy was a really rough one - lots of morning sickness.  Once i got past the first 6mos of throwing up and i started feeling the baby move and all i just kind of got used to the idea and decided it wasn't so bad after all.  :)  She is now 2.5 years old and i couldn't imagine life without her.  We love her to pieces.  so i am sure you will feel better about it once you get past the rough part of your pregnancy...  best of luck to you.|`|mAxChwHTaa	you are not a horrible person... when i found out i was pregnant i was really happy but the i had morning sickness so bad i wanted to die and i thought that i hated the baby for doing this to me... then i started thinking about what i would look like after.... i had my son on august 30, 2008 and i can honestly say that i was in my size 2's in a month and a half without working out a single time... ( i breast fed him and watched what i ate, plus if you watch what you eat during pregnancy you will be fine.) some women think when they are pregnant its an excuse to gain weight.. you are not eating for two your baby is so small that it doesnt need a cheeseburger of its own it needs like half a french fry :) you will be so happy when you have your baby that it will all be worth it... i love my son so much i cant imagine what i would do without him...|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	yes, it sounds to me like raging hormones.  try positive affirmations, meditation, things like that -- or anything that will help you keep a positive attitude and get that excitement back.  it's such a special thing to have a child, and the rewards are so amazing!!  i loved being pregnant (aside from the physical discomforts, of course) and now that my kids are grown, we're great friends!!<br>  <br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  oh and you might want to consider joining some sort of mom's to be support group or something like that.  maybe there's some sort of educational group at a local hospital?  that way, not only will you have other women/mom's to help with the excitement, you'll learn that you're not alone and that you're not the only one with these feelings.|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Its your hormones you'll be fine.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	Its completely natural to feel this way.  Both of my pregnancies were planned and I still felt like that on and off at the beginning with both.  Once you see your little baby on the ultrasound you will change how you feel.  I would talk to your husband about your feelings and ask him not to fight with you so much.  Tell him your really emotional and need his help more then ever.  I tell my husband to let me win a few of our fights even if he knows I'm wrong because it makes me feel worse fighting with him.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	hormones BIG TIME all the crappy early pregnancy symptoms will pass enjoy dont do something u may regret the rest of ur life just bc of hormones ... and clearly ur stressed so iam sure ur husband is feeling the same way that's probably the cause of the fighting u both have alot on ur minds... u should sit down and talk about what u 2 really want. do u want a baby right now? could u cope with having an abortion?<br>  and ur Body wont be ugly being pregnant is beautiful <br>  good luck|`|8RfmosODaa	You will get excited! I think its just hormones playing their part. Be Thankful that God has blessed you with a bundle of joy!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	What you are feeling is ok. The first trimester is sometimes hard bc your body is dealing with so many emotions and extra hormones. When I found out we were expecting our 4th child I was upset. We have a 13, 4 and 2 year old boys. My husbands daughter jsut graduated college so we didn't have that expense anymore. I had planned on going back to work full time, we just bought a new house big enough for all of us (now it isn't) we were already financially strapped, I thought, how can we do this. My last pregnancy was so hard on me, I was sick the whole time and didn't want to go through this again. Abortion was NOT an option for us either. T But we got used to the idea. Made a new financial plan, decided to just add on to the house and I quit working my part time job so that I could stay home and let my body take it a little easier this time. hen we went for an u/s bc I was spotting and they told me they couldn't find a baby or a heartbeat. They thought they baby had stopped developing and for me to expect a miscarriage.  Then I felt a tremendous amount of guilt for thinking I didn't want to be pregnant at first. And that somehow I was being punished for even having that thought. All I wanted was for my baby to be okay. Thank God it was. Now I am very excited to meet our little one and add to our family. Once that first trimseter is over, your emotions and thinking will be clearer. And once you see your baby on the u/s screen or hear it's heart beat and feel it moving inside you for the first time, all those doubts will go away. If you feel like these feelings are not going away like they should, talk to your Dr. They may have some suggestions for you.  Best Wishes.|`|nfu6LiVXaa	Yes, I went through the same, too, in the beginning. Mine were just mood swings and results of really bad morning sickness. It went away a week after my morning sickness subsided (wk 14). And now that I've had my 2nd ultrasound, I am more excited than ever. Trust me, ugly body after the baby will be the last of your worries (because I know that's something I can change with diet, exercise, determination). All I am worried about now is will I have enough time to get everything ready (shopping, prenatal classes, hospital pre-admission, etc), when should I start my mat. leave, healthy baby, support after baby - how are we going to manage the first week...<br>  <br>  Although my husband and I didn't fight, but there were days and nights when I avoided him on purpose...there were times when I just want to be left alone.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	It will be okay.  Just relax.  We all went through this.  And eventually you will be so excited and I guarantee that when you have that little bundle of joy that has unconditional love for you?, you will love every minute of it.<br>  Stretchmarks?  Use cocoa butter lotion.  The good stuff, not cheap stuff.  Helps in cutting down on stretchmarks.  My sister used it and she is again a size 7 after having her 4 children and no stretchmarks.  I hope everything gets better for you and your husband.  No child deserves to go through something horrific like a stressed marriage.|`|R8bXuLbTaa	Girl, this is normal I think.<br>  <br>  When I became pregnant I started hating my boyfriend and wished that I felt differently about abortion because I did NOT want to have a baby.<br>  <br>  But, after my first trimester everything changed. I think it was just my hormones because I love my man and my daughter (she is 16 mos now).<br>  <br>  It wasnt exactly a planned pregnancy and I was a sr. in high school so I was scared. But everything worked out perfectly.<br>  <br>  And about that body... just eat healthy and you will be fine. I gained a whopping 70 lbs with my baby but lost all my baby weight and then some within 6 months and i look even better then I did before. And guess what... NO stretch marks.<br>  <br>  Keep your chin up. Things will get better and you will fall in love with this baby|`|eGM2mzePaa	Dont worry hun ur feelings are NORMAL!! its just ur hormones you are probably feeling fat sick tierd and bloated!! who would like to feel like that?? but dont worry once u have u see ur baby u will realise it was all worth it bcuz u will have something u love more than life itself! <br>  Also if u are feeling unusually LOW or DEPRESSED see ur DOCTOR!

y4E8EoZ2aa	I am 16 weeks 1 day and I have gained 13 pounds so feel lucky! Haha....|`|kY8JTDD6aa	I went easily fluctuate from 109 to 115 so it's not that weird to go from 103 to 110 especially if it's at a different time of day.  Eat healthy foods, cover all the food groups, see your doctor/ midwife for checkups and don't worry about it.
keMiLz42aa	Did you get any answers from the men?   :-) <br>  <br>  Actually, it looks like you are in low in the weight gain chart. You seem to be 2 to 3 pounds below your healthy weight gain for 16 weeks. I was 105 lbs, 5'2, when I got pregnant, and now I am 130 lbs at 17 weeks... it seems like I have gained 25 lbs, but really it is not because i had to get myself to a healthy weight, mine was 115-120 lbs.<br>  <br>  105 lbs was too low for my height. Congratulations....|`|afeNK6oSaa	It depends on pre pregnancy weight.  I think as long as your getting about 2300 cals a day, your fine.  I gained weight a little faster with baby #2 and gained a little more weight over-all...because your body remembers the way it stored fat the first time, it is more efficient at it ;)<br>  <br>  Trust what your doctor says overall.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Wow, by my 16th week I had was at a 15lb weight gain. Keep in mind not every woman is the same, and not everyone will gain the same for each pregnancy. As long as you are eating healthy and your doctor isn't worried, you shouldn't be either. Some women gain 60lbs total and have 5lb babies. Some women only gain 20lbs and have 8lb babies. So it really depends on you and your body and baby's needs.|`|mAxChwHTaa	like 2 lbs.... i didnt show until i was 6 months.. but the second time i heard you gain weight much faster... talk to your doctor...|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I gained about 10lbs by 14 weeks but have stayed at that weight for the last 4 weeks.

vue9NOhYaa	You are normal, and so is your MIL. <br>  <br>  SOme women leak early. Some never leak at all.<br>  Some women leak a lot. Some just a little. <br>  <br>  Nothing to worry about.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Some women never do - including me. There is a wide range of normal as to when you might experience leakage.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Yeah, your mother in law is the abnormal one. Most women don't start leaking colustrum (your actual milk doesn't come in til after delivery) until close to or in the 3rd trimester, or even later. I'm 27 weeks and have leaked a little a couple times in the past couple weeks, but it barely started around 25-26 weeks.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy and good luck!!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Not every woman has to necessarily leak! It's not a required pregnancy symptom. I started leaking when I was around 24 weeks, and continue to leak off and on. I am now 34 going on 35 weeks and I have found that my leaking has slowed down a bit. If you don't leak at all or do start leaking later, I wouldn't be worried either way. Every woman's body is different, hormones, pregnancy, and symptoms all different.|`|iP863XM6aa	Some women never leak. I only started (im at 17 weeks) and thats only because my breast were hurting so i just decided to rub them a little. Anyways, i guess i put pressure somewhere near the nipples or something cause next thing i knew, i had liquid on my hands.<br>  <br>  But some never leak. I never leak on my own. Only if i touch them.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Most people actually don't, but for the people who do it could happen anytime during the 2nd trimester, but more likely in the 3rd trimester.  I really wouldn't be looking for it as it is not common.|`|IZTmipyaaa	I'm 39 weeks pregnant and i started to leak colostrum at 37 weeks. Colostrum is this watery substance that comes out before your milk does. I think 16 weeks is too early to leak.|`|3ZNf4ef9aa	Everyone is different! I was about 5-6 months with my first when I started leaking... this time I am not leaking at all - but my girl is still nursing... so... dont be worried!!!|`|kvAeV9GYaa	I never did until 3 days after giving birth.

277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	are you gunna be a stay at home mommy?  if not baby needs food at daycare.  most insurances cover most of the cost of a pump because they see it as a preventative measure to health for baby.  if they don't, they make some really good manual ones.   never did get an electric one.  manual ones are a take anywhere thing.|`|wURg3jBcaa	Well, technically you don't need one.<br>  <br>  I'm currently on maternity leave with my 3 month old, and breastfeeding, but I have found the need to pump every once in a while so I can get away for a couple hours- and my husband refuses to be left with the baby without backup.|`|68c6B8dRaa	It's totally unnecessary. The idea that these apparatuses are necessary is a very, very recent one.<br>  <br>  Useful: <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/is-pump-necessary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/is-pu...</a>|`|FLpMShKNaa	I don't think you need one. I had one because I work full time. Pumping is a giant pain in the tush, I was always relieved when the weekend came around, not just for the break from work but the break from pumping! That being said, if there could be situations once the baby is born where you are engorged, or cannot nurse for whatever reason and need to pump, if that happens go out and get an Avent Isis manual pump they are inexpensive and work very well if you don't have to express large amounts. You do not need it on a lost you cna get one at target or wherever.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You do NOT need one, though at some point you may want one.  However that being said the stores aren't going anywhere and neither are the breast pumps.  There's no rush to buy one before the baby is born, you shouldn't pump and use bottles until at least 4-8 weeks (and actually I never recommend bottles even if you do want or need to give the baby milk from a source other than your breast)<br>  <br>  If you do have severe breastfeeding problems at birth you will need to rent a hospital grade pump, a home use pump is not going to be good enough (BTDT)<br>  <br>  In a similar vein you don't NEED bottles, bottle nipples, or a bottle sterilizer.  You don't NEED breast pads (most moms never even finish their first box because they hate them and I think there's only 20-30 in a box?).  In a pinch you could use panty liners, kleenex, paper towels, hankercheifs, etc.<br>  <br>  You also don't NEED a swing, a bouncy chair, a rocking chair, a mobile, a play mat, etc, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/is-pump-necessary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/is-pu...</a><br>  A good breastpump is a wonderful tool to have available when it is needed, but not every mother needs a pump. In fact, even for those mothers who need to express their milk, manual expression is a good option (though it may not be the best option for a particular situation).<br>  Who needs a pump?<br>  <br>      * A mother whose baby is not nursing well (or not nursing at all). A quality pump is the best way to maintain milk supply in this situation.<br>      * A mother who needs to increase milk supply or is inducing lactation for an adopted baby. In these situations, a pump is not absolutely necessary but can certainly speed the process.<br>      * A mother who plans to return to full- or part-time work and wants to provide her milk for baby.<br>      * A mother who is planning occasional separations from baby for more than a couple of hours.<br>      * A mother who wants to offer expressed milk for other reasons.<br>  <br>  If baby is nursing well at the breast, then mom's need for a pump depends upon her plans for separation from baby. If you do plan to get a pump, the best kind depends upon how often you plan to pump. Here are some links on choosing and using a breastpump. If you plan to offer expressed milk, it's best to wait until baby is 4-6 weeks old.<br>  Are you pregnant and not sure whether you will need a pump?<br>  <br>  You always have the option of waiting until after baby is born and only getting a pump if you find you need one. In many communities, quality pumps can be easily found in local stores and rental pumps can be obtained from hospitals, pharmacies or lactation consultants.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	do you ever plan to spend a few hours away from home? or from your child? its not bad to give your child a bottle of breast milk once in awhile so you can go to the movie with hubby or out for dinner is it?|`|4KXA5oVtaa	Yes, you'll need one.  There will be times when your breasts are 'full' but your baby won't be hungry.  You can manually suppress your milk but this can be painful at times.  Also, if you ever go anywhere and leave your baby with a sitter you'll need to pump milk for a bottle while your gone.  There is also always a chance that you may get ill and require medication that won't be safe for the baby while breast feeding.  Having extra milk pumped and stored in a 'milk bank' is also a great way to stay prepared.  I would definitely invest in one!  Good luck!|`|deIzFnV8aa	A lot of people like to build up an emergency milk supply in case they ever need to be away or on medication.  Many hospitals give you a manual pump when you leave, and for pumping a few emergency bottles, that is probably sufficient.  It is certainly not a "must have" item, and even if you do want one, you probably won't do anything with it for the first month (nipple confusion worries), so you don't need to buy it before baby in any case.  Afterwards you might have a better idea of how you feel about things like wanting to have daddy be able to give a night feeding :P|`|iikdZKO7aa	It depends on your milk supply. When my milk came in I had so much that I couldn't even get my son on to feed. I spent three days having to express for around 15 minutes in each side before putting my son on to feed. <br>  Also, if you find that your milk supply is low you can express to help build up your supply. You don't neccesarily need to buy a pump though as there are plenty of places that hire them out.|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I think that's the BEST way to breastfeed--no bottles!  Most women find pumping to be an unenjoyable task.  It'll take some stress off you and baby if you don't have to worry about transitioning from breast to bottle.<br>  <br>  However, you may want to invest in an inexpensive manual pump for the following scenarios:<br>  <br>  1)  Your breasts are engorged and hard, and the baby is having a hard time latching on.  It may be beneficial to pump a little out for your own comfort and to take a bit of the pressure off.  Some moms find that baby can latch on easier after this.  However, there are other ways to achieve this (including hand expression).  Also, this would only last for a few days right after your milk comes in, so you could probably get by without one.<br>  <br>  2)  You want a date without baby.  This can be avoided easily enough too, but if there is a night you'd like to spend with just your partner, you'll be happy you have a pump.  I went to a wedding with my husband when my daughter was just a few weeks old, and by the time it was over I couldn't wait to pump.  I did it in the car.  (It was about an hour away so I couldn't hold on until we got home.)<br>  <br>  If you think you may need one for either of these scenarios but you're not going back to work, I'd recommend the Medela Harmony manual pump.  It's about $35, and features a version of Medela's two-phase expression technology.  Its reviews on target.com are very good, by the way--better than a lot of the electric pumps.  (See sources for link.)|`|pYyIkljBaa	I breast fed my 2 daughters and am nursing my 3 month old son right now. I did have an avent breast pump, which set me back over $100, which I never used. and ended up getting rid of it. I wouldn't be to worried about it. My recomendation is not to bother purchasing one until the baby is here, and if you feel like you need one, perhaps renting one from the hospital would be a good way to go before buying one.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	You may in fact not need one. Why not put the budget for it in the cupboard, and if you find you need it, pop out and pick it and a few bottles up.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I could have gotten away without my pump and bottles if I had to. Really, the only reason I used it is because I already had one. However, that was with my son. With my daughter the pump was very important.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|8a949c7984d501f70f4b690183ae5920aa	If you want to go out at nigth and want to have some back up milk and some bottles.  Your hospital may give you a hand pump when you give birth that was good enough for me!<br>  I used it to express milk for my sons cereal to add calories to his diet.|`|CN44WsTpaa	While I was pregnant with my daughter I felt the same way.  Why bother if I was going to stay at home and breast feed her full time?  But then there were those occasions that came up where I needed to go to the store to buy personal items but I didn't want to bring my one week old baby along.  Eventually I bought one and now I can leave the house knowing that she has enough milk for her next feeding.  And It really came in handy when my daughter started getting fussy at my breast and she would prefer a bottle.  Personally, I recommend one. You never know when it could come in handy.  You can just get a single instead of a double. A good one runs about 30 or 40 dollars at wal mart.
YFPMcHCbaa	Well answers from people on  here aren't always accurate either. Definitely take a test.
miPubuDYaa	Every person is gonna have an different opinion on what bottle to use. I prefere the Playtex drop in systems. They are so easy to clean and they reduce gas because you have to push the air out of the liner. Costco sells the liners in 2 100 pack boxes. Also Walmarts liners fit prefect but if you have long nails you could punchure a hole in it. (know from experiance.<br>  <br>  I know someone who switch from Playtex Drop-ins to the Avent with her third child. She swears that Avent bottle cause her daughter Austim from the BPA's that are in that bottle. Playtex is BPA free in most of their bottles. <br>  <br>  I will continue to use my drop-in after hearing her story.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.playtexproductsinc.com/infant/Playtex_Products_Statement.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.playtexproductsinc.com/infant...</a>|`|eD7qRBKHaa	I hated Avent.  They are really hard to position the top on so they don't leak!  All of my leaked terribly.  I still don't know what the trick was.  Playtex drop-ins were good, but those liners are expensive!<br>  <br>  I tried a few different ones, and I ended up switching to Soothies.  More hospitals use them than other brands, which was why I tried them, and they have been great.  They have never leaked, not even once.  Every part is dishwasher safe.  And they have a neat snapable one where you can snap formula or snacks in the container and snap it to the bottom of the bottle, so it all stays together.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	Whatever your baby prefers. I tried about 4 different brands before my baby decided he liked the ventair advance bottles. Now he's not picky, but when he first started drinking a bottle, he ONLY would drink out of those ones. I basically gave him a choice. I would buy one of each bottle, then give him each of them. I never bought a bunch of the same kind bottle until I knew which one he would take really well. Now our cupboard is FULL of ventair advance bottles! Some babies need different bottles or nipples. Just don't go buy a bunch of one brand if you're not even sure your baby will take it! Good luck!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i have had best luck with playtex dropins,there is less to work with,and convienient,but i was wanting to try new bottles from"nuby" they are to be avavilable in  march,they are suppose to be good for breast and formula fed babies....my sisterin law used both advent and dr,browns...advent was fine,the nipples are close to  the playtex ones but she said there was more work with the dr.browns.goodluck....oh ya...if you want to look at the nuby ones go to nuby.com...ill plan on trying one when they come out.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Breasts are the best baby bottles as that is what they are for, but after that I know that we liked drop in's, but some people do swear by Dr. Brown's.

If you are pregnant I would buy a few different kinds and see what your baby takes to. Good luck!|`|VdnAH78Xaa	i've used both.<br>  the avent you have to make sure you get the top on just righ so it wont leak. i like them because you can shake the bottle with the top on and it wont leak.<br>  the dr browns dont leak at all. but if i shake the formula up ith the top on, when i take the top off a little milk comes out. but i use this kind because it helps with gas a lot.|`|z6icOivVaa	My favorite was Playtex ones.<br>  I didn't go for formula but i pumped milk from my breasts.

A friend of mine that is around 17 weeks had to have an appendectomy done recently, and I remember her telling me they put her on morphine, but it didn't really work.<br>  <br>  You will be in my thoughts and prayers, as well as your baby boy!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Oh I am sorry that was such a ordeal, keep resting and I am sure he will stay in a while longer, You are probably just going have to get through the pain but I know your number one concern in the baby so stay hydrated and as relaxed as possible.|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	Oh my darling. I actually took breaks to read the whole thing, but I read it I promise.<br>  I've never been in a situation like this, but I'm so happy that you're baby is still hanging in there.

4KXA5oVtaa	My son had what seems to be very similar to your situation.  He'd be fine and then a fever, fine again the next morning, just to shoot back up at night.  This went on for nearly 2 weeks, with also the doctor finding nothing.  Believe it or not, our sons turned out to be a an intestinal problem.  He would pass what we thought was a normal amount but turns out we were wrong....however, fever's can be related to almost anything that ails a child.  From teething, which can go on forever, (my son also didn't get his first tooth till 18 months, go figure), to a viral infection, extreme exhaustion, cold or flu.  As long as your daughter doesn't have an extreme mood or appetite change, I wouldn't worry.  Just watch here every day functions of whats going in and coming out.  Good luck!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I think it's teething actually. If everything else had been checked, and she's acting happy enough...I'm sure it's the teeth. Just give baby tylenol for the fever and pain and see if that helps. Try teething tablets or a teething ring. As for measels I wouldn't worry if she had the vaccine and her doc said she was fine. So I'm going with a slight virus or teething. I'd take her back to the doc in a few days if it doesn't stop..or immediately if it gets too high.|`|6qCnpxrNaa	Likely (and hopefully), all is well but I would still be getting a second possibly even a third opinion on this.  If my infant had been running a fever for that long and there wasn't any definite cause found or change in condition I would be wanting to speak to another physician.  I pray for a quick recovery for your little one.  Good Luck and God Bless!

Now,if she actually had something wrong with it,and it was noticeable,then I might.|`|pcjOQDymaa	when she is 17 yea i would.<br>  1. because i hate my nose too but i dont really care<br>  so im not getting a nose job<br>  2. its her choice but i would make her do research and all that stuff.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	absolutely not. when she is 18 she can do what she wants but other then that no. not unless it was medically necessary|`|zhrGiQsKaa	only if it was affecting her breathing or she had a serverly distorted nose.|`|AA11481889	I don't think I would be encouraging plastic surgery for a child regardless of whether they could pay for it.<br>  <br>  If it was impairing her health ....then ok.<br>  <br>  If it was impairing her self esteem, I think want to focus on teaching her to love herself for who she is and teach her that plastic surgery is a slippery slope and that it isn't a cure all silver bullet to low self image.<br>  <br>  And I also think that 16 and 17 aren't ages where children are mature enough to determine what is for their own good.<br>  <br>  I think I would be more apt to have her contribute to her college tuition than pay for a rhinoplasty.<br>  <br>  <br>  ****************<br>  If it were my son...there would have to be some seriously freak show qualities in that schnazz before I'd ever allow someone at it with a knife...regardless of who was paying for it.|`|PTK2x59Kaa	nope after seeing all the stuff on the news about teens dieing in purley  non medical surgerys (like nose jobs and other things that arn't like medically  necsessary)  i especially wouldn't let her if it were to be her first surgery bc u just never know how shes gona react to the anethesia or anything and if she reacts badly the feeling that u would have knowing that u let her do it and it wasn't like a super important surgery to have, it'd be awful. Anyway its her nose and she should live with it.<br>  <br>  So my answere is no i'd never let a child of mine get a purley cosmetic surgery|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Probably not.  She can wait until she doesn't need my consent to do it.....Also, it depends, whats wrong with her nose?? Does she always get teased, or does she just not like her nose?  I might tell her that we'll see when she gets a bit older.  And in a couple of years she might not even want it anymore.  She can use that money to buy herself a car.|`|qWyZ94Iqaa	it depends. if you don't really care, then you should let her do it.<br>  but if you're against it, then i think you should tell her to wait until she's eighteen. one or two more years won't hurt. when she's a legal adult she's able to do whatever she wants.|`|vp1K0bxwaa	You posted this in the Adolescent category, teens are going to answer whether you like it or not.<br>  <br>  No, I would NEVER let my teen daughter get a nose job unless it was restricting her breathing from a break.|`|TGzOrftPaa	Have her wait the one year until she's 18 & then you don't have to worry about it.|`|lIQhB56Oaa	Not until she's 18 when she can start doing her own ****.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i know im a teen and you dont want my answer but at 14 i also had money saved up for a nose job.<br>  wait till shes 17 to make sure shes grown into her nose a little more. <br>  i would only let her get it if she has a bad nose that winds up making her face uglyer than it is ( a pointy nose, wide nostrals , ect.)<br>  then talk about it again when shes 17 and grown into it a little more.<br>  its somthing that will boost her self confidence make her feel better about herself and not like the ugly duckling.<br>  <br>  its somthing you and her father need to talk about with her. and take it into  deep concideration and talk to her about why she really really wants it.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	no way in hell... she can wait till shes 18. her nose is still growing and her body has not proportioned itself to her yet.. if she had one now her face will still change and she might not like it later... if she wants to have it when she is 17 she can wait one more year.. why doesnt she spend that money on something normal 16 and 17 yr old girls would spend that on. like a car, college, an apartment to move out at 18.|`|ea1YKhV9aa	no way tell her she is too young and tell her that the plastic surgery might go bad and her nose will look all messed up. her nose is probably fine and make sure to tell her she looks beautiful the way she is<br>  <br>  try to talk her into saving the money for college|`|VbdBxVLvaa	Yes, absolutely!  I say do it while you're young.  It's one of the best decisions I ever made.  It did so much for the way I looked at myself.  I didn't do it until I was about 23 though, I wish I had been able to do it earlier.  Make sure you do extensive research on the surgeons and make sure the plastic surgery thing doesn't develop into a habit.  If my daghter comes to me when she's older and truly wants this done, and I think she will benefit from it, It will be a hard thing, but I will let her do it because I personally understand where she is coming from.  If there is nothing wrong with her nose and it's a cute little button nose, then, No way!
pXSKSS3daa	When she shows signs of needing more formula. There is no set age for it. If she's hungrier then give her more, if not then don't.|`|A89ezcg5aa	Well, if she will take 8 oz., then I'd give it to her that much least half the day.  She's not too young for 8 oz. at this point, although most babies I've taken care of don't start taking 8 oz until 7-8 months.  But all babies have different appetites.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	When you think she is still hungry after her usual bottle. My daughter used to cry when she was finished her bottle because she wanted more and then I'd increase by 1 fl.oz. at a time until she stopped cryin after bottles. Sometimes it onl took a 1 fl.oz. increase.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	You can try and see if she will take it. If not then just wait a bit. My son was about 8 months before he would take 8oz and sometimes he would leave an ounce or two behind.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	We started at 6 months. :)|`|83nHy2PXaa	is she hungry for 8 oz? watch for her signs...|`|WlU3NFu6aa	When she starts taking 6 oz and wants more. My daughter didnt drink 8 oz until she was almost one. she drank only 3-4 oz at a time until she as about 8 months old
bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Water birth is amazing.  I don't think that you'll need the gas if you're having a waterbirth.  Water is the next best pain reliever to the epidural.<br>  <br>  Ahh, almost everyone poos during labor.  I did with my second, and the midwife's assistant just scooped what was there.  You're pretty cleared out from early labor.|`|ytE1q20taa	I'm trying to decide on water birth or normal birth with an epidural and gas and air, but after reading Mona K's answer I'm swaying more towards the water birth.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Our hospitals don't do water births.  Actually I've never heard of any that do...  Most want you flat on your back hooked up to all their contraptions.  If you want to research a water birth perhaps you could speak with a midwife.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	There has been a case where the baby drowned.<br>  Why not have a birthing chair.  Grevity will help, instead of ( when you are lying down) getting in your way. <br>  I had a birthing chair for my last birth  - it was very fast. <br>  Ask a midwife where you can borrow one.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I am planning on the water birth, there is alot to be said for calmly bringing your baby into the world in surroundings that are as close to those in the womb as possible. Good luck.|`|xUBmPeObaa	hold your breath.|`|5IfejIuraa	Hi there, I had a waterbirth 9 weeks ago when my daughter was born. It wasn't actually planned but when I was in labour in the night I found being in the shower really helped, so when I got to hospital the midwife suggested using the pool. I used a TENS machine at home and this helped so much that I was already 9cm dilated when I got to the hospital. Then I just got in the pool and the water was so calming and lovely that I didn't need any other pain relief, not even gas and air. I'm not boasting, just amazed at the pain relieving qualities of water. It was a very lovely experience and the water made me feel so light so I could change positions really easily which made things easier. I would definitely have another one and definitely recommend it. The water didn't get dirty, as I thought it would. Anyway, I don't think you'd notice!<br>  Good luck, whatever you decide!
vJ0j5rRLaa	It's called cramps! <br>  Tell her to relax, she isn't pregnant.|`|AA10084323	Very unlikely.  Especially if the period came on time.  Pregnancy usually doesn't occur that late in the cycle.  Next time, be careful!!!!!|`|17ixPSQQaa	She can still be pregnant and have a period, but it wont be like a normal period it will be light and end way to early. If she has a normal period then your pretty much safe.|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	No she can't.<br>  Having a period means you're releasing unfertilized eggs from your womb, as they're not needed.<br>  If she's pregnant, her eggs are fertilized, therefore, there will be no bleeding.
1VOsRV8Maa	YES! You absolutely made the right choice! Your ex bf is a selfish prick who doesn't deserve you or you child! I think it is a big thing to make a decision to keep this baby, and you're right! Why punish an innocent child for your own actions. You did the right thing. The next right thing to do is NOT put his name on the birth certificate, and take him for all he has in child support! He can't win! He won't win either! His actions can and will be termed in court as reckless abandonment! You go girl! You're a super woman! Taking care of yourself, a baby, and getting what you need from a lousy excuse for a man. God bless you and baby! Don't cry yourself to sleep anymore! This man and his actions don't deserve your tears! You will have a baby! A little human being who will love you unconditionally, and will need you endlessly! What a blessing! God bless you and good luck!|`|7xit1ogxaa	I think that you made a wonderful choice. This is exactly what motherhood is about, making sacrifices for your child. You are going to be a great mom.<br>  <br>  Edit: Your baby can have your last name, you don't have to give your child his name. After your child is born you need to have a DNA test done and get child support from his sorry ***.|`|AA10186411	YES, you made the right choice.  You sound like you will be a wonderful mother.  You don't need some stupid man to make you. My daughter's father left after I refused abortion as well.  They are nothing but ignorant little boys.  Just leave him be.  You wouldn't want that kind of person around your child anyway!  DON'T put his name on the birth certificate, and don't give him/her your ex's last name. <br>  <br>  Good luck!  And email me if you ever need advice! :)|`|v3LnJycKaa	you poor thing, but if he moved in with a chick that fast there is a good chance she was around before you got pregnant. never make a choice based on someone else saying they wont be there, he doesnt deserve you or the blessing you are carrying. As for him, contact a family lawyer, you can also walk into your family court and file for child support, start now, that way there is no delay and if you owe money to the hospital for the birth he is resonsible for half as well, give them his last known address, they will find him ... I wouldnt worry he will be responsible for the life he created one way or another, and they will perform a DNA test at the hospital if he so asks for one, and even if he signs the birth cert you do not have to give your child his last name, that is a right only given to married men, men who do not marry their childs mother leave that right to them... :) best of luck and if you need an ything you can reach out tome.|`|pHAKN32yaa	Everything happens for a reason! God gave u this baby as a gift!<br>  Don't worry about the father. The state has SOOOO much stuff u can apply for to get assistance and I gaurantee ur going to need it!|`|afeNK6oSaa	You made the right choice...wait till you see how much you love that baby.  There is nothing better in all of creation :)|`|gPg7qYGIaa	your making the right decision i love my baby so much and u will love yours once baby's born contact child maintains so that he will have to pay lol|`|7KEW7fxxaa	Yes you made the right choice and I would absolutely take him to court for child support. He knew the chances of something happening when yall were together and he is responsible no matter what. You are doing a good thing my brother was given his first daughter when she was 6 weeks old and the mom has nothing to do with her and she is now 8. If you go to court for child support they will tell you if you have to give the baby his last name. If he isnt at the hospital to sign it, I dont believe that the baby can get his last name.|`|7clS7baaaa	Indeed you did do the right thing by keeping your baby.  You know, it sounds like you have owned up to your mistake and have grown up quickly.  children are a huge responsibility and of course they are not always easy to take care of.  all you can do is take care of your baby to the best of your ability.  if you EVER need any help, dont be afraid to ask....the same with questions or concerns.  the more questions you ask the more knowledge you will be able to carry with you as you raise your little miracle!  you know, as for the father of the baby if you wanna take him to court later whenever you feel is ready then do it.  either get child support from him or have him terminate his parental rights so he wont be able to come into the picture later on when you least expect it....as for having feelings for him or wanting to be with it-I see it this way;  if he cant help raise the child he created and run from this baby. the chances of him either running from you or even your next child is just as high.  you dont want to be with somebody like this whom cant take responsibilty or is not mature.  if he really loved you he woulda done whatever he needed to to make things right....drop his butt and find a real man who loves you and your baby for who you are.  God bless you and good luck in the future..  be the best mother you can be!  love your baby and tell him/her every day-they truly are miracles<br>  <br>  ...its totally up to u whether or not u put his name on the birth certificate, however do NOT give the baby his last name....give the baby your last name!|`|KYvlD9o9aa	Honey honey honey.... let me tell u that u MOST MOST MOST definitely did the right thing. It takes a strong woman to raise a child by herself. My mom is a single mom herself, and personally, i would want it no other way because she has taught me how to be strong and only rely on yourself. She has been an inspiration and I have learned to be independent because she is. Of course it's hard right now sweetheart because your child is not here yet so you haven't really been able to feel the reward but trust me, when the child is here it will get easier. Sure, it'll be tough raising the child on your own but it has its rewards which makes it all worth while. When you've had a long day and you lay down with your child on your chest and look him/her and know that he/she is here because of YOU, there's no better feeling in the world. It'll get easier. That's the main point-it'll get easier. Once your child is born you'll never ask a question like this again because it will be VERY CLEAR to you that you made the right decision. I admire your decision and you'll do just fine.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I don't think he was worth your time if he left *that* quickly and moved in with a girl immediately. I think you made the right decision. Any time a guy threatens to leave if you don't do xyz about the baby, then you don't need him. <br>  <br>  Try looking up resources in your area - do you have friends, family that will help out? There should be programs that can help you with health insurance, that for the baby, WIC and other programs if you aren't making much money.<br>  <br>  You have to do what's best for you and the baby, and I think you made the right choice in ignoring the ultimatum put forth by some immature guy and going with what was right *for you.*|`|vigFmfLmaa	It sounds as if you made the right choice for you, but only you would know that.  From reading your post you sound very mature and responsible.  It will be hard but you can be a very good single mom.  It appears the father wouldn't have been of much worth even if he was around.  You can try for support but he's probably just going to deny the baby's his, and when proven it is will probably want to terminate his rights.  Personally, I wouldn't think a moment about him again.  I would give the baby my last name and not list the biological father.  If you don't really need his financial support it's not worth the trouble.  Be glad you're rid of him.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	Good for you, sweetie!  You'll see as time goes by and when you hold that precious baby for the first time, you're gonna realize that you can do this. With or with out him! About him, girl, get a lawyer and get some kind of financial support (child support)! Believe it or not, you're gonna need it.  Surround yourself with love, family and friends.  You'll be ok!|`|F4FJVq37aa	You made a great choice. And it sounds like you are doing great for your baby. I can't imagine how hard it must be for you. You really need to get him paying child support. You don't need to have any contact with him for that. Let the government take care of it. Good Luck|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I think that you are a VERY strong woman for keeping your baby.|`|5dd2d792aaf6e7abf3c831dee7f863ddaa	I noticed that all the answers are from women. As a man i feel ashamed so many men bail on their women they want to play but when its time to they don't man up and step up to the plate. He needs to no he has to assist you financialy like it or not one way or another he's a part of this and he can't just walk away like that. If you need a shoulder to lean on and there is no friend or family support available contact crisis pregnancey center and there are some wonderful women there who will stand with you and have abundant rescources to help you. Yes you made the right choice. God bless you.|`|G6lxr625aa	Like all the other mom's on here, you most definitely made the right choice.  The joy that child will bring you far surpasses any challenges of keeping the baby.  I am married, and was happy to have my son, but we are not very well off people, somehow God always provides, and are house is filled with joy because of our baby.  I know your circumstances are more stressful, but really your father is making a very bad decision, as after all you are his daughter and this is his grand child.  It is his loss my dear, and it should not be you that stays up late at night worried if you made the right decision.  You did, you are the best mother for your child.  Children are a blessing.  Something I think our society doesn't always understand.  Beautiful, wonderful, blessings.|`|Gd6CsEAbaa	You need to do what is right for you.  <br>  <br>  Imagine living your whole life with the guilt of giving up your baby ... you would end up hating yourself and resenting the father.<br>  <br>  You can not control other peoples feelings, reactions and deeds.  <br>  <br>  You need to be Ok with the fact that he has not supported you in this very difficult time ... it will most definitely make things more difficult because when you have a baby the more support you have the better. <br>  <br>  This will be a challenging time for you already and even more so because of his absece but don't let him  force his will/opinion on you don't let HIM make this decision for YOU.<br>  <br>  This is your decision and if in your heart you need to keep this child ...<br>  then, keep the baby.  <br>  <br>  I suspect you would be unable to live with yourself if you did not.  You can do this  ... stay true to you and raise this baby.<br>  <br>  You can do it ... and you never know maybe the father will have a change of heart, but even if he doesn't that is Ok too.<br>  <br>  C<br>  <br>  hope this helps.<br>  <br>  I would put his name as the father on the birth certificate but would not give him his last name.|`|X5FVNfQXaa	In my eyes you made the right choice. Right choices are different for everyone but I think you would have regretted giving up your baby for a guy who was so eager to leave, turn his back on you, the baby and his responsibilities and not to mention replace you with another girl right away. Based on all that I would say it’s pretty clear to me that you are doing the right thing. About the last name and birth certificate, it’s totally up to you, but if he doesn’t want anything to do with you guys I wouldn’t do either. You need to go get help for child support, whether or not you can afford your baby on your own is besides the point, he is the father, he made life with you and just because he thinks it’s that easy to just turn his head and walk away, he needs to be just as responsible for this situation. Child support is sometimes a hard and long process, believe me, but it is also the only way that he is going to realize that he messed up, not by creating a baby with you but by abandoning you guys. Please don’t let him get away with it.|`|bGRexKPyaa	Im not sure how old you are but you really did make a wonderful choice..<br>  <br>  Once you hold that baby in your arms your not going to be able to look back at how you could of givin this up...Its such a wonderful feeling...<br>  <br>  I'll be seventeen in a few months. Im 8 months pregnant and I was with the father until i was 6 months. He ended up being physically abusive..<br>  <br>  I was stupid for letting him do that to me. All I would do is cry which is bad for the baby... The first few weeks were kind of weird  but I cant tell you how happy I am with out him...<br>  <br>  You'll be fine. Your lucky he doesnt want anything to do with the baby..<br>  <br>  Get custody then child support....<br>  <br>  I can get custody but he will have some rights. Only supervised visition because of his record and he does drugs. Im going to move far away so that was he cant find me or my baby:]|`|kY8JTDD6aa	You are an amazing beautiful woman and don't you let anyone else tell you otherwise!  You have made the right choice.  He has made the wrong choice.  You will get the payback and he's going to be a lonely sick old man.  You could possibly force him to pay child support, if you took it to court, but I don't know if that will solve any problems or create more.  <br>  <br>  My wish for you; that you find a man who will respect you for the lovely woman that you are!!!|`|mAxChwHTaa	YOU DID!!! you cant even imagine how amazing it is to be a mommy... you are overcome with this amazing bond! i'm not going to be rude and call the dad a loser he just made the wrong choice and hopefully will realize soon before he misses out on his childs life... good luck to you! its awesome to hear that you made such a hard decision...it was honestly selfish of that father to say that to you...<br>   and yes it will be hard at first but definately worth it!!|`|oht9PNNHaa	I think you made the RIGHT decision!!! Think about do you really want a man like that around to teach your child bad things? There are plenty of other MEN out there just forget about that JERK! go with what the first comment said (sorry couldn't remember the name) don't put the fathers name on the certificate and don't give the child his name at all. You will LOVE this child with all your heart. You'll see!!!<br>  GOOD LUCK!! Enjoy that little bundle of joy!!!!!<br>  flipsy|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	You are better than me because I would never have dreamed of giving up my life for the stress of becoming a mother without being in a very stable relationship (which in my opinion is marriage), so already that's a point for you! You are a very strong person.<br>  <br>  If there is any help you can get from your family or friends, take it. I do not know what I can say to make you feel better other than keep your head up. Eventually you will become used to your new routine, and your life will be easier.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You need to see a lawyer<br>  <br>  Set up a DNA test, right after the birth<br>  Take him to the court right away<br>  <br>  A lawyer will help you do this<br>  <br>  He have to pay support rather or not he will be in the child life<br>  <br>  Do you have a friend, or a family member that can stay with you  for a while.

Too common.  And Eli sounds unfinished.  Maybe Elliott?<br>  <br>  Zavier Leo- Is this some kind of twist of Xavier?  I think it sounds made up.  And Leo doesn't go with it at all.<br>  <br>  Zoey Mya- Zoey is alright, Mya is decent, but there are too many y's in there.  Maybe Zoe Mya?<br>  <br>  And just a thought, the triplets are going to be compared enough as it is, maybe you shouldn't make their names so similar.  It isn't fair to them.  They need to be individuals.|`|f339a9f3cf7d571157484d675d6af3b7aa	Not really, think about it, all of their life they will be explaining to people how to spell and pronounce their names.  They should have their own individual name not rhyming names.  How about: Aiden and Javier, Zoey is okay.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	I don't like multiple names that all start with the same letter, plus I don't like any of those first names, so I say no. <br>  <br>  Eli, Leo, and Maya would be nice, though.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	i like the spelling of Xavier better <br>  I like Xaiden<br>  Xavier<br>  and Xoey<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452</a>|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Very unique ! i really like themm !|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	yeah, i like Zander Eli better though.|`|JnIy1uFyaa	yeah they are nice.<br>  <br>  I am personally fond of:<br>  Brenden<br>  Brett<br>  and Bailey|`|75btdWJkaa	Instead of Zaiden why not Zachary?

wpiWiWFiaa	Do not take a preg test until atleast 5 days before your expected period.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	If your discharge was a milky white it may mean that the pregnancy didn't take or just the normal result of having him discharge in you.. You could take a test on the weekend and it should be a good result. If you still aren't sure take the test the next weekend.<br>  To make sure he doesn't pull out wrap your legs over him and don't let him pull out.<br>  Good luck.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Because your cycles are irregular, it may help if you use an OPK vs. the online ovulation predictors. The earliest you can take a pregnancy test is 10-14 days after sex. Make sure you use your first mornings urine or you could get inaccurate results. You can also lean to read your CM and if you are having CM, meaning you are getting ready to ovulate, you should have sex every other night during the entire time you are producing CM. Also, make him stop pulling out!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I would wait 2-3 weeks to take a test so that you don't have to second guess it OR you could wait 1-2 weeks and go to the doctor to have your blood drawn to see if you're pregnant. Also, if you're not you can buy ovulation kits were all the monistat creams and stuff are and they will tell you what days you're ovulating.

I could always feel it, so I guess I've been fortunate. Some test will work only a few days after conception. Check the different web sites and they should say how long after it is accurate. Or you could go to the pharmacy and read the boxes.|`|zR0YShRnaa	For a pregnancy test well it is about 2 - 3 weeks after the presumed conception. Goodluck :)|`|ikPeJ0ZXaa	the waiting game sucks.<br>  but you have to.<br>  good luck!

tcHkn0VIaa	I am 5-7 and if i were 125 i would look anorexic and i would not be very healthy. the best thing to do is maintain a healthy weight and when you do get pregnant just try to make sure you eat right and you can do toning exercises because they are low impact when you are pregnant. I am 17 weeks along and have gained 5 lbs so far i hope to keep it around 20-25 lbs by the end of the pregnancy. for your height i would not loose anymore weight. just keep fit during pregnancy and it should help. I go to the chiropractor and he has me do exercises on the exercise/birthing ball. that strengthens the core muscles and gives a place for me to do exercises that are low impact but work. the core muscles will also help progress labor when the time comes and hopefully make things easier. Good luck|`|aJTBF7opaa	They say that it is not great to diet and loose weight befor attempting to get pregnant. And in all you could gain it all back and more. Your best bet is to be healthy, exercise, eat healthy and take vitamins.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Your body will gain what it needs to...if you eat right and continue working out you will be ok and it will be all belly!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	If pre-pregnancy weight was in the healthy range for your height according to your healthcare provider (a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9), you should gain between 25 and 35 pounds, gaining 2 to 5 pounds in the first trimester and about 1 pound per week for the rest of your pregnancy for the optimal growth of your baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you were underweight for your height at conception (a BMI below 18.5), you should gain 28 to 40 pounds. If you were overweight for your height (a BMI of 25 to 29.9), you should gain 15 to 25 pounds. If you were obese (a BMI of 30 or higher), you should gain no more than 15 pounds. If you're having twins you should gain about 35 to 45 pounds. If you fall into any of these four categories, talk to your healthcare provider about how much you should gain each month.<br>  <br>  <br>  Which being 5'8 and 140 is a BMI of 21.3 if you go to 125 you will have a BMI of 19.0

p2Njf5gBaa	Its completely normal.  I bleed for a good 8 weeks pretty steady, my doctor said it was normal.  <br>  the only reason for concern would be  large clots, soaking a pad once an hour for three hours,  green or muscusy discharge with a bad smell, fever, and severe cramps accompanying bleeding.

WHAT is a babby??<br>  <br>  Babby..LOL|`|WbJPQM1naa	the word is BABY... and if your child is still a "baby" ... under 2 yrs old, spanking or time out are pretty ineffective methods to discipline a child of this age.<br>  <br>  Time out is good for children 2 and over and it is recommended that you place the child in the time out space one minute for every year of their age.  So, if you have a four year old, don't keep them in time out more than four minutes and so forth.  <br>  <br>  If your child will not stay in the time out space, do not speak to them.  Just physically pick them up and place them back in the area until they learn they must stay put there.  And after they have had the time out, you talk to them about what they were punished for.  <br>  <br>  You can learn these techniques of effective discipline by watching the ABC program "The Nanny".  She really is "right on" in what she teaches struggling parents.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I know this works! I have seven children.|`|Knierqi9aa	A true spanking for a BABY is not the way to go.  Babies are just that and don't really "misbehave", they just might not be doing what you want.  Spanking a child under 2 is just plain old hitting.  They are way to young to connect the "hit' w/the behavior you think is bad.  Try being patient and showing the way to do things instead of punishing them.|`|bghotovYaa	Grammatical error....Babby?

The best thing to do is to remove the baby from the situation, while telling them in simple terms the reason why they are being removed.  For example, if the baby has just hit their sibling, pick the baby up and physically move them to the other side of the room to another activity, while saying something like, 'Stop! Hitting hurts Johnny!'  Then give lots of attention to the hurt sibling.|`|bMtHJPUgaa	My son would always misbehave when he was little.And i started putting him on time outs i would leave him for about 5 minutes and when he would calm down i would explain why i put him on time out and that i didn't like what he was doing and i would tell him to apologize and we would kiss and hug after .|`|hFGT2RCkaa	I was always told for their age. If they're 1, give'em 1 minute. 2, give'em 2 minutes. And so on.....and so on...... A minute for a child is a lifetime. 5 minutes for a 5-year old is the same. Good luck!|`|s7h8WhMyaa	5-10 minutes, so they are bored, but not angry|`|28faeb718c3bfbe0b10b707965bb142baa	how old is the baby|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	you shouldn't put babbies in time out.  you need to circumspank them|`|1tmX7xbRaa	the dr's and books say a minute per age but that doesn't always work. i think 5-10 minutes is effective. if they keep getting up then you keep putting them back and the time starts all over again
AA12029875	2 year old babies do not get jealous.  what you can do is expose the child to infants or infant dolls, and teach the toddler how they need to be cared for.  When the new baby comes be sure to give the older one attention first and have the older one participate in the care of the new baby.  Don't over talk about your stomach and what's in it.  Teach your child that infants are fragile and not big like he/she is.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	get her a doll to take care of and dont keep talking about the baby|`|wqRwSaGSaa	tell her how improtant it is that shes going to be a big sister.<br>  and all the good things about it.<br>  when i was born we have my older sister on video tape sticking buggers in my hand and saying i dont want her take her back.<br>  they all get jelous try to find ways to warm her up to it.

I was having trouble in Geometry and I felt like the dumbest person because I'm an honors kid but I bombed my test and my teacher suggested tutoring. But no one will think you're dumb and it made a world of a difference!<br>  <br>  -Get all the bonus you can. Even if your teacher offers one bonus point for something, take advantage of it. Trust me, they add up and can make or break your grade!<br>  <br>  -Study. This seems like a tip that makes you wanna say, "Well, duh!" But tests are usually the most points when it comes to grades and when you know the material and ace the test, you can watch your grade raise instantly! So study for 10-15 minutes each night for the subjects your struggling in, even if you don't have a test coming up.  It will take so much pressure off of you when you aren't cramming AND you'll get a better grade. So study up :)|`|uyfTeiyraa	Go up to them all crying and sniffly and be like "M-m-mom? D-d-d-dadddd?

SEzIkGNiaa	First get certified.  I started out by handing out flyers to neighbors/people I knew with children.  If you don't know anyone with kids, then you can ask people if they know anyone that might need a sitter.  You could also advertise in a local church.  On the flyer put:<br>  <br>  Name<br>  Number or Email<br>  Age<br>  Rates<br>  Experience<br>  Availability/Flexibility<br>  <br>  **Please do not advertise over the internet as it is very dangerous!**|`|pcjOQDymaa	isnt there like your neighborhood contact info or something?<br>  and like they have kids there as babysitters, pet sitters etc. <br>  or just ask your mom to find you babysitting jobs|`|Cl9m4aSpaa	Babysit people you know who have kids. Family,friends,neighbors. Most likely since ur only 14, you'll only be able to babysit bigger kids,not too many little ones. But start off that way and as u get older you'll gain more expeirence so by the time your atleast 18 you can post a ad offering your services.|`|Tf19RETiaa	sure thats the right age. maybe put an ad in the local newspaper<br>  or if you have any neighbors that have little kids, you could ask to watch them. get your mom or a friend to help out too. i started when i was 13. good luck ~|`|okpAjss6aa	Ask your parents to ask people they know if you can watch there kids.|`|2pyo09fEaa	well my mom helped me start<br>  mhhm well why don't you try and get ur mom to help <br>  you i have like a billion people it works
6qCnpxrNaa	It's likely nothing to worry about seeing as how she doesn't seem to be running a fever and is still eating.  I would consult the pediatrician though even if it's only to ease your mind.  Good Luck!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	It's most likely just the teething or perhaps a growth spurt. I'm betting the teething though. I'd just keep an eye on her for a few days and if it doesn't change call her doctor. Try some tylenol for her teething, and see if that helps.|`|3Xdxqyunaa	Maybe teething or a growth spurt? Maybe she has a flu without a fever?? As long as she is drinking plenty of milk then i wouldnt worry too much about all the sleeping. She is little and needs rest to grow!!!<br>  By the way what are teething pills??? Maybe overuse of these can make you sleepy....i have never heard of these pills. Maybe you shouldnt use them anymore or dont use them until you actually see a tooth coming through.
APi1iZREaa	There are a lot of good resources on breastfeeding that you can find at your local bookstores, as this answer is far more in depth than can be answered here.<br>  <br>  But as a general rule, you shouldn't introduce formula until you and the baby are both comfortable with and good at breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is something that can be very difficult to learn to do properly, and can be very frustrating. Introducing formula too early can make it even more difficult.<br>  <br>  With my first child, I breastfed and used formula, and because it's actually easier for babies to drink from the bottle than from the breast, she wouldn't drink from the breast. I learned the hard way not to introduce the bottle so early.<br>  <br>  With my son, I breastfed for two months before I added the bottle, and it went much more smoothly.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	If you plan on nursing I would recommend just doing that you can pump and use the breast milk in the bottles nurse as much at you can it is free!!!...and if you want to intoduce formula if it were me I would wait till past 6 months...But that is me and what I would do...Hope I helped...|`|faPKwClPaa	Yes, and your doctor will (or should be able to) give you good advice when to use (supplement) with it.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i plan on breast feeding all the time,i am a stay at home mom and a little older(alot) then with my other 2,but i still want to give her formula.....so i can leave her with others and for the convienence....my ob tells me she will be small for term and to encourage supplementing,i have no problem with this as long as i can breast feed also...i think you can offer it at any time,some say tho to wait until she is established to the breast so they dont get confused,but they will have to get used to the different nipples,try to find a bottle nipple closest to your own nipple and most bottles have matching pacifiers.....your midwife or dr or a breastfeeding specialist would be your best  advisors....goodluck!!|`|XXZFf1AYaa	I can just tell you from my experience, but ask your ob/gyn at the next appointment or see about access to a lactation nurse.<br>  <br>  I breastfed my son until about 5-6 months, when I introduced formula. I offered the formula in a bottle at a scheduled feeding time, and he hated it. I ended up mixing 25% formula/75% breastmilk and gradually adding more formula as he would drink it until he'd take a bottle of formula. I continued to breastfeed at nights and mornings until he was 13 months old and he had formula at daycare and when I had an appointment etc. and he was left with someone else.<br>  <br>  Just to add: I did use the pump, and while it made it possible for him to breastfeed for longer, and mix formula and so on, be aware that its time consuming and if you have a job it can be a challenge. The benefits to the baby are well worth it, which is why I snuck into the bathroom at work several times a day to pump, but I know for some its too difficult and that's ok too.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	There isn't anything wrong with breastfeeding and also formula feeding.  I would introduce them to something like Carnation Good Start.  Its more mild on their tummy's.  Isomil or Simulac can be hard.<br>  Hensforth they burp up and it smells horrible, lol<br>  Talk with your Dr. to find out more|`|wxbGmxbOaa	I know that you can use formula and also breast feed. How you go about doing this I'm not completely sure. You should discuss this with your doctor. He or She will know a lot more than anyone on here.|`|NXNjBlvzaa	If you're not producing enough breast milk to satisfy your little one, or if you're planning on going back to work, there's nothing wrong with supplementing with formula.  If you're not, there's still nothing wrong, but I'm not sure why you'd want to supplement.<br>  <br>  As for what age, it'd probably be best to wait until after nursing is well established (4-6 weeks) if at all possible.  If you want to be the one to feed baby the bottles, be aware that a lot of nursed babies refuse bottles from Mum.  They don't want formula when they can smell the yummier tasting breast milk.|`|83nHy2PXaa	yes... BUT it may reduce your milk supply. Eventually you may end up giving up breastfeeding because of not having enough milk.<br>  Let me explain how it works. Milk is produced supply-demand. If there is less demand (and it will be if you supplement with formula) - less milk is produced.<br>  Besides, sometimes it's easier for a baby to take a bottle than to learn the proper latch to get her milk from the breast. With a bottle she doesn't have to work hard. If you give her that choice too early, before you are really into a good breastfeeding relationship, she may refuse to take a breast.<br>  I would not introduce formula in first 2-3 months.. hope it helps|`|UfiyOrW3aa	I used both at first.  But then I bought a Medela dual electric pump and pumped when I was at work.  I noticed that my daughter got constipated when I gave her formula.  Breast milk is easier to digest.  <br>  <br>  Think of this this way............formula is fake milk made up of chemicals!  For me, all breast milk was better.  But, if you really want to use both you can ask your pediatrician when to introduce the formula.  Good luck|`|f29c201fc2a29ba2d20c78d6c9cc3733aa	yes i did at about 3 weeks! but talk to ur doctor|`|YiDhb60Paa	yes
LN3LMIm1aa	Yes, it is possible to dilate in a matter of hours. When I was pregnant with my first (and only.lol) I went triage, three times a day for three days in a row. My due date had got pushed back a week and I was heart broken...lol. The contractions were strong (very strong...lol) but I wouldn't dilate past 1cm. On the third day of my visits (by that time I was the joke of triage) I was in so much pain because of the contractions. When the doctor checked me, I was still at 1cm...not enough to admit me. I wanted to cry! So again they sent me home and told me to walk around to speed up the process and come back in three hours. I was in so much pain walking around was not an option. Once I got home I had decided not to even go back to the hospital because I figured they would send me back home.....again. Even my husband thought I was just being dramatic at this point. Thank God the doctor called me and told me to come back in. On returning to the hospital I was at 4cm..enough to admit me. And I had a beautiful baby boy in my arms not even four hours later. So all of that is to say. You never know when or how long it will take, but ease your mind IT WILL HAPPEN. lol God Bless!!|`|fPuZGkmsaa	Everyone is different. Some people dilate quickly and deliver in a matter of hours. While other people dilate slowly. If you lost your mucus plug you should deliver within a week or two after loosing it. Do not stress your Dr isn't going to let you go much longer before they induce you. When is your next appointment? I know how you feel I was 41 weeks and lost my mucus plug and thought that I was going to loose my mind. Luckily for me I went into labor that night. But again everyone is different. I think that you are going to be welcoming your new addition very soon. Good Luck and Congratulations.|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	It can be anywhere from a few hours to 24 plus hours|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, you could go into labor in an hour, and have your baby a few hours later. Or you might have another week to go.  Or anything in between.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	oh my..i feel for you,is induction not an option?......who knows how long it will take,it sound like your little bundle is very comfy where its at...lol....ive been dilated 2 since 32 weeks,and the last 2 weeks have really been doing the most effacing and she is now at 0 station....they just tell me,walk,walk,walk....the gravity helps pull her down and the father down she gets the more pressure put on the cervix encouraging effacing and dilation.....they said sex to ,but who wants to do that,,,shes right there!!   lol
mf3OOagMaa	Morning sickness is different for everyone. A lot of it is based on rapid hormone level changes that occur while your body is getting use to carrying another human being. So just as suddenly as it begins, it ends - but their is no set timeline. You have ups and downs. Your hormones are all over the place (some women get weepy).  Some women don't have any symptoms - others have every sypmtom and spend A LOT of time nauseous / violently puking / dry heaving.<br>  Morning sickness can be a lot like having the flu - or food poisoning (stuck between the bed and the bathroom) or it can be a lot like bulemia (you puke and move on with the day). Morning sickness can be a combination of all of the above. You can have a fever, chills, sweats, body aches - or not (or you might only have these symptoms for a few hours, a few days, or not at all).<br>  Morning Sickness is just a name, it doesn't only happen in the morning - it can happen 24-7. I think the "morning" term came around because most women feel woozy (and can start getting sick) the moment they wake up and sit up - like instant motion sickness (this is why Dr's advise to keep crackers by your bedside, so that you can get something into your empty stomach as soon as possible - to help for quick nourishment, to settle your tummy, or to just give you something to puke up... <br>  The one significant difference between morning sickness and the flu / food poisoning / motion sickness???? SCENTS! The things that you smell (or eat) can make a difference. You can be fine one moment, but because of hormone changes - your scent perception (and taste buds) is heightened (you become way more sensitive, a super sniffer!) and things that normally wouldn't bother you (or even smells or foods that you normally would love) can make you puke uncontrollably on the spot, often without much warning. You learn to avoid these scents (or foods). Though, just when you think you are doing everything right - you get overheated and then, you puke.<br>  Of course with the puking, you can feel crummy, dizzy (usually a sign of dehydration) - which can make you puke, and generally hate being pregnant. It can be 1 day, 2 weeks, or 3 or more months of Montezuma's Revenge (With my first child I was sick for almost 6 months - others are sick the entire 9 months - the general rule of thumb is 3 months, or the first trimester). Morning Sickness is kind of like a hang-over that wont go away - and there isn't much you can take to "feel better", because it might affect the baby. You just have to deal with it the best way that you can.<br>  What is morning sickness like? It is different for everyone - but if you get it (most women do at one point or another during their pregancy), it sucks!|`|PkjZA2o9aa	They call it "morning sickness" however they should call it all day sickness. When i was pregnant with both mine i would just wake up feeling week on the stomache, and it would just get worser during the day, i couldn't hold down food or drink when i had it either. I didn't have it everyday though, and it gradually went away around the 3-4mth or so. It was awful, throwing up, indigestion, heartburn, it drove me crazy. Saltine crackers helped a bunch though|`|FYDw1rjlaa	I can tell you that it's not something one would want to feel at all. I have really bad morning sickness throughout my pregnancies with my two kids. For me, I constantly get headaches, cannot stand the smell of any kind of food and throw up like every 10 minutes and after I eat something. Sometimes nothing come out even when you really need to throw up.|`|MPaFhjuHaa	well my sister which is pregnant she doesnt only get it in the morning but if she smells anyything too strong shel throw up.<br>  if someone farts infront of her she doesnt smell it but just the thought of the smell makes her tummy flip. lol|`|9y9Voxqdaa	oh i'm just getting over it its Terrible Nobody Likes when ppl get it they just cough sneeze have head aches  a body aches and much more i'm still recovering from it|`|coTOLaukaa	its different for everyone, a lot of people throw up after eating or waking up, or they throw up randomly. some people just feel like they are going to throw up, but never actually do.|`|AidFf0C8aa	horrbble dizzy|`|2Pcv97j5aa	it sucks!!!!|`|0lnamekJaa	You wake up feeling fine...<br>  <br>  Then you get hungry...<br>  <br>  Then you eat something for breakfast...<br>  <br>  Then in 10 min's, you throw up...<br>  <br>  Then you feel fine...<br>  <br>  Then you get really thirsty because you threw up your breakfast...<br>  <br>  So you drink a big glass of Iced Tea...<br>  <br>  Then in 10 mn's, you throw up...<br>  <br>  Then you feel fine...<br>  <br>  Lather, rinse, repeat...<br>  <br>  This happened to me all day... It was NOT 'morning' sickness. I lost a LOT of weight then started to crave sugar and the only thing I could really keep down was sweet tarts.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	It's different for every woman. Some get it only in the morning. Some get it lasting all day. Some women's will stop after the first trimester, some will be sick til they deliver. You can't really predict how one pregnancy will be from the next. One of my sisters did not actually throw up. She just always was nauseous. Two of my other sisters were sick from the beginning to the end of their pregnancy.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Its horrible. You don't have to throw up for it to be morning sickness and its different for everyone. Its not always just in the morning either. Its generally a nauseous feeling that you get when you eat certain things (there are no specific foods that cause it, it just depends on the person and the day) or when you have an empty stomach, some people will get it just from the smell of things and some people won't get it at all. I was lucky and only had it for a few weeks but some people get it the whole way through their pregnancy and sometimes it goes away for weeks and comes back later.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	Its different for everyone.  Some people are nauseous all the time and throw up constantly.  Some other people are just nauseous and never throw up.  Some people are lucky enough that morning sickness comes and goes throughout the day and its not constant.  Some more lucky people never get sick at all.  Honestly, its different for everyone and you never know how its going to be for you until your pregnant and are dealing with it.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Every woman is different.  For me it was all day sickness.  I always felt like I was about to be sick.  Sometimes I did vomit and sometimes I just felt like I was.  With my First child it lasted the whole time I was pregnant and with my second it was on and off.|`|AA12016833	It all depends on the person. With me, everytime i ate a full meal i would feel like i had to throw up, but i never did.|`|ZDnLfB5daa	It can make some people throw up and others just get nauseous, usually it is only during the first trimester of pregnancy and sometimes it can be in the third trimester as well. It is not constant, and if you put saltine crackers by the bed, in the morning when you wake up eat a few before you get up it can sometimes prevent morning sickness.|`|64OsCr8laa	there are times where mine just lingers but when that happens i never throw up. but when it makes me sick sick it just comes on all at once i throw up then about 30 mins later it comes back i throw up , that normally last about 3 hours then im mine until that night then it comes back again.<br>  <br>  oh certian smells make you sick also like pickels and pizza make me sick<br>  so really it cant be definded as one thing really its everything|`|kQA7SbY9aa	All of the scenarios you mentioned are possible with 'morning sickness'. For me, it was just feeling nauseous...and it could happen at any time of day. I usually never threw up, but many women do. It wasn't constant. Sometimes brought on by an odor...sometimes nothing at all. I had the hardest time during my first trimesters (I have three kids). With my first pregnancy, I had to carry a plastic bag whenever I drove in my husband's car. It affects every woman differently, or not at all.|`|z1YM1Xniaa	morning sickness for me was/is like having the grim reaper breathing on shoulder all day long. Stomach pain, nausea, heartburn. It is constant. You don't always want to throw up but the thought is never far off. Smells (like ground meat and cooked eggs) give me migraines and send me running to the bathroom. Gag on anything that I am forcing myself to eat. <br>  <br>  It is not like this for everyone. Every pregnancy is different. This is my first baby and I got it baaadddd.|`|7xit1ogxaa	Each woman is different. It can occur anytime of day. Mine was usually in the evening, and even then I didn't have it every day. My sister had all day morning sickness. Some people are just nauseous and never actually get sick.|`|kH56qw2Taa	well mine i just felt sick and then it came up then once ure sick ure fine but i felt sick all the time and just really under the weather lol its away now thank goodness it really isnt nice:P|`|MeYILJeSaa	When I got it, I threw up then instantly felt better.<br>  I was so gross. I would often throw up my meal, but then I would be wiping my face off and be like, "Mmm, did someone say pizza?"|`|hzQDocWaaa	when you get sick in the morning
phZR63Rdaa	i do this with my five year old...<br>  <br>  Take some different colored dried beans and/or dried rice and use your measuring cups and she can learn about measurements.<br>  <br>  she loves to play, it teaches her basic math skills, and keeps her occupied for hours! <br>  I will even make "recipes" that she needs to make. <br>  <br>   1 cup brown Beans. 1/2 cup rice and 1/2 cup black beans<br>  how many cups of food do you have?  _________

Good luck, utimately if babe is not ready to come out he won't!! Sorry.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	i heard of people pumping their breasts to induce labor.|`|kvYgopThaa	just keep walking and try squats (helps baby move down birth canal if he/she is ready) But really it just all depends on when baby is read, he/she isn't going to come until he/she is ready all you can do is exercise, try to help he/she down the birth canal (by squats which also helps to strengthen muscles for during labor so that labor is a little easier) and Waiting. Sorry i can't sleep at night either and am having uncomfortable pains in my back and under my pelvic bone so i Know how you feel.|`|kY8JTDD6aa	You've tried it all sister, short of being induced and trying Castor oil, which I didn't try either because my doctor told me it is messy (He said it inflames the bowels so you get diarrhea and some of the inflammation can pass on to the uterus and cause contractions.)  It seems you just might have to stick it out for another week or so.  Good luck!  My mom used to ask for a sleeping pill which she would be hospitalized for because it can start labour, and it always started labour for her. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, one thing I forgot, you can try getting a back massage.  That can apparently loosen things up enough to start labour.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	You said  raspberry tea, but was that raspberry LEAF tea or just raspberry flavored tea. the hearbal kind is said to be more effective. the baby may not be ready yet because none of this is going to work if the baby is not ready. good luck to you. I would try to relax. I know easier said than done but maybe all the stress and activity are causing your body to work against itself. calm down and try to do some breathing exercises. you could ask your dr. to sweep your membranes which is where they will separate your bag of waters from the cervix. it can be uncomfortable and may not work but since you are full term already your dr will probably do that automatically at your next visit|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Just wait for your baby to naturally trigger labor...<br>  what if its not ready? If your dates were off you could be trying to force a baby who isn't ready into the world...<br>  Just be patient...no one is pregnant forever.<br>  <br>  And castor oil will only make you poop and puke!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	walk around...that will drop your uterus or something...oooorrrrr......you can get induced at the hospital....|`|70j0Bmzdaa	i know you don't want to use it but it does work.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think that's about it. Good luck and I hope it happens soon for you!|`|mAxChwHTaa	waiting.... walking worked for me... keep walking!!|`|NV5CQU8Taa	Try Papaya, it has the same components as the induction drug, but you have to eat a LOT of it.
4t5eGShiaa	I'm pretty sure that they would be able to tell if you had twins because they would have been able to detect 2 fetal poles and 2 heartbeats. But you never know!!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	it is possible. some ladies find that they are having twins until later on. & doctors have missed it. It can happen.<br>  <br>  But Vaginal U/s is alot more accurate then ultrasound.So mostlikely one bubs inside.<br>  Keep your hopes up but not too much. because it can happen.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your Pregnancy !!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	If its baby number #4 why do you want it to be 2 in there? that would be 5 kids.I dunno everyone swore I had two in there because my stomach is humongous but 2 sonograms later theres only. Well some women dont know theyre carrying twins until later on because 1 may hid behind the others so its possible or it might just be that you wanted it so bad your thinking it too much|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I have twins and it was very very obvious on an 8 week ultrasound that there was 2 babies in there. At 8 wks and a transvaginal ultrasound, I would say it is highly unlikely they missed a twin in there. Sorry. I would trust the tech and assume that you are only having one baby.|`|7xit1ogxaa	They usually are able to catch twins early on. I'm pretty sure that a fibroid can't be mistaken for a baby since a fibroid does not have a heartbeat. Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I always say anything is possible however the trans vaginal sonogram as you know with three other pregnancies behind you is more accurate than a regular ultrasound. You may want to keep an eye on your growth sense you know what to expect then you will know if things are different. I was sure i had twins but at 10 weeks and 2 days they showed me one and it took a while to get used to but now I am over it. I will have more time to give to this baby one on one instead of juggling two newborns at once. Do your best to wait patiently for your next ultrasound and just be prepared that there may just be one in there. Good luck with everything.|`|WaTezVS0aa	It is possible. A friend of mine used clomid to get pregnant, and I always teased her that she was going to have twins. She went in for the 8 week ultrasound, and they were like, "theres just one baby" and a few weeks later she went in for another one and found out that she was pregnant with twins! So yes, it can be possible to be pregnant with twins.|`|iJZ43J0taa	I have a twin brother and my mom said that my father actually told her before we were born that he had a feeling they would have twins. Obviously there was nothing scientific about it, just a hunch or a feeling, but well, here we are! Twins! lol So I guess just keep waiting, keep up the ultrasounds and if you do have multiples, they'll be seen on the ultrasounds eventually. at 8 weeks, babies are still pretty tiny.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	Anything is possible!  But I would feel pretty confident that there is only one in there after an 8 week US.  But I am sure it wouldn't be the first time that a twin was missed on an ultrasound.
Ccq8zEcnaa	It is called leukkorhea. It is common and normal in pregnancy. It's your body's way of regulating your vaginal insides. As long as it is odorless and doesn't change in color (like pink tinged, blood tinged, brown, or green) then you shouldn't be worried. Call your doctor and just let him/ her know that you are having a discharge. Sometimes they will do a culture just to make sure you don't have an infection. But other than that it's called leukkorhea and is normal in pregnancy!|`|xpstigPTaa	That sounds a bit strange. Did you talk to your doctor about it? I would ask your doctor to take a look at you. Very interesting! Best of luck!|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Just sounds like the icky things that are common to happen during pregnancy.|`|dq24rqtsaa	I asked a very similar question...I'm not positive if I'm pregnant yet (I haven't missed my period yet, but have had tender breasts, tiredness, yadda yadda) but I had the same type of discharge...it wasn't normal for me.<br>  <br>  No one was particularly helpful, I got "an STD" and "it must be a UTI".<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's probably just a normal pregnancy thing for some people.  The hormones are changing, and so is the type of mucous your cervix is producing.  I don't see why that type of discharge HAS to be an indication of infection.<br>  <br>  This probably wasn't terribly helpful, since it's just my opinion, but hey, it was nice to know someone else had the same thing going on.  (and that they were definitely pregnant when they got it...it makes me even more hopeful!)|`|7KkTel7Oaa	could be just normal discharge from pregnancy. Could be a yeast infection. just mention it to your doc the next time you go in.
P544Sbmqaa	To give benefit of the doubt, she was probably overly stressed and needed a moment of me time.  <br>  <br>  However, it was incredably unprofessional.|`|bRAmXcowaa	its not something i would have done, but prehaps she feels safe with all of the people in the office? Safe enough to leave her kids in your care?<br>  I dont think it was good judgement but most new mum's are a litlle worn out a tired and have lapses of judgement. I call it baby brain (same like when they are pregnant - except it contiunes after they give birth) <br>  She probably felt like an idiot when she thought about it later|`|auUeI2Vnaa	They released preemies from the hospital on ventilating machines??<br>  <br>  Being a mom of premature twins, I find the doctors to be irresponsible for releasing them from the NICU.<br>  <br>  However, if they were indeed healthy enough to be sent home, then they would be healthy enough to be supervised by friends for 20 minutes.|`|mHQN3Ml6aa	Not good judgment at all. She should have at least taken them with her to get her eyebrows done.She should take someone with her if she is bringing the babies out.  Who knows, if she knows everyone at the eye brow place too, she might leave them there to go to the nail salon.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	thats foolish of her. she thought of herself before the safety of her children. especially since they are premature also. i would never do that to my baby boy and he's even a full term baby|`|sYjYbkvWaa	Sounds like a not so smart mom. Kind of selfish to leave them in an office, place of work, while she got her brows done.|`|PDwh2Tt2aa	well for one thing i think you left out selfish. if you were at work nd she left her two babies there to get her eyebrows done when im sure you were busy i think thats selfish. also neglectful and foolish! i agree with the woman below, those babies shouldnt have been released!|`|VquZAwfHaa	Unless you work at a daycare, it was inappropriate at the very least. Also, just because you work with people doesn't mean you know them- would you trust your babies with someone you only work with? I'm not a mom, but I wouldn't.|`|7ck7boGhaa	I think it was in poor taste but not neglectful. Cut her a little slack she has been at home with two crying babies and probably needs a little time to herself.|`|Nwx9NZ8Vaa	I don't suppose her name Kate Mccann?
tJzlPhm5aa	Hey I am so sorry to hear about your miscarriage.  I too had one on Dec 2, 2008.  They told me to wait until the the bleeding stopped to have sex again and not to start trying again until after your first "normal" period.  Which I got mine three weeks later.  We haven't had any luck so far but I'm not giving up! ...I wanted to add that I didn't have a D&C and when they checked me with an internal ultrasound they said everything looked ok, and that's why they said that I only needed to wait a month or until I was emotionally ready to try again.<br>  <br>  Once again, I know what you are going thru.  Best of luck and lots of baby dust for you in the future!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You don't have to wait.  Your body is ripe especially if it's early.  Just watch your cervical mucous for when you start to ovulate and go for it again, when you get the positive test, call a midwife for the safest and best possible birth experience.  <br>  Wait until you've missed at least 2 periods  first to test again though as it can take up to 4 to 6 weeks to get the hormone out of your system from the last pregnancy, depending on how far along you were.|`|A0tWlG94aa	oh i am sooo sorry for your loss.. extremely sorry...i dont know the correct answer to your question..i just thought id let you know that ill be thinking of you<br>  <br>  x|`|AA11079476	im so sorry to hear that if i were you i'd take a break for at least a month or so|`|dI0sFdgKaa	Im so sorry to hear that. I would wait awhile, ask your doctor, Your going to have to go to the doctor anyways to get cleaned up (if you dont you'll get a bad infection)|`|QWfkHyUeaa	i'd give it a month and then try again.. i am very sorry, and wish you all the luck in the future|`|OiQSYuE8aa	Ask your doctor. Only doctor can give you the best answer.|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	I am so sorry Hon,  I just went through a miscarriage in January, so I know what you are going through.  How far along were you?  I was 5 weeks when I miscarried and I didn't need a D&C.  My midwife ordered an ultrasound to make sure everything was clear and she did a vaginal exam.  Everything looked good, so she said I could start ttc again as soon as I got a period.  She also ordered me bloodwork to make sure my hcg was down.  And She even told me that If you have a miscarriage and you get pregnant right away...IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL MISCARRY AGAIN!!!  Now if you had a D&C you need to wait for 3 months to give yourself time to heal physically.  Alot of doctors will tell you to wait 6 months, but this is for emotional healing.  Hope this Helps!!!|`|VS8mactUaa	Doctors would like you to wait 6 months, to give your insides time to heal, but make sure its not before 3 months, I found out I was pregnant 3 months after My miscarriage, andIm 5 weeks now, and all is well so far, but your chances of having a miscarriage are higher if you're not healed properly thats why My doctor are a little concerned of a repeat miscarriage. Good Luck And Im so sorry for your loss. But dont worry it ill help again, as well if you feel depressed you really have to talk to someone. I know its not easy going through this.<br>  <br>  And as for those saying wait a month or its ok to start right away, NO its not, You seriously have to wait a minimum of 3 months to keeps the odds, up. But yes you can get pregnant right away its just not recommend as it heightens your chance of a repeat miscarriage.
PvnnWE1Baa	GIrl, you better let these people give you these showers! My mother n law is already planning one (For older ladies & relatives) & my best friend is planning another(for younger guests & friends). The more gifts you receive the better, so you won't have to be burdened buying extra stuff:-) I say enjoy being pampered! You & your baby deserve it!|`|pHAKN32yaa	i had 2 showers with my first and both were great.<br>  there's NOTHING wrong with having moRe Than 1 shower! that just means u and the baby are LOVED!!!!|`|3NoDjKLoaa	i think the thing you are talking about is having more than one shower for more than one child.. you usually dont have a shower for your second child, i know many people who have had more than one shower for their first child.. its all fine, just be sure to space them apart (or tell the people you would like them at least 2 weeks apart) that way you can update your registry of the things you got from the last shower... you dont need two of everything, unless you want to take them back for store credit.  I would be really happy to have two showers, you should be well prepared for the baby to come.. also a thing many women dont do for their registry is ask for things for when the baby is a little older.. dont just get all newborn clothes and things, ask for many different sizes, that way you have things for the future.. newborn size is not going ot fit very long on your newborn. (same goes for diapers)|`|6cwJi5kxaa	To be honest it shouldnt matter if they dont know each other that well. I think they should get together and make it one big baby shower. The shower isnt for them its for you and the baby. If you are married then the entire family should be invited.  Two families have now become one!<br>  <br>  For instance this just happened to me. My sister in law had two baby showers. One by one side of the family and one by her hubbys side of the family. Now im sorry but none of her side of the family got invites. I think it is very rude.|`|6wjjxeeOaa	I'm pregnant my self :) <br>  I'm pretty sure I am going to have more than one,<br>  Just because different people want to throw me one.<br>  I know the future God Mother wants to plan a shower <br>  and so will my mom and sisters. So what I'm going to do<br>  is have a "Shower the Baby With Diapers", I get nothing but diapers for the baby ! It's great help ! They ca last over 3 months maybe more. And  a Baby shower where they can bring whatever gift they'd like :)<br>  <br>  <br>  does it make sense ? <br>  <br>  haha|`|X5FVNfQXaa	So... what's your question? Just have 2 different showers. If some people want to come to both just let them know they can, I don't think they would feel obligated to bring a gift to both. I am also pregnant with my first child and my family and my husband's family like to have nothing to do with each other so I am guessing I will also be given two different showers, no big deal.|`|XtzBxxJBaa	I know several people who have had more than one shower.  Like one at work, one at church, and one with non-church friends.  <br>  <br>  Could the post you were reading have meant they were having another shower - for a second child ?  That seems to get on people's nerves, because quite a bit of the stuff you get for your first child can be used for the second one.  <br>  <br>  If I were you I would make sure your MILs and SILs know you would love for them to come to both but that you don't expect them to get you multiple gifts.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	I had two showers with my daughter. My mom, her family and my friends at one; my dad, his family and my church at the other. My parents divorced when I was 17 and still don't get along ( I will be 28 soon) and we (my sister and I) have two of everything.<br>  The only thing my parents have gone to at the same time since they divorced is our weddings (my sister and I) and our kids birthday parties because me and my sister refuse to have separate b-day parties for our kids.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	It completely ok to have a babyshower from whoever wants to give you one. My cousin had 4! With her first baby she had her family give her one, her inlaws, the people from church, and the people from work. No one that it was rude, bc no one went to more than 1, except me bc i wanted to go to all of them and see the different things they did, but i only gave her one gift. She got everything she needed, bc when she got the gifts, she sent out thank you cards, and then the things that she got duplicates of, she took back and replaced them with other necesseties. I wouldnt worry what everyone thinks, this is the one time in your life that you are going to NEED stuff, and people are actually going to buy them for you! I would take whatever you can with a big gracious smile. Everything else is just drama. Take care of that baby!
IOp3knBjaa	While you probably will not even get another opportunity to find out until around 20 weeks, I will say I found out this baby was a boy when I was 14 weeks! It is in some cases possible to find out at this time but that is not the normal. I have read of people finding out at around 12-13 weeks. Congrats on the baby and best of luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Typically you are scheduled for your anatomy scan between 18-22 weeks and that is when they tell you. Some people can find out as early as 14 weeks, but it depends on the baby.|`|zATQaiwIaa	the general rule of thumb is the 20 week ultrasound|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	Well technically the genitals are developed right now, but they usually don't tell you until the 18 or 20 week ultrasound.  It is more accurate when the baby is further along.  I just had my 13 week ultrasound and I swear I see that it is a boy (on the 4D ultrasound pic), but we'll see.|`|NvaiomHVaa	there are many ways to predict the gender.. Here is a good article about gender prediction methods:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1451537/a_guide_to_gender_prediction.html?cat=52" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  best of luck to you!|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	16-20 weeks|`|joPJtKemaa	at 20 weeks.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	When I was pregnant I didn't get my ultrasound until I was 20 weeks. That is the prime time to check the baby's gender. I have heard that you may be able to tell by the babies heartbeat. If it is high (in the 140 range) they say it is a boy. If it is lower then they say that it is a girl. I know that my son was always 140 or higher. That may be just an old wives tale or there could be some truth to it. You are not really going to know until the ultrasound though. I know that it is agony waiting but it makes that moment even better. Good Luck!! And Congratulations.|`|irHF6CBPaa	It all depends on the clinic and their practices but most Dr do it at around 20 weeks(I did) but others get it at 18 weeks so it depends on your DR so it can be done around 16-20 weeks you could ask your Dr when he/she will be doing it|`|JreuGwJYaa	For my 1st son I found out at 19 weeks my second son I found out at 20 weeks and now my daughter we found out at 17 weeks.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	We hear the heartbeat at week 11, then find out the sex at 20 weeks.
XRbHcGuLaa	Hi there.  It sounds like you are using condoms regularly and properly and so the chance that you got pregnant using them is very unlikely.  But since you are late for your period now (based on your last period dates) you may want to take a home pregnancy test to make sure.  Some people think that stress and worry can also delay your period from starting so if you go ahead and take a pregnancy test, you will feel relieved immediately.  Go do it tonight!  And if this is your first time taking a pregnancy test, just remember that any line, faint or dark on the test portion mean positive... lots of people ask that on here.  Good luck to you and relax.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Take a test and get new rubbers|`|F4rCjV1haa	They are not a 100% safe.They are known to break.|`|WPI0Z47saa	My friend and her husband used a condom and are now expecting a baby. They work well but still aren't 100%. Could have been a tiny tear that you can't see with the naked eye but that is all that it takes.<br>  <br>  If you have sex then you have to accept the fact that you could become pregnant no matter what method you are using.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	They are not 100% effective, even if you use them right.<br>  <br>  Get a test.|`|Jime0cdqaa	I've almost always had a super regular period for years (I mean within hours). However, I've been realllly late for crazy things like traveling to my mom's house a few states away or stress over random things. Try the dollar tree tests. They only cost a dollar and work well. Good luck.|`|e8259d706e4c0ff624821e09f8c00d53aa	Why dont you take a test before you freak out.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Just take a pregnancy test|`|VEkkn2Otaa	TAKE A FREAKIN TEST
2ibfQbLcaa	theres no rules, you can if you want to, Its personal opinion adn obviously there is no way to come up with a definite yes or no, Just Do what you feel comfortable with, Sometimes I have money to give gifts and sometimes i dont, Most targets now have a dollar section in fron with tons of baby books and socks, etc, but her some dollar stuff and some binkies and wrap it with some bright tissue paper, cheap, looks nice, and you wont have to worry that you didnt get her anything because you were broke, or had already bought her a large gift, My friend did the same thing, her second baby shower in in two weeks and her last was just 18 months ago and I've already bought her big things, this time I just made her a blanket for 10 bucks. Believe me she already has a lot of it wont be a big  deal if she doenst get some huge/super nice gift from you.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I thought you were allowed to have a baby shower for each baby...but apparently you're only supposed to have a baby shower for your FIRST baby and then all subsequent babies I guess are just not supposed to be showerd with gifts? I dunno... <br>  <br>  At least it's not like my sister in law! She had 2 baby showers for her FIRST baby! And then had another baby shower for her second child which was born the following year! So I thought that was a little excessive because she had 3 baby showers in 2 years which is kind of selfish and greedy if you ask me! <br>  <br>  I can see if you had a baby shower for children after you first if they were really far apart and you might not have all the baby stuff left over, but if they're close together and she has saved alot of stuff from previous pregnancies, then I woudl just get her a pack of diapers and call it a day. Don't blow money on her for the third time.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	A shower isn't thrown by the mom, it's thrown for her.  But it's really crass of your friend to allow more than one shower, unless they involved totally different people, like one for coworkers and one for family.  If someone was invited to more than one, like a best friend, she should make it clear that she only wanted their company and didn't expect additional gifts.<br>  <br>  It is seriously tacky to go trolling for extra gifts.  Just because behavior has become common does not mean it's good etiquette.  It's sorta shameless.<br>  <br>  RSVP that you're unable to attend.|`|kvYgopThaa	as far as I know you can have a shower with every new baby that you have. Of course this is my first pregnancy so I don't know for sure. I am having 2 different showers (my mother and her friends want to throw me one) (and the God mother of my baby also wants to throw me one) It would be rude of me to tell one or the other that they can't give me a shower so Im just having two different ones.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i was given four baby showers with my first pregnancy...but none of the people were invited twice....(some family attended twice though).  they were all thrown by different groups...work threw me one, my dads side of the family, my moms side of the family, and my church.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	I have always been taught you only have a shower with your first child. Yet my mother-in- law thinks other wise, but if they want to give me another when I have a second, more power to them, but I think it's kinda rude.|`|YRpKjrCdaa	as far as i know. your only suppose to have a shower with your first baby regardless of who the others are with.|`|gMxseQBCaa	I'm 5 months pregnant with my 3rd child and I will be having a baby shower. I had a new arrival shower for my first, but my second came just 18 months later. We decided not to have one for the second child. But it has been 12 years since my last baby and I will be having another baby shower. <br>  <br>  I think you should use your own judgement when deciding to have additonal baby showers for the same child. I think it's appropriate if you have a shower at work and one given by your family.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	It really depends I guess.  Traditionally it is only 1 baby shower.  However, this is a new family and I am sure they are excited about the new birth.  Our family tends to go with a large baby shower for the first child and then just doing a small get together (like a bbq or meet and greet after baby is born) to celebrate the new baby on the way.  It is typically just family and really close friends though.  I can't imagine anyone really have 3 extremely large full-blown showers though.  She should have most of her basics from her previous babies and usually people will still by something for the baby when they come to visit.  If you are offended in anyway then don't go. Or you can go and not necessarily take a gift, maybe just give a card and then when you visit the new baby for the first time take an outfit or a little something then.  This has only happened to me once.  It was her 3rd pregnancy and her first 2 children were still young and she actually registered for gifts for this shower!<br>  <br>  Like I said most of my family and friends want to celebrate every new baby but we do it in a more private way by just having family/friends over for dinner or something.  No formal invitiations sent, no decorations, no gift required (however most can't resist buying a baby gift).<br>  <br>  Just my opinion!|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Depends on who you ask. I am certain that a lot of people will respond and say "every baby deserves to be celebrated"- but I agree with you. A shower is a request for gifts, not a celebration of the baby. You should only get one. I understand that her new family wants to hold a shower for her, since they have not attended her previous showers, and they are welcome to- but I wouldn't feel obligated to attend if I were you. You've done enough already.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Personally, I was taught that you only have one shower for your first child and thats it. It seems tacky to me when people have them with each child. I guess it would be okay if there was like 10 years between your first and second, because you don't really have hand me downs at that point. But I have had 3 children and only one shower, and would not want anyone to throw me a shower for subsequent children. Its just a bit tacky in my honest opinion.|`|kzyEuRroaa	I had a shower with my first- a boy, as well as with my second- a girl.  When I was pregnant with my third- a girl, we didn't have a shower, and with my 4th, I did have a "get together". I was having a boy, but was not in need of much, except that I had decided to switch to cloth diapers.  I let people know I was registered online, but it was mainly for me to get together with my friends, as I wasn't planning on driving the 550 miles home with 4 kids for a long time after that.  My friends still brought gifts of clothes as well as neccessities- bath stuff, detergent, things you need for every baby no matter how many you have. <br>  <br>  I would say it's acceptable, because people love giving gifts for babies, and if her mother in law wants to do that for it's a loving gesture.  Just don't bring her a gift when you visit her in the hospital, or instead of buying something for her, make her a coupon book- good for a meal brought over, help cleaning, folding laundry, watching the baby, etc. Or spend the money on a gift certificate for her to get a pedicure (which I loved at 9 months pregnant).|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	These days its okay!  Very much acceptable.  I know tons of ppl who have had multiple showers.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	It is okay, as long as she is not throwing them herself...If you are unable to give a gift then just offer some help :)
tcHkn0VIaa	I would take a pregnancy test. the pill is not 100% effective.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	I think that you should definitely get a blood test done.<br>  you may have take the test & your hcgs levels werent high enough then.<br>  <br>  god bless x Blood test is 100% accurate x|`|GLJkGgloaa	Take a test. We are not Pee test, Doctors or Psychics|`|RjdrO7DVaa	could be ... those are typical symptoms ... it could also be a chemical imbalance ...take a HPT or see your gyno|`|FTcx2lBHaa	hmmm it looks so....take a home pregnancy test. That should help
SEzIkGNiaa	First get a CPR/Babysitters certificate/license ect...<br>  <br>  Start by handing out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children.  If you don't know anyone, ask people if they know anyone that might ened a sitter.  On the flyer put:<br>  <br>  Name<br>  Number or Email<br>  Age<br>  Rates<br>  Experience<br>  Availability/Flexibility<br>  <br>  :)|`|f98brCdxaa	well first off you need to take babysitting courses. you can take those at your local red cross or hospitals. They cost around 20-30 dollars. Then you need to get first aid and cpr certification. CPR is not a requiremnet but it really helps to know. And parents are a lot more likely to trust you if you have these skills under your belt. Then you need to find neighbors around you that have kids. Start by talking with the parents and get to know the kids. After a w hile you can give them your number and slowly work to getting other jobs. put your name out there. Be extremley careful while babysitting though. Its easy to sit on your butt pig out and watch t.v but if you want to be recommended, get paid well, and get called to abaysit again follow these rules:<br>  1: Even if your told to help yourself to food-dont! Little snacks are okay but pigging out will get you trhe boot.<br>  2: The kids want your full attention. play games with them, color, watch movies with them. Interact! If the kids give parents a good report then your more likely to babysit there again.<br>  3: Dont watch T.V all the time. Once again play with the kids-dont just pop in a movie so you can relax.<br>  4. be polite!<br>  5. Leave the house in better condition then when you got there. Even if the house was trashed when you arrived make sure its clean when the parents get back.<br>  6. leave the laundry to parents but if a kid gets a stain you can try and get it out.<br>  7. Dont be a pushover! Follow the instructions that parents have given you. Be tough even if they cry and say they hate you and your the worst! Parenst will respect you!<br>  8. be upfront-tell the parenst EVERYTHING! If something broke, let them know. susie fell down-let them know. you guys colored-let them know!<br>  9. Watch your mouth around the kids<br>  10. You have to follow the rules too!<br>  11.Dont EVER have friends over while your babysitting unless you have permission!<br>  12. look presentable. take out lip rings and dark make up.|`|56qI4CFcaa	i AM 14 and live in California too, I make about 80 dollars a week on average. When i started i was 12 and i just took all of my aunts uncles and neighbors that have kids and gave them my # and said i am looking for babysitting jobs. Its really not that hard. Don't charge too much or they wont want you back. I charge 5 per kid per hour. its pretty good and if they ask how much you charge juts say 5 per hour per kid to start or leave it up to them( they usaully say aroud 5 or 6 per kid per hour)|`|65RZ441Zaa	you have to like kids to babysit. If you have patience, and care for kids, start with some one you know, little cousin, a friends sibling. If kids aren't for you, start walking dogs|`|JSKBqjVMaa	Im 13 too. Started at 12...with a lil girl Emma down the block ...sweet sweet girl only 3!!! try talking to parents you know with lil ones tell them you are looking for work and you would love to babysit! Good luck!<br>  -Sam|`|GYwLGjt2aa	well because they probbley wan to learn how to earn ur own money. i think u need to be 14 but im not sure|`|cFfPVj9caa	start out by talking o parents and see if they have friends that need a bby sitter<br>  even just for a few hours<br>  when u do good they'll praise u and u can ask them to write u a letter of reccomndation so u can show other ppl u can do it
lHjXeN8oaa	first off, good for you for taking such good care of her.  :)<br>  <br>  i used clear blue easy because it is so easy to read - it is a digital screen that says pregnant or not.  they are not too expensive.  i would also wait to test until first thing in the morning as that is when the hormone levels are highest and you will get the best result.  you can test (generally) the first day of your missed period.  <br>  <br>  best of luck to you both.|`|zKRBNJiTaa	Congrats to u both.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	When I found out it was 5 days before I even missed my period cause I had to have a physical. But I did more tests at home and I used a bunch of different ones and they all came out positive. I even got some from the dollar store. They came out with darker lines then the more expensive tests.|`|1UrMbDZHaa	just having mirena taking out can cause some problems with her period. but to make sure i would take a test in a couple of weeks. so her hcg level is easily detectable.|`|60GBqgsDaa	Well if her period is still there, and just late, she should not be pregnant.
uP08b6K4aa	I think there's been far too much unsupported 'evidence' released by the british media in this case and not enough by the Portuguese police until it was too late.  When I say 'too late', it is documented that the Portuguese police didn't act upon the report as quickly as they should have, nor did they want to involve the british police as they probably should have for support.  It was also 'too late' because by this time the media frenzy surrounding the case had thrown every accusation towards the family that they could think of, and decided on all manner of outcomes and who was really to blame, leading the average Joe to believe half of what was being said by the media instead of knowing the facts.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would never leave my children in a hotel room in a foreign country, no matter how safe I felt it was.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, there is only one true victim in this situation and that is little Madeleine McCann.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	What do you mean why hasn't this been on the news? It was ALL OVER the news the world over. <br>  <br>  They made a mistake. They were negligent. I don't think that makes them murderers. Let's not do to them what was done to JonBenet's mother. After her murder, the mother was scorned and harassed to no end for years on end, and it utterly destroyed her life. She died a premature death, and afterward DNA conclusively proved that she had nothing to do with her daughter's death. <br>  <br>  You aren't a forensic scientist on this case, or Interpol, and your theory is just that.........your theory.|`|441GSyaMaa	Becuase they don't care about that, they care about the fact that a child has gone missing and how terrible this situation is...<br>  <br>  The media, don't you love it (Y)|`|X2eVfKc6aa	I think it was an awful thing for them to do but they gotta live with it and it will make other parents think twice before leaving their kids like that !<br>  Poor little girl =[|`|BEqAhXBlaa	it was<br>  <br>  many times<br>  <br>  this subject has been done to death<br>  <br>  .........................|`|qR2G2WcMaa	why on earth are you dragging this up?|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	This has been talked and talked about the world over but it was not just She who left the children  alone, It was they, and They are not the only parents who have left kids in a hotel room in the past. They should not have left them but they did and were not far away and she was taken.  This will haunt them for the rest of their lives.  What good will it do them or their other children if the remaining children were removed from the family. They know they have made the biggest mistake of their lives and no doubt all has been looked into. Lets hope the little girl will be eventually be found.|`|2fRtrXRnaa	this is old news,<br>  <br>  they stupidly left their child on her own and they've paid the price.<br>  sad, but something they will have to live with.|`|AA10341358	You say SHE why not THEY, I am sure it was a mutual decision and one they will regret until their dying day!|`|KwXLTZtjaa	yes its a conspiracy..

In your situation I think it might be a 50/50 thing...I really don't know!! Genes confuse me...lol.|`|1277dfe1019b5d50d0344a26a9def4ccaa	According to the simple pun nett square from high school level biology, your child should have blue eyes. That being said they are many, many factors that can contribute to eye color so although you have a much higher chance of having blue eyed babies there is always a chance of a "mutation" of green, hazel, and grey eyes. Congrats and GL!|`|mAxChwHTaa	nobody can say...  i know a family that everybody has brown eyes and their youngest daughter has blue eyes... :)
kY8JTDD6aa	It can apparently cause restriction to the baby's blood because the baby can rest on the placenta, if you sleep on your back.  Sleeping on your left side is the best thing, but the right side is not bad.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	sleeping on you stomach is nothing at this point...when it is it will be uncomfortable so you will know when to stop.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	the baby is a size or a rice grain right now ... its not gonna hurt it .. u dont have to worry about the way u sleep until half way thru ur 2nd trimester or when i starts to get uncomfortable|`|dXMdt3gVaa	You should sleep on your side (left side is preferable) when youre pregnant and not on your belly or your stomach. It takes a lot of 'sleep training' to get used to this. Maybe get a full body pillow to help you? <br>  <br>  If you sleep on your back when youre heavily pregnant the weight of the baby can cause your blood to not flow as fast to the babies placenta. So for maximum blood and oxygen and nutrients etc, sleep on your left hand side. <br>  <br>  This was so hard for me, I am a chronic stomach sleeper!|`|y4E8EoZ2aa	ok first of all it is fine to sleep on your stomach as long as you are comfy...when your belly starts to grow you wont want to sleep on your tummy. and second of all it is most beneficial to sleep on your left side....it allows for the best blood flow for you and baby. you need to pick up the book What To Expect When Youre Expecting...it will really help you out!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	It's preferable to sleep on your side. But not on your back - that isn't good for the baby later on in the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Try to get a body pillow or something to help you stay on your side and not on your stomach if your stomach is uncomfortable.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Nah it's fine.  I slept on my belly until I felt the baby kicking (24 weeks).  She is a healthy little tot.|`|SPMr3ZJFaa	no worries...this early you can sleep however you want.  Belly sleeping will become physically impossible long before it's harmful.  However...after 3 or 4 months you shouldn't sleep on your back as the weight your uterus can actually cut off blood supply to your baby.  But while they caution you about this, you would have to be on you back for a while before it would cause harm.  You will probably lose your breathe long before it could hurt the baby. (in fact later on you will wake up gasping for air becasue you accidentally rolled onto your back.<br>  <br>  The BEST possible position for a pregnant lady at any point in time, sleeping, watching TV, or whatever, is lying on your side (left is better but right is good too and you will need to change it up).  That is not to say you should park youself on the couch...just that if you are on the couch, you are better lying on your left side than anything else.  Many problems of pregnancy (water retension, viracose veins, etc) are solved by lying on your left side...so sleep that way at night and you have already put in 8 hours a day :).|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's actually the worst to sleep on your back because it cuts off oxygen to you and your baby! You can sleep on your belly as long as you are still comfortable doing it because it wont harm your baby. There is enough padding to protect your baby from it. You should always sleep on your sides but if you must sleep on your back put a pillow under one side so your uterus isn't putting as much pressure on your spine. Good luck!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Nope in fact the only way you will be able to sleep at about 20 weeks is on your side, it is actually bad to sleep on your back after 20 weeks. Also its fine to sleep on your tummy until it gets uncomfortable. I am 14 weeks and I sleep on my side and tummy and back when I wake up on my back I just turn to my side.|`|3w7VztEWaa	Sleeping on your side is the best way to sleep but it's fine to sleep on your belly this early you'll know when not to sleep on your belly it will be uncomfortable and will feel like your laying on a hard ball.<br>  <br>  o and these people are saying sleeping on your back causes this and that. my mom slept and layed on her back through out her whole pregnancy and she had three perfectly healthy girls. and everyone else I know laid on their back too so idk|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I think you are fine at this point since you are only seven weeks pregnant.  But afterward I don't think it is safe.  There is nothing wrong sleeping on the side.  Actually my doctor recommend me to either sleep on left or right side as baby growing.  It helps with blood flow.  And as your belly will grow you will find sleeping on the side is more comfortable too.|`|Wl1TDK1Xaa	Hi,<br>  I am 31 weeks pregnant and I slept on my stomach until I was 27 weeks, as long as you are not uncomfortable it is fine.<br>  7 weeks is to early...|`|SVqjzEE3aa	you'll get used to sleeping on your back..I slept on my back all my life too...and ever since my hubby and I have been TTC, I sleep on my back just incase I am preg...|`|VnONzLjdaa	I am 19 weeks and 5 days and I still sleep on my belly at times.  It doesn't hurt the baby.  It just depends on how comfortable you are.  If it becomes uncomfortable then of course try to sleep in a different position.  My doctor did tell me though about a month ago to try and not sleep or lay flat on my back for periods of time as this may cause the baby to have a hard time to receive oxygen.
1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	of course you could be pregnant if you had unprotected sex... the discharge and the spotting could have been your period for the month.however,it could be spotting due to pregnancy and a reason as to why the test came up negative is likely due to it being too early to detect the hormones. wait a few days or so and re-test in the morning when you wake up-thats when your urine is most concentrated.<br>  keep this in mind though; just b/c you took a test and it turned out negative doesnt mean that your not pregnant. i know a few people that took several ept's and each time it was negative. they had to see their doc and had a blood test done. sure enough, they were pregnant.<br>  if it turns out that you are NOT, next you have sex make sure its protected sex unless you want to have a baby. birthcontrol is a lot cheaper then raising a baby. trust me.|`|BEqAhXBlaa	well then see a doc for feck sake like anyone on here can tell if your up the duff or not|`|F4rCjV1haa	well the vaginal discharge can mean you have a yeast infection.And some time your breast will get sore when your period is coming.And next time use protection when you have sex.|`|RR35cmBdaa	cann the doctor and see if u can get a preg test there as they can detect small amount|`|6e35aef5d4caa7f8581bc03a4dd91086aa	might be too soon yet.

I was one of the lucky ones who it just came off with no extra work but Not everyone is the same and it can be hard to concentrate on you and yourself when you have someone else to look after we as moms put our self on the back burner...Sorry we can't all be the Heidi Klums of the world who can afford a nanny and go to the gym 6 days a week...your mean!|`|yXGlmUqlaa	there are some woman who can't lose the weight.<br>  looking after a 2 year old is hard work, and lot of mothers put their children before themselves. My mom had me when my brother wasn't even 2, so there. There are tons of people who have their babies around the same time. <br>  after the children get older, then the mothers start looking after themselves.|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	After two years you can't use that excuse anymore I mean it is hard for some women to lose the weight but if you eat healthy and exercise if you want to lose the weight then you can don't make excuses.|`|xpstigPTaa	youradick....get over yourself.

I have seen the questions you have asked in the past. Maybe if you would back off of her then she would be happy with life and start caring about things and lose some weight. By the way how much does she weigh and then how much do you weigh? I'm sure you are not in perfect condition either.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	thats a good question...and true..yeah blame a miracle...I think its just the extra skinthat they got when they were pregnant..but some people go right back to a perfect body after giving birth...weird..we are all different..I hope I'm not going to be huge after I give birth....lol...I'm going to do some type of exercize so that I don't have to blame my baby....|`|AA11898615	God help the woman you end up with.|`|pJFb4LRlaa	why don't you talk to her about it, instead of complaining over the internet?|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Maybe when guys like you quit being assholes :)|`|fPuZGkmsaa	Ouch kinda harsh.|`|t4HXotwEaa	At first i was just glad that you are not my husband...then i realized your probably not married or ever will be. lame.

What about Taylor? Taylor Faith is adorable!!!|`|FoBLX9ceaa	um not crazy about the name, sounds like a little kid name and unfortunatly they do grow up so.... but if i had to pick it would but taylee faith|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	It's kind of cute.<br>  <br>  Taylee Faith.|`|ylAILdcUaa	i love that name! so cute and unique!<br>  Taylee Faith! :D|`|J3kkH8hbaa	i like Taylee Chelle|`|D0pQFlMIaa	It's ok, unique, but it sounds like a nickname for Taylor. I think I'd pick Taylee Elizabeth, though Elizabeth is a super common middle name. Chelle looks pretty but it sounds like Shell, or a nickname for Michelle. How about Taylor Chelsea or Taylor Michelle, and you could call her Taylee? Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. I am a therapist in training too!|`|viCI5Q0waa	The name Tayllee is a little unusual, but cute.<br>  I would probably choose Tallie, though.<br>  And the best combo is Taylee Elizabeth.|`|RlKvgN9Faa	i like. it's original, and cute. a nickname can even be made- taytay! <br>  i like taylee elizabeth best, but taylee chelle is okay too.|`|Btlr3Ij7aa	I love creative and unique names, but only when they don't look and sound made up.

1VOsRV8Maa	My cousin had a full blown period when she was pregnant... with TWO different pregnancies. I had a short period with my first. It's normal. and Your dr is probably right.|`|AA10147946	I didn't find out I was pg until 8 weeks (the vomiting gave it away and I took a test) because I had a "period" of relatively light blood for ten days.  It's possible, tho it's not a true period.  I also spotted pretty much daily until about a week ago, when it finally stopped.  But apparently, everything's normal, as I've had three ultrasounds already (they didn't want to take any chances, I had a m/c in July).  <br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	My aunt had a "period" her entire pregnancy.  I wouldn't go by what you consider you LMP...the ultrasound would be far more accurate.|`|AA10186411	My best friend had what was exactly like a normal period the first month she was pregnant.  Its definitely possible.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	You can still have what looks to you to be your "period" and still be pregnant. My brother's gf had her "period" the whole time she was pregnant with both of my nephews. She didn't even find out she was pregnant with them until late in the pregnancy, because of what she thought was her "period."|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	From what I have been researching, you can look like you have had a full blown "period" and still be pregnant.<br>  <br>  I think I might take a test.

WiKZcd58aa	Just ask him, "Can I talk to you for a minute?" He should come over to you and give you the time you need.|`|TSO8rQLnaa	get one of your friends to or just text him/get someone to tell him that youwant to meet him somewhere alone|`|wVACBi1saa	Passively waiting for a hottie to make a move is simply not acceptable behavior for a fearless modern woman like yourself. Sure, it can be a little intimidating to approach a dude, but it puts you in control of your dating destiny, and besides — guys really like it.
Bw1h5xAcaa	Here's the thing - stress is no good for you. You need to try to relax and not overanalyze everything and worry yourself sick. Nothing you can know or do will prevent a miscarriage from happening if it's going to happen. So try to have some faith. <br>  <br>  Yes, with most miscarriages there is more blood, it's heavier like a period (but saturating a pad per hour is not a miscarriage - that's a hemorrhage!) However there may be spotting or no bleeding at all with a missed miscarriage. I had a missed miscarriage and had intermittent spotting with brief periods of heavier bleeds, and never ended up passing the miscarriage on my own and needed a D&C. Now, I know that doesn't sound encouraging, but it is truthful that you could be experiencing a missed miscarriage. But you aren't going to know until you have an ultrasound to confirm if there is a heartbeat (should be visible by 6.5 weeks at the latest).<br>  <br>  So for now, all you can do is wait it out, like millions of women before you have had to do. I know it's difficult. Stay strong and have faith that your baby is just fine. Good luck!|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	You can test positive for pregnancy for weeks after you miscarry. It took about five weeks for my levels to go back to zero when I miscarried in June.<br>  <br>  I have had two instances of bright red, heavy bleeding accompanied by severe cramping during this pregnancy and the baby is fine. I went to the ER both times. This happened at nine and ten weeks, and I am almost 14 weeks now.<br>  <br>  Bleeding doesn't always mean anything bad has happened.<br>  <br>  You will have to wait and see what the doctor says.|`|IdWleKAyaa	Did they do an ultrasound? I had the same experience and unfortunately it was a miscarriage..but its different for everyone. The other thing it could be is cervical bleeding which is relatively normal in pregnancy..how many weeks are you?...It sounds like it could be something other then a miscarriage <br>  I hope its not a miscarriage<br>  Good luck|`|7xit1ogxaa	I know it is hard, but you will have to wait. You can try calling and letting them know that you are still bleeding and seeing if they will see you sooner. You need to have 2 blood tests done 48 hours apart to determine whether or not you are miscarrying. A urine test won't help because the hormone will generally stay in your body for 2-6 weeks after a miscarriage, causing a false positive. Some women experience heavy bleeding and others experience bleeding that is similar to their period. I had three miscarriages, with two of them I had extremely heavy bleeding. With the other one I had bleeding for 3 days that was lighter than my period. The filling a pad an hour is a rule of thumb for if you need to go to the ER, not if you are miscarrying. I will keep you in my thoughts and I hope everything is okay.|`|bsVyYuJKaa	I'm experiencing the same thing!!<br>  <br>  I'm on my first pregnancy and like yours my pregnancy tests said yes too but about a week later I was experiencing bleeding. Mine started light then got a little heavier than went back to light (like just wearing a liner kinda light!). <br>  <br>  I've been told that miscarragies will be much more blood though and have a white discharge mixed in with the blood.<br>  <br>  Monday isn't too far away though so I will keep you in my prayers and hope all is well :) <br>  <br>  Let me know what the doctor says!!
BRNNVcMOaa	relax stress can only hurt you right now. you are doing the right thing by calling the doctor. hope everything is alright. i'm sure it okay even if is isn't the baby is well developed and there is time to get him/her out safely. <br>  <br>  p.s. i fell once when i was pregnant everything was fine, i didn't even go into labor. i was 39 weeks. i feel on my knees then bumped my stomach.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i wouldnt worry too much, the baby is very well protected in there!.  i slipped on ice when i was about that pregnant with my daughter and had some cramping and aching. The doctor said it was probably just muscle strain/bruising from the fall and there was no need to worry unless i started having severe cramping like contractions or bleeding.  I was stiff for a day or two but otherwise just fine.|`|AA10468184	After a fall, usually physicians want to check you and the baby out.  They'll probably want you to go to L&D and keep you there (we observe you and the baby for 4 hours after a fall), to make sure everything is ok with the baby etc...|`|7KkTel7Oaa	pressure when that pregnant could mean a number of things. I was33 weeks and fell on some ice and had to be put on bedrest because my baby tried to come out. Just do everything your doctor tells you to do and be careful next time
RcchpBX5aa	We call my niece Charlotte... Charlie.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Yes. It's called you speak up the FIRST time it happens and tell the person" no, her name is Charlotte".  <br>  My son's name is Spencer and there were some people that wanted to all him "Spenc" or by his middle name and I told them upfront from the get go "No, his name is Spencer".  They finally got the point and stopped trying to "cute" the name or shorten it to something ridiculous that wasn't really his name. <br>  <br>  I love the name Charlotte and my husband and I love it for a daughter if we are so blessed in the future.  We've all ready determined we will speak up immediately if someone start's the nick name game with the name and tell them flat out "no, her name is Charlotte".  (Watch out because "Char" and "Charlie", "Carly" and "Lottie" are also nicknames for the name Charlotte).|`|86oPkfzOaa	It usually happens gradually, like when she is at school, her friend might say, "Hey, Char, look at this!" When she is younger, you can correct people, and introduce her as Charlotte, but once she hits grade-school, it will be her choice.|`|M2EKtjIbaa	I call my friend Charlotte "Char" so just use a name that can't be nicknamed. Like Sara or Courtney (people won't use "court" usually) or Taylor (unless the kids decide to call her "tay" or something)|`|mRQxlNH5aa	You can do it...always introduce her as Charlotte and maybe politely correct someone if they use a nickname you don't like. But if you're really worried, I wouldn't name your child that.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	You and her just consistantly reinforce the nicknames that you like and people should follow - except for the odd annoying super thick skinned stupid person. Lottie is so much better than Charlotte.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	no but Charlie is likely|`|FL67UPPHaa	My name is Charlotte, and I go by Char (no offense taken! :D). <br>  <br>  I think you can control the nickname by how much you encourage or discourage it. One of my friends started off calling me Char, and I liked it because I never felt the other, more traditional nicknames suited me (Charlie is too masculine and Lottie too old fashioned!). I embraced the nickname, so it caught on.<br>  <br>  If someone else gives her a nickname that doesn't inspire you, then it'll probably just fizzle out. You can call her by another nickname that you prefer, or use her full name. <br>  <br>  I think Charlie is the most common nickname for Charlotte, so if people are automatically going to give her a nickname it'll probably be that (drove me mad as a child!)<br>  <br>  When she gets older, I guess it'll be up to her and her friends to pick the nickname. But you can call her something different at home and with family, if you don't like it. I still think Charlotte is a great choice for a girl, I've grown to really like it. It's a strong, classic, sensible name, no matter what her nickname is.|`|CxRJwJsraa	Most people are going to call your child what you call her. And if for some reason someone does say Char, a simply repeating of the full name should be enough to clue them in to the fact that you'd rather her be called Charlotte, and nothing less. <br>  <br>  However, this isn't to say that when she gets older that she won't decide to let others call her that.|`|miFe45quaa	She will develop a nickname, whether you like it or not. <br>  You can always call her Charlotte instead.<br>  <br>  I know a Charlotte, and everyone calls her Charlotte. Not Char or Charlie. Just Charlotte.|`|KOcCenrEaa	just because you don't  like doesn't mean your daughter won't like the nickname.<br>  <br>  Call her something like Charley.<br>  <br>  I also have name I like Harrison but hate the nickname Harry.<br>  I have  just gonna call him Harris instead.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Welll im not a big fan of the nickname Char. but i have a friend charlotte and everybody just calls her charlotte.|`|140581050ff8e4e1837ed61c01214957aa	She could be called Charly or Lottie instead of Char =)|`|J9fxTGwKaa	I like Charlie as a nick name.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I would prefer saying Charlotte. Charlotte is not a name that can be shortened.|`|vhMe2oCGaa	my name is persephone so i was more than happy for my name to be shortened to sephy i don't mind other people shortening my children's names they will eventually choose what version of there name they want to be called <br>  Charlotte is a very pretty name and i agree char isn't but i do have a few friends called charlotte and they are always chars <br>  You could maybe think of other shortenings ie charlie or Lotte i have herd those before <br>  good luck and i hope i helped|`|XmJ38IE2aa	Just simply tell everyone that she likes to be called Charlotte<br>  sooner or later they will catch on...really it depends on your child's opinion. If she likes to be called something, let her go with it. If you don't like the nickname, then you call her Charlotte.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	Dont forget:<br>  <br>  Charlie<br>  Chaz<br>  Lottie<br>  Charls (not charles!

In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|qLBU4t9Zaa	I just graduated high school last year, from my experience guys have spurts between 8-9th grade, and again between 11th-12th grade.  I highly doubt he is done growing.  He'll probably get a few inches, maybe more.|`|kuBXTToGaa	there is nothing u can do its not like he is short and the possibility of him growing is slim to none hell ive been the same height since i was 12|`|gY3wh4psaa	That's quite tall for a 14 yr old! I stopped growing at 21! I'm only 5ft2"|`|6DUEgAezaa	he'll definitely get taller. men usually stop growing around  eighteen years. 5.6' is actually tall for a fourteen year old, so i'd say he's right on track.
1VOsRV8Maa	I was the kind of first time mom who would call the dr over EVERYTHING! LOL! I called because my baby felt like he wasn't kicking. My ob/gyn told me to eat a meal or drink some orange juice, then go lay on my left side. If you don't feel at least 10 movements (kicks, punches, flutters, turns, twists, etc), little or big, in the course of an hour, then get nervous. My dr also reminded me that if I had a really busy day, it's possible that either all my movement was rocking the baby to sleep, or I just couldn't feel him cause I was too distracted. Try the "10 in and hour" thing. If you don't feel anything, call your dr. Good luck and God bless! I'm sure your baby is fine!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It can depend on your baby and when their active time is. A lot of babies often sleep all day because you're up and moving and the movement puts them to sleep. You can try to drink some orange juice or something sweet and lay down and see if your baby kicks then. Don't worry about the weight. I'll be 23 weeks tomorrow and I'm down 5lbs. Make sure you mention it to you Dr. Usually at the beginning of my appointment they always ask if the fetal movements are ok. I'm guessing you'll be seeing them next week for you 24 week appointment so I would talk to them about it.|`|6bc1daa67c2e712a9d1fdf83a2a7f067aa	Every pregnancy is different but the dr do tell you to count kicks when you further along try laying on your side while drinking sunny d or orange juice wait a few min and see if he moves that is what my nure use to tell ,me to do good luck|`|SJqgoGPUaa	Call your doctor right away. have him or her ultrasound to see if your baby is active and healthy enough if not your far enough along for them to save your baby. I wish you the best, god bless.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	call your doctor.....both of my kids is very active so they kick all time when I had them.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	babys are different..he's probably sleeping...or just lazy....you'll be fine...|`|NV5CQU8Taa	try to drink something that has very high sugar content and then check if he starts kicking. Also call your doc.|`|fhRyiIp1aa	Yea, i would say go to the doctors.<br>  <br>  Might just have a Lazy Baby... My son was that way and didn't move much either.
SRzswqTeaa	Yes, my first was born with no meds - as were the next five.  They didn't offer epidurals at my hospital with my first child, so my only option for pain relief was Stadol (or perhaps another narcotic).. but I didn't use that either.  I was absolutely terrified of labor and birth.  I'm very thankful that I had the experience that I did.  If an epidural had been at my hospital, I may have never had the confidence to birth the rest of my children naturally.  It wasn't that long ago, that everyone gave birth without pain medications!  They lived to tell about it, so it can't be that bad :-)|`|bQTATDTyaa	I had 17 hrs of back labor which was pretty rough but more exhausting than painful.<br>  <br>  I had my baby at home with no meds at all. The pushing was easy because your body does the work, you don't even need to push just breath and relax your body does it all. With an epi you can't feel that so it's harder and more likely to take longer.<br>  <br>  Def get mentally prepared, if you are afraid and tighten up or don't follow your body then you will hurt. I had to walk for 12 hours straight only leaning over my counter for breaks until I hit transition, felt the baby in the canal (about 4 hours before birth), and got the urge to take a bath, then I delivered standing because it felt right at that time. I was only in pain when I tried to lay down and not listen to my body.|`|VFUdAtrHaa	My 1st time i went completely natural but it was waaaaay worse cuz i was put on potocin and mag. sulfate for preclampsia. i was 16 when i gave birth to my son. now im 30 weeks pregnant with my lil girl and i plan another natural birth IF  i dont need to potocin if i do need it im getting the epidural cuz it was VERY INTENSE and i know i couldn't do it a second time around.|`|ied3Ww49aa	my first time giving birth I did not have an epidural...I give birth to my second child in a couple weeks and also plan on having this one naturally. The pain is very hard to deal with...the contractions as well as the actually birth....but i do not regret it one bit.|`|caf50252033092f023c9a8b6fa7c0c34aa	I had my daughter with morphine. only a tiny bit to ease my nerves. I was also overheating. With this child (i am 13 weeks) I want to go natural.|`|dPULl5hjaa	1ST CHILD - drug free & I swore I wouldn't get pregnant again.  PAIN....IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!<br>  <br>  Oh, had 2nd baby - very shorter delivery - drug free - easier birth - PAIN WAS THERE BUT I MANAGED!<br>  <br>  They say, you don't remember your labor & delivery.  Like heck...I do as if it was yesterday.  Our 2 teens 13 & 16 !
mc6YtaRbaa	It means your conception date, the date you got pregnant is in October. If you have a 28 day cycle, then your LMP was around 10/16, you conceived around 10/30 and are due around 7/23.|`|qPCjUckvaa	If your conception date was in October, then you conceived in October.|`|4kJrDvDYaa	if your conception date is october then im pretty sure you conceived in october. wouldn't you think?|`|eU5Eth2aaa	If your conception date is in October then that's when you became pregnant.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	October, I'm 18 weeks and mine was in October. :)|`|72SrLDQ3aa	October
SEzIkGNiaa	Pinyata (sp?)  I recently went to a birthday party (turned 1) and they had kids of all ages there, and pinyata was one of the games they played.<br>  <br>  Musical Chairs<br>  <br>  Pin the tail on the Donkey<br>  <br>  Treasure Hunts<br>  <br>  Egg and Spoon Race|`|AFi5kTiEaa	1-7 is a large gap in age, you could set up different games.  Potato sac race, pin the tail on the donkey, spoon race, bean bag toss, and have 2 groups, older kids and younger kids.  Get 2 people to supervise the two groups and let the kids spend 10 minutes and rotate to a different game.<br>  <br>  A pinata is great, I always have one so thats a good idea.  You could have a birthday egg hunt, and hide birthday(easter) eggs, good for all ages, tell the older kids to leave the eggs that are on the grass for the younger ones.  for the pinata, punching balloons and whistles are good to put in it, i dont like to put alot of candy.  punching balloons are always a hit at our parties, as well as whistles, annoying for the adults but it is a kids party!<br>  <br>  Musical chairs, red light green light, monkey in the middle, simon says, the limbo, duck duck goose.  If it is outside you can have sidewalk chalk, keeps them busy for a long time.<br>  <br>  You could make cupcakes and let them decorat them, give sprinkles, m and m's, and some other candy. <br>  <br>  Have balloons!  seperate.  if it is inside just let them float to the celing with a string.  I was at a party this weekend and the kids played with them the whole time, ages 2-6. if outside, have weights on them, they can take them home.|`|FkPP6NVeaa	You can find some interesting games here: <a href="http://www.toddler-net.com/B_day_home1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.toddler-net.com/B_day_home1.h...</a><br>  <br>  Make an obstacle Course for them: This can include things such as crawling under chairs, walking with a ball between your knees, and walking along a winding garden hose.|`|XDPEiV6Aaa	Karaoke!<br>  Ice cream sundaes<br>  Scavenger hunt<br>  <br>  :)|`|oxgjjyOXaa	a diaperparty
AA11296427	Aww, yes, i think you have started your period. Welcome to Womanhood :]<br>  <br>  Are there any pads/tampons anywhere in your house? If there are, use them. If there aren't, ask your sister or mum when they get back.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, put toilet paper in your nickers, and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|oMveOFi9aa	that is your period. i got mine only a couple of months ago and it was like that. ;) i know its annoying and you probably are disguted or happy or annoyed in general, thats how i felt. i hate wearing pads theyre so uncomfortable but you shouldnt start wearing tampons till your period is regular.|`|Bz6IZnoFaa	yup... you have started your period. not everyone gets cramps<br>  yayyy!<br>  now, try to find some pads,and if not get some paper towels.\<br>  then once your mom/sis comes home tell them, or if you have a convience store near by and are aloud to walk over there, then go get some pads.|`|IAejVIFmaa	Yuhp, thats definetely your period hun!<br>  Either wad up some toilet paper until they get home or find a pad under the bathroom sink or in your mom or sisters room.<br>  Its ok! LOL i actually started mine at a horse show three towns away from my house! so i promise, if your at home your better off than most!!<br>  lovelove!<br>  Jules|`|16bWGB14aa	It is your first period. Just go in your mom's bathroom and get a pad or get one of your sisters if she is older and has started. Tell your mom when she gets home that you got your period so she can get you stuff for it. When I started I felt perfectly fine too.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	it could be your period or you could have a uti <urinary tract infection> was this coming out of your pee or your vaginal canal. go check. if its only when you pee you should probably go get some antibiotics from your doc and if its from your vagina then its your period|`|3OP1YIXCaa	it probably is. I'm 95% sure it is.|`|QNnRVUoiaa	Yeup. It sounds like it ... Look for some pad ...|`|7jXChfBNaa	Yes sweetie i think it's your period for sure! you might be getting some crampy feelings soon but if you do just take some tylenol. if you have a pad just stick that in your underwear, i wouldn't advise that you use a tampon unless you really know how to. you should talk to your mom about that one.|`|6vqU5bv3aa	Yup it is just your period. Don't worry about just put a pad or tampon on and if you get cramps take a advil.|`|8CvWbN5Caa	Yup it sounds like it! The whitish stuff is just discharge but the brownish red sounds like it to me!|`|iKTi6A9raa	did you period Just finish?if so that's just what's left of your period..nothing to worry about..|`|524Dxtgeaa	yeah, it can be your period. I got mine 2 weeks before my 12th birthday. :'(|`|yV8fog7Paa	Probably. Wad up some toilet paper about 2" thick and ytou should be OK until your mom gets home, or look through her room to get some pads./|`|phw4ioR5aa	do u no where ur mom keeps maxi pads??  cuz if u do put 1 in ur undies pull the strip off place and press its tht easy.  hey im 12 and i've had my period since feb. of last year.   but if u dont no put a wad of like toilet paper in ur undies and u'll b fine okay.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, probably.  Are there pads in the house?  Use one, if you can't find one then just wad up some toilet paper and see if you still are bleeding in a little while.  If you are its most likely your period.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It sure sounds like your period.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Sure it can.|`|AA12127418	welcome to women hood :)
7XSPSy5oaa	Tell her to wait til she misses her period n take a pregnancy test...wear a condom next time tho|`|7xit1ogxaa	How about instead of telling her to go buy a test you go buy her a test. If she is pregnant your going to have to grow up and take responsibility. You can start by buying her test and then telling your parents if she is in fact pregnant.|`|juU6nJqUaa	She needs to tell her mother.  If it was within 72 hours, she can get a pill that will take care of this.<br>  <br>  If it has been longer than that then she needs to take a pregnancy test.  <br>  <br>  You need to buy yourself some condoms and stay away from little girls.  15 is way to young for sex, and pregnancy at that age could be physically dangerous.|`|O1nrRIuLaa	Just relax and see if she gets her period.  BE MORE CAREFUL next time.|`|AA10254927	Use protection kid!<br>  <br>  If its not more than 2days that u think u got her preg, ask an elder to get you the Plan B.... it terminates preg (if it is happening).

D0pQFlMIaa	My thought is that it would be super confusing to have everyone's names be so very similar, but it's nice that you are connected as a family through your names. Nickayla is nice, but the name Mikayla is so common right now that even using an "N", it feels over-used. But it is pretty. I'd prefer the spelling Nikayla. The "c" makes it look more masculine to me, like Nick and Kayla put together. Then it would match the first three letters of your other kids. Good luck!|`|xNSThNlOaa	I don't think they're ghetoo?

7ciw1aCXaa	It's not entirely 50/50 if you have some predisposition to having one gendered child or the other. The gender of a baby depends on which of the father's sperm fertilise the egg, and it is known that sperm carrying X and Y chromosomes differ in appearance and behaviour. Either you or your partner's physiology may favour one type over the other.|`|8RfmosODaa	Yes it is still 50/50 just because you have more of one sex then another doesn't mean your gonna have the opposite sex.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	That depends on the man you having a baby with.  I think there are some men who have different levels of male/female sperm, but nearly all are about 50/50.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	I had this conversation with someone who had 4 daughters, she said she had read that once someone starts having children of one sex,  the chance of them having the opposite sex decreases.<br>  <br>  Not sure if it is true or not, but i know one family that has 7 boys and finally stopped trying to have a girl !|`|UYfqzCoMaa	It's always a 50:50 chance that you can have either. I am extremely lucky to have the girl that I do by my husband (I have another girl but my husband is not her biological father). She is the first girl in his direct line in 5 generations.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	Yes. Everytime you concieve it is a 50:50 chance of having either sex.|`|beec2f445a2f6c8a9e45a63f5ad1bbacaa	With the same father, It's more likely to be 55:45. The chances decrease the more of one sex you already have. <br>  <br>  To put it simply, sex is decided by which sperm fertilises the egg. The egg can only have an X chromosome, the sperm can be X or Y.<br>  Men usually have a slightly higher ratio of X or Y. Often those sperm are also stronger. Also your physiology might affect the strength of the sperm.<br>   In some cases the percentages can be so high you get large families where there are more children of one sex than the other. <br>  <br>  Good luck if you decide to try for one!|`|cotoE26Waa	In theory, the chance of it being a girl is slightly higher. But in reality its something along the lines of 0.0000000000000000000000001% increased chance. SO its practically 50:50 anyway.|`|XdYOoFb5aa	Yes even if you do a punnet Square it'lll still be 50/50 but a punnet square would be good to use if you want to find out traits.|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	I have 1 girl, 2 boys and another girl on the way, its just pot luck hun!|`|YR9h8p77aa	Yes, it's the guy that decides the sex.|`|A0tWlG94aa	yep 50/50|`|mztCPZxLaa	certaintly is.<br>  I have 2 girls, and just 8 weeks ago we had a little boy.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Yes, it's still 50/50|`|1Hrlhx7qaa	yes you still have a chance of having a girl
diT2WFfCaa	Chances are, you would definitely know if they were contractions.  They are somewhat painful, and regular.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are just a little big...you can often feel tight and sore towards the end of your pregnancy, with all the skin and muscles being stretched tight. <br>  <br>  If you dont' know what to look for, see your doctor!  Or if you aren't able to, at least go to a planned parenthood or other family planning or womens health resource center.  You need to know what is going to happen so you can be prepared to deliver as healthy a baby as possible.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Do you know anything about pregnancy? Contractions are what helps move the baby along down the birth canal. Your having braxton hicks, which are practice for your body. Its concerning to me that you dont know these simple things and your to be a mother.|`|POGZZmoUaa	How are along are you?  Contractions can feel like monthly cramps or a backache or a tightening of the bladder muscles.  If you are not due to deliver then you are just experiencing normal pregnancy muscle stretching.  Contractions will grow and you can time their length and the time between them when you are ready to give birth.
diT2WFfCaa	Definitely see your doctor.  Sometimes, a person just doesn't produce enough of the hormone for it to be detected in a urine test, especially cheaper ones that aren't as sensitive.  If you see your doctor, they will be able to give you a more sensitive urine test, or, more likely, a blood test.  Or try planned parenthood.  They can do the same.<br>  <br>  However, your doctor will be able to help you determine what is causing the weight gain and missed period if you aren't pregnant, so my advice would be to go to them. In most states, your doctor CANNOT tell your parents or anyone else what the results of a pregnancy test are, even if you're a minor.  <br>  <br>  I would consider letting your mother know what's going on, though.  Even if she is initially upset, she will be able to give you the support you need-after all, she has been pregnant before, and can help you as you body goes through all the changes.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|vue9NOhYaa	So... you've been trying to get pregnant but you can't go to the doctor because your mom might find out?  <br>  <br>  So... if you ARE pregnant, how do you intend to go on hiding it from you mother? She'll surely notice eventually. <br>  <br>  Either go to a woman's health clinic (like Planned Parenthood), or your regular doctor. They won't tell  your mother.<br>  <br>  EDIT: "They think you might have cervical cancer?"  And what exactly have "they" done about this?  If you have cancer, your mother would have been told, and you'd be undergoing treatment.  Sounds like you need to clarify what is happening with your body and your health before you jump into anything as permanent as early motherhood.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Some women never show on HPT's.  The only way to be sure is to take a blood test.  My 1st HPT said negative...so I took another 3 days later because I just knew I was pregnant and I got a positive.  Trust your gut...if you feel you are (not just a strong desire to be but really feel that somethings different this time) go to the doctor.  I went to Planned Parenthood and a blood test costed $30 and I got the results in an hour (in Texas).  Good luck to you!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I'm not saying you aren't pregnant, but you wouldn't be showing or gaining weight yet even if you were. Your uterus isn't even above your pubic bone and able to be felt or push out your stomach so that you show until you are at least 12 weeks pregnant. But you may be having some bloating. Which would explain the weight gain and bigger stomach. I would stop buying the dollar store tests and either go to the Dr and get a blood test or go to the store and get a name brand pregnancy test like First Response. These tests can detect a lower amount of HCG (the hormone you produce when you are pregnant) and can tell you soon and with more accuracy if you are pregnant. I personally would just go straight to the Dr for the blood test. This will tell you 100% yes or no. If you are not pregnant, then your Dr may want to do some other tests on you to make sure you are not having any other problems causing the weight gain and absent period.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	If you have cervical cancer then that could be a reason for the missed period.<br>  Instead of worrying about being pregnant, you should worry about if you are healthy.<br>  Get on the phone and call the doctor, NOW!<br>  <br>  And if it turns out you may be pregnant, you need to get prenatal care NOW!  Especially if you might be in your 2nd trimester.<br>  <br>  Stand up and be a woman, if you were woman enough to have sex you should be woman enough to face your consequences.|`|eytlIKITaa	Go to the doctor and get a blood test...  Good luck!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	two words BLOOD TEST. then you will know for sure :)|`|lHjXeN8oaa	first off, i would take a different kind of test - i had used a dollar store test with my last baby and it was negative when i was actually pregnant.  i would also call and make an appt with my physician.  If you are not pregnant you need to find out why your cycles have stopped.  it is important as there may be another more serious reason.  as far as the changes in your body, well, at least in my experience (this is my 5th pregnancy) you don't start gaining weight and having a tummy until you are a little further along than 2mos, but everyone is different so your body may be having these symptoms.  i guess the most important thing is to call the doctor - they have a blood test that is more accurate and can answer alot of your questions....|`|7XSPSy5oaa	Y are u tryin to get pregnant at 17??? Go to the dr..get a friend to take u..look up free clinics in ur area...u need to go even if ur not pregnant since u haven't had a period in two months...u mite jus not produced enough hgc..good luck|`|FYDw1rjlaa	Try a different brand of pregnancy test first. I would recommend using First Response Early Pregnancy Test because that want I use for my last two babies and my third on way.|`|VdnAH78Xaa	Try a different pregnancy test. or go to your health department and have one done.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Your 17 and your trying to get pregnant? Why? And why can't you tell your mum? She will see it sometime if you are.|`|YiDhb60Paa	go to the doctor|`|bsVyYuJKaa	It is important to let an adult know that you are possibly pregnant. If you don't want your mom to know you might want to tell a close friends mom or an aunt? <br>  <br>  I am 18 and pregnant and like you I wasn't sure how to tell my mom. I confided in my best friends mom who is like a second mother to me. She helped me get on prenatal vitamins until I went to the doctors and also helped me come up with ways to break the news to my parents. <br>  <br>  As far as the pregnancy tests go, blood tests are the way to go! They are the most accurate test. If you can get to the doctors or a clinic they will be able to help you. <br>  <br>  If you are really TRYING to have a baby you need to take care of yourself and this baby and get to a doctor as soon as possible. Get on your vitamins as soon as possible. This baby is depending on you to take care of it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|z6icOivVaa	If its a $1 one then its defiantly going to be rubbish. Try going to the health dept. They maybe able to give you a proper reliable one.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped<br>  Mellia.
Bw1h5xAcaa	You can't get a blood lab unless the doctor orders it. So if you can find a doctor to order it, then great. If not, you'll have to wait it out like millions of us have had to do! Patience is a virtue - and you'll need lots of it once you're a parent! <br>  <br>  Best of luck, baby dust.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	u can  get test that u can take 5 days b4 ur missed period first Response.... iam not sure about the cost <br>  best of luck|`|SR1FN2nqaa	i know they do it the same way at the clinic....they use the same thing you would use at home. at a hospital im sure they do it by blood test though.|`|SmWuSrHYaa	I would try to take an early test tomorrow. I found out 5 days before my missed period. <br>       Good luck!
0yBRwdBxaa	I've read on a website that yellowish or brownish discharge is one of the more uncommon symptoms of pregnancy. So yes it can be a sign of pregnancy, but it's not a very reliable one. <br>  <br>  I was researching uncommon pregnancy symptoms because I also had been having yellowish discharge, bloody noses, nasal congestion which are all some of the more uncommon signs. A small percentage of pregnant women experience these.|`|AA10186411	It sounds like some sort of infection, possibly an STD, or other infection.|`|xpstigPTaa	No, it doesn't sound like it has to do with pregnancy. I have never heard of anyone getting this and then finding out they are pregnant. You should get that checked out by your OB. Best of luck!|`|bGRexKPyaa	Its a bladder infection..<br>  <br>  Like a UTI or a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  UTI if there is a slight sharp pain while peeing or right after..<br>  <br>  Yeast infection if there is swelling, itching, burning or any cutes...|`|VESdMODnaa	Yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis which is quite common when you are pregnant.
diT2WFfCaa	Week 27!  (I'm very partial to May 27th...it's my husbands birthday!)<br>  <br>  You should have gained about 3 pounds during the first trimester, and then between 25-35 from then until the baby is born.  More than that, and you probably are eating too many calories, or calories from the wrong places (sugars and fats, as opposed to grains, veggies and meats)<br>  <br>  Congratulations, and good luck!|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	You are about 26 weeks and 25-35 pounds is what the doc recommends I am 26 weeks and So far I have gained about 15 pounds...|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You're 27 weeks and 1 day! A normal pregnancy you should gain around 35-40 pounds!|`|6UBSUzUIaa	All pregnancies are calculated 40 weeks in duration. So, that would make you about 27 weeks pregnant. You should gain around 25-30 lbs. Also, you should go to a doctor!!|`|SJqgoGPUaa	CONGRATS!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  it varys for everyone.|`|mAxChwHTaa	go to a doctor...
z74wSbQoaa	If it makes you feel more comfortable then I would go with it.|`|AA11595906	Whatever you're comfortable with|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Whatever makes you, the parents, comfortable. I would look at credentials, and what other say about doctors. Try to get some referrals from different people, even your ob/gyn might be able to recommend some great pediatricians.|`|QrZcKRsDaa	The sex of the baby shouldn't determine the sex of the doctor you choose...I don't really understand why it should matter.|`|zBz10IiOaa	hi i have a 1 year old son and another son on the way in june and i will only use a female dr only because i feel safer but whatever you are comfy with go right on ahead|`|NroZQN5vaa	Which ever you'd rather. But all doctors do have an ethics code and you stay in the room for everything so I wouldn't be too worried. Our daughter has always had men doctors.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Not necessarily. You should go with whoever is the better doctor for your baby; not because they are the same sex. Male doctors are trained very highly for both sexes, not just whatever they are. But, just do what makes you comfortable I guess.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	You can. I used to work in a Dr office as an MA and I know that when a girl gets to a certain age they have her see a female doctor unless it is an emergency visit for a cold or ect.|`|Gj3vLQJAaa	I don't think it matters personally, my Dr. is a male and regardless of my baby's sex I am sticking with him.

But if its in good condition I'd offer a little more.|`|liWsDup2aa	That's a lot of money to spend on a crib. They are just going to get chewed on banged up and resold down the road. Think of how many other things you can get for your child with that money including the crib. for that amount you can buy a whole nursery set.
1thzSbS8aa	Saturday is way too soon to take a pregnancy test. You will get a negative result whether you are pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  As for the question of when you are most fertile---you are most fertile when you are ovulating. The whole point of birth control pills is to suppress ovulation so that you won't be fertile ANYTIME. If you haven't missed any pills during the past month, or taken certain antibiotics, there should be very little risk of pregnancy at all.|`|inxKRubVaa	Sounds like the only thing you can do now is wait and hope for the best. One way or another, worrying about it won't help anything and you probably aren't if you were on steady birth control when it happened. Wait until you're able to take the test and then worry about it.|`|CdkDVswJaa	YOu should take the test but It will not show until most likly next week. But hey what do I know.|`|WlwSQvE0aa	You could be pregnant. But we don't know.|`|16bWGB14aa	You are most fertile 14 days after your period.

But she said "she just couldnt do it" .. I dont know.. I think she never really thought about the children she had.<br>  She raised over 100,000 dollars to get the IVF treatment instead of putting that money into getting a bigger house for her children!!<br>  Argg she pisses me off.......<br>  <br>  END of rant :)|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	She certainly was not using sound logic when planning her family, but there is no way she could have anticipated eight babies.  At first I thought she was psycho, but we need to not put so much focus on her.  There are many, MANY people like her-homeless, unemployed, etc.-with children, and living off the system.  They do not get attention because they did not have eight babies at one time.  It is unfair for us to thrust her into the hotseat as the poster child for that topic.<br>  <br>  I have to say that atleast there is a reason she was unemployed (an injury from a riot when she was a prison guard) and she has an education, and plans to return to school.  While it might be easier to attack this woman, a little support is going to have better results.<br>  <br>  The children are here, that can not be changed, and we need to think about THEM-not necessarily her.|`|VVQv9GX1aa	Most definitely.<br>  She's just using those poor babies to get attention and most likely, money.<br>  She's not even allowed to take the babies home yet because her house is so run down and filthy - it was on the news last night.<br>  If she loved children so much, she wouldn't have done something like this.<br>  No child deserves that.|`|IkYQ6KP2aa	h3ll to the yea i think she's crazy she have 6 kids already she couldn't take care of .

My only advice to you at this point is to tell you to stop.  You are not ready and are missing the whole point of making love if you are actually considering being drunk to do it for the first time.<br>  In fact, it's almost like you want to have sex to get it over with.<br>  I understand you're not a troll, and neither am I.  But here are a few clues.<br>  If you still have to discuss it with your Mom, you're too young.<br>  If you have to check that you are above the 'legal age', you're too young.<br>  If you are so focused on the pain of having sex, that you have missed the point of the act entirely, well, you don't have to be young to make that error, but why do it if you've missed the whole point?<br>  If you are so concerned about the 'pain' that you post the same question, SEVERAL TIMES, you are just looking for reasons to avoid it, which is probaby a good idea anyway.  Because you shouldn't have sex unless YOU really want to, and are married.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to ruin your fun, here, but you are showing many signs of a person who is determined to do something they don't really want to do.  Why would you do that?  It's fine to be a virgin.  It's fine to make men wait.  It's fine to get some practice waiting yourself.<br>  <br>  Besides, condoms schmomdoms.  You don't have to look very far on this website to find 10 women who got pregnant on birth control, sometimes multiple forms of it.  And if you're worried about the pain of sex, wait till you push a watermelon out your vag - now THAT'S some pain worth writing home about!|`|GoVnb8ASaa	okay,<br>  well it's different for differend people.<br>  and DON'T get drunk or druged while you do it... don't you want to remember your first time?!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	If you can't put a tampon in because of the pain, you'd be in tears if you had sex.

This would be pending on many things if there was a lot of foreplay and a fair amount of lube being used it would make it a lot easier. it also pending on how tight things are there and if the hyman is intact or been broken though normal childhood playing. and everyone is different mostly I think that they would rate it as 2 to 5 but if they are not with someone that is caring then it could easy be a 10.<br>  <br>  Q2. not able to say <br>  <br>  Q3. might help but then if you where i would not touch you as that would again make it so that you could not form consent to it (I have refused with my partner for that reason and we are both over 30) <br>  <br>  Q4. good on him for saying no, it shows he does care about you and your rights to change your mind. if your under the influence of a drug then you have less control over it.<br>  <br>  if your having problems with a tampon then you would have a issue with sex I would think as most men are a little thinker then they are. I would sedgiest that you try something like for play first if he can get you to orgasms maybe that will help you with dealing with the pain, and i would think maybe let you go on top so if you decided that it was too much for you, then you have control and can stop at that time and from what you have said i do not think that he would have much problems with that ether.<br>  <br>  then if you do have to stop then try maybe something to help you stretch it a little at a time with him maybe a little finger inside you or something like that or even something out of the pantry and just keep adding to it or going up to something a little bigger each time until your bigger down there and are able to handle your boyfriend inside you.<br>  <br>  Good to see a teen that is talking to there parents that is truly a great thing that you can actually talk to them about this and that you are using protection too.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|tBtOTiQDaa	1.)

The second time hurt abit more. but it also depends on how tight you are down there. and that can vary from girl to girl. More active women can be more tight.

I mean.<br>  <br>  Before you have sex, you should work up to it. <br>  Knowing what it feels like to have ummm penetration?<br>  Having him use his hands.. <br>  (I'm trying not to sound gross)<br>  <br>  Thats my advice for you.<br>  Its really not all that bad, especially if you use lubrication.<br>  Donnnt forget it :P<br>  <br>  <br>  mm good luck|`|qK7UWH0Eaa	1.) It hurts pretty bad, I'm not gonna lie Probably like a six.  But after the first couple times you have sex, it doesn't hurt at all .<br>  <br>  2.) It feels like you're getting streached out, then something, very blunt ripping skin open.  <br>  <br>  3.) If your drunk it wouldn't make a difference.  Would you really want your first time to be with you drunk?<br>  <br>  4.) Would you really want to be drugged for your first time?<br>  <br>  It's going to hurt, but it's worth it, by far.  And after having sex for a while, you'll be able to use tampons (:
6qCnpxrNaa	Fruit juice (watered down) might be of help.|`|8kaDm2D8aa	i give my 7month old fruit in the morning, in the afternoon fruit or veggie and veggies w/a desert (if she wants more) in the evening.  she has noooo pooping problem.  i thought applesauce helped babies go.  i don't mix cereal at all, when i did she did have trouble going.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	You could try a whole milk yogurt.

It's less likely to cause constipation. You can add a little fruit to it as well. If she's eating really well you could try egg whites if there are no allergies in your family. Other than that, you could always just go with fruits or veggies with some formula or breastmilk. Those are 3 big meals a day. Maybe she's just getting too much solids and not enough formula or BM?? You could also add a little pear juice with a meal or two cause it works as a natural stool softener.|`|qHwI9ev8aa	Fruit for breakfast is great. You can try offering her some pureed prunes with meals and make sure her liquid intake is good. At 7 months your baby's system isn't up to processing all the foods available yet so if you notice anything making her worse just take it out of her diet and reintroduce later.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	Prunes are good but they don't taste that good. Pear juice is great to soften stools and tastes yammie too. I would have thought bananas were good for stools but I guess if your doctor said not to have them then listen to him/her. Fruits are great but your baby also needs vegetables. Give her plenty to drink, both breastmilk or formula and water. She should drink water with her meals.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|YTYrg3qlaa	Yogurt, jello, cake?|`|WCDaIP2Yaa	I used to feed my children oatmeal or  and baby cereal.<br>  Make sure you include all of their nutrients also.

oe7Cjbwdaa	Nothing. <br>  <br>  Really... It's not like we don't learn about blacks any less than whites. I think the whole month thing is stupid. We don't even celebrate it or do anything for it in high school.<br>  <br>  It's just... unnecessary.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it's kind of like saying whites, asians, native americans, etc never went through any struggle.<br>  <br>  :P|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	wezrxctvygibuhojnpkml,;|`|5tqh0akYaa	i think it means that it makes us realize how we are all equal and might as well be blind because skin color doesn't matter.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Absolutely nothing.<br>  <br>  I don't get a Caucasian history month.. and if there was a Caucasian history month, we would alll be racist.<br>  <br>  And like the girl above me said, what about Hispanic and Asian history month?  They did plenty for the world too!  Or how about Native Americans?  I mean, damn, they discovered America!<br>  <br>  edit: Okay, B, so show me Caucasian Heritage Month.  There's not one :)  So again, Black History Month means NOTHING TO ME.  It is unfair for every other heritage to get a month to themselves, except for the pasties.  And what about men?  It's still fvcked up.<br>  <br>  edit: No, I'm not going to whine about not getting a month dedicated to my race.  That's honestly really stupid.  Until every race gets their own month, none of these little heritage months are going to matter to me.  And men deserve a month too, if women deserve one.. right?  We can learn the same things without dedicating a whole month to it.  My school doesn't even celebrate black history month, or any of the other heritage months.  I'm glad, too.  We don't need to learn the same things every year about the same people.  Every race has dealt with heaps of issues.  None of us are special and none of us need an entire month dedicated to us.|`|A3zAXntxaa	Nuffin, they don't have National Asian month, so why should they have Black history.

As a 13 year old, I don't get the full concept of it. I think that if I had been alive during the civil rights movement, it would mean a lot more to me. I think that black history month is good because sometimes it's the only time that black people in history et recognized. (That, and MLK day. I don't live around black people though, so I think that at mostly black schools, they learn more about that.) I hate it when people say that there should be White history month when 80% of the U.S. population is white....  it's kind of ignorant. If 12% of the population were white, and we didn't learn about white people every day in history anyways, then it would make total sense to have white history month. I'd actually like to learn more about Asian and Latino history. I'd like to know what kind of things they've contributed to society. I'm sure they have months (I know Latinos do) but we never learn about them. The sad thing is that kids are oblivious to the contributions that blacks and other races have made to history. I think the reason why we don't really celebrate Native American history is because only 1% of the population is Native American. I live in the Northwest, so Native Americans are a large part of our history, and we learn about them all the time, actually. 93% of the U.S. population right now is either black or white. By 2012, there should be a lot more hispanics, and I think that we'll be learning more about their history in school. I've never done on black history project at school in my life.|`|vdpBlsfQaa	It means we all have to do projects becuase most blacks cant stop doing there retarded gang banging crap and write a book. Why do we all have to suffer. Why cant they just celebrate it by writing or reading a book. Where the hell is white history month, we fought in the early american wars that made america. I am not racist just telling the truth. and what the **** is spanish heritage month for. They haven't dont crap for us|`|5i1J2RLLaa	It means me remembering the hardships that African Americans overcame.<br>  <br>  Maybe you didn't know but alot of things were invented by african americans such as the traffic light, and Doctor IV's|`|okpAjss6aa	To me it meeans that it is a time to honor all the amazing this colored people have done and their fight for freedom.|`|lBINJvevaa	is it seriously called 'black history month'??? i'm in australia so we dont study it ehre, we might look at american history, or aboriginal histroy but thats about it..... we now also have black saturday thanks to the bush fires|`|ci9KCNp8aa	school work + stuff. lots of posters in my school.

I moved in with my boyfriend so we had 2 incomes coming in. His boss had an old trailer that he allowed us to live in. We only had to pay lot rent, utilities and phone bill. So living was really cheap. <br>  We then bought our own trailer like 5 years later. We made payments of 300.00 a month for the trailer, 100 lot rent and then had to pay utilities 200.00 a month and phone 50.00 a month. <br>  We still live in the same trailer (it's paid for now) I work in a daycare and bring in 1200 a month he works at a carpet store and makes about 1500 a month.  We have 2 kids, 2 cats and a dog. <br>  I think you could do it but, you need a roommate.|`|9qkCf6Mlaa	I was barely 17 when I was on my own.

It all depends on how responsible you are.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	My husband and I moved into our own apartment when we he was 17 and I was 18.  He went to school and worked part time.  I went to college and baby sit for some extra income.  We ended up adopting the kids we babysit because their parents didn't want them.  He was still trying to finish high school and work a full time job while I was going to college and taking care of two kids.  It can be hard but if you're responsible and a hard worker you can make it.  We are now 20 and 21 and still live own our own.|`|6DUEgAezaa	nowadays establishing ones self in the world i a lot tougher than it used to be. tell your grandma that she should at least give you a year or two after high school to get your bearings, maybe hold down a job and get some money together while she is still supporting you, then once you're ready, set out on your own. <br>  i don't see how she could still be mad at you if you're at least working towards getting out of the house. make a solid plan and show her that you're getting stuff done. <br>  i don't know of any statistics on that particular question though. based on the high school drop out rate, i'd say one in four?

n8vBnA9Iaa	Every women is different. You can feel symptoms really early. Some women know the minute they get pregnant, others a short while after, and most after 6 weeks. With my 1st 2, I didn't know I was pregnant till week 6.<br>  With this baby, I knew 3 days after it happened. I just knew. I felt very pregnant. I had all the classic symptoms. I just took the test to confirm it. This is my 3rd baby, I should know by now what it feels like to be pregnant and what the early pregnancy signs are. <br>  Exhaustion is a normal pregnancy symptom. An early one. But it doesn't happen to all women. I am 7 weeks, 3 days and I am not exhausted. At all. I feel quite normal actually. Some of the things I am feeling, I felt with the last 2 but those were my exhausted pregnancy's.<br>  You can test up to 4 days before your period is due. But I would test the day your period is due or a day or 2 after. Always use 1st morning urine.|`|7xit1ogxaa	No, it generally takes about 2 weeks before you would feel any symptoms. At this point implantation may be occuring and after implantation it still takes several days before you would be producing enough HCG to have symptoms.

P544Sbmqaa	Well, the prepaid cards first DONT do anything for your credit.  Next, they end up costing more than its worth.  You have to pay for the card, you have to pay to upload money, and you almost always have to pay per transaction.<br>  <br>  From a parental perspective, I would assume you wanted to buy something you really shouldnt be buying.  <br>  <br>  Your better route would be to ask your parents to open up a joint checking account with you.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Parents and teenagers usually don't understand each other, regardless of who is right.|`|2fRtrXRnaa	those prepaid cards are a rip off, listen to your parents.<br>  <br>  as for auto insurance, do you actually have a license yet ? thats why they may be laughing|`|1835675395f22fc2dabd44ad87bb6ac9aa	when you mention credit parents automatically think of debt! At 16 i would say that credit should be the last thing on your mind, I'm 32 years old and i have never owned a credit card (prepaid or otherwise) in my life and it hasn't harmed my credit rating.<br>  You need to show your parents that you can save and spend what you've got responsibly then they'll trust you to handle credit responsibly (don't forget prepaid credit cards are still pretty new - your dad might not even understand how they work, not that he'd ever admit that to you!) To him, the knowledge that you're already thinking about your credit rating at 16 is probably the worrying thing - the only reason you need good credit is so you can borrow more in the future and parents tend to think long term.<br>  Learn to work your parents a little, ask for your dad's advice sometimes....he might be flattered!

There is no rush to do this.  You are not going to have a baby in the next 5 years.  There is no reason you can't do this on your own after you grow up.  Something doesn't sound right to me.  Surgery of this magnitude should have full anesthesia.  I seriously would wait.  There is something going on here that doesn't sound right to me.  on second thought, i would wait if i were you, no matter what assurances the doctor gives.  if your parents try to force you, call child protective services.  i also don't know why your uncle would be your therapist.  this is completely inappropriate.  email me if you want to talk more.  hillarieg@yahoo.com|`|Jb1qmm1Eaa	I don't have an answer.

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	No it isn't dangerous. All women produce an ovarian cyst called a Corpus Luteum Cyst each time they ovulate. If no pregnancy occurs, the cyst will disappear and the uterus will shed it's lining, causing the bleeding you see during your period. If pregnancy does occur, the cyst will remain. It produces the hormones needed to maintain a pregnancy and it is what the baby lives off of until the placenta is formed. Usually they cause no symptoms and they just go away on their own after a few weeks so most women don't even know that they had one. But occasionally, they can be quite large and cause some discomfort or pain. I had some pain and they wanted to rule out ectopic. I had a very large one at my 6 weeks ultrasound and it was completely gone by the u/s I had at 12 weeks. If your Dr isn't concerned, then don't worry about it.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Im 21 weeks pregnant and have one ovarian cyst that is 4cm in diameter on my left ovary.  It has caused me no problems and no pain and my pregnancy is progressing as it should be.  The cyst is also shrinking each time I go for a scan which is apparently what they do when a woman gets pregnant.  You should be able to do anything that anyone else does.  If you are experiencing constant pain, please go and see your doctor.
Lr6uYg8paa	No it will not hurt the baby i am 24 weeks pregnant and i have 2 of them on my ovary!

Don't let him pressure you to kill your baby. He obviously didn't mind having sex with you and; if you play you may have to pay, shoulda gotten fixed or worn a condom if he didn't want kids. Don't let him into your house or answer his phone calls so he can't abuse you. Remember stress is not good for the baby ask your doctor about relaxation techniques and possibly help for you and your baby if your family won't. Good Luck Hon!!|`|Z8qBgv8taa	You can't force yourself to stop loving him but you can learn to love yourself and to realize you deserve better.

Have some respect for yourself and stop letting this unworthy loser treat you badly!!! The best way to get over him is to get away from him and try very hard not to see him at all for the first few months after you breakup. Every time you talk to, text, or see him it will set you right back to when you left, so emotionally you need to cut contact with him for a while. Ask for help from wherever you can get it, family and friends and ask them to help you to avoid him. Go after him after the baby comes and get some child support. <br>  <br>  It'll be ok. You are WAY better off alone than with this jerk. He doesn't deserve your love and caring and attention. Don't give it to him if he doesn't earn it. Remember that for the future with other men too. Don't ever give a man something: love, sex, etc unless he has shown you by his actions that he deserves it. You are worth more than how this guy is treating you.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	turn your cell off, dont email, and don't talk to him online.  I'm dealing with my baby's father who doesnt want to be involved either.  He wanted me to have an abortion as well and i told him to go F*** himself.  DON'T LET THIS A**HOLE TALK YOU INTO ANYTHING THAT YOU DONT WANT TO DO.  These types of males are what we call the scum of the earth.  LESS THAN A MAN!  best thing for you and your baby...leave him alone.  Rely on your family to help you.  File for child support and have a DNA test done so he can NEVER deny your child.  take him for whatever you can<br>  <br>  focus on eating healthy and providing for your bundle of joy...best of luck|`|YaEIVrQ6aa	Look sweetheart even tho this is ur baby daddy he is goin to cause u to stress out n lose that child it's goin to b super hard to stop login him cuz u can't jus stop login sumbodi on the dime like that but jus think about it if he treats u likethishow will he treat ur child jus ignore everything about him try to pick up another hobby to keep ya mind off of it|`|KfSjXY6gaa	If your blogging about it && asking strangers you obvioussly shouldn't be having sex in the first place!!! Muchless unprotcected!!!!!!|`|NV5CQU8Taa	OMG! I am sorry to hear that. Hope you work it out, tell him you will manage. (Hope you will get a lot of help from your family though!)|`|86a545b35caa16b409a8e47f9f7218abaa	Jesus says in Matthew 5:43-48 that you should love your enemies as well as your friends and pray for them anyway.  Hating someone and feeling anger toward him isn't healthy anyway, and can have a lot of detrimental affect on your mind and body.  Victims often love their abusers and identify with them; this is called Stockholm Syndrome.  You may need help with that.<br>  <br>  You need to get him out of your life. If he had sex with you after he turned 18, that is statutory rape, a crime for which he could be prosecuted.  You might also be able to get a restraining order.  <br>  <br>  You made a mistake. It happens, but you can get past it.  An abortion isn't the answer, I agree, but you have other options, such as adoption or keeping the child.  It's your decision, but if you do decide to keep the child, you will have a lot of problems you are going to have to overcome. College, career, time, money, and the paternal rights are all going to be issues.  Babies are never easy, married or not, but they are worth it.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to people who try to put you down. Bullies make themselves feel good by making others feel bad.  Remember, nobody is perfect, everybody has sinned, and all have fallen short of the Lord.  Screw them.
Vjem5OJhaa	If you are between puberty and menapause, and you have had sex (even protected), there is a chance you could be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test or consult your doctor.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	It is possible darling. Breakthrough bleeding<br>  try a pregnancy test if neg - blood test is way to go.<br>  God Bless x All the best x|`|ztzEloj5aa	it turns a out a lot of women have a period or bleed like a period and are still pregnant. some for 3 months some 5 some the entire 9 months - it all depends on the woman - if you think you might be pregnant even though you had a period i would test. Its the only way you will find out a real answer.|`|lJIzFC8iaa	My nipples being tender were the fist sign of pregnancy i had. then i had gotten my period which lasted only 2 days. Come to find out it was the implantation. It is very possible you could be pregnant. Best way to find out is to get a test. Good luck!|`|TnAIq152aa	If your period was normal after having unpro. sex i'd say no??? But in saying that our bodys can all be different!!!

diT2WFfCaa	Chances are, you aren't pregnant.  The day before your period is due isn't a very fertile time during your cycle.  <br>  <br>  Of course, any time you have unprotected sex, it is possible.  As much as it stinks to play the waiting game, most tests won't be accurate until at least 14 days after conception.  <br>  <br>  If you don't get your period soon, head to your doctors.  They can either take a blood tes (or schedule one if it won't be accurate now) and try to figure out why your period is so late.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You most likely are not pregnant from sex on Saturday if your period was due Sunday. Your most fertile time has probably passed about 10-14 days ago. If you had unprotected sex then and you still haven't gotten your period then you can test, but it won't be Saturday's that got you pregnant.|`|7xit1ogxaa	If you missed a period you can test. If you are pregnant you didn't conceive on Saturday, you would have conceived 2 weeks before that.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	You should test if you miss your period. Normally I would wait to see if I miss period before I test it. But if did the test and you're pregnant then it mean that you must have conceive somewhere along two weeks before your period is due.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	You wouldnt be able to tell that early. It has only been 4 days. Also you arent very likely to get pregnant when you had sex one day before you period is due. You would of had to get pregnant before Saturday.|`|JlboSK9zaa	Face it. your eggo is preggo....

irHF6CBPaa	CONGRATULATIONS If your fiance wants no part in your baby life then to bad I say from the moment I found out I was pregnant there was nothing or anyone more important then the baby growing inside of me Your fiance should have known sex no matter how much protection you use could lead to pregnancy Advice on talking to your fiance: Tell him you love him that you wish he could be apart of your life and the baby's life but if he wishes to walk away that is his choice and you won't stop him Tell him that if he is scare you could work together tell him if your scare(that way he knows he is not the only one) I suggest no yelling it will seem like you are saying "Well you got me pregnant you have to stick with me wheter you like it or not" Every  one react different to pregnancy news I was scare when I found out I was pregnant and I had been  planning for my baby for over a year good luck hope your fiance comes around being pregnant is the most amazing feeling in the world and sometimes it is also thehardests|`|o8xNTVWTaa	good for u ! ur not putting ur self in a situation that will make u upset and regretful. there are plenty of single mothers out there doing fine... just from what ur doing u sound like an amazingly strong women u should be proud of ur self and just know u can do this <br>  congrats on ur pregnancy !|`|nwHqblWiaa	Congrats! & best of luck to you. You are definitely doing the right thing.  If he doesn't want to be with you & help you then f----him! You don't need his help! ;];];]|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	Congratulations.<br>  <br>  If your fiancee wants no part of this baby, then LET HIM GO!  I am proud of you for wanting to keep this baby and not give in to him.  If he's going to be like that, then you don't want to marry a guy like that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|DNygQdmVaa	theres plenty of single moms out there that do just fine.<br>  So you tell than *** hole.<br>  <br>  And congrats! being a mommy is wonderful.|`|ZDnLfB5daa	Congratulations!!!!!! As for your fiance you don't need him, if he loved you he would not want you to get an abortion.|`|jcXSNjowaa	Good for you hun! go for what YOU want! congratulations!|`|IOp3knBjaa	I am sorry to hear that he is acting like that, but Congrats to you! All I can say is Way to GO!! Obviously he is not that great of a guy if he wants to try to make you decide between him and your child! Not much I can say that would instantly help you here, but I will say he doesn't deserve you, and definitely keep in mind that stress isn't good for your baby. Doesn't seem like he would be worth stressing over anyways!! I truly wish you the best of luck!!|`|4WieNr6Raa	My advice is to keep being the person you are and when things get tough, you think of your child and you will be just fine. I respect the fact that you are not contemplating an abortion to keep your fiance because quite frankly, his brain is not with him at the moment.<br>  <br>  Even though he's being an *** right now, let's just hope that he'll come to his senses real soon. If he doesn't and you are struggling financially, make sure he put in "HIS 50%" to help raise your child. God Bless you and your child.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Good for you! I am glad you are choosing to have your baby. Sounds as if he's not mature enough to handle it right now anyway. There are plenty of agencies to help, call birthright. Make sure he pays child support, after all you didn't do this by yourself. If he says yeah but I didn't want the baby you can reply then you should have worn a condom or had your nuts clipped. Hopefully your family (and hopefully his, I mean it will be their Grandchild)  will be supportive as well. Good Luck and Congrat's|`|PvnnWE1Baa	First of all, congrats!!! Secondly, if he claims to love you so much, he should be happy & supportive!!! This is his child too, he should be happy an angel has been sent to the two of you. If not, then screw him! I go for my 1st prenatal March 4th & I can't wait to hear my baby's heartbeat:-) Try not to dwell on the situation so much, because the baby can feel your stress. Everything will work itself out! God bless!|`|lHjXeN8oaa	congratulations!  if he can't support you and the baby then let him go his own way.  there is always someone out there who will treat you both the way you deserve to be treated.  best of luck to you!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Congrats on the pregnancy! And good for you for taking responsibility for the baby and keeping it :) Good luck.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	Well congratulations on the pregnancy. It sounds to me that you are very excited about it. I am sorry to hear that your fiance is not returning the feelings of Joy and Excitement. You never know this may come as a shock to him and after he comes to grasps with the idea he may change his mind. If not then it is really his loss. I am sorry that you have to go through this. I can tell you that it is not his right to tell you what to do with your own body. It is YOUR choice. Since he has given you an ultimatum it sounds like you need to kick him to the curb. It sounds like he is controlling and wants it to be his way or the highway. But like I said it is your choice and your choice only. Do not go against your beliefs just to make someone else get what they want. I think that you are brave to stick to your guns. Good Luck. I hope that everything works out for you. And congratulations on your baby.|`|s8VY7uReaa	congrats hun baby dust to u n everyone. let go of your fiance he aint worth it. As if he wants you to have abortion. his a selfish man, im sure u can raise your kid on your own.
LKu4YQZuaa	About 1% not even that.<br>  Dont worry hun you have nothing to worry about!|`|96HWpdkFaa	Not likely.
