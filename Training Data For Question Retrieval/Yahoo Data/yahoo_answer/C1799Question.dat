Costco wont hardly cover that. You would need a second house just for all of the food!       Is anyone else appalled at this ???

Tatiana Tye and Jazmine Finley allegedly both 16, forced other teenage girls aged between 14 and 17 to become prostitutes in a rented flat.      Police are treating the girls - both aged 16 - as adult suspects and have charged them with multiple counts of child prostitution, pandering and receiving the earnings of a prostitute.
