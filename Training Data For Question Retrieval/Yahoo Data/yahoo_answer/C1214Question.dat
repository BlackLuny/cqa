Okay, so here's the example question I'm going to use:      x + 2y = 4      Now, I believe (after some steps) this question can be rearranged into this:      4 - x = 2y      The last thing to do (or so I've been taught) is divide "2y" and all other values by 2. This will make "2y" into just "y". After I divide the 4 by two, I'll have a result of 2. But what about "x"? Do I divide that by 2 as well? And if so, how does one go about dividing a currently unknown number by the value of 2? I'd appreciate whatever help you can give me.

On closer inspection though, they weren't just bits of leaves but perfectly formed little cocoons shaped like bullets, around 10 of them all together, each made from leaves that had been cut by some insect , wrapped and shaped into inch long 'bullets' complete with a sealed leaf cap on the end.   We opened one of the cocoons to find a fat little maggot-like grub inside...interesting!   I wonder what kind of insect these little grubs will grow into that makes such cool, perfect little bullet-shaped leaf cocoons?   Having done a little bit of detective work, i'm thinking they may be solitary bee larvae..any thoughts anyone?

20090205125048AAReXTt	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How do I use the law of tangents to find angles?	I have learnt about the law of tangents which states that:   (a - b) / (a + b) = tan[(a - b)/2] / tan[(a + b)/2]      I understand how to use this law to find the lengths of sides, but not how to find the size of angles.      Can this law also be used to find angles? I don't see how it can if you have two occurences of tan both including the unknown angle.      Also is there is any cases where the sin and cosine rules cannot be used, and you have to use the tan rule?

Here are some questions. Can I write "the opposite of negative two" as 2? Why or why not?      My understanding of absolute value means the distance a value is from zero.       Let's pick an example: l -3 l = 3 because from 0 to - 3 on a number line, the distance is 3. But since the two vertical lines for absolute value are ONLY supposed to indicate the number's distance from zero, shouldn't it be -|3| = the absolute value of the negative number 3?

20090205120958AAx7qng	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	PLEASE HELP! CHEMISTRY is not my subject.......?	1.You place a balloon in a closed vacuum chamber at STP. You reduce the chamber pressure by half. What happens to the balloon?         It stays the same volume.   It expands to four times the volume   It doubles in volume.   It reduces in size by half.               2. A balloon contains 0.5 L of air at 101.5 kPa. You squeeze it to a volume of 0.25 L. What is the pressure of air inside the balloon?      0.25 kPa   102 kPa   50.8 kPa   203 kPa         3. When you squeeze an air-filled balloon, what happens inside?      There are fewer collisions of air molecules against the wall of the balloon.      There are more collisions of air molecules against the wall of the balloon.      There is no change in the number of collisions of air molecules against the wall of the balloon.         The temperature inside the balloon decreases.      4. You draw back on the piston of a pump and the volume of air in the pump doubles. Which of the following happens?      Half of the gas leaks out and the pressure is reduced.      The number of collisions per unit area is reduced by one-half.      The temperature of the room doubles.      The number of collisions per unit area doubles.         5. A pump contains 0.5 L of air at 203 kPa. You draw back on the piston of the pump, expanding the volume until the pressure reads 50.8 kPa. What is the new volume of air in the pump?      1.0 L   0.2 L   4.0 L   2.0 L

Vix= 9.97m/s Viy= 4.65 m/s   b.) flight time is t=0.98 seconds   c.) he will travel 9.76m during flight phase   d.) no he will not travel farther if increased to 30 degrees because no athlete can achieve such takeoff angles while simultaenously sprinting at near max velocity from a level surface.      are my answers right?? thanks everyone!

20090205155759AA60xg9	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics - free falling flower pot?	A flower pot falls of a ledge, after 0.42 seconds, it passes a window   which is 1.9 m tall. How far from the ledge is the top of the window?    The answer is supposed to be 0.310 m. Can you show me how to get this?    I got the final velocity to be 4.12 m/s, but I can get the distance to match the answer.    Thank you.

20090205162723AAf4Yzh	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	Flies, randomly showing up in closed spaces?	so for winter, we put up that plastic sheeting thing that helps lower your heating bill, right   there are three windows in the kitchen, about a week after putting up the plastic, a dead fly shows up on the window sill of the far right window. Over the next few months, more flies show up in the far right and far left windows. (We now have a total of 6 flies and one random bug) None in the middle window or the window in the other room. The middle window, is the only window that has a hole in the screen. question #1, how did these bugs get there?       Today, it appeared we got one less fly, and another one that was dead, is now perched on a vertical surface, with nothing holding him like that, so he has to be alive again, but he's not moving. The one we thought disappeared was actually hiding, but he moved a big BIG distance, and over a bump. These two flies have been dead on their backs feet in the air for like a month at least. Question #2: How did these two flies seemingly come back to life, move and appear to be alive but no longer moving?
