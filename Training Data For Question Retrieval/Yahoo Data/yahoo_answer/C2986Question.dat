20090129043800AAGvhWH	Environment;Green Living	What ways are there to recycle books?	I have recently been doing some volunteer work at a couple of charity shops, one of them throws the books that are unsaleable straight in the rubbish, the other sends them to be pulped. Now these books are still in good condition and readable but just not the 'almost new' condition they need to be in to be sold in the shops. It's great that one shop pulps the books as they will then go on to be made into paper and possibly more books but surely they could get more use before they are pulped or thrown away?

Certain alarmists either through a lack of understanding or through intentional deception have made the claim that there is no net increase of solar activity from 1945 through 1960, my observation of numerous proxies indicate that there was, what are your thoughts?

20090129050423AA4aGye	Environment;Global Warming	Why do people say the earth will get drier if global warming is manmade?	Manmade combustion yields CO2 and H2O and to a lesser extent CO, NOx, etc.  If global warming is truly man-caused, wouldn't the earth generally get wetter due to the increased H2O in the atmosphere?
20090129063002AAF8uZG	Environment;Global Warming	You opinion on community-based Q&A sites, do these sites influence ones perception on GW/CC?	1.) Have you ever participated in a validity or perception/credibility poll?   2.) Was any of them about environmental issues such as Global warming?   3.) Do you believe either these polls or your answers had bias?   4.) Do you believe participant's are chosen randomly?   5.) I'm also curious about the testing techniques used?      Thanks, for honest answers and this isn't a poll. Just your reflections about such.

A friend sent me an article that a company called Fraunhofer has produced solar panels that can achieve 41.1% efficiency.      Now taking into account the fact that solar do sent work during storms or night and greatly reduced during winters, what % do you think would be needed to supply a "majority" of our power needs as a nation?

20090129074717AAgZzza	Environment;Global Warming	If support for global warming is based on science and not politics ...?	then why can't supporters answer one simple hypothetical question; how many years must temperatures decline before you reconsider your position?  Or are you just too proud to admit you may be wrong?      I know that most men, including those at ease with   problems of the greatest complexity, can seldom   accept even the simplest and most obvious truth, if   it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity   of conclusions which they have delighted in   explaining to colleagues, which they have proudly   taught to others, and which they have woven, thread   by thread, into the fabric of their lives.   Tolstoi      Remember I am asking a hypothetical question.

20090129080114AA9aUw8	Environment;Global Warming	Is there global warming or global cooling taking place?	Do you believe Al Gore when he says humanity is killing the planet due to Global Warming and our "carbon footprint" or many scientists, including the Weather Channel founder who says "The last two bitter winters have lead to a rise in public awareness that CO2 is not a pollutant and is not a significant greenhouse gas that is triggering runaway global warming."      Is Al Gore just doing it for personal gain (fame, fortune, remain in the spotlight). We will all be paying more once Global Warming legislation comes into effect.

As part of the economic stimulus package shows us, NASA wants $400 Million for climate change research.      How is dumping more money into an agency headed up by a 'Shyster' going to stimulate the economy?  Heck.... if the "science is in".... why waste the money..... is someone trying to make his (Hansen's) empire bigger at our expense?      “$400 million for NASA scientists to conduct climate change research.”       http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...
