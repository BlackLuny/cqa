smDClNDkaa	He had a contract with another company.<br>  <br>  No there is no Nascar 2010.  Tanking sales and the exclusive deal expiring before the end of 2009 is the reason.<br>  <br>  Their excuse is Drivers and Tracks don't change so no need to make one.<br>  By that reason there shouldn't be any Sports game this year by EA but we will see NCAA 2010, Madden 2010, NBA 2010, NHL 2010, March Madness  2010.<br>  <br>  Also EA games suck and have always sucked.<br>  Time for a company who gives a damn and will actually put time and effort into the game to make them.|`|VS27UrjAaa	Wy would they want to pay him?

Carl was in 05 as a truck series driver though. If you notice, most of the truck and Nationwide Series drivers are either Cup drivers or fictional drivers. And yes he is in NASCAR 09.|`|AA10621709	Edwards Is in 09. He wasn't in 07 and 08 because he had a contract with another video game company. Of course their will be a NASCAR 2010, but i hope it comes out later than it did last year, last year 09 came out in July. And that wedge dude is lieing about Nationwide (Busch in 2005) drivers im pretty sure that the ones that aren't cup racers are real, like , terry cook, ashton lewis and yes Carl was in the truck series on Chase for the Cup|`|2BRZy8Mfaa	Wedge_Antilles_72 got it!|`|BIx0gbJ7aa	not sure but i'm a jeff gordon freak|`|B8MWJf9Taa	he was not in nascar 07 or 08 because he was a rookie and yes there will most likely be a nascar 2010|`|c3ce9f916abdade63289dc55a62d405caa	i have no idea

He was surprised to see the good and bad guys were all friends. Wrestling is a big money making show. That is all just a show.

8f7D95hHaa	Is it possible, yes...but in reality, it could have been one of many people.  I caught a neighbor (who I had helped rake leaves the day before) trying to steal my bike once.  Unfortunately, sometimes you can have your bike stolen, even if you do everything right.<br>  <br>  Without specific evidence, it's hard to accuse anyone like pg&e...my suggestion would be to focus on trying to get it back:<br>  <br>  1. Report it to the police (most stolen bikes don't get reported...just don't call 9-1-1, this isn't emergent)<br>  2. Look around...check out local pawn shops, ask at local bike shops (they may try to get it repaired),  Talk to your friends and neighbors about it too.<br>  3. Check online for it.  Someone may try to post it on craigslist or ebay.  Keep looking...they may post it weeks later.<br>  <br>  Also, here's a great blog to check out for other tips.  Good luck, hope you find it!|`|UVUYG5jaaa	its gone. who can you blame?.....why not someone else?|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Highly unlikely. I keep my bike inside the house.

fAMpwF3Aaa	I don't think so|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Every team that is an AFC or NFC champion receives a ring. The outcome of the super bowl has nothing to do with conference championships except that the two champions meet there.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Yes...The team itself (team owner) gets the Conference trophy and all the players get Conference Championship rings...|`|aaI48YR8aa	exactly as Bjorn says.|`|AA10047279	YES|`|SNI6tKqQaa	Yes
lCsaTd05aa	Ya man BullyWee humpt the posil jagars|`|MPqO1Qayaa	i wasnt at the game but was getting constant updates lol. Thistle were apparently battering Clydes goal line, and it was a shocking blunder by Tuffey that got Clyde the goal..being a keeper he is blaming the pitch but thats what they all say.<br>  <br>  Under the circumstances, with Thistle being quite regular goal scorers, to keep a clean sheet at Firhill while being under so much pressure, il say that they did deserve the points and well done. They have been on a terrible run of form and the three points today could help them avoid the bottom spot, but in saying that it all but ends our promotion hopes.
BB6HGbnPaa	Of course Kobe. Kobe has his on and off days. Wade has been to the finals "once"? Kobe has been to to finals a couple times when they had a really good team. So of course Kobe isnt going to score all of it. Back in the day they had Rick Fox, Brian Shaw, Derek Fisher, Shaq, and etc. They can shoot and now that Lakers about to get into the playoffs with people that can shoot in the paint like Gasol, Ariza, Odom, and hopefully Bynum gets back. Plus, they have Fisher and Farmar. Laker got this in the bag.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Yeah Wade has only been there once so he knew he had to give it his all.<br>  <br>  Kobe makes the NBA Finals often, so he doesn't really much try to score 40 a night to win the game.  Plus Kobe now has a better supporting cast.|`|v77SnunOaa	Just put it this way, Wade Never GOT BLASTED OUT OF FINALS THE WAY KOBE DID LAST YEAR!!!! 39 POINT BEAT DOWN by a guy in a wheel chair!

Wade single handely carried the HEAT to beat Dallas, where they had Josh Howard, Dirk, Jet, Devin Harris. we had a group of hasbeen. Plus, the reason kobe won ringss was cause of Shaq. notice how he failed to win it last year espeically that blow out by the celtics in game 6. And if you look at Kobe stats, Kobe stats always drop very low in the finals, showing he can not take over a game. In fact, he ruins the Finals|`|33cnTn1Laa	no match wade was clearly the best he gave one of the best finals performances in history<br>  <br>  WADE FOR MVP<br>  2009
yQWYe14gaa	You're kind of small for O line.<br>  At least where I come from.<br>  How tall are you?<br>  I think you should at least be able to bench your own weight.<br>  By the beginning of SO year, you should be doing about 300 on bench.<br>  You need to get bigger if you are going to stay at LT. Don't lose weight, gain muscle instead. At 225 you're going to be getting run over pretty soon.<br>  Our DE's are both 6'3" and 240, and they are rough to deal with if you are that small.<br>  Check out the body builder mags for good advice.<br>  Depending on your height and build, you may want to consider another position. You have to consider all aspects of your build and size, as well as what size you're GOING to be, in order to make sure you are at the right position.<br>  It would be a shame if you are a really good athlete, but don't get to play in college because you chose the wrong position for your size.<br>  To be a LT in college, you should probably be at least 6'3" and 265 pounds to be considered. At least.<br>  You also better be lightening quick to deal with the DE on that side.<br>  <br>  How much you lift isn't as important as talent.<br>  If you get the job done, that's all that matters to your high school coaches. Add correct size to that for college coaches.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine is the head coach at UNT. He told me a long time ago, if a kid has D1 talent, and D1 size, college coaches will find them.<br>  <br>  Good luck, kid...|`|aaI48YR8aa	225lbs. and you are a freshman. Dude you are a pretty good size for your age. I would guess that you should at least be able to bench 250lbs. I would shoot more for 300lbs though.

XhexwM1faa	I disagree on Minnesota. I think the Golden Gophers are probably in the NCAA tournament. Northwestern might even get in if they win 2 or 3 games in the Big Ten tournament, however, the odds of that happening are slim, so I think NW will be out of the Big Dance and in the NIT. Ditto with Ohio State. Iowa is obviously out of the Big Dance picture but could make the NIT. Indiana is out of both tournaments. Everybody else is in the Big Dance, including my beloved Michigan Wolverines|`|kYBlgFQAaa	I don't see the Big10 sending 7 teams to the tourney.   There are much better conferences out there and the Big10 isn't really deserving of that type of representation.  I can see maybe 5 or 6 teams making it.   There is no way Indiana or Iowa are going.    Northwestern probably won't make it.

Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  If you haven‚Äôt already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  Just search as you would every day, but WIN SWAG BUCKS as a BONUS<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|2XGIbCTTaa	Jeff Hardy is a sore loser!

How about Chris Paul who's numbers were ridiculous and is the best PG in the game right now.

CP3 was the player of 2008.|`|yt05KPhBaa	I'll say Kobe to be real. <br>  <br>  Then I'll say Ariza cause I feel like it.|`|ThcQK4zCaa	lebron|`|yO4vhNM9aa	lebron easy|`|kDNE2kw5aa	It has to be Kobe, he does it all at a higher level than any other player in the league.  He is the best closer in the game he players some of the best individual defense in the league, he is a great scorer and he does make his teammates a lot better.  LBJ is a scorer and makes teammates better, but he is not playing the best D and he is not a closer and not clutch.  D-wade is a lot like James he may be better offensive player than james and he plays good D but he is not as elite as Kobe is right now.

bR5Dzulsaa	I'm Welsh, and I'm not all that bothered about the success of the Lions anymore. After the last tour which was such a shambles I can't support them as a team.<br>  I want the Welsh players to do well on the tour, but for me the Lions isn't the same since Sir Clive had his way with things.<br>  <br>  That tackle was disguting, and it showed what's wrong with New Zealand rugby. This "It's only cheating if you're cought" mentality wrecks New Zealand rugby, wich is of course meant to be about beauty and power.<br>  <br>  My views on the tackle are that it was disgusting. Had O'Driscoll landed the wrong way Umaga and Mealamu would be in court facing a murder charge! It's one of the sickest things I've seen on a sportsfield.<br>  <br>  My hopes for the Lions tour is that no over the hill Englishmen are givn their place just because of their names. I hope the Welsh players that have been consistantly exiting for the last 2 years get their place in the team.I also hope that it isn't ruined like the last one by the media branch of the camp.<br>  <br>  I want good rugby, and I don't care who wins!|`|bGZ8vYuNaa	They knew O'Driscoll was a threat and they targeted him but that was taken to far and completely un-called for especially by professionals of the sport.<br>  <br>  Lions squad HAS to be dominated by Welsh and Irish players this time. I can't see many Scots getting a first team place and not very many English will either. Easy tournament win for the Lions though I recon 2-1
NXktxy8jaa	They Better Not drop it! It was a great storyline.<br>  <br>  For about four months, we have been seeing a setup to see Jeff Hardy go against his attacker at Wrestlemania 25. Many of us believed Christian Cage was behind it, but it was changed. Now we know Matt Hardy was behind everything.<br>  <br>  The problem with this feud is that it has not gone anywhere. After the WWE had Matt Hardy betray Jeff Hardy by hitting him with a steel chair, costing him the WWE Title, they have not done a thing.<br>  <br>  We saw both Hardys come out and talk a bit, where neither came out to address the other. Of course, I knew Jeff Hardy would not win the WWE Title back at No Way Out to set up the brother vs. brother match at Wrestlemania.<br>  <br>  But seriously, where are they going with this? I mean yes, we saw both saying they are going to move on. But come on, neither showing up with the other was talking? It is easy to see why we have not seen anything.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly, they had nothing for the feud. It was all made for Christian Cage. Now that Michael Hayes (SmackDown head writer) and Vince McMahon changed the plans, there is nothing for Matt to do.<br>  <br>  Sure they made up a little segment with Matt in the ring with music behind him while he was talking. And they had Hurricane Helms come out and try to avenge Jeff. But that is it.<br>  <br>  We just saw Jeff back the other week, and Matt was not even there. That would have been the perfect time to use a run-in or something. Help set up something for them in the future.<br>  <br>  Now we may see something this Friday. I'm not sure yet, only because I don't look at the spoilers. Nor do I want any one of you to post them here. <br>  <br>  But the problem is that it would be great to see Matt vs. Jeff at Mania. Only the WWE killed the Cage return to put him on ECW, but forgot that they had a four-month storyline going with him.<br>  <br>  Now they had to change it up, and they couldn't do it. Sure now they may now have something, but come on. Jeff couldn't have gotten attacked at No Way Out by Matt to show he really was the attacker.<br>  <br>  Heck, the week before Jeff came back, Matt said "I hope nothing bad happens to Jeff before he comes to SmackDown next week" Probably not those exact words, but similar.<br>  <br>  They could have used that as something to use. But NO, instead they did not have anything for the past week for either Hardy. All we saw was another Edge win at No Way Out.<br>  <br>  Sure Jeff pinned him in the first Chamber match, but still. There is nothing good going on here with the Hardys. All we saw was Jeff losing. Which sets him up for being in the brother vs. brother at Mania.<br>  <br>  But still when there is no real feud going in, then what are we seeing. Before we saw a nice set-up. And then we were shocked to see Matt hitting Jeff with a steel chair, costing him the WWE Title. But it ended there.<br>  <br>  So you killed the best storyline going into 2009? Why? It had the makings of the best wrestling feud of the year. How stupid to you have to be WWE?<br>  <br>  It does not take a genius to me. No wonder why B/R Writer Ray gets a good response on his "I can write a better series than the WWE" articles. Anyone can now. Who is writing this WWE?<br>  <br>  You have arguably the best two guys on SmackDown to use. Both are young and athletic with a ton of fan power. And you go nowhere with the feud.<br>  <br>  If we do see a brother vs. brother for 'Mania it would be the latest true brother vs. brother since Owen vs Bret.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	They Sure as Hell Better.<br>  If they Don't , the Entire Last 3 Months was Just a Big Waste.<br>  Especially all the Damn Promos , & Hype Over the "Attacks".<br>  That got almost "Orton/McMahon" Esq.<br>  <br>  I Would be Assuming that Within the Next Few Weeks , or Possibly 'Mania itself , They Will Elude to it Some More , Possibly Setting Up for a HUGE Surprise AT WM25.<br>  During the Hardy/Hardy Match - a Surprise Attack Possibly?<br>  Christian?<br>  Kennedy?<br>  Someone Else?<br>  <br>  I'm Sure they'll Do Something with it , Even Vince Isn't Stupid Enough to Sweep One of the best Storylines He's Had in Awhile , Under the Rug.<br>  At Least , I Hope He's Not...|`|bE5fG9vDaa	i don't know, but i heard that at wrestlemania all the questions between matt, and jeff will be answered.|`|dtpY4BEraa	actually he said we could not prove that it was him but we are to assume it was him. he spoke about it on the smackdown after royal rumble|`|aZXnW6AUaa	He admitted to it.|`|m68HTA4paa	well, everyone was saying that jeff had a black cloud hanging over his head when he was being attacked, and matt is now going around calling himself the black cloud. that seems to me as if he's claiming responsibility for the attacks. also, he said that no one can 'prove' he was behind the attacks, with the emphasis being on 'prove', which again suggests that he was the attacker.<br>  <br>  still, if they want to bring anyone else into the storyline, they've left themselves that option by matt not explicitly admitting to the attacks.|`|YX5zXjTlaa	It was supposed to be Christian, but because the news leaked all over the internet, the WWE decided to switch it to Matt Hardy.|`|YYTZvlgbaa	Matt said he did everthing because he is tired of his brother|`|zNajmAYFaa	Matt did it.

11i3Xmb1aa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  He has to see that most of his fans are wrestling fans. That's where he started. That's from where people became fans of him. If he would've not wrestled and gone directly to acting he would've not been a home name. <br>  <br>  Last night when he was promoting his new movie I was thinking that he should say something about wrestling, since hey it was during RAW. And was a wrestler and had/has a big fan base. <br>  <br>  He should stop acting like he is and give wrestling acknowledgment for who he is now. Forever and ever I will remember him as The Rock. Hence, even my own mother who doesn't really like wrestling knows who The Rock is and when she watches movies hes in she says "It's The Rock from wrestling.<br>  <br>  (:|`|WyPOnZdSaa	I Perfer The Peoples Champion THE ROCK! Not Some SellOut Actor|`|e3m3rdNYaa	To me He will always be the young talented Rockt Maivia. At that time He was a young (24) kid, just looking for a break. The reason I will remember him as Rocky Maivia rather than The Rock is because I think he worked harder and was more entertaining. <br>  <br>  The Rock was a main eventer, Rocky Maivia was a mid-carder. I prefer mid-carders because they work harder. The Rock could come out and talk for 20 minutes to get the crowd going while Rocky Maivia had to prove everything in the ring.<br>  <br>  But as far as his acting career goes, he should definatly go by the either The Rock or Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. <br>  <br>  Do you see Steve Austin going by Steve Williams? <br>  No... <br>  <br>  Does Hogan Act as Terry Bollea? <br>  No...|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	I agree there would be no Dwayne johnson without The Rock or the WWE who pushed him and made him famous when he comes to the WWE for special appearances he should act like the Rock and not Dwayne Johnson he owes it to the WWE and the fans that he at least shows his thanks and appreciation for them making him the star he is by acting the part that made him famous he should be like Stone Cold(a true Legend)who works in the movie business and the world of sports entertainment by making occasional appearances for the WWE every year he also shows his respect for the wrestling business by doing this I honestly think he would still be wrestling today if he could The Rock is the total opposite of Stone Cold The Rock ignores his past and by doing this disrespects the wrestling business and the fans that made him a star he shows no bit of thanks to the WWE for making him if he did he would be making some appearances for the WWE I can only remember him making one appearance for the WWE in the last five years and that was at Wrestlemania 24 to induct his father in to the hall of fame i dont have a problem with Dwayne but I do not like the way he disrespects the business that made him famous by ignoring the fans and his unwillingness to make guest appearances <br>  I will always remember him as The Peoples Champ The Rock and not Dwayne Johnson I respect what he has done for the business but do not like the way he treats the business that made him a star|`|m68HTA4paa	the rock isn't being a punk., he's just trying to realize his full potential as an actor. if he needs to lose the moniker 'the rock' to be taken seriously as an actor then that's what he should do. <br>  <br>  the rock's no fool. he didn't make it to the top of the sports entertainment world by being an idiot. he knows what he's doing.|`|oSMw5NFJaa	I totally agree! When he was like "Hey there Raw fans" or whatever he said, I was like he sounds like he was never a part of Raw.

It would not hurt him to make sporadic appearances on WWE programming.|`|hQj1s1Maaa	Since McMahon & WWE surely own the copyrights and what have you to "the Rock", I think he would be a fool to keep using it and have to give them a percentage of everything he does under the moniker.|`|Iq4qLnobaa	If he wants to be refer to as Dwayne Johnson then why should we complain.

jfEb0tIJaa	Guy Lafleur was the best habs ever.<br>  <br>  The Rocket was and still is a symbol of Quebec.<br>  <br>  The best Goalie of the early generation was Jaques Plante.<br>  The middle generation Ken Dryden<br>  My era Patrick Roy<br>  <br>  You can't compare these goalies on the same scale|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	The best player would depend largely on who you asked and what your criteria was.<br>  <br>  The most popular and most important player was Rocket Richard. He's the Babe Ruth of hockey that pretty much brought the fans to the game.<br>  <br>  Sam Pollock has gone on record as stating that game in and game out, the most valuable player he ever had was Henri Richard (Rocket's little brother), and his 11 Stanley Cup rings are tough to argue with there.<br>  <br>  The best player though, would easily be Jean Beliveau though. He had the most skill, best leadership and by far the leader in all of sports history in class. His name's on the cup 17 times as a champion (10 as a player, 7 as upper management) Darned near every star player in Quebec was wearing #4 hoping to be him someday (such as Lafleur and Mario Lemieux for example at various points in their childhoods)<br>  <br>  As far as the best goalie, Patrick Roy has to be the choice, ahead of Plante and Dryden of course. There are others that were great, as the Habs, like no other team, have dominated the goalies within the NHL's history, but Roy's 3 Conn Smythes speak volumes about when he was at his best, and that's what really matters. Roy's cups were won with far weaker supporting casts than Plante or Dryden ever had.|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	Best player Maurice Richard.<br>  <br>  Best goalie is easier Georges Vezina.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Best Player: Maurice Richard<br>  <br>  Best Goaltender: Jacques Plante<br>  <br>  To the person who said Vezina..............compare Vezina's numbers to other goaltenders of his era.  He was pretty bad.  Montreal was a bad team at the time too.  Vezina has a trophy after him simply because he died during his playing days and someone (a couple of people actually) donated a trophy in his name.<br>  <br>  Was Bill Masterton the most dedicated man to play in the NHL?  Hell no, he was a career minor leaguer longer than I was and only made it to the NHL because the league doubled in size.  Unfortunately Bill had a bad accident, and died as a result.  Again, someone donated a trophy (Alan Eagleson in this case) and named it after him.  It really should be the Mario Lemieux or Cam Neely trophy if they really wanted to create a trophy for perserverance and dedication.<br>  <br>  LITY's 2nd Rant

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	It was arena accessibility. The Minnesota North Stars played at the Met Centre in Bloomington. In 1967, it was fairly easy to get to from the airport and from downtown Minneapolis-St. Paul. Over the course of the next 20 years, that all changed and the then owners of the team (the Gund Brothers) started negotiating with the city to move into the newly built Target Centre. They used the leverage of moving the team to San Francisco. In an effort to keep the team in Minnesota, John Ziegler agreed to ratify a sale of the team to a group led by Hartford Whalers owner Howard Baldwin, and his partner Morris Belzer (who wanted a bay area team too) and give the Gunds first crack at a Bay Area team (now known as the San Jose Sharks).<br>  <br>  Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzer wanted no part of Minneapolis-St. Paul and sold the team to minority Calgary Flames owner Norm Green. (Baldwin and Belzer went on to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins and drive them into bankruptcy).<br>  <br>  Norm Green picked up the fight to move to the Target Centre. After continually being rebuffed (and the owners of the Met Centre selling the building and the land to a developer to build the mall of America), Green reached a deal with the City of Dallas to move the team there. The only other options at that time were to pay the lease on the Target Centre (Which would have been the highest at the time in the NHL) or fold the team due to poor attendance.<br>  <br>  Of Note: Broadcaster Al Shaver refused to refer to the team as the Minnesota Stars after the official name change in 1991<br>  <br>  <br>  Mark E................During the class action suit brouaght against Norm Green, Howard Baldwin, and the Gund family, all parties (including the developer) denied that Green had asked to have the Met Centre connected to the Mall of America.  The developers had informed the Gund family many years prior that they would need to move the team.|`|YN8Rbjogaa	they left in the early 90's because Norm Green, who owned the team at the time, wanted to get money from the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commision to remodel the Met sport center, and connect it to the Mall of America. After repeated tries, and being shot down each time, he finally moved the team to Dallas. I went to about 25 games that season, knowing that they would be leaving town. Minnesota is a graet hockey state, and I think that, even though I loved the North Stars, that we would never have gotten a new arena. The Excel energy center has to be one of the best hockey facilities in the world! There truly is not a bad seat in the house! Now, if the Wild could figure out how to score goals......|`|AA11196555	Another reason is poor marketing.  The North Stars tried to compete with high school and college hockey.  The Wild have embraced Minnesota's great hockey heritage and made it all part of a statewide family.  "State of Hockey" was brilliant from a marketing standpoint, and even though that is a slogan, I would say it is a true statement to call Minnesota the State of Hockey.  No other state can say the sell out every NHL game, sell out an NHL arena for their high school state tournament, and win college national championships with players ONLY from their state.  So don't for a minute think the North Stars left because of a lack of passion for the game by the fans.
HsJJ0xG5aa	The truth is that KM has many different "levels". Yes there are levels which teach how to deal with extreme situations such as a suicide bombing or grenade. There is also lower level which deals with weapons such as handguns, knifes and sticks*. There is then a lower level then that that deals with bear hugs, chocks, and strikes**. It is this lowest stage that will help you.<br>  <br>  When you are in a school fight you will have to deal with chokes, bear hugs, punches, kicks, and a lot more. In a school fight there is also a risk of escalation. Although this is a small risk it is best to be prepared to deal with a stick attack then not be.<br>  <br>  All of the information you need (and more) is available in official KM videos and book. The book is more in depth but the movies have the advantage of being able to see a person do it. I recommend both. Many people say that you can not learn a martial art from a book. This is true but KM is not a martial art, it is a self defense system. KM was designed to be learned quickly by using natural simple motions. With KM it is possible to learn the basic simple things that are in the book and movies. I did it and when I started practicing TKD I had to break a lot of habits I didn't even know I learned from KM.<br>  <br>  I should put on a disclaimer. KM does teach you to be ruthless. Each fight results in a groin strikes, elbow to the back, eye gouge, and anything else to cause maximum pain. Krav Maga is not set up as a combat fighting system (two guys fighting head to head) but self defense (guy attacking innocent bystander). The pattern they use is attacker attacks, victim defends attack, victim beats the attacker until he is an unrecognizable heap. This could also be said, Attack, Defend, Counter Attack. The counter attack is where they typically do the brutal beating. DO NOT DO THIS. Your life is not in danger when you are in a school fight, if you were getting mugged that is a different story but for a school fight DON'T DO IT.<br>  <br>  Finally here is my thoughts. If you want a fast, cheap, easy, effective way to fight it is possible to use KM. You will need to know what to use and what not to but you can still use it.<br>  <br>  The martial arts I would not suggest are judo, BJJ and the alike. You want a stand up martial art that you can fight multiple attackers. In the end I think that KM is not a bad choice.<br>  <br>  * stick= any long, roughly straight, blunt object; hockey stick, baseball bat, tree branch ect.<br>  <br>  ** strikes= any fist, foot, elbow, palm, knee, or head attack.|`|7kSRaDEOaa	Ok Krav Maga is used for the army. I would say train in Thai boxing or jiu jitsu I'm 16 years old I know what you mean and I have done a little krav maga myself and all it is they are teaching you how to take a gun away from some one it's more for the CIA and FBI find a MMA gym and have fun and don't go beat the **** out of some one because you think you are a bad mother ****** haha because there is always some one who is bigger and stronger than you<br>  <br>  Good Luck and have fun!!!!!|`|ULgO4VaEaa	krav maga is full of bs techniques, and unrealistic scenarios, any place that teaches how to deal with suicide bombers and grenades is bs, how many people throw grenades at you, that is completele ********|`|qf5XwXLqaa	I think Krav Maga is a bit too brutal for school fights. Unless they have knives or something.|`|aY8X0ZTraa	I'm not entirely sure about Krav Maga, as it seems to have wildly differing standards of teaching, with there being some downright bad commercial and exploitative schools (although many styles do, so I can't fault just Krav Maga for that).<br>  <br>  For getting yourself out of trouble in playground fights (that is, defending yourself long enough to stop the fight), I'd recommend a style like Wing Chun or another good Kung Fu style, or just normal boxing. Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu can also be good, but it is rare to find.<br>  <br>  An important thing to consider is how good the martial arts teacher you go to is, though. The styles I mentioned above might not be taught well in your local area, so you'll want to read up on what is available. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, all martial arts have some element of practicality to them (even Tai Chi, believe it or not), but it's about how easily they are applied, and how well they are taught. If you're looking at a style, and it doesn't look like it's something that could work in a fight, then feel free to be skeptical of it. But also remember that many martial arts consist of a lot of conditioning exercises, rather than just moves you would use in a fight.|`|ieUgty5Faa	Krav Maga is not for schoolyard fights. I've been in fights as a kid after school, and I've dealt with bullies. I've also trained in Krav Maga. <br>  <br>  Honestly, the mentality in Krav is that your life is on the line. Krav teaches techniques and emphasizes the mentality that you do anything and everything you can to neutralize the threat and get away as quickly and efficiently as possible. When I say anything, I mean anything, like attacking the eyes, groin, throat/neck... brutal stuff that's meant to not just end fights, but make sure that you're opponent can't get back up. That kind of stuff is necessary in some nasty situations, but a schoolyard brawl is not one of those situations. <br>  <br>  I urge you to avoid the fight, but if you get cornered and have to defend yourself, just throw punches, shove guys over and just do enough to get away. If a kid attacks you and you gouge his eyes out, you're gonna have to deal with legal issues like excessive force and assault and crap like that... Be careful about what techniques you use in that situation.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest Boxing if you want to train in something. But I would strongly consider finding an alternative to dealing with stupid kids... <br>  <br>  Talk to them, let them know that if they pick on you that you will defend yourself and you won't just be an easy target. Bullies look for victims, so let them know that you're no pushover.<br>  <br>  Or, just roll with friends. If they get you alone they might jump you, but if they think they might get hurt by messing with you, they'll leave you alone.<br>  <br>  It's not that hard to figure out what a bully or a bunch of stupid kids are thinking. They're cowards, if they feel like they could actually get hurt, they'll back off.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	Krav Maga has two forms,straight KM and Commando KM(CKM),not for school-yard battles.Look at Aikido,TKD,something simple that you can do to stop someone long enough for you to escape.|`|c4135808b48d589a16889fe0f1cecf39aa	Krav Maga is not suitable for school yard fights. However, it will teach you the appropriate techniques to defend yourself in a life-threatening situation. Krav Maga was developed for the Israeli army with an emphasis on hand-to-hand situations where it's life or death. It is designed to be efficient and effective in situations that you cannot avoid. <br>  <br>  During training, our instructors have always emphasized that if you can de-escalate a situation by handing over some cash (when robbed) or turn and run to safety, then do it before you have to fight. <br>  <br>  For school yard fights, learn some basic TKD. It'll get most kids off your back.|`|OURb1rnTaa	i would not say krav maga us useless based on what i've seen in the san francisco studio, but i will say that it does not seem to be that intense. that guy from  the movie "never back down",  cam gigandet, studies krav maga. why not jsut take a boxing or kenpo katate course?|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	Krav maga is an overrated crappy fad MA and is not worth the money you get ripped of for.try karate,ju-jitsu,tkd,boxing,kung fu or something simular.|`|SEkDK4DAaa	What the hell's krav maga?

Man u did control the first half, but inter came strong in the second, proberly from an inspired talk from the jose! The match in my opinion was fair and deserved the draw, although if any score man 1-0!<br>  <br>  2-0 would have been a bit harsh! Inter need to step it up a notch in the second leg as it is at old trafford but all they need is a 1-1 draw and would go through on the away goals rule! Inter will be dissapointed they couldn't win at home but man u will be also because they did not get a away goal! So still could go either way!!<br>  <br>  Paul seems to me you've given up on ur team, you betting on them to lose! Im sorry but thats not a fan, liverpool fans normally hate man u, but youve put a bet on them to win everything, and looking at them odds, 30/1 I think you would be more happy if man u won the premier league than if liverpool did!|`|a05e6eecbfbbdaff835948a23dc84249aa	not a hope man utd 2 - 0 inter<br>  <br>  rooney <br>  ronaldo<br>  <br>  utd are playing so well this season that no one will stop em . they ae so focused. i support liverpool and I thought at the start wed have a chance but theyve just steamrolled all before them ... if rather defensively.<br>  <br>  have a big money bet on them to win everything at 30/1 so more worried in the immediate term about spurs on sunday|`|q1hjMFtgaa	Yes, but its a slim one, they played really bad last night. United were unlucky to not be 2/3-0 up at half time.

LCgfc3LRaa	I'm going to run through the names of people that you shouldn't consider and why:<br>  Billy Wagner--retired<br>  Kyle Lohse--I'm not big on keeping pitching, unless you have to, and even then you have better options<br>  Phil Hughes--Just awful<br>  John Danks--Not a big fan.  Again, not one of your better pitching options<br>  Trevor Hoffman--Non top-tier closers should not be kept.<br>  Jensen Lewis--Doesn't even have the closer role<br>  Edwin Jackson--See Danks and Lohse<br>  Nick Blackburn--See Jackson<br>  <br>  Adam LaRoche--Not one of your top 5 hitter options<br>  Jayson Werth--Love the power/speed combo, but, again, not top 5 of yours<br>  <br>  Now, I will rank your keepers and give you a little analysis on why I have them where they are:<br>  1. Dustin Pedroia--Not a big fan of his, but he provides you with a ton of average and some nice pop and speed from a very thin position<br>  2. Joe Mauer--Top catcher available.  Won't provide you with great power, but is always going to drive home your average<br>  3. John Lackey--Aside from Webb, maybe the most sure thing you can get for a pitcher<br>  4. Chris Davis--Great, great power upside, average might hurt you a bit, though.<br>  5. Magglio Ordonez--I really like Magglio, but he isn't outstanding at any one thing, and plays a pretty deep position<br>  6.  Joe Nathan--One of the top closers available.  Again, I'm not a fan of keeping closers, but he might be the best<br>  7. Joba Chamberlain--Until I see the Yankees commit to him being a starter, I'm not touching the guy.<br>  8. Mike Aviles--I am a big fan of Aviles.  He provides you with a good average 10/10 production, and close to 90 runs.  That and he can play 2B and SS<br>  9. Jhonny Peralta--Good power at a thin position.  You can get him back in the draft pretty easily, though<br>  10. Conor Jackson--If he didn't play 1B, I would consider him a sleeper.  However, he does play the deepest position.<br>  <br>  If you keep Pedroia, Lackey, Mauer, and Davis you have a good leg up on average and some decent power.  With your first two picks you should target some speed and power.|`|gUMucKOkaa	It would be better to know the league size and the scoring rules, but absent that, here goes:<br>  <br>  None of your pitchers. You can do this well in the draft.<br>  <br>  Mauer - Top guy at his position.<br>  Pedroia - Ditto<br>  Chris Davis - I'm in love with him. You may be able to get him later if you want to risk it.<br>  I would probably do Ludwick although Werth is a consideration.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|piM3bj9Gaa	Mauer and Pedroia for sure.  I'd go Joba next as he has potential to put up big numbers if he stays healthy.  The last one is tough.  I'd would want it to be a starter as saves should be easier to come by.  I'd probably go Lackey.|`|560bTFitaa	Depends on your rules on keepers.  I'd consider Mauer, Pedroia, C. Davis, Danks, Lackey, Hughes, and Chamberlain.  I'm not sure Mauer offers as much value as his reputation suggests.  He's top 3 in catcher, but he only really helps your average.  Davis has alot of power potential, but he's probably a low average guy like Dunn.  Pedroia is young and a gamer.  He'll find a way to get even better.  To me, Lackey is an injury concern and getting a bit older.  Danks, Hughes, and Chamberlain have tremendous upside. <br>  <br>  If I were building for a championship this year, I'd take Mauer, Lackey, Pedroia, and Chamberlain.  For the future, I'd take Chamberlain, Hughes, Danks, and Pedroia.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider is trying to trade Mauer for someone else that would also be worthy of keeping.|`|WjIHp3WPaa	That's a tough one.  I'm going to say Mauer, Pedroia, Nathan, Joba.  In that order.  Tough call between Lackey and Joba for the last spot, also a tough call to keep two pitchers and drop Magglio, but that's what I would do since those are the 4 that I would want most for next year also.|`|eSL9tWnQaa	Nathan, Mauer, Pedroia and Ordonez.<br>  <br>  Davis would be your only other option worth noting.|`|S8BCApc5aa	Joe Mauer is a definite - I would put him in the top three at catcher, and it's a position where you can get a nice advantage. Just remember that you won't get power numbers from him.<br>  <br>  Dustin Pedroia works for me. He probably won't have the year offensively he had last season, but he should be good, especially at second where the offensive options aren't necessarily deep.<br>  <br>  After that, it gets a little dicey. I really like Conor Jackson, and I would definitely consider keeping him from this bunch, but I guess if you're in a league where you think you might be able to scoop him back up in the draft, you could risk it. I would say Jayson Werth, but the idea that he might end up hurt bothers me. Werth is probably good for 20 HR and 15 SB though, and the average isn't anything to sneeze at. Ludwick will have better power numbers at the expense of average. I would be very tempted to keep Joe Nathan because he's such a solid closer without having to worry about him. I think you'd probably have a chance of getting Joba back - Joba vs Nathan almost totally hinges on how much risk you're willing to take on. Considering your other keepers, I wouldn't be willing to take the risk on Joba as one of your top four picks - though I would definitely consider him if he came back around in the draft.<br>  <br>  So, if I had to make a decision, I would probably go Mauer, Pedroia, Ludwick, and Nathan. As much as I like Jackson, there are a lot of good options at first, and I like Ludwick's upside more than Werth or Ord√≥?ez.<br>  <br>  Also, to the earlier reply...Mauer and Pedroia as top C and 2B? Really? Brian McCann is definitely better than Mauer, and I would rank Chase Utley and Ian Kinsler ahead of Pedroia clearly with Brian Roberts and Brandon Phillips really close.

ccK75CR5aa	This is what you do. If the coach put in the 1st quarter and half of 2nd quarter of the game then you in to go is probably build your energy. So he/she can't bring you out the game doing the game maybe he/she can take you out the game if you tried or if you don't what you are doing on the court. But work hard at what you love and keep trying.|`|EcgzRGPwaa	Just walk on the court yourself, you don't need his permission lol.|`|9soK0R9caa	Work hard and make sure the coach notices you at college, never give up and don't become overemotional meaning don't pout or cry if he doesn't put you in

vzD4g2Toaa	GSM means grams per square metre. It relates to the thickness or density of the filling. The higher the number the denser, and therefore warmer, it is.<br>  <br>  Ignore that and choose your bag according to how low the temperature is going to go. You can buy bags that are good down to minus 40!<br>  <br>  "Grams" refers to the bag's actual weight--important if you're carrying it for long distances.|`|qyATAaeXaa	You are confusing fill with the weight of the bag. While usually a lighter loft bag will also be lighter in weight, what you really need to do is look at the total weight of the bag. It could be possible that a lower fill bag might be constructed of heavier shell material. Just go by the weight and the temperature rating for where and when you need the sleeping bag.<br>  <br>  Also, if this is just going to be a one-time-use thing, and you don't plan on camping much in the future, I'd say try to borrow or rent one from an outdoor supply store. It's cheaper than buying one.|`|KQpT68AKaa	I think that you will find gsm is grams per square meter. The example you quoted is total weight 700grams. Hope this helps.
ma4v8JnWaa	Well first of all it depends where you live. If you live in the States then you could probably search google for stores in your local area or online stores and have shipping. If your Canadian like me then airsoftcanada.ca and velocityarms.ca seem to be good. Also what type of gun are you looking for? Sniper? Pistol?(lol for wars)or Rifles? Rifles would be your best bet as pistols for war X and sniper if you want any quality then your gunna pay some dough for it. Thirdly there's also AEG (electric) GBB (gas) or spring. Rule out spring they'll be cheap but unless your like mister speedy hands you'll be destroyed in wars. More variety with electric so I'd stick with that. As someone already said, "with airsoft guns you get what you pay for" so with a small budget you couldn't get the greatest gun but you could probably find an AEG rifle for about 75-150$ that would be okay quality but make sure it shoots over 200-250 fps or it wont be that effective in wars. Hope you find a great gun! cheers.|`|MWvcl9tKaa	Well this shotgun would be perfect fo wars, I use it over my aeg rifles, because they hit harder.

CMUMhXaiaa	The best sports player is one who is well-rounded. When you play tennis, you are building up your stamina, using a lot of large, swift movements, and also working on your coordination. These things can help you with basketball. Why not play a game of hoops after every tennis workout, or before if you can?
Ekx7G30jaa	I don't like to use the term "assault rifle".  The anti-gun lobby uses that. They're rifles, plain and simple, capable of handling high capacity magazines.  They're not machine guns, as the wording of assault rifle would imply.  <br>  <br>  No, you can still buy them (if not in Kalifornia, where I live).  The ban has not gone into effect yet, but Obama, that piece of garbage, is trying to renew the ban signed by President Clinton in 1994.  The Assault Weapons Ban signed into law by President Clinton in 1994 banned 19 types of semi-automatic military-style guns and ammunition clips with more than 10 rounds.|`|UVYEu5Gqaa	I too do not like the term assault rifle, or assault weapon or any variation on the word when used to refer to a rifle. A rifle is a rifle just the same. I also do not like the term high cap magazine because it gives the idea that it has magazines that are larger than it was designed for. Drum magazines would be the exception as those are High capacity magazines. However, all of these military style rifles are designed to accept 20 to 30 round magazines, standard capacity.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question, no one knows for sure, the only thing that is certain is that tuesday is not the last day to purchase an AK type rifle. As far as private sales, again, the law isn't up yet, so its hard to say, I'm sure they'll make it so you can't.<br>  <br>  I'm glad i stocked up early, everyone called me crazy, now I've got everything i could want or need and they don't.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* No, not true.* " Only a Criminal, Tyrant, or Tyrannical Government is Afraid of American Citizens with Guns."..

The only thing is it must be done legally! If you want a sub machine gun, go get a class III-it is your right! Well, until Communist Obama has his way with the law. Remember-the first step in any Communist regime is disarming the population! For any gun-related info-look at NRA-ILA.ORG<br>  <br>  World Net Daily on Holder:<br>  "He cited Holder's known support for gun bans ‚Äì the former Clinton administration official endorsed the District of Columbia's complete ban on functional guns in residents' homes before it was overturned by the Supreme Court."<br>  "Note that ‚Ä¶ Holder ‚Ä¶ wrote a brief in the (District of Columbia) Heller case supporting the position that you have no right to have a working firearm in your own home,"|`|sWquRnVTaa	1st let me start by saying that civilians are already prohibited by law to own an Assault Weapon. The REAL definition of an assault weapon is a select fire (3rnd burst) or full auto firearm. Since civilians already cannot legally own them without tons to red tape, paperwork and signing their rights away to the BAFTE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), an "Assault Weapons Ban" is redundant. <br>  <br>  What has happened is the liberal gun grabbers have re-defined the term assault weapon to include semi-auto carbines. They make no distinction between semi-auto and full auto. After all, what do they know about firearms, most of them can't tell you what a barrel shroud is but want to ban it anyway. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGpykAX1fo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rGpykAX1...</a> An AR-15 or an AK clone are carbines and nothing more. Since they resemble the full auto/select fire rifles that are used by military forces, they are deemed "scary looking" and therefore have to be banned. The truth is that what these people call assault weapons are used in less than 2% of all crimes committed in the United States. <br>  <br>  Having said that, there very well may be a weapons ban coming down the pike. The Attorney General has said that he wants to make the 1994 A.W.B. permanent, implement microstamping of ammunition, build a national database of firearm sales AND "end the gun show loophole". That last two scare me because forbidding private sales of firearms AKA "ending the gunshow loophole" and by keeping record of who has what and where and how much, it is just one step away from confiscation. It has played out time and time again in the 19th and 20th centuries with firearms and throughout the centuries with arms of various types. e.g. The British forbade the Scots and the Irish from owning swords, clubs or any weapon so they could not rise up and fight back against the raping of their women and pillaging of their villages. For more info on confiscation visit www.jpfo.org <br>  <br>  Copied from WhiteHouse.gov under their Agenda - Urban Policy section<br>  "Address Gun Violence in Cities: Obama and Biden would repeal the Tiahrt Amendment, which restricts the ability of local law enforcement to access important gun trace information, and give police officers across the nation the tools they need to solve gun crimes and fight the illegal arms trade. Obama and Biden also favor commonsense measures that respect the Second Amendment rights of gun owners, while keeping guns away from children and from criminals. They support closing the gun show loophole and making guns in this country childproof. They also support making the expired federal Assault Weapons Ban permanent."<br>  <br>  For the latest information on what is going down in DC regarding your 2nd Amendment rights, here are a few sites from which I get my information. <br>  <a href="http://www.jpfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpfo.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nra.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nra.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gunowners.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunowners.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.saf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.saf.org/</a>|`|AA12034449	If the current Administration gets it's way that AK wont be the only thing you cannot get anymore.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	AKs were legal under the Clinton ban, but the number and type of features that you could have on them were limited and regulated. These were cosmetic features like a folding stock. Why a folding stock makes a rifle scary I will never know.<br>  <br>  Obama has stated that he wants the AWB made permanent. However, at least for the moment this is just his wish.<br>  <br>  As for the idiots saying that there is no use for them, I beg to differ. There are plenty of people who collect them just like people collect stamps and rocks even though they are pretty much pointless. They are cheap (relatively speaking) and fun to shoot. They also require minimal maintenance and you can indeed use them for hunting. They are no more or less dangerous than my Winchester .308.
Y3KMLdjWaa	Having watched a lot of new riders do this at skills clinics, the two most common things are lack of speed and the second being where they are looking. If your speed is slow it is harder to keep your balance. The second is where are you looking, if you focus close to your front tire you will go where you are looking.|`|9Y2Csr3iaa	You actually MAY have an inner-ear problem... it's worth mentioning to your doctor next checkup. But anyway, just practice riding. If you are embarassed around your friends then practice in a parkinglot or something. just keep a steady momentum while pedaling. Everyone starts out wobbly on a bike but u eventually get better and better, as with any thing else. So practice and see a doctor! :D|`|TEX1iYQgaa	You may be too tense.<br>  <br>  The more you ride, the more comfortable you get on a bicycle. Learning to ride a motorcycle is much the same way. Beginners tend to grip the handlebars tightly and they are as stiff as boards. The key is to relax and to allow your body to work in harmony with the motion of the bike. Your body learns or gets the feel of what it's supposed to do over time. Ride often, relax, have fun...|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Peddle faster and get your speed up, the faster you go the more stable you become. This is due to the gyroscopic effect of the tires spinning. Hence why bikers going really fast have to lean the bike in order to turn.|`|c95927564d204b722c528b5b71074e94aa	Go Faster. Your initial pedal (left or right foot) should be hard enough to get the bike rolling/coasting so you can get in a comfortable riding position. A lot of beginners try to place both feet on the pedals before gaining enough speed, making it harder to make that first pedal to "take off". Start with one foot (i started with my left) on the ground and your other foot on the pedal in the highest position (1 o'clock roughly). The bike should be leaning towards your foot thats on the ground so when you make that first pedal, the bike will even out and you will be able to place your left foot on the other pedal. Sounds confusing but just observe other bike riders on how they start. Once you start, keep pedaling. If you get scared, brake and once you slow down to a near stop, lean towards that same side you started on. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|YE87HP26aa	Bike riding is an acquired skill; it's not something you just get up and do, you have to ride a lot  to get the hang of it, if you can't balance you can get a three wheel bike so you won't need to balance it.|`|5s5qrYeKaa	maybe the bike is too big you should try getting a smaller size on the tier or a smaller bike :)|`|gkgPHzg4aa	Try to keep straight and don't lean so much on both sides.|`|IeLBIACaaa	keep your center of gravity as low as possible|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You might have an inner ear problem.

Clemmenson put up quite a good number of games in Brodeurs absence as well...|`|3ULjjUNlaa	Ty Conklin.  Biased answer?  Maybe.  There are other underrated goalies out there, but this signing (like Clemmenson) also got relatively unnoticed.  And both players have majorly helped there team, and still don't get a whole lot of attention around the league.|`|Fh0shlVLaa	Clemmensen.|`|kFaJxEhPaa	Ty Conklin without a doubt, the guy is playing like a starter, took Ozzy's job, and still gets criticism and still seen as a back-up guy by most people. He earned the right, to be the starter for Detroit, just too bad nobody is giving him his due. <br>  <br>  Also, his signing was under the radar, he's the reason why the Red Wings have the record that they do this year. Osgood hasn't been good at all this year, the defense has declined majorly, but Conklin has saved the team.  (Only if we still had him in Pittsburgh...)<br>  <br>  Also, that stud rookie that plays for Columbus is a stud (Mason)... he is going to be heard throughout the league here soon, just as soon as the team builds around him.

He has turned it around now but no he has got more than his credit due.

Increase distance and/or speed (combined) by 10% per week -- avoid race pace if possible as that could lead to injury.  By summer you should be in the 10K to 1/2 Marathon range.  When you are comfortable with the distance, start working on speed.<br>  <br>  By the end of the year you might say, forget the track team.  I have the Chicago marathon next week.|`|yiyvlbKLaa	go for a morning run before school for something.<br>  <br>  tip: start out slow and then gain speed at the end|`|nZovDDxXaa	Well if you're not racing for like a year the best thing to do would probably be a lot of base training which is just a lot of long slow mileage.  No real point in doing speed work as it won't help you that much in a year.  Maybe start off at 3 or 4 miles a day and work up until you can do like 7 or 8.<br>  But I would suggest do track no matter how bad you are because first off there are probably people that do track that our worse than you and second it's the best way to gain experience+learn what correct workouts are and it's always easier to train with others.|`|OdJXlPvkaa	Try to run as much as you can each day, track doesnt depend on fast or not just if you can run long or not, and while you run save some energy so when it almost come to finish line burst all of energy out and get a strong finish. hope this help

Audi,, What the hell is that in you pic??????|`|BPO6roTOaa	I used to play in Kindergarten lol!<br>  <br>  I remember playing keeper a little bit and I practically let the other team get a goal. I remember because I just backed up against the net and the guy just walked right in. I was embarrassed because I didn't know that all it had to do was cross the goal line. Haha. And then my parents wouldn't let me play anymore because I would get violent. Not like, break your neck violent, but I'd tell the other team they suck and then get all angry when we lost.<br>  <br>  Other than that, there was really no strategy, I mean, we were all like six years old. It was like a 3-game season (it was poorly sponsored and no one really likes the sport in America, especially in the south). The only other things I remember is that I just liked to be 'somewhat' of a striker, I remember hitting a couple off of the post, and I would always be the leader in assists since I was so close up next to my other friend who was one of the fastest kids I've ever met.|`|IhX8Hujuaa	Im a goalkeeper i beleive im prity good... i play sfootball(soccer)i play in the AWFA  every sunday i play and i have training on thursdays ! ! ! me and mi mates play soccer alot at scool,if u dont play for a local team then i suggest you start .you seem prity good|`|ShNT5Mjhaa	I play either Left Midfield, Centre Mid (Box-to-Box) or Striker.

CAM or winger.|`|JdlkhEayaa	I only wish I was still young enough to play the game.<br>  I'm only capable of watching the game now.<br>  I used to play in junior football leagues, business house league, Zingari league (that does show my age...oops!), and had trials for Wrexham and Burnley.<br>  Obviously, I couldn't have been good enough to play Professional but I still enjoyed every minute of every game I played in.<br>  Probably got booked and sent off more than I should have...nothing to be proud of.<br>  I always played in the fullback positions.<br>  Those were the days!!<br>  I hope you keep on playing and enjoying your football....what a game!|`|FFE9Qztzaa	I used to play football.. and am still looking forward to playing some more.<br>  I am confident in myself and say that, I do think i'm good, but i'm no "pro". lol.|`|XU1KaWXwaa	yh whnever i can at school rubbish though :( but good at toe punting lol|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Did. was alright and used to play sweeper had to quitt when the knees went|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I do play football.I usually play as the defensive midfielder or the striker,whichever suits my fancy.I'm trying to make the school team next semester.Fingers crossed,although the school team is made up of national U18 players :S<br>  <br>  I'd say I'm mediocre to average.Depends on my mood,sometimes I'm terrible,sometimes I'm on form.|`|m2zXOREJaa	Retired<br>   Played as a multi/role or as you may say a versatile positional player i'e was i good on the books of a Scottish 1st Division side,played for West of Scotland,came to Manchester in 1990 then in 95 got back into football in the Manchester Amateur Sunday league,played for County and had trials with Oldham,and was approached by unibond teams,better than Giggs but alas cigarettes and alcohol and a nice supplement of medicinal purposes put paid to that.<br>   So yes i am good!|`|D7Dubtt9aa	I dont play anymore I used too though I represented my county for a while and also played in a conference club reserves. I was offered a contract with a pro club but got injured. I played anywhere along the back and sometimes on the right wing.

xcQqwITWaa	Rafa has been given enough opportunity and the he won some title for the kop but i am sure that all liverpool fan including me want the kop to win the english preimership title more than champions league and now manutd are behind us only one title away and most players of liverpool are good but some position is rubbish and i believe that if mourinho come he would change everything and i believe he could make liverpool win the title. I respect rafa but it is too much liverpool didn't win the title for 18 years and he is going to extend more and i believe rafa should not sign the contract or he should just be sacked and i believe the special one will make liverpool great again like before|`|jiFHJ6daaa	if rafa leaves its ok..............but sacking wont be good enough..........he have gven lot tous|`|c4GykfVkaa	No, I wouldn't coz i'm a loyal person and besides he's doing quite well, but mourinho is hell of a manager!!!!! he's very cool, the best in the world maybe|`|qActFDroaa	Hell no.. What a dum question. Rafa is the man hugely respected by the Kop. It took god (Shankly) this long to win the title and i believe Rafa will achieve it next year. It took Sir Alex 7 years to win the title with Man U and look what he achieved. <br>  <br>  U can destroy a team in one year as a bad manager, just ask anyone managed by Graeme Souness, but it takes time to create the kind of Dynasty that Rafa is going to do at Liverpool and Fergie has done with United.<br>  <br>  Mourinho had instant success at Chelsea but to be fair he had an open cheaque book yhe likes no manager had ever seen before. Rafa has had to buy smart through the years with the only real failure being Robbie Keanne which was a shame because he is a fantastic player.<br>  <br>  Go Rafa Go the Reds<br>  (P.S) Hope Ronaldo breaks a leg crashing one of his many supercharged cars, then 7 points wont be to much to catch up.|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	Yes, I would.

88vcImqiaa	It's the best news I've heard today.  Woods is a TOTAL jerk.  I don't know how people can watch him slamming his club down after any shot that is not quite perfect enough, or screaming swear words when things don't go right.  Doesn't matter how good he is, he is a world-class jerk.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Many and most very good golfers have a temper tantrum here and there on the course.  It's just all of Tiger's get seem to get caught on TV because he is so popular and usually contending for the win.  And Tiger is hardly a jerk.  Look what this guy has done for charity over the years. But you're certainly entitled to that opinion.|`|pOlTrXQlaa	ah, in a word............................ NO!!<br>  Tiger is the best thing that ever happened golf.  sure, there are a handful or people (including me) that will watch golf no matter who is playing.  but the majority of people will watch golf simply because Tiger is playing.  as a fan of the sport, having Tiger do well is the best possible thing that could happen to the sport of golf.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	YES!  i wish his plane would crash, so i wouldnt have to the slurping sound coming from everyone being on his d***|`|ejjX7zgoaa	Can't we just leave Tiger alone?  It's bad enough that his shots are the only shots that the broadcasts replay... over and over....  And every time he goes up to swing the club at all they go Live to Tiger...  He's a golfer, a damn good one, but there are other good golfers there too.  I understand he just came back from 8 months away, but seriously.  But why do you give a **** if he was eliminated?

IoCK2bEnaa	Dude you are so retarded. Why do you think the redskins always throw out good players in the offseason? Because they overpay overrated football players. Dur. Rarely do free agents get to washington and do well. They go there for the money. And god knows you cant BUY a championship. Redskins are winning the superbowl, or even going to it this upcoming season. Get over it. Next...|`|zFNOaDAYaa	WOW! Thats a tough one cause they are BOTH overpaid. Haynesworth is getting 'QB' money and that shouldnt happen .Especially if he cant play a full season. and Hall hasn't proved anything the past 2 seasons. I JUST WON"T ANSWER THAT ONE|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	Washington wasted money on Hall.  Whereas you could make an arguement that Haynesworth should have been defensive MVP the last two seasons.  He commands double and triple teams in almost every game he plays.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	there both good haynesworth will provide pressure on the QB and force a bad pass and hall will be there to pick it off im not a skins fan but great job on making a smart move|`|0TAld46gaa	Hall got kicked out of Oakland<br>  because he couldnt play man to man coverage.<br>  <br>  So i am not sure what kind of defense Washington plays.<br>  I still feel they overpayed.<br>  <br>  But Hall is not a top 10 corner|`|mTSOJKlyaa	"hall is in the top 2-3 CB's?" lmfao good joke dude<br>  <br>  5 Cornerbacks better then hall(just to name a few):<br>  <br>  Cortland Finnegan<br>  Antoine Winfield<br>  Nnamdi Asomugha<br>  Josh Wilson<br>  Chris Gamble

IF YOU GET BORED WAITING FOR THE FISH YOU CAN ALSO ENTERTAIN YOURSELF WITH THE SOUND OF FLUSHING WATER - YOU DID WANT FRESH WATER RIGHT??|`|cow6ETlNaa	sorry i don't know that place
E4S6IpRKaa	I'm not a redskin fan but dumping 54 mil into a underacheiving corner like hall even upsets me. Hall has always been average even in Atlanta. Al Davis (the speed freak) dumped this guy. You never know though he could pan out to be pretty good but I doubt it he's not wort the long term contract. However I'm sure redskin fans don't care cause there still in shock of the beast they got in fat albert(great pick up he's unstoppable). A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down or a spoon full of haynesworth helps the hall deal go down|`|IoCK2bEnaa	Lol idiot. Rich franchises like the skins and cowboys abuse their money every year, thinking they can BUY a championship. The trick is to be frugal, and not always be focused on the marquee players. Deangelo and Albert are talented players yes, but they are ridiculously overpaid. You will find over the years, a lot of great players on your roster being cut in order for the redskins to stay under the cap. Albert Haynseworth is a cancer for your team. They will have lockerroom trouble sooner or later. The truly great teams build their franchise around the draft not FA. GO STEELERS!!!|`|vz2Bedmyaa	alright, someone signed these 2 bozo's. haynesworth is so overrated it's not even funny. hall is not even a top 25 corner, he is another pacman jones, a locker room problem. i guess snyder is the new jerry jones, paying a ton of money for crap. i guess next they'll sign to when he is released. thanks to the cowgirls and the deadskins, for taking these 2 players off the market.|`|SbdWqDCGaa	Hall gets burned 80% of the time and doesn't have the stats to back up that kind of money.  Haynesworth did crappy for 5 years then played tough when it came contract time.  Both are overpaid and I love to see the weak redskins throw money down the shitter.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	I'm guessing the Skins didn't see Hall (barely) play in Oakland last year.  $9MIL per year for a CB who got absolutely torched in virtually every game he played in last year seems like a waste of money to me.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Hall is a locker room problem; not to mention severely over-rated. Not even high on the Haynesworth signing, since it's the Redskins. Rarely does someone go to Washington and do well.|`|KNTofuxMaa	That doesn't necessarily mean he will get 54 million. There are a lot of clauses and stipulations in contracts that effectively diminish the probability of him securing the full amount of that contract. If he actually makes all 54 mil then, it will be because he played the length of the contract at a high level of play thus, "earning" the money. Don't think that the Redskins won't cut him if he proves to be a bust.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	He's shown improvement from his time at Oakland (but who doesn't? ).But I dont know if it is worth sighning him to that kind of contract. That is pretty significant. I dthink it was a VERY bad idea to do that|`|i0QzvbSnaa	Hall is almost as good as Asomugha, who Oakland just paid the Haynesworth money for and is only 25 years old, he is a much better buy than Albert.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	He didn't fit into Oakland's system. He can lead the NFL in INT's. We need a Corner so im all for it. WOW we have the best DT in the game now. YESS!!!|`|YiZ1s1Rraa	I am a skins fan and I think at most it should have been 5 years 25 million. Thats way too much money. You could get other decent players with the other 29 million.
5xIroQjMaa	It's called capitalism. You take the good with the bad. I for one have no problem with it, considering the owners rake in hundreds of millions of dollars every year, on the backs of players like Manny. There's nothing wrong with asking for your share of it.|`|nDzenpkwaa	I don't think so.  The USA was built on opportunity.  I know we get discouraged when we see people making millions for doing so little.  But the reality is, they are entertainers and they get paid the most out of anyone, anywhere!  Agents are there to assist the entertainers in getting their piece of the pie.  The NBA basically got rid of greedy agents by saying, "Hey, this is the most a player can make. Decide who the best player is on your team and pay him this much!"  There is no need for an agent anymore.  But then again you have endorsements and other ways of racking in the millions.  It is a hard, rough world and the only the mean, lying, SOB's come out on top.  It is the reason I play COD 5.  I pretend everyones face is Manny's and shoot'em up...|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Considering that Ramirez will, right now, be collecting zero pay for the 2009 season, you're doing an awful lot of complaining about (quite literally) nothing.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Come on now no one is holding a gun to Manny's head remember last winter when Arod opt out of his contract? he ended up resigning without Boras as his agent he did it on his own and didn't speak to Boras for 6 months.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	That's why the USA is the best country in the world!  <br>  Personally, I don't like communism.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	As much as I despise Scott Boras and his greedy motives, what could possibly be done? He's not doing anything outside of the boundaries.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	You can call it greedy and it is. But it's also the free market at work. The fact is that none of these sports team owners *must* pay these outrageous contracts. They choose to do so to ensure a competitive team. Hey, at least they're trying! Look at the Pittsburgh Pirates. They don't even attempt to field a winning team.<br>  <br>  Sports stars are entertainers just like singers and movie stars. They get the big money because they generate big money. Not everyone can put 100,000 butts in the seats at $100 a pop, and they're paid accordingly.
AbDAdrXkaa	The race today was just awesome and I think 2morrow's race is going to be entertaining to watch too :)<br>  Congrats to Kyle!!|`|XJv0wTsDaa	i hope so but the truck series has had some great racing for awhile now and im hooked on it as much as i am the other 2 series , also Kyle was pretty awesome today to lose 3rd gear and have to fall back and finally get up to speed then make the run he did to win was amazing , this kid has to be the most talented driver ive seen in a long time and at 23 hes gonna win alot of races and championships before hes done.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	Cup races are too long and boring until the last 10 or so miles. the truck guys show up to race!!!! <br>  <br>  The truck race is usually  the best race of the weekend. It will probably be the best race this week too.<br>  <br>  The shrub sure is one he!!uva racer! Never quits!<br>  <br>  Who else thinks Eldora should have a cup race!!!!|`|71c0e431058e396595b5a2772f5b2d6faa	It was a great race! I hope the Cup one is as entertaining that would be amazing!|`|qQq23yziaa	Maybe it was really good. The truck races are a blast. they are sorter and the action is non-stop. really enjoyed today|`|BD78ZzYkaa	Sure hope so, Congrats to Kyle, and tomorrow will be Kevin's turn.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	BETTER A LOT BETTER  and Busch wins !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|l4ZQchFkaa	Man I Like Rowdy a lot! Hes from my hometown, and the kids a badd a** driver but man how did he make that run from 8th with 6 to go and win it?!? Kudos to the team, no third gear? That truck was hookin up!<br>  <br>  Oh yeah the ??<br>  The cup finish might be as good.|`|TYc6nAUsaa	Not if Kyle Busch wins the cup race.<br>  The only reason the truck race would outshine the cup race is if Kyle won.<br>  All they talk about is kyle, kyle, kyle, wild thing, kyle busch, kyle busch, kyle, kyle, kyle...!|`|d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	Today's race was very exciting. Hopefully tomorrow it will be exactly the same, except for the last 2 laps. Those should turn out a little different, ending with the #29 in victory lane.|`|GCOrku95aa	As long as anybody other than Kyle Busch wins, I'll be happy. I like variety with my sports.<br>  <br>  If Mark Martin wins, I'll be ecstatic.|`|smDClNDkaa	maybe.<br>  Hotlanta has had some of the best finishes in Cup history.<br>  So the Cup race could be even closer.|`|Tu1R9YPzaa	I hope the Cup race is just as good. Congrats to Kyle Busch!!|`|iO12Vjnvaa	They usually do...so I am guessing the CUP race won't be as near as exciting. Just an opinion as always.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	It's not the same kind of racing..<br>  I've always liked truck racing..<br>  It's like an appetizer, at the beginning of the feast..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	The Cup race will be exciting, but the competition is going to be on a whole different level. I would like to see your comments in here, on Kyle Busch, after the race Sunday. I want to see real fan dediction. I will be here with my comments on Kyles performance. He's the driver to watch. I can already feel the excitement!|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	Man that was a crazy finish. I was about to give up on Kyle winning. I'm about to rewatch the finish to see how he got up there again.|`|u4liwDhAaa	I have learned in racing anything can happen at any time!  Tomorrow's Sprint race should be dynamite!|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	The trucks at Atlanta are aways great, that was a super race, I think Rowdy could have won with 1 gear, looks like he was fighting the wheel all day, but then he can drive the wheels and gears out and still win. I hope the Cup race is just as good but then its a longer race, and we will have the usual just hanging out till last 60 laps or so, and yep we'll have the same ole digger crap to watch, but this is Atlanta and its known for some wild races, could be some road kill on the track. (sorry folks i'm just not into that rodent) come on Goodyear your tires can get this rodent.. But I'm hoping for a great race tomorrow, and if its anything like today...I'm happy, maybe I can recover in my fantasy racing this week..By the way Congrats to Rowdy for a great win and finish today.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms

dDKS40Zsaa	You don't say what kind a dancing is required. <br>  What I mean is - tap, jitterbug, free-style, etc.<br>  It might be a good idea to enroll at you local dance studio for a couple months to get in shape and learn a few good moves.<br>  Better still, find a person who is already on the dance team and ask them for assistance.<br>  Good luck. See you on Broadway some day.
ptDkPkd8aa	That actually happened to me as well, although our coach was a maniac and made us run 20 miles each week it was our 'goal', including practice. I never ran that much either so I developed extreme soreness and a painful limp... An ice bath at least 2 times a week helped A LOT (but that's actually more painful than the soreness lol). Make sure to stretch a lot before running and sometimes after, for the limp I took some antiinflammatory like ibuprophen. Make sure to wear running shoes too, I realized wearing Nike shox's I used for sprints wasn't right for long distances.|`|yCM2v7FOaa	The reason why you're sore in the first place that you just started running. Your is trying to get used to the hard running. Just keep up the running. but, REMEMBER to stretch your legs longer after you run. If you keep it up, the soreness will go away. Also, the limp is just temporary. If it doesn't go away after a few weeks or get work you need to a trainer and a doctor.<br>  <br>  Experience: cross crountry: 10, 11 grade. Indoor: 11 Outdoor Track: 9, 10, 11|`|3WEMuGWTaa	Your body just isn't used to the pounding of running. It will take some time before your joints adapt to the shock absorption and your muscles will be sore until they become stronger.  Best advice I can give is just to stick with it. taking a day off every now and then isn't a bad idea either.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	continue to stretch well before AND after running, drink lotsa Gatorade, and eat bananas.  invest in good shoes & see your doctor to rule out a medical cause.|`|4LrOVUgnaa	icing helps, stretching before and after helps, but mostly youre going to just have to kinda run through it.. its like quitting smoking.  you gotta get over the hump which is about three weeks ish. also running an hour after practice is too much.. if youre in high school you dont need to do an hour extra on top of your already required hour... ice and stretch.

kQSSz2X2aa	Simple: there's a high demand. People are buying guns at an unprecedented rate because they are afraid that there will be new/higher taxes imposed and/or that some guns will be banned/further regulated.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	30 days Obama's been in office and no ban materialized. but somehow the majority of gun owners (or just a few very rich ones) still believe Obama and his cabinet of gun-banners will reinstate a permanent AW ban. or some kind of massive all gun ban. Like the UK gun laws. Available for everyone but the actual getting of guns is impossible (so they don't completely make the law unconstitutional). With the "assault weapons" type of guns gone, people are starting to buy everything else they can get their hands on also anticipating a hunting rifle ban, a shotgun ban, a handgun ban, and a ammo ban. <br>  <br>  and that would explain why none of my local walmarts has any ammo left beside CCI .22 rimfire ammo. And pallets of birdshot shells. In some places of the nation entire state there is not one store that has any 7.62x39mm in stock. The mass panic buying has also completely emptied all warehouses and storage, its all up to the manufacturers of guns and ammo and the importers to get that stuff back in stock.<br>  <br>  If anyone actually looks at what's happened the last couple months it is very doubtful obama will ban anything, there are probably more guns and ammo in people's homes then there has ever been in US history. any gun grab attempt would probably end in disaster. The number of AR, AK, and various military-styled rifles has probably tripled if supply of such weapons has collapsed in mid-December. Ammo has been going as fast as importers and factories can make them, America makes 11 billion rounds of ammo a year, so the last 3 months we're talking about 3 billion more rounds of ammo that people has bought. <br>  With that in mind, I think all the panic over Obama's gun bans is pretty stupid. if he didn't ban all guns his 1st day of being US president, he probably will keep his word on not touching American's right to bear arms.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	We're seeing a shortage in semi-auto handguns, centerfire rifles, such as AR-15's and AK-47s and ammo.<br>  <br>  This is because of the high probability that President Obama is going to do what he can to ban these firearms.  He proclaimed that he was in favor of the Second Amendment, but he has backed every anti-gun legislation while a Senator from Illinois.  <br>  <br>  These are some of the stances that he has taken:<br>  <br>      *  Opposed bill okaying illegal gun use in home invasions. (Aug 2008)<br>      * Ok for states & cities to determine local gun laws. (Apr 2008)<br>      * FactCheck: Yes, Obama endorsed Illinois handgun ban. (Apr 2008)<br>      * April 2008: "Bittergate" labeled Obama elitist. (Apr 2008)<br>      * Respect 2nd Amendment, but local gun bans ok. (Feb 2008)<br>      * Provide some common-sense enforcement on gun licensing. (Jan 2008)<br>      * 2000: cosponsored bill to limit purchases to 1 gun per month. (Oct 2007)<br>      * Concealed carry OK for retired police officers. (Aug 2007)<br>      * Stop unscrupulous gun dealers dumping guns in cities. (Jul 2007)<br>      * Keep guns out of inner cities--but also problem of morality. (Oct 2006)<br>      * Bush erred in failing to renew assault weapons ban. (Oct 2004)<br>      * Ban semi-automatics, and more possession restrictions. (Jul 1998)<br>      * Voted NO on prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers. (Jul 2005) <br>  <br>  When I comes to the Second Amendment, this guy is a piece of garbage.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* The Gun Racks are Full here in Pennsylvania.* Come and Get Em.* " Lots of Ammo Also.*.. I had a Senator tell me to my Face that within Ten (10*) Years No Citizens will have any Guns.* The Reason he said it has not happened sooner is that they were Afraid to do it now.*.. " The People are the Masters of Both Congress and the Courts, Not to Overthrow the Constitution, but to Overthrow the Men Who Would Pervert it.".. <> Abraham Lincoln.*..Try Living and Remaining Free in America without Your Guns and Your Ammo; I Dare You.*.." Live Free or Die."..|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I haven't seen any shortage of traditional shotguns, rifles and revolvers. Semi auto handguns are up a bit, hi-cap magazines are selling well. <br>  <br>  What really is selling are AKs, SKSs, ARs and other military looking rifles. Pistol grip shotguns and rifles, or those with folding/collapsing stocks are selling well, too. They will all be affected to one extent or another when a new ban is passed. After remarks from our new AG the other day, many feel a new ban may be only a few months away.|`|HJTs6qppaa	It's a combination of dealers not wanting to much inventory at the end of the year, and the fear that the new administration is going to make some crazy changes.|`|Up1MrXI3aa	Even though the constitution guaranties our right to keep and bear arms, the government has at many times tried to limit that right. They have banned clips of capacity of over 10 rounds. Obama has said he thinks letting the ban on assault weapons expire was a mistake made by George Bush and he wants to make it permanent. There are also talks about banning semi-automatic weapons. What it comes down to is there are some very anti-gun people in high offices. They will try to push their agenda. I don't see this taking place until 2010/2011 but this is my opinion and not based off facts. <br>  <br>  The question I have is what is the true agenda behind disarming America?|`|DvzNqLPOaa	Because everyone is so scared about what Obama is going to do! A lot of guns (bushmaster for example) are back ordered 6 months or more! It's hard to find ammo as well! HR 45 (creation of a national gun database & then it allows law enforcement to enter your home to ensure you have registered all your guns) looks like it will pass and Holder wants to reinstate the Clinton gun ban (and Obama wants to make it permanent!). There are a lot of problems in this country, but our right to self defense is my main concern. I am not telling anyone how many guns or how much ammo I have-it is no ones business but my own! The economy is in terrible shape, people are losing jobs, it's horrible....Obama wants Communism-and what is the first step? TAKING AWAY GUNS! When the population can not protect themselves against a tyrannical government (Russia, Germany, China, etc!) is when people start to 'disappear'! Learn from History!<br>  <br>  Stock up on what you can-before you can't get it anymore!

I AM a Cavs fan and Magic fan and Spurs fan for various reasons mostly because they don't give up and they aren't very cocky. The Lakers, on the other hand, well lets just say they sometimes do give up (like last night because they were winning so much like alley ooping every play) and they are very cocky. So them Lakers are NOT my favorite team but you have to give them a little respect because of their so called "skill"|`|AA11758036	Lot of Laker Haters out there. But the truth of the matter is This Laker Team is preforming at a much better level than last year when they lost to The Celtics.  It's funny nobody expected last year's team to even make the finals, but this year from day one the question was " Can The Lake rs beat Boston" ?

T.O. is an aging talent that stays in amazing shape but lets his mouth open before he analyzes a situation. Buffalo is a small market and he might not be harassed by the media as much as he was in Dallas or Philly.

Leoc8rlGaa	I agree completely. The ICC has finally come to the realisation that terror attacks do occur, and furthermore, they can occur anywhere in the world. No country can be deemed "safe". Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka have the biggest problems, but there have been terror attacks in England, South Africa has widespread crime, Zimbabwe is practically a no go area, the West Indies can be a dodgy place is some areas, especially after dark, and has lax security that can easily be breached, and Australia may be next on the shopping list of terror groups; they have already been targetted abroad. Perhaps New Zealand is safe: they don't appear to offend anyone. <br>  <br>  And who's abusing you? I'm not, even if I do wholeheartedly disagree with you at times.

It's a sticky situation for the ICC because they, after security checks agreed to hold the champions trophy in Pakistan only to be out voted by the test nations in a bid to stop the tournament from being held there. <br>  <br>  It's a tough situation for test nations everywhere, the ICC can't guaruntee safety but Pakistan did and that guaruntee wasn't lived up to. In response to the attacks they stated that the situation was out of their control, and personally that isn't a good enough excuse. Bottom line, the players really can't be guarunteed of their safety by anyone, they just have to assess the issues as they come and do as they see fit.

kDjDfk05aa	No. Its not smart for any team to pick up T.O. Hes toxic no matter where he goes. If it wasn't for his selfish attitude and his desire to post his own stats so that hes remembered after this is all over, then he'd be a real superstar.<br>  <br>  Reality is though, if Lee Evans continues to be excited and can handle being number 2, then the combination of Trents big arm and T.O. down the field all day might just work out.|`|XuJNx6Z8aa	YES!  I am a lifelong Bills fan and I am very excited for this deal!  The Bills needed another threat at receiver and now they should a have a pretty good offense.  If Trent Edwards plays like he did the first half of the season, and Lee Evans and Marshawn Lynch the Offense will be hard to stop!|`|NPZDdWqoaa	well it depends on their current receivers and QB <br>  if their stats are low or high that will determine if it was a good choice <br>  and if thats a position they need a good player in (i hate T.O. btw he is good but he can lick the saggiest part of my knutz)|`|QO5Y8gyLaa	Of coarse it was smart he is questionably the best wide receiver in the NFL it was only a 1 year deal so it does not matter if he is a trouble maker. i mean who wouldn't want a future hall of fame player there team.|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	Apparently they think it was a good pick up.

If he continues his negative ways, they've only wasted one year and $6.5 mil.<br>  <br>  GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!|`|E3wAsSjUaa	The Bills can't even control Lynch, let alone Owens. Anyways, I can't wait to see 81 vs. 81 twice a season.<br>  <br>  Didn't Owens want to join a contender?|`|CL7OTeiCaa	No. They are a young team, and if they want veteran leadership, they should sign someone who isn't a trouble maker.

Xrwvu5Uraa	i think we will get to see that answered in the final four this year, Since pitt knocked off a pretty solid UCONN team yesterday, they are set up for a number one seed in the tourney. UNC has the best point guard in the nation with Ty Lawson and Pitt has Lavance Fields also a top PG. I would love to watch Hansbrough/thompson and Blair/young attack each other for a rebound. Unfortionately i have to give UNC the advantage due to one of the best coaches (roy williams) and the best supporting cast maybe in the history in college basketball, Wayne ellington, Deon Thompson, Danny Greene, all future pros. and most importantly the soon to be star ED DAVIS coming of the bench.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Pitt has proven that they could beat any team out there, North Carolina included. With Sam Young, DeJuan Blair and Levance Fields they have three of the top players in the country. The Big East conference this year is the strongest conference in the nation. Pitt is ranked #1 in RPI ratings and has beaten U Conn twice when they were ranked #1. Hansbrough is a great player but he hasn't played against a man child like Blair. The Big East could have three #1 seeds in the NCCA tourney. Pitt, U Conn and Louisville.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	If you mean football, its debatable...If you're talking about basketball, try asking this in the BASKETBALL section...and no...They wouldn't beat UNC in basketball...assuming EVERYONE is healthy...|`|AOgK773Eaa	Pitt could take them for sure. 6 out of ten times|`|biCk7SKmaa	NOOOPE!<br>  <br>  heels baby :)<br>  <br>  we got tyler hansboro|`|2734495ebe0db7825a50002a0b17e3edaa	Duuuuuuude!

Our defense is not playing good. How the hell does a player like Danilinho get passed Magallon and Galindo like it was nothing? Then Magallon messes up big time on the second goal, he could have easily kicked that away but the ball went between his legs! That America guy who injured Magallon must have really f*cked him up if he is playing so bad. I'm sure Magallon will get back to his nivel but for now, he is just playing horrible. And our offense is doing much either just like against Caracas we didn't was that many opportunities. We are getting useless crosses and it is just getting pathetic. Hopefully we play A LOT better this Wednesday against Caracas. <br>  <br>  @ Any Americanistas: I wouldn't be talking a lot of sh*t because last time I checked you guys are doing worse! You guys haven't won a single game at home. And my prediction for both of your next 2 games is a loss. You guys visit Atlante and Cruz Azul, two very good teams, so if I were you I wouldn't talk sh*t until your team actually wins. You guys (haters) get you happiness from other teams losing. You can't get it from you own team! That's kinda sad if you ask me.<br>  <br>  Oh and ARRIBA LAS CHIVAS!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: @ Diablito g: I was talking about all the Americanistas that were talking sh*t a.k.a. Aguila 14|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	Its all really clear to me now. Everton Played Like Shyyt, Which is not really News. When Chivas beat Pachuca, Pachua could of start winning in the 1st half but who knows what happened. Chivas then looses 2-0 to sum Venezuelen team. Whos National Sport is Baseball. And now they loose to Jaguares.... WOW...  Their Luck Ran out just like it did with Carlos Ochoa.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	They played like sh!t. I don't know if this is a reason but I think having to deal with two tournaments is getting to them. They need to get their act together and start playing like they were.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Jim Cornette is one of my all-time favorite wrestling personalities.  I love hearing the man "shoot" and tell wrestling stories.<br>  <br>  I will definitely be buying that book.  The Midnight Express is one of wrestling's greatest tag teams and it will be great reading the true stories (as opposed to the kayfabe articles in wrestling magazines) about the various members.  Cornette is a very funny man; the book should be a great read.<br>  <br>  The Midnights were an important phase of Cornette's career (basically, they made him who he was), but Cornette did a lot more in wrestling than just manage that team.  Cornette needs to write an autobiography.  I would pre-order that just because it's Cornette writing his own life-story.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Boy did I hate him when he was with them!I probably will wait until our local library gets it.I am sure that we could read some interesting storys.|`|X9iZA9svaa	and thats the bottom line cuz stone cold sed so|`|BAurzDXtaa	I think that book will be an interesting take on one of the best tag teams of all time.

I can't wait to see what he has to say about both the Dennis Condrey-Bobby Eaton verstion of the Midnight Express and the Bobby Eaton-Stan Lane version of the Midnight Express, I have a whole lot of questions such as: 1) What was it light working with Cowboy Bill Watts and Jim Ross in Midsouth Wrestling? 2) What was it light working with Jim Crockett, Jr, Dusty Rhodes and James J Dillon as Bookers? 3) The battles with the Rock n' Roll Express, the Fantastics, the Road Warriors, America's Team, the Four Horsemen?

scW1feEWaa	well if they were to become a tag team it wouldnt be in a while cuz orton has a stable called legacy and i definitely wouldnt want it to happen unless dx reunited too then it will be another rivalry. DX is the funniest and one of the favorite tag teams ever. Evolution is the best stable ever! I mean Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista in a allience.

But they were all always good wrestlers it just now they are much better.|`|lxvWnjP8aa	please bring Rated RKO back they were so awesome together. i loved watching them together. just it was like 2 of the top heels that looked like they would never team up just did and at first i was like sweet Orton and Edge as a team and then when i seen how good they were as a pair i was like damn these guys need to be tag champs then they became tag champs. i love Orton and Edge they are my favorite wrestlers besides Chris Jericho. <br>  <br>  Rated RKO is better tag team but DX is hilarious and very entertaining but i would say Rated RKO all the way|`|EzazmdpZaa	It would be awsome to see them reunite.

cKl8ZSrSaa	They said it's NASCARs way of saving money. They just started doing it this season (2009).

It does cut costs for some of the smaller teams, making it easier for them to get sponsorship.<br>  As for 'endangering the pit crew', I'm pretty sure they know it's not the safest job in the world. They do it for the love of the sport (and probably the adrenaline rush).<br>  Bottom line, it keeps the trucks from following each other around the track in a straight line and mixes it up a little.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	It's a good idea to save money.  I'd rather this and a full field instead of 25 cars. Every little bit helps and besides it's not a big deal anyway.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	It goes right along with, smaller fuel cells, making for more stops,<br>  lengthening the race, and endangering pit crews more often, or <br>  tempting drivers to skip a tire stop, and take out some innocent <br>  bystanders when the overdue tire lets go..|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Nascar is trying to save the teams money, less pit crew guys to bring to the races, not as many guys over the pit wall.

The only thing stopping the NYJ is uncertainty at the QB spot, i believe we have at least 1 good QB on our hands in either Kellen Clemens the 2nd round draft pick out of Oregon, or Brett Ratliff the undrafted QB out of Utah. but what we do have is one of the best RBs in the league currently in Thomas Jones and one ofthe best O-lines in the NFL, once we draft a WR i think the NYJ can make a run for the superbowl|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	everyone is just going to pick their favorite team and write pros about them and not any cons, for you since you hoped onto the broncos bandwagon this offseason think they will win the superbowl.<br>  I honestly dont think they will even make the playoffs for a few more years.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	A healthy Tom Brady makes the Patriots very dangerous.<br>  <br>  Think they have to be the favorite.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	the falcons<br>  there schedule is difficult<br>  and i predict they will go 12-4<br>  so if they can beat all of afc east and most of nfc east they can go to the superbowl<br>  FALCONS - NFC SOUTH 2009 CHAMPS|`|fb274e1c130e4d0a026f6a12b3411894aa	GO BRONCOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol yeah right not with mc daniels

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Hadn't thought of it that way before...<br>  <br>  The Japanese, for the most part, are hard-working, single-minded people.  Which might explain the Puro style of wrestling; "stiff", not a whole of frills to it, mostly technique.  The Japanese also have a rather eclectic taste in "entertainment", which might explain their fascination with American "giants" who portray over-the-top "monsters", such as Bruiser Brody and Vader, and "crazy" maniacs such as Terry Funk and Mick Foley.<br>  <br>  Mexicans are generally out-going and friendly people who love big social gatherings and that is reflected in the Luchador style with it's high-flying, fast-paced, fifty things happening at the same time, to get everybody involved, concept.<br>  <br>  And in America, anything goes, in society and in our entertainment, the larger the spectacle the more we love it.  We love the "drama" and we love the "bad boys" of the entertainment world, including wrestling.  The "meat and potatoes" of a given form of entertainment is generally boring to Americans; we love the ridiculous, the over the top, that which goes against the norm and pushes the envelop.<br>  <br>  But I don't think wrestling influences the cultures of the people.  I think wrestling reflects the culture of the people of that area.  Wrestling, despite it's worldwide appeal, still has a small, rather niche, fan base.  Most fans, worldwide, are "casual" fans and don't consider wrestling anything more than a TV show.  The really "hardcore" fans who live and breathe wrestling, are comparatively few; there aren't enough of them to influence the masses around them.|`|H3nbC71eaa	This works the other way around. The wrestling companies go by how their surroundings go. For example in the Attitude Era, that came about because having an Attitude is the way society was at that time. I can't speak for the other countries, but I do know that in Japan they take the sport aspect of wrestling more serious and thus the wrestling is very sport based and not storyline and character based.<br>  <br>  Wrestling just follows along as to what is going on in a particular culture at that time.|`|OYAoGpAraa	You have to remember that WWE cators to the fans who want some light hearted entertainment.<br>  <br>  America offers pure wrestling too, and guess what, it's less popular.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	ya, In the U.S. we are hard-headed and do what ever we want regardless of what people want us to do. Others try to do it there way, many times there ideas are better, but we are more popular. It is very similar in wrestling.|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	Yes, but only in a stereotypical sense. For example, lucha libre or "free fighting" could involve free spirited people and exciting people. Not to say everybody in mexico is that way, and same with Japan but that's why I added the fact that this could all be relevant in a stereotypical way. America is the place where most of our media isn't based on culture and values, but instead what markets the most. Hence, WWE and TNA's product. But there is some fact to it, as Bottomline pointed out about how Japan views wrestling, and the way I described how America ("the big two" promotion) views it.|`|NZKramllaa	Yes, IMO, Those Countries you Mention all have their own Aspects of "Traditional Wrestling". Whether its Mexico having Luchador style of Wrestling or Japan having a Stiff Style Type of Wrestling etc....., They all Wrestle basied of there "Tradition", but to keep it alive they may "alter" it and "modify" it a little, To go along With the Attitude of the current Generation and Economy.

AA10195988	The Sig Mosquito is a great plinking gun.  We bought one for our 16yr old daughter who is small and petite and she loves it.  We did have a problem with it jamming when we first got it, but called Sig and they fixed at no cost to us.  We have not had a jamming problem since.  I do recommend only firing the CCI mini mag or comparable ammo as anything else does tend to not eject.  <br>  <br>  As for using it for self defense, well a few well placed 22 shots beats a 45 that doesn't hit the target any day.  I would recommend a 9mm for home defense being as you are a woman and there are some good subcompact ones out there such as the Baby Eagle, the H&K and even the S&W M&P subcompacts.  Best thing to do is go to a reputable gun store and ask to see some.  Fondle them to see which is best in your hand and no matter what the clerk says, buy what you feel most comfortable with.|`|k85LaREAaa	Not especially, although most guns work by scaring off the intruder. If you want something that keeps the bad guys from moving, you'll need at least a 9mm, preferably a .45. Glock is a great brand and have light-weight weapons that are very reliable. Consider the Glock 21/22 or the Glock 26.|`|8oY6C3yBaa	Well, I love the SIG Mosquito. Its a great plinking gun. 22's are not that good for home protection. The have almost no stopping power. I suggest that you get a 9 mm. They are excellent home defense guns. Ruger P98 is a great gun for plinking and home defense.
SqgXLLnwaa	The most important part in pitching is balace and squaring your shoulders. Do /not/ try to aim the ball, just let it go. If you pitch from the wind up, take a small first step. Another big part part of pitching is following thru. As the guy above me said, "step a far as you can" this is a bad idea. Stepping too far can cause loss of balance. Step far enough to follow through correctly. After throwing your back should bend completely, and your elbow should come close to touching your opposite knee. Avoid throwing side arm, throw overhand for the best accuracy. Placement and changing speeds is the key to being succesful, don't throw as hard as you can, it will tire you out and speed isn't even key. Here's just a few tips, hope it helps.|`|6BiiraLpaa	Well pitching is a very tough thing to learn so don't be angry if you don't get the hang of it in the first couple of days. What you want to start off with is getting used to throwing a ball from 60 1/2 feet away so go to a baseball field and practice throwing to someone behind the plate.  What you can do on your own if you don't have anyone to play catch with is go to the baseball field with a bucket of balls and set up a barrier to stop the balls and hit right in the middle of the barrier, also since you are going to want to make it hard for the batter to hit try throwing the ball into the corners of the barrier. BUT remember do not aim with your glove just imagine it hitting the catcher in that place. You also are going to want to work on your balance, so what i would do is lift one leg up like you are going to pitch and have 1 arm forward and 1 arm back and hold that for about 20-30 seconds. If you need any other tips or drills go to youtube and watch videos on "How to improve your pitching" I hope this helped you become a better pitcher =)|`|oblnqjenaa	When you wind up, make sure your arm is stretched out fully behind you. when you come forward and step with your foot, step out as far as you can and make sure your stepping right toward home plate. Grip the ball on the two seams just because you don't have time to learn any pitches. Don't try to place the ball, just throw it down the middle because chances are if you have never pitched, the ball doesn't always go where you want it to so throw right down the middle.<br>  <br>  TeamUSA4Life

So I would be okay with HBK ending the "streak".|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Yes.<br>  Undertaker's streak is his legacy to the fans. It is the only thing that has made him and kept him huge throughout all the years. Yes, he is a great wrestler and performer but his huge lack of title reigns made Wrestlemania everything for his career. He has been said to be a voice for younger talent and just an overall positive backstage influence but only the men in that locker room will remember that, not the fans.  Shawn Michaels has nothing to gain from this win. He would be getting one huge win but it would be followed by a retirement in just a few years. Breaking the Streak isn't what he is going to be remembered for but retaining the Streak is what Undertaker will be.|`|efd05cdfa460b1b80a9744ee53a94758aa	If he ''ended'' Ric Flair's career, then he could be able to ''end'' Undertaker's undefeated streak.

r3PgrJhDaa	if your just starting to play, walmart has some very nice rackets that are like you said $20-$40. I think those worked great for me, but I never really got that good or was really into the sport, lol. However, if you do well and love it, then you can go ahead and buy a better one later.|`|iON9OINvaa	probably not, but it depends on how determined you are to play.  if you want to be a decent player and such, splurge on a racket, but don't go overboard.  if it'll just be a once a month kind of thing the price probably won't be worth it.  a good racket will be around $80 if your lucky enough to find one on sale.  a $30 racket won't be good.  it'll probably be too heavy and won't fit your hand.  just make sure that when you get one the grip is the right size.  let me know if you need more help!|`|AA12225295	If you are starting to play then I advise you to start somewhere with a decent racket. They usually cost $50-70 for a decent racket.

gBMSx1Jgaa	if you are that good with your volleys, then move up anytime...<br>  <br>  if your volleys are not that good, then only when your opponents are not able to hit an offensive shot.. (assuming that 1 of you is already at the net...)<br>  <br>  it really depends on your volley skills and your opponents shots...|`|eFy4RjhAaa	ok well it depends what position you are in. If your partner is Returning and you are right behind the service line, you want to move up to the net as soon as the Return goes past your Opponent at the net.

XnhJZQvfaa	It probably has nothing to do with your foot and everything to do with the fact that you are a leaper not a jumper. A leaper is someone who jumps better off one foot (left foot if you are right handed, right foot if you are left handed) as opposed to the power jumper who jumps better off two feet. This is caused by biomechanical factors, muscle fiber density differences and mostly by a difference in how the body creates power. Leapers naturally have more reactive power, while jumpers have more base strength. If you work on your base strength, core strength, eliminate weak links and energy leaks, optimize kinetic linking and biomechanics you'll jump better off two feet. <br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|SqgXLLnwaa	You need to get comfortable with that broken foot.

Many teams are not willing to take that risk but I look for someone to pick him up once he is healthy again.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	Have you heard? He's having surgery and he's a Type-A free agent which means someone will have to give up a draft pick to the Brewers to sign him. He's way too injury prone to give up a draft pick. He'll be signed by June.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	He is only one of the best pitchers when he is NOT injured, which is very rare, not to mention he is having shoulder surgery and the Brewers had to pick up the tab- he doesn't even play with the team any more!

This may work out better for him in the long run becuase he will likely end up with a contender.|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	Ben Sheets is signed to a contract.

The real question is what are the odds of you doing so, and whether or not you want it badly enough to make it a risk worth taking.<br>  <br>  Here's the hard truth -- for one reason or another, most young people your age who have an interest in playing professional sports do not make it.  If tens of thousands play football in high school, only thousands play in college, only hundreds get drafted in the NFL, and only dozens make the starting lineup.<br>  <br>  I don't say this to discourage you, but to give you a realistic picture.  Some players simply lack the ability.  Others lack the will and desire to work and keep going when times get tough.  Others are just unlucky; they suffer an unfortunate injury or play behind someone else, and never get the chance to realize their full potential.<br>  <br>  Based on my experience, I can verify that the majority of times players don't make it has nothing to do with their ability.  That may surprise you, but most of the time, it comes down to desire.  There are numerous athletes out there who are extremely talented, but are also lazy, undisciplined, or poor team players, and they eventually give up.  The players that make it are those who are hungriest.  They want it the most, and somehow find a way to get there, regardless of the odds or the competition.<br>  <br>  So what determines whether or not you make the NFL will not depend on what college you attend, how fast you run the 40, or how much you can lift in the weightroom.  It largely depends on what happens between your ears.  Only you can control or change that.   <br>  <br>  Will you, or won't you do what it takes?  That's up to you.  And that's the best advice I can give you.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Nope............................|`|CL7OTeiCaa	Yeah.

6JasMCbcaa	i have been playing in goal for 14 years now and have wore lots of different color strips in that time and i can honestly say that the colour dosent make a difference. the idea that the brightly coloured strips is that people have a theory that the strips will catch the eye off the striker and distract them giving the keeper an apparently higher chance of saving the ball or making the striker miss. it is all myth really. a the color of a keepers strip does not make them any more or anyless talented.<br>  <br>  on the gloves front it dosent matter what color just remember to have a pair that are confortable and have good grip as that is whats important. my personal favorate gloves ever where the nike tiempo gloves i had a few year back. where comfortable and the grip was immense.|`|YbOGOnroaa	I don't think the jersey colour matters so much although many South American goalies have jerseys of all the colours of the rainbow as well as all the colours put into one.<br>  <br>  Gloves on the hand. I have been wearing nike tiempo gloves for 3 years and they are reliable as hell! Make sure you buy a new one when they wear out as they tend to lose grip after that. BTW, I like wearing black gloves!|`|L1QTSErIaa	Some people claim Chelsea's Goalkeeper jersey, which is of bright neon orange, makes a keeper look bigger and more intmidating to the opponents.

As long as they are fit and comfortable. Try white pairs. Most professional keepers use white coloured gloves.|`|sKSeNAonaa	I am a goalie and I have a yellow goalkeeping jersey. Sometimes I have to change jerseys because the referees are yellow and it can be confusing. I have a backup gray one just in case that happens. The referees are supposed to change colors though. Anything bright or neon for jerseys would look pretty intimidating. Most gloves are an off-white color with maybe some black on them. Color does not matter with gloves. The most important thing is that you have a good grip on the ball and that they are only slightly bigger than your hand. If you do have a choice between color, I would recommend choosing something that matches your jersey or your teams jersey.

Ec2uIBjxaa	Middle splits!<br>  <br>  begin by sitting in a straddle stretch on a mat or like somethin soft, When stretching the middle splits during warm-up, go slowly. Even if you are very<br>  flexible, your muscles need time to adjust.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Lean towards each leg and towards the middle, just as you would for a plain "V" sit. Gradually work your legs wider, stretching your torso to each leg as you increase the straddle<br>  .<br>  Step3<br>  Roll your hips forward when your legs are fully split, moving your body into vertical alignment. The correct position is with toes pointed and your knees forward. The inside of your feet should lie flat on the mat. This is also the position you will use on the beam, allowing your toes to grab the edge.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Straighten your back. Although some arch is necessary due to your hip alignment, an over-arched back will receive a penalty in gymnastic competition. Lift your torso tall and tuck in your stomach.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Allow a gymnastic teammate to lift one of your legs carefully when you're in a full middle split. This helps you stretch into an over-split, which is necessary when performing your splits during a jump.<br>  <br>  Tips:::::::xx<br>  <br>  * Try stretching more often but not applying so much pressure that you're sore the next day. Instead of stretching once a day and forcing the split, stretch 3 times a day and use less pressure. Allow your muscles to warm up each time by proceeding slowly.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Relax into your splits. When doing the splits is uncomfortable, just sit there and breathe deeply for a few minutes. Your muscles will eventually relax, allowing your legs to stretch further.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Don't just drop down into the middle splits without a warm-up first. You could pull a muscle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Left and Right splits:<br>  Spend 10-15 minutes every morning before school doing all your streches<br>  Spend 10-15 minutes every night doing all your stretches<br>  Point your toes at all times it helps!<br>  Maybe even get some one to slightly push you down..i mean really carefully ,you don't want any broken bones here<br>  <br>  <br>  If you dont know what streches to do heres a link that will help you<br>  <a href="http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingraci..." rel="nofollow">http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingraci...</a> <br>  this is a really good stretchh as well <a href="http://z.about.com/d/running/1/5/G/-/-/-/hammycropped.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/running/1/5/G/-/-/-...</a><br>  make sure you practice every day and night it really makes a difference dont say ohh nahh i couldnt be botherd today im so tired ill practice tomorrow<br>  practice all the time okay,beleive in yourself dont think negative<br>  <br>  -you can even search on youtube for some extra tipes<br>  <br>  You can also stretch after you have had a warm bath/shower<br>  Make sure you dont start stretching straight away you have to warm up first maybe 5 minutes jumping with a jump rope<br>  or 5 minutes running around in the back/front yard<br>  I'm a gymnast i know what i'm talking about<br>  if you really try your hardest and push further and further each time you will be able to do all 3 splits in approx 2 weeks or even less,<br>  <br>  <br>  think positive YOU CAN DO IT<br>  good luck hope i helped|`|AbkJZchdaa	Im a cheer squad and you dont have to do the splits but they are helpful for toetouches.<br>  <br>  What I do is in this video. Just do what it says and the splits will come very easy.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnW03OuYODE&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnW03OuYO...</a><br>  <br>  For middle splits, get against a wall and lay on your back with your butt to the wall. Then open your legs forming a V. Stay like that for about 5 minutes then keep on moving your legs there, then moving them down. Pretty soon your legs will be in the splits.|`|a1fAaig3aa	sit on the ground and open your legs to a V position and stretch your arms up and lean forward, try to put your nose on the ground for middle splits. also if you know yoga, the tree position will help loosen your muscles, stand up straight and put your left leg on your right thigh and try to  balance and switch legs. Also, if you are familiar with cheerleading cupids with help. Stand up straight and grab your foot (either right or left) with your hand and stretch your leg up to your head trying to get your inner leg as close to your head as possible. Also, herculies stretches will help. Sit down bend your one leg behdin you like next to you in a bent position and touch your head to straight leg knee cap. Also if you stand up and slowly slide your legs out to the sides like you were going down to do the middle split and keep going down as far as you can with your but not up in the air and put your arms in front of you like you are reaching out to grab something and push yourself down. Do this slowly, you will be able to go farther each time. For middle splits you just have to keep trying, if you start where your groin is still far off the ground you can repeat each day and eventually you will be able to go all the way in a straddle position.<br>  <br>  And I was on a dance team in high school and both middle and front splits were required.|`|8ee4GOb9aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7NOmTAZtGU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7NOmTAZt...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I'm on cheer but no splits were required just a cheer :]<br>  <br>  hope this helped

Pujols, will likely be the most valuable fantasy player in the game, but first base is a stacked position too.  Go with Jose Reyes, or David Wright.  SS and 3B are shallow, and those two will be the best available players at their positions when it is your turn to pick.  first base and OF are easy postions to fill later in the draft.  Find the stronger players at the shallow positions why'll everyone else is chasing big names, like manny, getting a top quality catcher early will prove to be valuable too, because there are only a hand full of catchers who will give you quality production.  2B is also shallow.  if you get top quality players at 2B. SS, 3B, and C should be your goal, because there is a huge drop off between the top tier players at those positions and the second tier players.|`|en9WLpo5aa	I would take Hanley, top SS & he provides many categories, Pujols is a great option but theres tons of 1B you can draft later on who can get you power numbers (dont get me wrong though Pujols is ridiculous)|`|IRruNruhaa	Hanley, pujols is to over rated he is great but there are alot of good first basemen you can pick later like texeria|`|9fe84f36f98810f1f9585b773366babdaa	r u all joking? manny with the 2nd pick? u can get him in the 2nd/3rd round. i would take arod 2nd b/c of the lack of quality 3rd basemen

I have never been so torn in all my football life. I respect T.O. about as much as A-Roid so it's tough to actually acknowledge that this could be a good thing. However, it is only a one-year deal and Owens is the big target we have been needing to complement Evans. The big upside in this is that T.O. now has a chip on his shoulder and will want to prove himself once more. Plus he has alot of talent and ability. My overall take is this: my Bills haven't been to the playoffs in a decade. If this helps us get there, so be it. If he doesn't play up to par or causes trouble, oh well, it's just a 1 year deal or he could leave earlier. Maybe a different setting and a new committment will be enough. I sure hope so.|`|GxGsJixoaa	idk yet. i think it's about time the bills get a big name on the team, but i think the bills will be under the radar like last year. if you look at the bills in the last 3 years, each year they were in the playoff hunt into the later part of the season. they lost over half of their games by a touchdown or less, so hopefully TO will be able to score that one touchdown a game that will help us win those games.|`|g5RS83paaa	I'm a cowboys fan and I'm sad to see him go, I think he got a bad rap, but he really did try to help the cowboys|`|l0iCqzlQaa	yeah you guys are used to 4th place, so it wont be any different

XhexwM1faa	I'm pretty sure Michigan also has a higher RPI rating (33 for Michigan, 41 for Minnesota, or something like that), and not only that, but Michigan has much more wins against quality competition. Minnesota has beaten louisville, and that's it, whereas Michigan has beaten UCLA, Duke, Purdue, Illinois, and Penn State (plus the two wins over the Golden Gophers). Michigan has a better tournament resume then Minnesota. However, I think both teams will be in the Big Dance, so a week from now, any argument about who's more worthy between the Golden Gophers and Wolverines will be moot.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Michigan will get the higher seed since they swept the season series assuming its a 2-way tie. It gets complicated if there's a 3-way tie.|`|yt05KPhBaa	The quality of wins and then head to head wins|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	Head to head is the tie-breaker and since Michigan won both match ups, they get the higher seed.
br1kwegaaa	The game won't get blacked out completely from the NY area.<br>  <br>  For example, let's say that the Giants are the "home" team and the Jets are the "road" team in this example.  If the game doesn't sell out, the NFL is obliged to show the game whenever the road team is playing.  This means that the game will be locally broadcast live on CBS (where the AFC broadcast will be aired) but it will not be broadcast on FOX (where the NFC broadcast would be aired) in the greater NY area.<br>  <br>  Note: I live in the Bay Area and we have this dilemna whenever the Niners and Raiders play in the preseason.  What I described to you is what happens in the Bay Area, especially when the preseason game is being played in Oakland.  In this situation, the SF broadcast is shown live and the Raider broadcast of the game is on tape delay.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	both teams have season ticket reservations waiting to buy tickets miles long....  but if it did happen I am sure fox would just impose images of fans|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Whoever the home team is their market would be blacked out and not shown on tv.

v5MP0KJ8aa	Don't get past her, over power her. Back her down to the basket and shoot over her.|`|NEtVRjplaa	You can't guard her, she'll win every time :D. [speaking from personal experience]<br>  <br>  Just playing.. The best thing you can do is keep up with her. You need to match her speed and stop her from driving in. Pesky defense is important. Get in her face and make her shoot outside shots, she has less chance of making them.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	if u have to guard her make sure u have a good defensive stance and give her space so if she makes a move u can still stay in front of her|`|Dug6yDOLaa	stay down really low and slide. watch her stomach because she can't go to any side without it. just keep down and slide quickly, watching her stomach, and you will have no problem guarding her.|`|yt05KPhBaa	Kick her in the nuts.<br>  <br>  JK. Just do some speed training. Try running and changing directions on the dime to up your quickness. And use your length on her.|`|tpn7iR48aa	first you stick out your foot, trip her, kick her in the knee really hard, then run for the basket|`|iGS5rXuHaa	Give her some space. If you know she can drive on you or change directions quicker then you can, just stay a little further back than you normally would on a girl defending you.

DnFoaKPqaa	I would try being a safety actually. If you can become a great safety at a young age, you have a better chance of playing for a college team one day!|`|M5ykrN4Laa	Ummm, like how fast, really fast doesnt work|`|ghuylY92aa	Why not be a QB, that where the money is, and if you start now you will be really good by college, you could go #1 in the draft, play for your favorite team and make $100,000,000.00 in the process.|`|xgqevAgIaa	What an awful selection of positions. That pretty much covers the whole team. With your description, WR.|`|HFGjaRYjaa	WR maybe idk|`|xfJuyHoeaa	QB. well it depends if your tall and have a good arm QB could be for you. But being taller would be an advantage so you can see over your offensive line.<br>  <br>  WR. You don't have to be the tallest guy out there but it will help you. Also you need to be very tough you will get laid out many times by the safety's.<br>  <br>  RB. You could be a descent running back if you have good vision this means if your O-line makes a gap can you find it fast and accelerate through it for a gain. You don't need to be to big for RB but you don't wanna be too small because RB's get the most punishment they constantly get hit every play and being small could get you injured at this position .<br>  <br>  FS. OK at safety there are 2 positions 1 is a strong safety and one is a Free safety I will cover the Free safety here. A FS job is to read where the ball is going to be thrown and try to be there to help defend it.<br>  <br>  SS. And a Strong safety's job is to line up on the Strong side of the line (Usually the side the Tight end lines up on) And play man coverage on the TE. But on run plays he will move up into the box and help take down the Runner. SS are usually bigger and can tackle good.<br>  <br>  CB. They can play man coverage which means they stick with the WR and if the ball gets thrown to the WR your covering your job is to bat it down or try to pick it off. OR if the play calls for zone coverage this is where you simply cover the selcted area the play calls for. And sometimes CB's are called to do a CB blitz where they rush the CB from the corner.<br>  ===========================<br>  <br>  If I was you I would just stay in shape workout and run a lot and when tryouts come around do what the coaches say and as long as your in shape and don't slack off you should get a starting spot at the position they think is best for you. And don't be to nervous just do it I'm assuming you will be playing im 8th grade and in middle school football isn't to competitive so now would be a great opportunity too see if you like it.

Good Luck|`|SqgXLLnwaa	I've never understood why people ask these types of questions.<br>  Why let people sitting miles away determine your future for you from their computer screen?<br>  Play what you want to play, play what you think you'll have the best success at.

Your coaches would probably make a better guess. Ask a coach what he thinks.<br>  <br>  Once you get to ninth grade, you'll have a better idea of what size and height your gonna be. Until then, it's kind of a waiting game.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, if you like defense, LB is some good experience, and so are DB and CB. If you think you will be a bigger guy, I'd go with LB. Smaller and faster, the other two.<br>  <br>  If offense suits you better, you might want to get some reps in at TE. You'll get to practice a lot of running and passing plays there.<br>  <br>  Like I said, once you get to high school, you'll be in a better position to decide. Your coaches there, if they're any good, will be able to put you where you'll best be able to perform well and help the team.<br>  <br>  Just remember:<br>  <br>  The only thing that matters is making the play.<br>  Learn your position inside and out.<br>  It's all about how bad you want it, and how much work you put in to get it.<br>  <br>  There is no substitute for heart, work, or dedication to excellence.<br>  <br>  We have a saying here at our school:<br>  <br>  BEING A CHAMPION DOES NOT HAPPEN BY CHANCE,<br>  IT IS A CHOICE.<br>  <br>  Good luck, kid...<br>  ____________________<br>  <br>  ADDED: I almost forgot, spring football leagues in 7th and 8th grade will help a lot, and give you really good extra practice and playing time.

OYAoGpAraa	Find 70 year olds who couldn't cut the mustard in the WWE<br>  <br>  oh wait, TNA beat you to that|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	step 1Begin by purchasing a ring. Wrestling rings are portable and can be brought from town to town. Buying your own ring is a solid investment for anybody hoping to start a wrestling federation. In the end, you'll actually save money since you won't have to rent a wrestling ring every weekend (see Resources below).<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Obtain a promoter's license. Many people are unaware that you can actually be fined for not having the proper license to promote a wrestling event. As with driving or other things of this nature, there are different ways to obtain such a license in each state. Investigate how the process is done in your state before continuing.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Create a name for your wrestling federation. Most wrestling federations are made up of three words (WWE, ECW, WCW, TNA, etc.). Many smaller wrestling federations have the town, city or state in the name (NJPW is "New Jersey Pro Wrestling"). Make sure that there is no wrestling federation which already has your selected name before you go on.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Decide what type of wrestling federation you wish to have. You could, for example, attempt to have the same type of wresting found in WWE. Perhaps you'd like your federation to have more of an ROH or old ECW feel to it. This will be determined by your likes and dislikes as well as the wrestlers you wish to have in your promotion.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Contact other local independent wrestling promotions and inform them about your intentions. You don't, after all, want to be stepping on the toes of local promoters who have been around longer than you. If you get on their good side, they may be able to help you with talent exchanges and promotion of your wrestling federation. They'll also be able to help you with acquiring talent for your new wrestling federation.<br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Start off with a roster of local, independent wrestlers who are allowed to wrestle in other wrestling federations. Every successful wrestling federation starts off as a local sensation. For this to work, you'll need wrestlers who are popular in your area. Contact these wrestlers about performing for your wrestling federation. You should start off with a relatively small roster. Anymore than 20 wrestlers to start is probably too much for an upstart wrestling federation.<br>  Step7<br>  <br>  Call different places about holding wrestling events. Most small wrestling federations have shows in school gyms and other such places. Call these places both in your town and city as well as surrounding areas and make sure that they're open to you renting out the area for a wrestling event. You should have anywhere between 5 to 7 places that you can house a wrestling event.<br>  Step8<br>  <br>  Create a website for your wrestling federation. Wrestling fans love to use the Internet to find the latest story lines, spoilers and updates. Use the Internet as a way to promote your new wrestling federation and inform potential fans about upcoming shows. Go into local wrestling forums and inform users about your new wrestling promotion.<br>  Step9<br>  <br>  Don't worry about titles or story lines at first. Instead, simply have your wrestlers compete against one another so that the fans can get used to seeing them. Making somebody a champ the first time out won't mean much, especially to a fan who's never seen that wrestler before. Letting your wrestlers perform in the ring can also make the story writing much easier for you. Many times, wrestlers can create a feud or rivalry themselves with their work in the ring.|`|UbUSth5haa	Its alot of work and aside from getting a buisness license you have to get talent to wrestle for little or no mone, find a venue, and other things like that, its alot of work, and if you get your company up and going then you'll be all set!<br>  Good luck!!|`|qqLcvDDKaa	Your going to need Alot of money to make it work.

AA10744471	O Willy, dear Willy! How true your statements, and how true how time passes. Really, yes, I wish I was also 10 watching with my two big brothers how the Macho Man demolished the Hulk but in the end Hogan does a high kick and the Savage Randy o okay Randy Savage was counted out (it was a very long count and the crowd was complaining! mind you!) while the beautiful, o how beautiful, Elizabeth looked with chagrin (good acting, really!). Do you remember how the dubious Ted D'Biase cheated to the delight or frustration of the maddening crowd? Tempus fugit... Well, we have grown up Willy and we have become wise to the ways of the world, and that is why wrestling really sucks nowadays. Or was it because we have become jaded and our perceptions have become warped? I don't know, but I agree with you that nowadays wrestling sucks. Good luck to you and God bless.

5LXAhJktaa	So they're not running after balls forever.  Why do you have a backstop when you play baseball?  So you don't have to chase after the ball after throwing one and the dirt and end up searching for it in the bushes.<br>  <br>  Same concept.|`|WU9q4wNXaa	What the other guy said|`|AA11939747	And how about  little protection for those fans sitting behind home plate.

xfJuyHoeaa	If I was you I would pick your home town team that is what makes a football fan someone who Roots for they're team even if they go 0-16 and is they're when they're team wins the super bowl. <br>  <br>  But if you just like the fancy stuff in football then I would say You should like the Philadelphia Eagles<br>  <br>  Since they have Donovan Mcnabb one of the best QB's that can escape a defensive lineman and either throw it down field or burn them by running it.<br>  <br>  And they're running game is always a bomb waiting to go off and bye that I mean Brian Westbrook slipping through the defense and getting a easy TD.<br>  <br>  As for interceptions there best CB is Asante Samuel and I don't know much about there Defensive back's but I have seen many highlights of them running back interceptions for touchdowns otherwise known as a Pick-Six. <br>  <br>  Check out all the links I provide in the source section. <br>  Good luck picking a team hope I helped.|`|LiBZKwlEaa	The team that best fits your description that is not the Steelers, Patriots, Cowboys, Chargers, and Panthers would probably be the Eagles.  They have a decent QB with Donovan McNabb who does a mixture of both passes and rushes, a pretty decent RB with Brian Westbrook who also works as pretty good receiver and some good Defensive players such as Asante Samuel.  That would be the team to go for if you don't want to go for the teams you said you wouldn't go for.|`|H5tvzBoGaa	The Tennesse Titans without Vince Young. That's who I like.<br>  Chris Johnson and anybody else with their offensive line = good running game.<br>  Michael Griffin, Cortland Finnegan, and Chris Hope = interceptions.<br>  Look it up. The Titans were tops in those categories.<br>  Mobile QB's don't win Championships. i.e. mcnabb, mcnair, vick, cordell stewart, anybody the jaguars try to put back there, tavaris jackson, jamarcus russell, donte cullpepper, etc.<br>  <br>  Besides the Titans I would have said the Broncos...Jay Cutler (who the titans should have drafted over Vince!) runs quite a bit, but with their new coach who knows what's gonna happen there.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	jags got great running game and david garrard is a good rusher don't know about picks.<br>  The titans are playing collins next year they signed him to a multiyear deal.<br>  Also Eagles aren't bad.<br>  1. McNabb is good at running and a great qb<br>  2. Westbrook is just amazing huge amounts of yardage<br>  3. Asante and Jim Johnson equals picks|`|jJjfeylmaa	well if the titans play vince young as their quarterback. thats your team, because he will single handedly provide each of the three things you are looking for! :)|`|aWYNkNgUaa	Minnesota Vikings or Philadelphia Eagles are 2 pretty good ones|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	umm thats up to you, and let me gusse you also want a team with a winning record.|`|fb274e1c130e4d0a026f6a12b3411894aa	why dont u be like everyone else and wait till after the super bowl and then pick the winner!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  **** that go denver|`|AA10366426	Good overall team coming in this year has to be a healty seahawks team and nate no vince young sucks he cant even win games he sucks and he sucks.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	if you refuse all the good teams, then be a Falcons fan|`|jLnXuam7aa	49ers|`|CL7OTeiCaa	Go with Denver. They had some running back injuries this year, but they will all better this year. When the running backs are healthy, they make a good impact. Plus they have Champ Bailey, one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, and Jay Cutler is not the fastest quarterback, but he can definitely pick up some yards when he is on the run. Or you could take the Eagles. Donovan McNabb is fairly mobile at quarterback, Brian Westbrook is one of the best running backs in the NFL, and Asante Samuel, a pro bowl cornerback gets quite a few interceptions. My favorite team is Tampa Bay, but they have sort of a weak running game, and have some quarterback issues. So, with the information you gave above I recommend the Eagles or Broncos.|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	definately not chargers it is in my opinion the Jacksonville Jaguars because Maurice Jones Drew is the RB and David Garrard is the qb and he is really fast and Mathis the defensive back is a great player for intercepting|`|6yknPnOVaa	Joe Flacco and Troy Smith = Mobile <br>  <br>  Willis McGahee, Le'Ron McClain, Ray Rice (Also known as the "Three-Headed-Monster") = Running Game<br>  <br>  Ed Reed = Interceptions<br>  <br>  <br>  Sounds like a Baltimore Ravens fan in the making.|`|HFGjaRYjaa	Probably Falcons then

VJwjkxBJaa	If you don't see any advantage, don't get the Look.  It's just one of those things you have to experience to understand - nobody can really explain it.  It's like the difference between cheap beer and expensive beer.  If you've never drank a beer, and someone gives you an expensive beer, how would you tell it was expensive or better than a cheap one?  <br>  <br>  I bought my first road bike for around $1000 and rode it regularly for about 18 months before I purchased a full carbon frame $3000 bike.  At first I felt like I was wasting my money, but I really wanted a "nice" bike.  Once I rode the bike the difference between it and my $1000 bike was HUGE, and the money spent was well worth it.  But, had I never ridden the $1000 bike for that long, I would have never known the differences between the two.  It just takes experience.  Just get what you think meets your needs, and eventually, if you keep riding, you might grow out of it and look for something else and be able to appreciate it.|`|HiAVqwHDaa	Unless you are a serious racer, it won't make that much of a difference. Plus with the cheaper bike, assuming the frameset is of relatively high quality, you can upgrade wheels, components, etc if you get into it more.|`|kZO68ex4aa	Depending at what level of riding you do every ounce is a factor, stiffness, geometry, handling, etc. The fact you are asking, I would suggest the lower price road bike. Fuji makes some nice reasonable road bikes....|`|Z5xgSATSaa	How far did you ride? This is important, a ride around the block will not really give you the full story, you need to ride far enough that you get to see how the bike acts in different situation, climbing hills, descending, taking corners , and seeing how the bike feels at the end of a long ride. My first carbon road bike was a Look, and what convinced me was how it felt after a 100 km ride.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	The Look is better, but the Trek is great and probably as much as you need. My first decent bike was a $1800 Mongoose on sale for $1200. I didn't see any reason why anyone would waste $3000+ on a bike. I used it for 4 years before I really got into it. Now I have 2 bikes, each more than I ever thought anyone should spend & loving it.<br>  <br>  I'm glad I did it that way, otherwise I would have spent $3000 on something I would have never gotten my money's worth before I learned what I needed. If you're not going to get the advantage out of the Look, get the Trek. In 3-5 years, you may want the better bike & there will be new innovations for the same money and then you'll be able to make a better choice & get the advantages the bike offers.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you have the money lying around, it's never a bad thing to buy more than you need. You might find yourself riding even more.<br>  <br>  Update: Usually the better money buys you a lighter, stronger frame and higher quality components (smoother, faster shifting). The difference in weight could be 1-3 pounds, but that could give you an edge in racing. Wheels, especially, can make a huge difference in weight & strength and could add another 2-3 mph to your ride.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	well<br>  it sounds like you don;t think it;s worth it<br>  so don;t do it<br>  <br>  my personal opinion is that after about $1000, you have reached the point of diminishing returns<br>  <br>  you can always get something lighter<br>  but it gets kind of silly after 18-20lbs<br>  <br>  in fact when bikes get really light and expensive, they are also delicate and short-lived<br>  <br>  so  they become even MORE expensive as you have to replace parts like the $5000 frame made of unobtainium, after one season<br>  <br>  wle.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you are not ready for a bike of the caliber. you can't feel the difference.<br>  ultegra is the second best shimano road group. the functions are more reliable, smoother, crisper.weight is lower. example if a person buys noname mac& cheese for .30$ why buy kraft mac&cheese at .90$. taste,texture.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	You'd be gaining nothing at all in performance as an entry level rodie.<br>  <br>  Use the tax money you'd be spending on the LOOK to get yourself an entry level road bike that fits you well. Proper fit is more important than how much the bike weighs.<br>  <br>  After you've gained experience and endurance on the heavier bike, then reward yourself with the LOOK or similar. You'll have earned it.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	The Trek 2.1 is an aluminum frame with carbon seat stays and 105/tiagra group...the Look is full carbon frame and Ultegra and you dont see the difference? If you are not a dedicated road racer then you do not need carbon frame bike....! The Trek is an entry level compact or triple crank and is just that entry level and the Look is professional grade....Stick with the Trek as it is more than enough for you since you have to ask in the first place! The potential to go faster is there with a much lighter bike overall however that speed is entirely up to the rider....and this LOOK bike is MUCH lighter and FLAT OUT Better equipped too!!!
jSkHquK5aa	YES he can. Hes not allowed to use his hand outside his box.|`|L1QTSErIaa	Yes he can... The rules allows it.|`|sKSeNAonaa	Yes. As long as the goalie doesn't use his hands outside of the box, he can bring it back in and pick it up. If a ball is poorly crossed, and it is just rolling towards the goalie, yet no one is chasing it, the goalie can either go and kick the ball or make a pass with their feet. The goalie could also dribble the ball back into the box, pick it up, and punt it.|`|d3jxARqxaa	I am a goalkeeper for my local high school team, and yes you can. It is completely legal,and its a good thing it is, or their would be some problems with keepers coming out of their box. But, yes, it is legal.|`|F3faAmsSaa	Yeah, but if he picks it up outside the box, it'll be a freekick or a penalty|`|RWmJpDdNaa	yes he can as long as his own team mate didnt kick to back to him if it was the other team then yes

ZKikquiOaa	You can always try it.  Worse that can happen is the arrow will fly about 4 feet and hit the ground.  Various types of wood can be used to make bows, not just Yew.  Something called the osage orange has been widely used here in the US.  A few modern recurves uses maple wood for it's core.  The key is in drying the wood.  When you have fresh wood, you need to dry it in a dark place for about 2 weeks to make it useable for bows.|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	Bows are traditionally made of yew wood - the famous English longbows were made of yew.

The second half of last year they eclipsed every other team in the comp except Geelong in win-loss and they have some real attitude this year.

GXMTwCLTaa	well start small, be confident, for jumps don't do tricks, be confident with the jump then do tricks, the landing makes the jump what it is, make sure it has a good landing, watch people do whatever you are gonna do first. Start out with thick not very highly raised box's first. then when you are very confident try a small rail;, they are very different. Start out with board slide on rails or box's. And a method for air tricks. that's where you bring the board back and grab it.|`|35face19fd15aa04efb8daf43a67e450aa	First of all, you should be very comfortable with a few basics before you start doing more complicated stuff.  Here is what you should be comfortable with: carving, going straight downhill very fast and then stopping, slowing down, turning without falling.<br>  If you are, then you can start trying some smaller jumps and some basic terrain elements.<br>  If you want to land 180's, then you HAVE to get comfortable with riding switch as well.  If you usually ride regular and you can't ride goofy, then how will you land a 180 off a jump?  Even if the jump and landing are alright, you will immediately lose control and fall.<br>  <br>  For jumps, you ALWAYS want to go over the jumps at low speed (if possible) before attempting them at higher speeds because A) you need to know what the terrain below the jump is like and B) just to get a feel for the jump.  You really should start out with smaller jumps.  If there are no small jumps around, find an empty space and make some small ones.  See if you can find some jumps with nice powdery landings.  You will be less afraid and will learn faster.  For straight jumps, you need to keep your center of gravity over your board.  You will see people trying to jump all day and their boards fly out from under them because they don't do that.<br>  <br>  Watch people who are better than you.  You can learn a lot.  Observe how snowboarders lean to one side or another going off a jump when they are going to do a 180/360/etc.<br>  <br>  Oh, also, you should be very good at falling.  No joke.  If you hurt yourself every time you fall, you are not ready for jumping.  If you can fall (e.g. if you hit an unexpected ice patch) and pop right back up without coming to a stop or hurting yourself, you are ready.<br>  <br>  I don't do terrain elements much but I know for boxes it is important to keep yourself balanced over the center of the board.  If you feel yourself sliding off the side of the box, just keep going.  If you flinch to try to correct it, your board will obviously fly out from under you and you might hurt yourself on that box.|`|AA10274973	you might want to start with boxes, those, as far as i'm concerned, are the easiest.<br>  <br>  you do not want to do any turns/curves (whatever you call them) before the box. what you do is slide down to a point where you will be able to get enough speed (10, 20 meters away from the box) to actually do the box. <br>  once you're there, use torsion to get into a position where your front foot is directly facing the box; your board should be in line with the box. <br>  the next thing you need to know is that your board should be totally flat as you approach the box. do not go on either edge, make sure it stays completely flat.<br>  while your board is completely flat, front foot forward, heading towards the box, you also need to do a few things with your body to make sure your box is a success :).<br>  these would be: making your center of gravity as low as possible, you do this simply by kneeling down and pretending to sit down. ride it monkey style, as relaxed and lowwww as possible. <br>  also, lean forward!! lean forward! lean. forward. sure, you won't be leaning forward for every single trick you ever do, but for the first few boxes, it's essential. don't underestimate how much you can use your knees to lean forward, bend down, etc.<br>  the last thing you should be doing with your body is having your arms out perpendicular to the board. think of it this way: your arms are like the balancing sticks that the guys on tightropes use. <br>  <br>  okay, so this might seem like a lot to do and then do the box as well. so, before you actually do the real thing, practice a few times on the bunny slope. trust me, it takes a good five tries to get the flat board, leaning forward, arms, and going low all right. don't worry about looking like an idiot. seriously, don't worry about it, it'll help you so much and make you look much less of an idiot in the park.<br>  <br>  okay, now that you know how to approach the box, what do you do on it? easy enough. just keep doing what you were doing as you were approaching it!!! keep the same position, maybe even go lower. keep the board flat, and just go where the board is going, don't try to steer it in any particular direction because it will only cause you pain and looking bad. if you got started well, getting on the box and keeping on it and riding it straightly should be no problem. at all! when approaching the box, get in line with it at any price - jumping, swinging your body madly... just don't start doing curves/turns. <br>  <br>  there's no need to fall, really. i read that one person said that you have to get used to the fact that you'll fall. that's not true, really, as long as you take it easy and go where your board is going (not try and make your board go where you want to go) i don't see how you would fall. <br>  <br>  start with an easy box, and two or three tries, you'll probably be ready for a box with a kink. the ones with the kinks, just lean forwards even more after the kink. lean forwards, low center of gravity. key to good boxes. <br>  <br>  another easy thing to begin with is doing a nose grab on the box. bend your front knee, stretch your back leg and reach for the nose. try to make your legs do most of the reaching work. <br>  <br>  for the rainbow box, you need to extend your body (stand up, as if you're jumping, but don't actually jump) at the first part when you're getting to the top, and when you're at the top, go right back down to a loooowww position.<br>  <br>  maybe this seems like a lot of unnecessary going low, especially for easy boxes, but it'll help you learn a lot faster and get into the habit of the body position you'll be needing for harder ****. <br>  <br>  if you wanna try kickers, i guess you could pretty much take the basics of doing boxes and try that out, but i think that boxes are the best way to start.<br>  <br>  if you don't know what torsion is, i can't think of any way to explain it other than what you do on this: <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T3RHR8B4L.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...</a><br>  you know, when you sort of "twist" your board (you don't actually twist it). basically, with torsion, one part of the board is flatter than the other, allowing that part of the board to go faster. so, if you press down on your front foot, that part will be flatter, that part of your board will be able to go faster, and you'll go from a motionless, horizontal heel position to your board turning, then riding, and your front foot being in front. <br>  <br>  have fun riding! you'll probably be able to master this in an hour :)|`|RX8ZES2zaa	start with box rails the wider ones because they are easier so you can get the main concepts to it then start with small jumps on the sides of runs then just go for the bigger ones but make sure you go slow because you can really underestimate the amount of air you can get but after a while you will get better at landing and it will not be a big deal
GVuTWQ6Aaa	There is no set in stone sizing anymore.. it used to be, a board should stand between your chin and nose.. but there is so much more to it now... you want a board in the right weight range for you, the right ability level, and then you want to get the right length, which depending on your ability and the board type, may or may not fall between your chin to nose.. it is best just to go to a shop and tell them what you want, and have them recommend something|`|35face19fd15aa04efb8daf43a67e450aa	The size you need is more dependent on your weight than your height, I think, although height does play a part. The taller you are, the further out you can lean, resulting in more pressure on the board.  So it also depends on how hard you are going to be on your board, which is to say are you going to be doing jumps and landing hard, or just gently floating down smooth powdery slopes?<br>  <br>  I don't know what you mean by "visually."  Here is a link to a snowboard calculator: <a href="http://www.frostyrider.com/tips/size-guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.frostyrider.com/tips/size-gui...</a><br>  <br>  Freestyle means you are doing lots of tricks (jumps, boxes, rails) and not much of the downhill stuff except just to get to the jumps and terrain park. Freestyle boards are usually double-ended so you can ride them equally well in both directions, but that makes them less good for downhill.<br>  <br>  Freeride style means you do a little bit of pretty much everying, including downhill and tricks.  Most people ride freeride boards, especially when they are starting out.  You would usually not get a freestyle board for tricks until after you got comfortable with just making it down the hill without falling.<br>  <br>  So, enter your height and weight into the calculator and I assume you are a beginner and want a freestyle board. Enter your gender and boot size, and when you press "calculate," it will give you the range of board dimensions you should get.<br>  <br>  It seems to work pretty well.  I am 5'10" 140lbs male size 9, intermdiate skill looking for a freeride/freestyle, and it said I should get a 154, which is exactly what I have.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  P.S. Avoid the trees: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_well" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_well</a>|`|GXMTwCLTaa	first if you do rails, etc. get a park board. you won't need a wide board. if you want more speed, get a longer board, if you want easy move ability for tricks and such get a smaller board. It should be around your nose height to your chin or forehead. The bindings will usually fit but ask a specialist, sometimes bindings are not universal for all boards. If your bindings have four holes to screw into a board, and if your board has four it will match. some Burton have 3 holes. so ask a specialist if what you want or have will fit.|`|CpYiJOB8aa	go to a snowboarding shop and ask someone who really knows what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  they can answer any question you want to ask them.

AA12325046	I think it's just a rumor myself as I kept up with boxing quite a bit back then, read every Ring magazine or boxing publication I could get my hands on and this fight was never really even mentioned.  Monzon ended his career at age 35 after 2 tough defenses against Rodrigo Valdez.  He was champ from 1970-77 with 14 title defenses and was undefeated the last 13 years of his career so he hardly had anything else to prove.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	no at the age of 35 in the 70s was a right age to go it would have been a great fight but monzon great career was set in stone if marvin started sooner maybe but he did not duck him|`|kqP7GwOcaa	They never fought, why is lost to history, but it's unlikely Monzon would have ducked anyone, ducking a challenge wasn't something a guy like Monzon would have done.|`|dh48AkbCaa	i think it's just a rumour, monzon was right to retire when he did, he had nothing left to prove, and we were not to know how great marvin was actually to become.
pR0pJNJkaa	He wasn't the greatest to be Heavyweight Champ. But for the time he was champ he was great. He beat everybody. He unified the title. He used his amazing reach to punish and hit and not be hit. There wasn't much competition but that's not his fault. He beat what was put in front of him.|`|SEEJxHk7aa	GREAT CHAMP DONT THINK HE WAS OVERRATED NOT WHEN UR THE UNDISPUTED|`|kqP7GwOcaa	For his era, he was the best, but Lennox doesn't rank high on my all time great heavyweight list.  His suspect chin hurt his historical legacy, and even though Evander Holyfield never beat Lennox, Holyfield rates higher over all.  Those who claim Lennox is a top ten all time great have him over rated, but he is definitely one of modern heavyweight boxing's best.<br>  <br>  I enjoy glactus's answers and I rarely disagree strongly with his takes, but he cannot seriously expect Lennox Lewis's chin to hold up against the likes of Foreman, Frazier, Liston, Dempsey, Marciano, Louis, Ali, Shavers, Moore or even lesser punchers like Holmes, Johnson, Walcott, Norton or Charles when guys like Rockmon and McCall KOed Lennox.  American or not, I met Lewis, he's a great guy and as his era allowed a great champion, but guys like Max Schmeling, Jerry Quarry, Jess Willard, Ron Lyle and Cleveland Williams would have given him some serious trouble along with a host of lesser heavyweight champs.<br>  <br>  In that regard, glactus is the example your question address's, and yeah they over-rate Lennox Lewis at this site if they share galactus's high opinion of Lennox.    Jack Johnson, Joe Louis and Ali would have easily exploited Lennox's defensive flaws, and his suspect chin would have done the rest.  I rate Lennox Lewis around the 17-22 range all time, and put Mike Tyson around 45 or 50 with a lot of non champions well ahead of Iron Mike.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	Both Blog and Galactus gave good answers and reasons but I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. I think that Lewis would of beaten the likes of Dempsey and Marciano would not be able to beat him because of the size difference. I think that Joe Louis would of gotten to his chin and stopped him, and I also think that Ali and Holmes would of outboxed him. I think that guys like Shavers and Quarry would of given him trouble with their own styles, but I think that he would of stopped Joe Frazier. Against Foreman it could go either way, he is the better technically, but Foreman is very durable and all he needs is one bomb. It is all in the styles and the strengths and weaknesses, certain guys he would of beaten easy and others who may not be as highly rated historically would be stylistically nightmarish for Lewis.|`|xlyk63xRaa	how can he be over rated if he defended his crown, avenged his defeats, and finished on top of his game, ok so u might think vitali won that fight...but by the end of the fight vitali looked like he had been fcked by a train....|`|dh48AkbCaa	no. he was a dominant champion, avenged his only defeats, and cleaned up the division|`|a4c7XSWHaa	no bro..you gotta watch some of his fights|`|805a76b8f5c2c8cc13c121d74753809aaa	i did, he was the last true champ in my book...he reigned in an almost depleted weight class. not his fault though. he is the weakest among the champs that he preceded, suspect chin, no good combination and a fairly power puncher. height and reach advantage plus a working jab is what all about lennox. he ducked klitschko, almost always after a fight, he praised and call out lennox to give him a shot to no avail, but finally getting a bout with him after years of avoiding, well probably of mandatory rules.<br>  <br>  to galactus and blog: guys, isnt lewis has had trouble with vitali? Ali, Foreman, Frazier and Holmes would win over Lewis...how about Klitcshko? Vitali was ahead on points but unfortunately was busted open during that bout, i almost think that he was the reason why lewis retired and the reason why he doesnt wanna step into the ring anymore.|`|8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa	Well, I'd say some might overrate him.  He might be ranked 1st when he's really about 3rd or 4th.<br>  <br>  Of course he's not overrated.  If anything he's Underrated.  Of all the champions I give only Ali and Holmes a good chance of beating Lennox Lewis.  Each of them is strong enough to survive his edge in strength and over come his offense.<br>  <br>  I give Larry Holmes the best chance to beat Lewis.  He's not as fast as Ali but still quick enough to exploit Lennox and tough enough to survive, taking him into the later rounds and stopping him.<br>  <br>  Ali has a bit more of a struggle on his hands.  He doesn't do as much damage as Holmes would do.  He could still halt Lewis inside the distance but the likely ending would be Ali by decision.  It would depend on how much Lewis' stamina holds up. <br>  <br>  Joe Louis is a smart boxer who would know HOW to beat Lewis.  However, there were also many who knew HOW to beat Mike Tyson.  The trick is actually EXECUTING the plan.  Louis might not have enough sheer strength and size.  True he has beatn bigger men than Lewis but NONE of them possessed Lennox' keen mind or his ability.  <br>  <br>  Because he's not American people tend to short change Lewis.  But in all reality, I don't see anyone else who would beat him.  <br>  <br>  Forman was too mechanical.  Old George can beat many of the men Young George beat or would have beaten.  Both would lose by KO to Lennox.  <br>  <br>  Tyson and Frazier are very different.  However, the one thing they have in common is the way both would lose to Lennox.  <br>  <br>  Dempsey and Marciano don't have a chance.  They're both too small and one dimentional.  Sonny Liston would have a puncher's chance but Lennox would exploit his flaws and stop him in 6.  <br>  <br>  Holyfield would do no better than he did in their actual fight.  It would be nice to have competant judges.  That leaves Jack Johnson to cap off the TOP 12.  He would be too small and easy to hit.  True he was a wiz back in HIS time.  However, that was before boxers learned to throw combinations and use defense.  Jack is certainly NO Muhammad ALI.  I have said and always say that, at best, Johnson is a poor man's Larry Holmes.  Anything Johnson can do Holmes can do better. <br>  <br>  Lennox edges Joe Louis but it could go either way for 3-4.  Louis is ahead because he has a better chance of beating Holmes.  In a series of 3 fights Holmes holds one over ALI and loses two.  Louis loses all three but two are close.  <br>  <br>  Lennox is stopped by Holmes and drops a decision to ALI.  He wins at least two in three against Louis.  It's very possible he wins all against Louis.  It all depends on training.  <br>  <br>  I don't see anyone else beating Lennox Lewis at his best.|`|zdQWVaGsaa	As much as I'd like to say "Yes" I have to say "No". He beat everyone he fought, avenged his losses and ducked no one. It wasn't his fault that Tyson and Holyfield were past their prime and that Riddick Bowe ducked him.<br>  <br>  Considering the poor quality of heavyweights today, Lennox was the king.<br>  <br>  I don't think he could have beaten a prime Tyson, however, or competed with the likes of the 70s heavyweights like Ali, Frazier, Foreman, Lyle, Norton, Holmes, etc.|`|vLD8L1P0aa	he is a great fighter but yes, he is way too overated<br>  i agree with you. But he DID beat Tyson witch puts him quite high. But he wouldn't be able to defeat the 60's and 70's champs eg: muhammad ali, george foreman, sonny liston, joe fraizer etc.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	The only knock I have on Lennox Lewis was when he clowned around with Rahman and got knocked out.  He was a great heavyweight in my book other than that.
ZjogJVgeaa	Definitely summer :) <br>  I love wearing booty shorts, tank top and heels :)<br>  Summer i where everything happens without any limit :)|`|V1Ods7dvaa	Winter, I like the adventure.

Salt Lake City also does the same thing.|`|6V8SH2NHaa	summer it warmer|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Summer cause it has better sports|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	I prefer winter as I find the hockey tournament to be the best olympic event of either games. <br>  <br>  Love both though.|`|tUDOJIFbaa	I like the Summer Olympics better than Winter because the whole world dominates it. The Winter Olympics is the most underrated Olympics and it is boring. Winter Olympians fall back to obscurity, but Summer Olympians aren't forgotten. There are more countries participating in the Summer Games than the Winter Games.

HOgan was a horrible wrestler stephanie mcmahon even said so but he was entertaining. and cena is todays hogan but with more talent and i dont even like cena i wish they used him as a heel. and if any1 wer to wrestle hulk itd b jericho with his legends suck storyline|`|CJzbIhWuaa	it wont happen, cena will be added to the edge/show match, i dont know, people dont seem to like hogan too much with his family issues so cena may get cheered|`|dUeDmb7raa	hulk hogan had back surgery like 2 days ago<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  so he is not competing at WM 25<br>  <br>  <br>  too bad though, i hate cena too|`|5oaOOquXaa	That'll    be     an     awesome   match,       it'll      probably    be    like     the    Rock's     match    with    Hulk    Hogan.
cc5d3a0becba844d46730088b2825968aa	Your offense is sweet!!! its well rounded. Ellsbury is well worth having in any league and Aviles is one of the bigger sleeper's of the year. But what is up with your pitching line-up. You should have at least one pitching ace on your team and one solid closer.<br>  <br>  I would give your offense a 7and a half and your pitching a high 2. You need alot of help with your pitching staff.<br>  <br>  P.S. I love the Youk pick, he contributes in almost every cat. so make sure u keep him.|`|Q5mllojUaa	only if the cubs had these people playin on the team. we'd win the world series every year. Cool list 5 outta 5|`|COGNhhYFaa	no offense, but your pitching needs a lot of work. u should at least try to trade for someone like justin verlander. im sure u could geta good deal for him.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Money, field availability, interest in general are some of the reasons why any sport doesnt get played at a high school level. Plus most states have gender equity so even a more popular sport may be cut on the boys or girls side to avoid lawsuits. Because field hockey doesnt get any exposure nationally in the U.S. it will likely never become a high school option in most geographic area's (although I am sure there are area's where the game is huge and heavily followed...I know it is true because some universities have it as a varsity sport). I have no idea if it is exciting at all, it isnt played in my area and best to not judge what I dont even understand.|`|jBXutMblaa	I don't know where you live, but nearly all of the public schools where I am have teams.|`|Uh0EGOu4aa	because it is a terrible sport.

5LXAhJktaa	You seem to be pretty decent size, so I would suggest possibly linebacker.  You don't need ridiculous speed, just average, and that's what you have.|`|xXa3eQOeaa	On Offense, try Tight-End(if you can catch,if not Offensive Line)<br>  On Defense, Outside Linebacker, or Defensive End.<br>  Part of the Coaches job is to find out what you are good at, then teach you how to play the position. The more positions you CAN play, the bigger the asset you are for the TEAM.|`|HFGjaRYjaa	Be a Defensive Lineman.|`|gq7HZoGRaa	Well if you gain about 15-20 more pounds and be able to put up at least 225 on the bench by the end of your junior year you can play tight end, but when your bench gets better (it will come in time), and your weight stays the same you should play wide receiver. Take it from someone whos played high school football before.|`|HnqedumSaa	hmm idk are you tough, tough as in are you willing to go in and get hit and hit people, if you are id recommend linebacker on defense, or fullback or TE on offense given you can catch and run, you ahve the height and size linebackers arnt the most agile but since u say u have decent speed its good|`|8A6n1AXLaa	wide reciever, if you cant catch that well than defensive back or safety<br>  and if your not to fast and can catch then play tight end cause you have the height to play WR, DB, and TE|`|xwi9BF26aa	can you tackle? if not i would say tight end

scW1feEWaa	shawn michaels becuz they have been wrestling together for about 20 years and hbk knows more about taker than anyone and is the only possible who has the heart to beat him|`|gVlTlpb2aa	the streak just like taker will never die|`|6E16tR6xaa	Noone! Taker doesnt asked for titles or many ppv victories, he has one thing and thats the streak. He makes the streak and the streak makes him!|`|lGIL36faaa	NO1...IM A BIG FAN OF THE UNDERTAKER AND I WUD HATE 2 SEE UNDERTAKERS STREAK END..THAT WUD BE JUST MEAN,,,UNDERTAKERS A LEGEND|`|HT1Ng5yxaa	No way. Undertaker should stay undefeated. My opinion.<br>  <br>  Dude below me....stfu seriously go play with BeeRad or something...|`|OHBvEYKHaa	no one especially not John Cena|`|ABRPsjwBaa	John Cena?Are you kidding me?!<br>  <br>  No one deserves to end the streak...EVER!!!|`|tnlHgiUOaa	Who deserves to end the streak? Well if anyone ends the streak then that wrestler would have to remain heel for years to come so I have two picks John Cena and Ted DiBiase. First off, I do not like John Cena but he has to turn heel again eventually and what bigger way to do that then to end the undertaker's undefeated streak at wrestlemania with the help of vinnie mac? That moment would probably be on par with hogan being the third member of the NWO. Second, Ted DiBiase has the main event heel look (sorry cody) and if undertaker is still around in a couple of years when teddy is in the main event then the booking could work too. Teddy could buy some help to beat the undertaker (creating his own stable in the process) and solidify a top spot as the new super heel.|`|mfNAdjVBaa	wow is he still around, dude must be like 60 now, what about 'Kain'<br>  <br>  <br>  Look I used to love wrestling as a kid my favorites were HBK,Undertaker,ManKind, Ric Flair(surprised I still remmember him) and sting<br>  <br>  but nowadays I think adult wrestling fans should get a life, it is like an addiction that consumes them<br>  <br>  not to mention its fake|`|LR3uJUswaa	1st choice: The Rated-R Superstar, Edge.<br>  2nd choice: The Legend Killer, Randy Orton.|`|8MmtBYlLaa	John Cena Or Jeff Hardy <3
kqP7GwOcaa	Yep, it makes more sense, unless your trying to flatten your opponent with an over hand right, it's more effective to jab then hook off your right hand as a converted southpaw.  Michael Moorer and Bronco McKart did it with considerable success, and it's also how I box.  <br>  <br>  The pros are that you can hurt opponents and bust them up with a stiffer jab, and land solid hooks off that jab.<br>  <br>  The cons are that you open yourself up to getting countered with a conventional fighter's own right cross, a potentially fatal flaw in the stance.<br>  <br>  So long as you circle away from a conventional righty's power by moving to your right, you can control a fight with your jab, but if you make the mistake of circling into a conventional fighters wheel house and move to your left while jabbing with your right hand, your gonna get your block knocked off.<br>  <br>  Like everything else, it has it's pros and cons, best advice is to fight the way you are most comfortable and work from there to improve your fundamentals.|`|nfJeZ27Haa	well a right handed fighter fighting south-paw will have a real strong jab n right hook but ur cross, hook n uppercut on the other side will not be as strong as they could be and there useally the power punches but haveing a good strong jab n lead hook aint bad ether but it all depends on what u do better with try on both sides n see witch one is more effective u know.....<br>  <br>  <br>  peace

6W68Qftdaa	I'm pretty sure the umbrella girls/ grid girls, etc. are local models hired by the local promoter of that race.  At every race there will be different girls.

54XYA1XZaa	There are plenty of great resources on the internet, and there are even camps to increase speed and agility, as well as QB play.<br>  <br>  Here are some great drills you can do to increase agility<br>  and speed.<br>  <br>                                           Plyometrics<br>  The main focus of Plyometric training is explosion.  Explosion is built by conditioning  Fast Twitch Muscles.  Fast Twitch Muscles control short, forceful busts of energy that are important to every position on the Football field.  The two keys to focus on while conditioning Fast Twitch Muscles are the landing and the counter action.

Agility is built by conditioning fast twitch muscles and body control.   Fast Twitch Muscles control short, forceful busts of energy which are critical for every position on the football field.  Body control is built by conditioning muscle strength and muscle memory.  Muscle memory is built by reps of a specific movements. The two keys to focus on while conditioning Fast Twitch Muscles are the action and the counter action.  Those two actions are critical to focus on while training Fast Twitch Muscles.  It is imperative that you properly stretch and warm up your muscles before preforming Fast Twitch Muscle exercises.<br>  <br>                                                           Bag/Cone Drills<br>  <br>  Strides<br>  Purpose: Footwork, Vision, Form<br>  Directions: Sprint over bags using high knees, and a forward lean. <br>  <br>  Double Strides<br>  Purpose: Footwork, Vision, Form<br>  Directions: Sprint over bags using high knees, and a forward lean.

Ask the Coach.<br>  Accuracy, "Practice, practice, practice". <br>  If you get bored, play Basketball. It helps you to make fast decisions, there is "passing" involved. The constant running, up & down the Court, will help your stamina, and help you to be in better shape.

Kennedy, CM Punk, MVP, Shelton Benjamin, Miz, Morrison are all good possibilities too.<br>  <br>  The Hardyz are expected to have a match<br>  <br>  a 25 Diva Battle Royal is scheduled, and have contacted many former Divas to take part such as Jackie Gayda, Sunny, Mae Young, Lita, Trish Stratus, among others,.<br>  <br>  Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title has also been talked about, but Christian may be used instead of Dreamer<br>  <br>  I was notified late last night that there has been some informal dialogue between Hulk Hogan and WWE about the possibility of him working a match at WrestleMania. However, no creative plans have been made. Hogan reportedly pitched the idea of working a match against John Cena. <br>  <br>  Stone Cold has also been rumored working a match against Hulk Hogan, but Hogan has had back issued recently and may be unable to work. Austin is prominently featured in WrestleMania 25 advertisements so I think he will at least appear on the show, the night after he is inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. <br>  <br>  <br>  Plans for Chris Jericho are still up in the air but i was told it will involve the angle with the legends. Mickey Rourke vs. Jericho was obviously the plan a couple of weeks ago but there has been concern from both Rourke and WWE about how it would go over. WWE officials are said to be concerned that it would be too big of a risk.<br>  <br>  Melina vs. Beth Pheonix looks likely for the Women's championship, but they may not have that on the card. Something involving Maryse/McCool may happen too. <br>  <br>  JBL was also scheduled win the IC title from CM Punk in the coming weeks, but due to the script being leaked, that may now have changed, but JBL was planned to make history by having the IC defended at WM<br>  <br>  These are the plans as of now, but Vince has been described as being "obsessed" with keeping things from leaking (see No Way out - using a curtain over the chamber pre=show to prevent knowledge of Edge being in both chambers) Plus plans change all the time, but these are what are known now.<br>  <br>  If you haven‚Äôt already, sign up to swag bucks and WIN SWAGS and FREE PRIZES<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=145837" rel="nofollow">http://mywwesearch.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb...</a><br>  <br>  Just search as you would every day, but WIN SWAG BUCKS as a BONUS<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|scW1feEWaa	morrison and miz will face carlito and primo and both titles will be on the line. idk whats wrong with mr.kennedy. hes been done with his movie for months and he still didnt start wrestling yet.|`|OfutBhxYaa	yes
aXdGCbEDaa	Because they were busy with Steph in the lockeroom...<br>  <br>  <br>  Na just kidding.As the user before me said,no one is supposed to be involved in the storyline.However,with the 3 against one thing,I have a feeling that we'll be seeing HBK or Batista step in.HBK,however,is busy with Taker,Cena is busy with Edge and Show,which leaves Batista who still needs to get payback for Orton's "kick of doom".I think that it'll be interesting to watch.However,I think that we'll be seeing a spot or two from Batista sometime soon.<br>  <br>  <br>  Evolution Reunion on the way?|`|hL3eS2zKaa	They didnt want confusion. And they wanted the storyline to kind of play out. It wouldnt make sense if Umaga came back up and start getting involved.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	no one is his tag team partner right now <br>  miss ballet if u dont watch wrestling then y r u in this section!!!!!|`|a8HFTnCKaa	Because wrestling is staged.|`|ABRPsjwBaa	The idea of it is that the storyline continues without anyone jumping in to avoid confusion and fans getting mad...|`|scW1feEWaa	no one else is supposed to be in the storyline because if they do get involved well the storyline will be all messed up.|`|GbBSA3Cgaa	Isn't he a wrestler (sorry if he's not, I don't watch wrestling...)?|`|dWJJ8vs1aa	i have no idea i hate randy ortan|`|m8QrLUhHaa	it was not in the script|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	cause of the story line and he got beat up so badly but  dont worry he is going to kill randy at mania|`|GJsIZeUIaa	Because no one else is supposed to be involved in the storyline.
JYErVWsJaa	1. Cuz Cena Sux<br>  2. Cuz it's all pg now like morrison said in the dirt sheet<br>  every wrestler is changing to pg; it sucks|`|ABRPsjwBaa	PG Era buddy,notice that they can't swear anymore?Because of the kids,pretty ridiculous if you ask me.<br>  <br>  I wonder what they'll do about the 5-knuckle shuffle now...|`|fvMv1DT3aa	Because this is the PG Era and they have to make everything appropriate for the younger viewers.|`|jyBjSfHbaa	F*** the WWE and their "PG" rating... It's all gay now|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	for the children.  did you really not know?|`|a6cb15fd4b323dbc753a289a5e6f7a87aa	PG|`|8h5dqzf6aa	because of the pg era|`|h5lOMoqBaa	I agree with Honky Tonk|`|QouSk1E7aa	OK, What's the big deal about PG? It was PG in the 80's and the 80's didn't suffer. All PG means is less sex and less blood. The 80's didn't need wrestlers cursing and swearing to get them over. You think Rowdy Roddy Piper and Bobby The Brain Heenan needed to curse to get over? The reason why WWE sucks today is because there is hardly any wrestling in the WWE (at least on TV), and TNA is just as bad if not worse. PG has nothing to do with why wrestling (at least in the mainstream) is sucking, it's the overuse of skits and ******* promos and not enough actual in-ring wrestling that's what is making it suck.<br>  <br>  Plus it's just a move name, and the move sucks anyway, so what's the point?|`|xBlKxxMvaa	if they did change it . it was probally for the little kida around 5- 12 possibly|`|qqLcvDDKaa	They thought "FU" as in "**** you"  was too adult for them.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	it is all about the little kids you see at raw and ecw|`|Xkm4PstOaa	"FU" has a bad connotation to it.  The WWE is now PG...hence the name change.<br>  <br>  Just like:<br>  <br>  "Legend Killer" is now "Viper"<br>  "STFU" is now "STF"<br>  "One Night Stand" is not "Extreme Rules"<br>  Etc...|`|gVlTlpb2aa	pg rating|`|hL3eS2zKaa	They changed it because of the PG rating and all the kids that watch it.<br>  <br>  Note to other users who answered:<br>  Im twelve and I dont give a sh!t about them saying F-U. Its not like I care about that change. I cuss all the time.|`|T13xM9iJaa	John Cena said in an interview that he chang the name because when he looks out into the crow he see more and more kids and he said if he is gonna be a roll-model then hes gonna have to make him self more kid friendly|`|aXdGCbEDaa	"PG Dude."-John Morrison|`|OHBvEYKHaa	PG era and becase oh yeah CENA SUCKS
SK0mtNknaa	the phillies r young so r the rays|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	The Reds have really intrested me.|`|KWwaxMTPaa	texas rangers|`|syzMIfLLaa	Texas, David Murphy, Taylor Teagarden, Nelso Cruz, Matt Harrison, Kason Gabbard, Chris Davis, Eric Hurly, and the minor league short stop has the same initials , E A, as Elvis Andrus who will be there rookie SS this year, so I Edited him and switched Mike Young to 3B, They were rated as having the number one farm system in baseball so who is better to play with in Franchise mode? no one.  by the way the Reds would be fun and challenging to play with too.|`|6BiiraLpaa	Minnesota Twins they got a very young team the average age is about 24 years i believe.|`|SqgXLLnwaa	I love doing the Fantasy Draft in every sports game, don't ask me why ahaha.|`|u1fK5CuNaa	Pittsburgh, Cincinatti or Washington.
5LXAhJktaa	0 out of 100.  Thanks for the free points!(?)|`|AA11720887	Decent infield with the exception of Davis. Ok outfield. Upton, Dukes, Lind are high-end free agents at best. Gallardo will put up some good numbers this season. Scherzer and Rauch are not closers and you shouldn't keep them. Scherzer isn't a good enough starter either. You have enough good closers. Kershaw will have a lot more SO's this season. Perez is a keeper. Zumaya will give you nothing of value. You need to check the free agent list and get rid of some of these guys and get some decent starters. Get a guy like Jim Thome or someone like him that can get you some HR's for a utility man. You have a lot of work to do. Good luck.|`|tkM1a0dWaa	7.8,  take out joel zumaya.  I am a tigers fan, but I know he will not preform this year.  Without hi 8.3.

LIKkt8djaa	If you're looking to do more freeriding then it'll be fine for your weight and height.|`|iT5vnplHaa	good size|`|35face19fd15aa04efb8daf43a67e450aa	Weight is really more important than height.  I usually weigh around 140-145 although I weighed 135 a few weeks ago for some reason.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I currently ride a 154 and I love it.  It is a freestyle board.<br>  <br>  Here is a site I found that calculates the board size you need.  It seems pretty good, since it calculated exactly 154 for me.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.frostyrider.com/tips/size-guide.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.frostyrider.com/tips/size-gui...</a><br>  <br>  Notice that if you increase your experience level from beginner to intermediate, it recommends a larger board for you.|`|GVuTWQ6Aaa	You need to look at the weight range of the board your looking at.. 130 LBS may be too light to use the board effectively.|`|CpYiJOB8aa	no

fAMpwF3Aaa	yes and yes|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yes and yes.  He played his whole career in GB and was one of their best QBs.  The one season as a Jet no one will even remember, and he'll always be thought of as a Packer.|`|CL7OTeiCaa	I say yes to both of your questions.|`|20zLmf3Laa	Yes the Packers will retire his number, probably after Ted Thompson (Packers GM) gets fired, because him and Brett are bitter toward each other, and yes he will go into the Hall of Fame as a Packer, and I'll even go out on a limb and say that he will be inducted by Frank Winters, his friend and former center for the Packers.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	They better retire that number. He is the best thing to happen to the Packers since...Lombardi. And he sure isn't going into the hall as a Falcon or a Jet.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	It will probably take some time but all will be good when the time is right.So my answer is Yes & Yes

qkvoAYoeaa	Being right handed your right thumb position isn't as nearly important as you left thumb position.  As you remember, left thumb and index forming a V to the right shoulder.  You should be griping primarily with your middle, ring and little fingers with your right hand and the right index wrapped around and gripping only lightly.  If your grip is correct the right thumb will find its own placing near and slightly left of the top of the shaft, and should rest only lightly there.  Keeping the right thumb relaxed promotes proper hand/wrist cocking and uncocking through the swing.  Only grip the club, with the gripping fingers about as firmly as you would a banana without crushing it.  The harder you grip the club the more restricted your hand/wrist action will be.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you have to experiment to see what happens with lil changes like that. thats how you get better knowing what effect swing flight control. we our selves are our own best teachers if you pay attention.|`|hwaBhUzJaa	Both thumbs should be on the center of the club. I went to a clinic last summer and the instructor showed me this. I have been doing it for awhile and my drives have gotten longer and much more straight.<br>  <br>  I had them put new grips on my clubs and they have marks where to put the thumbs and the are inline.|`|VoEf58UHaa	If you're right-handed the position of your right thumb is not very important. You do the least amount of gripping of the club with your right thumb. What is important is the vee that is formed by your right thumb and right index finger as the club lays across your right hand. That vee should point toward your right shoulder. The right thumb should rest, semi-firmly on the grip, where ever it falls as the vee is formed. Your slice will be less dramatic.|`|2fJLXXmqaa	Definitely in the center. When they are moved anywhere Else it causes you to make compensations. I used to have this problem, but my grip would get weak to fight off hooks,but it turned out that made me hook it worse because I would release the club too early to square the face.|`|IzN0nv9caa	Thumb position is important. If I put my thumb centered I slice the ball but if I move it a little to the left, it straightened my drives out. Just a slight change makes a big difference.<br>  <br>  Scott<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterGolfSpot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterGolfSpot.com</a>|`|AA10266909	Right thumb should be a little to the left of center
