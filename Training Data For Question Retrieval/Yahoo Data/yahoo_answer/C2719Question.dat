20090307021504AAjTmIF	Pets;Cats	How much does it cost to fix my cats broken leg? NEW QUESTION WITH ADDITIONAL INFO?	Hi there, we're in australia and our poor cat has just broken its leg. I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation, and what they paid to have it fixed?       Please no silly answers, thanks :)         Additional Details      I definitely will be paying for it - no matter what the cost is - however I wanted to know any estimates so that I know that I'm not being ripped off! I was quoted $2500 AUD (approx) for operation and antibiotics, xray etc      Ok to clear this up - my cat HAS been taken to the vets and is in very good care right now as he is still at the vets surgery and will be until the time comes for an operation - however the leg cannot be operated on until monday when he is able to be put under anesthetic. - my question is PURELY about the costs, and whether anyone with similar experience can offer advice on cost only - I would like to know what i can expect to pay as I am sorting out my finances this weekend.      Thanks everyone - again, no silly responses.

BUT she thinks she can only jump it at 50 miles an hour! I have worked loads on getting her canter sorted before the jump, and we have now reached a point where we have a pretty decent line into the jump. But now I need to work on stopping her after wards. After the jump she just runs, and doesn't listen to the bit at all. I end up having to turn her in about 10 tight circles to get her to slow down, and then we have to wait ages to calm down for the next jump.   So can anyone help me with some exercises to stop her rushing AFTER THE JUMP and to get her to steady so we can jump a course properly!      Thanks   XD   x

I can feed him at like 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. then walk him at 7:00 a.m. and leave for school at 7:20 a.m. Then when my dad comes back after dropping me and my brother off and gives him a quick trip outside fora few minutes before work.      then when I get  home I will walk him again and then feed him and play with him and stuff for the rest of the day.               while I am at school I want to leave him in the kitchen so that way if he has to "go" it has less of a chance of hitting the carpet. and I will give him water and a l

She was fine with them before, she didn't even bother them when they get near. But now, when they step on our property, she starts to bark, when they get too close, she'll attack them. This is scaring the hell out of the kids. No one's bitten yet. How can I train her not to bark and attack people? I can't even walk her since when she sees someone, her face becomes angry and she starts to growl.      Please don't tell me to bring her to a trainer or obedience school because I don't think we have that from where I'm from.

20090307035501AAoHxeJ	Pets;Fish	What is wrong with my fish?	I have had my algae eater for years and he has always been the same colour.  Kind of a peach colour.  Recently we had problems with the tank and had to put him in another tank, sort out the main tank and then move him back.  He now has a brownish colour on him that has gotten worse over the last week.  My husband used an anti-slime and velvet treatment a couple times thinking it could be that but it has made no difference.      We tested the tank before putting the fish in and since and all the levels are fine.  The guy at the local fish shop indicated it could be stress but looking at the fish makes me think it is something else.      Below are links to pics I took of him so you can see what I mean.  Any advice would be really appreciated!       http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7282/fish...     http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/3600/fish...

20090306163836AAkRNel	Pets;Cats	Soft Paws make a cat unable to defend itself from outdoor dangers, correct?	I don't have much experience with these things, but I just got them for my female cat so she couldn't hurt my bunny (she was just swatting at his face when he would approach her and didn't want his eye to get scratched or something).  Anyways, shes also a sneaky one and has managed to get outside 2 times in the past year.  Luckily I found her within 1 minute each time, but still it worries me.  So since she has soft paws on, I just began thinking that if she gets outdoors, she won't be able to defend herself, I don't think.  What do you think?

We never had him fixed before because he's our only dog, but for his behavioral issues we decided to.       Anyways every male dog I've seen that is fixed has no remnants of a "coinpurse" if you will. But my dog does? Its like they just took his 2 guys out & left an empty sac...      I'm wondering if it is because he is an adult dog, or if the sac will be sucked in or something? I've just never seen ANY DOG before ever with just an empty one, usually theres just nothing there. I know this sounds like a dumb question but any help would really be appreciated =]

20090306163544AAgN4Z9	Pets;Rodents	The ultimate rat trust win thingy?	Hello everyone! I've had my two rats for a year now, but one of them is still very erm... wild. By wild I mean he's very skittish and distrusting. He isn't scared of me at all, but he dislikes 'picky-ups' unlike his cagemate (different litter by the way), and has only let me tickle his ears and tummy in recent months, but only when he's busy sniffing something. His cagemate is a white rat with absolutely no fear of people, and loves attention. But my black rat is just so antisocial.    I've tried making friends with food, spending time alone with him, and I'm always incredibly gentle with him. His cagemate is wonderful and they were bought at the same time, but from different litters. Is it possible that this is purely a personality thing? Is there any way to win his love and trust?   I know he's well looked after, and happy. I just wish he was a little more amenable to the odd cuddle :)

I'm assuming that this is a safe method, am i correct with that assumption?      Thanks!

20090307030510AA6z0fs	Pets;Cats	How could I track my cat?	Well, what I want to do is have some way of finding out where my cat goes. He disappears completely and then reappears hours later, out of no-where.      I'm looking for any suggestions that would help me track where the cat has been, but preferably electronic methods, rather than learning what my cat's footprints look like.
20090227132643AAnQZzR	Pets;Dogs	Saint Bernard Question...?	I know that Saint Bernards prefer the cold to heat, but I was wondering at what temperature does it get dangerous for a Saint Bernard.       For instance, I live in New York (Not NYC) where winters are very cold (Anywhere from 15 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) and the summers get very hot (Anywhere from 60 to 90 degrees.)      Can I get a Saint Bernard, or would the summers to too extreme for one? I mean, I have done research and many websites say that they will be fine if they are kept in the shade and given a lot of water, but I just want to be sure that my dog won't pass out if I'm away for the afternoon.      Any answers are helpful. Thank you.

20090307020607AASu2Ux	Pets;Fish	I need advice on a SAFE filter to use in my Betta's' 3-5 gallon tank.?	I had the Tetra Whisper Internal Filter,1-3 gallons and it is about to stop working I'm pretty sure. It is running unbelievably loud and I have a feeling it is going to stop any day now. I was SO sure this filter was going to work fine,I threw out the box and receipt and stuff so I can't return it or get it replaced. I want to have the replacement on hand so that when it does stop I can swap them out and my Betta doesn't have to deal with the change. If I can not find a safe replacement for it,I will purchase another,but I will be SURE to keep the box and stuff. As far as use,I kept the water between 2 and 3 gallons,NEVER more than that. I changed the filter every 3-4 weeks. And there is only one fish in the tank so there was not that much waste. I watch and monitor how much I feed him. If he doesn't eat it,I fish it out of the tank. So,any suggestions on a safe filter to use in his tank?

All 3 dogs are over 4 years old.....I think the Pit bulls are 6 and the Husky is 4.      They asked me "Why are the dogs acting so agressively to the cat"      I told them "To seperate the dogs and the cat immediately. Most likely there prey drive is kicking in....I then said you know Both breeds have a very high prey drive?"      They responded "Dogs and Cats live together all the time just fine"      I responded "Yes usually breeds without a prey drive and if it is a breed with a prey drive they grow up together."

20090307031428AA6bHvb	Pets;Dogs	OWNING A BOXER QUESTIONS???	okay I want to get a boxer but I have a few questions.      first off I am in middle school and my dad works all day and my brother goes to elementary school. I have no mom or sisters.So no one will be home from 7:10 a.m - 2:40 p.m. (the time I get home.)   and I know a lot of you think I shouldn't get a dog b/c I go to school but my dad wants it too. so when I go to collage and stuff the dog will have a place to go.   anyway I have a schedule for the dog. a simple one but I think it will work. I can feed him at like 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. then walk him at 7:00 a.m. and leave for school at 7:20 a.m. Then when my dad comes back after dropping me and my brother off and gives him a quick trip outside fora few minutes before work.      then when I get  home I will walk him again and then feed him and play with him and stuff for the rest of the day.               while I am at school I want to leave him in the kitchen so that way if he has to "go" it has less of a chance of hitting the carpet. and I will give him water and a lot of chew toys and a little bed while I'm away.      my main question is will he be okay waiting until I get home with all of that?      or do you think I am gonna end up giving him too much or spoil him.?
20090227132059AAwb1Tc	Pets;Horses	Help.. Stirrup Trouble..?	Im having trouble with keeping my feet in the stirrup. Its really odd. Ive been riding since I was 5 and ive never had it before. I just got my first horse and have been training him on the ground for the last 3 months so havn't ridden.  It might have been because the last riding school i went to, before i got my horse, used stirrups with plastic holders to keep you foot in place. It only happens when I trott or canter. Any tips or advice to help me. Also i've always ridden with my feet sticking out because my dim riding instructer never bothered about showing us the proper way of putting your legs. Any ideas on how to get used to keeping my legs in the right possition? Its uncomftable and anoying. Please dont be mean, i was so used to having special stirrups that i've got to get used to it again.

20090227131628AA4VCO2	Pets;Cats	A kitten as a companion...?	i recently adopted a 2yr old male, a rescue cat. He came from a home where he was abandoned and left to go feral with 4 other cats. The other 4 were so vicious hey were put to sleep by the RSPCA, but he was saved by a cat rescue lady who took him home to her house.She had 20 or so other cats roaming freely and her house was alot like a colony(not very hygienic, or pleasant as the house was tiny and filled with rubbish) Anyway having brought him home he has hidden away refusing to come out despite feliway and rescue remedy, a room of his own and no pressure from us. there are no other pets in the house (or children) and I wondered if he may be lonely having always had the company of others. I have considered getting another cat or kitten as a companion for him, but I didn't want to leave it too long as he has not yet established his territory and so the two of them would not conflict(hopefully) Is this a reasonable idea, or should he just have the place to himself? He is Neutered, so I also wondered what sex the other cat or kitten should be...any advice would be gratefully received.

He has never ever done dis before in the 7 months that i have had him. He is only 10 months. He started picking up his left back foot for like a second then put it back down. Could this be because of the luxating patella or something elese? And does he feel pain when his foot does get stuck?

20090307071026AAr2nO4	Pets;Dogs	When can i feed my puppies 'puppy formula'?	theres six of them,   one of them (i've kept an eye on) keeps getting pushed; when   she tries to get some milk.                  * also; is this a good formula? *   ( http://leerburg.com/bottlefeeding.htm)       Bottle Feeding Recipe       11 Calories per CC      10 oz. of canned evaporated milk or goat's milk (not pasteurized cow's milk - this will cause scowers - dogs cannot drink normal cow's milk) Goats milk is by far the best to use. Wall Mart sells it.          3 oz. sterilized water (baby water or boiled water) this is not needed if using goat's milk         1 raw egg yolk         1 cup of whole yogurt (avoid skim or fat free if at all possible)         1/2 Tsp Karo Syrup or Corn Syrup (NOT HONEY !!!)      ****If you cannot find Karo or Corn syrup where you live, you can do a Google search for “substitute for Karo syrup” and get some options.****      When I Googled “substitute for Karo syrup" here is what I came up with- 1 c Karo can be subbed with 1 c white sugar and 1/4 c hot water (cook it to dissolve in the water best you can get it to. Depending on the recipe, if you need the sugar to be completely dissolved you might need to add a bit more water).      Place ingredients in a blender and blend or use a wire whisk. Be careful to not over blend and create a milk shake full of bubbles and then tube bubbles into the puppy.      Keep cool and discard leftovers after 7 days.      Warm formula to body temperature (dogs are around 101 degrees). Discard any un-used formula. This is a thick mixture - use a stomach tube to tube feed or enlarge the hole in the nipple for easy access for the pup.

So my aunts, boyfriend said that it was not being looked after properly and wold look after him if he could. Our dog was given to us from someone in the family due to having to many needs and he loved being with us. I feel so cheated that they have said this and that he wasn't looked after properly. He has heart problems so we stopped doing it as the vets told us it would be fine. What shall i say to them ?    its just really getting to me and making me feel like i shouldn't have my dog because i don't deserve him, even though im doing everything i can.

20090307061941AACsqHu	Pets;Cats	Is this true about kittens?	Is this true about kittens?   Well I'm looking to adopt a kitten at this bookstore i frequently go to called nine lives books. Anyway there were two kittens i was looking at, a black and white one which was VERYY playful and a siamese one which was kind of shy huddled in the back corner but still kind of friendly. I asked my friend which one she thought i should get and she said to get the siamese because kittens who are not playful and wild grow up to super wild and crazyy playful and that the black and white one would grow up to be dull and boring and no fun. I honestly dont think this is true because it doesnt even really make sense, but i just wanted others opinions before i make my pick. Please and Thank you:)

20090307062419AAUjcbI	Pets;Cats	Stories about your cat and the vet. How does your cat act when at the vet?	I adopted my cat 3 weeks ago, and this morning I took him to the vets to get his booster shots. In the car he was fine, I dont even think he was very scared because he was sitting there silently in his carier and his pupils werent dialated. He was like this in the waiting room too. He didnt meow once. But when we were called in, the vet opend the door of the carrier and put his hand in, and my cat hissed at him so bad lol. He tried again and he tried to bite the vet lol. So then he called in the nurse to help, they had to disasemble the carrier, wrap him in a towel and hold him down lol. Then as soon as the vet got the needle ready and lifted the towel a little, the cat hissed and flipped and bit the nurse and she was like ''AAARG. U LITTLE.'' I was scared coz i havent seen him like this. After 15 minutes of trying, they finally got it in and the cat was so mad. Then he tried putting the cat back in the carrier, so he held him wrapped in the towel, the nurse assembled the carrier and then cat wouldnt go in. Ended up making the vet bleed, but he still got in the carrier and home. My old cat though, used to be fine at the vets, she was scared but i could easily pull her out, and she would walk back in. What is your cat like at the vets? Any funny stories?

But I'm a little peeved that at no point are they showing ANY of the judging/breed groups etc throughout the day, just the final Group Judgings at the end of the day. Surely Crufts is about the Top Dogs out there, letting you see whos up and coming in the show world, appreciating other breeds and breeders etc, not just who's winning the Agility?!   It doesnt even give me a choice to watch any breeds being judged, just assumes I want to watch Agility/Flyball for 6 hours for four days! Anyone else feel that doing this kind of misses the point of them streaming it - seems they are bowing in a way to all the AR Protesters "Yes, we will rebel and show it.....but none of the actual breed judgings so no-one can complain"?!!         However, I am rooting for the Cippenham Micro Chips Agility Team in the Minis!!! How about you?!

I let the incubator heat up to 83 ish.      Then one of the ball pythons laid one egg and pooped.  I put the egg in the incubator.  Within 2 hours of doing so it started to sink in.  I don't know why.  I added water to the under tray of the incubator.  I have them in deli cups on top of hatch right. I added some water to the hatch right as well because i thiought it was a humidity issue. 2 days later is was molded.  I threw it away.      Well last night she laid 7 more eggs and it looks like she has one more to go.  I put the 7 eggs in the incubator.  I misted the hatch right with some water and put water in the middle thing.        I just did this about 5 min ago.  I want to keep these eggs from sinking in and molding in too.  What am I doing wrong or was the first egg just a dud?      Thanks

20090307053146AAgqL2x	Pets;Fish	Midge worms in my mini 20 gallon "pond"?	i have a 20 gallon "pond" in my garage. It has 2 3inch goldfish in it (i plan on upgrade them to the 50 gallon on my deck this spring). I  clean the Fluval 2 plus filter every week (7days).  I have had the tank for 5 monthes and have had no problems for the last 4 monthes. I also have a couple aquatic plants and i DIY CO2 system to help the plants.      The problem is when i clean the filter i see all these slimey strings. For the past 5 monthes i thought this was just fish poo so, i have been rubbing it out in the bucket of fish water to clean the filter. Yesterday while cleaning it i somehow rubbed offf the slimey coating and this worm was in the middle! This really freaked me out! i thought it was a parasite or something but i did some research and found out they are midge worms. EVERY SINGLE SLIMEY STRING WAS A WORM! I also know they got there by little flying midges. There are PLENTY of these around my tank.       So the questions:          1. are these harmful to me or my goldies?       2. can i get rid of them without medicines?       3. can i pour then down my drain safely? or should i pour them outside?       4. Am i freaking out for nothing?       5. can i feed them to my fish safely?       6. Whay are they in my filter?       7. Could these be another type of worm?      Number 3 is really imporant. I dont want these things to clog up my drain and breeed like crazy. I havent had problem so far, but i jsut want to see others' opion. also, would pouring the water in my back yard be releasing them to the wild?       Sorry for all the detail but i have invested a lot of money on my fish and really love them. I would hate for anything to happen to them!      Thank you,      NEMO  <  <  <  <  <

My cat likes to knock the top of the filter on my fishtank either behind the fishtank or into the fishtank. We were wanting to know if this would have caused the tear in my shark's dorsal fin (by landing on him), if my cat had tried to snag it with his paw and accidentally tore it, or if my shark's just falling apart from old age. We're not home for 8 hours because my sister and I are in school and our parents are at work, so we don't know what goes on when we're not home. If you can tell me what's wrong with him, that would be great help!!!

I have made her an apointment to be fixed. Well #2 cat that isn't fixed excasped from the house and was gone for a total 1 week. She just came back this morning well when she came into the house #1 cat when straight up to spook smelt her than try attacking her. I ended up putting her away in another room so #2 cat can eat n drink . When she was done I wanted to try reuniting them again so I let#1 out when she came out she was all alert n just werid n once again she ran up in try attacking her or she would gave her ears back and growl in state at her than #2 try going near her so I just put them in seperate rooms. Normally if I bring in a kitten to show them they Hiss and stay away never do they run n try to attack so why us #1 doing that???? How long should I keep them seperate? Until I give #2 a bath? Because of the smell? I don't know I'm just concerned. Also if #2 happen to get pregnant while she gone in her appt to get fix is next weeek will they be able to tell even if itsl early okay thank u
20090307061122AAFeKFE	Pets;Birds	How can I get my budgies to trust me?	Ive had my Budgies for about 3 weeks now. They live in a fairly small cage when we put them to bed, but during the day we let them out onto a tree we have in the room, which they love. The hard thing is getting them out, they all flee in terror and its hard getting them back in, they again, flee like we are going to murder them. We have it easier with the two younger birds, but the two parents are always terrified. Especially the father bird, we have to have him tire himself out in order to grab him, since he cannot be finger trained cause he is paranoid or something. Is there anything I can do to help get them finger trained faster, or able to trust me?

He's wanted one for a few years now, and his birthday is coming up, so I'm really looking for one for him.   I'm aware that they are pieces of crap, that they don't live for more than a short while, and that only sh*t-breeders will make them -- but if he really wants to waste his money on vet bills for it for 6 years, he can go ahead.   I don't wanna pay more than 100$ for it, since they have such a short life-span, and they're crap.         I'm in NY.   I've looked at kijiji, craigslist, and i've searched on the internet for "breeders".   All of the prices were too high, or it was an older one.         Any ideas?

In it 5 average-sized people are riding in a carriage being pulled by two horses on a dirt road (I'm making the horses male and I hope this is okay.  Perhaps they wouldn't work together?).  The horses are going neither quickly nor slowly but at an average pace.  They are average-sized.  They are traveling the distance it takes a person 2 hours and 15 min. to walk.  Can anyone tell me about how long it would take the carriage with horses and people to make this same distance?  I know this sounds like a bad math problem, but I can't go on with my story until I figure it out!  If anyone could figure out this same distance with a donkey this would help, too, but I'm not asking for a miracle.
20090307071250AA74kha	Pets;Dogs	My dog Gizmo has a lump, what could it be?	Okay so I gave my little 13 week old Shitzu, Gizmo, a bath this morning. As I was blowing him dry I noticed a lump on his underbelly. Now, we haven't taken him into the vet yet for his first shots, or to have him neutered so I knocked those two out right away. It's right above his penis, and about the size of the top half of my thumb. It's soft, as well. I'm worried about him. Should we try to get him into the vet today or monday?       Yours,      A concerned Puppy Mom.
20090307071410AAernW7	Pets;Cats	Are ScatMats effective for preventing cats from scratching furniture?	I want to buy a ScatMat (it's a mat that provides a harmless, small electrical shock) to put on my new couch to train my two cats not to go on it or scratch it.  I'm just not sure how I'd cover the arms of the couch though, since they might like to hop on those and scratch the corners (they do that with my chair).  Would the ScatMat teach them to avoid the couch altogether or just to avoid the area where the mat is?  Also, could I cover the mat by placing it under the sheet I'm using as a slipcover, or does that make it ineffective?      Thanks!  I appreciate your help!

20090307074842AAJqDge	Pets;Birds	How to cut parakeets talons?	If they are not tame and their talons get stuck in the toys. How would you cut there talons if they aren't tame. Do you go in and take them out of there cage even thought that's their home. Does plucking them from the cage with out being tame destroys all of the trust that you have with them so far. And if so how would you go about doing so. I have a wash cloth and a pair of nail clippers not bird ones thought. I also know where the quick is and if they do bleed for any reason I do have flour or cornstarch. I have read about it but this will be my first time doing so. And I want to make sure I am doing this right so they don't become hurt in any way. This may sound kind of funny but I really do care for my birds alot and I dont want them to get hurt in any way.

20090307073517AArLnE7	Pets;Dogs	A good way to get rid of fleas.. for good? Will rate best answer.?	I have a 3 month old chihuahua, and i stay out on a game reserve. There arent many fleas around in that area...      But when i come to visit my dad, my puppy always gets fleas because the bigger dogs have fleas. They are dalmations. He recently got real bad with fleas, that he was scratching himself open even though i had bathed him in anti flea and tick shampoo. It worked for about 2 days, and the fleas came back again. The vet gave him shots for the itchiness, and some antibiotics.      My problem is that we cant bath the bigger dogs ourselves because they put up a fight, and even if we did, there are other dogs from the neighbors that roam into our yard and possibly bring the infestation back. Its really irritating as the fleas are everywhere. And they just keep coming back. The big dogs were going to go to a parlor for grooming, but they attacked the parolor guy so bad when they were being muzzled that we were fined for it.      I was told by my vet to bath my Chihuahua once a week to keep the fleas away, but the anti flea and tick shampoo here doesnt do much good for long, and is only temporary which lasts 2 - 3 days.      What other methods are there of getting rid of these irritations? Ive heard that Some sort of garlic drives them away of you feed it to the dogs, because they dont like the taste that much.      Any advice would be welcomed.      P.S. Stupid comments will just get a low rating.       To those that give sensible answers, thank you! Please provide a source if you have one!
