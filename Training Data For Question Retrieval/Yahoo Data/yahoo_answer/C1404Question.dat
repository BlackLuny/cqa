20090309120809AAQE82U	Social Science;Psychology	Help for someone who can't find her way in life?	I am so impulsive and indecisive. I believe I have a lot of common sense but I can't seem to put it to good use. For example, one day I will say with conviction that I do not want to have children, and the next day I will be excited at the thought of having my first child.       This problem affects my everyday life. I get an impulse to buy a house and move away or to start college classes and I rarely follow through with these impulses mainly because I have my boyfriend to keep me sane and logical. I have so many dreams and ideas but they never manifest out of fear of failure.       Please can someone tell me why I have so many impulsive, indecisive drives and why I am not able to follow through with my ideas. Is something mentally wrong with me?
20090309122024AArkD6r	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I feel so bad now?	Last week I was kinda bullied into playing tennis. I thought about it and finally I agreed because everyone was nagging me. I thought it would be something to do and I could have fun.      But I've been thinking and I finally decided not to do it because they have practice everyday until 5, sometimes 7, and I'm not willing to make that kind of commitment. Plus I would have to pay $60 for a racket and probably $35 for a bag, and theres tournaments and scrimmages on the weekends.      But now that I finally stood up for myself and said "No I don't wanna play", I feel bad because I already told them I would play.      Aghh, why do I feel so bad? I finally stuck up for myself and I feel like crap.

20090309135102AADg8bG	Social Science;Psychology	People remember me for my past. I hate it. Help?	When I was 14-15 years old my father walked out on the family after lots of fighting between him and my mom. I had no role model or anything, and I had to help raise my brother. Instead, I hung out with the wrong crowd and got into the wrong things. I fought alot of kids, and rumors circulated that distorted things. I get reminded of things that are news to me, things people made up, that makes my name as bad as Adolf Hitler's.      In reality all I did was get into fights and chose to take home schooling instead because I couldn't deal with the pressures of public school. I think it was the best choice I've made. But now, five years later, and lightyears ahead in maturity, I still am reminded of my past. People from my town hate me, people are afraid of me, even now that I'm approachable and friendly. People from my town in college who didn't know about my past, well, lets say, I cared about these people, they found out through a friend, and now they avoid me like the plague.      Anyone here a victim of rumors? These aren't average "he's gay" rumors. These are rumors that would make you tremble for your life around me. I'm so ashamed of this, and there's no way I can turn it around since the kids who started the rumors spread them like wildfire and I wasn't popular enough back then to have enough social leverage to disprove them. I went from average hormonal kid to juvenile monster through someone else's fabrication, now I can't live with it as I'm reminded of these teenage rumors and rivalries.      I'm not as ashamed of my past as I am ashamed for the creative and distorted rumors that were made out of it.      The rumors people made up were that when in reality, I was home schooled for two years, people said I was put in jail for two years. People said I got raped in jail and brought knives to school, when I never went to jail all I did was get suspended for a stupid scuffle in the schoolyard.      I feel miserable someone I cared for is avoiding me because of these stupid rumors!
20090309131552AAkDLrW	Social Science;Psychology	Stress responses in dreams?	At the moment I'm trying to be less stressed - to relax more and to be generally more calm. It was going well, but a few nights ago I had a dream where I was really really stressed out and was screaming so hard that I was barely making a sound. I know what typical stress responses are; my question is do these responses apply if you dream of a stressful situation?      It wasn't a dream about anything that is stressing me out.. in the dream someone cut my hair into a square shape with a big bald bit. I went ballistic. So, would my body have produced the same stress responses as if I was awake in a stressful situation? Ie increased heart rate + blood pressure, more adrenaline, etc.

20090309135601AACQ8p1	Social Science;Psychology	After your mother died, how depressed were you on your next birthday?	My mother died in October, 2008.  Today is my 47th birthday.  It has been 5 months since she died and of course I have good days and bad days.  I miss her so much.   I've never been one to fret over birthdays and getting older, but THIS year is very difficult for me; it is my first birthday without a mother.  I did not react like this after my dad died and I'm thinking it is because my mom actually gave birth to me.     I have a lot to live for but honestly sometimes I cannot imagine going on like this.  It is just my husband and I.  I love him dearly; he is a wonderful man.  I am NOT suicidal.  But this loneliness is destroying me at my core.  We have no children.  I have two brothers but I am estranged from one.  The other is single and without children.  I love him and enjoy being with him but he lives a single life and we don't spend much time together.        Is this normal?  I am not always depressed.  I laugh.  I function.  I have goals and projects.  But when the grief hits....it hits hard.  I feel like such an orphan.        Can you share your experiences and how you got through this?

Under what circumstances, would you allow, a person to be killed, not by your hands?

Until I started going through the DOJ statistics and found out that more and more people are actually acting out on their intent. More than 17,000 murders a year, registered, which means generally 20% more are committed, never registered.       So, once again. What would be your personal tipping point to kill someone, and the social tipping point?

So they've been taking care of their wills and what not. My fiance is inheriting their house (they live in a house that used to be a plantation. It was built in 1823 I believe), anyways, it's been kept in the family and since we are getting married, they are giving it to us.      Not only that, but it has an old shed out back FILLED with a bunch of stuff. They were afraid to let their kids go through it because their kids were going to sell pretty much everything that belonged to them. So they allowed my fiance to go out there and take anything and everything we wanted. Well, there are TONS of stuff I found that I want to keep. I'm a history major and I love collecting old stuff. I don't want to give any of it to a museum as selfish as that sounds, though I do want to take care of these things and store them correctly. The house has a huge attic and I plan on putting everything up there in class cases and what not. A lot like how people display china in dinning rooms. Anyone have any tips to offer me about preserving these antiques?

20090309141350AAYm762	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream where rat talked to me? What does it mean?	I had dream that I was having tea outside with a friend and she became intoxicated from the tea. I started to be alarmed assuming that drugs were in the tea.      I then saw a giant bald rat, I tried to run away from it, but my feet were stuck. Then it stood up and asked if it could have some food. My friend had slurred speech and told him that he was not allowed. I called him rude for barging in. He then told me that I needed to take more chances. He grabbed some bread and I asked him what he was doing and he replied "living life as it should be."      The bald rat went away.      I left my friend outside and ran into the house, as I headed toward the stairs a homeless man was laying at the top. He looked like a filthy drug addict. My dream ended by me trying to go around him, as he was trying to grab at my feet.

I was prescribed prozac for depression but had to stop taking it as I had horrible reactions and feelings from it and ended up in hospital.Honestly although I can be depressed,Im not convinced whether or not I have depression.One of my biggest problems is just big self destructive urges.Like I stopped eating properly for about 2 years,and that was after I made an effort to stop self harming,so it was just like I switched from one thing to another.   When I went out a few months ago,I drank so much I blacked out and hurt myself,which I had to go to the hospital about.      Before that I took cocaine that a random stranger gave me in a club,I drank a lot too.I also had unprotected sex with a stranger,which I am ashamed of.I did these things on differint nights mostly.      I first deliberarly harmed myself at 11 so feeling like this isint totally recent.      Is there any mental disorder that causes massive self-destructive feelings?      I have an appointment next week with my doc to talk about the prozac reaction,but he knows none of this stuff,is there anything a doctor can really do to help in this situation?      I would like to be more open with the doc but its hard in a 10 minute formal situation.      I do feel very depressed and a feeling of dread but then ok for a couple of days.

20090309143412AAeslh9	Social Science;Psychology	Any paths out of this Escapist maze that I call my life?	don't cringe at the thought of a challenge but honestly fail most of the time. What is a guy like me to do with failure that I can't learn or improve from? I know it builds character, but sadly it could be nothing more. I live in a world that to me is just as unattainable as a fairy tale. Which is why I live in a dream-like movie heavy state of life. I do not much more with my weekends than either read a good book, or watch a good movie. My only friend I can really hang out with which I painfully regret is a woman older than my mom who has as many problems than me. There's no dignity at all in spending you life with a grandma figure. I just don't know if it is worth it to fight the struggle anymore. Should I accept mediocrity? Is there anything else in store for me? Because you don't know my struggle it may be hard to understand this question but in a quick description here are the struggles I face. I am not good at nearly any subject at school. I am physically incapable of playing almost every sport. Everything that takes a good brain I am uneligible for almost, I have horrible orginization, social skills, work speed, the list could go on. I am not being negative, this is the truth of my life. For me to succeed in life would take the patience of a saint. And if I accomplish anything it would be at a tremendously slow pace, and it may never happen what the hell was I put on earth for? I think I have the worst memory ever recorded in history.

20090309144708AAU87U0	Social Science;Psychology	I don't feel loved from anyone?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks

I'm fine around my very small group of friends though. I have no idea how I made them, I am actually awful at small talk and other necessary stuff to make friends. I have trouble showing my negative emotions. If I'm angry or upset people seem to take offence like I'm only angry at them and no one else. But when they're angry everyone seems to know. How can I show my emotions better?

20090309154506AAwgMYx	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	A question about feminism, equality, and guys who hit girls?	First of all, I in NO WAY think hitting a girl is EVER right, that's what the door is for, to leave in a tense situation and hit a volleyball or something.      Anyway, I was just wondering, that girls want to be equal, and want to be treated the same, and that's what the whole feminist movement was all about etc. etc., but I wonder, as a society why do we let a girl hitting a guy slide but totally go crazy when a guy hits a girl? like I said before I don't think anyone hitting their significant other is right but I always notice that people make it seem as if the female is weaker and that you're not supposed to hit them because they are smaller, not as strong, etc., and isn't that pretty much saying that we're not equal and pushes back the whole ideals of feminism?

Quite frequently when I go somewhere with my Mexican friend who is a male, women stare at me like they wish i would fall off the face of the planet.  It isnt just when I am with him, but i noticed it happens more frequently.  Sometimes they just look at me and giggle with their friends while they look over at me.  Why?  Men are always extremely kind to me but many women here are quite intimidating with their stares and comments.  Can someone help me to understand why this is?  Is it simply because I look very foreign?
20090309151631AAYAMFG	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What is the equality status of 'counterbalance' laws?	ie - because women can have an abortion, men should be able to financially opt out of parenthood as a 'counterbalance'.  Women should not have equality in this new right, as they already have the 'similar' right to an abortion.      Clearly, counterbalance laws are not the same as equal rights, since they are different rights based on gender.      So would 'counterbalance' laws help or harm equality?  And what are the possible ramifications - ie, women have to suffer period pains, so men should be punched in the stomach as a 'counterbalance'?  Obviously that's kind of crazy - but aren't counterbalance laws heading towards a kind of twisted socialism, where laws are based on 'similar outcome' rather than equal rights?      And can those in favour of counterbalance laws admit it is not equal rights they are seeking?  :-)

20090309153731AALa0vb	Social Science;Psychology	How do I become less dependent on my boyfriend?	I asked this earlier, but in the wrong section.       I feel like I've become emotionally dependent on him, and he mentioned it, too. He asked how was I going to survive when he gets deployed *he's a Marine*, to which I replied that I would deal with it then.      We've been together for almost a year and a half, and I've never been this bad. But honestly, I think it's because he's just gotten home from training. I went from seeing him everyday in high school to barely talking to him and seeing him maybe 4 weeks out of 7 months.       Can I get y'alls opinions, please?      I mean, my life doesn't revolve around him. I have a job, I'm working on my photography and I'm in collage *not currently, though. I had to drop the semester for personal/medical reasons, but I'm going to start back up in the fall and go for a Nursing degree*.      I love him very much, and I don't know what I would do without him.

20090309162904AAfrkS8	Social Science;Psychology	What do you think this dream means?	Me, my aunt, my grandma, my brother, and my uncle were all in my grandma's house. My brother left and everyone else was still there. My father broke in and held everyone hostage in the house. (My dad is a sociopath in real life.) I had to sneak past him and climb through the window before he could catch me. He saw me as I was climbing out the window and started chasing me. He almost caught me but I got away and called the police. He was arrested and everything was back to normal.       I know you can't get a complete meaning, you can only get an idea. Well I want your opinion as to what this dream means. This never happened in real life.

20090309172300AA5ovvp	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had the weirdest dream EVER, what does it mean?	i know it's riduculous, but im not joking i promise.   I dreamed that i was babysitting a fetus. But the fetus could walk, and it ran faster than me. It was still really small though. It was mean. It didn't talk, but it had this mean vibe about it.   The fetus was trying to kill itself because it wanted to get me in trouble for letting it harm itself. My friends were supposed to help me babysit it but they ditched me to go surfing. (we were at a beach house for some reason) The dream ended when the fetus electricuted itself under a bed and i had to get out of town before i got in trouble with it's parents.      yeah i know its really weird haha but what does it mean?      (and no there is no way im pregnant)

20090309173809AAe4pEg	Social Science;Psychology	What could this dream mean? (sorry if it's really long)?	I had a dream I was walking home, but got lost. I was near my old neighborhood so I decided to go to my friend’s house to stay over for the night. Before I went in this little girl (all in black clothing) stared at me, sitting on my friend’s front steps. She was so pale and had an innocent look. I didn’t want to be rude so I smiled at her while ringing the bell. The little girl gave me a discourteous reply. I asked her to get away from me but she wouldn’t go away. I went into my friend’s house and I asked her if I can stay over as I locked the door (so the girl couldn’t come in). My friend said “Absolutely not” but was still smiling. I begged her and felt like crying because I was lost. She still said no. I stood over anyway and went into her room. I saw the little girl again and my friend saw her too. She was saying mean things to us. I couldn’t take it anymore so I started punching her (a little girl!) but my punches were weak so I stopped and tried not to cry. There was a big aching lump in my throat from holding it in. Then me and my friend wanted to kill her so we tried suffocating her, stabbing, even drowning her and she wouldn’t die. My friend’s father came out of no where and had a smile on his face, telling me I couldn’t stay. He put me outside and locked the door. The little girl was outside with me. She kept saying the rudest things, and it was hurting me like I was being stabbed in the heart each time, or like someone was banging my head with a hammer while putting a loud whistle in my ear. I walked around a few corners (but not too far) to see if each way looked familiar, and led to my home. The little girl kept following me, saying the worst things. It was about 3am I still couldn't find my house. No one would allow me to sleep over (none of my friends) and right there I burst out crying in front of her and she went away.      What could this dream possibly mean?!   Sometimes I don't pay attention to my dreams, but I felt this one had something towards me, not just something random.      Thanks in advance

20090309181018AAVWdOJ	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think i Should tell him how i feel?	Ive known him since we were 10 and I am completley crazy over him, We were sort of close when we were younger but since we entered highschool we heavent spoken at all.. We both liked eachother when we were younger and we still like eachother now.. its just we hang out with different people and every chance we get to be alone we can never find the right words to say to eachother.. cause we went so long without saying anything.. (if that makes any sense)..      I left highschool in 07 (droped out due to personal reasons) and our grade graduated in 08 .. fast forward to now, I see him EVERYWHERE I go.. and ever since I left highschool i cant stop thinking about him.. he was essentially the FIRST guy I have ever really crushed on, hes the first guy who I ever truly wanted.. I dated one guy in highschool and that was only because he begged me and i felt bad... it did not last long (lasted for a week) and my crush thank god did not find out. My crush is the ONLY real guy i wanted and the ONLY guy i still want !       So I havent been with another guy since and i am going crazy for him and I think he is going crazy for me because i literally saw him a few days ago driving by my neighborhood and he stopped his car JUST to watch me.. i didnt know who it was till i got closer to the car and saw him.. as soon as he noticed that I noticed him he drove a way.. Im still in shock that he actually STOPED his car to watch me walk past his car... which took about a good 20 minutes from where i was..       I guess some things never change.. I dont know how to go about contacting him.. I know he probably will never get the guts to tell me how he feels just because of the kind of person he is.. hes the kind of guy who keeps his emotions in and it takes alot for him to open himself up to people..Im like that as well but Im at my breaking point now..       He doesnt have a girlfriend and never dated anyone in highschool for obvious reasons lol.. and I think i might be in love with him..

Okay so on September 23(2008)? i believe they took him to the hospital because he was having a hard time breathing. anyways, a few days after that they put him too sleep cause his lung collasped & they could put tubes to his lungs to help him breath. days passed and he hasnt woken up he did bad some days and good other days. his organs started failing. then sometime around October 8 he started to move his fingers, move his tongue, smile but yet he wasnt awake & then he really tried waking up later that night but they had to put him back to sleep supposedly cause of the pain or whatever which i completely understand but it bugs me that he was almost awake it didnt seem fair to me! okay so, i really didnt get to visit him while he was in the hospital cause i couldnt find a ride to miami. and to this day, i hate how yet i tried everything i could to go see him at least one time and i didnt make it on time. :/ so A few days before he passed away I had went to bed crying & i had this dream. I wasnt sure if i was awake or not cause somehow i saw him & this white clouded back round but yet you could see the things that are in my room from the angle my bed was & he was all dressed in white like and angel, smiling & laughing i mean i could see my hands reaching out for him its like if he was actually in front of me & I was crying my eyes out cause i couldnt believe that he was actually in great conditions ! & so he told me not to cry anymore & too be happy that no matter what he'll always be their. To be more specific let me say it like he told me "Whatever happens with me, I dont want you crying or sad. I want you to be happy gordi, I'll always be with you; i love you." & then as I reached out to him to give him a hug he turned around walked away and disappeared & thats when I woke up or at least I think i did & I started crying so bad. & I was wondering if he was actually in front of me. So like the day after that I was going to go visit him! finally after I found a ride ! & the day before I get a call that he passed away(10/15/08) & that his heart finally stopped beating or whatver. It sucked so bad I wouldnt stop crying. & yet to this day im not over it.      about 2 weeks after his death his step dad told me that his mom took him off the machines for the money which i completely think is true but hey i wasnt there. but i do got things to prove it, all she wanted was the money. but whatever.      sometime around december i had this dream, where i went to go visit him & like everything was going perfect until all of a sudden someone turns off the breathing machine & hes grasping for air & the more I try to get closer the more harder it gets to take a step forward(its like I take 2 steps forward but i go like 382523897 back) some two big guys were holding me back & I was screaming "manny please dont leave me! please!!" & i was balling tears & then when he finally has no sign of life i get free and i go over to him shaking and crying and i try to connect the machines again. but it didnt work.      & what my family dont know is that i practically cry all the time, I try to believe that hes still with me somehow but trying to accept the fact that hes gone forever makes it so hard.      People say im traumatized with his death, since we were very close but i have no idea.   & sorry for making this so long & so sloppy. I had a very hard time typing this.

I was to get married, to a guy I loved very much, he was my best friend, he was in car accident 3 months before we where to get married. We where together for 7 years, when he asked me to marry him he made me this very beautiful engagement ring, it has 7 generations of the women in his family diamonds in it including my own diamond he bought for me. I want to know what to do with the ring? Give it back to his parents? Or his grandmother? He was the only child, so there is no body else to pass the ring on to. I’ve tried to give it back to his grandmother she told me he gave it to me I should keep it for ever. But I can’t wear it? Can I? It has only been 8 months since he left us.

20090309151902AA8LkC8	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a weird dream can someone please explain it?	Note: i have very vivid dreams so this one will have alot.      In the dream i started off at a party and i was having fun, because me and my guy friends (in the dream) were playing this game on who could beat up everyone first, i kept winning.       At one point during the dream i was going into the house but somehow i slipped, fell and got knocked out. I wake up and my clothes were askew and my first thought was:      "Who raped me?"      I am soon pushed into a car with the guy friends who are oddly fitting in the car 4 on a seat, but they are laughing and making sexual jokes and advances on me, even my best guy friend. (who in the dream was complete opposite of what he is really like)      I kept using my Karate moves to stop them i then grab the door handle to open it and escape by rolling out of the car with my body and my cellphone in hand then i quickly get up and run into the nearest building.       I soon hear that the guys have stopped the car and one of them (a much older guy that i don't/didn't recognise) got out and started to chase after me i was running in this mazelike building and kept screaming for help but people just stared at me. The guy then threatens me with.      "I'll rape you again if you don't stop screaming"      He then looks away from me when i text "Help me i've been raped" to 911. The guy chasing me doesn't notice. I escape him again and fingd myself on the balcony of a theatre. my quick thinking tells me to jump and hide under the seats. So i jump from the top down about 15 rows (seriously) and slide under the seat. Of course the guy appears and starts looking under each of the seats, again without him noticing, i quickly slide under the seat in front of me then another in front of that.       The guy eventually gives up and walks out of the theatre i wait a few moments before i escape my cramped hiding spot and jump off the balcony (notice i'm barely getting hurt when i land) and land in the aisle of the theatre below then i rush up to the stage and find it had mannakins and life size puppets. i hear someone coming and, afraid that it's my rapist i pose myself to act like one of the puppets.      It wasn't my rapist but a group of other people who then noticed me and said.      "She's not one"      So i ran off backstage and found myself in another area but it wasn't a stage i was looking at but a TV screen and on the screen it had a paused picture of me in the middle of running and on the options below it had.       "Next scene" "Last Scene" "First sceen" "Why did they do this?"      I went to press the "why did they do this?" Button when i woke up.            Notes:      *my best guy friend is the sweetest guy who ever lived (not just to me but my other female friends too) i mean i asked him to smack me one day because i did something stupid and instead he kissed my forehead and called it a smack, i laughed.      * i have never had sex and am not planning to for a while.      * I have NEVER been raped.      *It is normal for me to have very vivid dreams, sorry about the length.      *I do know Karate in real life.

20090309173115AA9nUh4	Social Science;Psychology	Homicidal/Suicidal thoughts?	I'm 14 and I have homicidal and sucidal thoughts on a regular basis. When it happens, I don't really have a reason, I just contemplate what would happen if I did, and how easy it would be. I realize how easy it would be and what I have the power to do, even though I don't want to. It scares me that things like suicide and murder can happen so easily. Whenever I think about it I start to worry and panic, and I think im crazy. Once I calm down I feel normal again. I'm an intelligent kid, I love my family, but I'm confused, and I need advice. If I do have a mental illness, what could it be?      PS: Anyone who responds, please be serious. Don't tell me: "See a doctor, psycho" or "Hahaha". Im really concerned :(

Husbands commonly provide the following services to the wife:   Personal bodyguard   Furniture mover   Landscaper   Handyman (whoops, handyperson)   Auto mechanic   Plumber   Pest controller   Child disciplinarian   Financial planner   Tax preparer      (feel free to add to list)      These are all services which the wife, if unmarried, would have to pay cash to receive. Therefore these services indeed have a cash value.

I was inspired by this question: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       If a woman chooses to give up her career and become a full-time mother, that is her choice.  No one said that she had to do it.  Should she be appreciated?  Of course.  But you don't deserve a pat on the back for your own choices.      In the same token, if you're a man that chose to be the breadwinner while your wife runs the house, you don't deserve a pat on the head, either.  You made that choice; deal with it.

20090309181433AAi7s1T	Social Science;Psychology	Ughhh. Life is unfair. Is yours?	Ughhh. More than anything ever I want a cell phone really badly. And I don't want Virgin Mobile, Net 10, or anything like that. I want T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon. It sucks because my parents won't let me get a phone with a contract, and it can't be like $30 a month. I am offering to pay $20 (that's the allowance I get a month), and I asked if they could pay $10, but they won't. I tried getting babysitting/petsitting jobs last summer, but I called people, and they never called me back. I would be waiting by the phone or checking my email every 30 mins. to see if they would ever reply. Never did. There are 5 of us kids altogether. So including my parents, that's 7. We're not rich, but we're not really poor. We're okay.. I hate it that I can't get something that I've been wanting since forever, and all I think about is wanting a phone. Yes, I'm a selfish idiot. Well I see my friends and other people with extremely cool phones, and they don't even know anything about them! I know freaking everything about phones! I'm 13, and I see 6 year olds getting phones!   Ahhhh these are the kinds of things that make me hate my life.   You can hate on me if you want.. but I'll just feel more miserable than I already am.

I've been playing piano for a long time and lately I have been getting frustrated because whenever I go on youtube or go out to other performances, there is always somebody better then me.      I know I should be grateful for what I have, but I feel like the ones who are the best get the most attention, the one's who win get the prizes, and the ones who are number one get the most recognition. It's frustratng and I feel no matter how hard I work, I can never be happy with my progress because I'm not getting the results I want.      I feel embarasseed because I have forgotten some insight on my own issue.      What are some things I should remember when it comes to comparing myself to others and how can I stop becoming frustrated and discouraged knowing that there is always somebody better than me?
20090309181759AAkxP5I	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can anyone help make this dream more clear?	I just had the oddest dream while taking a nap.  I have tried looking up the various symbols in dream dictionaries, but nothing really relates completely and some things I just can't find.      Here we go:      The dream wasn't a very long one, but what I can remember is that it all took place in 'my' apartment.  This apartment had a similar layout as mine now, except there was a bathroom on the edge of the living room and there was a balcony.  The apartment was not decorated to my taste at all and a lot of the furniture was old, mismatched and second-hand.      There were two animals in my dream: a white poodle and a very dark green snake.  The poodle was in the beginning of the dream and I never paid much attention to the poodle in the dream until the end.  So, there is this snake and it's obviously a pet.  I have a play pen in the kitchen area of the apartment and I place it in there while I go to do something in my bedroom.  I hear bouncing (much like a someone jumping on a small trampoline with squeaky springs), I come out to the kitchen and see the snake 'bouncing' to get out of the play pen. I am just amazed, because I have never seen a snake move like that before.  The snake eventually gets out of the play pen and starts moving about the house.  It goes into the hallway where I catch it and then I place it in a very large dog kennel.        I back up towards the bathroom and see the snake struggling to get out of the kennel through the wire door.  The holes in the wire do not seem large enough to allow the snake to get through it, but after some serious struggling (with the same energy used to bounce out of the play pen) the snake gets through and lunges at me as I close the bathroom door.  I am facing the snake the whole time.      After I leave the bathroom I start running through the living room, not sure whether I am trying to catch the snake again or get away from it (there was not a point in the dream where I was actually scared of it)  and I see animal feces everywhere.  It's on the furniture, smeared into the carpet.  I step on it and am disgusted, angry and hurt because it is so hard.  I am assuming this is from the dog, but the dog hasn't been in the above mentioned parts of the dream, nor do I remember much else of it.  I remember thinking, "did the snake eat the dog?"            Then I woke up.      I understand the dog and it's meaning in my dream, but not its excrement.  The meaning of the snake - a python, almost six feet long with about a four inch or so circumference, and a very dark green color.  Menacing, but not threatening.  I did not feel any real fear during the dream.      Any light on this from someone more experience than me would be great!
