Hi,       im having a LOT of trouble with what seems like a basic question. i have been stressing over this for nearly 3 hours now. can anyone help me out? here it is:      Light propagating from water into air is incident on the water surface at the angle of total internal reflection. A plane parallel glass plate is brought into contact with the surface of water.      Will any light be observed as a result of that? Justify your answer by using Snell’s law.         what i have managed is that the light ray coming in at the reflection angle for water - air boundary would not be able to experience total internal reflection at a water - glass boundary, since the refractive index of glass is greater than water.      when the ray travels through the glass and meets the glass - air boundary, total internal reflection is possible since air has a lower refractive index than glass.      but, i am stuck here. i cant find a way to show whether the ray will be totally internally reflected or not. can anyone help me?      thanks.

20090226112437AAIhK1n	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Brain / Body connection question?	Is it possible that our body is nothing more than a vessel to carry our brain?  Everything the body does is in reaction to protect the brain.  Bodily functions clean and oxygenate the blood for the brain.  Our reactions are always to protect the brain.  If we fall do we not extend our arms.  If shot at do we not cover our heads.      Lastly, we can live without most (if not all) body parts except for one.  We can not live without a brain.      So is it possible the BRAIN is the real us and the BODY is nothing more than a house per se.  Which could also explain evolution IMO.  The smarter we get the more evolved we get.  Its like saying the richer someone gets the better the house they build for themselves.

Reactions are faster at a higher temperature because activation energies are lower.   2.) Rates increase with increasing concentration of reactants because there are more collisions between reactant molecules.    3.) At higher temperatures a larger fraction of molecules have enough energy to get over the activation energy barrier.   4.) Catalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction have identical mechanisms.

So my team and I were given the task as a school project to design and build a chemically powered car to carry 1000ml of water 20 ft.  We've come up with 2 ways to possibly do it.  One way is through a chemical reaction that will build pressure to drive the car, and the other is to make a chemical reaction that will produce electricity to drive motors.  I think the electricity way would be easier if we can generate enough to carry the weight.  Another problem we have is how to convert the pressure into driving the car.  The rule that is killing us is we can not expel any liquids on to the floor or anything.  Any help would be much appreciated.

So today I tried to donate blood, I've tried twice before; the first time I was deferred because my pulse was 103 and the second time I was allowed to donate because my pulse was 100. This time, they took my pulse and it was 130! The lady felt my pulse by hand until I had calmed down and then took it again. Once again, it was 130! She called her boss over, who took my pulse by hand and it was 88. How could this have happened? Could my pulse really have shot up about 40 beats? The attendant then took her pulse and it was only 70. What does this all mean?

20090226143834AAT5aGT	Science & Mathematics;Biology	How many different genotypes are possible in this specific scenario?	Human skin color is a polygenic trait, meaning that there are multiple genes that regulate this phenotypic trait. The more dominant alleles an individual has for each of these genes, the darker his or her skin color will be. If skin color is regulated by three genes (for the sake of simplicity), and an individual that is homozygous dominant for all three genes marries and has children with an individual that is homozygous recessive for all three genes, how many different genotypes are possible?      I have been pondering on this question for quite a while but I can't seen to figure out what the answer may be.  The answer choices are 1, 3, 9 and 81.      If possible could someone answer this question and tell me how they got it?      Thanks a lot, really appreciate it!

20090225113303AAfaFhb	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Need help with PDEs wave equation, cauchy problem is involved... question listed below:?	Q1: In deriving the general solution of the wave equation    [u(x,t)=f(x+ct)+g(x-ct)] we have used the fact that the linear wave operator L = (dt)^2 -c^2(dx)^2 is FACTORABLE. (**please note dt represents the partial derivative with respect to t and same with dx but for x) Therefore L can be written as a product of linear first-order operators: L=L1L2.  Using the same idea find the general solutions of the following equations:      a) uxx+ux = uyy + uy   hint: [L1 = dx-dy, L2 = dx +dy +1, the general solution can be written as u(x,y) = Phi(x+y) + e^(-x)Psi(x-y)  or as  u(x,y) = Phi(x+y) +e(-y)h(x-y)]         b)3uxx + 10uxy + 3uyy = 0.   hint: [L1 = 3dx + dy, L2 = dx + 3dy; u(x,y) = Phi(3x-y)+Psi(x-3y)]            c)Solve the Cauchy problem utt - 3uxt - 4uxx = 0   u(x,0) = x^2   ut(x,0) = e^x   Proceed in the same way as when deriving the general solution of the wave equation.      Answer should be: [u(x,t)=x^2 +4t^2 + (e^(x+4t)-e^(x-t))/5]      Help with any of the problems would be amazing, I cannot learn without examples and my book is mostly proofs and there is no solution guide.... If you are very good at PDEs I'm also looking for a tutor so please let me know!!

20090226150956AAKPvLl	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Is quantum mechanics a true desciption of reality or just a stepping stone to something more fundamental?	I was talking about this with my friend at university today (we're both physics undergrads) and was just wondering if anyone had anything to add to the discussion. Let's take an example, if you solve a simple Schrodinger equation for a finite square well you can show that there is a probability that the particle will pass through the walls of the well and out the other side- it quantum tunnels. The probability of it being beyond the wall of the well decays exponentially but never reaches zero so you could argue that the particle could be anywhere in the universe as the distance extends to infinity. The probability of it being so far away is insanely small, but it's still there. My question is that this example is something so counter intuitive that it almost seems ridiculous, and so much that quantum mechanics predicts is like this. I know that it describes things quite well, for example if the particle in the finite well couldn't tunnel then we couldn't have scanning tunnelling microscopes (STM), but do you think that quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory and although the stuff it predicts seems bizarre it is still true. Or do you think that quantum mechanics is a good approximation for now but will lead to a more fundamental theory which describes things better later on?

We have taken delivery of a large amount of industral fridge radiators which need to be cut up. Quite simply the radiators contain two types of metal, copper and aluminium (soft metals). What we are trying to do is find the quickest safest and most importantly the most efficient way of extracting the metals seperately. What we are currently doing is running the radiators down through a bandsaw which then allows the copper pipe within to fall away from the aluminium radiator fins. The problem is, this is a time consuming way of doing the job.      Qn Is there a better more efficient way than a bandsaw, or a better piece of machinery or could we design a piece of kit to do the job. Any   ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

20090226153540AAIyBsJ	Science & Mathematics;Physics	A step-down transformer produces a voltage of 7.0V across the secondary coil when the voltage across  is 140V.?

What voltage appears across the primary coil of this transformer if 140V is applied to the secondary coil?       This one is stumping me.
