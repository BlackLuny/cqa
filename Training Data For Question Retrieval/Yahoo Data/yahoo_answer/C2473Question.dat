How can I create original chord progressions that sound good, and at the same time put melody so that I can play both at the same time?   I always fool around with my guitar, but I can never get to something that sounds as a true song...

20090307184353AAHQCH2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Different fantasy/mythology text types that represent women?	For an english project i need to find six different text types representing women and they need to have an underlying theme. I've chosen to do women in mythology and fantasy, i.e fairies, mermaids, sirens, witches etc.   Can you think of any movies, novels, poems, paintings etc. that would be good to study. I need a text type especially for witches or fairies. I don't care about it being simple or children's story anything would be good. Thanks.
20090307184508AAQLYEv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of the first chapter of my book?	Chapter 1    What You Need To Know          The year is 5752. There is over 7000 different communities. 12 communities take up most of the world which now is 70% land because of a erupting volcano that destroyed most of the world then recreated it. The 12 communities are extremely different. One of my favorite communities is the Wanaka community. There rules are odd and probably the most strange there is. Its like they live in the past yet in the future. The main rules are about marriage. Rule number 1 happens to be “You MUST be married by the age of 20 and not before the age of 15.” In Wanaka if you are a girl your father sells you to your husband. The women have no say what so ever. Some girls try to run away but by doing that they leave behind there friends, family and there life. There are also many consequences if you are caught running away. You are sent to work in a factory and in the factory you work so hard and long that you rarely have time to sleep. When you do fall asleep you are awoke by the cries of terror and pain of other workers. Most of the time when you run away you run away with a man that you fell in love with. Are story begins when 12 year old Alice the daughter of one of the richest men in the community falls in love with Steven the son of a poor pig herder. Her father refuses to sell her to someone poor. Will they run away together or will they stay and never love again and if they do run away will they make it.             its not done yet but what do you think so far      P.S. Im 12 and dislexic so dont say anything about my spelling or grammer because im still working on it

20090307184505AA8Gi9u	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing with Personality?	So here's the deal, my writing used to be only personality and the story barely moving forward; now its only story moving forward with no personality. Can you guys give me a hand?       “Hazel!” The distinguishable voice of my best friend Carmen rang through the hallway. I rolled my eyes as I turned and placed myself against the wall to wait for my Amazon friend and avoid getting stuck in the stream of people. Carmen shoved through a group people getting a, “b----,” remark from them. I shook my head as I watched her approach. Carmen could easily get away with stuff like that considering she’s a giant that could play in the WNBA. If I did that I would be squished considering I’m the height of an eighth grader when I’m a sophomore.     “Why didn’t you wait for me?” She asked as we continued down the hallway. I shrugged my shoulders as we turned into another hallway.    “Well, you were still writing everything down and you had basically every single item in your backpack on your desk. I didn’t exactly feel like waiting.” I said chuckling. Carmen let out a frustrated humph at my response.     “Sorry I needed all my stuff.” She said playing defensive. I hung my jaw slightly as I gave her a “you gotta be kidding me” look.     “I don’t think you needed your protractor for history.” I said as we entered the cafeteria. She opened her mouth to protest but then she closed it and continued forward. “Ha-ha, victory.” I cheered doing spirit fingers.     “So, you’ve trained the midget to dance, huh Carmen?” I pursed my lips and clenched my fists to my sides as my eye turned to into slits when the unmistakable voice of my sworn enemy came from behind us. I turned to give him a piece of my mind but Carmen stopped me.    “Ignore him,” She whispered to me as she turned me around, “you’ll only be giving him satisfaction if you respond.” She said pushing me forward to our usual table.    “It obeys orders too.” The voice of Satan’s son mocked from behind us. I let out a harsh huff before I continued forward with Carmen, adjusting my backpack straps as we did so.     “Leave her alone Derek.” Carmen said turning to Derek. I was so tempted to turn around and cause a scene but I’m bigger then that so I continued forward.         See any personality opportunities?

20090307191309AAeaLyj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this scene from my story?	I ran up stairs to my room and slammed my bedroom door shut. I threw myself on my bed and closed my eyes, trying to block out everything in my mind that kept coming back to me. My mother just got done yelling at me again. This wasn’t the first time she always comes home drunk. But why does it still bother me as if it was the first time all over again. She came through the front door stumbling around and finally sat down on the side of the couch. I was in the kitchen eating dinner that I fixed for myself, like I did everyday.       I walked into the living room and saw my mother. Her curly red hair was a mess with her eye liner and mascara all smeared under her eyes. Her clothes where skin tight, she had on a black tank top and a pair of tight blue jeans that were tucked inside her black boots that went up to her knees. She still had a beer bottle in her hand, she took a big drink of it and sat it down on the coffee table and looked up at me.       “What?!” she said pushing her hair back.       “I didn’t say anything.” I went to the coffee table and grabbed her beer bottle.       “Give me that!” She said yelling getting up and following me as I made my way into the kitchen.       “No! I’m sick and tired of you coming in here every day drunk as hell!” I said and threw the beer bottle in to the trash.       I turned my head and she slapped me across the face. I backed up and ran to the other side of the kitchen table. I put my hand up to the side of my face and felt the hot skin of where she just hit me.       “Damn you Alicia!” She yelled and opened the refrigerator and pulled out her pack of bud light.       She opened up a can and took a drink and started her way of the stairs to her bedroom.       “Some of my friends are coming over this weekend and I don’t want you here to ruin it. So you need to go somewhere. I don’t care where just not here.” She said to me, as I heard her bedroom door shut.       That’s when I ran to my room and started crying. I remembered it again and again, but I told myself to stop that I wouldn’t let my mother get the best of me. So, she was having some of her friends over at the house.       I laughed to myself, and thought of all the friends she has had at the house before and how they had left the house a mess, and I had to clean it up. I heard the phone ring, so I rolled over on my side and reached over and grabbed the phone and answered it, “Hello?”       “Hey Alicia! What you been up too?” Savanna said, on the other end, she sounded so enthused about something, but then I remembered I know Savanna all my life and never once has she bored me.       She had been my best friend since Pre School, I remember asking her if I could barrow her crayons because I didn’t have any and ever since then you could say that we have been sisters.       “Nothing, just eating dinner. What about you?” I said sitting up and slinging my legs over the side of my bed. I just couldn’t tell her anything about my mother, I just couldn’t. It was too embarrassing.       “Well, you’re so going to love this.”       “Love what?” I was so confused; she knew how I hated not knowing what was going on.       “Party, Friday night, my house.”       “Party?” I asked still confused, why on earth was she throwing a party?       I heard her sigh as if she didn’t want to go threw all the details but she did anyways, “Well my dad is out of town for the weekend, something about a business trip and hey! Trace talked me into it.”       I smiled to myself, I should have known. Ever since Trace has walked into Savanna’s life, she has turned into a rebel you might as well say. I hated Trace with a passion; he was just so rude and not good for Savanna. But I kept my thoughts to my self of course and allowed my only friend to go out with him.       “Okay, so who’s all going to be there?” I asked, I was kind of curios about it. But I wouldn’t admit that to Savanna.       “Everyone!” She said at a high pitch screamed, “Our whole class, and the grade below us. Some people are saying that this is going to be the party of the year. And since we are officially seniors, don’t you think we can party some?”       “Well won’t that be nice to be seniors who party.” I said sarcastically.       “Come on, I thought you would love this idea.”       “I guess, anyways, my mom’s having a party all weekend here, so there should be no problem with me not being able to come over.” I said, thinking back to what my mother had said to me.       I heard savanna laugh and say, “And I bet there will be a lot of cute guys here, all you will have to do is take your pick.”       I laughed and said, “Yeah, like some guy would ever be interested in me.”       “You never know. Well hey got to go. I’m going to call up some more people and tell them. Talk to you later okay Alicia?”       “Alright, bye Savanna.” I said and hung up the phone and fell across my bed.

Its new and not done tell me what you think?	“Mom” I complained, she had been hugging and kissing me all the way to the bus stop.    “I’ll be fine; I know where I’m going. How lost can I get?” My mom ignored me. “I’m sorry Emili. You know how worried I get.” My mom was extremely over protective. She makes me call her when I get to school, and school is only 15 minutes away even when I’m walking.    “Mom we’ll be fine.” Bree tried to tell her. Bree is my goody-goody older sister. She is a suck-up. “Do you girls know where you’re going?” Mom asked us for the millionth time.    “Yes” we reply simultaneously. Bree was going off to collage and I was going on the summer trip of a lifetime. I remember when my parents had told me about my trip. It was on my birthday, I had just turned 13.    “Look” my mom said as she pulled out the secret present. My parents hid a gift every year and always “forget” to give it to me. I ripped of the paper and screamed.    “You mean I’m going on a three month tour of Europe?” I had asked still amazed. That night I went online to check it out. I was going on a European co-ed tour with about 50 or 60 other kids my age.    “Do you have everything you need?” my mom asked once again.    “Yes” we both replied.    “There’s my bus.” I told my mom “I’ve got to go. I love you I will call you and e-mail you whatever chance I get” I told my parents.

20090307193358AAq2h8Z	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think this is a good start for a story?	I am writing this story and want to know your opinion.        Avery Hamilton was a very bright, mischievous girl. Amy Hamilton, on the other hand, was extremely responsible, and an unmistakable hard-working sister. Both had many differences that caused occasional bickering between the two thirteen-year old girls. But it was their similarities that brought them together with an unbreakable bond that will last forever even into womanhood.      They were really popular at their school, Ridgeway Middle School and participated in many after-school clubs or sports teams.    Even with their twin like appearances everyone saw that Avery was clearly the beautiful one. Every time she walked by, everyone looked at her. Her flowing blonde hair, her deep, mesmerizing gray eyes, and her gentle smile. She never noticed her true beauty though. Amy, was also quite pretty, had long, blonde, silky hair with fading highlights. Her eyes were also a kind of a storm-cloud sort of color but her mother said they had a green tint in them just like her grandmother.   Avery loved soccer more than anything else in the world. She is an exceptional player and has won many medals and trophies. Amy has a different interest at heart. She loves karate. She has also won awards for her perfect performances. Their parents are immensely proud of their accomplishments.     They both slept in the same room, right next door to their brother James, fondly called Jim, by his loyal friends. He was heading of for college in a few days and he was busy packing. He was intelligent and was going to an expensive college. But he was accepted to go to Garamond College with a full scholarship.   Jim could be found reading curled up on the couch, slowly sipping some iced tea, instead of actually enjoying himself at the pool in the backyard. He just doesn’t know how to enjoy himself.     Avery knocked on his door one evening when the weather was really hot and humid, and with air conditioners put on high. But of course there was no answer, as Avery expected, so she had to switch to a different strategy.    “You could have knocked,” said nineteen year old Jim angrily. He was obviously not amused by the lock-picking trick that Avery had used to enter his room.   “I did, Jim,” exclaimed Avery.  “Like really loud, so I thought you weren’t in the room”.   “Oh really, so what were you going to do when you got into my room?”   “I was just gonna borrow some money-”   “What!”   “I was going to pay you back-”   “Get out of my room!”   “But-”    “Now!” yelled Jim furiously.      Avery left the room stepping over unpacked items that were scattered all over the floor, and slammed the door in complete enragement. She just wanted to buy a soda at the drugstore across the street, but apparently she was broke. She decided she would ask her mom for some money after she calmed down.     She went along the hallway with angel wallpaper, which she really liked, down the stairs, and into the kitchen. Her mom wasn’t there. The only person there was Amy. She was making a sandwich.     “Have you seen Mom anywhere?” asked Avery curiously.   “Why? Need more money again?”   “Yes,” said Avery staring down at her shoes.
20090307200132AAokgqW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this writing?	RUBY      I didn’t give a thought anymore about what would affect my chances of making it into heaven. I no longer had a doubt in my mind that witches could not go to heaven. As a result, I no longer cared how many sins I committed. I felt the animal become lifeless in my deadly gripping hands. I smiled to myself. Another challenge conquered. I thrust the dead body off my lap and stood up, smoothing my jeans. They were torn, like my T-shirt and covered in dirt. I picked a number of leaves and twigs out of my long golden hair. I felt it swinging against my back as I made my way over to a small lake a few metres away.    I leaned over it and took a swig of water. I loved living so wildly and surviving off everything nature had to offer. Sure, a big bowl of pasta would’ve been nice once in a while, but I dealt with what I could find on the land. Plants, fresh fruit, animals. It was how I was supposed to live – I was following my destiny. I had never wanted to be a monster. I didn’t get a choice. I was a witch despite what I would have chosen if I’d had a choice. That didn’t matter though. Monster or not, I was good at living how I did. I never felt guilty . . . why should I? That was how I was created I was designed as a predator. I gulped down the cold water of the lake, liking how it felt running down my throat. I then sat up and looked at my reflection in the water. I waited for the smooth ripples on the surface to calm before I assessed my appearance.  I smirked at myself. I looked exactly the same as I had around fifty years before. Never changing, never aging – one of my favourite perks of immortality. I remembered the first time I had seen my reflection after my transformation had completed itself.    When my father had informed me that I, like my mother before me, had become a witch, I was shocked. I immediately thought of green skin, knotted black hair and warts. I had never seen my mother. She had run away after having me and left me at the doorstep of my father’s house with a note. So I had never learnt about the amazing beauty that came with the transformation. I had looked into my bedroom mirror reluctantly, not wanting to see that damage that I was sure had occurred to my face. I was shocked to see that I was nothing like I’d imagined. I had long golden blonde hair that waved down to the centre of my back and skin so pale it could be considered translucent. Most startling were my mesmerising green eyes. I had stared at them for a long time wondering where my past blue eyes had gone. Then I had smiled. I was the most stunning thing I had ever seen. I had run away from home like my mother that day. I couldn’t stay with my father – he wouldn’t want that either. He never came looking for me and I never went back.       I touched the water of the lake, creating new texture on the surface of the water. I then held a pale finger to the tiny star shaped birthmark on my palm. I was sure every witch had one. As long as you had that mark, you couldn’t deny the future you were meant to have. For a brief moment my thoughts flickered to my cousin, Annabelle, and her mother, Lyn. They had chosen to give up everything supernatural introduced into their lives. They didn’t use their gifts and tried to disguise their beauty. They felt burdened by it. They          wanted to be human. I wrinkled my nose at the word, as I would have if it had been spoken out loud. I didn’t understand their decision. No matter what they thought, they couldn’t change who they were. It was unnatural for them to try to blend in like they did.          **** I apologise for length,,   ************* PLEASE PLEASE no comments on the twilight series and comparing them or saying they are similar, ive already had one comment like that and explained yes, i realise they are similar at the moment but i am only a teenager wondering what people think of her writing and this is only a small section of it. the rest of the book makes a lot of differences between twilight and this VERY clear.      thankyou and b kind, im only a teen ;) ???

In truth, he was a drunk and a womaniser who fathered a dozen children (not all to the same woman) yet to the Scots, he's a God!      So, why don't the English hold J R R Tolkien nights in honour of one of our most renowned literary genius's. And as far as I know, was an honest and honourable man. Tolkien helped to write the dictionary for God's sake so he definitely deserves our recognition!       What do you think?

20090227095247AA4WTvY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A love triangle, of a sort, what should I do?	I was travelling on business. And stopped at Cesena, in a hotel, and met that delightful delightful woman, Rosine,  full figured, raven dark hair, moon-like face. I called her "my beauty mark". I fell in love and we went shopping for clothes with her. Then, I went back to the hotel and to sleep, to be awaken by a young and pretty man in military uniform (hussar). He could not explain what he was doing here, played games with me, hinted on something, introduced himself as Henry. By and by this Henry admitted to me that he was, in fact, a young woman, Henriette, in man's clothes. She was curious about me, and wanted to see me closer, and came to my hotel room at night (I am rather famous at my part of the world). Then an older man arrived, a military captain, appeared to be her boyfriend. To cut it short, she dumped her boyfriend and is now staying with me. I am in love with her, I am deeply in love! The problem is, people from fashion boutique arrived, with Rosine's clothes, just as Henriette and I were getting on so well. I tried to pretend that I bought them for her, but the silly woman - a boutique owner - talked too much, and said that this was a different signora - slimmer, and a blond, and the clothes wouldn't suit. I am afraid that Henriette will go mad at me and will dump me. It does look a little flippant, to be in love with one woman today and with another - the next day, but it's just happened! What should I do?

20090307201205AAbjQZK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Anyone who has read The Time Traveller's Wife and has the book?	Ok so I have a few questions concerning the book, starting with:      On page 376 at the top of the page, it says 'He's a CDP.' If Henry is talking about Alba, shouln't it be 'She's a CDP?'      Also on page 431, the beginning of the chapter entitled 'The episode og the Monroe Street Parking Garage', why is there no little spiral sign under the chapter heading like the rest? It's just that the book is so perfect I doubt it's a mistake - it seems it was done purposely, but I don't know why.      Plus, what is the point of Ingrid's character? I liked her, but I didn't understand why she was put in the story only to die in the end. And what was the significance of the last scene where she committed suicide and Henry was there? It's the first time we find out that Ingrid knew Henry was a time traveller, but what else?      Furthermore, on page 452, Henry says 'Somewhere out there I am dying.'  I didn't really understand that because I thought there was only one of him there, so how is he able to look at the patch of blood and refer to himself as being elsewhere?      Also when Henry bought the lottery ticket with the winning numbers, Clare said something like they could win the lottery everyday if they wanted to. But how can that be if, according to Henry, the future cannot be changed and in the future they never win the lottery?      And the situation with Gomez - what exactly was his relationship with Clare? So basically he loved her for most of his life but she loved Henry, so he marries Charisse who actually loved him. Is that it? So did Gomez actually love Charisse but just loved Clare more? Where does Charisse stand in all this?      And, one other thing, Clare's pregnacy - how was she able to get pregnant after all those miscarriages? What was different about that time?      Phew, finally got them all down. I apologise if some of these questions are really stupid, but in my defence I've read and reread the book and I still don't understand some parts of it. Sorry if I missed anything But if anyone can clear these questions up, I would be really grateful
20090227101401AAIkvKl	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Any comments on this poem?	10 lines for light.         A pepper of blackbirds spice the sky,   there is a slow moment you can taste, a time   you inhale and feel the chiming city sigh.      Red Housebricks sing, mad in the sun,   wires of copper light entwine a pregnant treeline.      There is rhyme.  The poetry of faces at noon      on the streets: light and airy, rhythmic   and sweet or blank and unknowable, cold and dark   like the sea, breaking shore in waves of rhetoric      as a white flower of breath opens and rises.  Dies.

20090227105734AApiQ7a	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	"What can I offer Her"?	All of my life I dreamed of meeting one   with immense beauty, and once I found her   I would charm her and she'd be mine forever      I have found her and indeed she is all   I wished for and more but she is   not charmed nor intrigued. Then I   think to myself "What can I offer her?"   The tears warm my eyes and blur my   vision. I stick to my stance of bravado   and give her the same uninterested look   she gave me. She was so beautiful   But what can I offer her.      -Tupac Shakur

Meaning Edward changed Bella into a vampire by biting her she turned into a vampire. But when vampires such as the newborns bite someone they automatically die but don't become vampires.       2. Edward said that Bella's blood was Irresistible? Is that because she had her period. That the smell was so rich : D      Weird questions I know but what's your opinion.

20090307203050AAT6M2G	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Adalie and the Mirror of Aleaid (chapter one looking for harsh criticism)?	Adalie woke to the sound of rain dripping into large metal buckets. The roof of her house had many missing shingles and when it rained it often leaked. It didn’t help that her house was on the edge of a rather dismal lake, which seemed to make it rain heavier there than anywhere else. The dripping of the rain was pleasant tho, and although her nose was cold, the rest of her body was warm and toasty under her heavy quilt, and she wished she could sleep just a little bit longer. Sighing, she kicked off her covers and ran to empty the buckets. There were chores to be done, and on top of that she didn’t want her bedroom to flood and give her any more work to do. With that done she pulled on her heavy galoshes, threw on her raincoat and went to milk Nanny.      It was cold outside and windy. The fog rolling around the lake enveloped her house and made it hard to see. Luckily she didn’t need to go very far. Adalie ran into the lean-to and slammed the door. “We really should make an entrance from the house,” thought Adalie as she grabbed a handful of alfalfa. “M-e-e-e-h,” Adalie bleated very much like a goat. The snowy white goat trotted to her outstretched palm and started crunching. Adalie pulled up her stool and bucket and milked her. Then she raked the floor and added clean wheat straw. She checked the chicken coop for eggs and found three which she promptly stuck into her pockets. She patted the goat between the horns, then picked up the milk bucket and headed back to the house.   “How many eggs did you get?” asked her father as she came into the house.   “Three, one for each of us,” she replied.   Her father was a tall man. He had a shock of black hair over a weathered and stern face, his voice was gruff, and his eyes sad but he treated his girls very kindly. Everyday he tended the neighbors many goats. Once he had had as many, maybe even more, but much time has passed since then and now he only owns the one she goat. That goat gave them milk and cheese. Their few hens provided breakfast. “Perhaps I should buy another hen,” he suggested.   “We cant afford it,” replied Kader. “Besides, 3 eggs is plenty enough for us.”   Her sister, Kader was almost 17, more than five whole years older than she was. Kader was tall and beautiful in a way that Adalie was not. Where Adalie was tall and thin, Kader had round soft curves. Her hair was the color of warm honey and not the drab dark color the rest of the family had. Since their mother passed away it was she who ran the house. She alone made sure the house was clean, that there was food to eat, and that Adalie behaved. Already the floors were swept, the stove blazing hot and water heating up for the midday stew. Coffee was already steaming in three mugs. Now she took the eggs away from Adalie and proceeded to cook them. Kader scrambled them up with the rich goat milk and added cheese and chunks of onion and peppers. She divided it among the 3 of them giving their father the bigger portion. Along with the eggs they each had a hunk of bread, that although a little stale, was just fine toasted a bit and dunked in the dark sweet coffee.   “mmmmm,” mumbled Adalie.   “Delicious omelet Kader,” said her father as he stood up and put his cap on. Rain or shine the goats always needed tending. Rapid knocking came from the front door. Her father opened it and there stood Landric the neighbor’s son.   “The goats have got loose, Bill, he exclaimed. “It seems the storm broke a section of the fence and they have all wandered off.”   “I’m off to work girls,” he said.   “Bye Pa,” mumbled Adalie her mouth full of food.   Kader helped her father with his coat all the while shyly sneaking peeks at the young man who had arrived for her father.   “Good morning Kader,” said Landric. “Are you well?”   “Yes, thank you, Good morning,” she blushed.   He wished Adalie a fine day as well then he and their pa headed off to the pastures.   Adalie put all the dishes in the sink to be washed. “How can you like him?” said Adalie as she scrubbed. “He’s stiff and boring, plus his ears stick out.”   Kader laughed. “He is sweet, and honest, and works hard,” she replied. “Plus he has a cute rear,” She was promptly wacked on the head by the dish towel.

I have checked it over a few times but it may still have spelling or grammar mistake sorry... thank you in advance, the most thoughtful answer gets 10 points.      The vent was open. From it came soiled air that had no scent. The men in the chamber had on masks however and could only breath purified oxygen. It was pure and richly filled their lungs.       These men were coal miners. They were each outfitted with a thick suit powerful enough to protect them from the flames. For these miners did not use picks or drills. Decades of research had placed fire in their hands.       A man named Done came to the end of the tunnel, before his group of workers and told them to step back. It didn’t matter since they too wore suits, but he preferred the room. He lifted the weapon, not tool, for this is what he felt of it, and touched the buttons as naturally as if he took a breath.       White fire leapt from the gullet of the machine and sprayed light against the men. Their suits were a brilliant red with black designs that ran across their bodies. The helmets made them all seem like creatures.       Done released the button and looked at his work. In the place of a wall of rock was now a long tunnel. It opened grandly and sunk in to the center. He had enough room to walk a few meters before he once again primed the weapon. This is what Done did, day and night. He worked on two eight hour shifts, for the tanks needed to be filled with oxygen every nine hours. He would call the flame to clear a tunnel, walk as he made it larger, and would do this until the end of his shift. He didn’t know where he would go next. Sometimes he would turn or stop and double back to make another hole somewhere on the side.       It was men behind him that would dictate where he went. These were the men that held instruments capable of finding coal. These were the men he relied on day after day to keep him safe. Some carried devices that set up framework and light. One of the men carried their lunch and liquids. Another held a survival kit.       He sighed, no sound came from his mask, only the rhythmic churn of recycled air against the filter. Done wondered when he could leave and then pressed the button once more. He didn’t decided when he left.       He turned over his shoulder. The men, his men, seemed like faceless animals. Hunched in loose suits with thick folds. The masks they wore with  devoid of any feature. Inhuman eyes and a coiled tube that lead from their mouths to a rack of tubes against their hips. They’re not even human, he told himself. He imagined what it would be like to turn the flames against them. Watch as they burnt and their ashes fell. Would they cry in alien tongue? Or would they yell like men? This is what Done constantly thought during the burn.       “It is,” a voice came from next to him. He shuddered to snap the flame off. His men watched him though none spoke up.       Would they stand there waiting for him? Which one had spoken?       Done realized he didn’t even know their names. He had always come down here. Traveled by foot and by tram. Side by side next to these men. Not even once had he asked for their names. Not once had he even bothered. Faceless. They were faceless, but worse, they had no names.

20090307202638AAokhZ2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good start to my book? Looking for A LOT of constructive criticism...?	Fire can be warm and comforting, creating heat and a beautiful glow. Something everyone has come to appreciate. Yet, fire can also be dangerous and lethal, racing and leaping gracefully but greedily to consume all in its path, leaving nothing but death and destruction. The power to control, and then to abuse. To love, and destroy with powerful flames all lies in your hands.      Chapter One: Pain Killer         "Adriana! Get up!"  My step-mothers shrill voice pierced my ears.  I was really starting to detest my name.  Each time she called it sent jagged daggers to my ears and skin.     I lie awake, too warm and comfortable to get out of bed.  My fluffy, robin egg blue duvet pulled over my head creating an exact replica of a lightless night.      I herd each sharp tap of her high heels as she climb the grand stair case and head to my room.  Before I counted to ten, my door smashed against my wall and my step-mother was, obviously, furiously irritated by my laziness and reluctance to get out of bed.     Another successful day, she was pissed.       "Have I been talking to myself! I said get up!" I could hear the stress in her voice.     She'd been downstairs, calling for me to get up at least eight times.  And before that, she had come in my room twice, poking me with her sharp, long nails, telling me it was seven thirty.     She started it, poking me, almost as if she were a kid, poking a dead animal with a sharp stick.  Only she was more repulsed.     To me, this seemed to be a suitable punishment: a raspy, exerted voice and a bad start to her day.  It’s not that the poking hurt,—not that much could really be called pain in my eyes anymore—it was just a way to get her back.  I didn't care if she liked me or not, but she didn’t have to treat me like an animal.  No, wait, worse then just any animal.  I was, in her eyes, more like a rat . . . or a cockroach.      "AH!"  I gasped as the cold autumn air stung my body, shocking me awake.  "What the hell do you think your doing?"  I grabbed my duvet from her manicured talons and pulled it over my body, giving her the dirtiest look I could conjure up at this time of day.      She tugged on my blanket.  "I'm telling you right now, you—”  She didn’t bother calling me names anymore.  Her and I both knew there was no point.  It would just get us started . . . again.       “If you don’t get up right now, I swear I will drag you out of that bed by your hair!"  By the end of her threat, she was shrilly whispering.     Threats really never bothered me, because I knew they were empty.  She would never fallow through with anything she hadthreatenedd.  Partly because she knows what I would do to her if she did, and partly because she didn't want to break any of her pretty little nails.  I usually just ignored her, but I did have to go to school. . . .     Her hazel eyes practically willed me to drop dead.  The feeling of triumph trickled through the cold numbness that had taken over once I'd given up, and that now, was eternally present in my mind.     I stretched and cracked my knuckles—knowing how much she hated that.   I could see her flinch—blurrily—from the corner of my eye.  Yawning and rubbing my eyes, I tried to stretch out the process as long as possible.      Arms crossed, foot tapping impatiently, scow on her face, she watched and waited helplessly.       "You could go now."  I added smoothly, snickering under my breath.  She stormed out of my room, slamming the door behind her.  I was surprised her thin, strappy stiletto heels hadn't snapped in half.     Getting up, I stumbled my way towards the big, white stereo that was set upon a glass shelf.  In bright blue neon, it read eight fifteen.  Ten minutes 'till school. I drummed my fingers on the smooth, immaculate plastic.  I would make it on time. I'd just have to rush a bit. . . .     Quickly grabbing my tooth brush, tooth paste I stuck them in the shower, along with my face wash then rushed over to the cuppord to get towels.  My hair was messy, wild.  I carefully took out the rubber band holding my six shades of natural, golden blond hair in a messy bun and pulled it onto my wrist.  My long hair bounced limply to the upper middle of my back.  A shame I needed a shower, the locks in my hair were quite pretty.  I sighed as I climbed in.  The hot water gave me goose bumps, but it was really nice on my deadly cold skin.      I held my eye open and stuck my contact in.  My eyesight was terrible.  Without contacts, everything appeared as if I was looking through haze.   The contrast between my eyes now made me dizzy.  I suck the other one in and looked at myself in the mirror.     My lilac, purple eyes stared back at me lifelessly.  The purple was so dull it almost looked white.  My face drained of colour and my lips looked too pail.  It was odd that I looked pale.  The olive skin tone I had all year round had gone.  I was now, a boring shade of chalky, sick looking gold.      I opened the half empty, burgundy bottle of anti-depressants and p
20090307202816AAXI2Au	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A 10 year old boy wrote this beautiful poem called patterns?	How often   when the jingle of thoughts   here cross the great divide   that is of you and me   Little spaces   incomplete turns   that both rebel and yet   When the song is right   harmonizes so well   That we forget the differences.      Many the dreams that rattle   within our battle   of being   that we cannot negotiate a path   that runs finely   Timely   to the set patterns that are our lives.      But I remember   Know well   the inside out of you   The little glimpses that once were   are yet   and swerve to the marvel   of each image you portray   Somewhere despite the vast   boundaries   that ride along side our dreams   I still know my sister.

20090307203703AAuoXtc	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Is this name Dutch or something else?	I do a lot of research on my family. My grandfather had always told me that he was half German and half English. But as I was looking through my family tree i noticed that his grandmothers name was different. It was Ola Jane Van Neman. I looked up Van and they said that it doesn't exist in the German language, and it certainly isn't English. But it was Dutch. Then he said that he thought she was Dutch and was born in the Netherlands. But his family doesn't keep records so I do all the geneology myself. What do you think, is it Dutch, German, or I was also thinking Polish, if they have Van in the Polish language? Of course he is still both German and English by his other grandparents.

20090307205353AAOoWAe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What would be some good books for me to read? (Please read details)?	First off, NO TWILIGHT, PLEASE.      Now that that's out of the way, down to Business.      I like books that make you think, or are interesting all the way through.      I don't like a lot of romance, because many authors over-do it, and it gets old.       Political themes aren't bad, like Brave New World, or Animal Farm.       I especially like books that have to do with society, like A Clockwork Orange.       Also, memoirs. (Only if they are interesting enough, like Running With Scissors.)      Greek and Roman mythology is cool, also. I really enjoyed reading The Odyssey.      Some other authors I have enjoyed: Chuck Palahniuk, Stephen King, Jodi Picoult, Lewis Carol, Edgar Allen Poe, and many more whose names I can't remember.

In every heart there is a god of flowers, just waiting   to stride out of a cloud and lift its wings.   The kookaburras, pressed against the edge of their cage,   asked me to open the door.   Years later I remember how I didn't do it,   how instead I walked away.   They had the brown eyes of soft-hearted dogs.   They didn't want to do anything so extraordinary, only to fly   home to their river.   By now I suppose the great darkness has covered them.   As for myself, I am not yet a god of even the palest flowers.   Nothing else has changed either.   Someone tosses their white bones to the dung-heap.   The sun shines on the latch of their cage.   I lie in the dark, my heart pounding.

Two of the characters in the play were acted by the opposite sex: the mother was a man and the young boy was played by a female. What's the purpose of this?       Is it simply to add humor?      Or is it to illustrate the implausibility of gender stereotypes our society has created?      I understand it may be hard to say without seeing the play, but i am still curious.

Beams of light caress my soul, but I am not enlightened,    Would you like to sing my song….I beg you…      Carefree, mind numbing bliss, what’s your path?   I have no rejoice in your way   Something sings to my heart, with such bitter irony,   I think it’s something I’ll have to face one day….      Softly strumming words of wise   And still the dark cloak blinds my eyes   Can no breath truly satisfy?   Can you break through the disguise?      And the sun it sets, but beyond the light there’s hope in night   A thousand souls converge and lift and sing and start the night anew   A song is sung and words are spoken and still I find myself in you   A soul can walk, a soul can run but a ones soul can’t ever outrun the sun….               .

I do an ok job hiding them before I perform but I get all shakey whenever I mess up even a little bit. If you play trumpet you know that it is a little hard to keep a good tone when you are scared that you are going to drop your trumpet. This especially effects the way I perform on my solos. If you could give me some good hints on how to keep my nerves to a minimum I would greatly appreciate it.

20090307201750AAyEoZK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this any good? I have written it.?	I am 11 and love writing do you think it is any good? it is about the Anzacs and a soldier who's life and family was destroyed by war      The soldier looked at the telegram in dismay. His face turned cold, his eyes becoming nothing more than slits. You could see the grief wash over him, this wasn’t supposed to happen. He was supposed to come home as a survivor. He would never be able to be happy, he couldn’t live with this horrible truth. It was as if someone had stabbed his heart but instead of him dying a fast death this was a slow and painful. Soon his feeling of sympathy towards himself departed, he was angry, he wanted vengeance. He grabbed his rifle and pushed himself to climb up the trench walls. There was a dead silence, it probably was more scary than the sounds of the firing guns.        The captain had his back turned towards the soldier, but as soon as he heard the noise of footsteps climbing up the ladder, he turned around. The captain rushed towards the soldier and tugged at the soldier’s shirt, pulling the soldier down. The soldier turned around, a murderous look on his face. In one swift movement the soldier punched the captain and pulled himself out of the trench. He raced to the front line pointed the gun at the first person he saw and shot. The battle had begun.

Uhh, if you have any time on your hands, can anyone please read this to see if it's any good or if I'm just wasting my time. Thanks.      Lies.I should be used to them by now.So why be honest to the world when you're not getting anything in return? I found out there's no use in that with experience.How it started; that I don't remember quite well. But now I find myself here, lost with no words to describe the agony that's raging within me. I look around at my surroundings for the first time since I stepped out the cab. I hadn't took notice of the gaudy bungalow styled home that stood before me.Its' two story windows gazed at me inimically as if to say 'Go away!'I let loose the knot on my messenger bag and dug inside, grabbing a small folded piece of paper and reading it quietly.Yup, this was it.My new 'home', as my mom called it a few days ago.The houses' peachy-yellow color was almost intimidating.The broken steps awaited for their next victim. It was not how I interpreted it years ago when I would come visit each summer and play with the boys.I had fun here and always wanted to go back.That night, almost ten years ago, I had made a wish that I wanted to come back and visit, not giving it any real thought. But now I regretted it for I wasn't here to play hide and seek with my cousins; I was here because I was forced to, from my beloved parents.It had seemed that they were the only ones that cared for me, but that was before any of this happened.I mean, I love my aunt and cousins and miss them, but I wanted to be home, my real home. Where my friends are.Where everything I know is. I took a step forward but quickly stepped back as I saw a shadow emerge from the side of the house. The figure was sort of limping his way over to me. No longer in the shade, his face came into view. He was of tan complexion and his wrinkles looked as if they were stuck there. It appeared as if he hadn't touched a razor in years. His hair hung awkwardly on his head, a shade of gray. I looked for a smile in his eyes, but found none and turned my gaze away. He stopped a few feet in front of me and stared at me with mischievous  glare in his eyes. I shrunk back, feeling uneasy in the presence of this strange man.      I know it's a bit long, so you don't have to read it if you don't feel like it.

I havn't really come up with a name for this one yett butt :      Our lives seem to fall so fast   It seems like we have no time to say goodbye to the past   We all feel like no one cares   While receiving the demeaning stares..   No one can hear the screaming inside   is there anyway to make is subside   while we long for it to go away   we pray so hard for a better day      When that day finally comes   we are more then willing to come out of the slums   now that are lives are so great   we are having fun all day and staying up late   We finally found the one that cares   we no longer care about the stares   We constantly remind them of how much they are needed   and that iwth out them we would have been defeated   It would kill us to see them go   So we remind them that we love them so   With them are lives feel so complete   when we think about them our heart seems to skip a beat            Heres the next one:      More and more, every day      seem to take, thier lives away      Boys are girls of every age      all have lives that are oh so strange      A qucik cut, down the wirst      will send them to a cloudy mist      As days go by, more and more go      what made them do it we may know      The familys all cry in pain      because the child cut down the vein

20090307223331AAiCc2n	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem I composed?	As I look into your eyes       I start to think back      Over that very precious day we met.      The sweetness of your voice;      A beautiful tone;      I know its something that I'll never forget.      And I don't know how to thank you more.      I wish I was better skilled at that.      But any hour of the day I spent with you      Is time lost that I will never regret.      I remember back when I had lived in the desert      And I came across a thirsting cat.      lifted him him up and gave him some water      And on his head I gave a gentle pet.      Desperate cat so caught under the heat      And no one had come to save him yet.      This is the way you've came into my life      So in my eyes you will always be the best..      The End      Now are you ready for you chocolate and blueberry Muffins?
20090307222135AAwsZFe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you keep on reading?	Prologue      The Beginning          It was hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, but too hot for anybody to stay and watch. Everyone stayed in the cool comfort of their homes. Listless branches hung to the ground  too tired to dance with the wind. Even the wind was exhausted, too worn out to even cool the heat, it just pushed the hot air around. It was the kind of day in which one should sit directly in front of a fan, or better yet an air conditioner, with a book and some ice cold lemonade. Definitely not a day for strenuous activity. Most definitely not a day for running, unless of course you wished to pass out from heat exertion.       The girl ran but she was tired and hot. Sweat matted her curls down and the effort had made her round cheeks red and her breath come out in rasping gasps. She had come such a long way already, at a pace that suggested her life depended on it, which it very well did. The Torments were fast approaching.       Torments were ugly and malicious little creatures. Their ears were almost as big as they were, and hairy to boot. They had skinny knobby bodies covered in patches of long smelly hair, and although they were only about twenty inches high they were quite fierce. Once set loose they would not stop till they had their prey, and they had but to touch them. Their touch caused such tremendous mental anguish that they need no rope to bind with.       Reluctantly, the girl stopped and leaned up against a solid oak to catch her breath. The sound of nearby twigs snapping urged her forward, so she brushed the sweaty curls from her brow and continued to run.  The Torments were gaining. All they could think of was the girl and they raced after her never losing her from their sight. She could feel the yellow eyes boring into her back. Sweat poured down her temples, and her side ached and begged her to stop but still she ran. She had to. She had stolen the First Book and there was no turning back now.  The book clutched to her chest didn’t look like anything special. It was bound in age mottled leather and was rather worn but she held it like something precious.         Ahead of her loomed the Hairy Forest, the most dangerous place in REM, but the girl ran in without a second thought. She had to get away from the Torments. She had to find a safe haven for the book.       In her haste she never noticed the glowing. Everly just ran right through the yellow, blue and green swirling vortex of light that had suddenly opened ahead of her. If she had seen it, she probably would’ve gone around it to some other adventure, but that would make this a very different story. In fact there might not be any story at all, except that she did see it.      The sudden quiet made her realize she was suddenly alone. Nausea rumbled in her belly as the tumbling sensation hit.  Everly was falling and it seemed like a very long way down.

Would you keep it to yourself; or would you share it with a friend or even the world? Would that letter change your life or would you still live a secular life? What would you do with the letter, would you read it right away or leave it on a shelf for years to come? Well let me present to you to…..      A letter from God   By: Adam M. Snow      Dear My Child,       My Child why have you gone and forsaken me for this secular life you now live? Don’t you know that I had my one and only son shed his blood upon that tree for you and all my children? My Child I will never forsake you; I am always there for you. You run to me I will run to you; you ask me for forgiveness, I will forgive My Child. It is not mine or yours fault that you live in this world gone cold; it’s not mine or yours fault that you’re living the way you are. Just remember My Child that I will always love you that my son’s blood has washed away your sins.    My Child I’ve seen so much hatred in your eyes towards your enemies. Have you not know that you’re to love thy enemy and not let thy hatred consume you? I know it’s hard to live in this world, but remember My Child that my son will soon return to bring all my children who truly believe in me home.    My Child I have wept for you and for all my children; knowing their fate in this hate filled world. Just remember, I am with you now and always, comforting you through these hard times My Child. Just remember that you always have a friend in me. I love you so much My Child. When you are down, I will lift you up. Just don’t give in to Satan’s lies. Follow me and I will lead you to the path of righteousness.     My Child if I was to knock on your door, would you let me come into your home or would you leave me estray? Just know that you are always welcome in my home. My Child my son Jesus Christ will return though I am saddened for all those who would be left behind. Are you one of those who would be left behind or would I be expecting you in my house? I can not choose for you My Child though you can choose the right path; the bible can help you My Child. I love you so much My Child.         Your Friend,   God      Ps. I forgive you.         You see in John 15: 5 it says, “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” It’s stating that we need God in our lives because if you or I was down without God we would stay down but with God’s help we would be lifted up and sat back on solid ground. It also states that if we stand for God he will also stand for all of us.         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 says "For the LORD himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the TRUMP of God: and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we be forever with the LORD."       Revelations 1:7-8 says "Behold, he comes with the clouds; and EVERY EYE SHALL SEE HIM, and they also which pierced him: and all kindred’s of the earth shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen. I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending, said the LORD, which is and which was, and which is to come, The Almighty."

I had just went to a interview earlier today with this company.. and I'm wondering if it's fake, is it a school, or what? I attended the one in Washington state.

20090307214801AAEgO3Y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Guys check out my prologue tell me what you want to happen and maybe i can add it!!!?	Please help....you can be totally harsh. I just want to know if i'm doing this whole thing right....      Prologue-   "“We’re moving,” Mum said softly under her breath.    Never in a million years did I ever think I would hear those words coming out of my mother's mouth. Hearing them right now is like hearing the horrible noise of someone scratching their nails on a blackboard or having a ten-pound weight dropped on your toes. My parents love New York, it's their home and it has been ever since they were born. They always do this to us. They tell us the bad news exactly at the wrong moments when we don’t want to hear them. I was standing in the living room shocked, jaw down to the floor, while Spencer and Abbie were arguing with Mum and Dad. They never win, so what’s the point in starting up a fight with them? I don’t want to move. Not now, not ever. I have a life here – one that I am perfectly content with and I don’t want to rebuild my life somewhere else where I’m not known. I ran to my room, shut my door and turned on my computer. I have to tell Allie. She’s my girlfriend, but I can’t. I don’t know how. She’ll hate my guts for sure. I heard knocking after knocking at my bedroom door, which started out soft and got harder with each thump. So I got up to get it, it’s the only way the knocking would stop. “Owen, what are we going to do?” Abbie asked, Spencer standing behind her. They came in and sat on my bed with worried looks on their faces.    “I don’t know,” I sighed a heavy sigh and looked at them both. Lost in thought was what I could interpret and I continued, “I have a girlfriend and I don’t know how to tell her that I am leaving.” The room got silent for a moment. No one spoke because we were all thinking of what to do.   "Maybe there's something in it for us,” Abbie looked at me and I looked at her and I could tell that we were thinking the same thing. Is he crazy? “We don't know why we're moving yet. We didn't actually talk to them, we yelled at them." Maybe he’s right and maybe there is a catch to all of this. Moving doesn’t necessarily happen to be a bad thing. “I mean, we should at least talk to them before jumping to any conclusions. Maybe it is a good thing.” Most of the time Spencer could be so calm and so optimistic. Sure, in every movie where a family moves the kids are angry at the beginning, but they grow to like it. I just hope we will.

20090307213453AAib3D8	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Applied knowledge is the real, true power.  Do you agree?	The saying "knowledge is power" (or rather, knowledge alone is power) is not true because when you know something and don't do anything with that knowledge, it's useless.  And then you ask yourself "Why spend so much time on something that isn't going to be useful to me right away?"  For example, when driving around a city area, if you know the traffic patterns during different times of the day, you'll make sure to avoid the areas that get congested during those times (6:00 a.m.--10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.--7:00 p.m. for example) and take alternate routes.  It's always good to travel before and after "rush hour" since this makes your trip easier.

At the end of the game   when everything is said and done   scores are set and reputations are established   the winner takes the trophy, the pride, and the bragging rights   but who takes home the shame, the embarassment, and the heavy weight of regret?       They say the winner takes it all   but do they really?      __________________________      This is the first time I've put down the poem down on "paper"...honest opinions please :)
20090307214050AAeLyQ5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would You Keep Reading?	The Psychiatrist was a short, balding man with glasses and a goatee. He was just about to go through a psychiatric evaluation with a new patient, Michael Cricket, but first he would like to get to know his patient. Not through actually talking to him, that would be absurd, what if he were actually unstable? But rather through his patient file, these seemed to be far more accurate than the patients themselves. As he read the file he noticed several odd things about this man, for one thing there is not record of his life from ages 20 to 30, and that he just suddenly reappeared in New York several days ago.                The psychiatrist sat in a chair across the room from Michael   “Mr. Cricket, today we shall be taking a Rorschach test, this test involves several ink-spattered-“      “I know what a Rorschach test is.”      “Then I shall continue”       the psychiatrist held up an Ink-spattered paper      “what do you see here?”      “I see an ink blot. Now may I leave? I’m getting tired of this.”      “ no Mr. Cricket, you may not. You are here for Psychiatric evaluation, and you will not leave until it is over, and we will then decide weather or not you are fit to live with other human beings in our society.”      “and if I fail your so-called evaluation test?”      “then you will be declared mentally unfit and will be removed”      “REMOVED FROM WHAT? Your tiresome evaluations? This unstable, foul, institution? From this earth?”      “Mr. Cricket, calm down.”      “WHY?” Michael knocked down the table next to his chair that held his medications and water. “SO YOU CAN TEST ME? So you can probe my mind and decide weather or not I am unfit? Problematic? Who gets to decide weather or not I am problematic? You? Society?”      Michael saw the psychiatrist press a red button on his chair.      “WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?!”      Two large men burst into the room.      “oh.”      A large man hit Michael on the top of the head with a knightstick.
20090307214058AAPXEFc	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	How do you find your talent?	All my life I've been told that everyone has at least one talent yet I don't seem to have one. If been looking all my life for any possible talent I may have, but never find it. I'm even starting to doubt that I'm good for anything really, because I'm just not good at literally anything I have ever tried. I spent 3 years playing guitar but still never even learned a single song, even my instructors said I shouldn't even bother. I've also never won anything and when I participated in ether sports or events I would come dead last. I've also never had any friends and was always bullied causing me to hate people on a global scale. So in one last hope I'm asking people all over the internet for advice. How do you find your talent?

Hey, so my class just finished reading the play a midsummer night's dream and now we have to write an essay on one of the following topics. The problem is I have no idea what topic to choose! They all seem kind-of vague to me and i dont think i can write a whole essay on one of them. While anyways here are the topics   1- Who is the hero/heroine of this play   2- classify/generalize about either the men or women in this play   3- This play represents 3 different groups from 3 different worlds: Athenians, fairy, and working class. If you could pick one group as central or dominant which would it be? defend your choice against the next best choice   4-plays are often about conflict and resolution. cite the nature of the conflict and the point of resolution for the following pairs. Hermia/Lysander, Oberon/Titania, Helena/Demetrius   5- This play represents 2 distinct worlds in contrast (Athens and the fairy forest). identify the characteristics of each and cite evidence of how these two worlds are in conflict      which topic do you think i should choose? and what could i include in it?   Thank-you sooo much~

20090307224509AAYyjd3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me with names for my characters, best gets 10 points?	1. MUST be an acronym for her name. She is a 14 year old girl who was engineered to be able to distort space and time. She is normally emotionless but becomes more human as the story progresses. Her name must be a girl name, but also an acronym which represents that she is a weapon.      2. An ex-government agent who quits to protect the girl (number 1). He lives his life by the rule "Always do the right thing.". He is 30 and has a stubble beard and smokes.      3. A 14 year old boy who helps out number 1 when she is being attacked by a bunch of agents. He carries around a BB gun normally but buys a revolver later in the story. He is normally a happy and very funny person, but will do anything to help people.       4. A girl who engineered the design for number 1. She tries to find her after she is broken out. She is very socially awkward but smart and athletic. Wears glasses and is kind of tall. Only 23 years old.      5. A boy who is a weapon like number 1. Also has to be an acronym. Preferably if the two names (number 1 and number 5) have something to do with each other.

20090307230738AAHB8Xx	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is this argument sounds logical and reasonable  ?	An All-Virtuous Being Cannot Exist   1. God is (by definition) a being than which no greater being   can be thought.   2. Greatness includes the greatness of virtue.   3. Therefore, God is a being than which no being could be   more virtuous.   4. But virtue involves overcoming pains and danger.   5. Indeed, a being can only be properly said to be virtuous if   it can suffer pain or be destroyed.   6. A God that can suffer pain or is destructible is not one   than which no greater being can be thought.   7. For you can think of a greater being, one that is nonsuffering   and indestructible.   8. Therefore, God does not exist.

Still to be neat, still to be dressed,   As you were going to a feast;   Still to be powdered, still perfumed:   Lady, it is to be presumed,   Though art's hid causes are not found,   All is not sweet, all is not sound.

Title:    Hater of the World      Neon signs flash inane advice to   her waned mind. Telling her she   is of no use to the world. An ominous   moon shines scintillating before her,   warning of otherwise unpredictable events   about to befall upon her. Vagrant and pallor, she   longs for the candy of the heavens. Longs to   make it to zenith, longs to be in peace.   Misanthrope she is and knows   because of that she will never make it there.   A dark shadow hangs over her gaunt   figure. A shadow of guilt, loneliness, and   despair. Lurid forms, demons,   surround her, waiting to drag her   into an unknown hell.                 L.H.

When writing a science fiction novel, if some of the fiction is based on the existing theory of a particular real-life theorist, what is/isn't allowed?  Must the theory be tweaked so it doesn't mimic the theorist's publications?  Could I use the theorist's name if he is alive, or would I need his permission?  If I choose to use the theory as-is, could/should I cite the theorist and/or his works, and would I owe this theorist anything besides credit?

Apocalypse       The sun was beaming, the  earth revolved around it,   The flowers swayed in the cool spring breeze,   The sky was like a portrait, painted by the Gods,   The sea was a flawless dark blue that sparkled like diamonds.      All was well as a couple viewed the world,    The high-rise buildings that dominated the sky,   The green trees that brought life to the world,    The birds glided like planes that soared high.       The sun retreated in a hurry, the earth stood still,   The flowers were no longer swaying,    The earth’s duties, it could no longer fill.    The sea turned rough, our world is decaying.       The couple stood their ground and waited for the worst,   As the rain, wind and thunder attempted to break them down.   The earth trembled beneath their feet,    But the couple still stood strong – waiting for their time to come.      A great big ball of fire plummeted from the heavens,   As the final role call came, the Apocalypse.   For a moment, all was silent, all went dark,   As the lovers grasped each others hands,    Waiting to go to the promise land.

20090227113101AAIFwxZ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	You were simple, before   I fell over you.   Content,   that you knew your purpose,   which was to have   no purpose at all.      It suited you, I think,   that confident gait.    And you agreed.      But something was off.    There was an   odd limp in your step.   Something was broken.   Your soul, perhaps?      I knew I could fix it,   and I did.    It shone like it never had,   and you even smiled sometimes.      But I was silly,   thinking   others would mind your bruises.      I realized I had been cheated,   Fooled by   My own happiness      It wasn’t I, but he   who brought you peace.   You found sanity   in death’s arms.

20090307162036AAUS9J0	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Other - Visual Arts	Does anyone have any tips for a graphic design meeting?	I'm 14 years of age, currently a freshman in high school, and a great opportunity has come to my attention. A friend of my dad knows the head designer a Ziba Design and he was able to get an appointment with him for me. This is basically just to ask him questions, and I get a tour of the company, but if it all goes well It's a possibility I could end up with an internship! While I am extremely grateful and excited for this, I'm also very stressed out. Considering this is the first time I've ever participated in something like this, I don't quite know what to wear or really how I should go about it all. If anyone could give me some tips on questions to ask (although I already do have a few in my mind), what to wear, and just anything else you can think of, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
