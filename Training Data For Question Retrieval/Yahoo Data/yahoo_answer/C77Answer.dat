t3QAaSN9aa	Republicans/conservatives always have answers for how to improve the economy and not one of their policies has ever worked. On the contrary,  Republican economic ideas as practiced for the past 8 years have put us into this mess to begin with.  My current view is that if Republicans recommend some economic course of action, we should probably do just the opposite. <br>  <br>  It is clear that the economy has not as yet bottomed out. Obama's actions so far, such as the stimulus plan, have not as yet taken effect.  Eliminating capital gains tax is not going to help.

Example a line item for a maglev train to Disneyland would be an earmark while money for an undesignated high speed train would not be one. All of the silly sounding projects people have said are in it, are only projects that might apply to get money under a competitive process.<br>  <br>  So the real answer is we do not know. I think that is worse.<br>  <br>  It's not true that the bill contains spending for "golf carts." It has $300 million to buy fuel-efficient vehicles, some of which may be electric cart-like utility vehicles like those already in use on military bases and at other government facilities.<br>  <br>  Money claimed to be for "remodeled federal offices" is mostly designated for upgrading buildings to "green" status through such things as thicker insulation and highly efficient lighting, not new drapes or paneling.<br>  <br>  A widely repeated claim that $8 billion is set aside for a "levitating train" to Disneyland is untrue. That total is for unspecified high-speed rail projects, and some of it may or may not end up going to a proposed 300-mph "maglev" train connecting Anaheim, Calif., with Las Vegas.<br>  <br>  There's no money in the bill specified for butterfly parks or any of the projects listed by I love being right below., Frisbee golf courses or water slides , despite a GOP congressman's claim that the bill "will fund" those projects. He culled those silly-sounding items from a list of 18,750 city projects that the U.S. Conference of Mayors cobbled together as examples of "shovel-ready" projects.

uxu8qJUYaa	Outside a few great answers like Tom T's and Dr M's I am actually fearful for the way some people are thinking.  The idea of the government owning everything is truly the enemy of the state.  The government owning everything leads to slavery before any other modern concept.  <br>  <br>  If the government owned everything, then what? First you every mom and pop business in America, every one gets the same wage. You destroy the larger corporations and the need to compete.  If you go into any given field, your choices are to work for the government or...?  So you can not compete for a wage.  That's ridiculous, that's slavery.  What happens if your boss is an @-hole and harasses you then fires you and you have no witnesses, well time for a new profession if you can get it.  Where would you shop?  With all lunch meat now the same, all milk now the same, all pricing now the same, there is only need for 1 or 2 super centers in your town.  No more shopping around or coupons.  Can you imagine if the government owned the housing industry top to bottom.  Your housing would be a carbon copy from coast to coast, and if the plumbing is sub par, well you can not choose from anything else.  Free will and ideas would be stagnant. <br>  <br>  Cars - same engine, except for different models, only about 10 of them if that.<br>  Churches, temples, etc - now in the hands of the government.<br>  Sporting equipment - from fishing to baseball you are now limited<br>  Fast food - Burgers made the same at every location.<br>  Pizza - Only one type left, but which kind? Papa John's or Jeno's?<br>  Utilities - if you are fortunate enough to live in an area where you can choose different phone carries or waste management service, kiss that good bye.<br>  <br>  And here is the sad fact, I have never seen liberals 100% honest about their liberal leadership.  For instance, look at the "approval ratings game."  Liberals will have consistently disapproved of Republicans because they are Republicans, even when the Republican acts moderate or liberal in some areas.  Conservatives will disapprove when the Republican is liberal in some areas, etc. The liberals will NEVER approve of a Republican no matter what.  On the other hand, even if a conservative never approves of a Democrat (though I know this not to be the case), liberals NEVER disapprove of their Democratic leadership, even when the act conservative on an issue, because they are a Democrat.<br>  <br>  Sure, I believe this existence on both sides, but it comes loudly from the left and more often.  This is hypocrisy and sadly, more so that this closed-mindedness from the enlightened left being the enemy of the United States, it is truly the enemy to their own well being.|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	In the case of your question the simple answer meets with the honest answer.  No.  Our government rightfully dismantles monopolies in the interest of fair competition in a free market because monopolies are not forced the be the best they can be when they have eliminated their competition for it is through that competition that big business is coerced into being efficient.  Our government has no competition and could not survive in a business environment because of its massive inefficiency through bumbling bureaucratic incompetents and the elected leaders who make policy for them.  The private sector, because of competition, is forced to do it better.|`|GtazNrplaa	Hell I hope so or they are a wast of time electing them into office.

Then have you ever heard of "Air America"? The list goes on! I was a civilian and had access to many areas in the Nam, I had no travel restrictions at all! It was far worse than Iraq! As for security, it was provided by the special forces and Marines! In 18 months, 68-69, I never carried a weapon as I moved about the country and City of Saigon freely. I endured many rocket attacks and such but no attacks directed at me in particular even though I had an apartment in the City in the general areas where the Vietnamese lived not protected by security forces. I payed rent to my Vienmanese landlord and was the only american in the large appartment building.<br>  <br>  Edit----for:**** Broken Veteran 7****----- There are many of us who Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your service and the heavy price you have paid for our freedom!

He got back benifits and in his words is now set for life. This is little to late as he has endured over 30 years of demons and the living hell of PTSD.

These are all things the government does better than any private company could do, because they have refined it down to a fine art.<br>  The problem is we need new blood in D.C. so maybe they can create new ways to scam the tax payer.

When you, as a private individual, go to spend money on something for yourself you care about price and quality and when they meet your standards you make the purchase.  <br>  <br>  When you buy something for someone else your still paying for it so you care about price but your not going to personally consume it so you care less about the quality.  <br>  <br>  Finally, if you go to purchase something with money that's not yours to buy something your not personally going to consume, you care neither for price nor quality.  <br>  <br>  It's called a third party purchase, because you buying something with money that's not yours and your not going to consume it.

doHNEvf8aa	Prime Minister Gordon Brown|`|mVlRpc97aa	Prime Minister Gordon Brown in recent meetings with President Obama<br>  <br>  Did Brown let the cat out of the bag?  Is there a turf war happening among the global elites & the banksters?  Either way, we are scr---wed!<br>  <br>  Here is a good article on it:<br>  <br>  FEATURE ARTICLES<br>  "Outlaw the Shadow Banking System!" - Guess Who Said It? - By Matthias Chang   <br>  Saturday, 07 March 2009 10:20<br>  <br>  When I read the remarks of President Obama and Prime Minister Gordon Brown after their meeting at the Oval Office on March 3, 2009 and the speech of the latter to the Joint Session of Congress on March 4, 2009, I realized that a growing antagonism has emerged between certain factions of the ruling elites in the City of London and in Washington DC.<br>  <br>  The first warning of the acute differences was sounded by President Obama himself and it was most surprising that the mass media paid hardly attention to it. In his weekly address on February 28, 2009, President Obama said:<br>  <br>  “I realize that passing this budget won’t be easy.  Because it represents real and dramatic change, it also represents a threat to the status quo in Washington. I know that the insurance industry won’t like the idea that they’ll have to bid competitively to continue offering Medicare coverage, but that’s how we’ll help preserve and protect Medicare and lower health care costs for American families.  I know that banks and big student lenders won’t like the idea that we’re ending their huge taxpayer subsidies, but that’s how we’ll save taxpayers nearly $50 billion and make college more affordable.  I know that oil and gas companies won’t like us ending nearly $30 billion in tax breaks, but that’s how we’ll help fund a renewable energy economy that will create new jobs and new industries. In other words, I know these steps won’t sit well with the special interests and lobbyists who are invested in the old way of doing business, and I know they’re gearing up for a fight as we speak.  My message to them is this:<br>  <br>   <br>  “So am I.”<br>  <br>   Read the underlined words again.<br>  <br>  It is clear something is definitely amiss within the ruling elites and President Obama has thrown the gauntlet to his adversaries. The skeptics may say that we should not read too much into this above quoted paragraph, as it could be mere spin to rally the troops in times of crisis. Time will tell.<br>  <br>  I take the view that it is inevitable that the members of the ruling elites would go for each other’s throats because those who were given the charge to ensure that the money-machine keeps running have screwed up big time. Someone must answer for the fiasco.<br>  <br>  If the Mafia would kill without hesitation when one of its casinos have been ripped off by some smart dudes, it would be na?ve to assume that the status quo would remain, when the Global Trillion Dollar Casino is for all intents and purposes broken down beyond repair.<br>  <br>  Confirmation that the blame game has started in earnest can be found in the aforesaid remarks of President Obama and Prime Minister Gordon Brown on March 3, 2009 given after their meeting at the Oval Office and Brown’s speech to Congress on March 4, 2009.<br>  <br>  Before quoting them in extenso, let me digress to say that it is with much satisfaction, that this fallout has not only shaken the very foundations of the global power structures, but it has also muzzled my bankrupt political enemies.<br>  <br>  Many scoffed and ridiculed me when I warned repeatedly in my ground-breaking book “The Shadow Money-Lenders and the Global Financial Tsunami” that the shadow money-lenders were the culprits behind the global financial tsunami. I was labeled a “conspiracy theorist”, “a doomsayer”, “alarmist” and the barking dogs from both sides of the political divide in Malaysia would use the popular website “Malaysia Today” to heap the most obscene profanities on me!<br>  <br>  They have now all scampered away like frightened dogs with their tails between their legs!<br>  <br>  Let us come back to the issue of the money-lenders. For some strange reason, many people are put off by the term “money-lenders” but are ever so comfortable with bankers.<br>  <br>   But are not bankers, money-lenders?<br>  <br>  In fact I would say that money-lenders are more honourable than your high street bankers, as they can only rob you in the millions. The global bankers, they rape and plunder in the trillions!<br>  <br>  Is it any wonder that Gordon Brown and President Obama, the political representatives of the Power Elites have decided that it is about time that these financial harlots are to be brought under control before they wreck the entire global power structure?<br>  <br>  Let us have no illusions about Obama and Gordon Brown. They are going after these financial harlots not because they want to protect us from these criminals, but because for too long the political faction had to play second fiddle to the financial faction in the overall scheme of global one world government.<br>  <br>  Until lately, money power triumphed over political power. However, when the entire financial|`|4160f1b362be1a382ff4fa170d98797caa	Matthias Chang|`|dWH45KTlaa	Sounds like something Obama would say|`|tltloVKpaa	Reid or Pelosi|`|ly4INzzTaa	FDR?|`|Wq8vQqvbaa	Gordon Brown|`|AA11702773	Yeah, but they're going to 'get rid of the Fed' with something global and worse, if they have their way.

However, if the parent can reform him/herself, I think that would be much more in the child's interest than taking him away from the parents. Why should the child have to suffer because the parent is irresponsible? I think that the family should have an intervention and send that parent to rehab, where he can reform in a temptation-free, professionally-controlled environment.

To covert away from the faith is to court death.<br>  <br>  Reason #3 Obama is a Muslim.  <br>  <br>  When Obama was talking to a New York Times reporter,  he said the Muslim call to prayer is one of most beautiful sounds he ever heard.  He even recited it for the reporter who got it on tape.   A part of the call to prayer is the declaration of faith.  If you say it,  you automatically become a Muslim.   <br>  <br>  The reporter obviously will not release the tape as that would clearly confirm Obama said it.<br>  <br>  Reason #4 Obama is a Muslim.<br>  <br>  Not one...NOT ONE Muslim leader has said that Obama is not a Muslim.

Depends on who you ask. The die hards who still believe in the tactic will tell  you one thing and those who never wanted it will tell  you another. I think time will tell. What matters is that the American public finally came to their senses and decided to get the hell out. We need the money here. Unfortunately Obama has decided that we need to go back to stabilize Afghanistan. Again, he should look to the decade the Soviets spent there. Now Pakistan is having problems, ugh. It will never end.  <br>  I think we went in because the previous administration really believed they could be the ones to establish democracy in the area. I kind of think that it was a sincere wish.

AA10829691	Human rights is a natural right we all acquire.No law can be made to contradict this right! Yes it is universal it is a moral and ethical law of the universe.However, different cultures have different ways of realising this right.The modes of realisation are different.Thus every country has a legal right to choose thier choice of achieving thier human rights. Human rights lawyers are in a sense cultural imperiailists in a sense. They try to eliminate the immoral realisation of these rights trying to encourage countries to take a more moral approach.Thus in my view they try to create a common ground for countries to realise human rights which I think is thier main goal.They try to encourage third world countries such as africa to use approaches by western socieities.But it is a bit unfair to coerce our methods at the expense of thiers.Then to a degree we rob them of thier rights to deal with thier situations how they seem fit,unilateraly agreeing that our way is the right and should be the universal way!|`|onbwN4csaa	All human rights are god given.

These Obama this..Obama that... blame game is counterproductive and serves no real purpose.  <br>  <br>  These are serious times and they have been for a long time.  Making things better should be the goal of EVERY American.  You can't just sit on your couch  or at your computer and criticize.  You need to do something positive to make things better, even if it doesn't satisfy your need to put the blame somewhere.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, I would venture to add that there has to be a connection between the CEO'S of major corporations walking away with billions of dollars while their companies lay people off.  Now we are learning about the Bernie Madoffs of the world and how they have devastated the lives of people...by swindling them out of billions of dollars. Thain spent millions on office furniture.  The list goes on and on.  Let's hold these people accountable for their actions and stop blaming the current President for what we as Americans have allowed to happen by allowing the economic crisis to become a runaway train. <br>  <br>  Our corporate greed and theft has done this damage by eroding confidence in the market causing it to plunge .|`|E638ukebaa	You forget that Bush killed over 4000 US troops and spent $3TRILLION DOLLARS ON A WAR HE COULDN'T END.|`|lHDff8Braa	You do realize that under both Bush and Obama, we've pumped trillions into Wall Street, yet for some reason, the market keeps falling.<br>  <br>  Seems to me that the greedy corporate Wall Street Overlords should be using our tax money for its intended purpose of opening up the credit market, instead of hoarding it and buying $38,000 drapes.<br>  <br>  I don't see how corporate greed is a policy of Obama.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	I suppose we see a recession that began in December of 2007 as the culprit for a tanking economy.  This is serious stuff.  Too serious to put the blame on a President who has only been in office seven weeks.|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	The Democrats who even realize that the market has fallen dramatically since the election, and again since the inauguration are ignoring it.  Obama himself said he doesn't pay attention to the stock market.<br>  <br>  And then we know that the majority of Obama's supporters didn't know that the Dems controlled congress since 2006, and that shortly thereafter things began to crumble.  Many of these people don't know the difference between liberal and conservative.<br>  <br>  I suppose that's why Obama's ratings are still high, because the dumb who voted for him actually do believe that Bush was responsible for the market shrinkage.<br>  <br>  MORE:  Yup, like I said those above me don't even realize that since 2006 Dems Dodd and Frank BLOCKED the Republican strategy to repair the economy before it tanked.<br>  <br>  Like I said, the dumb liberals.|`|cIPziIdnaa	I think the Democrats are terrified that the markets have not responded very favorably to Obama's economic recovery plans..... and so the White House is "wagging the dog", creating a national distraction by picking a fight with a radio talk show host.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	The stock market has yet to hit bottom. Oh, the liberals will lose that pride when they lose all their money. But then again, they are still getting that leg tingle so that left wing pride will hang on until the rope breaks.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	No we don't want the stock market to plunge. We wanted Obama because McCain's policies are the same as Bush's policies.

t3QAaSN9aa	I find it strange that cons seem to forget that one major reason that Obama is president right now is because the Republicans crashed our economy.  If all of this downturn had first become apparent after he took office then maybe your comments about the economy might possibly make sense.  <br>  <br>  The reality is that the economic downturn was predicted years ago but the Republican administration went blithely along pretending that all was well.  The economy has not as yet bottomed out.  President Obama is trying to make the landing less difficult and is looking to the future recovery. <br>  <br>  He is not however a miracle worker and he can't fix the ailing economy in 7 weeks. If that is what you expected then of course you will be disappointed.|`|AA11313983	All he has to do is come up with an explanation as to how the entire path is necessary for "free" health care.

No need to implant chips when making sure everyone is financially dependent on Washington works so much better, and Obama isn't Muslim (even if Muslims consider him to be one and consider his lack of faith a sin punishable by death).<br>  <br>  Leftists won't be happy until there are troops on every corner and neighbors are informing on neighbors. But hey, at least the trains will run on time.|`|DrmUP3Kmaa	You are missing the Point Goofball.  What Obama is doing is what his followers want.  There are people that think people who work hard and make something of their life's did so by stepping no the backs of the poor.  Therefore it is ok to take their money and give it to someone who does nothing.  You know Money for Nothing, and Chicks for Free The problem is is that the Government does not make money they steal it from the people.  When there are less producers than there are free loaders Were are the hand outs going to come from?|`|n9HAc3H2aa	But you see, Obama just keeps dangling the carrot in front of them... free free free... you will not have to pay.. the rich will pay... free free free.<br>  <br>  And down the path toward socilism the liberal losers go....<br>  <br>  Lemmings... I hope they reach the cliff soon.<br>  <br>  MARGARET THATCHER said:   “The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people’s money.”|`|vRY2vExRaa	I think you mean nationalization.

47TSqkEGaa	I am because he is trying his best to figure out to better our economy. He is trying to strengthen our health care system. Bush was a president who just wanted to fight and use military spending. That was what contributed to the weakened economy. Stem cell research is a way to save lives and improve health complications. However, republicans are in favor of not using that. I just think that our president is putting forth an effort to improve America.|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	What does it matter? America is financially bankrupt and its all down hill from here on out! Barack Obama, Rush Limbaugh, Lou Dobbs or anyone else cannot change the position this nation is in financially, its bankrupt beyond the point of no return! This has been allowed to happen over the last 50 years! Social Security is in crisis, there is no fix other than cutting benefits or raising taxes or doing both! Plain & simple, you cannot fix overnight what has been going wrong for years and years, decade after decade! Perhaps Jesus Christ could, but why would he help this nation who cast him out of everyday life like he was the cause of the "Black Plague!" Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall! America it was a good run while it lasted, but now its time to pay the fiddler and this nation has no money!|`|7MKJWM9Saa	If he had Ron Paul's ideas I would love the man!

m24wuDzwaa	Maybe actually being able to get health care. Instead of an insurance policy that refuses to provide treatment when we really need it.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	When you God Forbid lose your job you will get something exactly like Medicare.

No metal detectors or guards. If you do not have an emergency you can check in over the internet before you arrive or check in by computer in the office. <br>  <br>  You tell them how long it will take you to get to the hospital and they call you when they can see you. The waiting rooms are always empty because patients do not come in until the doctors can see the patient. It could happen that a real emergency comes in while you are in transit, but it is rare. If the wait is going to be long they will call you and tell you that if you wish you can wait at home. <br>  <br>  The doctors and nurses can see the patient's that are coming in with their complaints and complete medical history in every room. They frequently contact people at home that do not thing they have an emergency and tell them an ambulance is enroute because they do have an emergency.|`|wtcAK31Paa	We aren't going to do away with private health insurance.

Why not try to improve it?|`|w2zlb5r0aa	You are very confused, but this does not surprise me since there are hundreds of myths out there concerning government-sponsored health care.<br>  <br>  Firstly, the buildings and facilities themselves have nothing to do with it.  In certain countries (namely, the UK), there are government-run hospitals much like the county hospitals in the U.S.  Some people say these hospitals are good; some say they are bad.  Regardless, it does not really matter because government-sponsored health care in the U.S. is different from this system.<br>  <br>  The Dems. are proposing government-run insurance systems based on models in place in France, Germany and Austria.  In these countries, the hospitals are mostly privately owned, but, insurance is provided by the government.  <br>  <br>  So, you're whole argument is based on the false pretense that we will get UK style health facilities that are wholly-managed by the government.  This is not going to happen anytime soon in the U.S.|`|pe1miZ7Faa	I don't know where you live but here we don't have metal detectors ,guards, or heavy cement planters. And im all for universal health care! I had to wait 7 hours at a hospital! and then I had to pay about $1,000! And how is this an example of universal health care? The hospital is like that every single day!!  You wait for hours every single day. And we don't even have universal health care! It's like that with private health care. So I don't see how this is supposed to be an example.

RD5sTZaFaa	You and I both are pro-choice.<br>  <br>  Others are of the belief that the woman who wants to terminate a pregnancy should have to resort to illegal and unsanitary methods formally used in the back alleys of this country where a fetus would have its life ended by a jab with a clothes hanger, often also ending the life of the woman who had found herself pregnant with no alternatives.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|rwrDD14Jaa	It seems that your pro-choice because you stated that you personally would not have an abortion but you believe that it should be a legal thing for other people to do.

That's why I don't like labels.  But I do agree with your position entirely.|`|GHgptLAsaa	Well pro-choice means that you are 100% for the woman's choice which in some cases means abortion.

(Ross Perot was potentially the last effective leader we could have had).<br>  Some context is necessary before resorting to innuendos and outlandish historical comparisons: Or perhaps you think that General Petraeus would just be another "communist radical islamist bent on destroying America", in that case I would rest my case.<br>  <br>  From the Associated Press: <br>  "The idea of cooperation with some in the Taliban has been talked about for many months by American military commanders including Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command.<br>  <br>  "If you talk to Gen. Petraeus, I think he would argue that part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists, but who were willing to work with us," said Obama.<br>  <br>  "There may be some comparable opportunities in Afghanistan and the Pakistani region, but the situation in Afghanistan is, if anything, more complex," Obama added.<br>  <br>  Last month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that Washington could accept a political agreement between the Afghan government and the Taliban if the insurgents will lay down their arms and accept the government's terms".<br>  <br>  And it is basically the strategy used in Iraq, courageously put forward by General Petraeus: Paying former enemies (who had taken part in slaughtering American troops) to switch sides and accept to isolate Al-Qaida. In theory, from a grandstanding point of view, it was not a pretty idea, but it was probably the only effective one out there, and this General took the responsibility for implementing it.|`|4ErIxkhyaa	Do you mean that new West Coast street Gang "the Taliban"<br>  <br>  I noticed last night that the FBI reached out to them with State wide busts.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Here is a quick look <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11862281?source=most_viewed" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11862281?s...</a><br>  <br>  It's nice to see Obama's influence in the Hood.<br>  <br>  EDIT part Deux:<br>  <br>  Oh you mean the other Taliban.

All the money for condoms should have clued you in on what is next.|`|Ko2QX3Cvaa	You're mistaken. The president is sending our tax dollars overseas to aid those in need of health care without the restriction that such aid may not include abortion services. This simply allows more money to go to more aid groups. I would think even anti-choice proponents might concede that the benefits outweigh their perceived negatives, here. <br>  <br>  As to Roe V Wade - it's alive, now. But recent restrictions against partial-birth procedures and new legislation such as Georgia Senate Bill 169 are quickly working to restrict the rights the Roe V Wade ruling provided. Such restrictions provide foot holds for court cases that could quite conceivably reach the Supreme Court, which is comprised chiefly of Republican-appointed men. If that ever happened, Roe V Wade could easily be overturned. FOCA would not be nearly so simple to dissolve. So yes, it is about keeping abortion legal.<br>  <br>  I didn't see your $400 million figure in either of the links you provided, so I'm curious - is this money being added to amount we spend on foreign aid, or is Obama simply allowing $400 million of already-alloted funds to be used by groups that offer abortion as an option? And even your newest Fox News link concedes that Obama isn't assigning aid money directly to fund abortions - he's just not dissallowing funds for organizations that offer the procedure.<br>  <br>  You talk about Catholic hospitals being forced to offer abortion as though it's an impending certainty. The only talk of this was seen in FOCA's original language, written years ago, so it's hardly fair to blame Obama directly. Additionally, I don't think you have any cause to worry yet, seeing as no one in government has discussed reintroducing the act. Even if they did, I highly doubt it was pass in it's original form. For what it's worth, I don't think it would be fair to cut federal funding from Catholic hospitals just because they refuse to provide abortion.

SutVrwoHaa	I've done a little storm chasing in the past, now I coordinate news crews to do it.  I prefer to intercept rather than chase them.  We get our meteorologist, then figure where the worst part of the storm is going and try to get ahead of the storm.  Then shoot our video when the storm comes through.  This is a whole lot better than static storm damage after the fact although I have shot many a structure fire caused by lightning.  <br>  Where you are likely to run into cops is when the storm has passed and they're out blocking flooded  roads, protecting downed power lines etc.  If that's the case your best bet is follow their instructions.  You'll find that if you cooperate they will help you most of the time.   <br>  Your activities are protected by the First Amendment but this doesn't give you anymore access to a scene than the general public unless the authority in charge allows it.  With that said no one can stop you from filming anything,  I run into this from time to time at accidents and I usually just ignore whoever it is telling me to stop.  You are under no obligation to do so.  Anyway the  police are unlikely to ever tell you to stop shooting while storm chasing although  they may make you move if you are in the way or in danger.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	The police are obligated to protect the public safety.

It started with Congress encouraging lending to lower-income people. You went from subprime loans being 2% of total loans in 2002 to 30% of total loans in 2006. That kind of enormous increase swept into the net people who shouldn’t have been borrowing.<br>  <br>  Those loans were packaged into CDOs rated AAA, which led the<br>  investment-banking firms [buying them] to do little to no due diligence, and the securities were distributed throughout the world, where they started defaulting.<br>  <br>  When they started defaulting, out of bad luck or bad judgment, we implemented fair value accounting….You had wildly different marks for this kind of security, which led to massive write-offs by the commercial banking and investment-banking system.<br>  <br>  In the face of those losses…you needed to raise new equity which came from sovereign-wealth funds in part, which then caused political resistance to sovereign-wealth funds, who predictably have withdrawn from putting money into the system….It seemed pretty obvious that would happen. We now find ourselves with a liquidity crisis where fundamentally the cost of money for financial intermediaries [such as investment banks] is significantly in excess of their cost of lending it.

I mean seriously, how stupid is it to tell a business, "Instead of going after the customers you think are best - those who are most able financially to afford a home - we're going to require you to do business with those you would not normally give a loan to."  And why?  So that people with less money (many minorities) won't feel 'left out', disavantaged, or hurt.  Political correctness is partly to blame.

3oNcHdgCaa	Yes, they were. But back in the 18th century there were no long term prison facilities, except for debtors (who weren't exactly dangerous criminals). Official punishments were therefore limited to fines, public whippings, and executions (unofficial punishments included tarring and feathering, lynching, etc.)|`|86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	The death penalty was obviously legal when the Bill of Rights was created, and three clauses in the Fifth Amendment recognized that the death penalty would be used.<br>  Here is the entire text of the Fifth:<br>  "No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."<br>  <br>  "A capital crime" is obviously one in which a person can be sentenced to death, a person can be deprived of life WITH due process of law, and a person can be put in jeopardy of their life for a crime they committed, but only once for that particular crime.|`|crbDVI29aa	Of course they were for the death penalty, and for public stockades, too.

To start, most of them have lost touch with reality, if they ever were in touch to begin with. Its simple. How many men with guns are surrounding Congress. They all have body guards (armed) of some form or another when in public, so they have no need for one. But don't kid yourself, a lot of them do own own guns (they just don't disclose it). They have agendas to follow and want to stay in power. If a bunch of uninformed tools get them elected, and those tools hate guns, then you can figure out the rest. On the other hand, some of them actually believe that is you just make smores by the campfire and love each other enough, violence will go away and guns will not be needed. Then there is the worst. The most noteable loudmouths of the DNC (and we know who they are). They simply want to disarm America for the same reason the British did the colonists, the Nazis did the Germans, Stalin did the Russians, etc. They don't want the public being able to defend themselves against a government takeover when an if the opportunity presents itself. They hate freedom (except their own), they hate prosperity (except their own), and they want a socialist dictatorship. Look at their policies! They use fabricated shooting stats and try to link any and all crime to guns. They rely on stupid people to support them under the belief that if the general public can't get guns, then the bad guys can't either. Just look at the crime surge in Australia since 1997 when they banned guns. Look at the gun crime surge in Britain since their ban on guns. The criminals still have them!  Our democrats are a bunch of socialist agendests that will fabricate anythin they can to justify disarming America so they can fullfill their communist dreams. No disarmed country has ever been free. Ever. Its harder for the MS 13 gangs to get illegal guns in that area for whatever reason, and they turn to knives. Its also harder to trace a knife crime, but I dont think they think that far. So if you want to be over taxed, undereducated, inundated by debt for failed social welfare programs, and unable to defend yourself, vote Democrat! Its easier than thinking>
glt02wg2aa	To bad that you can only do that when you sell and declare the loss.<br>  Better idea:<br>  Everyone stop buying 'big ticket items' (anything over $1000) - minimize taxes collected.

TJ8fgBpWaa	Men AND women, like in Israel. Since EVERYONE would have to do it, it wouldn't be a draft, it would be Universal Service.<br>  <br>  Most people don't realize that for every Army or Marine soldier "in the field" (Infantry) there are 10 or more soldiers NOT in the Infantry: they are in Logistics, Quartermaster, Avionics, Engineering, Armorer, Finance, Signal Corps, Aviation, Intelligence,Medical Corps, etc.<br>  <br>  There are literally HUNDREDS of jobs in the various branches of the military, many of them computer-related. The 'services' are a fine way to learn a trade and get paid to learn it; it also places you in "cooperative" situations in terms of living and working with people from all over the country and from all racial, ethnic, religious and educational backgrounds. <br>  <br>  Since the services are governed by "rank" and chain-of-command, the troops are able to learn interactive hierarchical skills that will stand them in good stead when they transition back to civilian life.<br>  <br>  I see all of it a s a great way to serve the country. And I would add, as a perk, a 2-year GI Bill so that they could attend a Community College or technical school after their term of service. Should they volunteer to serve 2 more years, I would have a 4-year GI Bill available to them. But unlike the present GI Bill, which has an expiration date, a use-it-or-lose-it 7 years, MY GI Bill would have NO expiration date, so that if they wanted to learn or upgrade skills later in life, the money would be there.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Nope.

Most young people today have never had to weigh the possibility of being drafted at an inopportune time in their life.  I enlisted in 1962 so it would be out of the way for the rest of my life and found it to be a rewarding experience.  A young person had to consider when military service, college, and marriage would happen in his/her life and the consequences of their decision.  Most don't have to make such choices today and feel no responsibility to their country or allegiance for that matter.  We seem to be raising more sponges.

IY9JolQ4aa	Well why don't we just separate all of the different races while we're at it?  It's not even a possibility that we would ever separate the US between Liberals and Conservatives. Plus, most of the bickering and fighting about the topic doesn't really take place in public it's mostly on the internet and TV. What needs to happen is liberals need to stop acting like the government owes the people something.

For example, I believe that although hand guns should be allowed, rapid firing guns should not. Is that the liberal view? On the other hand I think that marriage should be between a man and a woman. They can call union between same sex people whatever but not marriage. Is that a purely conservative view?|`|X9VDzvo4aa	What you're talking about is secession and that was tried once before.

In 8 years, the amount of money the Federal government takes in doubled.  The problem was not revenue; the problem was spending. <br>  <br>  Why do you think the wealthy (which includes a lot of people both Democrat and Republican) put their money in offshore accounts?  To avoid taxes!

If you were risking your money investing in a business and someone said hey you have to pay more taxes on the money you made would you continue?  Money invested is money at risk.  If it isn't worth the risk you don't invest.  If you want to see how many don't think its worth the risk look at the stock market.

I needed the money to help refinance my house and thanks to Bush, rather than Clinton I was able to save money in a pre-tax medical account to pay my daughters medical bills so i didnt lose where i live in the process.<br>  <br>  Clinton invested in the Chinese, not the middle class and proved only that sexual favors should take second place in the white house to doing your job as president.<br>  <br>  We as republicans, have no issue with taxation...we just dont like pork and feel that marxism in any form, ESPECIALLY OBAMAS is wrong, very very wrong.

When all is said and done over the next 5 years, the American National Debt more than likely will be at 35 to 45 trillion dollars and growing.

AA11494150	That would depend on department policy, but it is highly unlikely. First of all, it creates a liability issue for both the officer and the department if it malfunctions. <br>  <br>  Secondly, having the same weapon for everyone makes for consistent training at the range. <br>  <br>  My department allows me to carry a personal weapon for back up, but a Desert Eagle would not be practical for that purpose.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	The department dictates the weapon.|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	The Dept. determines what are the acceptable sidearms for officers.

xZBwnrGzaa	I would guess the US, UK, and Canada.<br>  <br>  Despite China's manpower, those men are untrained and poorly equipped. In fact, all of China's military is poorly equipped. Their tanks, guns, and aircraft were all Soviet and Russian surplus.<br>  <br>  China would try to win through a war of attrition. They might have a chance in this due to the manpower. Attrition warfare is simply war between to countries in which one tries to win through more resources. China wouldn't have a good chance in that though because the US and UK have NATO states, Indian states, ex-Soviet states, Israel, Australia, Japan, etc. Also, the US and UK have more resources than China in things like fuel, metal, building supplies, ships, aircraft, and tech.<br>  <br>  Also, China has one of the worst Navy's and Air Forces in the world (for a power). In its Navy, it has no Aircraft Carriers as well as some of the worst submarines. As I said before, most of its military hardware is Soviet Surplus.<br>  <br>  As for Russia, it's manpower is almost identical to the UKs. Not to mention that their troops are untrained. Russia/Soviet Union has not won a war since they helped the North Vietnamese.<br>  <br>  Also, Russia could not go into a war of Attrition with China. Despite its surplus in oil and fuel, it virtually has no money. It can barely afford its own weapons. <br>  <br>  Therefore, Russia would try to out manuevre us. It simply cannot do that. Its tactics are more suited to the Soviet Union, who had large amounts of troops and hardware. Russia does not have that.<br>  <br>  Also, Russia is large. Therefore it is overstretched. It wouldn't be able to hold onto the large majority of its land, especially the parts in Europe.<br>  <br>  And South Korea wouldn't join Russia or China. That would be more suited to the communist North Korea. South Korea is one of us. <br>  <br>  Assuming you meant North Korea, It would simply be a nuisance. Although it has a large number of troops, it has no experience since 50 years ago in the Korean War.

5BiBamrxaa	Yes it is illegal.<br>  Age of consent in the UK is 16.|`|OgEI9nD5aa	16|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Sixteen is the legal age of consent for sex and marriage here in UK.

As you can imaging, that has courted much controversy on both sides of the fence. :S<br>  <br>  But still, you might do well to consider if you really do want to sleep together at what is a relatively young age. If you want to hold off, there are many other ways that you can demonstrate your love for each other/ Many teenagers tend to regret losing their virginity so young, but it is ultimately up to both of you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Nope sorry Nick - 4 you are still wrong and experience tells me the Police often don't know the law they are supposed to enforce, so maybe you should direct your relative to the link I have given. You are putting some dangerous mis-info out there that could in theory put someone in court, just because Wikipedia says so does not make it so. The age of consent in the UK is 16 regardless of sex, if a person over the age of 16 has sex or sexually touches a person under the age of 16 then a criminal offence has been committed.<br>  <br>  I don't care what Wikipedia says the relevant Act of Parliament is the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which states:<br>  <br>  Section 13: Child sex offences committed by children or young persons<br>  <br>  22.     Section 13 makes it an offence for a person aged under 18 to do anything that would be an offence under any of sections 9 to 12 if he were aged 18 or over. The purpose of this section is to provide a lower penalty where the offender is aged under 18. In practice (although there is no provision about this in the Act) decisions on whether persons under 18 should be charged with child sex offences will be made by Crown Prosecutors in accordance with the principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. In deciding whether it is in the public interest to prosecute these offences, where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, prosecutors may take into consideration factors such as the ages of the parties; the emotional maturity of the parties; whether they entered into a sexual relationship willingly; any coercion or corruption by a person; and the relationship between the parties and whether there was any existence of a duty of care or breach of trust.<br>  <br>  Section 9 states: Section 9: Sexual activity with a child<br>  <br>  18.     Section 9 makes it an offence for a person (A) aged 18 or over to intentionally engage in sexual touching of a child under 16. Where the child is aged 13 or over but under 16, the prosecution must prove that A did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over. "Touching" is explained at section 79(8) and covers all forms of physical contact including penetration; "sexual" is defined at section 78. Whether or not the child consented to the activity is irrelevant<br>  <br>  Sorry for the rant but it irritates me when people quote from non-legal sources as if it where fact, especially where someone who follows their advice could end up on the wrong side of the law. Also apologies for the technical language but the information above is direct from the Act and therefore is worded for lawyers not the general public.<br>  <br>  That said, for the poser of the question, I think you have little to worry about, even in the unliklely event the Police were alerted if you were found out the CPS are unlikely to deem it in the public interest to prosecute as your boyfriend is so close to the age of consent and the age gap between you is so small. If you do go ahead just be sensible use protection.|`|gFRqZzY6aa	Technically it is illegal. However, the police will not prosecute because it is not judged to be in the public interest. If you were 26 and not 16 and were running around seducing lots of 15 year olds then yes you probably would be prosecuted, but they won't prosecute you for this.|`|c8DjmWXxaa	it is illegal until you are both 16, but in Britain as you know, people will turn a blind eye as your ages are very close, my only advice is that if you both are sure that yous ready then you must protect yourself from pregnancy and other stuff.<br>  good luck.|`|nhbjRA6Iaa	Its 16 + Be protected him or you.

So according to law (law doesn't look at level of force),  you touched him first, he could get your for assault.<br>  If you can, start recording his actions, audibly and visibly (camcorder;digital camera). But don't pursue him, don't initiate any conversation, and don't touch him. He has to come up to you in all those 3 examples.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	You assaulted him first by putting your hand on his chest.* Keep track of the sexual gesters and then sue him for sexual harassment.|`|T2WPvUc1aa	Under Texas law you assaulted him, when you placed your hand on his chest. First of all, it was not very smart of you at all, to confront someone who you know is on probation for a felony. You're lucky that he only shoved you to the ground, and didn't seriously hurt or kill you. Once you placed your hand on him, you were assaulting him and he has a right under Chapter 9 of the penal code to use the amount of force necessary to stop you. If he did nothing but push you to the ground I think that would be reasonable amount of force, as long as he did not do anything more.<br>  Here is what it says in 22.01 (a)(3) of the penal code:<br>  Sec. 22.01.  ASSAULT.  (a)  A person commits an offense if the person:<br>  (3)  intentionally or knowingly causes physical contact with another when the person knows or should reasonably believe that the other will regard the contact as offensive or provocative.<br>  <br>  This is a class-c misdemeanor under 22.01(c)<br>  <br>  Be careful of what you do. Getting into an argument with a felon could get you dead, and then noone will be able to help you.

1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Amendments to what?|`|86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	The US Constitution that was proposed by the convention in Philadephia, 1787, was not universally recognized as being outstanding. It did not have a Bill of Rights, and many opponents of ratification of the Constitution -- such as Thomas Jefferson -- said that the lack of Bill of Rights made the Constitution unacceptable to him. He wanted to be assured that the federal government could not violate the rights of the people, and a number of other opponents felt the same way. So James Madison assured Jefferson that amendments adding a Bill of Rights would be forthcoming as soon as the next Congress got elected. Madison ran for Congress, got elected, and proposed several amendments in order to fulfill his promise.
AbJNFwOIaa	You don't need a law degree to practice patent law.  You need a law degree to become a patent attorney or if you want to litigate.  However, you can prosecute patents as a patent agent even without a law degree.<br>  <br>  A bachelors degree in chemistry is sufficient for litigation.  Whether it is sufficient for patent prosecution is another question.  In my experience, having a masters or PhD in chemistry helps with respect to patent prosecution in the chemical arts.  That being said, I think pursuing an advanced degree in chemistry simply to pursue a career in patent law is a bad idea.
c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	I'll take on three of these that sound a lot like the kind of offhand generalizations Tom Clancy would make:<br>  1-"Generally speaking there was no such thing as an average fighter pilot. You were either an ace or a target."  GROSS simplification. While the majority of air/air kills went to "aces"-ANY crew who got that first kill, saw their experience level grow exponentially.  Squadron records clearly show this regardless of nation.  Secondly AFA "targets" nearly all aces were shot down at least once: in fact Bubi Hartman with over 300 victories was shot down at least six times.  <br>  2-"It was a common practice on fighter planes to load every 5th round with a tracer round to aid in aiming. This was a mistake."  This statement shows ignorance of how armament was used, and air/air combat in general.  Firstly, tracers work by having a very small amount of chems in the base of the projectile that burn during flight.  There is essentially no ballistic difference between these-in fact there would be more between AP and Ball ammo than tracer.  "At long range" is meaningless as nearly all guns were harmonized to impact at a single distance. Scoring went up, not due to not using tracers (of which I've NEVER found an instance in my anecdotal research) but actually due to harmonizing guns to impact at 100-150M.<br>  3- Ft Douaumont. It WAS infiltrated by a single German NCO, but he didn't "take the fort". He went back and informed his battalion commander who immediately organized an assault. It was taken because the French had decided to pull back (the fort was essentially useless due to German bombardment) and only left a small screening force.<br>  EDIT:  one more="the first American serviceman killed was killed by the Russians (Finland 1940)". This statement conflates (a typical Urban Legend tactic) serving American volunteers in the Finnish Army with "Servicemen".  <br>  Actually there several hundred Finnish-American and Swedish-American volunteers in the Winter War. However, NONE were "American Servicemen".  That statement implies that active duty US military were serving in Finland-not true. In order to go, just like with the AVG one would have to be discharged from the US military-THEN volunteer.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Try Snopes.com for urban legends.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=world+war+ii&sp-a=00062d45-sp00000000&sp-advanced=1&sp-p=all&sp-w-control=1&sp-w=alike&sp-date-range=-1&sp-x=any&sp-c=100&sp-m=1&sp-s=0" rel="nofollow">http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=wor...</a>|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	An "Urban Legend" by its very nature CANNOT be true.  If it was true it would not be a "legend."<br>  <br>  For instance, Japan's top ace was shot down and killed by a US fighter pilot flying a new F6F Hellcat which he mistook for the old F4F Wildcat.  In a vertical chase the Wildcat would stall well before the Japanese "Zero" and the Japanese pilots would shoot them down as they fell.

The suburbanites got labor from the illegals that they couldn't get elsewhere at an affordable price. They were conflicted between the convenience of that and the illegality.<br>  Changing times mean that legitimate citizens who once shunned manual labor will be obliged to go back to what their forebears took for granted.<br>  We have seen bubbles burst in high tech and in real estate. The bubble that is bursting now is that of wildly exaggerated expectancies of society at large.

All that they are doing is bringing our lifestyle down to their level
lvBUl3Zdaa	I love what he is doing to the Republican party. <br>  <br>  He has repeatedly clarified that he wants not only Obama to fail, but he wants the country to fail, which is exactly what will happen if Obama's policies fail.

zqPjdhgKaa	Not really, but it has occurred in the past.  One of my former coworkers was a probation officer and was bumped back to detention because she pissed off the chief juvenile officer at the time.  I was hired when our facility was more punitive, but after about a year or so we started reforming and joining the Ann E. Casey Foundation (Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative) and a lot of changes occurred at our facility, such as getting a rid of lock downs for most situations and implementing 5 minute timeouts in corners...  making a long story short, those that were against the reform and were very vocal about it were sort of pushed out and eventually quit.  I was lucky because even though I was against the changes at first, I wasn't as vocal about it.|`|wYiaokysaa	She may have been asked to down size.

I'd only vote for him if they had a voting booth with his picture and you cast your vote for him by pushing the red dot on Jindals forehead.|`|di43MlSFaa	According to the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, all that is required to become a member of the Executive Branch of Louisiana is   <br>  "by the date of his qualification as a candidate, shall have attained the age of twenty-five years, be an elector, and have been a citizen of the United States and of this state for at least the preceding five years." <br>  <br>  Being born in the United States with one or more parents as a US citizen is a requirement for being President, but being born in or out of the United States is not a requirement for holding office in Louisiana. Just being a citizen of the US and that State for five years is required.  <br>  Since Mr. Jindal has not stated he is going to run for President in 2012, there is no reason for him to produce a birth certificate or anyone questioning if he was born in India or in Louisiana in 1971.  Not until he is on the ticket for the Presidential run will any of that matter. <br>  I'm not Republican and would not vote for Mr. Jindal regardless, but just think it's unnecessary to ask for documentation when he hasn't stated he's going to run for President in 2012.<br>  <a href="http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov/elections/elect-qualify.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov/election...</a>|`|7ONKVbbiaa	It really does not matter....<br>  When we have freaking stupidity that actually BELIEVES that birth certificates and medical records are all open to anyone who wants them.. <br>  AND they are STILL CONVINCED that the only records in the country that "got sealed" are Obama's... <br>  <br>  We have bigger problems in this country than we thought.|`|AEtGbSs6aa	Sure, its not sealed like Obama's...Im sure you can find his medical records and college thesis also..he didnt seal those either!<br>  <br>  PS...lets actually wait until hes running for President to be asking these questions|`|7y6yfrQlaa	he has yet to present his birth cert so no i will not vote for him|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	The guy's amazing, not a clown.

The biggest temples report all collections to the government and the government is taking a part of these collections. The temple priests are on measly salaries. How will you justify the Daughter of an Ex President KR Narayanan taking admissions in medical college based on an OBC reservation. This is the truth. Do you think an Ex President's family is a disadvantaged lot?<br>  <br>  Edit: Upper Castes as the term is used in India do not have any reservations whatsoever whether they are industrialists or priests or rickshaw wallahs. BC/OBC is identified by the constitution for certain castes but in none of the states do upper castes come under any of these categories. So either your premise is flawed or you are intentionally mixing things up to misrepresent facts! But it's the latter, I think a case of dissemination because you talk constantly of destroying caste and then class barriers, though you have suggested elsewhere to use the BC/OBC for this so called revolution. It's a regular case of communist verbal diarrhoea and as usual a constipation of thought.|`|XQYD48MYaa	Tell me one thing that govt did properly. Reservations is also one failed govt policy.

So I guess expanding these departments with funding and jobs does increase his control. Just a little.<br>  <br>  Obama has also changed who the census director reports to. Yes, the director now reports to Obama instead of the Commerce Secretary, which was the case under the Bush Administration.

Considering the size of the deficit when he left office, his involvement with the Iran-Contra scandal, and the fact that the disparity between rich and poor increased during his eight years.<br>  Ronnie also cut and run in beirut after the Marine barracks was bombed along with the treason on negotiating with iranian terrorists and selling them weapons.<br>  Ronald Reagan also happened to have raised taxes on everyone (except the top 1%) for the last 7 of his 8 years in office. The tax rates during Reagan's entire time in office were higher than the tax rates during the entire time Clinton was in office.<br>  The biggest expansion of government occurred in 2002, done by a Republican Congress and approved by Republican President George W. Bush (who came up with the legislation in the first place, mind you).<br>  I was also in California when he was Governor. One of the things he did there was closed up a lot of mental hospitals, and put people out on the street. This was at a time when there were a lot of Viet Nam Vets were addicted to drugs and had mental depression. He spent all that money on the Star Wars project that was never used. He didn't break up the Soviet Union. They bankrupted themselves. the same way we almost did then. But thanks to GWB we may now. I am so tired of people that were too young to have been there, talking as if he was some kind of a God. <br>  Reagan was a half azz actor and President.  Boy, did he fool some of you people.<br>  <br>   Throwback518…. Your ignorance is indeed a disease and so is being na?ve. Then again it could be youth.  Reagan didn’t really do anything to boost our economy. All of our banks giving everyone a credit card so that they could spend money that they didn’t have has kept our economy going for the last 30 years. The credit card did more than anything else. I know, I was there.<br>   Bill Clinton gave us the best 8 years of our life.  Bill also gave us the 3 time loser bill, he Balanced the Budget, the Brady Bill, 100.000 Policeman, Family and Medical Leave Act, Assault Weapons Ban, Violent Crime Control, The Law Enforcement Act, part of an omnibus crime bill, the federal death penalty was expanded to some 60 different offenses and don’t you forget Welfare Reform and the list goes on and on.  No other President for the last 50 years can even  come close to match all of the accomplishments that this man has made for our country. I do agree with you on Obama.|`|de711i5Vaa	He is the best and the reason the loons attack him is because they know he made the Dems look like idiots while he was in office.|`|VBdXray0aa	Reagan was voted the most important American ever.

It is six weeks long and you will be sleep deprived, not able to eat much at all, constantly screamed at, a ton of P.T. March drills for hours each day and so on. You will not be able to write letters home for the first few weeks most likely(depending on you MTL). So, do not count on being in good contact with you loved ones during BTM. It is a challenge. <br>      But the brighter side of things, If you do join the military You will most likely enjoy the Air Force the most. If i remember correctly I had to wait until I graduated Tech school before I got those 12 days, but you do get them.

And, after talking with friends of mine who have gone through BMT it doesn't sound that physically demanding either.  And, as for the letters you can send home as many as you can write.<br>  <br>  Note:  Since you'll be able to send letters as much as you like after your first few weeks. You'll want to make sure you get everyones address and phone numbers before you leave.  That's one of the things I most regret when I did boot myself.  <br>  <br>  Also,  it is important to pay attention and take care of your body during boot.  Blisters, shin splints and fractures are very common injurys.  Preventive measures before leaving and while are get your body accustomed to excercise espeically running to prevent shin splints, and get proper calcium intake with foods and supplements to prevent developing fractures.  Since you will be breaking in a new pair of boots you'll want to bring your own footpowder and moleskin.  You should apply the footpowder regularly it'll absorb the moisture and reduce the friction. And, this should be done as often as you can accompanied by a fresh pair of socks.  That's something to expect.  Best of luck, I bet your recruiter didn't tell you this either. haha

You can take online correspondence courses when you get assigned to your unit, and there are online charts for pay. You can choose either to get paid bi-weekly or monthly as well. Since you are in the ANG, you might be better off taking college courses in the army at the same time.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions about your MOS as well, feel free to ask.|`|8Gcyr0T1aa	You get paid on the 1st and 15th of every month. Pay depends upon time served, I'm guessing you havn't yet served so it will be the lowest an E3 can be paid. Google 2009 pay charts. You will get a little more (BAH) if you are married. And yes, you can go back to AIT later down the line.

Again this is something you will get while you are at BCT/AIT but it will stop once you graduate. You will NOT get BAH for when you go to drills. It is only paid when you are on ACTIVE status.

esOaJoqBaa	There is a chance that you could get a waiver for it. It probably depends on how much of it will show in uniform. They have been getting a lot stricter about tats lately, so I can't give a definite answer, you would have to talk to a recruiter.<br>  USMC uniforms have collars that sit higher than a t-shirt so I would guess that not much of it would show, so it should not be a problem.|`|f153f5c587854a64f0b19f95ee388282aa	Ehh...it's a little more elaborate than I thought. You can generally get a waiver for tattoo's on the arms/legs which would be visible on the uniform. They tend to, however, be a little more strict on the neck on up. I doubt you could get a waiver for that - it would have to be removed. Check with your recruiter though, if there's a waiver for it...they'll find it.|`|5XY5rF4Jaa	You'd really have to talk to your local recruiter.<br>  I know a guy in the Marines that has a tattoo that runs all the way down to his hand and is visible in uniform.

DhqWBZOKaa	Certain programs have their place; those that help strictly those with no other way possible.<br>  <br>  Of course, what should be an overriding negative in the US is that the country just plain cannot afford the social programs they have, let alone those to be added.<br>  <br>  (that junk about the conservatives taxing the poor is utter nonsense, just as liberal promises to tax only the wealthy are.  Both sides overtax everyone, and taxing only the wealthy {the capital providers and risk takers} who already pay the majority is stupid.  Punishing success makes no sense.)<br>  <br>  The liberal ideal for the well off (not that in practice, the right isn't usually complicit) has an underlying ugly current.  Besides leading down the road to socialism, it amounts to removing all responsibility from the 'haves' for the 'have-nots' while making them *feel* as if they're actually helping.  It's their "let's turn all the money over to the government to take care of the problems" attitude, when everyone knows that governments are the most inneficient, wasteful, bureaucratic monstrosities on the planet.  And, it's those 'haves' that make up entities which can lobby and tweak the system to shift the burden to the middle class.<br>  <br>  Obviously, the liberal ideal as it relates to the 'have-nots' is bad because once the programs are in place, for them it becomes "gotta vote liberal or my aid will go away".  They're beholden, and fearful and will remain that way, because the programs are *never* going to themselves be enough to get those people out of poverty, yet without them, they have nothing.|`|NxGqxsBvaa	I've never put myself into a liberal or conservative category.  Part of what you have said is correct, but a lot of it is based on assumptions and/or hearsay.<br>  <br>  Many that are recipients of the social programs are unemployable or not capable of helping themselves.  For instance NO insurance company is going to sell health insurance coverage to those over 65 at an affordable cost, if at all.  <br>  <br>  But anyway after reading the response from BASH, to explain it any better would be futile on my part.  He really knows what he's talking about.|`|BxQEFUwIaa	welfare is supposed to help people who are unable to work or are in between jobs, its not for people to live off of. you should not expect the government to supply you with everything you need for your whole life, but there are plenty of other countries that will do that for you anyway (france, canada) i say move there if you dont feel like working, but stop living off other people's money in our country|`|UgOx2Gxiaa	A lot of people have just giving up on trying <br>  <br>  When you try ,it can make you ineligible for help<br>  <br>  If you give up completely & just Quit<br>  <br>  They can give you the world <br>  <br>  This is a lot of the Problem<br>  <br>  Help people who are trying <br>  To help them self's<br>  <br>  And there would be less <br>      ABUSE|`|b910713dceb8a16719f1f72a174818c9aa	Welfare is only useful for short time periods.

Your question really sound hypocritical to me.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Sure thing. Social programs pay for 27 million of our Veterans to receive basic medical care. Social programs like welfare pay for our temp. unemployed and their medical care, for our seniors who had no access to pensions, 401k's, and retirement accounts. Social programs like welfare pay for my 3 foster children, who have no parents, to receive basic food staples and medical care. There are 3 million foster children in this nation....and a quarter of a million of our Veterans are homeless in America.<br>  Since none of these people CAN work...due to old age, disability, or being children, they are not able to be self-reliant at this stage. But, obviously you should know that our VA and medicare/medicaid can treat people, can provide prosthetics, so that people CAN become self-reliant. My foster children won't starve to death on the streets. They will receive $52 per month for ALL of their food. It isn't nearly enough, but it allows us the absolute bare necessities to care for them, so that they can have both love and stability, and so that they can grow and develop into healthy, well adjusted adults who can be both self-reliant and productive.<br>  EDIT: Here's the problem, Bryan. You somehow believe that liberals support rewarding the lazy. We don't. YOU don't. We are all in FULL agreement. Instead of whining and complaining about a tiny fraction of the people on social welfare who are using OUR tax dollars fraudulently, why not report those people. There are federal and state agents in EVERY branch awaiting your call to report fraud. OUR tax dollars are paying them....so, by NOT reporting fraud cases, you are not only allowing cheaters to use OUR tax dollars, but you are also using this one group of people as your 'reason' why 'welfare' is awful. You are also allowing OUR tax dollars to be wasted on agents who have nothing to do....as you haven't called them to report anyone. It is a VERY simple solution....but no one seems to want to do the right thing.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	Now that you only get 2 years lifetime thanks to Clint for welfare I think it does.

The majority of those who are on it, against their own choice.. would be self reliant..IF THEY COULD. <br>  NONE of the programs are intended to make persons dependent on the govt. <br>  The saddest part? those who really do need help, being stigmatized and ridiculed by the actions of those who are taking advantage.<br>  edit<br>  and we won't even try to discuss the ignorant and abusive ideas of some persons here, who want to anyone of the Dem. party as being welfare bums.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Welfare was designed to keep people from becoming homeless.

Fossil fuels are out-dated and "green" technology is harmful to the economy and the environment. Finally, the current monetary system needs to be restructured, to match what is allowed by our Constitution.

If students didn't have to pay fee's ,  imagine how much more money they would have to spend. This would also allow more people to get the education they want or need. 3) Lower the income tax for those who earn bellow the average wage , this would allow these people to join the middle class and help raise the living standards across the whole country. 4) Get serious about illegal immigration , the statistics say there could be up to 25million illegal immigrants in the US now , that's a lot of new jobs. 5) The government should start building skyscrapers again like it did in the 70s , like the Twin Towers in New York. These projects create huge job numbers and spread wealth far.

iDCWOvVBaa	Navy for sure.<br>  <br>  Last branch I'd join is the Marine Corps if I was a girl.<br>  <br>  Better yet go Air Force... that is the best branch for women.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	For a Female, the Navy would be the wisest choice. The Marines is really tough and hard. You go through more physically and mentally in the Marines. The Marines boot camp is super hard on both the mind and body, worse for a female, let alone what it does to guys in the Marines.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	The boot camp is much easier in navy. I recomend speaking with all branches. Don't get caught up in the sales pitches.|`|oSHCPmiqaa	Go in the AF. They treat women better and allows them equal training. I was in the Navy for eight years and I faced unfair disadvantaged of  not getting advanced schooling in my job, not to mention alot of disrespectful senior supervisors treating women like crap. my opinion is way different from other female sailors, but the AF is better.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	I would give it a bit more time...like a year or so before you even try making up your mind.  I know you've been told this before but you're young.  The USMC is an excellent place to be if you're a guy...I can't speak about it from a female's point of view so you'd have to get advice elsewhere there.  Boot Camp in the Corps is hard but well worth it.  I loved the Corps and would do it again in a heart beat.<br>  <br>  Master Gunnery Sergeant, USMC, (Ret.)|`|2zym4J9xaa	Navy or Air Force!<br>  <br>  How many times are you going to ask this and then delete the question?|`|Dfq1cMOcaa	AF or navy... as a girl you can't be infantry... and there ain't much girl marines at all.. in the air force or navy there are a lot of girls in there, with really good jobs... don't go army though...<br>  <br>  boot camp is easiast in air force, and then navy, then army, then marines...<br>  <br>  You will have a greater risk of dying in the marines rather then navy or air force....|`|QZ6qfmKnaa	what kind of advice are you looking for?|`|Za3iJC3paa	AIR FORCE :o) <br>  <br>  k but since you're between the Marines or the the Navy let me point a couple of things out. <br>  <br>  I assume that since you're joining, you are strong and can hold your own. So whichever way you choose, you HAVE to be strong and push HARD!!! Keep on pushing til you've pulled 10 more from "I don't know where" So to shame these men who think you shouldn't do it because its too challenging...whatever haha. <br>  <br>  BUT...the Marines ARE hard core, and women in the Marines face a lot more discriminatory challenges then they would in say the air force and a little less in the Navy as well. Coast Guard and marines are the worst for this "legal discrimination". Such as "women do not qualify for this position" or "women are only allowed to attend BC at this location..." <br>  <br>  The Navy, however, makes it very difficult to have a family. I don't know if this is a goal for you..but please remember! Any service you sign will initially be active for 4 years and in the reserves for 4 years and many of my friends have been called out on their reserves more than twice! Make sure you realize that when you deploy in the Navy it is so far from reality and though you would be taking ten steps forward towards career, you would also be taking 10 steps back in love, life, etc! <br>  <br>  You're 16. You seem intelligent and show the ability to use your resources to find the proper answer. You will know the answer and feel it is right in you heart! Follow that throbbing feeling but first evaluate what you can see you want from life right now! I'm sure you'll make the right choice just be careful who you lean on for support hunni! Some people only want to bring you down! You're totally in for a grand experience! I wish you the best of luck

They may be willing to tell you. <br>  <br>  You could also try one of the people search sites. I have bought a report from ussearch.com - it was pretty complete & I think you can search by address.  <br>  <br>  You could try contacting the local post office closest to that address & ask for the persons name. <br>  <br>  You could demand (and I say demand b/c although this is public record, the police are often very difficult to get this information from) the call history for that address.  You DO have a right to this information, it's just that the police dept is not used to filling these requests for individuals; but many times they regularly release this information to the media. <br>  <br>  You could probably also hire a local detective (in Indiana) to get you a tenant history for that address...I would bet it wouldn't cost that much. <br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck.  I know the inertia that goes along with these cases. There are just too many of these crimes & they are not pursued unless the answer is just lying in plain sight.|`|FUpjkAowaa	Call the local police and tell them the address,  if that doesnt work, look up & call that cities police department.

f153f5c587854a64f0b19f95ee388282aa	Eat more - fat turns into muscle with proper exercise. Include plenty of protein in this increased diet otherwise you're just wasting your time.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if you just eat more and do not commit to a good exercise routine, you will just get fat. It's a lot harder for a scrawny guy to build muscle in comparison to someone with a little "extra weight" on them.<br>  <br>  56kg = 123lbs, 1g of protein per pound (lb) at least.<br>  Include at least 123g of protein during workout days...if it's heavy training, even more.<br>  <br>  You can also, since you are trying to gain weight, include more meals per day - roughly seven. Not full course meals per say, but rather something to keep your metabolism going. Maybe include a "fourth" meal and snack on something with a good amount of carbs and/or protein inbetween them.|`|T3OGT4Ntaa	Start on a balanced diet with plenty of protein, take a good multivitamin, and train regularly and faithfully.  Push-ups, running, sit-ups and crunches, leg lifts, running, pull-ups and negative pull-ups, cycling, running, swimming, squats, lunges, and more running.|`|5BGKQM7naa	Go to the website I think its<br>  www.defencejobs.org<br>  and see what you need to be able to be able to do to get in But don't push yourself too hard, get someone to help you if you've never worked out before|`|QAsWwWvFaa	Dude you need to hit the gym, and you need to eat a LOT of carbs and protien. I was 6'1 and weighed 121, 2 years later im 6'1 and 185lbs, all of which is pure muscle. <br>  <br>  Get on a set workout where you do strength training 3 days a week and cardio 2. Eat a lot of carbs, and protien. Eggs, steak ect.  Just remember that if you do a whole bunch of cardio and no strength training your just getting smaller, but you need the cardio to burn off the carbs. So dont think that youll be able to do one but not the other.<br>  <br>  Alright I had to re-edit this because all the people above are saying do situp and pushups and running... No no no no.. Thats how you get fit, not bigger. You need strength training. By that I mean go to the gym and do 3 days a week, 1 chest 1 shoulders and 1 legs. Everyday you do abs. Every machine that you go on you need to max out. 3 sets, start somewhere kinda easy to get warmed up. somewhere streinous, and then the 3rd set you should only be able to do 2 or 3 reps of cause your arm or leg just straight gives out. DONT go in there and do 1 easy 1 easy mediocore and 1 kinda streinous. Thats endurance, thats getting fit, thats not how you build mass. AND REMEMBER EAT ALOT.. What you eat now, you need to double that, but nothing with a lot of fat or trans fat or high sugar. Eat good smart healthy food.

As a good neighbor you should be doing everything possible to keep your dog from annoying your neighbors.  That is the neighborly thing for you to do.  If you cant keep your pet under control you should get rid of it.<br>  <br>  There are things that you could have done.  Try using a bark collar.  It does not appear that you are one who cares much for anyone other than yourself.<br>  <br>  There are people who work different shifts and need their time to rest as much as you do.<br>  <br>  As for photographing your dog during an annoying session of disturbing the piece they are just taking the next step.  That of documenting the the problem that you should have resolved on your own.<br>  <br>  The only alternative that your neighbors have to get control of the situation that you have ignored and shown little to no consideration for is to work toward ridding themselves of the problem.

I know that when a parking ticket is not paid that when the ticket gets to a certain amount (say 500 dollars of unpaid ticket charges) whenever your car is parked on a city street the parking authority will be traveling around typing in plate numbers in a computer. Then if and when they catch your car they will TOW IT. And then you have to pay the ticket AND pay a tow fee AND pay everyday it was held in the impound lot.<br>  And if you dont pay then, say cause you dont have the money. 30 Days after they tow your car and it isnt paid for they will PUT YOUR CAR UP FOR PUBLIC AUCTION! And it will be sold for as high as they can get!<br>  <br>  For a speeding ticket it will also have an extra charge added to it daily for not paying. And you could lose your license.

You only have yourself to blame for the consequences!|`|GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions.

People who write books put a lot of time and effort creating them and they are owed for that product just as you would pay for a cake a the bakery that was made from scratch.  The way that authors make their money is on the purchases of their books, called royalties.  Every time you download something for free without permission from the author you are stealing from him/her no different than if you stole money from someone on the street.  My advice, pay for it or go to a library and read it where it has been purchased by the community.

YOu also got to look at the types of jobs Hispanics work in and the areas they work.   California has one of the highest unemeployment rate and also has one of the highest numbers of Hispanics.   This fact alone would cause Hispanics to lose jobs at a higher rate than other ethnicities.   A disproportionate percent of the Hispanics work in the construction industry, and the construction industry is hit the hardest.  That means that the Hispanics would cause a skew in the numbers.   Also you have to understand racism from the Hispanic community may also be causing the discrepency on the numbers.   Certain ethnic groups tend to work in certain industries.   This is sometimes caused by racism giving preference to your on race in hiring in that industry.  I have seen it in the computer industry where there are two groups of factory workers.  Hispanic only and South East Asian, and there was only one factory I know off that actualy has a mix of race (Kingston).  .     TO get hired in these factories you have to "know" someone.   When there is a recession and that industry is hit,  it would show a disporportionate number of a particular race being layed off, because if these factories only employ hispanics, they can only layoff Hispanics.   I was told that such racist hiring is going on in the construction industry.   Hispanic rights group harrass and blackmail companies to hire a disporportionate number of Hispanics.   Also as the article noted, income is a factor, and Hispanics are hit harder, because they typically are poorer.|`|BKNT0tz5aa	Nothing says that blacks and hispanics are laid off at those rates. The chart is a tally of the people that they talked to that said they felt that they might be laid off.

What does this mean.|`|c5a80b54427d403df08bd924a7e11fc6aa	They get preferred hiring, it's only logical that since they are hired at a faster rate, they would be fired at a faster rate.  For non-minorities to be hired they have to be good at what they do, for minorities to be hired, race plays a big part.  When you lay someone off, you lay off the least productive people.  So, are you going to lay off the token that you hired, or the guy that earned it?  If anyone doesn't like what I am saying, then they should oppose affirmative action.|`|9P3uKmPlaa	Yeah man, Obama hates black people and hispanics.

The problem isn't all racist. <br>  <br>  Example: My Hispanic stepfather was unable to find a job for four months because construction was down - due to the housing crisis. 90% of the other men who work in his field of construction & labor are Hispanic. I know a Caucasian guy who works in the medical industry that continues to get a steady stream of clients because, well, most people need health care regardless of the economy. <br>  <br>  Before the recession 50% of all black males in liberal minded New York City were unemployed. There's got to be something cultural going on - not just racism.<br>  <br>  Edit: No need to be snappy, my dear. Political jabs will suffice. Here's the information on black men in New York. The stats were also reported in the NYT. It may not be comfortable but unless we talk about race and stop this perspective of perpetual victim hood then how will the situation improve ? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blackcommentator.com/83/83_freedom_rider_black_nyc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackcommentator.com/83/83_fr...</a>

Not military personnel. Go around the states, and you will witness veterans who are homeless. People who went to war to fight for their country are ending up homeless. Did a penny of that trillion Dollars helped a veteran get back on his feet?. No.<br>  <br>  I think this what government should understand. You need to sustain a powerful military, you invest on the people, not JUST hardware. America builds a high tech military hardware, equipments that may NEVER BE used in a real combat. Combat zones changes, enemies adopt to a new tactics. When you fight them a tank today, tomorrow they will learn a way to fight that tank anyway, without ever building a single hardware to compete your military strength. Look at the B-2's, very expensive and most likely will all retire before all of them are ever used in a real combat, except for simulations. <br>  <br>  Investing on the people that CREATE the powerful country is the answer. Pay for their college tuition, create a variety of degrees besides the Associate, Bachelors and Masters or the Ph.D's and fund the math and science subjects more than anything else. This is the main two subjects that can be mastered in order to master technology and develop. You can't send 18 year old in the military, and when left all he/she knows is how to operate an M16 or a tank.

It takes little research to see that police corruption is rampant in the US. Bet you didn't know that the CIA is the largest importer of illegal drugs into this country.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of what I'm talking about...<br>  <a href="http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/mafia.cops.sentenced.2.952251.html" rel="nofollow">http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/maf...</a><br>  <br>  A wise man once said "The more laws and taxes are accessed, the more law breakers and tax evaders there are"  Ever stop to consider that maybe that's the plan?<br>  <br>  Over recent decades, police agencies have adopted increasingly invasive and controversial police tactics, which turn innocent citizens into suspects. Concurrently, the Supreme Court has usually ruled in favor of expanding the scope of police power -- especially for the purpose of fighting illegal drugs.<br>  <br>  One of the most disturbing consequences of this apparent "drug exception to the Constitution" has been the use of racial profiling to determine which drivers will be stopped for minor traffic offenses in order to be searched for contraband.<br>  <br>  In 2001, Congress's hasty passage of the USA Patriot Act further eroded constitutional protections of the people's privacy and liberty.<br>  <br>  Sustaining the erosion of traditional constitutional rights is a complicit citizenry, which has become dangerously permissive of everyday abuses of police power. For example, most people during the course of a traffic stop are likely to waive their rights without even knowing it.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, these trends are neither inevitable nor irreversible.<br>  <br>  The following answers are an indication of just what I'm talking about.

This shows his severe lack of business acumen.  he doesn't get it.  The industries of the future will be created in garages and funded by people who make 250-500k.

Sg1h0ecpaa	She needs to understand that military life is hard. There will be times that she is separated from her husband for months at a time, times that she can't see her family for months at a time - either because of money or lack of opportunity, and it isn't going to be easy. She's going to have to learn to be stong and independent, and she's going to have to step up and be an adult. My husband was an E4 when we got married, and I can tell you what she's looking at - periods of no money, lots of money, loneliness, happiness, stress, and joy -you have to be prepared to take care of yourself when your husband is gone, and you have to be prepared to step up and be a wife. If he's whining about getting out of the military, it isn't going to make life any easier - him being miserable is going to lead to her being miserable. You have to choose to be happy regardless of your situation or location. We aren't a fan of where we are living, but we're happy because we choose to make the best of things. If she doesn't make that decision, she's going to be miserable and unable to handle things. At the same time, you have to give her the chance to be an adult and make her own decision - she's going to have to step up, be a wife, and do the cooking, laundry, etc...and if she chooses to do that, her life can be what she makes of it. My advice is - support her, do your best to make her see that life will be hard, and help her to understand that she's going to have to be her own person and be able to be on her own in this new life she's planning. <br>  <br>  From my husband: If he's already crying about being in the military after his first duty station, his first duty station is going to see that attitude, and he may not make it in the military long, which means that they're going to be broke. Good luck to them.|`|AA10980983	Im not an AF wife,but my husband is in the military and for most of his career he has been deployed.It is not easy and it is definitely NOT for weak people or those who dont like to be alone.<br>  Military personnel dont make "bank",but it is a decent living.Not rich by any means.I dont know what kind of person your sister is,but you wont be able to talk her out of anything anyway,because 19 is an age where when you look out for someones best interest and give them advice,a lot of time they feel like youre telling them what to do so they will do quite the opposite.Its good that she has someone to look out for her.<br>  If her guy had some college he may sign in as an E-3,there are alot of things that could depend on.<br>  Good Luck to you and her  and God Bless!|`|UoAZLRG8aa	I have seen your sister many times, by that I mean I have seen her type.

She probably doesn't know how to cook so they will live on pizza and burgers to the point where they will wind up so deep in debt that they will be close to, if not in, bankruptcy.

She should hold off on going to be with him until he makes E4... If he can get promoted he might just be worth the trouble... The hardest part will be getting hit on by other servicemen... Also the pay is not that great for young service men...  he will barely have enough for himself; even after adding in the bachelors allawance for quarters (if you have to live off base) and the subsistence allowance for meals that you get for being married.  <br>  <br>  I am a retired Marine and speak from experience.|`|AA10709853	yes he could have gone in as an E3 depending on certain criteria.  as for the rest of it: what is she going to do when he deploys?   and if he is in school down in FL guess what.. he ain't going to get permission to live off base even if they DO get married unless his schooling is longer than 6 months long.   .  <br>  <br>  being a military spouse is HARD..  and being an E3 he won't be making the big bucks by any stretch of the imagination.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	Is he going to tech school in April in Florida? or is he going to be stationed there?, because that's two different situations...

But E3's don't break the bank by any means, lol. <br>  <br>  Being an AF wife isn't easy, but it's not awful if you are totally in love, and committed. Deployments are no fun, but rewarding in the end. I don't know your sister, but sometimes when people have NOTHING else to fall back on, they realize how important it is to be responsible. I think all you can do at this point is be honest, and tell her that you think it is a mistake, but let her make it. People don't usually learn from being told, they learn from experiencing things. A lot of women who marry military men are romanticized by the idea that they will be the wife who waits for their husband to come home, and flies into his arms in the airport when he returns from deployment. But they don't think about all of the lonely nights, lonely days, bills to pay, cars and lawns to maintain, in my case children to raise... It's not easy, but it's life. It's not any harder than being an adult. Everyone has something about their life that they dislike. We just chose what ours was going to be :o). Hope that helps a little!

In fact they wont know anything changed at all. <br>  <br>  if the visa is refused it is probably because you did not adequately prove that you will leave the country at the end of your visit|`|Jm3vMKx3aa	Multiple entry visa for Canada allows you to enter Canada several times during the period while your visa is valid. A multiple-entry visa is valid for a maximum of five years or one month prior to the expiry date on the passport/re-entry visa, whichever is earlier.<br>  <br>  With a visit visa you can usually enter and leave the UK any number of times while it is still valid. The Entry Clearance Officer may occasionally limit a visa so it is valid for only one entry. You cannot stay for longer than six months on each visit. Visit visas can be valid for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 5 years. It is recommended to apply for a 6 month visa if you are applying for a UK VISA for the first time.<br>  <br>  You cannot stay in both countries after the visa expiration date, hence if you hold a visa that is valid until March 15 you may still enter the country but only stay for less than a week since your visa would be expired then.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/faq/visit/visit-faq01.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.vfs-uk-za.com/faqs.aspx#18" rel="nofollow">http://www.vfs-uk-za.com/faqs.aspx#18</a>

IPl3Yh1kaa	I'm not a McCain supporter, but I think its sad when people think that they are above being at the bottom. I know someone personally who worked @ Lehman Brothers. Wonderful job, excellent benefits. Lived in NYC just like me. He was living a nice comfortable NYC lifestyle (which we all know is inclusive of dinner, shows, and 'hot' nightlife. Everything was going beautifully. He had his retirement invested in the company, nice 401K, & it was all dandy. A few weeks ago you saw all those guys pack up their offices with nowhere to go, accounts depleted. So even with all the money saved, and all the finances in order, and NO faulty loans, all of a sudden a hardworking person is out & financially susceptible. God forbid he gets sick. All im saying is you never know what will happen so it would behoove of anyone to not ever be high & mighty about people they consider 'lazy'...life is not so black and white|`|lEaT5q06aa	poverty is not a big deal<br>  been there and done that<br>  no medical insurance at all until 1950's <br>  and people lived just fine without government assistance<br>  rising above poverty is a matter of individual work, <br>  and it involves generations of work<br>  socialism freezes the social structure where it is at<br>  if in free market, rising above initial station is possible<br>  in socialism it is impossible<br>  and in socialism all live more poorly, just a narrower range|`|gTpOTYFvaa	Stop the fraud of ACORN:  You're telling conf to get an education?<br>  <br>  Go to a McCain/Palin rally and give the same helpful advice to Sarah Palin.  6 different schools to get a degree in... laugh... journalism?  She makes George W.  Bush look like a rocket scientist.<br>  <br>  Only in America...<br>  <br>  Concerning ANYTHING economical, McCain/Palin will be a disaster.  Palin for obvious reasons as she'd propose that we have a nationwide bake sell to raise money for health care.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like the idea that Americans have an opportunity to get the same health care as our elected officials.  We pay their salaries, after all.  <br>  The "boss" rarely has a worse health care option than the "employee".|`|RsDZu7iNaa	oh please, with all the programs, grants, and loans available, you silly Obamabots still want to blame your own failures on others. Get a life son, and an education.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	Slash medicae and Medicaid?  Link please... oh wait you can't provide one because it isn't true.  What McCain is proposing is a freeze on spending  Which means no NEW expenses and no INCREASES in funding.  And what do you think  the health care system is like now?  McCains plan is BETTER because it allows businesses to write off their health care expenses (enabling more of them to provide insurance)  Yes it increases the workers taxable income but the 5K credit that McCain's plan allows for individuals will negate that. Obama's plan will force people to uy insurance... the ONLY thing that that will do is make insurance comapnies stronger (hey AIG just had to be bailed out.... WTF?)  Yes it is true that most people with dead end jobs are there for a reason.....<br>  <br>  Edit... People don't get paid medicaid... hopitals and nursing homes do (same with medicare) so a freeze on spending does NOT affect individuals.|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	I know I am going to get blasted for this one but here it goes:<br>  <br>  YES, it is the fault of individuals if they find themselves in these situations (in most cases).  The majority of people that are poor have reasons for their economic condition which include a lack of education, poor financial handling, or a lack of planning for the future.  The concept that people have to "keep up with the Joneses" is prevelant in the US.  People think they have to have a car, a cell phone, a computer, the internet, designer clothes and shoes, and so forth.  Very few people today want to work toward a goal in the future.  Instead they think they should have it now.  <br>  <br>  The housing crisis is a perfect example.  The standard was that a person needed a 20% down payment to buy a house.  This ensured the lender and the homeowner that they had the financial means to pay for the home and for the upkeep.   The government insisted that financial institutions make loans more accessible and they did with no down payment and interest only loans.  Homeowners could have resisted the temptation to make these bad loans but gobbled them up quickly.  Many of these same people are now in foreclosure because of their bad decisions.  Don't blame the lenders.  They only offered the product.  They didn't force anyone to sign the loan documents.<br>  <br>  Lazy people do not make up all of the population of seniors and not all of seniors find themselves without a "life raft".  Many seniors failed to plan for their own future and expected the government to take care of them as they got older with Social Security and Medicaide.  Leaving the plans to the government makes them responsible (at least in part).  Those that didn't count on the government and saved throughout their lives are not without their "life raft".  They planned for the means to take care of themselves in these cases.<br>  <br>  The blame lies in two places: the government and society.  The government has continued to create more entitlement programs since the depression and society has become more reliant on these entitlement programs instead of taking care of themselves.  The only way to change the situation is to slowly ween society off of the entitlement programs so that people are once again self-sufficient.<br>  <br>  MOST of McCain's programs are entitlement programs too.  He just packages them different than Obama.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  There are some legitimate people that are in predicaments not of their own making.  The percentage of legitimate people receiving entitlement funds is small.  Consider the amount of help the legitimate ones could receive if there weren't as many "lazy" people taking the resources from both government programs and social service programs.|`|87OtFPzbaa	yes,most of the time.I used to be really bad off and now i'm not.I make money and i have a comfortable life.Nobody gave it to me,i had to make it happen myself.|`|MLsi9ENOaa	It is mind boggling to see so many in the working class continously vote against their economic interest.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	I don't think it's the government's responsibility to make sure everyone and their dog has health care.  Medicare and Medicaid are not going to be slashed.  I think you are over exaggerating a great deal.  What he plans on doing is taking care of the rift raft that have been draining all of the resources for no good reason and don't forget about all those illegal aliens who soak up a good bit of our tax dollars.  <br>  <br>  Yes, I do believe that many people are poor due to their own faults.  I was freakin poor and I decided to get off my *** and do something about it.  Why can't other people?  It's do-able.<br>  <br>  I don't really know what universe you live in but just about anyone gets treated if they are sick - no one is turned away.  I have a grandmother and a mother and father who are on Medicare and it seems to be working just fine.  Learn to play before you start tooting your horn please - it sounds pretty lame.|`|TzkV8Ivraa	seniors need to be taken care of but the millions of lazy welfare riding child factories should be forced to get a job or starve.<br>  you should do yourself a favor and look at McCain's record & Obamas record ( as thin as it may be ). stop getting your information from msdnc, cnn, abc, cbs and any other Obama fawning news outlet.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  vets for Obama: the working class are voting in their best interest. unless you can tell me how higher taxes & more government helps people who are working and self supporting. democrats use to be the working mans party- now its just the party of social programs paid for by the working man.|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	You first need to understand it is not the place of the federal government to provide these things to us.<br>  <br>  Ummm, yes I do.<br>  <br>  Very few people begin life with a fixed income sufficient to eliminate any need to work, yet most of us make it.<br>  <br>  For those who are able bodied, live within your means.<br>  <br>  Not everyone is going to graduate from working at McDonalds. Some people will produce more than others. What is it that prevents someone from improving themselves? <br>  <br>  Is it the family down the street who were fortunate and born into wealth? Or perhaps the person who worked hard all their life, put themselves through college and now holds a good job?<br>  <br>  It is a complete lie to suggest those who need health care in this country can not get it anyway. If you don't know that, you should.<br>  <br>  There is a fundamental difference here: I believe you are worth whatever you choose to be worth.<br>  <br>  You appear to believe something different.<br>  <br>  I am of course referring to economics, not anything else.<br>  <br>  Many of us are sick and tired of the entitlement mentality in this country. Young people with no job, or a minimum wage job starting families when they simply can not afford it, too irresponsible to finish high-school, yet here they are with a family to raise. And they stand there with their hand out.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day that is not why I support McCain, but you asked.<br>  <br>  I support McCain because we do not need this country to end up closer to socialism that it already is.<br>  <br>  I will do my part to stop the idiotic notion raising someone else taxes helps another person. I will fight the more stupid idea raising corporate taxes helps us, it hurts us, lmao. <br>  <br>  If you want socialized medicine, go to the UK or Canada, and prey you do not develop a life threatening illness once you clear 60.
RYQ3i0ZNaa	Both bottom-up and top-down wealth distribution schemes are important, and they have to work together for success to be achieved. <br>  <br>  This is especially true in the poorest areas of the world, but still true in rich countries. You need both.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Few wealthy people actually produce their own accrued abundance.  Inheritance, monopoly, or oligopoly generally are the sources of personal wealth.  Very often people of minimal to moderate earnings supply the labor to produce wealth.<br>  <br>  Essentially the "distribution" limits the access of labor to wealth.  Labor receives fixed arrangement or schedule of remuneration.  CEO's or owners of a business have flexible access to wealth generated by production.|`|X3Q5VEDjaa	What has happened, the rich have not invested their money in US.

I guess that's what you call bottom up.  Top down requires robbing someone to give to someone else.  It is dishonest.  Its not the governments place to chose who gets what, its better for everyone to have an opportunity to earn what they get, and decide to do what they wish with what they earn.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	Here's a good analogy...<br>  DEMOCRAT<br>  You have two cows. <br>  Your neighbor has none. <br>  You feel guilty for being successful.<br>  <br>  You push for higher taxes so the government can provide cows for everyone.<br>  <br>  REPUBLICAN<br>  You have two cows. <br>  Your neighbor has none. <br>  So?<br>  <br>  SOCIALIST<br>  You have two cows. <br>  The government takes one and gives it to your neighbor. <br>  You form a cooperative to tell him how to manage his cow.<br>  <br>  <br>  ...do you see how close the democrat and socialist example is?<br>  furthermore, we are not on the bottom, if you want to see that, go to Africa.|`|QH02h9REaa	Damn man. You got a good point there.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Some people feel that wealthy CEO's, who have run their businesses in the ground, are somehow more 'worthy' or have 'worked harder' than our seniors who put us through the depression and multiple wars, but who never had access to retirement, 401K's, and hefty pensions, and who now survive on less than $500 per month and medicare.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Your question is meaningless, as 'wealth' indicates those on top.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I am not a Republican, but I am conservative. I do not trust McCain. Political conversions during an election cycle always make me suspicious. My feeling about McCain is that he didn't earn his maverick label by accident. He has been on the wrong side of policy issues a bit too often for my liking. Early on in the race I decided to vote for a third party being unable to justify to myself a vote for McCain or Obama. After the Palin announcement I started to rethink my choice. Then an interesting thing happened. McCain came out in full support of the bailout. This shocked me right back into reality. First impressions are usually correct. I am voting third party. For those conservatives supporting McCain for whatever reason don't start crying foul if he wins the election and starts acting like maverick John McCain again. You get what you vote for.|`|6c738af4ac776343f2bc535bba7907ceaa	I think McCain tried to play fair but was not getting anywhere with that...sometimes you have to meet people on their own level...I don't think McCain enjoys doing this but he will do what's necessary...in fact I think everyone hates it, including Joe Biden...the only one having fun with playing dirty is Obama...|`|FcNRUA6Paa	More power to you, so are you voting Obama ?

And they have been doing this a long time now so remember how many fingers are pointing back at you when you point your one finger.<br>  <br>  Also, btw, when all this is going on, not one station actually says what obama's plan is. It is never explained so don't tell me it is about the issues. I have not seen one news source that has yet to explain to American people of how obama's plans are better unless it is a one liner that cannot be proven by unbiased experts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try watching the news tonight and count how many positive stories there are by your news source about a positive for McCain.<br>  <br>  We haven't even got to barry's campaign staff yet that has again, attacking ads but no substance to back up why his plan is better...all barack says is 4 more years...wow...what a great speaker.|`|Hhk78c5Gaa	Only a RINO (Republican in Name Only) would vote for Obama.

Lets face it, the seeds were planted in everyones mine before you even knew it.  Im a Democrate and always have been.  My main issue for not voting Dem this year is Bibical principals and what is plainly put before us.  If we were more inclinded to follow bibical principles and we claim we do as Christ followers no one would vote Obama-  Mr Mccain is older, yes but that should be the issue,  i have heard over and over that Palin has no experience,  but did that stop Obama from getting where he is? not in the least he is an excellent speaker, younger, not bad looking and comes across as a great family man.  But believe me he is speaking nothing new.  no change, no change, no change this can be expected.  You can expect change until we take control back from the politicians and demand that they follow the Peoples instructs on votes not there opinions of the situations.  the change needs to cove first from the control that these people have,  NOW do you really think they are going to place a bill in line or even suggest that their wages are cut, that they only vote for what the people are demanding no..this will never happen and if you dont start first by taking back the control that they have gained.  no promise any candidiate give you is worth more then the energy it took to speak.   How can a group of candidates tear each other a part with the sad truths and then expect you to follow the winner.  Doesnt make much sence does it.  For most young people that have never seen this year after year there hopes lie in Obama being the younger of the two he has more appeal.  Each candidate has his good and bad points, but for me not knowing how to read the further,  I will go by bibical principals that have more credibility than anything else and vote McCain...  It just had to put into words what life experience can show  you when you have issues as these.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	Obama said it from the start - McCain is an honorable man running a dishonorable campaign. And McCain should know better. He was the victim of a Bush smear not too long ago.<br>  <br>  The majority of Americans realize the McCain/Palin campaign has become desperate. They can't beat Obama on the issues so they're turning to the only thing that's worked for Republicans since Reagan - smear tactics. Thankfully, Americans have had enough negativity in the Oval Office for 2 lifetimes.<br>  <br>  Obama/Biden 2008 & 2012|`|3MM64geHaa	I am relieved that McCain finally started pointing out who Obama is. I wish he would point out his abysmal voting record, his lack of experience, his numerous lies and gaffes. His character is important. and his policies that punish the successful and reward the lazy are scary.

It's Republicans decrying deficit spending and after GW Bush doubled the entire pre-existing national debt in 8 years.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Not as badly as I do about having to pay Bush's trillions in Iraq, which was actually needless spending.<br>  <br>  Obama's spending actually has a good chance of working.  It pays people to make the infrastructure more efficient, saving businesses huge amounts of money as they no longer have to spend so much in gas (more efficient routes because of road building), nor having to spend so much to fix shipping fleets because they no longer hit potholes and damage the insides.<br>  <br>  They also have a new avenue of sales in online sales to people for which it was previously unavailable, as well as better communication for more efficiency and productivity, because of the new Internet broadband towers.<br>  <br>  At the same time, those workers get paid to do that work.  Then they can get things they need.  But the only place where they can get those things are in American stores.  American stores owned by American businessmen and staffed by American workers.<br>  <br>  Then those businesses make profit again, and can hire new people.  Then those employees now have money they can use to buy things they need at more American stores.  Then those businesses make profits, and investors start taking notice and begin investing again.  That provides even more money for hiring, and it just goes on from there.<br>  <br>  And Republicans are right, that government work is temporary; which means that this is not the Socialization they insist it is.  It is temporary work that goes away, but only after it has jumpstarted the economy and the private sector moving again.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As opposed to the trillions we spent in Iraq under Bush.  Bush did not want to raise the funds to pay for the war, so he had to borrow the money.  He did so at extremely high (and exponentially growing) interest rates.<br>  <br>  The $600 billion you are told about are only the cost of war operations.  It does not include the $500 billion stimulus package that Bush gave the Iraqis, nor does it include all the money we paid the various tribes to stop killing American soldiers.  And it does not include the immense interest we are paying on all three.<br>  <br>  Consider that when Bush got to office, he inherited a $4 trillion national debt from Bill Clinton, as well as a $400 billion federal budget surplus.<br>  <br>  When he left office, Bush left us with a nearly $11 trillion national debt, and a $500 billion budget deficit.<br>  <br>  That means that in 8 years, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE what ALL 42 of his predecessors needed 224 years to amass.  It also means that his final budget managed to lose nearly a trillion dollars when compared to Clinton's final budget.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But take heart.  Bush's stimulus plan for Iraq, the $500 billion for 12 million people, actually worked.<br>  <br>  Iraq is a political nightmare, now that it is under the control of Iran.  Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki (who is a Shiite) allied to the majority-Shiite Iran during his rebellion against the Sunni Saddam Hussein.  Now he maintains that alliance today, and won't let us use Iraq as a staging ground for intimidating Iran into backing off its nuclear ambitions.<br>  <br>  But while it is a political nightmare, Iraq is actually an economic powerhouse.  Its economy is producing multi-billion dollar surpluses, and has national healthcare for every individual who wants it.  And it was Bush's $500 billion for 12 million people that did that.<br>  <br>  Now Obama has a similar plan, but it spends only $787 billion for over 300 million people.  On a per capita basis, Obama is spending significantly less, and helping far more people.|`|6ogBfBmpaa	Your "question" is obviously another misguided and ill-informed comment from the young and impressionable child of two stubborn republicans.<br>  <br>  Whether you like it or not, Obama IS our president, and as an American, it is your duty to stand behind him no matter what decisions he makes, just like we've done the past eight years.<br>  <br>  If you are unhappy here, then please leave.|`|OoCbHnqFaa	Much better than what I had to pay for Bush to Provide healthcare to Millions of Iraquis while American citizens were being neglected.<br>  <br>  Much better than when Bush and the Republicans tried to feed us the crap that Global warming is junk science, but bible and faith based activities are fine.|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	I don't like where he is taking us and I hope his policies fail.

With the way my husband is going now, he will retire at 38 with a masters if not his phd, no school debt and 50% of his base pay plus medical and dental for the both of us.<br>  Doesn't sound to bad to me especially in this economic climate.<br>  It's worth thinking about.<br>  :-)|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	There are certain things that many people don't take into account when thinking about military retirements. You will get health care for life. There are many civilian jobs that do not offer health care after retirement. Think about it for a minute. How much do you think it will cost if you have to pay for it yourself when your over 50 or 60 years old? Most people will have significant health problems that would cost thousands or tens of thousands of dollars annually. With a retirement from the military, your cost would be hardly anything in comparison.<br>  <br>  Also if you retire from active duty with 20 years and enlisted when you were 18 your only going to be 38 when you get out. Think about that also. You will be receiving a retirement check PLUS be able to work a civilian job. Many people at my job are retired military so they are making 5 - 8 k a month plus the retirement check.<br>  <br>  If a person plans it right, retiring from the military is a smart decision.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Twenty years from now that figure of $4000.00 will be much higher, plus if you get a college degree while serving that will add to you resume. My nephew just retired after thirty years in the Navy. He gets his retirement check every month and has walked right into a very high paying HR position at a nationally know major corporation. Add in all the benies from the VA and he is sitting very pretty. Sucker just paid cash for a new fully loaded Cadillac STS.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	It depends on many factors all related to the opportunity costs of staying in 20 years. Primary among the factors would be Officer v Enlisted. And Job in the Military and Job in the Civilian world. <br>  Since an Officer is a leader and manager, his specific job in the military is much less important to his employment prospects in the civilian world than for an enlisted veteran who is often  trying to transfer his skills from his military occupation if he has any that directly transfer to the civilian world. <br>  Many of the occupations that hire enlisted veterans who don't have directly transferable skills such as law enforcement and fire depts have cut off ages of around 35 that preclude perfectly healthy retired military from applying.  A California Highway Patrolman makes almost 90,000 his first year and they give veterans preference and seek to hire veterans  but 35 is the cut off hiring age.  They also have even better benefits and retirement than the military. A retired pay that is 90% of base. <br>  <a href="http://www.chp.ca.gov/recruiting/osalary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chp.ca.gov/recruiting/osalary...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.chp.ca.gov/recruiting/advantage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chp.ca.gov/recruiting/advanta...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.chp.ca.gov/recruiting/oqualifications.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chp.ca.gov/recruiting/oqualif...</a><br>  For an Air Traffic Controller, the FAA does not hire beyond age 30, with the exception that retired military can be hired and then can work till age 56. This sets up a situation where if a military controller does not separate in his early years he must stay till retirement but then only has so many years he can work and will probably never make the kind of seniority he would have or the FAA retirement he'd have if he had left earlier. Some FAA controllers are making upwards of $200,000. Given  the rarity of the E-8 rank and the extreme rarity of  the E-9 rank, significantly below 1%,  in any of the service branches, fewer E-9's than  O-6 Colonels/Captains  in every branch but the USMC, and the sizable pay difference between E-7, E-8 and E-9, it would not make much sense for a controller to stay in till retirement given the opportunities in the FAA. <br>  There is also a lot of age discrimination in civilian companies where only young 20 somethings are hired to fill entry level positions. If a military retiree does not have transferable experience and even if he has earned a college degree or advanced degree, he will often times have a difficult time finding suitable employment, since he can only qualify for entry level positions.  An officer retiree because of his managerial experience can usually segue into mid level to high level positions even in areas where he does not have direct experience and where his age is not a hindrance but an asset. He will also have a much wider network of former military officers in similar positions who will form a circle of contacts that can help him in his transition to civilian employment.  <br>  If a guy has  the ability and desire it only makes sense  to go to college and earn a degree. The military will pay for him to do this even before serving a single day. <br>  Good Luck!|`|7f1TfskEaa	Yes.  The retirement pay is kind of fuzzy because there will be pay raises, but also inflation by the time you retire.<br>  <br>  It isn't just the money.  A HUGE benefit is that when you retire, your health care is covered for life.  You also have access to PX and Commissary (not a huge benefit, depends on where you live); military recreation facilities (compare golf course fees in Hawaii for private and military courses).  You also retire very young which allows you to start a second career.|`|lrVSk62yaa	Oh ya you get a good retirement check and then you can go work at another job and then get that more money from that job.  then when you retire from that job you get two retirement checks.  that is what my grandpa did when he was in the Marines.  so i would do it.<br>  Semper Fi|`|PBq7ODPzaa	What it doesn't take into account is your age upon retirement.  If you join the army at 18 you would retire at 38, then you start your second career, work till you're 60-65 and then retire again.  2 retirements, 2 checks.  Now, let's say that second career is with the federal government, if that's the case those 20 years in uniform would also count towards your second retirement.<br>  <br>  Then there's the medical benefits.  <br>  <br>  So, yes, it does pay in the long run.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Did you do the math calculating the amount you contribute?  It's zero! That's a great return! You get basically 50% of your base pay (there is a little bit of math on that number, but close enough) with no contribution on your part, and if enlisted you may be only 38 years old!<br>  <br>  You can go work part time and enjoy yourself. Of course, if you're married with kids you'll be looking for work, but it's still a great deal!
E9XL5x3Paa	I think I've almost established what you are talking about, but I cannot for the life of me figure out who kelony is.<br>  <br>  <br>  As best as I can tell, you are asking why Brad Pitt did not go to Bush to ask for help for the victims of Katrina, now that he has gone to Nancy Pelosi to do just that.<br>  <br>  If that is what you are asking, then you've got me.  Maybe he didn't feel Bush would help.  I don't know if you remember, but Bush was more keen on trying to clear his name of even more incompetence charges than actually helping the victims of Katrina.  <br>  <br>  Maybe Brad Pitt just didn't like him; that was certainly a prevalent feeling among many at the time.<br>  <br>  Who really knows?  I'm sure Brad Pitt has a blog or myspace or facebook page; why don't you go ask him there?|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Clooney?? <br>  <br>  Clooney met with both Bush and Obama....and has also met with Congress and world leaders to talk about action in Darfur. He has done so for several years. <br>  Pitt has been working and living in New Orleans since 8 months after Katrina...He is personally building and repairing homes, along with many other volunteers from a variety of orgs. He went to Pelosi, likely, because Obama has shown an interest in volunteerism, community service, and in the gulf coast areas devastated by the storms. Pitt wasn't there to ask for help, specifically, though I am sure he wouldn't turn it down. He was there to remind Pelosi of the situation that is still going on in the Gulf, to promote his cause and the cause of the people in the region, and to ask Pelosi to make the area a priority in his administration.

U.S. soldiers had been 'advising and training' the ARVNs (Army of the Republic of Viet Nam).<br>  <br>  I believe that LBJ had some trigger-happy advisers and that he himself had a cowboy mentality, not believing that some little 5'3" tall little yellow guys could do any kind of serious damage to the 6' tall American soldiers. Too bad LBJ didn't look at how the French had had their butts kicked 10 years earlier by those 'little yellow people.'<br>  <br>  I might suggest that you read some books about Viet Nam, especially "A Bright Shining Lie," "The Ugly American," "Street Without Joy," There are also some good movies about Viet Nam, one of the best, IMHO, was "L'Indochine." So was "The Iron Triangle."

Ot7PJrddaa	The Army will still take you - my suggestion is that you get some counseling first.  The Army can be a difficult adjustment the older you are - it's tough to keep up with the young kids that join.  it's even harder for some to take orders from sergeants who are far younger than them.  Also be aware that if you join you will more than likely be deployed - if you aren't prepared for that don't do it.  I seriously hope things turn around for you - I am over 40 and about to retire from the Army.|`|4uike3ARaa	LOL  Sorry. That just came out.<br>  There are worse reasons to enlist, I suppose.

xjcZkmpbaa	Andy is correct.  Think of all the justifications that you want, but the Constitution says that representatives are selected by the voters of the various States.  D.C. is not a State.

AA12103453	What is pre-crime? Committing a crime to stop a crime is STILL committing a crime.

4VzVfKvdaa	I think you may have your tests mixed up.  The DLAB is language generic.  It doesn't matter what language you think you know.  It is designed to see what your potential for learning languages is.  Sounds like you are referring to the DLPT (Defense Language Proficiency Test) They are language specific and test your level of proficiency in a particular language.  A 3/3 listening and reading is considered native speaker.  Speaking is not required on the DLPT (unless that has changed recently).  If you do not read and write and hear Japanese on a native level, there is no point in you taking the Japanese DLPT.  By the way, what is proper Spanish?  The Spanish DLPT is one of the hardest because it tests for Spanish from Spain, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and all of Central America because as you have pointed out, Spanish is not necessarily Spanish everywhere.  Believe it or not, it has one of the highest washout rates in training.  If you don't know grammar, you are screwed on any of those tests.|`|AA10829482	ArchAngel is correct~ the DLAB determines your ability to learn a language. . .any language.|`|HvbIE03saa	The only thing I can think, regarding the Spanish: just because you speak the language or are from a Spanish speaking country doesn't mean you know it. Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  My example: at my highschool, we were required to take at least one year of foreign language, and the only one offered was Spanish. So, even all the Hispanic kids had to take it and a lot of them thought it would be no big deal, but a lot of them actually failed it. Not because they were bad students, but because they didn't know Spanish "by the book". <br>  <br>  Same goes for speaking English...How many people in this country speak english but would probably flunk an English test, or barely speak/spell it that well as it is?<br>  <br>  When the gov't gives tests as it relates to Languages it is as the language applies, by the book. So it's more in depth and complicated than just speaking it in everyday life. <br>  <br>  I work for the State, and they give a test that basically says if you're fluent in a language, we'll pay you more money. But the pass rate of the test is like 10%. I know like, 5 Hispanic people who've taken it and failed, and the one guy I know who passed it was a white guy who went to school and got is Bachelor's Degree in it. He'd learned it by the book, and so he passed the test.<br>  <br>  I figure if you've learned Japanese in school by the book, you'll probably do well on the test.<br>  <br>  Edit - Lol, I was going to say Castilian instead of Spanish, but I didn't want to sound like an *** or anything. My Spanish teacher (I took three years...speak it better than I read it, and much better than I write it, lol) was from Spain so we learned all about it, and she did a yearly trip to Spain for her advanced Spanish classes...pretty cool : )

Anyhow, this is a brilliant post, and I applaud you for standing up to what you believe is right.<br>  <br>  Take this problem to the board of education. Your teacher CANNOT force one sided ideas on her pupils. She has to teach both sides and listen to both sides. She cannot, absolutely cannot force these ideas!!! <br>  <br>  What Obama is doing is absolutely scary. This nation is turning on each other fast. I will be surprised if a civil war DOESN'T break out. I too think that he is encouraging the terrorists. The man doesn't have a clue what he was doing. He is not intelligent at all. You can certainly tell now that he is inexperienced. Thanks to all the Obama voters, this country is going to be in shambles.

Having the education system controlled by a union is a root cause of a lot of really stupid things that have happened. A union is a monopoly. Monopolies are always bad for consumers, but especially that one.<br>  <br>       Your questions:<br>       I'm worried that Obama will dither and appease, Iran will certainly acheive nuclear capability, and others in the region,too. After Bush demonstrated that we were willing to fight, our new leader will convince the delusional psychotics (kin to democrats) of the middle east that we prefer appeasement. Actually, a democrat president would have a unified nation in case of war - no opposition party treason. But this likely misperception may lead to war, as will the idea that WW2 pulled us out of the great depression. <br>  <br>       Meanwhile, the dems monomaniacal pursuit of bin laden might lead to war with Pakistan - a nuclear armed nominal ally which struggles to keep the radicals from taking over. "The stupidest things are done by smart people" - they fall in love with their ideas. Democrats have endless impractical ideas, no common sense.<br>  <br>       As for his tax and spend ideas. He can't be stupid enough to beleive that, so he's lying. He's seeking to grow the government, and buy votes from scared voters with the public treasury. Impoverished  voters will tend to vote democrat, they give better promises of benefits "if only the republicans didn't stop us".Creating economic distress is a marxist tactic, and is advocated by Obama's ALLY Alinsky in his book. Google "cloward-piven strategy" to see how this works.<br>  <br>       Civil war would be an unmitigated disaster, I sincerely hope that no conservative is foolish enough to start that.

He signed the biggest pork spending budget in US history, wasted trillions of dollars taking out a two-bit dictator that posed no credible threat, ignored other specific threats, like the NIE that said "Bin Ladin determined to attack targets inside the US."  Appointed known schuyster Henry Paulson to the post of Treasury Secretary.  Not only was he the worst interpreter of the Constitution, but he sought to reduce it to toilet paper, as seen in recently released justice dept. decisions citing his ability to suspend the 1st amendment to "wage war more effectively."<br>  <br>  Of course, you realize by now, I'm talking about W.<br>  <br>  And what about negotiating with "terrorists?"

If/when a revolution occurs, the fallout will likely lead to civil war, ultimately fought on racial lines as opposed to geographical or political ones. As that unfolds, we become extremely vulnerable to attack from foreign armies.<br>  <br>  Even the democrats know what they are doing will not work. While I don't agree with most of their philosophies, I do not think they are stupid. That being the case, the only logical conclusion is that there is an ulterior motive to continue down a path which history has shown, and they know, will lead only to failure.<br>  <br>  I keep trying to come up with a different answer, but the only one that makes any sense at all is complete socialism. Perhaps the goal is communism, but you can't get there from here, so socialism is the logical and next-best answer.<br>  <br>  Socialism is a transitory state. Once there, you either continue the path to communism, or turn back to capitalism. But socialism as an economic and political philosophy cannot, and does not exist for historically significant time periods. It is merely an avenue for change. Note all the socialist superpowers scattered around the globe.<br>  <br>  They aren't stupid, and they know it will fail, so you have to ask "why," and "why now."

If you acknowledge that their situation resulted because of things you supported and benefited from then you have to accept responsibility for the acts that caused this.<br>  It's no different than claiming we saved the Iraqi people from a heinous dictator but ignore that we devastated their country, their economy, opened the door for unprecedented acts of ethnic cleansing and displaced well over 1,000,000 people.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	That's a good question.<br>  <br>  I do know of a few people who are on welfare and do not work, they are all from one family.  The majority of people on "welfare" do work but they cannot provide enough for their families.  <br>  <br>  What I think is hilarious is the amount of people who rant about "lazy welfare recipients" and receive EITC, child tax credits, business credits, farm credits, etc.  Anyone who gets money back on their tax refunds above and beyond what they pay in federal taxes every year is receiving welfare.|`|1SB67BXyaa	Because Welfare is a horrible, horrible idea.  Ever hear the quote "Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day; Teach a man to fish, and he'll eat for a lifetime"?  All that welfare does is continually hand people "fish" so that they can get through the day.  They DO lack the motivation to help themselves.  Survival begins and ends with self motivation.  <br>  To be blunt, Welfare is a big slap in the face to survivalism.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Well I for one have seem many people abuse it as well using it as a suitable way of life so they can be lazy..... I never said all people on welfare but there are definitly a percentage that do.  Case in point, this woman having all those kids she can't provide for.  To give one example.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	What Alan S said +1<br>  <br>  Also, spare me the myth of "multi generational welfare families"  According to the law, a person can only collect TANF for 60 months total in their lifetime.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Ah, maybe we get that impression from the people that show up at Obama rallies and want cars, houses, etc.|`|89fe044c4d20ad11caa431bd83c3e20eaa	I have seen the same kinds of people you have.  I have even used unemployment insurance myself a few times while I looked for a new job and needed help paying the bills.  There are a lot of good, hard working people out there who have hit hard times and need some help from time to time to get by.  <br>  <br>  That being said, I have also known a few people who were exactly the stereotype you are describing.  They didn't try to find work because they knew they could live off the system without a lot of effort.  Here are a couple of examples that I have known personally.  One of our neighbors when I was growing up would give the hospital a fake name when they asked who the father was or pick a name out of the obituaries instead of telling them her boyfriend's name because then she could get welfare money more easily.  She also did not work because she could collect enough money from the government for "child welfare" to live off of.  One of my recent neighbors was one of the "multi-generational welfare families" living on government aid and was healthy enough that they could have worked but chose not to.  When they left, the abandoned a car on the street in front of the house that they had recently bought, gotten in an accident in, and was no longer drivable.  After they moved, there were several people who showed up looking for them from places they owed money to and had simply stopped paying when they moved.  <br>  <br>  That being said, the answer to your question is that it is a lot easier to remember the bad examples of anything than the good ones and then stereotype everyone the same way.  For example, is it easier to remember the rich person who is generous and looks for opportunities to help those around them, or the one who acts like because they have more money they should get special treatment?  I've seen both, and I've seen a lot more people who thing the rich are greedy than who think the rich are benevolent.  Just lie in the case you're talking about, it's a lot easier to pick up a negative prejudice or stereotype than a positive one.  <br>  <br>  BTW, the two people I talked about earlier were not of the same ethnic background.  One was white and one was black.  I also have very good friends from both ethnicities, which proves to me that you can't judge ANY group by a few individuals.  sadly, not everyone has realized this yet.<br>  <br>  Also, Shutterbug_Mama is wrong.  The tax breaks like child credit and business and farm credit are not welfare, they are merely discounts.  The difference is if you pay more in taxes to the government, or if you get more from it than you pay.  There are people who are truly handicapped and have a hard time supporting themselves.  There are also people who need a little help occasionally but work hard to support themselves.  Sadly, there are also people who genuinely choose to milk the system rather than putting forth the effort to support themselves.  Those are the people who caused the stereotype.|`|bJnqYE6maa	It comes from large numbers of welfare recipients who are lazy and irresponsible.  And then, the story gets exaggerated by angry taxpayers who are fed up with government handouts and so look suspiciously at everyone.    And it's easy because most of us saw that people who are looking for short term help couldn't get it.  The welfare system was looking for LONG TERM beneficiaries who were willing to live the welfare life style.<br>  <br>  The REAL story here is once again, how the misguided GOVERNMENT programs create situations that pit people against each other and cause class envy.  Welfare did more to increase racism in this country than anything else.<br>  <br>  Of course, anyone who works for the government or is supported by the taxpayer, is on welfare.  Social security, medicaid, medicare, artist grants, foriegn aid, porkbarrel spending... it's all welfare.   The government is paying welfare to 70 percent of the population.  Retirement benefits and salaries for government workers are OUTRAGEOUS.  There are two types of people in America:  Government workers and peasants.<br>  <br>  This country is doomed.  Plan your life around the idea of emigrating to another part of the world.|`|vHxauOyeaa	As far as personal experience goes, I would have to say I have been on unemployment before, and it wasn't until that ran out that I was trying harder than ever to find a job. I ran everything into the ground before getting lucky. <br>  <br>  Moral of the story is: If you feed a stray, it will come back time after time expecting food.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Could be it's all those multi-generational welfare families living in subsidized housing.<br>  <br>  Or maybe it's those young, healthy males that have time to shoot hoops all day but they can't work cuz they're on "disability".<br>  <br>  Or, it could be the women that have numerous children, all from different men, that should have thought about what they were doing when they were doing it instead of just having kid after kid so working people like me could support them.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Actually, I have seen and known people who started on Welfare who succeeded.  It is the ones that are like I can't work or I wont work that is part of the problem.  I also knew of a guy who calculated out how much he could earn each year to stay on government subsistence.  It is the single moms who keep on having children by different men, the drug abusers who refuse to work, and I can go on that make the system broken and needing fixed.  Also, there is a huge difference between looking for a job and being qualified to do the job.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Some people have a black and white mentality. Either you are all good, or all evil. Either the government should stay out of everything, or we're 'socialist'. There is no gray area for those people. If they see ONE person who they FEEL is on welfare who they FEEL is defrauding the system, that person automatically represents the majority or all of the people on welfare. Most educated people know this isn't true.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	Yeah.  Door after door slammed in their faces.<br>  <br>  Good one.<br>  <br>  I have known people who didn't look for a job because, and I quote, "but then I would lose my assistance!"<br>  <br>  Many people are on welfare because they are lazy, they either don't want to work, or they don't want to get an education.<br>  <br>  I would estimate the percentage of people on welfare who are lazy at 60% or better.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	It comes from the ones who are welfare, and there's a lot of them, have 6 kids all to different fathers and have no intentions of working. Their children turn into young adults, get pregnant and on it goes, into 3 and 4 generations. I have seen this with my own eyes and not going by what I read on the internet.

I wouldn't advise confronting the alleged stalker; YOU, or your  boyfriend, might wind up in jail.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	Section 264 of the Criminal Code states<br>  "(1)No person shall, without lawful authority and knowing that another person is harassed or recklessly as to whether the other person is harassed, engage in conduct referred to in subsection (2)that causes that other person reasonably, in all the circumstances, to fear for their safety or the safety of anyone known to them.<br>   <br>  Prohibited conduct<br>   (2)The conduct mentioned in subsection (1) consists of<br>  (a) repeatedly following from place to place the other person or anyone known to them;<br>  (b) repeatedly communicating with, either directly or indirectly, the other person or anyone known to them;<br>  (c) besetting or watching the dwelling-house, or place where the other person, or anyone known to them, resides, works, carries on business or happens to be; or<br>  (d) engaging in threatening conduct directed at the other person or any member of their family.<br>  <br>  You need solid proof that this is occuring.  It can't just be "I saw her at the mall and the grocery store, I think she is following me" or that you see her on a busy street near your house. <br>  I suggest starting a journal.  Write down all the incidents you can remember with as much detail as possible, ie dates times conversations, people present, etc. Then continue on.  When you see her on your street or following you, document it. Log phone calls and voicemail. Save voicemails, emails, anything else. The more occurances, the strong the case. <br>  Make sure the person doing the knows behavior this is unwelcome.  If you claim she is phoning and it is unwanted, there best not be any calls coming from your boyfriend to her.  <br>  There is a law for trespassing as well. <br>  Section 177. Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him, loiters or prowls at night on the property of another person near a dwelling-house situated on that property is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. <br>  Night is defined in the Criminal Code as between 9pm and 6am. It is a summary offence, which means she can only be arrested if Police find her committing the act.  She can still be charged if, but won't be arrested if she is gone when Police arrive., she will just be summons to court. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest a Peacebond.  Basically you apply for the Peacebond and the other party can agree to enter it.  If they don't, a hearing will be held.  The adjudicator decides whether the person should be bound by the Peacebond.  If they agree, it will be in effect for a period of one year.  It can have conditions depending on the situation, but it is most likely to be keep the peace and be of good behavior, do not contact your boyfriend directly or indirectly.  It can also prohibit the person from going to his address or work or any other place they feel is necessary.  A peacebond is not a criminal charge but breaching the conditions would be. It is very important that you fear the person and explain why.  A peacebond can only be issued if there is reason to fear the person, but not enough for a criminal code charges. You can go down the courthouse to find out how to request one. <br>  <br>  Depending on the province you live in, there may be a domestic violence policy that can help.

And since so many take whatever their church says as the word of God, they blindly accept it when the churches tell them that the ACLU is evil and hates God.<br>  <br>  The ACLU protects the Constitution, no more and no less.

Saying that women should have to sign up for the draft in order to actually be equal contradicts such a statement (ie: implying that women are the only ones that should stay at home and raise the kids).|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	AWESOME!

War is real and people are dying over in Iraq and Afghanistan that are only 2 or 3 years older then you.  <br>  <br>  -Should i go to college first, or after joining the marines - College is expensive and the military offers great incentives to pay for schooling, however the more they pay the longer you stay is the general rule of thumb.  <br>  <br>   -Will their benfits pay for my college tuition?  A lot of special programs are out there but again, you are pretty much locked in for 6-10 years depending on how much schooling you want the government to pay for.<br>  <br>  -Is it possible to enter the USMC at a high rank if you go to a good 4 year college?  High rank no, but you won't start at the bottom either.  If you join at an earlier age, you start off lower rank, but you also can retire in 20 years so that's the way you recoop compensation for lower rank and pay.  <br>  <br>  -What other benefits are there from joining the Marines? Teaches Discipline, you travel and see a lot of places.<br>  <br>  -Do you see a lot of combat? We are in a time of war, so I would say it very credible you will see combat.<br>  <br>  -Can you ask to be put in a certain area other than iraq? If you are asking this question, you better think long and hard about joining any military branch.  Once you are in, it's not an option to question and request until you receive merit and rank.<br>  <br>  -How can you work in the embassy?

Are they really that bored, and have nothing to do? - War can really play a toll on someones physical and mental awareness.  I am sure there is downtime, but it only takes a second of goofing around before you trip an IED and game over.  <br>  <br>  - You can serve your country in many ways, why do you feel it's necessary you owe giving your life for a war that isn't even approved in the Unites States populations eye?  Go to school and get involved with contracting supporting government agencies if you want to help out the war fighter.  Just some ideas but think long and hard, because I have seen info that would turn casper the ghost WHITE!

If you think you should go to school first, than do it. You can go in and try out for Officer Candidate School and you can get a high rank.<br>  <br>  If you go in as enlisted, if you get 2 or 3 other recruits than you get promoted to PFC after boot. If you graduate boot camp as squad leader/honor man you get an extra rank.<br>  <br>  There is no medic in the marines. It's the navy's job.<br>  <br>  VA Benifits are rare, sometimes they kick in right away, sometimes they never do. It's a game of chance with them.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go to Iraq/Afghanistan, do not join the marines. Im not saying you will go there, but the marine corps is not for you if you don't want to go. Join Air Force.<br>  <br>  Embassy duty is assigned after 4 years or very close to that. You have to renlist for that job I believe.<br>  <br>  If you think every youtube video of marines being bored when they are not working is what the marine corps is all about, please do us all a favor and just stay in school.|`|AA12343591	Bob, you are a piece of lib trash|`|m3eFscuqaa	Yeah, get paid to murder people. Do it.|`|S6IumG2naa	-Should i go to college first, or after joining the marines.<br>  It depends on if you want a job as an enlisted Marine or an officer. Officers make a lot more money and can do some other types of jobs like being a pilot, although you do need a 4 year degree beforehand.<br>  -Will their benefits pay for my college tuition?<br>  If you choose to go to college while your in/after you get out there are benefits that pay for it. If you go to college before joining they will not pay for that.<br>  -Is there any position in the Marine corp where i can work as a Medic.<br>  No, the Navy corpsman take care of us.<br>  -Is it possible to enter the USMC at a high rank if you go to a good 4 year college?<br>  You will be an officer if you have a four year degree and go to Officer Candidate School versus the enlisted boot camp. <br>  -What other benefits are there from joining the Marines?<br>  You get to see a lot of the country/other countries, meet lots of people, stay in good shape<br>  -Do you see a lot of combat?<br>  It depends on your job, you will get deployed at some point but obviously somebody in the infantry will see more combat than an admin clerk.<br>  -Can you ask to be put in a certain area other than iraq?<br>  You do not have a choice where you get stationed, but you will not get stationed in Iraq actually, you will just go there for a deployment.<br>  -How can you work in the embassy<br>  MSG, Marine security guard is a job you apply for after you have done a deployment and are at least an E-3.You have to be single as well as you will be going to other countries and will not be able to go home during that time. <br>  -How do you get promoted<br>  I don't know exactly how it works for officers, but for enlisted the first 2 promotions is based on time being in, after that it is based on your performance, physical fitness, rifle score, conduct<br>  <br>  Additional Questions<br>  -I've seen youtube videos of Marines just messing around. Are they really that bored, and have nothing to do?<br>  Yes, sometimes there will be times where you are just waiting for a long period of time and get very bored and do dumb stuff to entertain themselves, they are just stupid for posting these videos on the internet for the public to see.|`|baa554c1084fb5fc5ba320e76fb718fdaa	Given that there are 3 answers here, none of whom are probably in the Marines (and neither am I, but keep this in mind) I actually have some useful information.<br>  <br>  I'm not a Marine, and I'm not an American (or a Soldier of any kind for that matter; I'm actually a Canadian), so take this with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  Going before or after is up to you, there might be a program (like in Canada, the Regular Officer Training Plan [ROTP] that will pay for your University in exchange for time served in the Corps when you get out.)<br>  <br>  Benefit pay: As I understand it there is a benefit allowance on entering depending on the specialty you go into, and how trained you are for it. This'll vary though.<br>  <br>  High Rank: Don't expect a super-high rank. I can't base that on anything except the fact that it's the Marines, and it takes time to develop leadership abilities.<br>  <br>  Benefits from joining: You're in the Marines! They're rough, and tough. Beyond that, you'll have to talk to one.<br>  <br>  Combat: Marines do 6-month tours, as opposed to the 12-month or 18-month tours standard for the other Branches. (Correct me if I'm wrong anyone.) They're more fast-in-fast-out, which influences the type of action they see. Whether that means more combat, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Put in a certain area: You're sent where you're needed. If you voice your concern to your Chain of Command they may take it into account but chances are you're going as a unit, and chances are your unit is needed in Iraq.<br>  <br>  Working in an embassy (I just saw this on The Simpsons "Sir! We don't tolerate that kind of crap! Sir!") would require you to get to a certain rank (I don't know what it is, sorry) and then apply for a posting. Read up on Recruiter postings, it's quite similar, as far as I can tell.<br>  <br>  Promotions: Read here for all the good stuff: <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/marinepromotions/a/marineprom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/marinepro...</a><br>  <br>  And on the Marines messing around, you'll see that in every branch (and you see it in the Canadian Forces videos too.) Military men have to let off steam too; don't consider it "messing around." That couple of minutes may be the only fun they have all day.|`|C26hGbb6aa	Medical is with navy corpsman i believe|`|4W8ulnxqaa	Hello, <br>  I'm 21 years old and a college student, with a keen interest in the USMC. With regards to college I suggest you go through college first, there is a program you should be able to find rather easily in most colleges its called ROTC or NROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps. and Naval {Navy} Reserve Officer Training Corps respectively). what these do is simple. they allow you to attend college, and sometimes give you a scholarship to pay for it, and train to be a commissioned officer in the branch you wish to serve in.[Marines would be Second Lieutenants, Navy Ensigns]<br>     <br>  With regards to serving as a medic you would have to go Navy for that since the Marines don't offer that path (Navy takes care of patching them up) navy personnel are deployed with marines and serve in that function. <br>  <br>  The list of benefits for being an active member can be found by going to Marines [dot] com for starters, but they include free housing, medical and 30 days paid vacation a  year.<br>  <br>  Marines have this saying that goes "Every Marine a rifleman" and they seem to live it, there are many stories of the "Presidents own" (presidential band, who are all Marines) trading their instruments for M16s and going off to fight. so you can expect to be required to fight.<br>  <br>  With regards to posting well I'll try to answer later since I'm going through the process of enlisting myself, but so far what I've learned is that it depends on your MOS, but then again I don't really know that last bit. <br>  <br>  As a personal piece of advice, I love my country and I'm enlisting knowing it will be a very hard experience but I do so gladly because I believe in it and have put a lot of thought into it. don't rush in, think about it long and hard. <br>  If you want to talk to someone to help make up your mind I suggest you don't talk only to recruiters as it is their job to get you to enlist, I'll be around for a couple of weeks if you would like to talk more about it. Email me with your question as a topic and Ill be sure to answer.
Ot7PJrddaa	You need to get all your medical paperwork in order and set up a medical evaluation board - AGR has to first go through their state - if they determine you are non-deployable you will be sent to Ft Knox for a regular army evaluation board where they will make a decision as to if you are deployable or not.  If they determine you aren't able to deploy or do your job you will be given disability rating and a determination made on payment.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	uh, have you asked the docs?????|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Have you talked to your doctors about it. If your condition is such that you are on limited duty (profile) and have medical restrictions on your job then you have a better chance.<br>  <br>  You need to stick with keeping medical personnel informed of you health status. Make them order tests. Seek treatment. Be active and make sure everything is well documented.|`|rVPrhd26aa	13 years, wow you could have left if you didn't reenlist. this would be your 3rd tour of duty right.<br>  <br>  there probably not going to let you go unless you are seriously injured.<br>  you could probably get out by saying something like "gee doc can you do something to ease my butt, i tore it up real bad while engaging in homosexual activity."<br>  I'm pretty sure though if they find out your not really gay you could get in huge trouble and possibly labeled as a deserter.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Take this up with your 1st Sgt or Company commander. There will be LOTS of paperwork required, med evals and such. YOU  have the burden to prove you have an injury that qualifies for a med discharge.|`|jinAwMGNaa	Go to the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) and ask for help.  They helped me with my disabilities|`|JDAbWnJraa	It would seem to me that if you can not perform your job (MOS), that you would have to be providing a reason as to why you can not perform your function. This could be in the form of a medical profile classification, such as a temporary,T3, P3 or other. If you have one of these, the commander is well within his right to have you re-assigned to a position or job function that you can perform within the limits of your profile and continue to serve out your enlistment. A medical discharge would really only be used in an instance where there is simply no job that you can effectively perform and it serves the best interests of the military more to just send you packing. So if you are still in, they must have a use for you and you can serve out the remainder of your current enlistment. Note, you will be barred from any further re-enlistment if you possess a P3 profile, so just make sure that you list any aches and pains during your exit physical and paperwork so that you can maybe qualify for benefits through the VA once you're out.|`|AA10551203	Talk to your doctors. Tell them that you cant do the job anymore. They should set you up for physical evaluation board. They will look at all of your medical problems and make a decision of if you should stay on active duty or not.  Also talk to your First Sgt. He should be able to steer you in the right direction.|`|vcBINj8caa	Did you ask your Superiors or you'd have to get an injury that disables you from doing anything
2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	Did you make copies of everything you sent?  If PC has not received the packet, you need to figure it out as soon as possible.  Any delay in the medical portion of the clearance can really delay the invitation to serve.  If you made copies, you may be able to send those in as backup.  If not, then definitely call your medical staffer in Washington DC and explain the situation.  Worst case scenario is you will have to get your doctor to fill out another set of forms.  But, you definitely want to inform PC about the fact that you sent the forms in and have not received any confirmation as to whether they have been received.  The medical clearance is the hardest part of the entire process.  Good luck!

K8qAniReaa	Generals start West Point, Army ROTC, and Officer Candidate School.  When a person graduates from any of those sources they are commissioned as a 2nd LT in the United States Army.  A 2nd LT is always higher rank than any enlisted soldier no matter how long they have been in.  A 2nd LT is an officer that can be promoted up the officer ranks to general.<br>  <br>  There is a total separation from enlisted and officer. The highest rank an enlisted person can get is Sergeant Major of the Army (which is really high but they still have to salute every officer they see). If an enlisted person wants to become an officer they have to go to one of those three sources to get their commission.  It is not requred that a person enlist before becoming an officer.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Yes, but they need to earn a college degree first.<br>  <br>  Most generals start as 2nd Lt's after college.<br>  <br>  But there have been generals that have started out as privates<br>  <br>  Earned a college degree, been commissioned and then rose to general.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	yes, I did it, nco to officer|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Most generals go the WEST POINT<br>  and start as Officers~2nd Lieutenant<br>  but you can go from NCO to officer if you pass OTC|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	I'm confused aren't NCO's already officers.

KKH9y0ECaa	There are many thousands of mobile phones stolen and lost each day and the police simply don't have the resources or manpower to track them all.<br>  <br>  If your phone is registered you can immobilise it, meaning it is useless to any thief, you can do this by contacting your phone provider or the phone industries own security networks (see link below).<br>  <br>  There is a step by step guide to protecting your mobile and what to do if your mobile is stolen here -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Protect-a-Mobile-Phone-from-Being-Stolen" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Protect-a-Mobile-...</a>|`|IdtzdpqGaa	Just return the phone you took, no questions asked.  Isn't always the case oh this is about my friend|`|CHSIzFq9aa	You should go fill out the police report and try and have someone get a statement recorded like oe of your other friends with this kid saying that he stole your phon. I had a similar issue with a phone in jersey and the police wouldn't do anything or the phone company (AT&T) for that matter.|`|AA10813928	The police will not track your phone, that's true, but the carrier knows exactly who is using it.  When you call to activate a phone, you have to give the unique code (usually inside the battery compartment) that corresponds to that phone.  If your "friend" is using another carrier, he still has to activate it on that carrier, using the code.  If you have the box, you have the registration info.<br>  My wife lost her brand new Blackberry at the theater a couple years ago, and she knew exactly who had activated the phone using another SIM card just a week later.  Granted, she works for a cell phone provider, but all she needed to do was input the "code" in the computer, and it popped up with name, address, & new phone number.|`|4f3cjyw7aa	Police will use the GPS inside the phone to track it down.  I didn't think a big city would bother with this, but I have personally seen a major metropolitan police department do this.  They tracked down the phone to an address, got a search warrant, searched the house, and located the stolen phone.<br>  <br>  If you call the police before you de-activate your phone service, they can just track which cellular towers the phone is "active" within and use that to narrow down a distance.  I've seen them so precise as to get a street address.|`|AA11525565	Truthfully they don't have the time for petty theft.  They won't look for it unless you are sure the other person has it and then they'll only ask if he has it.  If they answer no.  They won't go on some huge investigation to track it.

n2oEhdZiaa	The Coast Guard has the luxury of being very selective.  I wouldn't bet on it but your recruiter is the only one who can help you and would have to submit the request.  Since the color vision is probably a policy requirement for the duty position rather than a true medical deficiency it is likely what you would need would be an Exception to Policy, which is even more unlikely.
PtRmhxU9aa	That's TV. In many jurisdictions, CSI's don't even carry weapons. However, most people who do carry a weapon as part of our job find that those things get pretty heavy and uncomfortable after 8+ hours, so it's usually the first thing to go when we get home.|`|fAcVndo7aa	Actually, it depends on where the CSI works.  In some places, "CSI's" are civilians - so they don't carry weapons at all.  In others, the "CSI" job is done only by police detectives - so they can carry weapons at any time.  Most of what you see the actors doing on shows like "CSI" is a medley of several jobs in the criminal justice field.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	Most CSI people are not even police officers.

fAcVndo7aa	It depends on your jurisdiction.  Some "crime scene investigator" jobs are filled by law enforcement personnel, because there isn't a large call for specific crime scene analysis.  In those jurisdictions, most of the analysis is done by an outside or regional lab.  But in other places, civilians are hired for the on-scene jobs and specially trained civilians (with degrees in one or more forensic areas, like criminology or toxicology) are hired to do the actual lab analysis.

I'm assuming, based on what you've told me, he'll just get probation. Of course, probation means getting tested regularly and if he fails any tests, he goes to jail for the rest of his sentence. You need to make him aware of how important that is.

The money they send back home is often a major source of income for the families left behind.  The downside is that it is usually young fit healthy males, usually of above average intelligence that go so the long term economy and society is impoverished.  The Us has benefited over the years from this pattern of immigration, taking the best and brightest, both legally and illegally from other countries.<br>  <br>  I am not aware of any studies showing a link between emigration rates and crime in the country of origin.  The biggest issue is the rise of people smugglers as any market niche will be exploited by someone.  Many Illegals are in hock to a crime band back home.<br>  <br>  Population Control - as they tend to lose a chunk of the young males this tends to depress birth rates.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself how come it's OK for American firms to move capital out of the US to exploit labour in Mexico and the likes, but not for labour to move to take jobs elsewhere?  The modern nation state is a recent invention and is designed to support capitalisim.  That's why so many big US companies are registered in the Caymen Islands and the likes to avoid paying tax, putting the tax burden on poor joe public.

The bill ignores the ESRB age rating for games, and instead makes its own definition of inappropriate violence.<br>  <br>  This definition considers inappropriate any game which “lacks serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic or political value” and which features glamorized or gratuitous violence; uses that violence to shock or stimulate; features violence that is not contextually relevant to the material; has violence so pervasive that it serves as the thread holding the plot of the material together; trivializes the serious nature of realistic violence; does not demonstrate the consequences or effects of realistic violence; uses brutal weapons designed to inflict the maximum amount of pain and damage; endorses or glorifies torture or excessive weaponry, or depicts lead characters who resort to violence freely.<br>  <br>  Under the law, no person, not even minors' parents or guardians, would be allowed to give or show them an inappropriately violent game. Retailers would also not be able to have such games on display where minors could see them, unless the lower two-thirds of the boxes were hidden behind "blinder racks," of the sort commonly used for sexually explicit magazines.|`|AA12357780	never heard of it, what's it about?

Jackson:<br>  <br>  The first place you'll go to is the 120th reception battalion. It's where all new soldiers go. It'll last anywhere from 3 to 7 days. For me, that was the worst week. I say that because the one thing that you'll be doing the most is waiting. You know have no concept of what waiting in a line means by Army standards. Your 'company' will probably have about 600 soldiers in it. You will wait in that line, no talking, all week. Wether it's for chow, hair cut, medical, dental, eye exam, financial, whatever. You have to understand that if it was just one person doing this, it'd only take an hour or two, tops. But they have to process between 1 to 2 thousand soldiers that week. It takes forever. Don't worry, they give you reading material. It's honestly not that hard, just do what they tell you, when they tell you, and don't say anything except yes and no drill sergeant. It really is too easy. Then, usually on a friday, your boot camp drill sergeants will come and pick all of you up. Their goal for your first impression of them is for you to be nothing less than terrified of them. Be expecting this. And no, just about nobody there is going to be nice to you, get over it. I know it sounds mean or whatever, but thats just how it is. After that first week of reception comes the nine weeks of BCT. These nine weeks are divided up into three phases. Pay attention, this is useful: The three phases, in order, are red phase, white phase, and blue phase. Red phase is the first three weeks of training, these are the toughest weeks. During these weeks are when the drills are going to smoke you the most. Make no mistake, you're going to get smoked the entire nine weeks, but red phase is when they really lay it into you. During red phase, you'll go to pugil stick training, bayonette assault course, Victory Tower, confidence courses, and the gas chamber, called the NBC chamber. (Nuclear, biological, chemical, I think). White phase is a lot better than red phase, you get more priviledges and the drills lay off a little bit more. These weeks, however. are considered the most stressful. This is because you'll be qualifying on your M16 A2 rifle. It's stressful because most of the privates won't be able to shoot very well at all right off the bat, it is very frustrating. Often times most of the stress is shown when the privates fight amongst themselves. But as long as everyone keeps their cool, it'll all be OK. Then blue phase is the best phase. The drills start to treat you a little better. Understand that you all will feel a little like cattle, the dirlls always herding you around and treating you like crap. But blue phase is a lot better, and a whole lot of fun. During this phase, you get to go to the grenade range, fire a whole lot of really big weapons, and you'll go to victory forge, a week in the field. It really is a whole lot of fun. Then the last week is clean up, outprocessing, family day, and graduation day.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember is, it is NOT as bad as it sounds. It'll take a little adjusting, but chances are that you'll have fun during the whole thing. In order to ensure this, you have to follow this philosophy: Your goal is to not have the Drill Sergeants notice you AT ALL. If it's been 5 weeks in, and the drills still don't know your name, then youre good. The less you stick out, the more enjoyable of a time you'll have. This works both ways; don't do anything to get in trouble (don't talk), and never, never volunteer for anything.<br>  <br>  So, have a great time becoming a Soldier in the United States Army. And remember during all the hard times that'll come, remember this; It's worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. go on goarmy.com and look up Basic Training, they have video recordings of it, it was really helpful for me.|`|P3mZfJB2aa	boot camp be prepared for extremly rigorous physical training|`|sDUMhTy9aa	wellll.....its the hardest, boringest,most exciting,exausting, life changing, proud thing you can do..... sorry for the spelling. take what comes and do your best. its all a head game and once you understand the mind f#%* you have no prob. if that helps.

Since we have a 'defence' department it seems the language allows for endless funding of our tax money to be on the defensive in this country.  I'd like to see money that actually goes into a dept. that is pro active in solving problems in a non-military way so we can have peace.

I am around liberals & we are very peaceful, happy & healthy. You are going to get in life what you are sending out. If you feel fear you will have everything come to you that resonates with fear. If you decide to feel anything you will see life mirror that feeling. Try being still & thinking about being frustrated. You will everything that can happen to frustrate you.

teKeLxX2aa	Yea, they don't give them away to people like you. You need to have a class III license to own an automatic weapon made after the ban in the 80's. The only people I know of that are allowed to buy and own G-18's are Class III dealers, SWAT, and a few other exceptions along the government service lines. As cool as it looks, an MP-5 would be more ideal in the close quarter situations that warrant a small, automatic firearm. <br>  <br>  However, if you are 21 you can buy a G-17 in most states (18 in Texas). The only difference is the automatic mode.|`|JDAbWnJraa	Shoot man, you can buy a .50 cal ma-deuce if ya wanna. Just get ready to pony up the green it's going to take to buy it. Plus, you need to purchase your federal tax stamp to possess an automatic firearm and get ready for the random BATF inspections on your home to verify that you do possess the weapon at any given time and that you provide adequate secure storage for it. My advice? Buy a Glock 17 and learn to be accurate while pulling the trigger really fast.  :)|`|qXvFsnOcaa	Which state, better yet which country?|`|PBq7ODPzaa	I doubt you can buy one without a federal stamp.

If a private entity restricts your freedom, it's not unconstitutional.  This is often referred to as the "state action doctrine."  For example:<br>  <br>  A business has a policy of restricting the internet for everyone on their network [constitutional]<br>  <br>  -versus-<br>  <br>  A state has a law of restricting the internet for everyone in the state [unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment]|`|zejFr1Ciaa	If your referring to Yahoo's yes.

n2oEhdZiaa	Yeah, when you contract with ROTC just make sure you don't contract for the Guard.  It should be an easy slam dunk.  Your ROTC contract will supersede your Guard enlisted contract.|`|wCuR9yxWaa	I was a Cadet at Cornell University, it is really difficult to go Active Army from National Guard as an officer. The National Guard is very low on officers in the ranks and doesn't like to let them go. If you want active right after college then do well in school (get a high GPA), do well on your PT, and excel in your ROTC program. If you don't do well in those aspects they can and will force you to go National Guard/Reserves.
OEhH9hcvaa	1) yes we should stop the illegal immigration but in the same time American people should lose their hate feeling how we stop them to come here illegally? we need to reform our immigration system in order to be able to cover the demand in time and avoid to make the immigrants wait for years to obtain the green card ..<br>  <br>  because the reasons why many of them decide to come in <br>  this country illegally are<br>  <br>  a) they don't have money for all immigration process like pay $300 for the green card <br>  <br>  c) this people need a job now so they can't wait 1 or 2 years<br>  to obtain the legal right to work in our country<br>  <br>  b) unfortunately SOME of them has a criminal record<br>  so they can forget to obtain the legal right to be here.<br>  <br>  2) I already answer to that see answer 1<br>  <br>  3) guest worker is working very well in Europe such Italian workers go to work in Switzerland and then go back in Italy in the end of the day.<br>  <br>  PS if you check it out the statistic of illegal immigrants deportation you should see is not working we spend million of dollars for nothing because we deport 1% of illegal immigrants a year and 80% of them they will cross our border again so we need to be more smart and the only solutions of this problem is give to the illegal immigrants present in our country 6 months or 1 year to change their immigrant status from illegal to legal this system it work very well in Europe But once again American people need to lose their hater feeling because illegal immigrants they will never come out from the shadow if they are afraid to come out and do the right thing...<br>  <br>  solution<br>  <br>  1) lose the hater attitude<br>  2) make a plan to reform our immigration system<br>  3) make a plan to legalize the illegal immigrants are ready here<br>  4) intensify the relationship between US Government and Government of Mexico in order to control better the illegal immigrations {in both countries}<br>  5) pass a law against immigrant discriminations <br>  6) educate American people better about the cause of our economical crisis in order to avoid to blame the wrong people in this case the illegal immigrants|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	1. Yes. Take away incentives, jobs, welfare, WIC, housing assist, education and especially birthright citizenship and they will leave and not come back.<br>  2. The ones currently here should have their jobs taken away, Welfare payments stopped, housing confiscated, and told they have 30 days to vacate the US or they will be incarcerated.<br>  3.We currently have such a program. It works when workers are held to the guidelines. Again birthright citizenship has to stop. These workers bring their whole family over here, have a US born child and then don't leave. Most courts won't deport because of the US born child. If the families stayed in their own country while the work was being done and the worker left when the work was finished there would be no problem. I don't see why it should be such a hardship for that family to be separated for 3-6 months. Of course, the worker always has the opportunity to return to his country for short visits.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	1. ABSOLUTELY!! The majority of tax paying U.S. citizens do want it stopped and no amnesty ever given.<br>  <br>  2. As they are caught they should be deported.

Yes, it should be stopped and the only way to do it is by enforcing the laws so that other people realize there is no gain in coming here illegally and by protecting the borders.<br>  2.

Get rid of all of them.|`|6b4d4fb2e519a8ffe2f58e1c9e3c4a2baa	1: Yes secure the border if necessary use the military to do it 2:Deport them all they don't deserve better treatment than legal immigrants 3:No, it would just be anoyher chance to abuse/misuse the system

The discipline, bearing, tact, able to function under stress, etc. Now do I recommend being a supply clerk? Nope.

oVhKGw3Maa	First of all let me give this warning to all out there, NEVER ACCEPT A POLICE CAUTION, in the UK that is. Because when you do it is recorded and counts as an admission of guilt. So now you have a police record. I bet the cops never told you that did they. People think that by taking a caution, the cops are slapping your hand and thats that, but it is not. All you have done is save yourself a day in court and the possibility of it being in the local paper, but you still have a record and I may be wrong, but I think it stays on a lot longer than if you had been sentenced. So if you think you have any chance of beating the charge, do not accept a caution. Now to answer your question, yes you will have to declare the caution for a long,long time.|`|ucYwexwJaa	can't say for certain, again, I'm not in the U.K. but in America when you get a warning you do not need to follow-up with anyone or anything else....that's why it's a warning.
080ef161ce9dc1dd3330f3f9c97b5087aa	Yes. Shoplifting requires the accused thief's intent to acquire the store's merchandise without properly tendering payment of legal tender to the cashier in advance for it and an overt act to take unlawful possession of it. Presumably, the individual charged with shoplifting----but too slow to evade capture so he or she is still on the premises--has caught the attention of store personnel or third-party witnesses because of some suspicious behavior, such as making an effort to conceal the item(s) underneath clothing or in a pocket, purse or other receptacle. The failure to escape the premises of one's victim is not a defense to a charge of shoplifting.|`|c6fa1c48b50a2ff6881a317afb32f395aa	No, you always have the excuse that you were going to pay for it before you left the building. Once you step out of the doors security can charge you with shoplifting.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	In the United States, you have to be caught with the merchandise outside the store in order to get charged with theft. Good luck!|`|aZXnW6AUaa	no and it depends on the conditions|`|qwaWd14vaa	All laws revolve around INTENT. <br>  If you have a shopping cart and are putting items into your pockets, not the cart, is your intent to steal, check out by the cash register, paying for items in the cart without paying for items in your pocket? (Intent to defraud)|`|WyiOhCsjaa	If you actually read the law on shoplifting, you will see that you must leave the store before you can be charged. Legally, you CAN put something inside your coat and then bring it up to the counter. But, if you reach an outside door, then you are legally shoplifting and can be charged. I don't know about your laws in scotland or wherever, but the criminal codes of both the USA and Canada both have the same law.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	What is English Law???   Anytime you take 'control" over property that is not yours, you have committed a crime.  Like putting it in your pocket, under your shirt etc.  If you did that , you can be charged with theft, unlawful control of property, burglary etc.|`|xjcZkmpbaa	I don't know anything about the law in Scotland, but here in the USA concealing an item while you're still in the store is presumed to show intent to steal the item.|`|XLSfTnISaa	YES.

fTbI4cnSaa	Read your lease. If it says you can't hang bikes from the porch, or that you can't do things that the management decides is esthetically displeasing, or that you have to obey management's policies even if they change them, then yes, they probably can. Tenant's rights vary from place to place, so it's possible you have recourse from your local government. You might also get all the cyclists together and complain to the management as a group, which might have more impact.|`|AA10123414	You can abide by the rules or move. it is their property.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Nope....you can move|`|4f3cjyw7aa	Re-read your lease and see if there is anything on there about "esthetically pleasing" environments.  If not, then tell them the lease (which is a contract) does not restrict the use of your porch in the manner they are specifying.<br>  <br>  If they breached the lease with you, you can always sue them for breach of contract.  I have a feeling, however, that the lease has a clause somewhere about an "esthetically pleasing" environment, most do.  If that's the case, there isn't much you can do except move when your lease is up.|`|4b9a85a6035089657723b2a7f272c834aa	Did you sign a piece of paper that agreed to terms and conditions set forth by any type of housing committee?

AA11523416	Yes but some people don't know how to end the cycle. Who's to say that these people are really trying to get out but can't because they don't know how to.

If it bothers you get out of that job. Not everyone is so well off. Maybe there are reason the adult daughter needs help. Maybe she has a little bit of a learning problem and couldn't go to college, so the best job she could get is minimum wage.  And with the cost of living just needs a little bit of help.

Who can this girl turn to for help?  Her mother obviously doesn't have the resources.  Then the mother with the children that are still under 18.  Without an education, what kind of job could this woman get that could pay for childcare and still cover her living expences.  It doesn't take much for a family to loose their benefits and be living worse off than they were before.  The system is broken in that it doesn't help you get out of poverty, it just maintains your poverty until you maintain your poverty yourself.|`|53039dc5b545e80e793402ee5fef4353aa	Sure!

Courts don't like to allow default judgments because they'd prefer the case was solved on the merits, and it's acceptable, but frowned upon for an attorney to file the entry on the 20th day.  But the court can't really say that you don't get to file.  14 days after that, there's a hearing...  if the defendant has filed something with the court, they must get notice of the hearing...  if they have not, they don't get notice.  Defendant can come to that hearing and the judge can extend the time for the lawsuit if the defendant had a good reason for not responding within the previous days (most anything is a good reason).  If the suit meets certain regulations, the clerk can enter the default judgment and rule 55 says that he would do so no more than 60 days after plaintiff made the entry for the default.  If plaintiff has requested default by a motion to the court, they will have that hearing on the 14th day and the judge can declare the default judgment then.<br>  <br>  20 days initially for answer, entry, then judgment 14 - 60 days after the entry.

lvuuRvdTaa	This stuff these people are saying is bs.The  immigration bill  would offer legal status to most of the nation’s 12 million illegal immigrants while also toughening border security.<br>  If the bill becomes law, it would result in the biggest changes in immigration law and policy in more than 20 years. That would provide President Bush with a political lift and a tangible accomplishment for his second term. It would also be a legislative achievement for the new Democratic leaders in Congress, though they said they would seek changes in the measure. At the heart of the bill is a significant political trade-off. Democrats got a legalization program, which they have sought for many years. Republicans got a new “merit-based system of immigration,” intended to make the United States more competitive in a global economy.But the politics of the deal are precarious. With the issue of when the bill is passed it goes next week to the Senate floor, where negotiators predicted that it would receive overwhelming support. One reason for that  was the partnership in evidence at the news conference where the package was announced by 10 senators, including Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a liberal Democrat, and Jon Kyl of Arizona, a conservative who is chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.Although unless the White House produces 60 or 70 Republican votes in the House, it will be difficult to pass an immigration bill similar to the Senate proposal.The bill includes a temporary-worker program, under which 400,000 to 600,000 foreign workers could be admitted to the country each year.The proposal would create a permanent underclass of imported workers to fill American jobs.Besides creating a path toward legalization for illegal immigrants, the bill would strengthen the border through the addition of more fencing and other security measures.So unless the rest of you have something similar to this you are wrong.|`|kldqPF1Maa	not yet|`|40cd484352be60145f6ac7b0fb81f9f0aa	THEY CAN'T STAY.
