I have been researching and finding that jobs in the market that I want to work in want you to have a specialization in communications..Like producer for radio or tv, communications for magazine editor, or image editor.  Do I need to go back to get an undergrade to get the specializions?  Do anyone know of any certification I can get without truly going back to get another BS?  Do anyone know of a company that will hire a recent MBA graduate into the communications field where I can learn as I work.  Unfortunately, I'm finding that most companies want someone with experience.  I'm so-called overqualified for entry-level and not experienced enough for upper level.  In my region I have applied for jobs as secretary, receptionist, accounts payable and administrative support positions just to get my feet in the door at advertising companies, radio / TV broadcastings, and newspaper distributions.

All they require to set up is a shopping cart, and I know there are tons, like OSCommerce, Monster, X-Cart, etc.       But my situation is that I don't sell products, so I don't need a big traditional cart, with 'add to cart' and lots of products.        Instead, I just need to (a) display a page on my site to the client and take CC payment right there and (b) allow them to deposit funds in advance for our services, where they can select the amt to deposit.        I know this could be done with a customized API or something, but it's expensive / complicated to do this.  I'd like to use a free shopping cart to do it, but I don't know which ones to use.  Does anyone know the easiest way to take payments, syncing the html up with Paypal or Checkout?        Is there a shopping cart that has this sort of manual CC payment setup option?  I've been researching forever and would LOVE any advice you can give.

20070226080555AAu2HAe	Business & Finance;Credit	How do I dispute hospital charges on a credit report that were sent to the wrong insurance company?	My wife was treated on an outpatient basis at a local hospital in 2005. The hospital did not have her current insurance or contact information, so the bill was sent to neither us nor our insurance company.  The hospital then submitted the bill to a collection agency with the outdated contact information. Thus, we were entirely unaware of the existence of these charges until we checked my wife's credit report this February. I believe that my wife either gave the hospital current information, which they failed to record, or that they did not ask her. Can we have the hospital recover this charge from the collection agency and re-submit it to our insurance company? Also, do we have valid grounds to dispute the charge with the credit reporting agency?

20070303165305AA2udRe	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should i rent or buy in austin, tx?	Is it worth it to buy a home (condo) as a graduate student?      I've just been accepted into a PhD. program in Austin. The average time for completion is 5.5 years. Instead of moving from place to place I'm thinking of purchasing a condo there in the $75-85k range.       I'm 21 and graduating with my B.S. this May. I have no student loans. I own my car. I've paid the most of my tuition + rent + insurance + CC+ my car without parental help. I pay for my CC in full always. I also have $4k in Roth.       My acceptance into the program includes tuition waived, free health and dental insurance,  one year of Roth IRA paid and a $2500 "signing bonus." Most importantly, it guarantees an annual $24,500. There is no state income tax in Texas. However, I cannot work under the school's contract.       Many grad students buy their own apartments. In the same building, rent for a 1BR/1BA is ~$500-700 and many of the grad students there I've spoken with have mortgages in the $700-800 range.

20070314234254AAlm4An	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What do I need to prepare to refinance into a fixed rate loan?	My current mortgage loan will be resetting to an adjustable this coming Sept. I need to know what steps I need to take to possibly refinance into a fixed rate loan. My credit is not shiny  and the score is around 600. I only have about $2000 in credit card debt and will pay it off this month. Reason why is credit score is so low is because I had high credit card debts that went to collections but I managed to paid those off in 1999-2001. Someone told me to dispute negative items with the credit beareu. I was told that those negative items are to stay in my credit for up to 7 yrs? The clock is ticking and I'm so stressed out now I don't know where to start. The lending industries are tightening up their lending standards because of the subprime woes, does that mean I won't be able to refinance and end up losing my house if i can't pay the higher payment? My current rate is at 6.35% for $289000, what's my payment gonna be after Sept? I don't think my payment will double right? Plz HELP!

I'm highly considering using the builder's lender to take advantage of the incentives such as, 10k towards closing and 2 yrs paid HOA fees.       I had them run the numbers quickly on a 80/20 30yr fixed and the rate on the approximation was 7% on 80 and 10% on 20. Closing costs were about $13,000 on a $350k mortgage.       What should I watch out for? This deal seems to be pretty good given the fact that they are paying most of closing costs and 2yrs of HOA fees  ( @ $185 per month).
