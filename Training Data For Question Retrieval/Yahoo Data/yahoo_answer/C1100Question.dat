20090205034209AAVGbcW	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What would you say my style is?	This polyvore set is pretty much my day-to-day wear :]    http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=63344...    Although I often wear tanks/camis/tees in brighter colours I couldn't be bothered putting them on the set :p      My hair is black and shoulder length and kinda choppy (sometimes with extensions in) and I have black eyes and pale-ish skin, my make-up is generally quite natural unless I'm going out then I wear black or brightly coloured eyeliner with neutral eye shadow - I tend to avoid anything on my lips apart from maybe clear lip gloss :]      What would you say my "style" was?   What would you think if you saw me?      I'm just interested to know lol.      Thanks!   Love&Hugs   xxxxxxxxxxxx
20090205033813AAvdc2h	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair style help, short or long? opinions please, pics included?	I've always had fairly long hair. Last year I went for a bob and completely hated it on me, my hair has grown a lot now but it's all sort of one length and boring. I've always liked short hair but never gone for it, not sure if it would suit my face.      This is me fairly recently, one with hair down, one with hair up:       http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y93/Lou...        http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y93/Lou...

The only reason i get perms is because i have really thick black hair and its almost impossible getting it straight without adding some kind of Intense heat to it. so i was wondering does anybody know a way to get my back hair to start growing and i really cant get it cut because its already really short its not even past the middle of my neck yet SO PLEASE HELP         *would my hair be able to grow if i dont cut it off now and wait a little until im able to cut it to look nice cause like i said its very short in the back and if i cut it off ill pretty much look bald in the back.

So I have school photos on the first day of school and its my last year at highschool so I want to look my best, since its going in the year book I'll be keeping forever.      I couldnt book in a haircut in time so what sort of hairstyle could I do for my hair? Its really long, about three inches past my shoulders and its quite wavy with lots of layers. I also have a side swept fringe but its a little bit too long. I need lots of help here, give me detail like how to part, which bits to straighten and style etc.      I've heard that if your eyebrows are shaped correctly, you can bring out a more feminine look. Mine are half shaped but looking quite scraggly - no time for a professional waxing. I don't want them too thin, but one is thicker than the other, and the actual hairs themselvs are quite long. I've seen on tv that professionals cut the hairs?or should I just try a light eyebrow pencil?      I have an oval face but unfortunately only tiny unoticable cheekbones. Any suggestions to make my cheekbones stand out?      Also my eyes are a normal size but I want to make them stand out more without using eyeliner.. They're green if that helps.      I don't want to look over the top with makeup, the most I usually wear is foundation and mascara.      Thanks in advance, and don't laugh at my question, I know its all stupid but yeah, I want to look lovely! =P      Ps, which is better, liquid or powder foundation? also good brands for extremely pale pink toned skin?

I don't really wanna take it out because I really like the piercing and wanna get more eventually. Should I keep cleaning it with the solution they gave me when I pierced it or should  Iuse alcohol? Any advice would REALLY help!

20090205071655AA4WAA6	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Solution for dry flaky skin on face...?	Here's the situation.  I'm a 23 year old female and normally have no complexion issues, other than the oily skin and occasional pimple every now and then.  However, I've had this breakout of many little zits on my forehead  between my eyebrows for about 2 weeks now and it just won't seem to go away.  So, I've started using some Neutrogena acne face wash, and some astringent.  (Started on Sunday).        Well not only does that that area on my forehead STILL have the breakout, it, as well as around my mouth and chin are SOOOO dry and flaky.  It looks AWFUL.  I have put dabs of moisturizer as well as lotion on the areas and nothing seems to help.  I think the weather may have something to do with it as well, b/c it's been really cold here, and it's normally in the 70's.      PLEASE share your suggestions/experience for what I can do.  I appreciate it!  :)

Well one day i decided to cut my hair and dye it brown black.Well my stylist cut my hair too short cause she wasnt listening to me so I never went back. Now my hair gets too oily. I bought cheap shampoo to try and make it dry and not condition but none of thats working. The same day I take a bath my hair just stays oily even if I dont use conditioner. I am so confused. And I refuse to call the "so-called-friend" that messed up my hair!

Also do heated rollers work, what kind of effect do they have ??Does it mean that the more you pay the better the curlers will be .

20090205093107AA9OoEt	Beauty & Style;Hair	Why is my hair so unmanageable?	Every time I get out of the shower, I have to spend forever detangling my hair.  I spray detangler on it, then comb through (easily) until it becomes a little easier to work with.  I have tried doing a bunch of things differently: leaving conditioner in my hair for 5-10 minutes, using little/no heat to dry my hair, switching shampoos and conditioners regularly, using a deep oil treatment, not towel drying my hair, etc.etc.  I even thought that it might be the water used in my apartment, but I have showered elsewhere and still have the same problem.  I also get regular trims, however I am embarrassed to go to the salon because they always spend forever combing my hair out as well.  Does anyone know what I could do to fix this?  Also, my hair is medium length (just past my shoulders) and is closer to fine than thick.  Thanks!

20090205070843AAhtK1x	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Why do people get tattoos?	I was told that people that get or wear tattoos are very insecure. They need to attach themselves to something to feel better about themselves. They lack the ability to grow intellectually. Like barbarians they follow the pack much like sheep. They need to "Belong" to something.Instead they of growing intellectually they choose to paint themselves with cartoon images hoping to get the security they lack within. Most attempt images to cast fear to others but inside they are mentally trapped. Screaming out "Look at ME!" I am no one, and my Tattoos make me feel important, strong or what ever fantasy they perceive. But deep down inside they are lost. The images they select expose their deepest fears or desires.They are weak minded individuals that cannot grow without these painted images on their bodies.      This sense of belonging is similar to sport fans. Wearing team clothing    acting as if they are the players makes them feel better about themselves. I say whats wrong with that. Years ago before civilization came together tribal people needed tattoos to show which pack they were part of. Today people need to go back to Neanderthal times, after all killing and harming people seems to be the American way of Life. So I say "Get plastered with tattoos and grab a spear" Whats your opinion Oh mighty masses of cyberspace?

20090205075919AAqJghN	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How should I decorate a room, to give a REAL fashion environment?	I don't know how to put this in a better sentence.      What I want to do is actually trying to decorate a small room, not mine, and the room is actually temporary, it's for a big event, but what kind of stuff/decorations can I put inside to give it a fashion look?      Like, if you've been backstage in a runway show, what can you see?   Or in a fashion designing room, what can you see?   I want it to have a REAL fashion environment. Thanks!
20090205080131AA6IEwp	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is there a way to get the smell of cat pee/spray out of a Coach purse?	I just bought a Coach purse and I either sat it on something that was marked by a cat or the cat actually sprayed the purse. Either way, its awful. The cleaner Coach sells is no use. The purse is cloth with a leather strap and some metal hardware. Black in color. Should I just try and clean it with laundry detergent and let it air dry? Dry clean? Anyone have any ideas? This will teach me not to buy expensive handbags.

20090205083232AAG0gMW	Beauty & Style;Hair	Which straighteners would you suggest to use in North America?	I am addicted to straightening and own GHDs, however I travel a lot to Canada to visit family and cannot use these due to the voltage being much lower over there than here in the UK.       Can anyone suggest any brands that are good over in North America and how much they cost? I've bought several sets from Walmart during past trips, but none of them work anything like my GHDs. I know it's very vain, but I don't wanna do without straighteners everytime I go over there! So which are the best brands?      Thank you : )
