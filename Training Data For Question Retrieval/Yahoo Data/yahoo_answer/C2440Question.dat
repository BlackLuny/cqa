20090222200403AA7yUAs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my book so far?	heres what i wrote so far. tell me what you think please and thank you much.                                            Chapter 1         The ocean breeze blew through my long auburn hair and my legs dangled off the edge of the rocky cliff.   This was my new home. I had to try to accept that. I usually was good with changes.     But was this for the right reasons? I couldnt seem to find the answer to that. After mom died, dad became a wreck. He took on extra shifts at the hospital. I guess he was trying to drown the pain in work.   But he forgot about me in the process.     I was hurt too. Why couldnt he see that? I had permanent purple circles around my eyes, which were all worn out from crying, from the many sleepless nights. Anytime i closed my eyes, i could see my mothers dead body lying in that big wooden coffin    I didnt know why dad wanted to move to Evanston. There was nothing wrong with Los Angeles. We had a beautiful home, he had a perfect job and i was, well, as good as i could of even got.   He didnt get offered the job at Oceanside Medical Center in Evanston.   No, he called and asked for a position.    "Anywhere." he pleaded on that phone call i eavsdropped on. They finally offered him with a postion in the ER.    Of course, he took every shift they had to offer.     It was such a quick move too. Only took us less than a day to drive here and then the whole weekend to unpack. The house was already furnished.     But deep down i knew why dad wanted to move so quickly after moms death. The house in LA was filled with moms paintings and personal touches. Her spirit still lingered in the home. he couldnt stand another moment there.    I understood perfectly.    But here i was, sitting high on a cliff looking out over the Pacific Ocean.    A single tear fell from my eye and slid down my cheek. I stood from where i was planted and looked over the edge of the cliff.    I estimated it to be about 40 feet. Could that kill me? I thought it over and figured it would only end in a broken limb or two.   "Another day." i told myself. I'd have to write a suicide note first to explain it all to dad. i assumed it would go a bit like this:    Dear Father of mine,   It seems that my life is empty. I fit in no where and can relate to hardly any person my age. My nights are tiring and my eyes are far too worn out. I just dont see any further reason to continue this harsh, cruel, meaningless thing you call life. Now, i must say that there was happiness in my life before. Remember when i used to paint with mom. Yes, now that was happiness. But it seems that my best friend has parished and now it only seems suitable for the same to happen to me. Dont be sad and dont beat yourself up over this. You have a reason to continue your life. You have to stay alive for Gustav. Someone has to be there to feed him and take him for walks.    Well i wanna cut this goodbye short. I'll give your love to mother.           Love forever,            Amelia         Yes, that would be good. I turned my back to the ocean and headed home. It was getting dark and i would have to try to get some sleep because the next day i start Evanston High School.    Now that was something i really wasnt looking forward to. i hated having to be around other teenagers especially when i knew that i would never fit in with any of them. i was the quiet/shy type. I wasnt very good at making friends. It was hard to strike a conversation with me.       The house was dark when i arrived at my new home. Dads truck in the drive way so i figured he was already in bed.     I stopped in front of the end of the walkway and sighed.    "Home." i whispered before slowly and hesitantly walking up the pathway. The door was unlocked. I slowly turned the knob and made a space in the doorway only big enough to fit my slender figure through. I sighed in relief when i was safely in the house and quietly closed the door.
20090222195736AAQlGxr	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What you think of this poem?	I know it's not all that great so don't be bsing about it cause I'm sick and tired of people insulting my work when not all my work isn't all that bad...I get my inspiration from my life; past, present, and future along with the dreams I dream and sometimes my feelings...well here is my poem...      Bleed   By: Adam M. Snow      Your seed of lies   placed upon my soul makes me bleed inside.   For what you’ve done; you will surely die.    I can’t go on when I cry;   I just want to spread my wings and fly;   for I’m bleeding, though I can’t deny.      I see it in your eyes   that you truly want me to die.   I can’t defy these terms   whether I should live or   whether I should die.   Tell me, I want to know why?      I refuse to bleed anymore by your lies.   Untie my hands now so that I can fly   so high into the sky   so that I can be evermore   free till the day I die.

If all the world and love were young,    And truth in every shepherd's tongue,   These pretty pleasures might me move   To live with thee and be thy love.       Time drives the flocks from field to fold,   When rivers rage and rocks grow cold;   And Philomel becometh dumb;    The rest complains of cares to come.       The flowers do fade, and wanton fields    To wayward winter reckoning yields:    A honey tongue, a heart of gall,    Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.       The gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses,    Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies    Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten,—    In folly ripe, in reason rotten.       Thy belt of straw and ivy buds,    Thy coral clasps and amber studs,    All these in me no means can move    To come to thee and be thy love.       But could youth last and love still breed,    Had joys no date nor age no need,    Then these delights my mind might move    To live with thee and be thy love.          I was thinking maybe "Is fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall"   But is that an example?

20090222202109AAWvt0m	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you please review my story, so far?	Welcome to the life of Hayley.         Hayley Zero, yes that’s really my last name, my life adds up to my last name zero, meaning zero fun, nothing interesting ever happens. Up until now I have been your average high school girl. If you were to ask most people who I was they would most likely say:   “Nope, never heard of her,” and that’s because I try to keep a low profile. Even though that’s kind of hard considering the fact that I am the school giant. Well at least for a girl, most of the guys are taller.  The people who do know me either call me by my name, or    “The freaky giant girl,” those people are the ones who don’t like me. If it were up to me, I’d do away with the hurtful names, even though “freaky giant girl” doesn’t sound so hurtful, it is. I try and ignore it, but every once in a while it still gets to me. I dress and act the way I want, and if the “cool” kids in school don’t like it, oh well.       If you were to ask me what my favorite feature on my body was, I would have to say my hair, though most people don’t even consider it a feature. At the moment it’s bleach blonde with yellow and neon-orange tips, it has several layers and it is just the way I like it.    Now my eyes on the other hand, are the most boring feature on this planet, they’re a brown, not even a pretty brown; they’re really dark to where they looked almost black. To make them even remotely pretty I have to put a ton of make-up on. Though not enough to make me look like the school slut, but just enough to make them this orange color, which reminds of a tiger.    I have one true best friend, and she would be Rachel Damron. Many of our other “friends” like to laugh at us when they see us walking threw the hall, mainly because Rachel is probably the shortest girl in school. Rachel and I are polar opposite’s maybe that’s why we are able to be best friends. Don’t get me wrong, I do have other friends, but Rachel is the most important to me. I can tell her anything. She’s been there for me through thick and thin, she was even there for me when I went through my “I miss you” phase (a song by Miley Cyrus) when my brother died. Even when I hear the song I cry sometimes, because it reminds me of my brother. Rachel is also the only person, I have told about my dreams lately.    My dreams, so vivid and colorful and perfect, and all because of a guy, my dream guy I guess you could say. My dreams have been so perfect lately, a lot better than my real life, the only thing, I don’t even know who my dream guy is. Any time I think I am going to find out, I wake up, and then reality hits me. Rachel sometimes laughs at me, because I get so worked up over a guy, who is in my head, but there’s chemistry between us, I can feel it. Even if he’s not real, I’m in love with him. He has to exist somewhere out there, and I’ve made it my goal to find him. If I don’t, I think I might die.    Way to be melodramatic Hayley.   “Hayley, get the goddamn phone,” my dad called from the living room, “It’s your lover.”   I picked up the phone that was lying next to my bed.   “Hello?” even though I was pretty sure who it was.   “You’re dad sounded excited,” Rachel was being really sarcastic, “what’s his deal?”   “Well first off, I wasn’t the one to answer the phone, two it’s the end of the game and three it’s eleven thirty on a school night.” I rolled my eyes; this was a very obvious answer.    “Well he still could have watched his language.” She knew better than I did that that would never happen in a million years, my dad’s mouth was ten times worse than a sailors and he used to be one, “so how are things at prison?"   “Well my mom still hasn’t come back; I don’t think she ever will Dad ran her off for good this time, if I ever see her again it’ll be a miracle. And we all know I don’t believe in those, especially after Henry died. Stupid ******* drunk driver, everybody knows not to drink and drive, did I tell you that the bastard is getting out on Friday?” If there was one person on this Earth who I loathed more than my father it had to be the guy who killed my brother.   “Yeah, you happened to mention it, I’m sorry.”    “Its okay, look I better get going before the game ends and my warden comes and checks on me, see you tomorrow?”    “Of course you will, first day of school. YAY!” I had to laugh, that was the most sarcastic yay in the universe.   “Alright see you then…”   Before I even finished my sentence the line went dead.   Great.            Chapter 2: The fight.      “Hayley Zero! Get your lazy *** out here!” My dad bellowed from the living room.    I knew better than to ignore the warden, so I went. Rachel and I had been calling my dad that since we entered high school, he treated me more like a prisoner than his daughter.   The warden, I mean dad used to be pretty laid back, and my favorite parent, but ever since Henry died, he hasn’t let me have a life. Not only has he not let me have a life, his personality did a major 360. He became an alcoholic himself, and an abusive bastard. Th

20090222202205AAmEv4k	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What does this poem mean?	To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time      Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,   Old Time is still a-flying:    And this same flower that smiles to-day   To-morrow will be dying.    The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,   The higher he's a-getting,    The sooner will his race be run,   And nearer he's to setting.    That age is best which is the first,   When youth and blood are warmer;    But being spent, the worse, and worst   Times still succeed the former.    Then be not coy, but use your time,   And while ye may, go marry:    For having lost but once your prime,   You may for ever tarry.          I can't analyze this. I've been reading this for 40 minutes right now and I don't comprehend.

I'm huge on Macro and wide shots. I don't need the zoom as much as some people, but having the basic property is nice to have on occasion. Anyways, should I buy a brand new body and a used lens (what lens do you think would best suit my preferences?)

It may even be a wedding that she is at. Oh, I also think this book takes place in England but that could be wrong.      I wish I could remember more than that but I just can't.  I don't even remember the author.  Could be Sophia Kinsella, Lauren Weisberger or someone like them.  It's driving me nuts!! :)

Nothing different or out of the blue. She used the same routine she always did. She took a shower, brushed her teeth, and went to bed. But that night changed her life dramatically. At three o' clock in the morning, she was awoken by somebody. She was so confused as to what was happening, she didn't even try to fight back when they put a hand over her mouth and tied her hands and legs. It was all happening quick and she was trying to wake up. When she finally came to, she was being pushed into a van. She tried to fight then, but it was too late, she was bound and they were strong.       As they pulled out, the one in the back with her, whispered in her ear that he would remove his hand if she wouldn't scream. She slowly nodded her head in compliance. What choice did she have? He removed his hand and she turned her head to look at him. She noticed two things. One, she knew him. And two, he had a gun on his belt. She tried to think of where she could have seen him before. After considering several possibilities, it hit her. He worked for Jake, whom she had borrowed a significant amount of money from. She had never had business with this man, but she had seen him at Jake's office. His name was David. But what was he going to do to her? Where were they going? These questions and more were interrupted when he starting talking to her.      "Do you know who I am?" he asks.      "Yes," she manages to stutter out, "what do you want with me?"      "You have ignored our warning letters, and Jake is tired of waiting. He said no more chances. So he sent us to kill you," he stated matter-of-factly as if he didn't care at all.      Jenny couldn't speak. She couldn't even breath. But for some reason, she had a sense of relief. Not because her life was going to be over soon. Just the fact that knowing what was going on relieved her. But that feeling didn't last long. In an instant she was facing reality again.       David had stopped talking and was now staring at her. Watching to see how she handled that piece of information. It wasn't good. She looked as though she was in shock. But she wasn't, somewhere deep in the back of her mind, she knew that this was going to happen. She had received numerous letters warning her to pay them, but she didn't have the money.       After reality sunk in, she was filled with curiosity. She had to ask questions. So she composed herself as much as she could and looked at David again. He was still staring. She mustered up what little courage she had right now and slowly started the conversation again.

Wrote this in ten minutes so please be gentle on spelling and punctuation kay?      "You hate me don't you?"   A lonely gale magnified the silence. The duo regarded each other across the divide and for innumerable lifetimes, none broke the calm.   "No."   He tried to read the expression on her face-or rather her lack of one...nothing there.   "Then what is it Maya, what's all this supposed to accomplish?"   Pregnant silence.   She sized him up indifferently; with the airy aloofness one might accord a mildly interesting portrait on a wall worth of some notice. A slow smile creased her face momentarily as she deigned him a minor threat and saw it fit to allow her sword arm purchase, a move easily misinterpreted as lowering her guard. Her royal blues appeared to glow eerily in the shadow of rapidly gathering night.   He sighed deeply to himself and shook his head.   "You know, if thou deem it not beneath your royal person,” he mocked lightly, hoping to at least get a rise from her,” We could sit down and talk about this. You know; like responsible adul..."   She smiled, an expression that didn't violate the coolness of her eyes.” We could try, but it wouldn't work."   "And exactly why would that be?"   With the annoying air of one trying to explain rudimentary Physics to a 10 year old, she yielded,” If you haven't noticed, every time we meet nowadays, the situation always corrodes down to the same thing." She said indicating her katana and his weapon, Erebus (the mysterious blade said to have been forged from the darkest shadows, collected and tempered in the deepest darkest regions of the Afterworld)   He frowned at the truth in her words. “Not to forget the that your 17 and I'm not even sure what my age is anymore.” Her eyes glinted slyly at him from behind her curtain of snow-white hair, “So we can't really discuss anything like responsible adults, can we?"   Woman had a point. Still...   God Maya, what happened to you? He thought to himself. Her eyes held neither passion nor purpose, just a distinct lack of warmth and notice. Somehow, he suspected that he didn't properly register in her conscious mind.   And if the eyes truly were the windows to one's soul, then this was an exercise in futility. She was too far-gone...

20090222204814AAFTr4k	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Hey would this interest you if it happened in a novel or weird you out (PLEASE READ!)?	I decided it would make my story more interesting if one of the two main character females is actually bisexual and has a secret cruch on the other main female character.      Of course this would never be official and I would just hint at it through out the book but i figure it would make it more interesting and would make their relaitonship more real.      They're supposed to be rivals turned best friends then back to enemies again (the more bad *** one is the bisexual one i think)      anyways would you be a little weirded out if you picked up on a hint of this and drop the book or would you be like "huh interesting!" and keep reading?       it is in no way the main plot of the book (there's only some romance and it's between the straight female lead and a guy who is actually a bad guy who is just using her woo!)      so yeah i thought it would be cool to have some interesting "deeper relationship" between two girls even if it's one-sided (i personally love unrequited love, jealousy, etc in books)       so would you be weirded out if you happened to pick up the hints and drop the book, or would you focus on the actual story and think huh that's kind of interesting cool?

20090222213341AAJaGc3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this book I've written so far?	Naoki was lying in her red chair, leaning in a slouch sort of position,    wondering what to write for next book. Naoki got the most inspiration   from sitting in that particular red chair, lined with pink velvet ribbon and now beginning to recover from some stitching Naoki’s mom has done to fix the cat’s wild scratches, and no other would give her that shock of idea when anything began to wander around in her head. Naoki tapped the pencil on the desk. Tip, tip, tip. Naoki had no idea what to do…    Naoki’s eyes widened as she began scribbling notes onto her thought notebook. A wide grin formed on Naoki’s face as she wrote down what could be the next book she could submit for a writing contest at her school.          Stephanie looked around her. She sensed somebody close by and hiding in the maple trees that surrounded her. She saw a shadow approach her. Claws stuck out of the oddly shaped fingers of the creature. Teeth were clenched together in the creature’s mouth. All of a sudden          …was all Naoki could write down right now. Her eyes sagged and she backed out of the red chair and drifted toward her bed. She fell backwards as she heard the bed springs make the familiar strange sound of rust and weakened metal. ”Oh…does my back ache!” exclaimed Naoki. Naoki’s black-brown hair spread across the bed sheets as she began to enter a dream of having one of her books published.

20090222214335AAendc3	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your perspective on this short story?	“It is not that we don’t want to understand, nor is it that we can’t understand The question lies in are we ready to understand. That is the fault of humanity. Even if we understood could we truly comprehend and accept the truth, which in relation to us can just as well be an illusion, a ghost. But the main question is what is there to understand? ….. Life? Death? Family? or juts to understand one self?”         “How long has it been”…………..   The ray of light penetrating the curtain into the dark and foreboding room lying down onto the soft cover warming it small piece of land. Sound penetrating the stone walls, into his mind, deep into the depths oh his conscience. He tries to move his hand, to lift his head, to even remember his own name. Slowly the covers rise, first a finger, then the hand. Eyes open slowly and then shut, afraid of the light. Slowly they reopen making friends with the light, letting it inside their depths. He rises, why is he here? The question on his mind. Slowly he walks over. Arms grabbing ahead, fingers wrapping around the handle. Coffee? No. Walking back, away, to his stainless white sheets, away from all the people running circles, away from the mad world , covering his head, he fades away , into his dreams.       Head lifting. The air thinning and yet weighting down on it, the rain. The soft, gentle leather penetrated by the cold soothing rain, penetrating the cotton layers below, stroking the weathered skin beneath. He feels lost, looking around these familiar places, worn-out places, feeling lost in this mad world. In his mad world. His soaked leather coat softly floats down onto the ground. As time freezes, lights smudge; his head beginning to spin or is it the world spinning around him? His nerves tense like guitar strings, muscles harden, the familiar jog slowly becoming into a run, into a sprint. All the colors blinding his eyes His senses, and yet the cold expressionless stairs don’t go unnoticed. He runs going nowhere, becoming a see through sheet of paper. His mind trapped away, not knowing where he is going, not knowing his own NAME. Into the blinding light. Eyes open he stares into the jaws of a great white, then a jaguar ready to pounce and devour him slowly. Then the white light. …………    The horrible sound of tires screaming “Stop”, the expressionless stares. He tries to move his hand, to lift his head, to remember his purpose. But his mind is too far away, fading, into a void where nothing exists, except for darkness, a darkness no one could understand.          “How long has it been since the last time I died”    He tries to move his hand, to lift his head, to even remember his own name. Slowly eyes open, into the darkness in the room. He slowly lifts his head. His lips carry a smile. He walks over to the mirror, his eyes blood shot red. Then he walks to his dresser and gets dressed in his best suit. The clock says 12:00. He glances at it but gives it no care. He walks out of the door into the night.       In the depths of the night 3 shots echo through the streets…………………………….. The stained white sheets, (no, not white anymore) lie crumbled on the hid bed. Awaiting his return in the morning, as he wonders the streets soaked in the rain … in the pain of his victim. His mind erased, no more alive he wonders the dark in circles, with an expressionless face.

20090222222011AAywcIq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Historical, interracial fiction?	Hi everyone, I'm writing a short story that is yet to be titled which tells the story of a young black violinist who travels to Italy for a classical music symposium over the summer where she meets a young village boy who falls in love with her violin playing and most importantly...her. Theirs is a brief romance where she returns home to the USA and he stays in Italy and they keep writing letters to one another, only to discover heartbreak and love's flame die down.       I'm thinking of setting it during the 1940's WWII but I don't know how realistic that would be, should I make it modern instead of a "historical" romance? I just got inspired by listening to some classical violin right now...so I'm kind of on a roll..      any suggestions? Would you read it? Thanks for the replies...

At dawn the ridge emerges massed and dun  In the wild purple of the glowering sun,  Smouldering through spouts of drifting smoke that shroud  The menacing scarred slope; and, one by one,  Tanks creep and topple forward to the wire.  The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed  With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear,  Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.  Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear,  They leave their trenches, going over the top,  While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,  And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,  Flounders in mud. O Jesu, make it stop!    Thanks a lot - any ideas appreciated

20081115201650AAH0dO3	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	How to avoid blurry photos indoors without using the flash?	I mainly shoot in aperture priority mode (still getting my feet wet with manual mode) and whenever I set the f-stop to anything higher than 5 or 6 to obtain some depth of field, it causes the shutter speed to increase to over 1 second so all of my indoor photos tend to be a tad blurry. Now I know this is because I am using apeture priority mode and the indoor lighting isn't ideal, but is there anything I can do to prevent the blur without using my camera's pop-up flash (it's very harsh). Will changing the ISO help at all? And yes, I use a tripod occassionally but it doesn't help if the subject is the one that's moving, ya know? Am I going to have to suffer through the awful flash until I can get some better lighting, or is there something else I can do?      Thanks.

20090203130504AAslkaM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Critique the opening to my story?	It's something I just threw together last night and I'm not sure to run with it or not. Just tell me what you think and what I can do to make it better, eh? Thanks! Oh, and I think the overall plot will be road trip-esque.            “Good morning my beautiful ray of sunshine!”       At first, I was almost positive I was dreaming. When I glanced over at the vivid, glowing numbers on the clock next to my bed with blurry, exhausted, blue eyes I just prayed that I was.     6:34 AM.     I moaned in frustration.     “Fornicate me in the a** and call me Sally…” I rolled over on my right side and buried myself under a large blanket, hoping to find a switch to make the idiot go away.     “Oh! Sally! Oh! Oh God!”    Looks like I misplaced that switch…    Somebody happened to jump on top of me and tried to fulfill my sarcastic request. At that point, I pretty much gave up on sleeping, and in one good move I managed to get Jasper, the butt yelling ‘Sally’ (and one of my best friends), off my bed and onto my messy bedroom floor.     I leaned over the edge of my bed and giggled.     “B**ch.”     “Rude!”    “You’re rude! Pushing me off the bed and whatnot…” Jasper stuck out his tongue.      “You woke me up at six in the morning!” I crossed my arms in defense.     Jasper smiled sheepishly, “Six-thirty, actually.”    I blew the hair out of my face, “This is gonna be a long two weeks, ain’t it?”    Japser beamed. “I can’t wait.”     In the silence as Jasper’s words played around amongst themselves in the air, I decided to try to gain conciseness of my right mind to where I can at least understand what‘s happening, doing so by observing the surroundings.     For starters, I was in my own room. That’s always good.  Also, the sky is pink and orange -- and last time I checked it was supposed to be blue…I think. Hmm, you know what? How about we just cross that bridge when we come to it…oh, and Jasper’s here. That’s odd. He’s supposed to be in Wichita getting the car for the tri--wait. No way. Oh my God, is it today?  I opened my mouth to speak, but Jasper beat me to it.    “Say, where’s Kenzie at?”
