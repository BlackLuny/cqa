20090203072855AA2xNtq	Sports;Football (American)	Rule question about the first score of the Super Bowl?	On the first drive of the Super Bowl, the Steelers drove down the field and nearly scored a TD when Ben Rothlisberger was tackled just short of the goal line (after the Cardinals' challenge).      My question is about the offensive lineman in that goalline scrum.  As Rothlisberger approached the goal line, his forward progress was slowed from the Arizona defenders.  That's when the offensive lineman grabbed Big Ben and tried to push/pull him into the end zone.  Why is that not a penalty?      I know it used to be illegal for a teammate to help the ballcarrier make forward progress.  For example, in the Ice Bowl, QB Bart Starr scored the GW TD on a sneak, but RB Chuck Mercein didn't know that Starr was keeping the ball.  That's why Mercein raised his hands when he ran up on Starr -- he wasn't indicating TD, he was showing the refs he wasn't pushing Starr.      Did the NFL remove this penalty?  Or are the referees not enforcing it?      Thanks.

I barely see black fighters that are able to successfully submit fighters. I won't include black fighters from latin countries because guys like Anderson Silva, Hector Lombard, Jacare(world class BJJ) have shown to have really good submissions.   Its the black american fighters and black European fighters. I dont know if Alistar Overreem is black but he is a pretty good a subbing people. But in many fighter i have seen black fighters not being able to submit guys and when they have a good position to submit someone. I have only seen like a few submission finishes from black american fighters. One of the best armbars i have seen was from black american fighter Din Thomas who got a sick armbar on Jeremy Stephens and looked like he was going to break Stephens arm. Black fighters also seem to give up some times when they get grounded on thier back. Not all i mean guys like Rashad Evans and Jon Jones know how to get back up since they are really good wrestlers.    I heard in the black american community that it is wussy to beat someone by submission. I don't agree i think its childish and stupid but many things that come out of black american community is stupid. I hate when black people blame others for there problems. Other people got it bad too Latin people dont have any better than blacks but alot of Latinos work hard and keep moving up.

20070303120938AACiitI	Sports;Baseball	How much is this bat i have worth?	I got this bat from some guy on the Chigaco white sox team (i was too little to know who). It is wooden, and you can tell were the pine tar was, but you cant really feel it anymore. I am pretty sure this is a practice bat, but i dont really know for sure. It is a Louisville slugger with Mark Johnson's signiture on it. It isnt signed in marker, but branded or carved into the wood. It has the MLB symbol on it and it has a few other things on it. About how much is this worth? cuz i have nooo idea.

20070805110049AANESO5	Sports;Wrestling	People against Bobby lashley ??	Why do most people hate Lashley so much, i mean he's WAY better than Cena of course and he's a well built wrestler...   i agree that Lashley's mic skills suck, but as a wrestler, he's very talented and he's VERY hard working too .......   So what's wrong with him,. why does everyone hate him so much...if its because of his steroid use, then A LOT of wrestlers use 'em too, and mic skills aren't the only thing you need to have to become a good wrestler, its the wrestling ability and skills that count the most.......

Maybe this is at the heart of my hatred for Shaq, lol.... but it just drives me absolutely crazy when I hear on Sportscenter "Shaq was 8 of 12 from the floor tonight (Meanwhile they show him dunking 3 seperate times)" and than they'll follow it up with something like "Shaq has been shooting a League best 57% from the field this season"  I'm like you morons! Dunking is NOT Shooting!  They should take the dunk away from the Field Goals Attempted and Field Goals Made category because its ridiculous. You've got all of these guys leading the League in shooting percentage a bunch of overgrown gorillas that couldn't hit a 12 foot jump shot to save their life if their life depended on it.

I ride a yz125 that I can handle easily, but I think if I rode a bigger bike they would be harder to control, they look harder to ride. So are they more difficult to ride, turning and controlling wise?   Thanks!

20080409063338AA8v8zf	Sports;Running	Come posso migliorare il mio risultato sui 1000 metri...?	... premetto che ho 12 anni e che non mi sono mai allenata in vita mia a correre, soltanto qualche volta sul tapis roulant ma non lo conterei neanche... comunque al nostro professore di ed. fisica è venuta l'idea di farci correre oggi i 1000 metri misurandoci il tempo. Prima ci ha fatto correre 9 minuti per riscaldarci, e quando ho terminato di correre questi 9 minuti non ero affatto stanca e potevo benissimo arrivare anche a 10 senza fatica  esenza fiatone. Poi quando ci ha fatto partire per la prova dei 1000 metri, sono arrivata al traguardo con gli occhi che mi luccicavano dalla fatica, la vista appannata, il fegato che mi scoppiava e i polmoni che nn sentivo più... mi sono anche spaventata perchè avevo un senso di svenimento... sono caduta sul conetto che segnava il traguardo, davanti al profe e urlando "BASTAA!!!".   Il mio tempo, senza mai allenarmi come vi ho già detto, è intorno ai 5 min.       La mia domanda è: Per quet'estate voi mi consigliate di allenarmi correndo in città?...

I can start two RBs, and I have:  Earnest Graham vs Packers, Jonathan Stewart vs Falcons, Chris Johnson vs Vikings, Steve Slaton vs Jaguars.   This is a non-PPR league, and 10 rushing yards = 1 point, so carries will be huge.  Right now I am using Graham and Stewart, but I could see myself using Chris Johnson or Slaton also....Slaton is the only RB who is not in a timeshare, but he's an unproven rookie, and last week vs the Titans could be a fluke.  Please help.

Unlike all other girls I know of, I am not looking forward to this. My teammate's mother told me that when her older daughter became curvy so stopped running as well and had a harder time with cross country and was slowed down. She was afraid of this happening to her younger daughter. Does this happen a lot? Could this potentially happen to me? Please I am really afraid of losing something I love and that I am good at.

20090220152739AACAMzx	Sports;Horse Racing	Horse- riding- barrel racing- advice?	ok so ive been barrel racing for about 6 years (I am now 14) and I've been riding my "grandmothers" (shes a family friend but shes like 1 to me lol) sinse now and the horse i rode mosty recently bowed a tendon and hes 39 so i cant really ride him for a while and so i just give him pleasure care. My dad recently bouight a quarter horse "bruiser" from one of the guys that boards at the old run doewn ranch where she lives. (bruiser was only 500 dollars, thats cheap for a horse btw)  He is a family friend also and the horse is 5 years old and has had basic training.....         ANYWAY!   So I compete in local monthly shows and have been able to win a fourth and a fifth the past two months. My problem is, I want to know some techniques to help me turn him into a really good barrel horse. He is very fast on trail rides, but I cant get him to gallop the pattern, only canter, and he does NOT like being pulled at the mouth so its hard to get him to turn. Ive been taking the pattern slow (at a trot) to familiarize him with it but whenever i speed it up to a canter he wont turn very close to the barrels. I also use inside leg pressure, and practice figure 8s. He also has trouble getting on the left lead, how is that fixable? he has no trouble in joints or anything, just had a full vet check. So anyways, any advice at all on how to improve his training would be soo helpful! He is an unbelievable horse with the greatest personality!       He is 15 1/5 hands and has a big head and his coat is documented as chestnut because of his dark mane and tail but i think of him more as a brown roan haha if thats imaginable.      So ANY advice is great! And yes, i know i wrote WAY too much but i have nothing else to do lol      thank you! easy 10 points! (for the most advice)

I am a pretty good defender, my teammates even say i am arguably the best player on the team when i am playing my natural postion. and their is about 4 players next year that are going to be 10th graders that are better than me(i think at least two are going to varsity) do you think ill make it, here are my skill levels on a grade scale at my age   Dribbling-B+   Shooting-A   Driving-B   Defense-A-   Post Offense-C+(since i played the 4)   Speed-A-   Strength-B+    Rebounding-B   Passing-C(gotta get better their)      and also what postion do u think i will play
