20090219181345AAhhJyj	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Is this good? I need one more paragraph but ran outta ideas.?	My definition of a symbol is an object that has great significance to a person. What I look for in a symbol is love, power, fun, respect, and comfort. I’ve found that I can find love, fun, respect, and comfort at my grandparents’ house. That house has great importance to me, and my life would be different without it. The Importance of the house is that it’s a place that’ll always be there. I know I will always have a place to stay, also it’s a place for memories.  Some of the memories I remember there is that it’s the last place I seen my great grandpa before he passed away, Its’ where I witnessed my nana’s 96th birthday, it’s the first place I seen my nephews and cousins, and where I last seen my sister before she went to Iraq. At my grandparents house I get my comfort when my family gets together to celebrate everything. We celebrate birthdays, the eagles, holidays, graduations, almost anything. When we’re celebrating we usually have a big dinner with some macaroni and cheese, candy yams, chicken, corn bread, spinach, potato salad, and a lot of desserts. To start our day we all gather around the living for prayer.  I get my fun at my grandparents’ house when we get together to watch the Eagles, Phillies, and the Sixers play. I also have fun when we play monopoly, connect four, life, and charades, or when we go outside to play football, kickball, or baseball. In the house everybody loves one another. We show our love by getting together on Sundays and having fun. In my grandparents’ we show our respect by following the rules. Some of the rules are that you have to eat all your food on your plate, clean up after yourself, no cursing, etc. Love, fun, respect, and comfort are all symbols that represent my grandparents' house. The symbols their home represent have shaped my life; My life would be different without them.          Love, fun, respect, and comfort are all symbols that represent my grandparents' house. The symbols their home represent have shaped my life; My life would be different without them.

For my English 112 class we have to write an argumentative essay that argues the definition of a word or phrase. Some examples that we can't use include marriage, abortion, love, war, etc. We have to take the word and argue a definition for it that is new or that people wouldn't ordinarily think of. Like with war, we read an essay that argued that war is "an invention by man as an outlet for aggression."    I can't come up with anything that I could write a whole paper about. I was considering abortion (although I know that is played out) until the professor said that we can't do that one.    Also, I am very interested in environmental and ecology topics as that is my intended major. However I will take any topic that I could use to write a decent length paper.    Any ideas?

20090219230359AA5t4GU	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	GPA question! Please help!?	A little background first:    So I am a freshman in college, it's my first year at a university and I got off to a rough start. I moved in from a different city several thousand miles away, up from southern california to Los Angeles. I didn't know anyone here and I had to dorm. My first set of roomies were chosen at random and I ended out moving out due to being threatened by my particular roomie. But the transition of moving out from my old dorm to my new dorm was very stressful and exceedingly tedious, as it was during the time of my finals. I got a second roomie and a new dorm, but my new roomie moved out shortly before finals began, leaving even more stress when I had to leave for winter break, as to whether or not there were people in the dorm while I went home to visit family.   Now, things are a lot better and I have gotten new classes. However, during the period of transitioning, stress, and moving around, I happened to get two C's in my biology and math classes, resulting in a 2.9/3.0 gpa. I figured I wouldnt notify my parents until I recieved the proper grades I usually get, from a new semester. However, my parents, who are of a strict sort, have asked to recieve a copy of my last semester's grades, seeking a discount on student auto insurance.       How should I go about approaching them with the knowledge that they expect better than a 2.9/3.0 gpa?    They obviously know I had a rough time, but also believe I should be doing better, regardless. What should I do? I'm afraid of what they would have to say or what they may do.
20090220002524AA43f6r	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Could someone check my grammar/sentence structure, just a short paragraph?	I'm writing a 2 page paper in History about the historical accuracy of the film revolution. This is what i have so far as an intro. It looks ok to me, but admittedly i'm not great at english so please enlighten me if their are any glaring mistakes. THANKS!      “Revolution”, directed by Hugh Hudson and starring Al Pacino was released in 1985. The film itself was a complete and utter failure, in large part due to bad acting and even worse dialogue throughout the entire piece. However, despite “Revolution’s” shortcomings the film does an excellent job of accurately portraying the revolutionary war leading up to, during, and after the war itself. That’s not to say the film is completely accurate. It does have it’s shortcomings in that department, but those are few and far between. Suffice to say that you would have a hard time finding a more historically accurate film than “Revolution“.

20090220004828AA6qi8p	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Could I start school all over again w/o previous reords on transcript?!?	Hi,   I'm 21 years old and I'm doing pre-med right now at a University of CA school (Biology major). Last year I had a tragic death in my close family from a car accident. Following that incident I started getting very depressed, my grades slipped and I was put on academic probation. Unfortunately I'm still struggling this quarter with depression and I'm afraid I won't meet the GPA requirements and will get expelled.      My question is, If I take a break from school for a couple of months and see counseling and get help with my depression could I start  school all over again? I know I won't get into a 4 year school again, but what about starting in a community college and then applying to another 4 year school down the line? If so, would the schools know about my past and my record?      Also please don't say stuff like I need to try and do better this quarter to have a chance of passing because I know it's already too late; and I certainly don't want to let the future schools know about my past situation because I don't want to revisit these times.      Thanks all

Prolonged drought along the Yangtze has reduced China's longest river to record lows, triggering a debate over the Three Gorges dam's ability to generate power, state-media said yesterday.   The Yangtze fell to its lowest level last yrs since records began in 1877, but a dam official told the Xinhua news agency that power generation in the Three Gorges area would not be affected.   "There have never been two successive yrs when a serious drop in the amount of water flowing into the mainstream of the Yangtze has occurred," said the official. "So, I believe it is unlikely there will be a significant drop in the in flow of water into the Three Gorges Reservoir from the upper reaches this year."   Buy observers say such arguments are based on historical data and fail to consider the more recent issue of climate change.   Over 2.6 million people upsteam from the dam have been facing water shortages since late February, according to the agency.

20070120174238AAHFiGV	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Do you agree that we need to renew driver license at all? Where does the money go?	We have to renew car tag every year and why do we need to renew driver license too? I think department of motor vehicle should only for people who need to take driver license exams, people who got problems with their driver license such as probation and whatnot, and people from other states who want to change their driver licenses.   Do you agree? I really disagree with renewing driver license every 5 or 10 years because it is unnecessary, money wasting and a hassle. Imagine you have to pay about $20/5 years since you are 17 years old and times the age you are going to live, e.g. let's say you are going to live 'till you're 77 yrs old, so 77-17= 60years, then 60/5=12, 12*$20= $240.  That if the fee is the same in the future, maybe they increase the fee in the future.  Also, the people who works at DMV are very rude and unprofessional. And, why do they need your social security? Can you trust those people with your social security?

20070506164453AAH33Yn	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	So I got my final grades for this past college semester...?	I saw my final grades, and noticed that one of my grades was a"S" which stands for satisfactory completion of the course. However, I noticed that my GPA didn't go any higher or lower, so I take it that at most schools a grade like this doesn't carry any quality points that affect GPA? This kind of makes me upset if that is the case, b/c if the class would've counted, my GPA would be at the right level to transfer into a better school, now I'm .025 points behind where I hoped I would've been. Before I continue, let me say I'm not the best student, I'm in the process of repairing my GPA, so this is kind of letdown for me. I would've dropped the course if I knew about the grading system, but the class started 2 weeks after the last drop date. It's like wow I did great in the class, but it doesn't count in a way...very weird to me. It needs to be if you get a "S" it should be a "A" and if you get a "U"=unsatisfactory, you get a "F"

On June 27, 2007, I will find out if I was chosen to enter a nursing program at a local community college.  The community college's nursing program is based on a lottery.  If I am chosen, I will be entering the program this Fall.  I go for two years and then transfer to the university for the last year.  During the last year, I can work and get paid as a nurse.(This route is cheaper, & apparently better in a clinical experience.)      I am applying to the university's nursing program in October.  The admission into that program relies upons GPA and test scores.  If I apply, I am 95% sure I will get in.  The program starts this next spring 08 and lasts for 3yrs.  (This route is more expensive but better with nursing theory.)      If I did get selected from the community college's program, should I go?        I am also thinking of applying to medical school when I attain my degree. Do you think my choice of school will influence my chances of being accepted to medical school in the future?

Ragtime was composed for the piano and emphasized a "ragged" style of music, syncopation.      3.

As in other art forms, such as dance and drama, improvisation in music means that it is created spontaneously or on the spur of the moment.      6.One of the most famous jazz musicians of our time, louis Armstrong, began his career by playing on street coners and in cafes in New Orleans.         7.

It's extremely sad, and I cried while writing it, so I hope it's good. I was wondering if anyone would proofread it for me? I read over it a bunch of times and saw no mistakes, but I may be missing some. I'd greatly appreciate it. :) Make suggestions too, or if something sounds funny...   Here is my essay...      Summer in Texas    It was the end of my 5th grade school year in May of 2004, and I was looking forward to having a wonderful summer before my first year of middle school. Little did I know that all my plans were about to change. Usually, I have a spectacular summer. I’d travel to places, I’d see my friends, and I’d have a fun. However, the summer of 2004 would forever change that tradition and prove to be life changing.    My life changing experience started one day when I came home from school. I walked into the kitchen and I saw my mother crying. I despised seeing her cry. She never cries, so I knew something major must’ve been up. She immediately told me her father, who lived in Texas, was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer, and he only had about 3 months to live. I’d always been really close to my family, even the relatives that didn’t live near me, so this really affected me. I ran up to my room and cried until I fell asleep. I loved my Grandpa and I was not ready to lose him for anything.   I knew I was going to lose my Grandpa, but I thought I wasn’t ever going to have the chance to say goodbye. My mother came in my room with my sister, Hannah. She told us we’d be leaving for Texas before school was out for the summer. I didn’t like the idea for I was going to miss my graduation, but I was glad I was going to be able to see my Grandpa one last time. We made a plan that we would leave the following week, driving to Texas.   The following week came quickly. We left early in the morning, saying goodbye to my father, who stayed home. We drove 2 of the longest days of my life. The car was extremely cramped and we continuously had to eat at fast food restaurants. On the upside, we drove through Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and straight into Texas. My Grandpa lived at the very south part of Texas. He lived in Beaumont. Finally, after two days of driving over two thousand miles we reached his house. It was after midnight, but he was there to greet us. It was early June at this time, and it was extremely hot during the summer in Texas.   The hot days in Texas did not make our lives any easier. We were taking care of my Grandpa day by day. He was still strong at this time and able to go about a semi-normal life. My older brother, David, came home on leave from the Navy. He came to visit so he could help out my Grandpa. My Grandpa owned a green beach house on Crystal Beach. We visited there quite often because he loved it there. He wanted to remodel it so it would be stronger, since it was built in 1960. Those were the fun days we all spent with him. He would watch us go fishing in the ocean, and he’d eat the fish we caught. He’d show us all these wonderful places and take us walking on the beach.   After June was over, I began to miss those days where he’d take us to the beach and fishing. He began getting really weak to where he couldn’t walk anymore. We had to drive two hours to Houston almost every day to take him to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. They would treat him with chemotherapy, trying to make him live longer. During the month of July, he began to forget the littlest everyday necessities. He forgot how to eat and drink for himself. He forgot where he was, who he was, and why he was there. It was one the most horrible sights I’d ever seen. I knew my Grandpa as a very strong man. He wasn’t someone who enjoyed having people do everything for him.    As my Grandpa became weaker, and we had to do everything for him, we hired a Hospice Nurse, nurse who comes to your house everyday to check on you. She’d visit quite often. It was nearing the end of July by now, and there was no way my Grandpa could do anything on his own. I remember waking up in the middle of the night hearing him in terrible pain. I couldn’t bear to listen to it. It made my heart sink and filled my eyes with tears. Every day, it’d get worse. He’d get weaker, and unable to even move.    I hated seeing him unable to move. I hated seeing the strong man I knew, so weak. It was the beginning of August; we called my father and asked him to fly to Texas. My Grandpa had wanted to see my father the whole summer, but he just wasn’t able to make it down to Texas. My father flew in too late. My Grandpa died on August 8th, 2004 after midnight. My father arrived an hour later. It was horrible knowing that he was just a little too late. My Grandpa had open heart surgery years before this, so his heart was strong enough and made him live longer than he was supposed to. His funeral was days later and we miss him more than anything.   After his funeral, everyone was upset. Everyone was

For example I start twitching and my hands start playing with things, I doodle, etc. I try really hard to focus but then my mind wanders. I have a learning disability called auditory processing.      Here is the definition:      Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a learning disability in which an individual hears sounds but cannot process them correctly into words and language. People with CAPD may have trouble understanding what they hear, acting on it quickly, remembering it for a short or long time, and formulating a verbal response. Speech-language pathologists and audiologists are often involved in the diagnosis and treatment of auditory processing problems.      I think one of the things I have to do is get my seat changed. But even in the correct seating its difficult to pay attention. I may have A.D.D. XD      Anyways do you have any advice/tips on paying attention? Thanks

20090203121716AAKDxBJ	Education & Reference;Teaching	How do you teach someone to handle their money?	My fiance is terrible with money.  His mother did everything all wrong while he was growing up.  (details on that at the end).  We both lived with our parents when we met and just moved in together recently after getting engaged.  I knew his spending was bad but I had no idea!  He makes a lot less than I do and he spends way more.  I only ask him to pay the phone bill an groceries since the house is in my name and he has car insurance and his cell phone to worry about.  Half the time he can't even handle that!  He keeps coming about a penny away from overdrawing his account and he doesn't even care.  He always just expects things to work out (meaning he expects me to pay things or give him money if he runs out).  I told him before we moved in together that I couldn't afford to support us both and he said he understood but he won't stop spending.  He forgot to bring a change of clothes one day when he met me after work in town so he spent $55 on a new outfit after getting a million new things for christmas!  He spent over $150 on himself in the first half of january and now he can't afford groceries until his next paycheck.  He understand that he can't stay in the house if he doesn't help me but he doesn't understand how much his little gadgets and snacks actually cost.  He blames it on his income.  I've laid it all out and shown him what it all adds up to before and he still doesn't get it.  He just insists he can handle it then when I tell him we need groceries he suddenly can't afford it.  And when holidays come around he gets upset that he can't afford a gift for me.  I tell him all the time that he has no excuse and I'm not listening to his complaints because he wastes his money.  How can I get through to him?  I love him and want to marry him but I can't be the only adult in the relationship.      About the mother:   She spends money faster than she makes it and taught her kids the same.  Anything she can't afford goes on her credit card.  When he was 13 she made him get a job so that he could put a downpayment on a truck when he turned 16.  Every paycheck she took $80 for the truck fund and let him keep $20.  So the only money he saw from his paycheck was spending money.  If he needed to use that money for something else his mother just didn't give it to him and paid for whatever it was herself.  When he turned 16 and picked the truck he wanted (which he could have paid in full) she wouldn't let him get it because she thinks that only brand new vehicles are safe.  She picked out a much more expensive one and bought it herself using his money for the downpayment meaning he owed her for the rest.  Instead of letting him make monthly payments she would randomly come up to him demanding $500.  She also didn't let him have access to his bank account until he was 18 and wouldn't take her name off of it until he was 19.

20090220030128AAWFvdH	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What does this dream mean?	Last night i had a dream that i was going out with Ronan Keating from Boy-zone (god knows why) and i was doing a model shoot and my mum was the photographer. Then suddenly, we were all having a party in my friends house and Ronan proposed to me! (So weird) and then i was outside sitting in a chair and my dad came out with a gun, i shouted I Love You to Ronan just before my dad shot me in the head. I remember thinking that being shot in the head wouldn't hurt and that i was going to die instantly, but it turned out that he missed a certain part of my brain (not possible) and it didn't kill me, but i had to pretend that i was dead in case he shot me again. Then me and ronan and my friends were in Co Op hiding from my dad and buying scratch cards. And then i went back to my house and my mum had forgiven my dad for shooting me and allowed him back in the house, and i couldn't believe it. I cant remember the rest. Its really strange that my dad shot me though, because i am a 'daddy's girl' at heart. Id like to know what all of this means please! ha ha
