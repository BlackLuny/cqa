swBwNCUMaa	Since you're in an industry where your hair has the potential to receive a ton of damage (especially if they want to add color to it!), getting extensions, or better yet, a wig, would be a great idea!<br>  <br>  If you decide to go the hair extension route, consider this:  as long as your real hair is out to blend in with the extensions, it's still prone to damage.  Extensions are great for adding length, but make sure not to glue in extensions to the scalp, that will result in long term hair follicle damage.  Fusion tracks last a number of months, and can be washed and reused.<br>  <br>  To totally protect your real hair, you should hide it altogether!  Your best bet would be to go to a high end beauty supply store, or shop online, and purchase a human hair lace wig.  lace allows for an extremely natural looking hairline, so that it won't be obvious that you're wearing hair that's not your own.<br>  <br>  Upgrading to salon hair products will help the health of your hair as well.  Try to avoid using shampoos with sulfates (harsh detergents that strip the hair), and conditioners with mineral oil (a synthetic oil that blocks moisture from the hair).  Some great brands to use (that I use as well) are Pureology, Redken, Joico, and Wella.<br>  <br>  As a general rule of thumb, using heat more than twice a week can be extremely damaging.  Make sure your hairstylist uses a heat protectant first, if you must use heat more often than 2x a week.<br>  <br>  Also, be prepared to pay a bit extra for quality.  Cheap hair extensions and wigs don't last nearly as long as high quality ones, and salon products, though more expensive than drugstore brand shampoos and conditioners, are much more gentle on the hair.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|cLAx2WH6aa	um u r a walking clothes rack SO... u do what the company wants u to do not whats best 4 u BUT maybe buy some specialshampoos or somethin

DI3u9gMSaa	People won't be able to see your aligners if they are, say, five feet from you.  But your teeth show a different lighting, reflecting an artificial light.  <br>  <br>  If you have buttons put on, people will notice them because they stick out noticeably.  Check out my site and look at the picture of my co-worker wearing aligners on bottom.  She has bottoms on her top teeth.<br>  <br>  Price varies depending on location.  In the Bay Area, they are $6,000-$7,000.  In smaller areas, they may be a thousand to two cheaper without being of lesser quality.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Yes. You can see them and people will be able to tell you have them. They are kinda clear though.
HzjeKsDJaa	yes it sucks<br> <br> .

Also go onto craigslist.org enter your city and state and see if gowns are for sell for cheap or even free. Good luck in your search, hope you find something nice and cheap.|`|xGI9z01Maa	Not that I know of.  But check your local thrift shop or the one in the next town over.  I got a really great dress for $20.  I could not find one in my town that fit me correctly because of the new fashions are for girls that are thin thin and not top heavy.  And I am top heavy DDD and 140 lbs not 110.  My husband's friends all loved the dress.  It was for an over the top Christmas party and we were all in prom dress.  I also went back and bought a few others at $10 to $20 per dress and my daughter (8) and her friends love to dress up in them.  <br>  <br>  Note: most people only use the dress once.  Then it sits in their house until they finally give it to the good will.|`|zUXCCpJ1aa	they are so cheap you might a well buy one. go to the website and see what their policies are.

Dying too often will severely damage your hair and it will almost seems like your hair is losing length and not even growing!<br>  <br>  this is due to hair splitting and falling or getting pulled off. Yeah, it sucks. I had a friend who dyed his hair pretty often and straightened it daily, his hair got an inch shorter! lol|`|byd1bd0Haa	Milkshakes.<br>  <br>  vanilla, strawberry, chocolate.<br>  YUM.|`|pQ4GqIo6aa	well it does damage your hair making it break off more..so it will seem like your hairs growin slower<br>  <br>  sadly i know that from personal experience :/<br>  lol|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	no|`|xHCezKLuaa	ive been dying my hair black constently for a full year, and its been growing like crazy.

uzOkYOaAaa	1st picture is awesome...i really love ashlee simpsons hair color and i'm pretty sure it was very similar to that...to me ashlee simpson has the PERFECT shade of red hair. <br>  <br>  it suits you ah-mazing<3 definitely keep the red...maybe just brighter.|`|AA11914950	AUGH! No red! lol<br>  I prefer pretty much ANY color to red on a girl lol <br>  Black shouldn't look bad on you, maybe it was the wrong shade for you? did u try dark dark dark dark black? lol|`|5YMkieeXaa	i think a real POP type of red on myspace a few days ago i saw a girl with this gorgeous crazy unrealistic red color.<br>  <br>  so i think an unrealistic red would be best and you should str8 your hair with flicks to increase the POP.|`|ffuabklPaa	love the 1st one|`|YW74O9aNaa	i like the color in the last picture :) <br>  You haven't asked about it... but i think you need to let ur eyebrows grow and then shape them in a better way.. more natural looking.. the shape in the snaps is weird!|`|Deb4iqbvaa	I think with your great eyes and skin tone, you should go jet black! <br>  <br>  It would really make your eyes pop.|`|teNUDFtGaa	i like the color in the first pic|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	either black or chestnut brown nothing was wrong with the first pic jus looks dry is all
uzOkYOaAaa	your hairs perfect! if it bothers you instead of wearing gel try smoothing hairspray it tames it and it will stay while it still looks natural and not "gelly" even though its for girls it works really good for both I have friends that use it too. Its brand is GOT2B and its the smoothing hairspray.|`|DxKDfoFJaa	Emo dudes are hot! <br>  The jabbing of the eyelids is just something you'll get used to.<br>  It looks really really good just the way it is.<br>  Im afraid if you cut it, then it'll look too...well not as cool :)|`|r8rrwhc9aa	U LOOK HOT!!!!!!|`|BnPe68lmaa	swoshing ur hair to the side is hot..nd u do lukk soo much better without gel...u cud trim it|`|rzqZEVr8aa	part your hair in the center ?|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	u look fine keep it|`|Afd77Xekaa	gel your hairline, it should keep your hair in the direction you are trying to keep it. Like by your forhead and find a part to gel too.|`|R8v712Gvaa	I LOVE the way you did your hair in the 2nd pic.<br>  <br>  Um i would suggest using a straightner on your bangs! I use a straightner on my bangs cause they're frightning, and it helps soooo much!|`|PfgtUCRyaa	i really really like your hair without the gel. i don't think you should do anything to it! it looks really good. zac effron-ish. sort of.|`|fFOzNY6jaa	you could try using a straightener while your bangs are wet.<br>  If not i think it looks better without gel.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	yeah, looks better without gel.<br>  <br>  just cut them shorter but be sure to thin the edges so it doesn't look like you have girl bangs|`|ux4rkJKdaa	What worked for me was using a hair straightener to kinda part it away from my eyes. Or kinda curl it up...Either way works.|`|7RRg1MiWaa	Without Gel :) deff|`|F3ZF914baa	dont use gel and keep the bangs|`|E638ukebaa	get over yourself FFS|`|0e8388423ced2d02c017fafde4f15141aa	just cut it a little. theres nothing wrong with swooshing your hair every five seconds. haa|`|4gyOqTqGaa	kut your hair emo kid!|`|SuqYuobdaa	fk ur hair its ugly mines better|`|zktBKIYCaa	That happened to me too and it sucked cause it kept going at it, poking in my eyes. Gel's okay but it can cause dandruff and greasy hair. My best suggestian is getting a different bang haircut where it will naturally just slide towards the side of your face without irritating your eyes. It works - but if not, just straighten your bangs. When you do it, clip a fair amount of air at the flat iron and pull it towards the direction where you want the bang to slide to. Hold and slide down hair for a few seconds and release. Repeat with other strands of bangs.|`|cf6fd7a114fa1687119395d4a7148ffbaa	crop ur bangs a bit|`|9BW2ics3aa	thier right ur hair does look better withot gel but if u dont want it in ur eyes ur gonna have to trim it a lil just till its a lil above ur eye...just to let u kno i agree with thta one chick that ur HOT!!!|`|7Zkxl8Fuaa	cut it so that it goes to the side, but make it look roughishish.|`|FxVObTNxaa	straightener.<br>  <br>  p.s. ur pretty hot :]|`|zF4oaLnKaa	yu do look better without the gel<br>  yu sort of really dont look like an emo dude!|`|bATxGh9Oaa	I think your hair looks good without gel..|`|rruyenPBaa	without gel<br>  you look super sexy your hair look greasy with gel|`|qSy2FWe9aa	its cutee :) dont chage it yet. unles its like super longg.|`|vuPJipLeaa	But you look better without the gel!|`|Qa0s3HAeaa	Cut your bangs a little bit shorter! :D|`|NSKimt1Qaa	It looks good either way, but I especially like the second picture.  My sons wear their hair similar to that and they look good with that emo look, too.  If it irritates your eyes or eyelids, you could get it trimmed just enough so it doesn't, or just gel the hair by your eyes to keep it out.|`|VHi7Kaokaa	cut your bangs?|`|0S5qfrncaa	It looks better without gel haha,|`|StJGeiFyaa	grow your bangs out longer and they will fall naturally to the side more than they do now|`|BO28Mn8haa	just half an inch off the bangs should do the trick|`|qfe5GOcMaa	your the kid that asked if u can notice the scar, and what is up with the hello kitty?

Don't cut nothing.|`|zTeYsZAVaa	without gel looks better..just cut them.
fHgo950Zaa	no.<br>  theres a girl in my class who wears the earrings necklace and bracelet all together and i think it looks great!<br>  it really depends on your style and whatnot...<br>  if you like it, go for it.|`|QMYNU9uNaa	I would wear only one or two of them. I think all three would look a little tacky and be too matchy.|`|QZUxiZpNaa	Nah they're cute!!|`|uLelMuqZaa	I think it would be tacky, not because they're matchy-matchy, but because you're basically screaming "I CAN AFFORD TIFFANY & CO. AND I'M COOL BECAUSE OF IT!!!!!!!" on your jewelry. However, they are all very cute alone! :D|`|AA11908398	I think if you really wanted to you could wear all three of them together, but personally I would wear either the necklace or earrings with the ring.  Not all of them.|`|9d2db9730c45a5d0e6a829f7ac0a5a00aa	Perfectly honest?? a little <br>  i would say pick 2 out of the three to wear together and switch it up with other designers<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  Lollie|`|h31I5hSAaa	tacky! get pieces that complement each other, but arent exactly the same<br>  good luck!|`|TwXJS1thaa	I don't think it's tacky. It looks very nice together and is kind of "classy yet casual". I would definitely wear those together. Tacky is a bunch of plastic jewelry or like 10 bracelets on one arm. If you only wore one item, it would look okay but all together it is a set. It matches seemlessly so go ahead. :)|`|FpUPEJZyaa	i think the necklace and ring or the earrings and ring will go good together but not all three. but it depends what the occasion is. if its casual then either or of what i just said, but if its fancy then all three will be good.|`|CmiM40gPaa	the ring and one other thing would be fine,<br>  but don't wear the earrings and the necklace together, it is tacky, hate to break it to ya. Cute stuff though|`|kl4uqG0Laa	there all cute but wear them separately.<br>  i wore a Tiffany necklace once in the 7th grade and people started calling me Miss Tiffany & co. :)|`|jIeupHgJaa	Um, yeah. It's just too much. I think you should wear them seperately from each other.|`|9eb4f9ecc23dbc08ff09badb95268b49aa	wayy too much!! people are going to get the impression that your trying to show off all your tiffanys|`|XWxnqDDAaa	they are cute!!1|`|WtElgJDtaa	its okay. but try to mix them up|`|0KpHYUZBaa	I agree with what somebody else said..<br>  The jewelry itself is kind of tacky because its like<br>  "Oh hai, I can afford Tiffany & Co. so thats why its huge on my jewelry."<br>  <br>  But I think you should go with just wearing one at a time or just like everybody else said, just the necklace and ring or just the earrings and ring.|`|fC81Q0kTaa	If you love it - go for it!  It is about you being happy.  They are cute.  However, I think that since they are 'labeled' for Tiffany it would look like you are trying too hard.  Have you thought about choosing your one favorite from that line and looking for similar items without the label (or just coordinate the metal and simplicity)?|`|Xg9tvcOJaa	you should not wear that it is to matchy it is not nice but they look nice but not together but have you seen the price that is too muchyou could get cheaper in those 25 cents and there nice but plastick or metal and way cheaper <br>  <br>  p.s ........<br>  <br>  <br>  bad mixture really|`|9jiHVKpOaa	those are all really cute!!! it may be a little much but i bet you could pull it off!! you could always wear the ring but maybe not the earrings and necklace at the same time.. but like i said you can probally pull it off!!|`|F3ZF914baa	it would look fine but you should wear your hair down to make it look less obvious and like not look like ur tryin to show it off other wise i think it wood look fine|`|ydd1EFTsaa	Mix it up - otherwise it'll look like you're trying too hard. Matchy-matchy is "not in."|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	Go for it. I love tiffany...... all the pieces you picked out match and would look great together........ enjoy !|`|XfyqdwCdaa	no!!! its totally fashionable=)|`|2O8Jqwb6aa	It's a little much.  It'd look best with just one.|`|XkkADjL0aa	kinda srry

I've seen bridesmaids wear black...<br>  <br>  Wear something you are comfortable in,. just do not upstage the bride... <br>  <br>  If you wear a silver top, wear black skirt with silver shoes... and jewelry, you'll look put together and the black skirt will not be an issue.|`|Az9keOz5aa	NEVER wear juts plain black to a wedding,and try gold,pink,white,black with the silver top.=] Maybe even blue.|`|DE1pTaBFaa	as long as if it is a cocktail dress|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	Little black dresses are a must have and great to wear anywhere anytime........

JTjL9eD7aa	I have once and everything was fine.  The products were great and I certainly got my money's worth.  I just ordered again, however, about a month ago, and although they have my money, I have not heard from them about my order at all.  I have been trying to contact them for weeks now and have heard nothing, so I'm not even sure what to do.  If you do order, let me know what happens!  They were reliable before... I'm not sure what's going on now!
XUYayi27aa	I've had my belly ring for about 5 years. All my friends take my advice for it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your doing a fine job, you can use sea salt. But i would recommendd using the spray bactine. It's the most sterilel way of cleaning your belly ring, because after you spray it on, you can move your belly ring up and down and making sure the solution gets in. It heals faster this way.|`|ivRoNozyaa	OMG, they told you to use salt water?  How very hippie.  I'd only do that by going in the ocean (but then, I am in Hawaii).  I was told to use Hibacleanse (spelling?) that they use in hospitals - I did - and my belly got nasty and infected.  I'd use Bactine if I were you.  Go with the salt in a couple of weeks.  (But yes, Q0tip around piercing; don't dump the cup.)|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	I've never heard of putting Sea Salt on it. You should just take warm water and a Q Tip and clean around it getting the icky stuff off of it. The only reason I think it's weird is because salt in a would can hurt. I guess if that's what he said to use though....use it. But don't even worry about the right amount of liquids to use.....so long as you use warm water and go around the outside of the piercing holes....you'll be fine I promise....no worries!<br>  Hope this helped!|`|TnQEOdX0aa	You can buy wound wash saline solution from most drug stores. <br>  You clean it withthe saline on a Q-Tip and then soak it with the saline in the Dixie Cup.<br>  It's easier to just buy saline because you don't have to worry about dissolving the right amount of salt in the water or anything.<br>  The saline doesn't hurt or sting the piercing at all. Neither will sea salt.
AA11901859	The ties are the only part that looks a little weird with it.  The jackets work bc they have black detailing on them
sgQDnCfvaa	holes on your knees should be fine, jeans with holes up in the crotch on the other hand... you probably shouldn't wear them to school. My favorite pair of school jeans have a huge whole on the knee :p<br>  <br>  Well hope this helps!|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Yeah avoid holes in the crotch or *** area, you don't want to look like some stripper with the *** cut out of the leather pants.<br>  <br>  If its just holes in the knees and they are too big that should be fine. Although it all depends on your schools uniform code and how posh the school is, Im surprised you don't have to wear a uniform and can opt to wear jeans.|`|xGd5wTfGaa	some schools do have a dress code policy on ripped jeans but i dont think theyre that strict about it, my school uses uniforms and they dont mind so go for it
fSOZqZ0Taa	if your hairs pretty long, put it in like 4 or more braids for 2 or days (but you can still wash it, even though its kinda hard). on the 4th day, take out the braids and it looks really frizzy and cute|`|vjVEgISnaa	the easiest way to do it is with a large curling iron...and wrap your hair around the outside of it...dont clip your hair in that clip thing...but if you dont wanna use the curling iron...try regular curlers...they might work...|`|ORupWJg3aa	braid your hair right after u get outta the shower and sleep in them and take them out wen dry or wait til your hair is semi dry then braid to get waves faster. smaller the braid the wavier your hair will be

I would NOT suggest teasing it. <br>  Hot curlers are supposed to be really good at ridding frizz and curling, you may want to try that :)|`|xHCezKLuaa	alrighty well for one, i suggest a creme you put on when your hair is wet that makes it silky and smooth. You can find them anywhere and it really doesnt matter what type you use.<br>  <br>  Alot of people think they dont have wavy hair but trust me! everone can have wavy hair!!! you just have to have the right tools!! like a diffuser and this stuff..........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+Sty1_13//|diagnostic:_blank|main:brandpage:studioline|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  <br>  it makes you hair hold curls and very shiny,<br>  <br>  steps to make mavy hair.....<br>  <br>  wash hair, and put in a towel WITHOUT BRUSHING IT! you lose some of its natural curl when you brush it!! wait about five/eight minuets and towel dry to get rid of extra wetness, then part(NOT STARIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE! you arent alf alfa!) and spray the curl bossting spary all over, then use the diffuser attchment and dry,<br>  <br>  it looks great i promise! i usto have hair just like that, and if you dont have bangs you can try spicing it up by poofing up the hair right over  the forhead and pulling it back in a clip.<br>  <br>  and sweatheart, if you have a good starightener, it shoudnt take you more then ten mins.....depends on how you staighten it!!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!

The third one is BEAUTIFUL but you would disappear in it. The second os PERFECT for you|`|eisKFHM7aa	Second Or Third.<br>  <br>  I prefer the third one.

So definitely the second or third.|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	First one is gorgeous. <br>  You won't go wrong with any of them though :)|`|OmvZDZaWaa	Definitely not the third, it would overwhelm you.

I do wear skinny jeans actually(even colored skinny jeans), even in the summer, but I mostly wear shorts and skirts during the summer, cuz it gets prettty hot where I live! <br>  <br>  I shop at places like PacSun, Charlotte Rousse, Forever 21, Wet Seal, Abercrombie(and Fitch) Hollister, I also love to wear Don Ed Hardy designs! <br>  <br>  but yeah, there's lots more of places I like to shop, but it's too long to list.|`|bBJXp9oFaa	Comfy, but trendy.<br>  I like skinnies or straight legged jeans, and longish shirts.<br>  I like vneck shirts too, I like the indie style I guess if you want to label it.<br>  <br>  I used to be really emo/scene.

I also like to wear converse, and colored skinny jeans..right now i own "seafoam green, red, navy blue, yellow, purple, dark green, and orange." I liek to wear a lot of roxy, and volcom jackets.. my style is really crazy. you never know what your going to get..a preppy sweater and a skirt, or a mismatched jumble of colors.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I dunno :/ <a href="http://ilikemystyle.net/user/sewermetro" rel="nofollow">http://ilikemystyle.net/user/sewermetro</a><br>  I have a theme half the time... like 60s vacation in Hawaii..or today I was sort of a kindergarten teacher with a long plaid dress over a pinstripe shirt and a red granny sweater.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I wear mostly casual clothing because I don't work.

Hmm... typically cotton and denim.<br>  <br>  As for what the type of clothes that I wear.... typically whatever's cheap and comfortable. Unless it has some personal significance (like a souvenir t-shirt) I never want letters printed on my clothes. People who wear giant words across their chest like FITCH are real sell-outs in my book - they're just the company's advertising "fitches," if you know what I mean...<br>  <br>  Instead of brand names, I look for sturdy pants, brightly colored t-shirts and eye-catching patterns on collared shirts.|`|HBFHZXybaa	Comfortable clothes. When I am at home (which is sadly most of the time) I wear sweats around the house (they are SOOO COMFY!). When I go out, I usually wear a sweatshirt and jeans, or a nice long sleeved shirt, jeans, belt. Im really just a t-shirt and jeans girl, im not a girly girl.

31NapKplaa	they are called Morticians<br>  and you probably just have to go to beauty school!|`|sCnksozaaa	what a question, maybe a mortician or someone like that.   im just guessing lol|`|6Z49DZaRaa	This type of work is usually done by an embalmer, or sometimes a mortician who doubles as an embalmer. It would be rare to find a job doing only makeup; embalmers are also responsible for the actual preservation of the body as well as other grooming.<br>  <br>  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming#Grooming)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming#G...</a><br>  <br>  As far as school goes, it really depends on where you live. Some regions require certification, and some don't. It would probably be a good idea to train and get licensed/certified in this field to make sure you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Check out your local community colleges. They might have training programs, but otherwise it might be hard to find since it's such an uncommon career path. Best of luck!|`|VKYkyx4Daa	Depending on the morgue, the people that do makeup can also be the ones who do the embalming. I won't go into great detail about what they do during embalming, but it's pretty nasty. I'm not sure if this is always the case though.|`|554cbaad408d4cd105322cde412038daaa	Either the Mortician does it or they hire a makeup artist sometimes if they want a quality job done.|`|Afd77Xekaa	Mortician|`|p3uxmB14aa	They're Mortician Beauticians!

7f21c7e291997b848d2e257c08fe42a6aa	hey girl, <br>  Your probably gorgeous without make up, but i totally know where your coming from when you say you want to wear it. The best thing to do is just be like dad i really would like to start wearing make up i know im your little girl, but im growing up. Even just ask him if he would let you wear some eye shadow or something just to start out with. Give it time and he will soon let you get by with more. Whatever you do dont get to happy with it lol its hard not to when your first starting out its exciting. (: But just try that and see. im sure it will work (: hope i helped!|`|PPwsaeUxaa	You could try being sensitive about it and cuddling up to him and explaining that it means a lot to you. Play the "I love you, you love me" card. You know, Barney style but less lame, more sappy.<br>  <br>  But then, do you want makeup to change your skin tone? or is it to cover up blemishes? I doubt that you need makeup. Do you know what it does to your skin? It ain't healthy, babe. My wife wears makeup but i'd rather she didn't. I count my lucky stars that she only wears eyeliner. <br>  <br>  Why do you need to cover up your natural skin? Olivish is a great tone. Pasty is.... well.... pasty! Yuck! Go au natural, sweety. Don't try to lighten your skin! Trust me! <br>  <br>  Do you know how many people would die to have a light olivish tone?|`|OuFI4ZxKaa	What you do is not tell him about it at all. If he gives you some money tell him your buying one thing but really just go buy make up. Dont go for the expensive stuff until later. When he begins to notice your wearing make up and you havent discussed it with him it'll me like a silent hint that your growing up and your ready to start looking more grown and feminine. He should be able to understand. And if he shoots you down the first time just continue to wear it until he slowly accepts the idea. Oh and hide the make up until he does accept the idea. That's how I went through it with my dad.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	Maybe try getting your own job to show him how responsible you can be.  And say you want to try just very little and see how it looks.  And it's a girl's thing, just for fun|`|hHxJ0BONaa	tell him you are growing up and you would like to get some girl stuff at the store. just ask him. im sure he doesn't mean to be a cheap skate this economy is hard on everyone. :/|`|Ao0G4EUqaa	Act depressed that you have no mother to teach you these things and ask him if he knows anything... then he'll feel awkward and buy you some :) sorry bout your mom|`|wX46Gv4naa	I suggest not even wearing makeup, I don't and I'm a beaut! So sorry about your mother though.|`|3d6d798df3efc3fbc6eccc6d6f1eea40aa	you should just ask him, i know you are worried about certain situatons in life but take it slow in asking him but i would say sooner or later it has to happen, and just show him that you still love him and hes ur dad regardless, these moments are gonna happen, just let him know that even though things like this happens you dont think that you are any less worse off now and realize all the great things you still have and that you support him as long as hes doing what is best and what makes im happy<br>  <br>  now about the money thing, ask if you can do chores for an allowance, that way it can get you started in the working field of how to do hard work, what parent would give that up, also if he doesnt wanna pay you ask him if you can do chores that normally he would pay others to do, for example washing the car, or walking the dog if you guys have a pet, learning about computers so he doesnt have to fix it and pay others, idk hehe i really dont know what to do but ask him for an allowance for chores thats my best answer, <br>  <br>  elf products are really cheap, they are basically $1 for everything, but if you dont have a place that sells it than you have to order it online which stinks because they usually charge 6 dollars for shipping but sign up for email alerts because sometimes they have free shipping deals from time to time, sometimes they have sales and discounts, but other than that i heard target sells elf products sometimes, i get them from my local pharmacy so you can check and see if your local pharmacy has them or not, i dont remember their website but just google in "eyes lips and face cosmetics" thats what elf stands for and you should be directed to their site|`|16abellKaa	My parents split up before I could use makeup, and I lived most of the time with my dad. He didn't like the idea of me using makeup, thinking that I had "natural beauty." I went ahead and asked him if I could go for my 13th birthday to the clinique counter in the mall, telling him i wanted to get some advice on how i could take care of my skin. I had a lady do very natural makeup on my face, and when my dad came to pick me up, he couldn't tell I was wearing makeup. This is because it wasn't heavy, but I definitely noticed the makeup. The counter requires you to buy $20 worth of products with the free makeover, and when the lady explained to my dad that I was wearing makeup, he realized I was growing up and agreed to buy me some makeup, if and only if I promised to keep it natural the way the lady did. I recommend trying the same thing.|`|TuBzc1R5aa	you said you were in your teens, so get a job. I'm 15 and have a job and love how I get to be independent and buy things that I need/want by myself. But just say, "Hey Dad, would it be alright with you if I start wearing makeup and buy it myself?"<br>  <br>  p.s. sorry about your loss.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Your question is all over the place. I have no clue what your actually asking. I am however sorry about the loss of your mother.|`|Zjq1yzEqaa	Just play the pity card, say you dont have a mom to talk you to and get past this so you need to find out for yourself.|`|dat8eoYyaa	i would just ask someone else, they will understand your situation. your step mom, a friend, or 1 of your friends moms|`|ks1kqQ7paa	Get a job and make the money yourself. >_>|`|1vaqtRI2aa	I'm sorry for your situation.<br>  <br>  Since you can't get a job, how about babysitting or doing odd jobs for money? Selling old clothes on ebay or Platos closet?<br>  I know parents want to see you're responsible before you start wearing make-up, and a huge thing about being responsible is someone making money for yourself. So even small things you can do to get some. <br>  <br>  Start out with little things like an eyeshadow here and there. If he is bothered by it, he will say something and you can stop.<br>  <br>  You said you want enhancers- a huge enhancer is an eyelash curler. The best ones I've ever got were the cheap-o $1 ones, buy one of those. And a nice enhancer for your cheek is one by Bonne Bell (don't know if you have that company) and it's a pink highlighter- they're about $1.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

fxwKFJefaa	i would go the sunglasses because if you get prescription lens in them and a style that suits you they will be priceless trust me! a good pair of sunglasses is essential. in your situation its wise to spend more on them as you dont want to be putting expensive lens in cheap glasses.<br>  <br>  i dont believe in spending alot on bags because its better to buy a few different ones to go with different outfits than one expensive one that you'll get sick of. trends change too much to justify spending that much on a bag.|`|YpH6yMpsaa	I prefer the sunglasses <br>  these will make you safer on the road (lol)<br>  i don't think you should by that bag and big bags are in Fashion|`|3oEkpDNQaa	get the bag :D|`|03IrlOjVaa	the shades are hot. the bag...i dont like the color. but you dont want cheap sunglasses cause they can damage your eyes. you want quality shades. the wrislet you can always opt for a cheaper one :)|`|dat8eoYyaa	well i dont know how it works w/handbags but u can ask...i got my coach bag @ nord. and fendi sunglasses there too...the logo fell off my glasses and they replaced them w/ gucci ones, idk about handbags, but @ least if something happens 2 your glasses u can get a new pair|`|ZPsLuAncaa	i would buy the shades everybody needs a good pair of stunna shades ( i have pair of prada ones i love) <br>  <br>  besides i don't really like the bag the new coach Cs suck don't buy that|`|733yHonMaa	i like the wristlet more. if you buy the sunglasses & you drop them or sit on them... then you wasted all that money. plus, i find that sunglasses from even target get me compliments. go for the wristlet-- it's cute!|`|mU6Owbhoaa	your right, buying name brands is pointless, you could basically be spending hundreds of dollars for the 'coach' label which is about the size of a coin.<br>  <br>  It quality that matters, and just because it is not the most expensive doesn't mean that it is the better product.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you get the bag, like you said you don't usually wear sunglasses but you will always use a bag, and shop around until the right bag for you, and it is good quality.<br>  <br>  As silly as it sounds maybe you should wear a hat or a visor when driving your car, it is very dangerous to be driving with the sun glaring in your eyes. Or you could find another driving route that is less sunny.
zlXofrG4aa	Yes.  Your body's oils and cheap metal don't mix well.  It'll react with the metal and cause it to turn your skin green.  I've had necklaces as well as rings that have done that.|`|cAMdBtFQaa	Jewelry is generally made of alloys of various metals.  Sterling silver is mixture of some metal and pure silver.  Gold is also alloyed with various metals and it is called 14 kt gold, 10 kt gold, 24 kt gold is pure gold.<br>  The typical mixture uses copper.  Copper will turn your skin green in lower karat alloys and as a pure metal.  Sterling, generally will turn you black if you react to it.|`|TR9lcgcjaa	If it's fake it will do that but if its real and discolors your skin, you could be allergic to the gold or silver.  If you wear foundation on your neck gold will turn it black.  take a gold ring and run it across your face while you are wearing foundation make-up.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	if its cheap and in contact with your body oils, yes<br>  some of the times its the copper alloy|`|1yov0JF9aa	cheap metals oxidize and discolor the skin. Brass and copper turn green, silver turns black. Gold does not oxidize.

pqlhPnexaa	Wow. You are STUNNING (i'm sure you hear that all the time, but just incase you're feeling insecure or whatever :-))<br>  <br>  I really like you hair as it is in the first picture, actually. Your eyes are dark, and I think having the dark hair really makes them pop (and your hair color just generally makes your features look good). I'd vote for keeping it as it is.|`|cwEO2tGtaa	your hair style in pic two is really pretty and looks good on you also the last pic with a red  tone is pretty thats what i would stick to|`|OfQ5zq1Maa	Love the red hair!!

Your hair looks fine as is.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|d16vMconaa	I think you look good as is.  In my opinion the reddish hair color in the third pic looks nice but as you are is very nice.  I also agree that you look good in the second pic for special occasions, but as a guy I agree that it can give the appearance of feeling insecure/lots of work.|`|NV6aqf0Naa	Oh my goodness! I love the 2nd one. It really flatters your face shape. You look stunning :D|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Keep your style, it's your identity. And your hair colour looks the prettiest in the first pick. Also, you're makeup is lovely, not too much or too little x
xU3uBy4Saa	Honestly, the only people that I know that have tragus piercings are girls.  I personally have them pierced on both ears because I thought just one looks awkward.  A few of my friends only have one though, and it still looks cute.  The pain is there, ohhhh yeah.  But it isn't excruciating. To me, if hurt more during the healing process than the actual piercing part.  The jewelry that I have are little studs, so it really looks feminine and cute.|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Yeah, they do on cute, girly girls. Because the piecing doesn't make them look butch. Two ears probably wouldn't be the best idea appearance wise, one is cute though x|`|mU6Owbhoaa	personally i think they look trashy, on anyone.|`|q8m8wSTYaa	I personally love tragus piercings, probably because I have one but that's besides the point.(= When I got mine done I didn't feel it at all except for a little pinch when the needle went through. I don't like how it looks when both tragus' are pierced, to be honest. It heals pretty quickly. But you can't use earbud headphones until it heals, or if you have an eyebrow ring in it. I personally like the labret jewelry to put in my tragus cos it doesn't get in the way.<br>  Hope this helped.(=|`|JfOuzOJGaa	I think mine looks good on me.  I don't really classify any piercing as looking good strictly on one type of person.  Different piercings look good on different people.  If you like the way it looks and want to give it a shot, then do it.  If you don't like it, then you can always remove it.<br>  <br>  And pain is relative.  It didn't hurt me at all, but I've heard other people say it hurt them pretty badly.|`|5urq0LDyaa	its all a matter of personal opinion. draw a dot on the spot you want pierced. then look at it from different angles. see what you think of it.  there's always gonna be people that dont like it, ignore them. ive heard it hurts a bit, but mostly that it just feels weird lol. besides one thing ive learnt from piercings is that the initial piercing is never as bad as you think. its fairly thick cartilage so it will probably hurt, but only for a second, not enough to matter. then it will probably feel kinda hot and maybe a throbbing feeling. but that should be it. <br>  <br>  all i can say is if you want it, get it. if you dont like it you can always take it out. <br>  <br>  good luck, and if you get it, i hope it turns out great =]|`|j5F2wOapaa	okay well i got mine done :)  and it doesnt hurt at all. to me the scariest part of a piercing is the sound of the  piercing gun and since there isnt one i didnt even feel it. <br>  <br>  but depending on your style i guess u can say is if it looks good or not! i think it looks better on a more gurly gurl so that it doesnt look  manish!! but i dont like the look of both sides done i think it looks like too much. <br>  <br>  so i got it on one side and got the rook done on the other side. <br>  <br>  i hope this helps u|`|YXm0C5ujaa	i think they look pretty on girls i dont have them done but i have realized that one just makes u look incomplete if u get ur tragus pierced go for both sides and for the pain level it just matters on the person and their tolerance for needles and pain =] hope i help|`|FbJ8ruAFaa	I don't know that I've seen a guy with it done. It a notorious piercing for getting swollen and infected badly! Never seen anyone with both sides done either, try holding studs or rings up to them and see what you like best I guess. Good luck!|`|cK07UqtDaa	If you like how it looks then get one aslong as it's in a clean reputable studio and if you're underage you have parental permission. It will hurt,all piercings do to some extent.|`|7gj6ymwhaa	Get it on only one ear if you do. I think that they look cute. I've heard it's pretty painful though
p7Zz8rKyaa	I would put it under your moisturizer so that it is in direct contact. If you can, go without a moisturizer or just apply it in just your dry areas. That way your skin will air out and the pimple can dry out.|`|PxCMYmrwaa	u dont use moisterizer when u use pimple cream<br>  also pimple creams are rip-offs, cause they dont work...ur pimple goes away in the same time as u use or dont use pimple creams<br>  Toothpaste or actually pro-active are the only 2 things dat actually work<br>  hope this helped!|`|TTsVhHq4aa	over =)|`|Jfn5nkHUaa	deff over.|`|3sM4PS3yaa	over, thats what i do

08zR9MJOaa	I don't know if you are or not, but I am allergic to nickel which is in most metals.  If you do get your belly pierced, most jewelry is allergin free so it shouldn't.  <br>  <br>  The best metal to deal with in this case is Sterling Silver.|`|gh2FdQ7waa	titanium<br>  @ hot topic<br>  make sure its not heavy|`|FbJ8ruAFaa	I have the same problem, but I have my bridge pierced, not my belly.

Worst comes to worse, you'll have to wear the stud for a few weeks and deal with the itching, and once it heals, get yourself a good one :)|`|cK07UqtDaa	Titanium (implant grade) should be ok,a good piercing studio will be able to help you out.
154dzJ1Faa	You are right that water works -- for a time.  The reason why static shows up in hair is because the hair is too dry.  What you need is more water IN the hair.  It has become overly dry through use of shampoo, or surrounding air conditions.  You can spray it with water, and that only lasts until the surface of the hair dries again.  But you need to get water into the hair shaft, and keep it there.<br>  <br>  Often, we can put a coating of anything on the hair to keep it under control.  This can be sugars or oils, both of which will prevent surface static from forming.<br>  <br>  The first thing is to use a milder shampoo.  Whatever is used is doing too good a job at cleaning everything off the hair.  Perhaps you are using it too often.  Static is usually not a problem a day or two after the shampoo.  Try using a good conditioner or after-rinse.  Some styling aids will help as well.  Even a tiny drop of oil or cream worked into your hands, and then lightly run through her hair will give you some control.|`|SbvKHT64aa	Here is a great article with strategies for reducing static in hair:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4821017_stop-static-cling-hair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4821017_stop-sta...</a>
lCXlWhveaa	some people go to a 2 or higher for just getting them done, you can do it but it my hurt more than just a regular size. and at that small of a size you dont really have any threat of a tear if you go bigger tears happen so yes it is possible|`|TjPwxbuJaa	A size 14 is a standard piercing size in a body piercing shop. It is the only safe why to be pierced. The piercing guns are not as sanitary. 14g is hardly "gauged"; it was my starting size.

There are a couple different times that "pre-wrap" is used in connection to hair, and that means specific things.  There are also other body treatments that use "pre-wrap" as well.  Without knowing the full extent of what you are doing is really impossible to give you a full meaning of what it means.  At the very basic level, it is something done before the wrap.|`|JReroESmaa	the spanish word for prewrap is venda  :)

Light purple and light yellow look fine together, but NOT dark purple and light yellow. I would recommend a neutral shade for your eyes, such as light to medium shade of brown. You'd have to match the shade of brown with whatever skin tone you have, though. And maybe you could find a shadow with a little bit of sparkle in it, not too much though!!|`|wBHO3Zl7aa	I've always use purple eye shadow too that's my fave color and when Im not wearing something purple I just add some gold eye shadow and it looks very pretty you should try that...use your purple shadow and add a little bit of gold shadow .|`|vOB3iVdxaa	Supporting the LA Lakers ?

qdXGueBeaa	well if your not picky about where you want to work, go to the websites of all supermarkets, fast food places and other stores near you, and submit an application on the careers page. You can also look at www.seek.com.au. I got my job by putting an aplication on the store website.<br>  <br>  As for cheap clothes, look and see if theres a DFO (direct factory outlet) near you. They have all the same stores like in the regular shopping centres, but the stuff is all the slightly older and extra stock and is way cheaper that in the normal stores. Plus at the DFO the stuff is brand new, not like at lifeline and those scabby stores. So go to www.dfo.com.au and check the map to see if there is one near you, hopefully there will be because the dfo rocks!

NVuvP8kIaa	I have this exact same hair type and here's what I do.<br>  Use a sodium luareth sulfate free shampoo (such as Burt's Bees shampoo) sodium luareth sulfate is a detergent and dries out the hair making it frizzy. I switched from a Pantene shampoo to Burt's Bees and I noticed an immediate difference. <br>  Side note if you use Burt's Bees the mix is a bit watery b/c it does not contain sodium laureth sulfate so use a small amount and brush it throu your hair, it won't lather but it does just as good a job at cleaning your hair <br>  Then use an organic conditioner, conditioners have harmful chemicals in them as well, I use Organics Shea Butter formula.<br>  After you've washed and conditioned your hair you squeeze out a quarter size dollop of conditioner from the bottle. Run it through your damp hair using more at the ends.<br>  Finally spray your hair with a curl defining gel such as Garnier Fructis curl shaping spray gel.<br>  You can then either scrunch your hair for more volume or let it dry naturally and the result is defined, shiny, and smooth curls<br>  All these products are available at a grocery or drug store and should not cost more than 15 dollars all together.|`|RsqEi2Woaa	I think that you need a texturizer. Heres some info on it:<br>  <br>  What is a hair texturizer? It's basically a mild relaxer that loosens the natural curl pattern of the hair and produces easier manageability.<br>  <br>  What's different from a texturizer and a relaxer is the texturizer (or mild relaxer) is left on the hair for a very short time. It is not combed throughout the hair to avoid the hair from becoming straight.<br>  <br>  Treatments come in lye and no-lye formulas. For best results, use on naturally unprocessed curly hair. Once you get it done, you will be able to see what changes you’d like to make on different areas of your hair. Your stylist should be able to assist you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Many women who have very tightly curled hair have begun to look for ways to loosen their curls to give them better manageability and versatility. Although tight curls are very versatile, many women feel the need to opt for a change. You know the saying: "you always want what you don't have". Most people are never satisfied, which is alright. Just make the changes necessary for you to feel happy. Whether you are bored with your hair color and want to add a splash of color or you want to curl or straighten your hair, the choice is up to you.<br>  <br>  The same goes for hair texturizers. Some feel it's not natural because it's chemically altering the hairs natural state. However, it's up to the individual to make that decision. Whether it be for better manageability or for added glamour, the choice is yours. You have to manage your hair and you have to be happy with your hair and do what feels best for you.<br>  <br>  Today many women with curls - whether tight or medium curls, are looking for different styling options for their hair. Many women who have chemically straightened their hair in the past have decided that they wanted to go back to their curls. Many have never seen their natural curls since childhood and never knew what to expect. Once they stopped chemically straightening their hair and their natural curls grew in, they may have spent months or maybe even years getting to know their natural curls – how to manage them, and what products worked best on their hair type and texture.<br>  <br>  For those who were not satisfied or for those wanting something different they have opted for a hair texturizer.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.curlyhairsalon.com/texturizer..." rel="nofollow">http://www.curlyhairsalon.com/texturizer...</a>|`|Gx78CdS5aa	depending on the condition of your hair, a chemical relaxer might be an option, consult a stylist and they maybe able to do it without a lot of damage.  otherwise the curl control line from Aveda is a great line for curly hair to reduce frizz.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	get a straight perm.  If you get it done at a professional salon, your hair will be fine.  Besides, it's going to grow out eventually
Q3lazu6Uaa	side bangs are really easy to style. if you flat iron your hair, bring your sidebangs to the opposite side they're meant to be on, then curl them under.<br>  <br>  If not, use a blowdryer and a round brush, and style them that way.
DZkkYK0Baa	It's different for everyone. I've heard of people bleaching their hair three times in one day, though that's not recommended! Depending on the state of your hair already, it may or may not be so damaged that it falls out. Ask yourself if it's worth the risk to damage your hair again to get the results you want. I suppose there is a possibility that you could lose a ton of hair, perhaps even go bald. Is it worth it to have it the colors you want now? Personally, I would say not. I'm kind of a chicken. I'd back out and just dye it all one color or something. Maybe have a professional do it, though that can be pretty costly. <br>  <br>  If you're really wanting to bleach and dye again, wait a few days so your hair can rest. Walking around and having people see it like that probably isn't as bad as what could happen if you severely damage your hair. It might not even look that bad. Perhaps others will say it looks good. You never know! When I thought my hair looked terrible, I've had people say it looked good. Anyway, if you choose to bleach/dye again, wait and pamper your hair, before and after. Do hot oil treatments and use very good conditioner (protein conditioner - I've heard that Ion makes good products). Try to shampoo your hair as little as you can. Avoid heat styling products (and, if you INSIST on using them, use heat protection spray). If you're bleaching dark hair, you may need to bleach twice and/or use a toner. Less is more with bleach. If you can, use a lighter volume the second time, if a second bleaching is needed. <br>  <br>  If you're not wanting to do that, I'd just dye it all black and try again after your hair has recovered (I'd wait at least one month - and that's with pampering). <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|dbp4jlBgaa	it might!|`|uYJdvnqxaa	You shouldn't bleach it again.It's bad for your hair.<br>  <br>  I say go to your hair stylist and ask for advice.|`|NVuvP8kIaa	If you continue to dye and bleach your hair it's going to end up completely fried. Lay off it a bit unless you want your hair to either fall out or take the same texture as straw. When I was younger I died and bleached only 2 times and my hair frizzed out. After three years it grew out into my natural dark brown and then I added highlights and that's all I have done to it since it regrew. Wait until your hair is healthy again until you bleach it.

Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  I know it doesn't matter but I thought it was kind of cute. :-)|`|sOkTUYq7aa	love it<br>  it's a medium.. like a bit bigger than those 'normal' canvas totes|`|mU6Owbhoaa	it looks big,<br>  <br>  what is so good about these bags?<br>  they are so ugly, what a complete waste of money
JfOuzOJGaa	It's spelled gauges.  And you want plugs.  Gauge is the size measurement, plug is the jewelry that goes in the ear.  If you stretch your ears you can still put regular earrings in your ear, but like someone else said, at a certain point the holes won't shrink all the way down to their original size.  There is no exact size that is the point of no return though.  Generally it ranges from 2g-00g, but any stretching should be viewed as a permanent modification.  It's definitely not a process for the impatient or fickle.|`|Z0Gr5ongaa	i don't think so|`|FbJ8ruAFaa	Depends how high you go, I have mine on a lower scale, so if I had to, I could put regular ones in. Just remember, once you get up to Zero on the gages, your ear won't naturally go back, you'll have to get surgery! Gaging isn't all it's cracked up to be really, some of the rings they have look cool.. but your ears usually smell pretty bad, so you won't really want anyone touching them to look at them. Just a few tips :)|`|5urq0LDyaa	you can always put dangly ones in. after you go so big though it starts to look gross lol. i noticed when i started stretching my ears that when i took out my earrings the holes shrunk, they were still stretched and fine, they just kinda shrunk. that was at an 8 gauge. i could totally have worn regular earrings at that size. what im doing is im stretching my ears to a 4 gauge. and when i get there im getting some eyelet plugs [plugs with the hole through the center] and im putting the earrings in those holes lol. not sure how well that would work for regular post earrings, but hoops and dangly's for sure would work. good luck. hope they look great =] i love mine =]|`|ejosT3OVaa	I had my ears gaged to I think it was a 14 and I wore regualar earrings in them all the time I would switch out. I didnt have a problem with it either. now if you have like big huge ones then it would probably just look weird lol.|`|LoKgkiuFaa	yeahhh<br>  once theyre gaged the holes will be too big for any regular earings|`|1lqflRPEaa	technically, u can put 'regular' earrings (normally 18-16g) in any size hole. although if u put those in a one inch hole, that is going to look absolutely ridiculous (mainly because it is just going to be hanging on).<br>  <br>  And usually the largest you can go stretch your ears to is 00Gauge, which is 10mm. Although, depending on how long you have had them, anywhere up to a 14mm hole will shrink back.<br>  <br>  But the whole point of gauging your ears is to put plugs in, not 'regular' earrings. ;)|`|yKN1bpSJaa	It all depends on how big you stretch, usually a 2G-00 your ears won't shrink. Smaller sizes would allow for your lobes to shrink and thus you will be able to wear regular earrings.
GZKbvXLLaa	Sorry folks, but you are incorrect. Nail polish remover will ruin the polish. This polish is way too old to be restored. Time to chuck the bottles and buy new ones. Polish remover never works. It dulls the shine, and wrecks the polish. It MAY work to thin the polish, but after you use it, you'll wish you hadn't.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	as everyone else said a small amount of nail polish remover should do the trick :D|`|eX8i4vwRaa	yeah; just pour a smidge of nail polish remover in there :)<br>  works!|`|ksZfTHyQaa	Nail Polish remover can work, but only temporarily. If you use it a  couple of times it will actually end up ruining your polish. I know you asked for something that you won't have to buy but if you want to make your polish last you really are better off buying something to restore them. You can use Seche Restore, which is a nail polish thinner that you can find at some beauty supply stores or online here: <a href="http://head2toebeauty.com/nail_glue_thinner/ngt.htm." rel="nofollow">http://head2toebeauty.com/nail_glue_thin...</a> <br>  <br>  It costs about the same as some nail polishes and it will restore them so they're back to their original consistency and shine. I personally think it's worth the purchase because your nail polishes will have a longer life as opposed to the nail polish remover method. The nail polish remover will end up ruining your nail polishes so you'll have to purchase them again which can end up costing you more than the price you pay for the restorer.|`|k7Pd7Glqaa	You can add two or three drops of nail polish remover to the bottle.  It will be good as new.  Unless you have had it for over 3 or 4 years.   Also, girls,  tip for keeping mascara from getting lumpy:  add a few drops of rubbing alcohol into it about once a month,, this makes a world of difference even of how smooth it will go on after that!|`|5e96e6b6f7e5da9983a0c8703a80dff2aa	i have had that problem. The polish gets all thick and gooey. What i did was I added a little bit of Nail Polish remover into the bottle of nail polish and just shake it. it works. They also sale a special thing called nail polish thinner but it works pretty much the same. hope it helps<br>  <br>  When i've done it, it's worked just fine. just dont add too much. it may be a little dull sometimes but you can just add a clear coat over the top. works like a charm.|`|vuRYpPj2aa	There's nothing you can really do, it'll never be exactly the same. You could add nail polish remover to thin it, but it'll never be the same texture or color. Better off just buying a new bottle.|`|OuFI4ZxKaa	As written above the  answer to your question is to use nail polish remover. Then it's back to life shiny and wonderfulllll!
hVvQKIviaa	Buy some bleach (Sally's Beauty Supply has some good stuff) and just do it yourself. You'll have to bleach it when it grows back it but it's pretty simple to do|`|97krYyP1aa	you mix up the bleach in a dye pot...(if its the powder stuff).<br>  then you get a hair sallon brush and just brush it onto the roots.<br>  its pretty simple<br>  good luck|`|rUa6UC4Saa	i've been dying my hair for years and have never gone to a salon. just go to a beauty supply store and buy 40 volume developer and peroxide, i don't know where u are but i'm in the US and i used this stuff called 'beyond the zone' bleach kit and it works great and comes with everything you need.
GSxPTFSgaa	Before I answer, I want to say that putting on perfume is a telltale sign that you are growing up. You are wearing a scent to make yourself attractive to yourself and the opposite sex. There is no incorrect answer and also many people do not even wear perfume. <br>  <br>  With that all said, I gradually started using perfume. At around 16, I was using calgone body spears. A few years later (19), I decided to invest in perfume and now there is no looking back!|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	uhh like 11. ever since i've been a cologne whore, i love the smell of girls (not in a creepy way ha, like the smell of someone i love(d))|`|GZ0E8Uksaa	Wow, I would say I started wearing During the seventh grade. School dances of course.|`|IQbP2gmraa	uhmm i think i started when i was like 12.|`|JReroESmaa	I've worn perfume my whole life :)<br>  when I was like 5 or 6 my mom used to buy me those colognes from barbie , hello kitty and stuff like that :D|`|tANzRJ4daa	I actually don't think it makes a difference what age you started wearing purfume.

7eN6UERqaa	Snakebites. I've only one side pierced at the moment and am going to get the other side pierced on Saturday, because to be honest, at the moment it just looks kind of lame. But maybe it's just me.<br>  <br>  And it's barely painful, it just kind of feels like someone's pinching you really hard.|`|hVvQKIviaa	You should start off with just one, because snake bites can easily look horrid on a person<br>  They really aren't that painful when you get it done, but for a while talking, eating and drinking can be painful. Especiallllly smiling lol<br>  Compared to other piercings, they hardly hurt ^^|`|A53XeEmqaa	snakebites are two, you dont call one just a snakebite, its just called a lip ring.<br>  but to answer your question i like snakebites.|`|fn5JwyT2aa	Over it|`|2NwI03Mtaa	snakebites! really if you don't like it take one off. yay

You could get it in the middle or on the side or both sides or whatever. Or your monroe. Um... if you have dimples, get your cheeks pierced like Pixie on LA Ink. lol I'm starting to think that's kinda cute. I don't know what sort of piercings you like. There's lots more facial piercings like your bridge or like underneath your eye.. sorta like an eyebrow piercing but its actually right below, idk if there's a real name for it but I saw someone with it the other day.

tkSXjqhuaa	AH! Finally, something I know. <br>  <br>  No, they dont rub off, but I would suggest getting it done the day before so you can shower (your not supposed to shower until about 6-8 hours after spray tanning). You should have no problem with it. I have tons of brides that get spray tans a day before their wedding and their JUST fine.<br>  <br>  Edit- Even two days before should work out JUST fine. Congrats!|`|lGcpXteaaa	I use the fake tans..but wasnt by a machine, an actual person so im not 100% sure its the same thing.<br>  But, with the ones i get, you have to shower after 24 hours of having it done. This takes all the remainder of the fake tan off and will no longer rub off on clothes etc...<br>  As long as you take the shower before you wear the dress i would think its perfectly fine.<br>  I had light couloured prom dress and it didnt rub off on that one bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats hun!!
nVt2Bzavaa	Put a medium colored brown on your lids, a slighty darker brown in your crease. Line your eyes with dark brown liner half way on top and half way on the bottom and smudge. Then put on a couple of coats of mascara. Put on a little blush and a little lip gloss and there ya go!|`|gDxrdyNqaa	for the eye shadow white with the pale hint of brown blend  brown mascara|`|sgs42cMXaa	I can't tell if its brown or purple.<br>  <br>  But what I would do, is start out with a cream color base (or like a cream colored cream eye shadow) then I would put light purple (or brown) all over the lid, but not go above the crease. Then with a slightly darker color than the one you put on the lid, I would start at the outer corner of your eye, and work it up into the crease, leaving the lid color visible. Then with black or a really dark color, I would start at the outer corner, and blend it just a little ways onto the lid, but not alot, and then go right under your lower lashline with that same color, but not all the way across. Then put eyeliner on your water line (that wet part in your eye right above your lower lashline) and maybe some liquid liner on top, then mascara. But just a little, cause I don't think she wears much mascara.

OR get a streak. ;D|`|5urq0LDyaa	oh god i remember 7th grade that was fun. good luck you'll hav a great time. do what i did, get a straightener, play with your hair. pick out a random box of hair dye, and throw some streaks in it. pig tails, they look even cuter if you take the hair thats going in the pig tails and flip it out all crazy and then put it in the pig tails, makes it go everywhere but keeps it in place. looks cool, kinda punk. side bangs, layers, hair dye, braids in random spots, its so fun. haha my first few weeks of grade eight i dyed my whole head pink =] it was awesome. oh something i liked doing was braiding a chunk of my hair and putting some hair dye on it, looks weird, maybe not for gr.7. still fun though lol. good luck, hope it turns out great =]
jswDLpJzaa	Yes you can get several uses out of even the "cheapie" brands, just make sure you remove the glue & any makeup after you take them off (makeup removers work well as do astringents) & use only a minimal amount of the glue by applying the glue to the false lash line with a toothpick or safety pin etc... When they start to lose their shape, or just don't look right (usually after 4-7 uses) it's time to get a new pair.|`|2NwI03Mtaa	yes just clean them , use the glue the lashes come with and there re-usable!|`|3d6d798df3efc3fbc6eccc6d6f1eea40aa	you can reuse them but you should make sure you clean thm esp by removing old makeup and the glue because it can really build up and have bateria and get in your eyes, and thats just gross and bad for your eyes, ive come across a really good video tutorial for cleaning them, check it out, its extremely easy and pretty informative<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIvwND0Sm90" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIvwND0Sm...</a> <br>  <br>  you can add your own methods if you want like extra rinsing with water, other than that i would stick to what he said in the video, <br>  <br>  if you run out of glue you can buy it seperately at walmart and most drugstores, most of them come with it but just saying in case it doesnt or in case you run out|`|gDxrdyNqaa	false eyelashes are reusable :) i have many myself <br>  <br>  you just apply them like normal really like when you just got them you apply them thats all you do when anting to use them there isnt anything you have to do when they have been used <br>  i kinda make no sense but i kinda do|`|UKBx90hdaa	yes, clean them with a cotton swab dipped in makeup remover and wipe off any extra glue residue, then apply the glue and apply to your lashes, only keep lashes for about 2-4wks though they tend to loose shape and can carry bacteria|`|n41yoBzFaa	I suppose they can be re-used. Just get some eye lash glue to make sure that they are still sticky enough to stay on. I don't think you want them to be falling off during the day. You might get some funny looks :)

kW9WBkZtaa	i think both of the dresses are acceptable, but i feel as though the second one is a bit more younger feeling(:<br>  probably because it doesnt hug your body as much and just flows<br>  and hey, who cares if its not approriate?<br>  red is a fierce color! (:|`|uTW2KW9raa	I dint know if reds the best color for a wedding - try to go with more neutral colors.. soft colors.. but not white.<br>  <br>  I agree with the person above though, the second one is defiantly more young. So depends on your age. Also go with one that suits you best - sometimes they can be really mmisinterpretedon other people with different body shapes.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	I like choice 1 but WITHOUT the belt as the belt make it look casual.|`|4e75214dd69cb400fba95f596db55087aa	I wouldn't wear red.. bcuz the attention should focus on the bride<br>  Try another color<br>  The first is cute just not red|`|3RqZBgY4aa	They are both OK for something like a wedding reception.  If the wedding is a relegious type, then I have to go with the impossed conservatism of the religious institution that it may be a little too taboo.  If it is a casual type of wedding, as long as your body type approximates that of the models in your pics.....go for it.  Also, I think the second (shoulderless) dress is the best of the two.  Good luck.|`|Az9keOz5aa	The first dress looks too Holywood,maybe without the belt? But I really like the 2d dress,a lot more for weddings,but try diff colors,reads aren't really good for weddings,try light colors like pinks,light reds,blues,lime greens,etc. Have fun!!|`|AAMtVsLCaa	Depends how casual it is.... If it is then they would be cute! The second is better cuz it's not as flashy and stand our cuz the bride should be the one focused on.. If it is formal then go with a less extreme color.. But don't forget to get really cute shoes purse and accessories|`|NngQBXAPaa	Personally i dont like either, but If i had to choose ild go for the first..but i hate it lol, if it was halter it woulda been really nice! Again it would depend on the wedding, church or backyard? Definately the first one isnt for church!|`|fxwKFJefaa	DRESS ONE IS HIDEOUS!!!!! <br>  ok sorry. now.<br>  dress two is really nice, it just depends whether it is appropriate for the wedding. is it formal? is it inside? is it an older or younger crowd? will it be a party wedding?<br>  etc|`|sgs42cMXaa	I don't think I'd wear red to a wedding. Its sexy, but very attention grabbing at an occasion where all the attention should go to the lady in white, lol. But if they come in other colors then I think they'd be great!|`|cVKiy4cYaa	the second one, you don't want to have everyone staring at you in the first dress...although the first dress looks really hot ): i want it..but anyways! the second one seems better, you'll still look good and it wont be too show-offy|`|eip5YPZ1aa	CHOICE 1, WITHOUT THE BELT (IT LOOKS TOO CASUAL).<br>  ALTHOUGH, I REALLY LIKE THE COLOR OF THE DRESS, AND THE ONE SHOULDER STYLE!<br>  THOSE ARE PERFECT DRESSES FOR A WEDDING=)<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN!|`|QMYNU9uNaa	I like the first one the best!|`|B7idbFNVaa	You MUST look VERY SEXY to wear something like that, MISS.<br>  BUT I don't agree with the color RED,, it tends to be a DOMINATED COLOR which CATCHES OTHER PEOPLE ATTENTION. THAT is something you don't want to DO because we want OUR FULL ATTENTION for the BRIDE.  Go for something of NEUTRAL COLORS, colors that will BEND in with the CROWD.<br>  <br>  Just don't wear something BETTER THAN the BRIDE or GET more ATTENTION than the BRIDE. <br>  REMEMBER to CATCH THE BROCADE!!!!!

AA10415600	I think a nose stud can be very becoming on a young woman.  You have to be at least 16, i believe, to get it without parental consent.  If you do work or are thinking about a job, however, you need to check with them about it if you want to wear it at work.  Many places, especially in customer service jobs, they usually have a "no facial piercing" policy, at least the ones I've worked at.  I know when I go to Petsmart to pick up fish stuff, there are a couple of girls with studs who work there, but they have to cover them up with a skin-colored bandage. Just a little heads up. But, honestly, if it's something you want, go for it.  Your only young once.|`|dat8eoYyaa	what if boogers and nose hairs get crusted around it...|`|lCXlWhveaa	i pierced my nose myself to get it done at a parlar you have to be 16 and i wouldn't get it done any younger , the aftercare is as you know very simple and it was one of my least painful piercings and in my opinion one of the most socially acceptable  do what makes you happy and feel beautiful    and not getting something because of what people think is the same as doing things because others tell you i say do it :)|`|Y4JGEB0raa	you have to be 18 if you are on your own and any other age if you have a parent. i got mine done by a professional. didn't hurt afterwards (unless bumped, just gotta be careful).

AA10729271	Well, if you really want wavy hair and you have straight hair you have two choices:<br>  <br>  1. Get a semi-permanent wave (aka perm)<br>  <br>  2. Or use curl enhancing products<br>  <br>  It's either or, trust me I speak from many years of experience of styling my straight hair.<br>  <br>  The easiest and least expensive method would be to do a quick scrunch wave, this is probably the best bet for a guy, and will look the most 'natural' because if you try to use rollers or an iron it will be obvious.<br>  <br>  It's easy, all you need is a curl enhancing mouse, I think L'oreal has a good product like this. After a shower towel dry your hair so that it is damp but not dripping. Put a golf ball sized amount of mouse foam in your palm. Turn you head upside down and then work the foam between your palms, apply the foam to your hair using a scrunching motion (a hand-full of hair at a time) so that the mouse is worked into your hair. Then as your hair drys occasionally scrunch it to define the wave a little more. With shorter hair it will only take about a half an hour to dry. <br>  <br>  The secret to this look is that you don't comb your hair with anything other than your fingers, that is curl secret 101 --no comb's allowed, unless u have a fro and then you can use a pick, but other than that fingers only. After is dries you can use a some light hold hair spray, it's not necessary, but the look will last longer.<br>  <br>  Also, making waves takes some skill, so if you don't like the way it looks, spray on some water, comb smooth, and then scrunch again, once you've got the technique down though it only takes a few minutes. This is my go to look for busy mornings when I don't have time to dry my hair, i do the scrunch wave and then by the time I'm at work it's mostly dry.|`|YA3JJwE3aa	You have to be born with it.|`|ilRy28hUaa	u can perm it. go 2 the salon & get rods in it and they can perm it. it might run u 50 and up depending where u go.  hope i helpd -)|`|m3K0VsRzaa	perhaps investing in a curler or even a GHD would help you out a lot<br>  OR<br>  you could maybe get a perm at a hair salon lol

sOkTUYq7aa	yes<br>  try burt bee's|`|AA12081795	u can use tomato on normal to combination skin type.
JcJSLAF6aa	Because its the "fashion". It's what's "in" and what the media is promoting. Models/celebrities are carved to symbolize "perfection"...the perfect complexion, the perfect skin, height, weight...but they end up just being fake.<br>  And most of the time, unhappy.<br>  <br>  I just think skinny is considered beautiful because it uses up less cloth, and therefore less money is needed to make the clothing. Skinny people are cheap :D (lol corny but it helps)<br>  <br>  Corny and cliche, but each girl is beautiful in her own way, seriously. Each person has a personality and something their good at. Focus on those and you'll get farther in the world.<br>  <br>  Those who are considered skinny mostly live their life with beauty, and not intellect. They live under a rock where theres so much they can learn.<br>  <br>  And, besides, most "beautiful" skinny girls have eating disorders...and they end up dying.<br>  <br>  would you like to die happy, loving yourself? or die sad and miserable, wanted to be called beautiful and be skinny?<br>  <br>  gosh, this just made me super hungry :D|`|MRRjPy0qaa	Don't feel that way, skinny is definitely not beautiful, it's just the way the media presents it so that's how society thinks. Nicole Ritchie is too skinny if I was a guy that would be a major turn off, she definitely need to gain weight. Don't let the media get to you. Just as long as your weight (according to your height) is around the normal range you should have nothing to worry about.|`|LBegVRCEaa	Hi =]<br>  <br>  If you're referring to the twig like runway models then no, they are not beautiful, not even close. The designers don't consider them beautiful, they are merely coat hangers, and it's true, they do hang a frock well. Go look at some of the original supermodels, they seem really healthy compared to the ones today. In real life, when you see a pretty girl, she's not always a stick is she? Usually, they are not, they are healthy. People in Hollywood live in their own twisted world, don't look up to them, actually, look up to the ones who are healthy. Eg. Kate Winslet, Tyra Banks, Scarlett Johannson....<br>  <br>  Good luck =]<br>  Darnie.|`|uYJdvnqxaa	Because that's what society currently believes.Because models have to be a size zero,so everyone else thinks people should be that way too.Except models only eat a celery stick a day.I don't think starving yourself is beautiful at all.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with being healthy.<br>  Because as you may have noticed,everyone calls Nicole Richie unhealthy,anorexic,and she gets bashed on.|`|rYxIs47Gaa	Well Nicole Richie is to skinny...now being skinny is <br>  1. Good for your health <br>  2. Considered beautiful because small with curves is hot to a guy bc he can throw you around while having sex<br>  3. Also a lot of people lose their beauty when they become overweight it changes your looks dramatically|`|yy8WPgXzaa	skinny can be beautiful, but so is curvy (:<br>  i believe it is how the person carries themselves, <br>  have confidence and believe you are beautiful, and others will see it too (:|`|soEQJRtuaa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder! My personal opinion of really skinny girls is that it is definitely not attractive at all. Anorexia is not sexy ! It's a disease!|`|DvwJmahvaa	my spouse of 8 years is leaving me for an anorexic looking girl<br>  <br>  <br>  ive stopped eating since<br>  <br>  <br>  so yeah i understand|`|WTf21t9Jaa	Because that's what fashion and the media says. <br>  A lot of guys prefer girls with curves though, looking at all the polls on here:)<br>  I think as long as you look healthy and have confidence, you look great and shouldn't worry about it all.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Bella nailed it on the head.  In the past only the rich could afford to eat not only enough food, but rich food and weight was therefore a sign of wealth and status.  Now a-days that extra cushion is associated with over-consumption which in out society isn't a sign of wealth so much as a sign of too many sodas and potato chips.  Trim is the new fat because most people have to work hard to get it.  That doesn't make skinny more "beautiful" just more desired at the moment because its not an easy commodity.  Things that are harder to have drive desire to have them.|`|wWdQSuCbaa	I think ANY size is beautiful. <br>  and I'll have to disagree with you, Skinny is not always beautiful, skinny doesnt fit every girl. <br>  Besides, hey, its all about the inside, not the outside.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	It is because of tv shows like Top model. If your not aanorexicthen your fat and ugly. It is ssickening If you are on this site aallotyou will see children asking about losing weight at a young age. This iisn'twhat our little kids need to be concerned with.|`|C2k4gK0Baa	im really skinny...................

AA11604056	i think you have a beautiful natural tone. it's definitely brown. at first i thought it had an ash tone but no, it s a brown<br>  <br>  highlights are always difficult. i recommend something natural, like a chamomile wash or vinegar with rosemary (works well in the summer)<br>  <br>  but why do you want to highlight it at all? it's beautiful, glossy and natural!|`|Zlg9sXvUaa	Your hair color is greyish Blue as in the pic, it  looks cool girl. I  am sure you do have a great choice.<br>  <br>  you can high light your hair color with a blond color streak.

When your hair is long enough, just go without 'em.  The girl in the pic MIGHT be wearing extensions.. but I'm not exactly sure.  The hair on the second half on her head doesn't match the first half though.  It could be that she didn't match her extensions to her natural hair well enough, or maybe her hair is just funky like that.  Haha.|`|xOH3Wxwxaa	I have seen many girls with this type of hair, and while it is certainly cute on these girls, they have answered that it is extensions. I know you can buy them in your hair color or you can buy colored hair extensions. So that is up to you.|`|hVvQKIviaa	Growing your own hair is always better than extensions<br>  <br>  It looks like her hair could be extensions, but I can't be sure|`|MXpW48lFaa	Both. You should buy some extensions and use them for now. When your hair grows out you won't need them. But it will still be good if you keep the extensions for maybe later on if you cut your hair.|`|NHvYiT27aa	yer shes wearing extensions and it just depends on what u want if u want long hair like NOW then buy extensions cause its not like your hair will grow in a week and u can always just take em out again if u bored of it so yer

My friend has the coolest though: two sparrows on the top of each foot facing eachother, holding a banner with each of her parent's names on each one. she's getting them colored in this summer. <br>  <br>  i also fell in love with her plans for her next one. she wants a ginormous cherry blossom tree coming up across her back. the roots go farther down and stop just before her butt. and the tree branches carry on across the sides of her shoulders. (this is my least favorite part---->) then she wants two dragons wrapping in the tree and one  of their heads will go over one of her shoulders, and the other's head witll be over  her other shoulder.<br>  <br>  wow i typed alot :p<br>  but i love love love those ideas! :D|`|fUz875ljaa	The word's  tattoo designs comes from the word tattoo which is said to has two major derivations from the Polynesian word ‘ta’ which means striking something and the Tahitian word ‘tatau’ which means ‘to mark something'.

It sounds like your new to tattoos, so you might not want to go that big right away. I do suggest you get one of them (fairy,etc.) first and then you could design a backpiece from that eventually. <br>  As far as piercings, there are many! I'll start with what I have that you don't: septum, cheeks, labrae, tongue, and belly button. Others could be: bridge, snake bites, Monroe, surface, etc. I would suggest searching online for a piercing site for more ideas, like bme.com.
6fad9dcd0b28bbd940748b793edf7be8aa	No! For God's sake don't go to one of the professed "schools". Find a professional piercer who can give you a full apprenticeship. Schools for  tattooing and piercing just pump people through as fast as possible without giving them time to practice and get one on one hands on experience.|`|aXqtzNIraa	Apprenticeship all the way, write letters to every piercing studio in your area with a letter explain why you want to get into piercer and that you'd like an opportunity for an apprenticeship along with a copy of your cv. Or go into these shops in person and explain.<br>  <br>  It won't be easy but it will be worth it
gzaVGE4Qaa	Hair dye takes better when you've bleached your hair, so if you recently bleached it'll stick pretty well, however I find that Manic Panic begins to fade fairly quickly, within weeks. You don't keep it in overnight, that sounds like a good way to dye your skin. Leave it in for an hour then wash it out. Or better yet, follow the directions on the container. Good luck!<br>  <br>  If you're bleachinig your hair next time and you want a nice light blonde, you can put the bleach in, then wrap your hair with plastic wrap, it makes it work better and faster.
DZkkYK0Baa	I had the area under my left eye pierced professionally at a tattoo/piercing parlor. After that, I had my ear lobes pierced in the mall (haha). My last and most recent piercings were the two on my top lip, which were done at the same place as the first piercing. I have all piercings to this day except for the one under my left eye.<br>  <br>  I love piercings and body mods. They intrigue me. I like to stand out and be different. I am very much aware of how many people are disgusted and fully against piercings and other body modifications, but, frankly, I don't care. It's my own body and I can do whatever I want with it!|`|5dMw30kMaa	I got my ears pierced just once in the lobes because I think earrings are pretty and I wanted to wear them :) Then my friend back in 6th grade got her ears pierced twice and I was jealous so I got mine pierced a second time. hahaha.

DQlZIzAFaa	If the instructions say like "leave the dye in for an hour" or something, then leave it in for 45 minutes or something. The shorter you leave it in your hair, the less it will seep into your hair.|`|u53ISZoXaa	people use vasaline on there skin so the dye doesnt stain it, you coudl try just putting a little bit on the parts you want dyed, but it would be a pain to get out the greasyness.  You can also just wash it immediatly after you put it in.  Although this will make it very light and faded looking.  You only live once, why not have a strand of pink hair or two for a month.  I have had pink hair for the last 6 years.  I can't imagine living without it!|`|1bdaoRoAaa	first of all let me just warn you, having used semi-permanent dye myself. <br>  it runs baaaaddddd! everything you own WILL turn pink  (but prolly not as much since you are only doing a few strands and not your whole head) depending on the brand it fades pretty quick too. if you have naturally dark hair the pink won't show up very well if at all. the lighter your hair the better it will show up and the less you have to leave it on.<br>  if you want it very bright I suggest putting it in covering your head in a shower cap (or something similar) and sleeping with the dye on your hair then when you wake up wash it out. get yourself some shampoo for color treated hair (even though the rest of your hair isn't dyed). try to wash your hair in as cold of water as you can stand. (I admit I can't adhere to this one even though I have dyed red hair. I can't stand cold water but if you can stand it I hear it works well).|`|qxddYXMGaa	Well since you have bought a permanent hair dye, if you want a hair dye that isn't permanent and you haven't used the permanent one then you could easily take the permanent one back to the shop.  p.s. do not dye it too many times because your hair will fall out!

H7qhcFBzaa	i would wait until it starts peeling. Then when you sweat, lightly pat it dry..|`|e64iph1Caa	If you got it last week, you should be good to go by now. I took a break from working out when I first got mine, but I was still doing construction work then and it didnt seem to effect it.|`|5PqD4k3Raa	No need to worry about your tattoo being affected by working out. I have 2 tats that are fairly large on my arms and i do a lot of working out let me tell you! <br>  <br>  No affect on the tattoos, they are only millimeters deep-- no worries!|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	I don't know exactly, but with experience of having tattoos, I would say a week. The first week of the healing process is the most crusial part of your tattoos future. Sweat can also cause infections and stuff in tattoos and piercings. If you heal faster than most people than maybe you will only need a few days. Everybodys skin and immune system is different.

qdXGueBeaa	go to www.infectiousthreads.com<br>  <br>  Its not an australian site, but it is cheaper to by from overseas. All the lip service, demonia and other goth/punk stuff is so ridiculously expenive here in australia, it literally works out cheaper to pay extra postage and have it shipped over. The site I put above it pretty cheap and has heaps of awesome stuff, by lip service and other brands.<br>  <br>  But if you happen to have a Off Ya Tree store near you, im pretty sure they have lip service too. It would be more expensive, but you wouldnt have to buy online.
jWmnSXlLaa	It isnt funny at all. If you use glue you keep them  on it can damage his nails not to mention the 30 bucks to have them removed. What if you accidently get it on his hand in the mix? This has horriable friend written all over it !|`|GZKbvXLLaa	Sorry, but I fail to see the humor in this. I can't help you out. This prank is awfully juvenile , in my opinion.|`|5gFmloyaaa	To be honest its a harmless prank because he can get them taken off the next day.  Most girls stop at painting a guys nails, this leaves more to the objective of a prank that is usually to embarrass someone.  I think as long as you pay for the manicure, the only bad thing is he will have sensitive fingernails for a day or two.|`|7f21c7e291997b848d2e257c08fe42a6aa	hahah priceless prank!! <br>  what you want to do is get the fake nails that are already sticky on the back. And then get nail glue. Put two drops of nail glue on his nails. this way they are in better with the sticky and the glue. They will last for like a week and ahalf and no guy wants to go through the pain of having fake nails for almost two weeks haha. <br>  hope this helped, and i would def. love to his face when he wakes up to fake nails! haha|`|6uYVRaebaa	lmao! hilarious! get those rele long ones that come in pks of like a hundred or so at the dollar store, then get nail glue..they don't have to look pretty do they? :P you can paint them....will he be knocked out enough?
kFjNO9Yjaa	wow that looks gorgeous! id be very proud if i was you!|`|NEtVRjplaa	It looks great!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I think it looks great! I'd like to see a larger picture of it but from what I can see your artist has done an absolutely immaculate job. I like to point out constructive criticism (in a nice way!) but I honestly can't pick any out! I love this new school style, it's a great take on the traditional old school stuff while still maintaining that classic look about it. It's not the style I would personally go for, but diversity is what makes us interesting! I really think you should be proud of this. Was this your first? If so, extra kudos for going for the ribs! It's very refreshing to see something decent on here. 95% of these questions open up to a really poor piece of work. Not a poor choice of design, because that's up to the individual, but as in the work itself has been executed poorly, and then you're faced with the whole 'do I be honest, do I lie, do I ignore it' dilemma. So I'm impressed to see something worth boasting about! :-)<br>  <br>  And in response to a few of the answers you've got...<br>  <br>  The person who said it was 'minging' because it's on your leg is very very funny, and very very very stupid. Haha.<br>  <br>  To the one who said she doesn't know why people get tattoos - how does this answer the question? And in this case, why are you in the tattoo section? Get a life, and leave people alone.<br>  <br>  And to the ones who said it should be smaller - firstly, if this design was much smaller it would look very messy, if not now then certainly in a few years time when blurring starts to occur, which is something you always have to consider. Also, a small design would look pretty odd floating in the middle of the ribcage. For some reason, a lot of people seem to be under the impression that girls should only get small tattoos. This is usually a statement said by ignorant people who have no balls, and are usually the type who will pick a bland 2"x1" piece of flash off a wall once or twice in their lives, stick it on the fattiest part of their body where it will hurt the least and call themselves tattooed. Just because you have no guts and imagination doesn't mean everybody else should follow suit. There is nothing in the rulebook to say girls should only have small tattoos or none at all, and as far as I'm concerned kudos to those of us that do, it's a brave thing to do - and I'm not talking about the pain, I'm talking about the lifetime of mindless ignorance we have to put up with from people like you as a result of it.<br>  <br>  Right, glad I got that off my chest :P|`|iCKkOWI7aa	sick :)|`|UYCvwh6Paa	Great motto in the beautifully colorful work of art, you have there. Congratulations!|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Gorgeous <br>  <br>  Probably hurt like a B***h|`|SbsB0bwEaa	cool|`|ba7ca3404efdda930e5ae6442f75c95caa	I like the art and design but come on people with the corney phrases and saying! When people get stuff like that its like their trying to hard you might as well have got live fast die hard! Oh well theres nothing you can do now its there for life. Well look on the bright side at least its not in chinese letters!|`|rSautofoaa	I think it is awesome! The person before who said it needs to be smaller is crazy! It is perfect the way it is. If you would've tried to reduce the size, you would have had to lose a lot of the beautiful detail! I love it.|`|u53ISZoXaa	it looks really good, the choice of colors were good as well!  Kudos to getting your ribs done, that's a very painful spot!  Very nice, and thank god you're one of the few that actually pays for a good artists!|`|gP7XSy9paa	whoah i luv it its awsome|`|1o6S58uCaa	love it :D|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	Good motto, perhaps a bit too expansive.|`|e64iph1Caa	Cool... not something I would be into but the artist did an awesome job!!!!!|`|dat8eoYyaa	love that blue n there !|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	i think it looks pretty good|`|QxSPcQIuaa	Looks good, and a very well done tattoo. My applause to the artist, from one.<br>  I like how there are still 'tattoo haters'. lol. People criticize tattoos for not being original enough, while most of them have plain skin, nor have a creative bone in them.<br>  <br>  There is no Tattoo Rule Book, and its your skin and your form of expression. Chinese lettering, Heart wrapped motto, or whatever, their all personal expressions.|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	I like the style and the color choices. Some people  don't realize that tattoos are art and the colors don't always have to make sence. Nice placement too! I got my ribs done in October and out of my other 15 tattoos, the ribs definetly are the most painful! I like it!|`|IQbP2gmraa	it looks expensive lol and work well done.<br>  but its kinda BIGGGG.<br>  LOL.|`|AA11993240	ur tatt is ****** hot and very true! i like it!|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	I like it, very vivid and well drawn out. As long as it means something to you, you can't go wrong so i'd be excited someone did a great job on your artwork.|`|NpV324Niaa	That tattoo looks really good on your toned body. The design and colors look great. I have never read that saying either, and I liked it. Right on.|`|OXOHoISraa	very pretty.  I particularly like the blue on the roses as opposed to the traditional yellow.|`|dISHCaqhaa	Wow what a superb tattoo. The writings in the tattoo is so nice.<br>  I can feel how pain you got while writing.<br>  Kudos to u.|`|8h5gXadiaa	The rose spoils... From far, it looks like a dragonfruit to me...|`|Cu6kOvdiaa	hella sick|`|2NwI03Mtaa	omg that is very pretty!|`|bVTrhse0aa	Would be nice, just needed to be smaller!|`|AA12084342	that is really nice and love the saying by the way (:|`|QkzaRD9Iaa	its lovely...i think its very cool|`|ouUkY2t7aa	That's actually really cool. I like where you placed it also.<br>  <br>  I was hoping you weren't going to be another person with chinese writing tattooed on you and you don't even have a clue how to speak chinese. Why do people get chinese writing tattooed on them when they don't speak chinese, they've never been to china, and have no chinese background?<br>  <br>  ktheartsop: Nobody asked if you understood why people get tattoos. Please ask your own question instead of hijacking somebody else's.|`|wUIJSSJlaa	wow that looks great!|`|E01GXmQeaa	that looks great and doesn't need to be smaller at all. kudos.|`|dac5acd3494550f33901e9e60a51e052aa	its beautiful...too big for me...but its immaculate. congrats.|`|MH7meZtOaa	Nice very nice :-)|`|xNRpjAnwaa	really cute!!|`|paRweQ8Zaa	thats really nice :) x
8q82dLS8aa	tats are trashy<br>  <br>  please don't get one. stop the grossness.|`|oDMEYSKjaa	I read a book while I was getting mine done. lol <br>  Anytime I watched the tattooist going away at my leg, it would cause more pain. So I simply read a book they had in the shop. lmao. It was funny too coz when other people walked by, they were all like, wow! She's ******* reading a book! And they were like and this is her first one! hahaha. It was funny to see there reactions considering I look like a baby to begin with. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vvdq1QHoaa	I just got my first tattoo last year and I am deathly afraid of needles but to tell you the truth I would rather get another tattoo before I get my ears pierced again... My tattooist was very nice and would let me take breaks. I also got one on my pack an it does hurt but its more of an annoying I want to scratch sort of hurt. The only drawback is that I started having a bit of nausea but it went a way once I had a minute to breath. Its great the only thing you have to watch out for is not getting addicted to it. I still only have one but I am planning on getting a matching one with my sister.|`|NVuvP8kIaa	Well when I got my first tat the lady doing it was super informative and nice. I hope you have a good experience too! It basically feels like a bee stinging you over and over (I know it sounds bad but its more annoying than anything else)<br>  Have them do a "test" section w/o ink so you can experience what it's going to feel like and see if you can handle it. <br>  Just breathe, it's nerve wracking but after the first couple minutes you adjust. <br>  My friend and I did it together and I was fine, she turned white and almost fainted after it got half way done lol <br>  It really is not that bad, it's all in your mind|`|JfOuzOJGaa	If it's a small tattoo, then it shouldn't take too long, so when the endorphins kick in, it shouldn't be too painful.  It'll feel like a slightly stinging vibration.  Just concentrate on even, deep breathing.  It's really not that big of an ordeal, so don't build it up too much in your mind.  Make sure you eat before you go and maybe take a soda with you in case you get dizzy and feel like you're gonna pass out.|`|6FdNYjl5aa	After the initial prick of the ink pen if you breath and relax you can bear it, however, if it is over a bony prominence it will hurt more. If you are  of legal age have a glass of wine and listen to some smooth music before you go and know that it is mind over matter and take control of your mind.|`|a3Sc1B8zaa	My girlfriend has 2 tattoos on her lower back and from what she told me they weren't very pleasant. I have one on my wrist and one on each bicep. The biceps weren't bad at all. The one on my wrist hurt like a biatch, though. If you've ever had a sunburn, getting a tattoo feels like bumping that sunburn on something. It also depends on how deep the artist decides to go. Generally, the deeper they go the better the tattoo will look after it heals and will keep color better, but they also hurt more =)<br>  <br>  It's not a bad experience if you've got a reasonable threshold for pain. Just try to stay relaxed. Take an iPod or something and listen to music (most artists will listen to their own while doing the job).<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  <br>  I do not recommend you take pain medicine as one other suggested. These thin your blood (not excessively, like alcohol would). This COULD cause the ink not to set in as well.|`|nVBybOQOaa	Ignore the "tramp stamp" people..they're just jerks.<br>  <br>  I have a really large back piece done and it took a few sittings to do. First of all it won't hurt as much as you think it will...trust me. You can take in an ipod or as someone mentioned a book, the only time that you'll feel the pain is when you think about it, so if you even think about other things maybe like surfing or something you enjoy doing you won't feel the pain.<br>  <br>  My tattoo parlor has huge television on one of the walls so you can watch a movie while you get inked, awesome idea.|`|PtR4cmDCaa	ok this is an easy one for me..i got my tattoo a couple weeks ago and i got it in between my shoulder blades. it doesn't hurt to bad (i can stand pain)..the noise made me more nervious dont worry about it ..okay what i did is i took tylanal b4..then during it i talked to the tattoo artist and listand to my ipod..you wont think about what they are doin if you keep your mind busy. so listan to sumptin like your ipod that u can really get into .. and b4 you kno it youll have a new tattoo.. Hope it helps..if you have any other questions just email me|`|5urq0LDyaa	deep breaths help. bring a friend to hold your hand, you might not need the hand holding but just the reassurance of knowing if it starts to hurt you can squeeze their hand helps. it feels just like poking yourself with a needle but over and over again and kinda vibrates. lol. you get used to it immediatlly. try and keep conversation going with ur buddy. and just think of how great its gonna look when its done =]<br>  <br>  good luck and think of it this way. if i [a 14 year old girl] can get through it, so can you lol =]|`|ptfKE8zJaa	You need to know that its permanint! whatever you get will be there forever! if your thinking about being a rocker kinda girl then get ya tatto anywear but if ur gunna get seriouse in the future than put it somwear not so noticeable. so ya and dont get drunk and do it it turns out bad sometime and ya lol good luck :)|`|9x4kFeMyaa	First off DON'T TAKE ADVIL!<br>  it promotes bleeding.<br>  i got my first tattoo on my back just below my neck and it did not hurt. the only part that was a little painful was the shading when he was shading on my spine. it only hurt for a minute then you kinda get used to and it becomes kinda relaxing.|`|H7qhcFBzaa	I would take some ibuprofen or Advil before any tattoo, not only to not get a headache but to calm the nerves.<br>  Also, the pain is almost like a bee sting, over and over. So, it is pretty tolerable.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|rFYy7cRyaa	dont drink before|`|AA11993240	Depending on where u want it depends on how sensitive it will be. if u get it closer to ur side its gonna hurt worse than say the middle of ur back but then again people r different. if u wanna keep urself calm, just think of it as ur scratching an itch. u dont wanna take tylenol before u go cuz theres a risk of excessive bleeding since its a blood thinner. i hope this helps.|`|QxSPcQIuaa	I've tattooed lots of people, some of them completely plastered drunk, and alcohol doesn't thin your blood, nor would advil. Firstly, if your bleeding that bad, the artist is going too deep. If its absolutely excruciating he or she is also going too deep. Lots of people get tattoos by people who scar them and turn their skin in to hamburger, and a common "excuse" is to blame it on the patient. <br>  <br>  Tattooing drunk people is frustrating, and never done because so. Plus a person cant be expected to make good judgment or understand the risks while drunk. Yet there is a world of difference between 2 drinks and drunk, and the drunks I've tattooed were close friends.<br>  <br>  A tattoo goes no deeper then 3/32nds of an inch deep, your skins major blood vessels are below that, but not by much. However your nerves sense the injury no different then if you were being cut open at times. Solid colors will be more painful, since it requires more ink.<br>  <br>  Our nerves on the skin tend to bunch up, which is why its no problem most of the times, and once in awhile it smarts real good.<br>  <br>  I suggest you have 2 drinks 1/2 hour before your tattoo if your concerned about the pain. It will take the edge off both the pain, and the anxiety. Anxiety is common, and always worse then pain and fades away once the tattoo has begun.<br>  <br>  The back can be a painful spot, yet there are 'numbing agents' that your local tattoo parlor should have handy. They help if the tattoo is large, but only after the outline is done.<br>  <br>  99% of people says "it was no where bad as I thought it would be". I'm not a masochistic but I like the pain, only cause I love the gain. Yet I know of a few people who have no tolerance for the pain, one of them was an aspiring artist.<br>  <br>  A side from tolerating the pain, you have to resist the urge to twitch or move. That is very important at times, but you don't have to turn in to a statue for the whole procedure.
NngQBXAPaa	Classy casual man for me, jeans with dress pants and a classy-like casual jacket with a shirt underneath or a half unbuttoned shirt :) I would like a man dressed casually only if he looks neat, from "hair" to toe!|`|JReroESmaa	yeaah !!

Nicely tailored cut and clean. Suits, shirts and pants and professional business wear are all good for work-wear if you work in a place like an office or something.<br>  <br>  When your buying clothes its always good to talk to the shop assistant there - especially if its a girl; which it would be mostly. They will give the most help because all women basically think similar about mens fashion.|`|rKdwqlgwaa	UGH i hate guys that look like they spent more time on their outfit than i did on mine!! (and i usually take a long time!!)  guys that are too obsessed w/ their image is a turn off. However a guy who is fashion conscience (however you spell that :P) is rele nice.

B78YaVHyaa	1) make a pouf. pull your bangs back, pull the hair slightly forward and secure with a clip. this can be worn with tied up or down-hair. works with curls, straighteners as well as waves. use the pouf with all 3.. the look will be different.<br>  <br>  2) a side ponytail. tie your curly hair into a ponytail and pull it to the side, leaving some loose tendrils on your face. the side ponytail works best with curly or wavy hair.<br>  <br>  3) pigtails.. this may sound a bit juvenile to you, but it can look really cute. part your hair from the back into two even portions then tie both up into pigtails. this works with both straight and curly hair. you can also combine the pigtails with a pouf.<br>  <br>  4) leave your hair open on some days with just a funky clip to pull back your bangs.<br>  <br>  5) use an aliceband to pull back all the hair from your face whilst leaving your hair open|`|8qbp6xWQaa	Lol my hair is kinda like urs.<br>  I usually just let it down. <br>  Uhm.. Tying ur hair looks nice. Like leave some hair left on the side.<br>  And maybe u could pull ur front hair back. Idk if that works for side bangs tho.<br>  Curling it a little looks nice too.

mzLMkdbQaa	Your pores dont actually "open" or "close". They soften and harden, and I'd recommend using hot water to soften your pores right before you wash your face with whichever cleanser you use, and rinse with cold cold water to harden the pores back up from preventing any bacteria to get in them.|`|3sM4PS3yaa	yup thats the trick!

Key is to use proper products for your skin, you want to control the break outs by removing surface dirt and the various other things that clog your pores but you also do not want to dehydrate your skin completely.   Try using a night cream that controls sebum production, I found I have great results with Vichy Normaderm (the night cream only!)  I found that it's day cream clogged my pores and aggravated things.  Unfortunately you will find that what I may swear by in terms of products, may be horrendous for you, that is my experience and unfortunately a large part is poking around and trying various products till you find the ones that work for you and sticking to you regimen once you achieve results.  Like I said 80% of the battle is cleansing your face systematically and  use of your products to rid yourself of the surface elements which clog your pores.   And whatever you do, do not and I cannot stress this enough pop your pimples.  Resist the urge, you'll regret it when you scar up your face.  A facial from a good esthetician would hurt once in a while for the extractions.  But your success is not determined by that.  Not to knock the proffession, cause when things got out of hand for me I sought out mine and have been a client of hers for years, and she set me on the right path.  All of which I said to you now.|`|i0UPqaL4aa	Stop using harsh chemical products that are on the market and use more natural ones. You wont see the results in 2 days, but the results will be gradual and flawless. I would suggest using a mild natural soap or castile soap. Then use a toner like PURE witch hazel or tea tree oil. Go to a health food store so that you get the real thing. A lot of stuff that you find at the local drug store is either watered down or has added chemicals. Then MOISTURIZE. DO NOT FORGET THIS. It may seem like you would want to dry out the pimples, but drying your skin only makes the problem worse; your skin will react by creating more oil, and therefore more pimples. Finally, DO NOT SQUEEZE your pimples. They leave horrible scars. If you see a pimple that is about to burst, pull the skin AWAY (instead of squeezing). If it is ready to come out, it should come out easily.|`|lJjrfgJdaa	You should just use a mild facewash w/out a bunch of medication that will dry and irritate your skin. And then some toner when you break out and a good spot treatment like Clean and Clear Persa Gel when you go to bed. Wash twice a day, and you should be on your way to better looking skin.
JcJSLAF6aa	Red hair is awesome :D, and i think it looks fine<br>  only thing that bugs me is probably the roots<br>  try and make it more "natural?"|`|Bx7F9jscaa	You should dye your roots. It's a good color but it looks like it was all magenta and it grew out.|`|XADP739faa	I'd like it if you had your natural colour then red tips or high lights|`|YnEKOJayaa	umm no offense but that shi t is horrendous!<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry hun :)|`|Syn2excFaa	Nothing wrong with your hair in my opinion.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	very cute, and it does have a reddy tone, but to me it does look more pinky|`|DZkkYK0Baa	Wow, that is gorgeous.

ilRy28hUaa	did u go 2 the same one? they might need 2 use a diff base 2 conteract that orange. ^ u cud get highlights but theyll have 2 use a toner anyway|`|DZkkYK0Baa	I'm not 100% sure on this one, but you could try stripping the color with Color Oops or bleaching (though, that is very damaging, of course). Perhaps dye your hair a very dark, powerful color like black. Permenant of course.<br>  <br>  Orange...hm. Try a toner that removes orange tones and see what that does. I'd say that's worth a try, really. If not, try above suggestions.
6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	Personally, I don't apply foundation and powder. If you have a couple of pimples, why should you cake your entire face with foundation? It's just adding more harm to your skin.<br>  If you want even coverage, you could apply foundation and powder. It's your choice though.<br>  So if you feel like you wanna make your face flawless and more beautiful than it already is, go ahead. <br>  Good luck!|`|RBM5yhK6aa	there are a lot of foundations that you can find that don't need you to wear any powder with them.<br>  <br>  there's this fabulous dior airflash makeup which is an airbrush makeup and all you need to do is spray it on your face.<br>  <br>  but if you're looking at something less pricier, look at maybelline dream matte mouse makeup. it comes in a little jar and all you need to do is moisturize your face, apply this mouse makeup and your set for the day.|`|7f21c7e291997b848d2e257c08fe42a6aa	If you feel more comfortable with wearing foundation then i would use just a tad bit of powder to seal it together and it gives it a nice touch. But if your okay with not wearing foundation then powder look just perfect too (: hope i helped.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	It is your preference. If you like how you look without the makeup then threes no sense in using it. Save the money and your skin.|`|E82Y5XzBaa	You don't have to apply the foundation and powder, but it would make it easier to blend your eye shadows and blushes if you did. if you want you could also just apply the powder to blend it, foundation is just to cover red spots and blemishes.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.-)|`|i0UPqaL4aa	I personally think all you need is moisturizer, primer, and concealer. This is the basis for any look. You can create a flawless, fresh-faced look in under 5 minutes with the basics.|`|JReroESmaa	if you wear foundation you should wear powder because it seals the foundation :)<br>  but if you don't you can wear only powder to cover the shine of your skin :)|`|jswDLpJzaa	You don't need to, if you are going for a light natural look (ie; mascara, a swipe of blush & lip balm) you might only need a little concealer dabbed here & there, if that much. But if you are going to apply eyeshadow a bit more blush & color on the lips you need a foundation to help keep things in place (why its called foundation) think of it like a primer that evens out the canvas before you paint on it. so if you are going for a made up look, you definitely need foundation
i0UPqaL4aa	Before you do ANYTHING, I would suggest that you:<br>  <br>  1.  moisturize your face with a lotion. I use Kinerase SPF 30, but Neutrogena works well too. Be very careful around the orbital eye are. People always rub, and it disrupts this sensitive eye area; light dab with your fingertips instead. Kiehl's  makes a great under eye avocado moisturizer that I SWEAR by.<br>  <br>  2. After moisturizing, apply PRIMER. Laura Mercier makes a good primer but you can also try Revlon's clear primer. It's like spackle for your face. It evens out all the bumps and crevices BEFORE you put on your makeup. <br>  <br>  3. Then apply a concealer that is 1 shade lighter than your skin tone to this area as shadows tend to make the area look darker than what it it. <br>  <br>  4. Finally apply your shadow from the socket, along the crease, dabbing, and blending so that it looks even and not too makeup-y.<br>  <br>  There! You're gorgeous dahling!<br>  www.lavishmag.blogspot.com|`|7f21c7e291997b848d2e257c08fe42a6aa	It looks really good on the eye socket. And then some darker powder on the crease. This gives your eye a really pretty and upbeat look. (:|`|n41yoBzFaa	totally the eye socket. If you put it in the crease, it will get clumpy and look really tacky and sloppy.|`|UKBx90hdaa	either or but mostly on the eye socket put a highlighter on the crease|`|AA12084342	eye socket|`|2NwI03Mtaa	both! just wear a great base under and it will look fabulous|`|3d6d798df3efc3fbc6eccc6d6f1eea40aa	you can do both, theres so much you can do with it, just like any other eyeshaow, if you only color up to the crease and use other colors too then chances are it will just give your lid a highlight of the color thats already on there, if you but it on the entire eye socket you can use it as a base for other colors or basically its the same thing as a shade, even though its a cream eyeshadow you should treat it just like any other eyeshadow because basically it is, just made of a different material, i wouldnt recommend as a highlight for your brow because some creme eyeshadows look really caky in a certain light, oily, if you notice that the material is pigmented(very well colored) just right and fine as in smooth, then you should be fine as a highlight but try it and see if you like it and if not just use lotion to wipe it off with a cotton ball or cotton swab that way you wont mess up the makeup you already have on if you put on the highlight on last
AA11125459	Well <br>  1st<br>  I have a pair of ray bans <br>  and the prices weren't as much as they say on the website<br>  I bought a pair of Wayfarers <br>  for $120 off the actual website of Raybans<br>  They do lower the price but they lie to you about how much the original price was. <br>  They might also be used.|`|rUa6UC4Saa	theres a link at the bottom of the site that says "how we manage to price it". click on it for a crappy explanation.<br>  <br>  or it could just be because they carry all the ray-bans that no one wants.

JcJSLAF6aa	To the next interview he goes to put him into a suit.<br>  Wait, hold on, before you ask about the emo/skater-try a black suite, pinstrip with a weird awesome color. Get it doublebrested jacket that the v dips low enough to see an awesome black vest underneath. Let him choose a color of a shirt underneath that he likes, something unqiue , and pair it with an awesome monotone tie. For the pocket, but a skull hankerchief or something.<br>  But mostly, at interviews its also about confidence.<br>  Make sure he doesn't talk skater/emo but more proffessional.<br>  as for the shoes, get them a dull black thats still skater ishh|`|7AxLSwrPaa	You cannot look professional and dress like that. I mean, it's his choice, he can dress however he pleases. But he's not going to impress anyone. He should wear proper, professional looking clothes, and definitely seriously consider removing the piercings. Unless he wants to apply to work someplace like Zumiez or Hot Topic. But even those places have standards.<br>  <br>  He's not going to be taken seriously if he's 20 and dresses like he's 16. Maybe he should grow up.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If he dresses like that, and goes to job interviews, he does not really want a job.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, he would have changed his initial appearance for the interviews. <br>  <br>  But, basic guidelines:<br>  Make sure clothing is clean, well fitting, and pressed / ironed.<br>  Make sure the person wearing them is clean, well scrubbed, and smelling nice.<br>  Do not show (yet) tattoos or piercings - if the company does not have a strict dress-code, you could show them while working there - but not before you are well and truly hired, and through your probation period.<br>  <br>  Then, try to avoid any obvious signs of belonging to a sub-culture (like Emo, Goth, hiphop) because hiring managers usually are somewhat conservative, and would be 'not amused' by such displays.<br>  <br>  Lose the hat/beanie etc.<br>  <br>  Basically, dressing up clearly as a member of a sub-culture and being professional is mutually exclusive.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	i agree with hannah. tell him to take out the snakebites at least. and when you go into a store, dress up. no ones gonna hire someone in dc's and a beater

Very new but I can see it quickly becoming as popular as snakebites.

xZiK3okSaa	Make SURE you wear something conservative to show you are serious about this and grown up. Wear either slacks and a nice shirt or a skirt that reaches past the knees with a matching blazer. NEVER wear jeans,low cut shirts,plain t-shirts,or tennis shoes on an interview of any kind! Try to wear high heels or nice looking shoes. Think formal.|`|X8C9Zwj9aa	Wear a nice outfit that will suit you on what you will be doing.<br>  If it's an interview then go a nice outfit that complements you and what kind of person you are. You should make yourself pleasing to your interviewer. You just don't want yourself to look good but also to feel good.<br>  Visit my source below to see good outfits for you.<br>  Good luck!|`|djNeNEOuaa	You will want to show the interviewer a certain amount of respect, and you do that by dressing up. However, you have to avoid out-dressing your interviewer as well so take a middle of the road approach.<br>  <br>  Wear clothing that is comfortable.  Your clothing should not be too big on you because you don't want to look like you are wearing your parents clothing, you also don't want to wear anything that will be too tight or you'll be squirming during the interview just to adjust it.<br>  <br>  A general suggestion would be:<br>  Sport jacket<br>  Slacks (or pressed khakis) <br>  White button-down shirt<br>  Tie<br>  Black shoes (well polished and clean)<br>  Black socks<br>  <br>  Arrive freshly showered.  <br>  Your hair should be neat and recently cut. <br>  Trimmed fingernails (you will have to shake hands so you'll want to make sure that your hands and fingers are clean.)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your interview!|`|lUNciXaKaa	In my opinion, wearing an outfit that is business casual looks professional enough for a college student. Unless you are interviewing at an ivy league school, than business attire is appropriate. Although, what you do in your off time shouldn't matter, as long as it hasn't or doesn't affect your GPA. The mere fact that you have been called into an interview signifies you qualified in some way, probably academically. Good Luck!|`|g4LOKmngaa	Anything that is business attire or professional looking. The more conservative and respectable you look the better your chances will be.
qUr5P7hgaa	I used to bleach my upper lip until I got old enough to pay for my own lip waxing. No one can see your upper lip hair when it's bleached. You would have to look extra close to notice something like that. If your mom won't buy you facial bleach cream then look in your cabinets for Hydrogen Peroxide. People use hydrogen peroxide to bleach their hair all the time..Most homes have some so apply it and sit and wait....it's worth a try.... How mean of your mom to not let you bleach your mustache! Maybe she secretly wishes you were a boy....JUST KIDDING!<br>  <br>  Good luck..... <br>  oh I wouldn't ever shave your upper lip unless you planned on doing it every day or if it's the VERY LAST  resort ..it WILL come back as stubble every day!|`|ocXOzxFwaa	THOSE LIP BLEACHES END UP LOOKING LIKE WHITE HAIR ON THE TOP OF YOUR LIP, TRUST ME LEAVE IT ALONE, HOWEVER I HAVE USED LEMONS ON THE TOP OF MY LIP, IT SEEMS TO BLEACH THE HAIR, AND THE SUN WILL HELP YOU, AFTER A WHILE IT LOOKED MORE NATURAL TO JUST WAIT FOR THE SUN TO BLEACH IT, AND NEVER USE A RAZOR|`|1KDNlPGdaa	u can get hair removal cream. it doesnt hurt and its easier than waxing or shaving its available at the supermarkets like coles for about $6|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Oh no don't do that.  I used to and its not the way to go.  It just turns the hairs blonde (which YOU can't see but everyone else can because they glow in the sun and are super obvious) and it also bleaches your skin so that you have a mustache shape bleached onto your face.  Wax it, pluck it, or shave it.|`|tANzRJ4daa	Nooo do not do that! Just take the hair off witha creme facial hair rremover like Sally Hansen.

A8FkvRhNaa	Go to a tatoo/piercing parlor and have them take it out....the tragus shouldnt be done like that....Its better to have it done with a hollow needle, and instead of a regular stud you can get a special labret jewelry, which has  flat back to fit comfortably in the ear.|`|aXqtzNIraa	It should never be done with a gun, so it's no surprise it's causing problems, it's also got the wrong kind of jewellery in the piercing.<br>  <br>  This can be easily sorted, go to a piercing shop (ring them up first if you like) and they will change the jewellery for you, there's a wide choice of jewellery you can wear in the tragus and they'll talk you through that. After that it's just healing and cleaning.

PtqN5WM3aa	While I'm not mad on it, I don't hate it either. <br>  <br>  It really depends on how you accessorise it, as to what age group could wear it. I'd love to see it with a pair of yellow, jewelly flats and a yellow cardi on a young girl. With bold, gold accessories and plain flats, an older girl would look great. Shoestrings straps are not the friend of an older lady, as they show WAY too much untoned flesh (unless you are overtoned Madonna, who should start wearing a burkah in my opinion).<br>  <br>  I don't think the cost is offputting, as it's my belief that designer and expensive clothing is about the label and not the quality of a garment. I've picked up clothing all over the world that's been dirt cheap and fabulous and lasted for years. Forever21 seems to be of the same opinion, you CAN have nice stuff in the low to medium range of prices.<br>  <br>  Really, I say screw everyone and wear it if you like it!!|`|U1I2vEM9aa	I think it's very cute!   It's a versitile dress!  I don't think an age should be attached to it.  It can look great on a 20 something  with some strappy sandals or heels, but it is sophisticated enough for a woman in her 30's or 40's with some flat cute sandals and cardigan or shrug!  It is a neutral print that can be dressed up or passed off as a sundress!   <br>  <br>  The good thing about Forever21 is that it IS cheap!  The clothes actually do last, but you will be a lot less anal about spillage or washing it the wrong way because if you mess up a $20 dress it's okay, but a $200 dollar dress....ouch.   If you at least get a couple of wears out of a $22 dollar dress, it's worth it!....but it will last much longer than that!   Very cute dress!|`|8qbp6xWQaa	Age - 30-35<br>  Type of female - Someone who like unique things or has no taste<br>  <br>  Lol Uhm..

But a younger woman might wear it, someone who's into the bohemian sort of style.<br>  <br>  I definitely wouldn't wear it with a yellow sweater, maybe white or blue, but probably grey. Flats would look nice, but I think some strappy heels would add a lot more to the look. And maybe a necklace, but nothing too clunky because it'll just look too busy.<br>  <br>  Forever 21 actually has very well made products. For the price, that is. I've made a number of purchases there and I've never been dissatisfied.
WYa3UY6Gaa	yeah...no image?|`|WLuEIwp5aa	A tattoo artist can change the size.  If you just write it down on a piece of paper and take it in, you can get the artist to clean it up and write it just the way you want it.  Be sure all the lines are right before he makes the stencil, though, you wouldn't want to find out that it's messed up.  And the artist won't be mad if you correct his writing, since you know what it needs to look like, and unless you find a tattoo artist who speaks Korean, they're not going to know what it should be.<br>  <br>  Just take it to the shop and talk to an artist, you should be able to get exactly what you want.  You don't need to have it perfect before you get there.  Good luck!|`|QxSPcQIuaa	Best I could do. <br>  <a href="http://i311.photobucket.com/albums/kk451/P1ayd0h/koreanname.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i311.photobucket.com/albums/kk451...</a>|`|zGOI7Ij5aa	You can probably take it in even in that small form to a tattoo artist and they should be able to enlarge it for you...|`|tX03zk1maa	go to the place u want it done they can enlarge it for you
lfGPmrqdaa	Congratulations re your graduations day.  <br>  My short term answer is make-up,  just book a free make-up session in your nearest department store or Boots, its will cost nothing and they'll give you ideas to hid the scars from all those digital cameras. And you'll get those precious grad pics.<br>  And long term stuff - scars form when a deep layer of tissue is damaged, whether from acne, surgery, injuries, burns, insect bites, or cuts. Here's the 'good news',  healing nows take place but it also takes time ~ 2 years, but the sooner you begin treatment, the more likely you are to heal the scar completely.<br>  The longer a treatment is used the better the results - even on my stretch marks :-).<br>  Vit E and cocoa butter do help loads and can be bought at the Body Shop. But my all time favourite (and most of my friends with kids) is Bio-Oil. Its does what is says on the pot!! In the UK its available in most places that sell skin creams. <br>  PS please remember to remove those price lables from that soles of your new shoes as when you're on stage getting that precious bit of paper those whiter than white lables show up!!!|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Rub Vitamin E oil, every time you shower. Clears up in about three weeks. I even got rid of burn scars, this way!|`|cmJG4V6paa	Scars (by definition) cannot be removed. However, certain treatments from a dermatologist (usually involving types of lasers) can fade them. But they will always be there.|`|IRFbj0G9aa	Depends on how much scar tissue is built up there.  Ultimately use of lasers, dermabrasion, AHA based products and peels all work well, but that requires money and not only.  You have to be extremely responsible there after about sun exposure -  and I am not kidding about that.  A visit to a good dermatologist could point you in the right direction based on your economic capabilities, and the extent of your situation.  And honey don't rush it just cause Graduation day is coming, start something that will be effective and safe, and thank goodness make up has come a long long way in the last few years.  Hook yourself up with some good makeup as well.  Good Luck!|`|i0UPqaL4aa	MOISTURIZE! When you get out of the shower apply olive oil to your skin while it is STILL WET. Then DAB (don't rub) yourself dry. This will get your skin into the mode of being well moisturized. I always use fresh shea butter on my skin. It must be fresh--not the commercial lotions that have a bunch of chemicals in them. Its usually a cream color and it comes in chunks. If it is a specific scar apply pure vitamin E oil to the scar religiously for a few weeks. The scar should start to fade. Make sure you use only pure, natural products, not drugstore items that are enhanced with other chemicals. You will be robbing yourself and wasting your time with those fakes.|`|2B6F5Zhtaa	I'm 16 and my ex used this cream and its a bloody miracle :) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abateit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.abateit.com/</a>|`|FrzCscBlaa	well you could use make up to cover it up temporarily or you could try scar creams.|`|XDYxhuVIaa	CONCEALER/<br>  FOUNDATION|`|a6rHIO5taa	make up, lots of make up

o01QtRwWaa	First, throw out all of your clothes that are too tight, or that don't fit properly. One of the most important things in having a sophisticated wardrobe is to make sure that your clothes fit. Stock up on basics, in nice fabrics, and that are quality. That way, you can mix and match, so you'll have a large variety a clothes. Then, add in some unique pieces.<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  Don't wear too much jewelry. Keep it simple and classy.<br>  Wear beautiful lingerie.<br>  Focus on quality, not quantity.<br>  Don't wear wrinkled clothes. Bring out your iron.|`|GRPxWmBxaa	its important to have 3 things in ur wardrobe without which ur wardrobe wud b incomplete: 1 gud pairs of lingerie is ver imp. Lingeries dat fits well,is very attractive and also sexy colors like dark blue,black,red etc. If u feel confident in da inside it shows on da outside. 2 gud,fitted jeans r vey imp.3 stylish attractive tops and t-shirts r a must. These things u shud definately have in ur wardrobe. U shud always but cloths according to ur body type,not what ur eyes like. Coz wearing sth dat dosen't go wit ur body can b a big fashion blunder.Accesories r also very imp but make sure u amintain a balance[don't wear 2 much] and also footwear matching with every clothing style. U have these stuff and u have a gr8 wardrobe.|`|VfrfVPBYaa	I love ruffle tops with the high waist look!

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist and I work for Mac.<br>  <br>  Mac foundations are created for makeup artists. A lot of their foundations are geared toward photography. Applying foundation incorrectly can leave you with bad results, such as being too cakey and heavy.  The thing about Mac foundations is that YES they are heavy and VERY PIGMENTED. There is a reason...1. Photography and film need heavier foundations, 2. You only need a teeny tiny bit to cover your entire face with a sheer layer. To cover my entire face I only need a pea sized amount of this foundation. Also, taking good care of your skin makes a HUGE difference!<br>  <br>  Oh, and btw...you have COMBO skin....your skin is either oily or dry..if it's both..it's called combination!<br>  <br>  Studio Sculpt has been in the making for 2 years. It's an amazing foundation. It's a gel formula, blends like a dream, and feels so good on the skin. The colors are really off with this foundation, but I hear they are fixing it with the next shipment. I'm normally an NC20 and I ended up getting this in NW15. It is similar to HD foundations. You should apply it with a duo fibre brush (Target's Sonia Kashuk just came out with a dupe..it's hard to find - because it's selling out- but if you find it BUY IT) .<br>  <br>  It's not super for oily skin because it's a satin finish. Studio Fix and Studio Tech are the best foundations for oily skin. I happen to have oily skin and I still use this foundation (with Studio Fix powder to set). I also take good care of my skin and have my oilies under control. Using blot powder helps a lot too. It leaves my skin looking airbrushed, and towards the end of the night it gets slightly "dewy" looking, but nothing too bad.<br>  <br>  It hasn't made me break out. Take care of your skin! Wash your makeup off before bed and in the morning before you put foundation on. Use a toner to get your oil under control. The coverage is medium buildable. I ALWAYS recommend people to get samples of foundation before buying to ensure proper color choice and that it won't break your skin out or make your skin more oily!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|AA12084342	i used to wear it but it felt heavy and i went to a convention for this thing they actually said mac foundation is more like stage make up but love the eyeshadows!!!|`|j4ZbJ6Fwaa	ok i've worn that one b4 and it's really heavy...i too have oily skin and need a bit more coverage because of acne scars from when i was younger. i recommend studio fix liquid if coverage is what you're looking for. it leaves ur face flawless. never never go to sleep with ur makeup on. you shouldnt break out if u clean ur face thoroughly. oh and wash ur brushes everyday. i do it at night b4 i go to bed and their ready to go the next day. also that stuff they sell at mac for brush cleaner is a waste of money. i use shampoo. just make sure u shape the hair back in its place. hope this helps

nV7XBzGAaa	you may need to exfoliate your skin first, as dead skin cells may be built up and blocking the lotion from absorbing into your pores.. just using a loofah is okay. but if you want the best exfoliating/moisturizing experience ever, mix a half cup of coarse brown sugar with a cup of grapeseed oil and rub in circles over all your skin. it will be silky!

FaTW91XHaa	I am a hairstylist and I would only HOPE that you would call me and tell me your worries! Us stylists want to make sure our clients are happy.. You guys are our income! Call her in the morning and explain the situation, maybe she can show you again how to style it, or just make some fine changes to your cut and you will love it. be sure to explain everything you like and dont like. Pictures are AWESOME to take in because a lot of times you may be explaining something and to her she might interpret it way different!!<br>  <br>  As far as your color goes, semi perm. fades.. If you can't handle the color right now, Dish soap works fantastic for stripping color out of hair. You must use more than shampoo and really scrub for at least 5 minutes. Now, it is EXTREMELY important to do a deep conditioning treatment or mask afterwards. The dish soap is going to strip your hair of all nutrients and make it very dry and crispy, which leads to breakage. Although the healthiest way is to just leave it alone and rest assured it WILL fade.. you can always do things later on if it doesn't.<br>  <br>  So, dish soap and heavy conditioner if you can't handle to let it fade naturally.<br>  And, call your stylist TOMORROW<br>  <br>  :) good luck|`|SC5YyhX3aa	tAKE IT TO NEAREST HAIRCUTTER|`|AA11314631	Call your hairdresser first thing tomorrow morning and let her know what's up.  Your hairdresser should "fix" the problem with no additional charge.  If she seems aloof about the whole thing, call back and ask to speak to the manager of the dept.  You shouldn't be stuck worrying about what to do with a bad haircut and bad color.  Even if it wasn't that bad the first 2 days, long-term, that type of haircut shouldn't have been used based on the fact that your hair is thin. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|urdCLZVwaa	who cares it will grow back get over it

To find the largest selection of silk clothing, I suggest that you look online at the following web sites:<br>  <br>  Winter Silks - <a href="http://www.wintersilks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wintersilks.com/</a><br>  <br>  Lovely Silk - <a href="http://www.lovelysilk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lovelysilk.com/</a>
g0xLEJLbaa	Ok this may seem simple.But seriously you should try re-doing your make-up over again!it can be a handful but you face will be different to that of the model so it wont come out exactly the same!From the picture it seems just like a glasses effect!follow the brow line all the way across and finish with a sunglasses kinda effect but smudge alot!make sure to not go to far in with the black eyeshadow as it will make your eyes look smaller!!id put on my powder etc after wards after you have perfected it ^^<br>  <br>  Well i hope that was some help...!|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	i think the eyes r the tricky aprt here...<br>  Get a mask like the one shes wearing n just cut it around they eyes to the size required..Dont take it off,leave it on n try applying the eyeshadw but with a big brush...Now take off the mask n here u go.......  =)<br>  <br>  hope i helped..|`|nV7XBzGAaa	first use allover white powder, or preferably white grease paint (you can get it at a costume store) then for the black use cream eyeliner (or grease paint, again) it goes on with more precision and stays on longer than eyeshadow. also use kohl on the inside rims of your eyes. then red lipstick and you are a go! the finished product might look odd to you, but thats probably just because it is so different from how you normally look. when it comes to other people seeing you they will just see how cool it looks. so don't skimp on it, this look needs to be all or nothing! :)|`|ksZfTHyQaa	Try using a primer under your eyeshadow, that will intensify the color and make it last longer without creasing. You can use urban decay's primer potion or for a darker look try using MAC's Blackground paint pot as a primer. If you need a good black eyeshadow try MAC's Carbon eyeshadow. But, I definitely suggest you check out Ben Nye's products. You can try finding them in theatrical shops or by searching online. They're the best when it comes to theater make up.|`|gDxrdyNqaa	you could go to a salon and see if they can do this for you. most salons should do this.<br>  <br>  if not then maybe you could make a mask type shape round your eyes use a little black eyeshadow and blend very well around the area. it helps me whne doing something like this.

Unless you don't like it there.<br>  <br>  If I had one on my nose or the one of my cheek got too big or changed . . . yeah, I'd have it removed in a heartbeat. There's always a little plastic surgery to cover a scar.|`|b9cQN3FCaa	I have one at the top of my cheek, under my right eye and always get compliments on it!

There is no real beaver peeker mini skirt if you want to be honestly visual about it. No matter how short the mini skirt is, unless you're a Superman with x-ray vision you can't see through the panties under the skirt.<br>  <br>  We need to tell Uncle Wayne to get with the modern times and design a full line of women's under garments that highlight the camel toe. Then you buy your wife such a garment for her birthday along with the traditional mini skirt. I think your wife would feel flattered beyond joy that you would think that she still has 'it to flaunt.'|`|zQyslfHKaa	I believe she will be romanced beyond words, however I am intrigued at how you intend on obtaining the skirt from Uncle Wayne?  I am assured that Uncle Wayne is not only quite fond of beaver peeking (being a huge fan of zoology) but of that skirt, so how on earth are you going to distract him long enough to abscond with said gift?|`|AA10847209	Only if you're married to a logger.|`|5s68Zbddaa	How thoughtful of you darling.

At Camp Leakey, the orangutans are gradually acclimatised to the jungle, and as they get closer to complete independence, they are able to come and go as they please. While walking through the camp with Galdikas, my informant was suddenly seized by a large male orangutan, his intentions made obvious by his erect penis. Fighting off so powerful an animal was not an option, but Galdikas called to her companion not to be concerned, because the orangutan would not harm her, and adding, as further reassurance, that "they have a very small penis." As it happened, the orangutan lost interest before penetration took place, but the aspect of the story that struck me most forcefully was that in the eyes of someone who has lived much of her life with orangutans, to be seen by one of them as an object of sexual interest is not a cause for shock or horror. The potential violence of the orangutan's come-on may have been disturbing, but the fact that it was an orangutan making the advances was not. That may be because Galdikas understands very well that we are animals, indeed more specifically, we are great apes. This does not make sex across the species barrier normal, or natural, whatever those much-misused words may mean, but it does imply that it ceases to be an offence to our status and dignity as human beings."<br>  <br>  Peter Singer, "Heavy Petting", nerve.com, 2001
zZ9UbXJwaa	I have a tattoo on each foot - quite large pieces on the top. My first tattoo was also on my lower back. I didn't find it too painful and was surprised by the amount of people that said it would be agony because of all the little bones. <br>  <br>  I conversed with my artist all the way throughout, laughing and joking and even discussing politics of the day! Each piece took just over an hour, there were some moments when I thought "Ouch!" but this only lasted a few seconds and I was fine. My artist told me I took it like a trooper - maybe I have a high pain threshold but let's put it this way, I got my right foot tattooed and 2 months later was sat in the chair getting my left foot done... :)|`|2UDbOpxTaa	It's true that tattoos close to the bone are generally more painful, so ankles, wrists, collar bones, etc can sting a bit. However your tattoo sounds quite small so it'll be over quickly. Ankles are quite a common place for people to get tattoos so it can't be that bad. Good luck :)|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	get a tattoo on your ankle!, its much better(even though it hurt more than on the foot)...|`|o9p5kn1Baa	my sister got her first one a small tattoo on her hip and laughed because there was no pain, but then got her second on her foot, and said it hurt like hell because of all the little bones. and her foot swelled up pretty fat and she couldnt walk very well for a couple days|`|EkITdsnkaa	i've got a flower and two butterflies on my foot, and it hurt. where ever there's bone its going to hurt.|`|gXypLAyiaa	Ankle/foot tattoos can look cool.|`|mskwl4zMaa	The foot can be different depending on where you get it. The top of the foot is the easiest as far as the foot goes. You will feel with the artist goes over the tendons but it's not unbearable. The hardest part is keeping your leg still because there are many nerve endings that will make you jump a little. If you are worried about pain just stay away from your toes and the bottom. When I say bottom I mean the side bottom also. I have tattoos all over my feet and the only tattoo I have gotten yet that made me wanna scream was the on right on the side of my foot under my ankle. If you just stay away from the ankle bone itself you will be fine. It will probably even be less painful then you would think. Just staying calm and not psyching yourself up is the easiest way to make a tattoo go swimmingly.|`|dioPrRFjaa	I am the biggest wimp in the world and i was really worried about the pain of getting one dont on my foot but it actually didnt hurt.

2SDKgjJ7aa	Hey there!!<br>  I can totally understand and sympathize since I have gone through the same exact thing! And I was dating/engaged and getting pretty worried about clearing it up when I came across some awesome tips that have pretty much gotten my legs under control!<br>  First, you should take a bit of a break from saving. I used an electric razor for about a month or so usually every other day. I could not get a close shave with it though so eventually I went back to shaving with a razor again. When I went back I tried some new things that made all the difference!<br>  When you shave, take your time and don't press real hard or go super fast. When I hurry I usually end up with a little rash. Do your legs VERY LAST in your shower. I would shave earlier in my shower and by the end of my shower my legs would be burning, red,hurting and rashed horrible! But when I shave at the end of my shower, get out as soon as I'm done and get them dried off ASAP they seem to do really well!!<br>  As far as the bikini line, that continues to be a struggle, but there is an amazing product that you can use for that! I had forgotten about it and my bikini line was a mess and hurt so bad I could barely even walk, but I just picked some up from Walmart and shaved yesterday with it and still today not a single bump!!! You can get it from Walmart and its super cheap... only $3-4! It's called Bikini Zone Anti-bumps Shave Gel! I have no idea what is in it, but it sure works! You shouldn't shave there everyday probably though. <br>  Try this and let me know how it works! =) I hope you can have as good success as I have had - hott sexy legs!!|`|RH4PM3fEaa	i suggest that you keep using the conditioner if it works. or even try just a body lotion. shave less often or get some wax or wax strips and just  try it on a little section and see if it works :) hope this helps if not, go see a dermatologist or your doctor and see what can be done. :) or you coukd try a different razor, one with a moisture strip or even an epilator(like an electric razor) <br>  hope this helps|`|BVkQzUBZaa	1) Keep using conditioner its great! ( I love shaving foam for women but obvs dont use it if it makes it worse for you )<br>  <br>  2) Dont shave everysingle day..leave it at least 3 days untill you shave again as this is what causes bumbs and bleeding. <br>  <br>  3) you can buy wax strips which are reasonable price from Boots which are very good. <br>  <br>  Look on the website below its great! x
Pp7ThhNmaa	You can get temporary color the washes out at Walmart, or bright colors at Hottopic, and hottopic has a website so just google them. You can probably get some at spencers (google search for website).|`|GRPxWmBxaa	u can use color sprays dat r gud 4 temporary hair color.|`|NHvYiT27aa	buy color extensions and cut them if  u need to and just clip them in or buy spray in colour for your hair, the type people usually have in their hair at football games easy..dont use mascara that will get gross in your hair

6YwLlYovaa	for brushes that you use with different products (like eye brushes that you use with different colors) it's a good idea to wash them after you use them to avoid the products mixing together. but with face brushes that you use with the same product every day i find deep cleaning every night a bit time consuming and pointless.<br>  i recommend only deep cleaning your face brushes like once a week (deep cleaning as in washing with water and baby shampoo or brush cleanser and then leaving them overnight to dry.)<br>  but it's still a good idea to have like some antibacterial wipes near your brushes so you can just give them a quick clean after you use them to ensure that the product does not build up in the brush, and to remove any nasty bacteria.|`|GnT2CnhBaa	you should atleast wash your make up brushes every two weeks, you should also use clean eyeshadow brushes. so its probably handy to have a few of those. <br>  if you dont have a make up brush cleanser, just use a little bit of shampoo, wet your brush and work it through the bristles, then rinse out the shampoo or cleanser making sure its all out, reshape the brush and then let it dry. i break out alot to if i dont wash my brushes.|`|32739bf251ecc5a809d7cee0e1237afcaa	It's personal preference really!<br>  <br>  I wipe mine on a baby wipe after every use which removes the majority of the makeup that is on the brush from the product I just used and then once a week I clean them all in a mix of very warm water and baby shampoo.<br>  <br>  If you breakout a lot then make sure you do thoroughly clean your face brushes.<br>  <br>  There is no need for a vigorous wash after every use - do that and even the best brushes will start to wear out.<br>  <br>  Finally - if you have wooden handled brushes make sure you don't leave them to soak in water.  The water seeps up through the brush and over time the wood will rot and the brush will gradually fall apart.<br>  <br>  Hope all this info helps!|`|SuvinbcWaa	I Always do this<br>  <br>  get a cloth and wet it but dont!!!!use to mutch water or itll take adgers for ur brush to dry<br>  onli wet it a lil and ull notice all the dirt,makeup or wht evar is on ur brush that u want wiping of is coming of<br>  <br>  u cud get a teatowel<br>  babywipe<br>  cloth<br>  or if u have makeup wipes use them<br>  it always works for me<br>  <br>  hope i helped=-]|`|zA98589Baa	It's best to wash them everytime you use them.
j3Gs9wkeaa	Coons?!  Momma used to just brush em off the porch with a broom
YnEKOJayaa	okay i used ot do this to my hair, this is what you need to do.  <br>  first you will need to get some bleach and bleach the desired strip.  then you need to get like some tape or something and tape over the parts that you do not want dyed.  then over the uncovered pieces of hair you color it the desired color.  <br>  then wait however long you are supposed to wait, and rinse it out with COLD water, NOT HOTT OR WARM!  you will want cold so that the color doesnt bleed into the part where it will be blonde.<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  :)|`|NyeUGGWRaa	you need to bleach it then paint the stripes across using a black hair dye i did it for my friend a while  back

zA98589Baa	Why don't you go to www.covergirl.com and get colormatched? It's totally free and here's the best part, you will be asked to state your hair color, eye color and skin tone. The website will then automatically choose products and shades that will flatter your complexion. Cool, huh? <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Flj3Xy47aa	everything would look pretty on you|`|ZrS4I4lNaa	I would probably go for golds but i guess it depends on the occasion?|`|fqcipoFDaa	do you like orange, pink or blue it might be good to you|`|J2IQiBgQaa	try black eyeliner and mascara, dont use blush unless if its very natural looking, for lip gloss just use a tiny bit, and use clear lip gloss.<br>  purple eyeshadow goes well with brown eyes.<br>  gold eyeshadow will go well with your tanned skin.<br>  .. i dunno, just see which colour best compliments your outfit :)

zNmJ46kmaa	as you said u met him quite a lot of times and u're being friendly with him, so i think if the person is understanding , you shoul go on and tell him the truth!!<br>  there's no harm instead u might get a steady advice from him!! maybe!<br>  <br>  calm down it happens sometimes..<br>  <br>  another tip::: stop the use of straightners! nothing can be more harmful than burning your hair ;literallly!|`|gsXCsPhwaa	I think you should tell him about this situation the next time you see him. The longer you keep your wig a secret, the worse it's gonna be. (It will be really bad if you didn't tell him and he somehow found out!)<br>  Just let him know that your hair is damaged and that time will fix this problem.|`|OXMP3o6Eaa	If you're concerned about the state of your hair. You should probably spend time working to improve the condition with biotin vitamins, weekly hot oil treatments, and protein treatments. Another suggestion is perhaps investing natural hair care product designed for black/mixed raced women. Although your hair may be damaged from heat (and depending on the degree of damage, may have to do the "big chop") you can always invest in a good moisturizer to do a beautiful "braid out" and accentuate waves in your hair. This way the "frizzy bob" will be moisturized, soft, shiny  and wavy hair instead. The Mineral Indulgence product line has a Kiwi Coconut Hair Smoothie that I am particularly fond of, and am able to do a beautiful braid out with. If you don't know how to do a braid out feel free to email me, as I wold be happy to help you out. <br>  <br>  As for the wig situation, I don't think you have much to worry about. If this is guy is of good value and likes you beyond you aethetic apearance than you wearing a wig should not even phase him. If it DOES in fact bother him, than that just lets you know up front who her really was. Also, wigs are not uncommon amongst whites, nor are weaves and exstensions. Many white women wear wigs for various reasons..they are commonplace. <br>  <br>  You should not tell him anything that you are not comfortable with telling him. To be quite honest, at this point, what goes on with your har is no ones business but your own and you owe him no explanation. If you do decide to tell him, I would approach it in a somewhat humorous manner. Just so the moment wont be so awkward. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mineralindulgence.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mineralindulgence.com/</a>
rJDMygzYaa	as you say that u r tall and thin then must go for bell bottoms they look very good on thin & tall people.And u also said that you wear jeans and tops so you can wear a long top on a legging and wear a belt on the waist of yours on the top that will make u look smarter.And you can also go for shirts and zippers which look very smart on thin and tall people and after wearing the shirt just fold the sleeves till it reaches to your elbow. ok. thanks|`|fxwKFJefaa	make the most of an awesome body! you can wear whatever you want!<br>  id say skinny jeans, probably steer clear of heels if you dont want to look too tall, a slightly baggy top to balance you out, or a top with details on it. you could also wear 'boyfriend jeans' which are slightly baggy rolled up at the bottom with a plain t shirt.|`|eVk8yPy2aa	A top that isn't too fitted as it will emphasise how thin you are and jeans that flare out a bit at the bottom to shorten your body a bit.|`|mY0sSIQDaa	I'm no stylist, but my friend is exactly the same as you and she wears Skinny jeans, Tulip and peplum skirts, Oversized tops as dresses etc and it looks good on her, Basically you can wear anything that models are wearing as they have the same body shape as you.|`|BRlWdRl9aa	you can wear skin tight jeans and any kind of tight shirt <br>  which will be a gr8 advantage of ur figure ,or u can wear a knee lenght skirt with a cute top

Try to ask them about the "color light". It may help to decrease the mark. After that, you have to apple UV sun block to prevent it get worst. Don't use cider vinegar, because your skin is thick and maybe hurt, thus, easily have brown spots n freckles. It is too strong for your skin. Maybe SKII spot pad, lancome UV/SPF can help.

The best colors (depending on which color in your eye you want to stand out the most) are: <br>  <br>  Grays/silvers for the green/gold tones in your eyes with a light silver or light gray under the brow. <br>  <br>  Violets/browns for the brown flecks with a very light purplish pink under the brow. <br>  <br>  Or light & dark shades of matte browns with a light cream color under the brow.

mzLMkdbQaa	Around 2-4 months. You blew out your ear. Waiting 2 weeks to go to the next size wasn't a smart idea. I would downsize on your left ear also.

F32uPjAraa	Freckles are sexy, keep an eye on the moles. If they begin to itch or change colour, or shape, then you should get them looked at. Otherwise they should be right.|`|812eeffde93b6c9b94520e95821a80a2aa	Freckles are ok. Only worry about new moles particularly if they are rough and/or itchy. Doctors recommend that if you notice anything you are not sure about then they are happy to check it out and put your mind at rest.<br>  <br>  PS I forgot to say that I find freckles extremely attractive (its why I've been married for 30 years) so don't think about having them removed|`|rSautofoaa	Yes, you should definitely have them checked at least once a year. More often if you notice them changing in anyway (growing, becoming irritated, darkening in color). Some signs of abnormal 'freckles' is anything very dark, nearly black in color, and things with abnormal borders, meaning not circular, but in odd shapes. However, even things that don't match this description could be cause for concern, especially if they begin to grow, changes colors, etc. The safest thing you can do is schedule an appointment with a dermatologist and have a thorough check up, and let him/her recommend how frequently you should have check ups. Best of luck.|`|4BqZ8ps0aa	Some moles are cancerous, but it is rare.  You can have moles removed and freckles can be removed as well thanks to breakthroughs in laser technology.|`|LSBHfhuaaa	if you are concerned get them checked first, then after monitor them and if they change in any way get them checked asap to make sure that they aren't turning cancerous.|`|4Um6yfhdaa	Consult your doctor. Don't get rid of them unless it's for a medical reason. Trust me, I know.|`|mzLMkdbQaa	Any change in color/size/darkness of the mole..not so sure about freckles. Although if you have freckles/sun spots/burn easily that highly increases your dangers to sun exposure on your moles. It would be very smart to get any moles checked out as soon as possible, schedule an appointment with a dermatologist, it is worth your time.

Use a bit of concealar and also powder matching with ur skin color. dat shud do da trick.
YdI1SSyKaa	For you my best suggestion is that you invest in a hot flat iron, and a light leave in like Infusium 23, and flat iron going slowly in small sections, & dont do it more too often, twice a week is the most i suggest if you dont want to fry your hair!!<br>     Black hair is usually not only straightened with a flat iron but with something called a hot comb as well. Its called getting your hair "pressed". You can buy a metal comb that is heated in an "oven" (not the one you cook with) or on the burner of your kitchen stove. It is best to have this done by a professionally because getting it the right temperature and using the right technique takes skill that is learned over time & it is highly likely that u will burn yourself and your hair out. Pressing is done alone but to get that bone straight hair it is usually flat ironed as well. You can also perm your hair but i find that not only does this affect hair growth over time but the texture is not the same as if you were to press/flat iron yourself. Doing this does not permanently straighten hair, you will need to rewash & redo it every one or two weeks. The average price for this in salons is $45 or more, every 2 weeks! Yes, black women dedicate alot of time, effort and money in their hair...be grateful that most of you can just wash and go LoL.|`|GRPxWmBxaa	straightners.

0WASp0bHaa	No don't put hair spray on your face!<br>  <br>  A primer will help. I use Prime Time. You put it on before your make up. Using a translucent powder will help seal your make up on too. Using a good brand of make up makes a difference too. Especially in your eye shadow, cheap eye shadow will crease and wear off. <br>  <br>  Lip stick will wear off unless you use a "all day" <br>  <br>  like:<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=outlast_smoothwear_lipcolor" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <br>  If you are a teen and your face gets oily you will have trouble with your make up staying on all day.|`|ZQaoylZMaa	Well...try choosing make-up that doesn't melt away easily. and dont wear too much of it in the summer...|`|GO43F0mwaa	Buy a primer and put it on before your make-up.  I use Vitamin C Skin Boost by the Body Shop before putting on my moisturiser and it makes my skin look alot brighter, helps my make-up match in better with my natural skin colour and it helps my make-up last.<br>  <br>  If you've got kinda oily skin though, I'd go and speak to someone at The Body Shop first before using it cause it can make my skin abit oily by the end of the night.|`|gDxrdyNqaa	you can buy a spray that can help stop this. you spray on before your make up. i do not know what it is called but you could always ask in shops like boots or debinhams|`|7REKQKmoaa	Get some translucent powder.

uscHnFPtaa	try these simple cosmetics.. theyre easy to apply.<br>  <br>  True blend minerals, for blush/glitter and bronzer<br>  <br>  "Maybeline" dream matte mousse for base<br>  <br>  some simple basic eye shadow colors. (pink, blue, purple, white, black, brown) <br>  <br>  eyelash curler<br>  <br>  exact highlights mascara (get your eye color)<br>  <br>  Flat eye brush<br>  <br>  First put on your base, make sure to always rub it in upwards. then apply some light pink under your brows. Then starting from the inside corner of your eye apply thin line twords end corner with the flat brush and black shadow. lightly go over it with black/eggplant eyeliner. and end corner of you eye pull it upward so it has that curve to make your eyes more catty, then take your eyelash curler and pump it three times then apply your mascara last.. you may not quite get it at first but you will catch on.. dont be afraid to play with your makeup and try different styles.. everyone has their own look you just gotta find it :) I hope I helped some|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Go to www.youtube.com, there you will find lots and lots of make-up tutorials.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|J2IQiBgQaa	well it depends how old you are.. <br>  if your say 12-15years, which im guessing you are seeing as you said your a beginner?<br>  I would suggest start off simple, truly people always look better with less makeup. You will just end up looking fake and terrible if you wear too much. <br>  Maybe start off with a clear or black mascara, then you can use foundation.. make sure to test it out on the top of your hand before buying it, to make sure it suits your skin tone. uum if you want to go for a more intense look you could try dark brown or black eyeliner. <br>  I wouldn't suggest using eyeshadow unless if its a special occasion, or something.<br>  But if you really want to.. <br>  purple and blue go with brown eyes.<br>  gold will look good on tanned people.<br>  maybe silver if you have blue eyes..|`|zA98589Baa	Go to youtube and search for beginner's makeup. There'll be plenty of tutorials for you to watch. <br>  <br>  As a beginner, I'd say try some mascara and lip gloss. If you have good skin, use some tinted moisturizer. If you have acne, try using a concealer first. Since you're a beginner, I wouldn't recommend lipstick and eyeliner because it's very easy to mess up these two. Only use foundation when you've mastered blending it properly so it looks natural. <br>  <br>  Maybelline's mascaras are quite good for a drugstore brand. Try Great Lash. Make sure you buy the waterproof version so it doesn't smudge.You can also use a blusher if you want to look more glowy.<br>  <br>  As you're a beginner, I suggest trying drugstore brands first so at least you wouldn't waste so much money in case it doesn't work out for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|5RjHESqyaa	hey hon! i'll list the basic steps of make up application<br>  <br>  cleanse your face, tone it, moisturize (very important step. moisturizes your face and gives your make up something to STICK TO if you have oily skin), apply a primer (A VERY WISE INVESTMENT. i'll suggest some brands to you later. main purpose of a primer is to act as a base and give you a much more professional finish as well as much longer lasting effects. but only apply primer 10-15 mins AFTER the moisturizing stage! this is to ensure you allow enough time for the moisture to set in first.), followed by foundation, concealer, blush, loose powder (to set your make up and give it a matte finish as well).<br>  <br>  i use regular drugstore brand face wash and toner like Dove and Nivea. works fine for me. i use MAC studio moisture fix (moisturizer) it's not bad but you can definitely find even better moisturizers out there that probably don't cost as much.<br>  <br>  as for the primer, i use MAC Prep + Prime. IT'S AMAZING. TRUST ME. pricey but a very wise investment. there's the MAC Prep + Prime and MAC Prep + Prime SPF 50 (this one has sun protection). not much difference to me but the former does feel a little lighter on my skin than the latter. but honestly, both work just fine. i'm not sure if price is an issue with you though! if it is you can try regular drugstore brands like Revlon's face primer. it's works well too! or Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer. this is a good recommendation. voted the best primer by many!<br>  <br>  as for foundation, i use MAC Studio Fix Liquid Foundation. I LOVE IT! great coverage and long lasting results when paired with Prep + Prime especially. however MAC is known to cause break outs so you might wanna take note.. a cheaper alternative that provides great coverage still would be Revlon Colorstay Liquid Foundation. much cheaper but still great!!<br>  <br>  a very important but DUH tip i'd have to tell you is you abbbbbsolutely have to remove your make up properly with a good make up remover. this is to ensure your skin is kept healthy in the long run!<br>  <br>  if you need help with what brushes or applicators to get, feel free to ask;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helped hun!<br>  goodluck with your make up<br>  <br>  xx|`|5ci9IZd2aa	I say find a woman in your family Mom, aunt, friend, etc someone who appears to have knowledge of makeup, and have them give you a couple hand- on demonstrations.

I know you don't want these.  If you want some that are more realistic, you're going to have to pay more for them.  I live in Los Angeles and you can find the more expensive ones in the garment district downtown.  You can also find them on like Canal Street in NYC.  See the link below for a more expensive pair:|`|unFeMeYXaa	All of them are going to look pretty fake to be honest.

bRYoI2Mqaa	Fashion is mainly set by the people. It is what majority of the people wear. Something which all would like, that's what is fashion. But if you really have attitude and confidence, you can make what is 'out' according to people, 'in'.|`|yyn6ES94aa	generally what gets highlighted in media and people(mainly stylish people or page3 people).<br>  but for fashion one should follow oneself not others
vZ4NXlBmaa	1 - "tattoo".....everybody should know how to spell it before getting one.  And everybody should be old/mature enough to not use e-speak like "cuz"<br>  2 - I hope your parents/guardians punish you accordingly for doing something that stupid/immature/irresponsible<br>  3 - you almost certainly will live<br>  infection isn't "likely" but I wouldn't be surprised if it happend.....as you have absolutely no idea how to actually "sterilze" a needle<br>  4 - the tattoo does not look good...honestly....it's poorly done and makes you look like some 15 year old who got a generic/overdone tattoo on a street corner....just to look "cool"|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Well firstly - what do you mean by a sterilised needle? A lot of people seem to be under the impression that burning/boiling/dipping in alcohol effectively sterilises equipment, but this is not the case. Reputable tattoo studios use autoclaves, which are the same things used in hospitals, and the only thing that will kill blood borne pathogens, ie HIV, Hepatitis, MRSA, etc. Burning etc a needle gives no protection from that, and those infections are rife amongst people who get home tattoos.<br>  <br>  Even so, it's fairly unlikely that you will have contracted anything like that, a lot of kids do this and the worst they get is an infection which doesn't kill them, just hurts and leaves an unsightly mess behind. But it's not impossible, it would be irresponsible of me to say it is.<br>  <br>  Keep the area clean and treat it like you would any other open wound to prevent infection. But my advice would be to go and see your doctor with these concerns, who may agree to test you later down the line for blood borne viruses. And if you do develop an infection in the area - as I said this won't kill you, people even sometimes get infections from proper tattoos, but your doctor should prescribe you some cream or antibiotics in that scenario to clear it up.<br>  <br>  And needless to say, please learn your lesson from this and don't do anything so silly again, your health is precious and you should value it.|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	There is nothing good about homemade tatts. ALMOST as bad as the homemade ones that go down in the pen.
522aa65c1b34eb11b3f2d49055c80a7aaa	Cotton is pretty durable, but it also depends on how thick the fabric is too. In my experience cotton is iron and tumble dry safe as in it won't catch on fire or scorch, but if the dryer s really hot it might shrink. As for being fire safe I would say no some fabrics are treated to not burn but I'm going to assume and say that its not treated. Hopefully that helps you. :) Good Luck!!
vZ4NXlBmaa	1 - Caps Lock is pointless and annoying<br>  <br>  2 - the Search Bar works well......use it<br>  <br>  3 - no<br>  <br>  <br>  big surprise somebody in violation of numbers 1&2 needs a tattoo removed...|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay, first off there is no need to type in capitals, it's very off-putting and I just feel like you're shouting at me.<br>  <br>  I haven't used it, but I can tell you: Wrecking Balm is not tattoo removal. It works to fade a tattoo slightly to make it easier to cover over with a new tattoo. That being said, I have spoken to people who've used it with no results whatsoever. But I also know people who have had lots of sessions of laser treatment without any results whatsoever. But those who do have some result from Wrecking Balm do not experience a removal of their tattoo. As I said, just a lightening of the area. So unless you intend to get it covered over with a new design, this would just make it look worse than it already does. If it removed tattoos, people would not still be spending thousands on laser treatment. Tattoos really are permanent, I'm afraid. Even with laser, if you have successful results, you'll still see a mark where it was thousands of pounds later. The best and most realistic option for getting rid of a tattoo you don't like is having it covered with another, but depending on the tattoo you have, even this may not be possible.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	a tattoo is permanent, save your money|`|o3xvqEkAaa	Never heard of it but i'm 99.9% sure it won't work

CSkd41ELaa	i like my hair to be healthy and shiny...... so i never use anything bad on or in it..............<br>  <br>  never blow dry it always air dry, never straighten or curl, never been dyed, never been highlighted, NOTHING........ and i always either use pantene shampoo and conditioner or i use garnier fructise|`|DSVUvfGuaa	I see you ask a lot about how to look nice and healthy... loool. Some thing new for a change...Did you fall in love ? loool|`|xtowjUbpaa	I use henna, it protects them and they look great ~|`|HvX6KvK1aa	i always keep my hair pulled back in a ponytail|`|X6T0qwqEaa	putting your hair up breaks it but leaving it down makes it easier to get nits and dirty hair so its a loose loose.<br>  <br>  To propperly start taking care of your hair you need to start off with healthy hair. I had long but extremely unhealthy hair so i cut it all off into a pixie cut to start fresh and grow it back out. It can be a shock but your hair will grow back, mine is so healthy, it feels like silk. Minimise  use of hair products and how much you brush your hair. dont dye it and make sure you get it trimmed regularly as once you have split ends you cant fix them. Use hydrating shampoo and conditioners<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and one more thing- Direct heat is a no no! so that means no more flat iron straightners and hair dryers|`|zkovxRseaa	with crazy glue and paper weights|`|uuK5lYsjaa	High quality hair products and a flat iron.
X6T0qwqEaa	I window shop or browse markets to see something that i like. I like basic fitted clothes but i love to spice it up with accessories, shoes and bags so my style is pretty eclectic. I also get inspiration from other peices i see people wearing when im out and about. I love getting style tips from my favourite shows too, Gossip Girl is a good one for fashion|`|319vJyXoaa	My fashion guide? Magazines (seventeen, vogue, self, mags. like those) and whatever the hottest deisgners put down the runway.  You can see what they all have in common, and match it in a toned down way.

Ztdw7nrLaa	I would have liked it better if you would remove the brittney pic!!<br>  But it doesn't really look that depressing. It kinda looks more goth (cause of the colors, I guess) than anything...<br>  I think if it has to be depressing, it's more like you don't even care what you wear and you don't "match" stuff if you know what I mean..<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~|`|Lfn2LOTzaa	I don't think so. I think it just would make ppl. think you are a Brittney Spears fan and you liked that CD, to be honest.<br>  But in my opinion dressing to express "your mood" seems like it will only remind and keep you in that mood. Do you want that?<br>  I am not missing your point, though. I just feel it is counter-productive to purposely perpetuate that depressed feeling you may feel sometimes.<br>  <br>  I hope things work out between you two; I do, you seem sweet, but you should be with someone who doesn't make you feel sad, ya know?<br>  <br>  But in regard to your question; I would suggest a more "generic" outfit that gets across the mood without any other attachments to it if you genuinely feel like doing that. Like something that has a picture kind of like that but no names or advertisements of any kind on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Flj3Xy47aa	your style is really creative i think you should go on a designer job wow i'm really impressed and you know about your fiance don't put your head down it passed and you know and he knows that he really loves you|`|A0FjxXyDaa	i don't really get it but dressing like britney spears wont make you look depressed it'll make you look skanky. find your own style and feel better on the inside first, it's the best way to get over ur bastard of an ex|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I think that it is fitting and you are very creative and dump his a$$ you can do better girlie.|`|6IiRK1rvaa	i don't thing so we can do like that|`|NdaU2BMXaa	?

If so then yea theres hope, usually girls start getting bigger breasts when they start having their periods.

VHnVBZhVaa	That doesn't really make sense.  Unless your lip gloss is getting on your chin it wouldn't have any effect.  If your breakouts are localized to your chin it is more likely caused by resting your chin in your hand while sitting or from your phone.

E’ però possibile accelerarne la guarigione con preparati appositi (aciclovir, come lo Zovirax), molto efficaci anche su lesioni già manifeste, che inibiscono in modo mirato la moltiplicazione dei virus dell’Herpes.<br>  Due nuovi farmaci alternativi all'aciclovir arricchiscono lo strumentario disponibile contro herpes labiale, genitale e zoster. Il penciclovir ha dimostrato un buon effetto sulla riduzione dei tempi di guarigione e sulla recidiva dell'infezione labiale, mentre il valaciclovir è per ora sovrapponibile all'aciclovir nelle altre forme erpetiche.<br>  Ti consiglio di consultare il sito <a href="http://www.occhioclinico.it/occhio/farrec/0299far.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.occhioclinico.it/occhio/farre...</a><br>  Lo Zovirax in pomata in genere è sufficiente e lo metti sopra l'herpes stesso. In genere l'herpes labiale scompare massimo in una settimana, ma poi varia da caso a caso.<br>  Un suggerimento utile potrebbe essere di mettere sull'herpes un cubetto di ghiaccio per ridurre il fastidio oppure, aiutandosi con un piccolo tampone di cotone, applicare sulle vescicole alcool per un paio di minuti, 4 volte al giorno, in modo da asciugarle.(<a href="http://www.saninforma.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=5788&idSezioneRif=758)" rel="nofollow">http://www.saninforma.it/Sezione.jsp?idS...</a><br>  Ultimamente si sono resi disponibili in farmacia preparati omeopatici a base di sostanze naturali che favorirebbero la cicatrizzazione delle lesioni erpetiche (es.

Di questi preparati tuttavia non è mai stata testata l'efficacia in studi clinici. <br>  Alcuni indicano come efficace la melissa in pomata.<br>  Quando le croste scompaiono è consigliato applicare una crema disinfettante o una crema a base di lysosome più volte al giorno.<br>  Ciao!

JcuVOcyjaa	I'm not sure how you curl it, but try curling it in smaller sections instead of big chunks. and finger comb it after. Sometimes i use an afro pick or a very wide toothed comb to only comb through my roots and apply a small amount of very, very light hold hair spray to roots. That creates a lift and makes your hair  appear a little thicker all over. Do you us a hair grease? Opt for a light oil instead. Grease can weigh your hair down, but with oil you will get more of a light silky feel plus less damage from heat styling since you don't have a petroleum base in an oil. I hope this helps!|`|6uYVRaebaa	um...you can try leaving in conditioner and blow drying it upside down?

1IJp17Eeaa	If you moisturise every day, the follicles are easier to remove with the hair making it less painful. Also, avoid going to get it done around when your period is due. Make sure you're well into your cycle, and I swear it won't hurt half as much. Make sure you get it done professionally the first time so you know that it's done right, after that it gets easier and knowing that you're in control of it, it doesn't hurt as much.|`|ZMWjdKfraa	Well I think its really painful and only had it done once , now I shave or use cream|`|HUrYSp4oaa	it will be painful first time,but the results will be worth it and the more u get used to it the less it will hurt. u can take some ibuprofen or paracetamol an hour or so before u go to help ease the discomfort a bit. good luck.|`|hviykDAraa	it doesnt hurt!!<br>  <br>  I wax now and the first time i did it i was dreading it but i actually like doing it now, theres a little discomfort but its over in a second!!

Ouch!|`|7XMyY4pLaa	A bikini wax wouldn't be painful at all. I get a brazilian wax and that hurts.. around about a 6 on a scale. A bikini is only the sides so it would be easy to get done.<br>  <br>  Have a warm shower before you get it done so that you are clean and the warm relaxes the skin so it is easier to wax out. Also if you can get the waxing done a week after your period is it meant to be not as painful for some reason. Your not as tense or something in that area (i'm not 100% sure) It is not like tweezing 1 hair and multiplying it.. Its a quick sting but then it is fine. After you will be sensitive but its worth every $ and the pain is bearable.|`|GU1i931Xaa	It depends on how sensitive your skin is. I had one once and it bruised me, as in really painful black bruising. It definitely hurts more than having your legs waxed, say, or your eyebrows. It's a really sensitive area.<br>  <br>  But that's not to say it would bruise you. Although I find that Veet cream works just as well and that doesn't hurt in the slightest.|`|F1igZsMXaa	pluck one of your pubes with a pair of tweezers. then multiply the pain from that by the number of pubes you have.|`|cox2tS6laa	It hurts a good bit and there is some redness afterwards but it lasts a bit longer than shaving|`|5Fwuya29aa	it doesn't hurt that much.  cause it's quick.<br>  <br>  just do it QUICKLY. it'll be ok.

Lie on the floor and place hands on the floor or behind the head.<br>  2. Bring the knees in towards the chest until they're bent to 90 degrees, with feet together or crossed.<br>  3. Contract the abs to curl the hips off the floor, reaching the legs up towards the ceiling.<br>  4. Lower and repeat for 12-16 reps. <br>  5. It's a very small movement, so try to use your abs to lift your hips rather than swinging your legs and creating momentum. ]<br>  <br>  cycle position [ 1. Lie face up on the floor and lace your fingers behind your head.<br>  2. Bring the knees in towards the chest and lift the shoulder blades off the ground without pulling on the neck.<br>  3. Straighten the left leg out while simultaneously turning the upper body to the right, bringing the left elbow towards the right knee.<br>  4. Switch sides, bringing the right elbow towards the left knee.<br>  5. Continue alternating sides in a 'pedaling' motion for 12-16 reps.  ]<br>  <br>  the ball crunch [1. Lie face-up with the ball resting under your mid/lower back.<br>  2. Cross your arms over the chest or place them behind your head. <br>  3. Contract your abs to lift your torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips.<br>  4. As you curl up, keep the ball stable (i.e., you shouldn't roll).<br>  5. Lower back down, getting a stretch in the abs, and repeat for 12-16 reps. ]<br>  <br>  and finally the plank [1. Lie face down on mat resting on the forearms, palms flat on the floor.<br>  2. Push off the floor, raising up onto toes and resting on the elbows.<br>  3. Keep your back flat, in a straight line from head to heels.<br>  4. Tilt your pelvis and contract your abdominals to prevent your rear end from sticking up in the air. <br>  5.

I get it medium hot and just turn it the opposite way you normally would, hold it like you are going to flip your hair out but pull it straight down instead of wrapping your hair around it. It's fast and easy and you only have to own one hair tool instead of a few. I used my friends $100 ceramic hair straightener and I hated it, I went back to using my curling iron! Also put some product in your hair first.|`|A0FjxXyDaa	if you blow dry your hair first it makes it hot. towel drying will make it frizzy. i am new to straightening too and have short hair but i need to straighten it so what works well for me is to heat it to the max and then clamp down very tight (not pulling of course) and slide it down slowly.

Try to wear cotton and natural fabrics next to your skin to let it breath, shave your underarms (if you dont already) and try to wear cooler clothing when possible.  Your doctor can also prescribe a more powerful antiperspirant, or in extreme cases you can get underarm botox injections! (not always avalable on the nhs).

nV7XBzGAaa	hey, first off, pale skin is fine:) but if you want a healthy glow, don't burn yourself! that is a sure ticket to skin cancer. make sure you aren't deficient in iron, and if you are get on a supplement and/or eat more iron rich foods (dark leafy greens, eggs, beans. lentils, raisins and red meat). and i know you said no makeup but Eminence makes an amazing mineral bronzing powder that is also a sunscreen. i use it pretty much every day and it feels super light and looks perfectly natural. so i've added the link to their site for you just in case. the item is in their "Sun defence" section<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eminenceorganics.com/news/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eminenceorganics.com/news/ind...</a>|`|Mwhclezaaa	lots of carrots will turn you a yellowish orange (and i mean lots) and tomatoes will give you a red tint.

Fake tan is an option, but I've found it very orange & doesn't go on nicely if you have dry skin.  I found a wonder product for a subtle tint- carrot, Orange & vitamin E cream- v rich & hydrating, & gives a healthy glow.  Mine is made by a company in Kent called meadows.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	It's a few years since I had mine done (it's retired now) but I'm 99% certain I didn't get any mouthwash when they did it. I've also had my tongue pierced in a very good studio and I didn't get mouthwash then. And I went with my friend to get a labret not long ago and I don't remember them giving her mouthwash either. The only thing I had was some water to swill my mouth out afterwards. And it never got infected. So this sounds to me like it's not a necessity, just something some places do. She should have marked a dot, however, they should do this with all piercings. That is just to stop you getting a wonky piercing though, and to check it is where you want it. It wouldn't affect the health of the piercing. My only thoughts were that she may have been a very experienced piercer who didn't need the guideline for herself, and didn't need to check with you because you'd said you didn't mind. Even so, I think she should have gone through the motions of it just for professionalism sake, but this is probably the reason if otherwise you did your research and it is a good studio. <br>  <br>  (I'll just say though, anywhere can say they have the best hygeine standards around, nowhere is going to say 'well we're okay but this place down the street is better' are they).<br>  <br>  As for not thinking it hurt - well I'm not sure who told you that but it does hurt lol. Pain is relative for everybody though. Some people find things not too bad and others find them terrible, it's the same with tattoos. I remember to this day my lip piercing was very painful!<br>  <br>  As for your last part, it's hard to say without seeing it whether you're just experiencing normal first day pain or if it's something more. Swelling, redness and some pain is normal. What you're describing does sound a bit excessive though. Is there a doctors or a walk in surgery you can go to today and get it checked out? I would avoid going back to the studio - 1. They're not medical professionals and 2. They're not going to want to admit they've done a crappy job, if they have. You may just be having a bit of a bad time with it and will end up fine, but if you are in a great deal of pain I would try and get it seen asap, you shouldn't really be in that much discomfort. If the worst comes to the worst and you cannot get seen and it is causing you pain to the point where you can't sleep tonight, then I would suggest taking the piercing out, letting it heal and starting again in a couple of months, at a different studio. If you end up having to do this, wash your piercing in saltwater before trying to take it out, try and get rid of any crust there is on the bar. It will hurt but you'll experience somewhat relief afterwards. And if you take it out, keep treating the area as you would have been doing - it is still an open wound and prone to infection. Hope it doesn't come to that though. Good luck.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	You sound like this is a surprise to you.  What did you think would happen when they put a needle through your lip?  It's gonna be sore for awhile and it will probably be swollen.  Don't worry about it unless it get infected.|`|7eN6UERqaa	When I got mine done they marked it and made my use mouthwash and stuff but I don't think that really matters if she knew where she was going to be putting the needle. As long as they sterilised the needle it should be fine, but I would just make sure to look after and use Salene on it every day.|`|lwkg4RLgaa	hi, i'm no expert but it sounds like it wasn't done correctly! hygienic procedures should have been followed. i suggest you go to the doctors and get it checked or something? hope i help! x|`|HCy5T55taa	Go to the doctor before it gets worse. If you decide to get the same piercing done again get a rocommendation from someone who has gotten a piercing.|`|AA11632061	I didn't have no wash nothing same like you. It hurts like hell I know and after that I had 2 weeks of pain non stop it swollen a lot and all that as well so it is normal. But the mistake was that you didn't find a place where you like it to be!!! And she did it just to take your money. So that's it. Don't be scared use Betadine few times a day to protect from infections and if it really hurts get some alcohol on the place and it will be over soon!<br>  GOOD LUCK

k2vvT6glaa	Hey<br>  You can get your brows tinted. They do this at most beauty salons, and it doesn't cost much. Basically, it's just like dying your hair, but only with your eyebrows :)|`|nV7XBzGAaa	rather than an eyebrow pencil, i find that a dark brown eyeshadow, applied with a stiff angled brush works the best and looks the most natural.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	Hey I have dyed my eyebrows, just smear a little of the dye on each one BUT please be careful not to drop it into your eyes and when you are washing the dye out of your hair and eyebrows DON'T open your eyes for about 5 minutes or if you are having it professionally done they can do it for you, just ask.|`|ZCcHS7N5aa	tint your eyebrows... can only be about ￡3

Auburn hair is really pretty too ( for a girl)|`|g44nZlCTaa	Depends upon the skin tone.  What is the secondary skin tone?  If you press on your knuckles, what color are they?  For example if a pink secondary tone, then reddish hair.  If an orangish pink tone, then copper.  If the secondary skin tone is light tan, then dirty blonde; if it's light brown, then auburn with mahonagy highlights, etc.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	Depends on the girl. I like dark brown or black hair on girls or light brown with blonde highlights.

sUH902cDaa	Your boyfriend is clearly a very jealous person and cant bear for other men to look at you, its bascially his way of making sure your his, and keeping control of that<br>  <br>  but newsflash hunni--> you shouldn't let anyone dictate how you live your life, if he's already ripped up your bikinis that's not right..sounds a bit possessive! If you really wanna carry on wearing your bikinis make it clear...your wearing what you want! Bet you don't tell him what to wear!!!!|`|TmgEbCrZaa	hes just not wanting other guys looking at you..<br>  probabily a good thing that he want you only for himself, but it must mean that he has low self confidence, and not prepared to fight for you if you like another guy|`|aHER8myJaa	he sounds like a control freak who's trying to tighten his grip on you.

And what kind of boyfriend tells you you look bad anyway?<br>  <br>  He sounds like a control freak, he should be secure enough in the relationship that he doesn't mind what you wear. And if he feels insecure, he should be able to tell you why in a calm way rather than throwing a tantrum like a child.<br>  <br>  I am 21 and if I was with a guy like that he would be gone. A boyfriend should think you look beautiful and enjoy it when you show your body, because he should also understand that you will always come back to him regardless of who else is looking.|`|zBwyfE92aa	wow, sounds like you may need a new boyfriend, but that is not my business..

CjPtAEzmaa	The consequences, I hate to tell you, are death. (Keep reading, it gets better). For 'the wages of sin is death' (that's from Romans...can't remember exact verse). Your friend, like everyone else in the world, now deserves to die. BUT WAIT! God loved us so much with His incomprehensible  love that He gave His son to die for us instead. The price has been paid. If your friend is truly sorry and repentant, he should just pray to God, telling Him honestly and in his own words how bad he feels and how he doesn't want to do that again. God will forgive him. He's promised to do so. That's the beauty of God. However, that does not mean you can just make mistakes, 'repent', and go on living as you lived before. Jesus said once to a woman He saved from stoning, "Go now and leave your life of sin." To keep this from happening again, your friend should pray, worship, read his Bible, or anything else he feels brings him closer to God. See, the closer you are to God, the less appealing sin seems, and the better skills you have to fight temptation.<br>  <br>  :) God bless!
F69WYrtBaa	The first answer - <br>  My mother said, "If you've got nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all" I guess your mother didn't teach you that.<br>  <br>  - I can totally relate. They sell size 10 - and that's the biggest size!<br>  It really does tick me off, too. I'm curvy and I'm pretty tall, which makes it even worse! <br>  <br>  Just to buy skinny jeans, you have to buy them off eBay! <br>  <br>  I think it's because there is so many anorexic models. <br>  Gay guys tend to make the clothing, for skinny guys.<br>  But they don't seem to think about the rest of the World.<br>  <br>  People have to accept that we can't all be the same, we range in different shapes and sizes! I think that people should make clothing for any size!<br>  <br>  <br>  It's so ridiculous! Young girls, think that being fat is like the end of the World, their own MOTHERS tell them! That's being fake!<br>  <br>  God bless always ! x|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	I hope that I can explain clearly, trends that have come about since computers and software have emerged.<br>  <br>  Store owners and buyers, up to that time, used their own judgment when planning and buying merchandise assortments, including size ranges.<br>  Their, and my, goal was to serve the needs of all their, and my, potential customers.  Without exception, we were able to analyze and determine the products and the size ranges that produced the most business.  This group of products and sizes accounted for the greatest source of profits.<br>  <br>  At the same time, we carried fringe merchandise and fringe sizes and recognized that often times those created the most markdowns.  We accepted that in order to serve those customers like you.<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question.  I'm retired for several years now.<br>  <br>  With the advent of software and computers, store owners and buyers, no longer fully depend on their own judgment.  They base most of their decisions on the output of that software program.<br>  Those programs are able to analyze products and "sizes" that produce the majority of sales and the greatest profits in the finest details.<br>  This has resulted in buyers concentrating only on those items and sizes which sell and produce the the most profit and least markdowns.<br>  <br>  I think that computers and software have diminished the abilities of human decision making as well as some human error.  This has resulted in customers like yourself being ignored.<br>  I hate to say this, but you are not a profitable customer any longer.<br>  <br>  The other side of that statement is this.  <br>  When I stocked your size in fashions that you wanted, you were my customer for life, so to speak.<br>  <br>  The reason you have to resort to the internet is simply that the market is global for those in your situation, and therefore a larger market exists.|`|Z6PsZfEeaa	Because they obviously don't want fatties taking up all the room in their shop!

A small bottle costs about $15.  You can get it at any cosmetic store - I got mine at WalMart.  The redness won't entirely disappear but it will fade and become less noticeable.  It works for me.  Good luck.|`|IAIBzgOgaa	you need to go to a dermatologist for sure, theyll direct you to some decent laser surgeons and you could also just spend a while trying to research it online and youll find a lot like I did but be patient, good luck|`|i4nXnIOfaa	You can go to a dermatologist and get acne medicine there that will be exactly what your skin need's and  the doctor should be able to do something about the acne scar's I believe that they have a laser procedure that they can do to help with that. I have heard that proactive work's pretty well. Too cover up the redness you can use foundation and power to help mask the redness. Make sure that you wash your face really good in the mourning and at night thou so you do not break out from the make up. There is mineral make up on the market that is really good it allows your skin to breath and does not clog your pores  as much as a lot of the make up out there. As far as everyone making fun of you that is pretty much shame on them a lot of times the people made fun of in school tend to grow up and be some of the most intelligent and attractive people out there and then all the cool kids are living in a trailer park with six kids working on there fourth marriage. You will have your day good luck!|`|J4Fc1Ddraa	Im so sorry to hear that about your faces. Do you try bareminerals? it suppose to be natural try it, you have nothing else to lose, maybe you like it,|`|l8yXj7uWaa	two words 'YOUR GORGEOUS'!!!<br>  <br>  dont give one about what people think they only pick on people tomake them selfs feel better, and ive actually always wanted a scar because i dont want to be the sma eas anyone. <br>  <br>  its normal to go red in the face, but you can sort that out by either using makeup on put a fake tann on your face.<br>  <br>  awww blesss you bbe it most of been awwful, i hate it when bullies pick on people i think their childish and need to grow up and look at the real outside world, not everything is going to be perfect and theirs alot more things to worry about in the world than looking better than anyone.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your blood pressure rises when you are under stress. It happens to me too and I sweat heavily when under anxiety too. I'm trying hynotherapy at the moment but am not convinced. However, I have noticed this week that I have stopped allowing things to stress me out so much. I've dealt with the worries and eliminated as much as I can and do deep breathing. The doctor says I suffer from the redness thing, but I am more convinced it is a reaction to anxiety. Aim for a stress free life and very good luck!<br>  <br>  also drink more water! that helps to (:

Permanently is a pretty drastic step.  If you want to do this at home, then start by using clippers to cut all your hair off, and then shave it to the scalp.  After that, use a product like Nair when it starts to grow back.  While it doesn't last permanently it is like waxing hair, with each use it takes longer to grow back.  Plus it leaves you room to change your mind.  I suggest you go to a salon and talk to a professional if you want a product you can't buy in a drugstore.  Outside of that my friend once had a very bad perm done that made her hair fall out.....|`|Grdbn3QAaa	i dont reccomend using nair like this person ^ you can either bleach your hair until it all falls out, and usually that will make it fall out. using nair doesnt work because your hair will start growing back after about 2 weeks.

x6Ok9VsIaa	I am a barber. My advice is to get a pair of "blending shears" NOT thinning and they should have no less that 39 teeth Tondeo blenders are expensive but very very good about $150 and up but the downside is they are kind of hard to find if you cant try Fromm they also have a good quality blender. The difference between them is that blenders balance the hair and can give you a texturized look (use them only on the ends of the hair!!) "texturizing shears" (less that 20 or so teeth) chop the hair up they damage the haircut more than doing any so called texturizing and never, ever, ever use your blenders near the scalp only at the ends. On the clipper question, if you want an excellent clipper use Oster Fast Feed they will never fail you and they are also great for tapering and make sure to get you a finishing clipper (for necklines) use the Oster T- finisher it has a t-blade that is absolutely without a doubt the best at making a perfect neckline. You are only as good as your tools so if you buy crap your work will be crap, but if you buy quality..you get the idea. Hope this helps.|`|aWVWfQNMaa	You can get a reasonablly good pair for around that much. Check out Centrex shears they have a variety.

cd2b6f1746038afa51bc00268df891e2aa	Hi 2sweet, <br>  I'm a hairstylist who has done sooooo many colors to my hair prior to receiving my license. I will tell you i understand about the money cost of going from red to blond. It can cost a lot to most Salon's it's considered a corrective color process, how ever I strongly don't recomemd this step at home in order for you to go from red to  blond at home you would most likely would  be bleaching every thing out ,and that my friend can cause some serious damage to your locks. red is the hardest color to lift out besides black. My recomandation would have the colorist at the salon of your choice to do a very heavy highlight allover the head and do it in steps so as not to destroy your hair , a lot of times when you strip color out of your hair you also have to cut a lot off. So if your looking to keep it a certain length i would suggest doing the heavy highlights every 4 to 6 weeks . Good luck Sweetie I'm sure your gonna look great as a blond.|`|OpGNPgyOaa	dont try to do anythign to your hair. it will be a waste of time. if your red and your trying to go to blonde. that is easy. when you go to the salon it wont cost much. <br>  because they would have to do it anyway. what they plan to do is strip the hair to a pale yellow and then tone it. walla your blonde.<br>  <br>  all you have to do now is get the shimmer light shampoo which is violet base. it will make your hair look shiny, healthy, and take out any brassiness. condition your hair with moisturizing shampoo. rinse with luke warm water, and always use a protective cream or spray in your hair before blowdrying.|`|afiSg84Vaa	If you mess up, it will cost more at the salon. Also the coloring is usually a set in stone price so doing anything at home won't bring the price down, unless a colorist is just trying to rip you off. Red hair is very easy to color blonde, especially if it's lighter. It's more of a pain to bring dark hair to a blonde. I'd definitely shop around for a colorist and ask questions about the price and procedure. If he/she is reluctant to answer, it's not worth your time. If you have any specific questions, be sure to email me. Best of luck! :)|`|vbVzoD1Qaa	Please do not do anything chemical to your hair prior to going in.  You could easily make the situation more difficult for the colorist.  Are you an artificial red or natural red head?  What is your desired outcome?  Really the only thing that I would recommend is to do a protein and moisture treatment such as K pak by Joico or Extreme by Redken as least 2 days prior to going in.  That is it.  Best of luck.|`|Dzff3BlVaa	Actually, any time you go from darker to lighter, always do it at the salon. I tried going to blonde before going to the salon, and my hair turned ORANGE.
naYNmvmyaa	your roots might be oily and then the rest of your hair is dry because the oils from your roots aren`t getting distributed to the rest of your hair. also i suggest you use head and shoulderfs only if you have dandruff but dont use it if your scalp is really oily because thats for dry scalp. heres a list on what i think you should do to help your hair<br>  <br>  1. only once a month use a clarifying shampoo like herbal essences degunkify  (this will remove build up and excess oils that are making your hair oily and limp)<br>  <br>  2. on a daily basis use aussie moist shampoo/conditioner they work great!<br>  <br>  good luck i hope this helped!<br>  <br>  ps. i tryed using sunsilk defrizz and did not like it at all but everyones hair is different so give it a try instead of aussie if you want to!|`|AA11256581	prob.... talk to your doctor.|`|FxYQiBSEaa	try www.lacewigsforme.com|`|Se1aB3tnaa	I'm not sure about the sunsilk but i've found that tresume products work well without making it feel like you have alot of crap in your hair. it doesn't make your hair "crunchy"  or extra oily.|`|9b6c2715c64af15c57a8f2f4c378b5a2aa	I know of a dandruff shampoo that is far superior to anything you will find in the stores. It moisturizes the scalp instead of medicating it. SunSilk dandruff uses the same principle and is pretty good, but Yves Rocher is great stuff. They would also have a defrizz shampoo, too.<br>  <br>  Link to dandruff shampoo:<br>  <a href="http://www.yvesrocherusa.com/control/product/~category_id=1053/~pcategory=M00008-USA/~product_id=31244" rel="nofollow">http://www.yvesrocherusa.com/control/pro...</a><br>  <br>  They have replinishing shampoo and conditioner:<br>  <a href="http://www.yvesrocherusa.com/control/product/~category_id=M00008-USA/~categoryFilterType=ByHair/~categoryFilterBy=Dry,_damaged/~product_id=31382" rel="nofollow">http://www.yvesrocherusa.com/control/pro...</a><br>  <br>  If you are like me, you will just use the dandruff shampoo every day. It leaves your hair very soft. The regular price is $6 a bottle, but you can always find it on their website for about half that. Their lipstick is really soft, too. Good luck.|`|2bgU7sMRaa	don't use h and s, it weakens you're hair and makes it brittle and strawlike, i have greasy hair also which i tend to wash nearly everyday i know i'm not supposed to but my hair is just so used to it now. because you're hair is greasy don't ever apply conditioner to you're scalp, just the ends and then rinse out with cold water to lock in the moisture i find that herbal essences conditioners are great as they leave you're hair shiny and smelling gorgeous

Just try to keep the area clean use the cleaner they gave you or rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, etc. Try not to get soap or shampoo inside the piercing.... Hope I helped..|`|KNgGPjrzaa	well with mine it was sore for the couple of first weeks, but if yours doesn't hurt now i don't think its likely to start. Just make sure for the next month or so you don't catch it on anything or bang it as it might get sore. Just make sure that you keep cleaning it aswel and you should start to notice it becomes less tender, and redness dies down, until eventually it's healed.|`|i8NcF0Graa	You should use antibacterial soap like Dial.  Avoid anything with fragrance.  You can use peroxide for cleaning also and salt water solution.  It helps get the puss out for healing thats what I do.

DMZPF8L8aa	omg my hair is the same and side bangs are really trendy. go to a ur hair salon person ask her to straighten your hair and ask her about good hair serum products,get a good hair dryer with a diffuser thing. or try getting a perm and see if you like straight hair. global beauty hair straightener is really good!|`|b0027bb7bd1c2e6b06802339ac366191aa	Why not get bangs and straighten them? Whoever says you have a big forehead is kind of rude. It's no big deal to have a big forehead, all the models have them! Hello Tyra Banks!|`|vtmDrCXQaa	I think you should cut some bangs, that layer to the side like this, and you could just keep the bangs straitened with a flat iron or curling iron  & still wear a pony tail for the rest of your hair! (it'll look really cute!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Look at this link>>>>|`|VKQcAW1Zaa	Why dont you try a perm and wear it straight w/ swing bangs to go across your forehead in an angle. I am mixed too so I either perm it to wear it straight or just go to the dominicans and let them do it. They will hook it up.
kEid4Dm2aa	It depends on what gauge your piercing your piercing is. if you had it done with a needle i think captive bead rings are the best, and they can be brought from hundreds of stores online. if your piercing was done with a gun then you can use the type of earrings you would have in your ear lobes. if your not sure about the gauge its best to visit a store rather than shop online, so you can judge yourself whether the earring will fit.
