AA11452852	Yes, UPS (and the USPS, too) charge rates for packages that based on zones, that is, on the distance the package is going.    US First Class mail goes at a flat rate, and so does Priority Mail.  For a small package, that can sometimes be cheaper than UPS or USPS parcel rates.    I hope this helps!!

yq4AL4Bfaa	Hi there...  I am origionally from Manchester... North of England..   My advise would be to steer away from London.  It is expensive dirty and the taxes in England are becoming more and more expensive.   London is one of the most unfriendly citys i have ever been to. This coupled with the constant harrassment beggars and thieves when you use the Underground is awful.   If  I was to move back to England  I would look more closely at York or Chester or even Bath.   These are beautiful cities but are not without problems.    One of the scary things about  England is the Yob culture....   gangs of kids from ages 8 to 17 basically running housing estates and yes actually killing people.    The London way of life do you mean the way of life of those who work in high finance??  because thats not the london lifestyle way of life...  ( i have friends in high finance in London) They say the pressure is such that drug taking and drinking is out of control.  But anyway....   I am not a bias Northerner  I am a realist ...  And  to  be honest The USA  wil offer you more opportunities and a far better lifestyle.    If you mist move to England  Look at York,  look at Chester.  Chester is near to where the most affluent people in the UK live.  Just up the road is the Highest concentration of millionaires in the whole of the UK.  Thats the cheshire area.     I wish you luck with your future..|`|S5H0NmEWaa	Why wouldn't it be possible? You are best advised to think about what sector you want to work in and then investigate opportunities in that sector, by contacting relevant organisations or looking at their websites.

AA11452852	Hello, Kiran--    I think you need to get the advice of people who know the law about restaurant and bar licenses in Andhra Pradesh, and the way to get in contact with them is through the India section of Yahoo Answers.   Many more people who know about Indian law will read your question there than in the USA section.  I think they answers you get there will be more accurate and up-to-date than what you might get in this section.    Good luck!!
AA11452852	No special paper is required.  Lawyers like to use a "backer" (a folder that is usually made of blue paper and stapled to the document), but that's not necessary.  Plain typewriter or printer paper is just fine.    You do not absolutely need an attorney if you know your way around legal documents.  However, it might be worth while to pay one.  A good lawyer will spend a few minutes asking you what you want and don't want to say in the power of attorney.  You don't want to forget something important, and you also don't want to give away too much power.  A half-hour or so with a lawyer will ensure that your power of attorney fits your needs.      There are forms you can buy on the Internet, and they will do the job,  but they are written for the average situation, and everyone I know has some particular issue that is not quite handled right in the forms.  It's not a big deal, and if you know the right way to modify the forms you can do this yourself.  But if you are not used to dealing with legal documents, it can be a little tricky.  It's up to you how comfortable you feel handling it on your own.    Whether you write your own power of attorney or have a lawyer do it for you, it should be notarized.  If the lawyer does it, he can arrange for notarization in his office. Probably his secretary or someone else in the office will have a notary's seal.  If you draft your own document, take it to your bank.  Many banks will notarize documents for their customers without charge.  And even if there is a charge, it will just be a few dollars.     I hope this helps.  Good luck!!
AA11452852	No, sorry.  The only law school in the state is the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  You can check them out here:    http://www.law.unlv.edu/    Good luck!!

62cf745b22f4e8647a1ae0245414635caa	It depends if you are working for someone else like a cruise line or a chiropractor or if you go out on your own. If you go out on your own , it is about 25,000 a year working for someone else, it basically depends. The area your in also effects that amount you make.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Most massage therapist do not get paid by the hour. They get paid by the massage. So it would depend on what type of massage one was offering, in addition, to the time required to provide such.
o0JD0hitaa	The answer to that question depends on a range of factors.    If you're working in a spa or a Chiropractor's office and they pay you an hourly wage, it will likely be barely above minimum wage.    If you are paid per massage performed - commission or some other similar arrangement, in the same environment and including fitness centers, hospitals, and massage clinics - I have heard figures ranging from 30-80% or $12-50/hour being common.    If you rent a massage room from someone, including the businesses above or someone who owns an office building, you would collect all payments for your work but then have to pay expenses including rent, insurance, utilities, business cards, music, sheets, oils, and marketing costs. I charge $65/hour, which seems pretty average. Fixed expenses average about $500/month. Per massage expenses are less than $5/massage.    Your first few years may be slow - it takes time to get a good client base.|`|VpfSbqhVaa	Depends on the work place, I've heard about 24k a year.

bru2xnlRaa	Any work you do and earn money is a JOB.   Your options are limited. Most businesses want you to be 16 to hire you for gainful employment.     Time to be inventive,   My suggestions to you:    Make up fliers and pass them around in your neighborhood.   Offer to do whatever work it is you want to do, such as :    Computer work, Babysit, Clean Garages, Organize Cupboards, File Papers, Wash Cars, Mow Lawns, Pull Weeds, Tutor the neighbors kids, wash Dogs, Dog sit, Clean the Pool, Assist the elderly, whatever...       Post first whatever it is you want to do or are good at ...  However, You should keep your options open and make a decision after the persons call you instead of not giving them many reasons to call.     Say you are a student and available to work on weekends
ViHe4VhWaa	Well being 14. You can't actually get a proper job; due to being under-age.

1Mc6BOvKaa	You can complain, yes, but I wouldn't expect much to come from it.   Having done the job long enough, I know it is very difficult to meet the schedule. Bags are heavy and ideally you want to get rid of everything so you don't have to carry it around for the whole day before you go back to the office. However, because the bags are heavy and you can be sacked for putting it down somewhere, you also don't want to be running up stairs or going too far out of your way.     The postman is paid to deliver to the delivery points on his round. In other words, the letter boxes (I'm guessing your block has letter boxes on the ground floor near a communal entrance).  Anything else is his own discretion. For example, on my round, there's an old lady who lives on the first floor of a two storey house, above a young family. They share a letter box, but because the lady is concerned that the family's dog will damage her mail, I go around to the back door with her mail. I don't have to, its one of the favours I do for my customers - means you get a good working relationship with them, makes the job so much more pleasant and manageable (and you are more likely to get Christmas tips :P ).|`|tVF9O1Olaa	I am guessing your letter box is down stairs and he couldn't get the package in that so that is why he called you and asked you to come down.  Why should he walk up to you, he could of left the package on the floor as it couldn't fit into your letter box so he wasn't doing anything wrong.    You can report him but i think you will get nowhere with it. He is delivering mail he is not your slave!|`|3d1XRIzkaa	Yes, you should file a complaint to the post office and complain about the mail man refusing to bring up your package. That is his job.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Mailmen are on a very tight schedule and have a lot of deliveries. Also, they are not paid to be your personal slaves and bring the package directly to you. If there was no designated place to drop it off in a common area, they have to leave you a note to pick it up at the post office. They are often not allowed on private property. There could be a number of reasons he didn't bring you the package.     Respect post men.
