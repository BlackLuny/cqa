20090202143902AAUAoUD	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Okay, so what should I do?	Okay, so what should I do?!?!?  Okay, so I am a freshman in high school and am taking Honors Geometry. Normally I am good at math but first semester I was in panic mode and did badly in this class, as it is based solely on tests and quizzes (which make me nervous, but I'm getting better at taking tests). In order for me to move on to Honors Algebra II, I need a teacher's signature. Last semester I had a high-ish C, but that semester in general was a mess for me. Currently I have an A in Geometry, and understand everything perfectly. I am really good at Algebra, and yet my teacher says that with orchestra and Algebra II, she thinks it will be hard on me. (Yeah, I don't know where she got that from). I understand that she thinks that because of my C, I will not be prepared but trust me, I am a hard worker but a worrier. Anyway, I really, really don't want to drop out of the Honors program because I'm afraid it'll look bad on a transcript (especially if I do really well in Algebra II) and like I'm not up to a challenge. And with Honors Algebra II, I'll have 2 honors classes and 2 AP classes and I think that's a reasonably good schedule for next year.     So what should I do? Should I drop out of Honors math? And how bad will it look on my transcript?    Thanks!

20090202171351AAS6XIv	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Where did the term Evil Overlord come from, and to what does it apply?	My dad and I are in a disagreement. While both of us think that Evil Overlords (the term) came from science fiction and fantasy writers, I think that there are Overlords in our real life, and I don't mean people like me who joke about making evil plans to take over the world. I think people like Hitler and Mussolini and Castro, and the Dictator of North Korea, etc. all qualify as real-life Evil Overlords. Dad thinks that the term Evil Overlord only applies to fiction, and that the people mentioned above are all either dictators or power thirsty leaders. I agree with this, but I definitely think they should be called Evil Overlords. He doesn't see that there are two kinds of Evil: my kind (the joking about evil minions and penguins, you get the idea), and the bloodthirsty kind that people like Hitler and the President of Iran possess. What say you?

20090202191503AAmxe5X	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone edit my paragraph?	First impressions typically give people the opportunity to decide whether of not a person is worth their time. However, does a first impression really show a persons character? In my opinion, first impressions aren’t always accurate; nevertheless many people can make or break a relationship with another by giving off a good or bad first impression. To begin, a first impression is not always right, as every now and then people are just plain unlucky. Everyone has off days, but if you happen to be making a first impression on one of those days, it can become catastrophic. Deep down, you can be a good person, but by the way things keep occurring, it may not seem that way to others. Secondly, some people just give off a bad vibe, even though deep down they are a great person. For example, if a person were to walk in a room wearing all black, with rings in every orifice of their face, does that really mean that they are a bad person? Personally, I don’t believe that a person’s appearance gives you a direct view of their overall character. If you judge someone based on appearance only, you’ll miss out on getting to know a lot of great people. Thirdly, everyone always tries their hardest to make someone like them based on their first impression. Even the most irritating person in the world can easily give someone a good first impression. If you judge everyone based on first impressions, you’ll miss out on getting to know a lot of amazing people.            Also, can anyone think of a good title?   Thanks in advance! =D

20090202192347AArakWe	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Homework help? essay on Mesopotamian literature? ?	Mesopotamian Literature   The Mesopotamian were the first to implement a written language. The earliest language written in Mesopotamia was Sumerian. Sumerian is a language based on symbols, and many monosyllabic words. In Southern Mesopotamia more than 5000 years ago, the language Sumerian was invented. This would influence the style of scripts in the same geographical area for the next 3000 years. Eventually all these diverse writing systems from consonantal alphabetic, to syllabic systems, were soon known as cuneiform a "wedge-shaped."    They used small clay objects in abstract shapes, called clay tokens, that were apparently used for counting agricultural and manufactured goods.  They used different kinds of small marks to count the number of objects. They basically used it for accounting.  The Sumerian writing system during the early periods was constantly changed. There writing, was markings on clay. Id describe them as triangular and squiggly shapes.   Hammurabi's code, which was written in this time period, is very important because it is the first known set of written laws.  The name of Hammurabi came from a king. The king of  Babylon. Hammurabi is best known for extending a new code of Babylonian law.  The laws were written on large stone monuments. It is thanks to the hammurabi law codes that we have our existing law systems today

In fact some schools I want to apply too have more Hispanics and African Americans than Asians. Would affirmative action help me at THAT point or would it STILL go against me as they expect more out of me and Asians are not minorities in overall college, My GPA is not bad. a 3.3, which I understand is not up to par with other Asians. I have a 3.8 Weighted I got 1,960 on my SATs. I want to know if CERTAIN schools such as the ones I listed above with less asians would benefit me for being Asian or should I just not report my race?

20090202202923AAx8qXj	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Could you please correct English grammar mistakes I made in a letter?	    Dear Mrs. xx      Yujin told me that she can’t change her current schedule regarding on the matter of PE8.   Please understand why I am telling this:      The reason Yujin did not really want to take PE8 course on 1st term was because she was told PE is much harder than in Korea.  She wanted to take some time and to be ready in her mind for the class.  I thought there would be no problem even if she can take PE8 on 2nd term.  When we visited your office, you kindly helped out with Yujin’s schedule to get rid of her PE8 on the 1st term schedule and replaced computer course after all.      However, I realized that I misunderstood about PE8.   First of all, I thought she can complete PE8 by taking it in either the 1st term or the 2nd term twice week such as Fine Arts8 Yujin took in her 1st term.  By the time Yujin gets her 2nd term schedule, I got to understand about Academic course searching on the Internet.  I also realized Yujin will probably complete PE8 by attending twice week in both 1st term and 2nd term according to the information I had got.      That’s why, one day, I said to you Yujin has to take PE8 four times a week in 2nd term so that she won’t have any trouble when she is in Gr 9.  As you may remember, you agreed with this and Yujin has finally got the current schedule.      However, the reason I asked Yujin to visit your office on Monday is because I found a schedule received on Sep 23, 08 from the office. I thought Yujin might be able to take half PE8 when she is in Gr.9 because term 3[=2nd term] says that she can take PE8 twice a week as shown below.      I am sorry for Yujin because she told me that she will probably be the only student taking PE8 four times a week and attend PE8 class Mon through Fri.  It was my big mistake that I did not fully understand about this required academic course, PE8 when we were working on the schedule.       I just wish she could take half PE8 when she is in Gr.9 while she take PE8 twice a week on the 2nd term in Gr.8.  I always care for Yujin. I just want her to be happy whether at home or at school. I wish she were as tough as local girls.  I should’ve asked about PE8 enough so that Yujin would get a schedule that she satisfied.  It was my mistake…      Regards,

20090202142943AA6Wgbc	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Grammar check, plz!!~~~~?	The cause what I stated in the beginning made that government prepares to hire math and science teachers.

Students can’t do math and science works by themselves otherwise teachers don’t teach or help them. As I recall on high school life, there was a good math and science teachers for sure.
