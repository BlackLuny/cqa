Is the formula for interest compounding several times per year:      A = P(1+r/n)^nt      or is it A = P(1+r/2)^n+t      ^ = to the power of  / = vinculum      A = total amount after end of time period   P = original amount   r = interest rate per annum   n = number of compounding periods per year   t = time (number of years)      I used the first formula and I got this:      originally $1000 at 20% (0.2) p.a, compounding 5 times per year for 3 years:      A = $1000(1+0.2/5)^3x5      = $1000x1.004^15      = $1061.7088         Did I do that right?

The amount of calcium carbonate (CaCO3; molar mass = 100.1 g/mol) in the ore dolomite can be determined by gravimetric analysis. The dolomite sample is dissolved in acid and the calcium ions (Ca2+) present are precipitated as calcium oxalate (CaC2O4; molar mass = 128.1 g mol/1). The calcium oxalate is fltered, dried   and strongly heated to form calcium oxide (CaO; molar mass = 56.1 g mol).      In one analysis the mass of dolomite used was 3.72 g. The mass of calcium oxide formed was found to be 1.24 g.   The percentage of calcium carbonate in the dolomite sample is closest to:   A. 26.9   B. 33.3   C. 56.0   D. 59.5         Two possible sources of error in this analysis are   I. the precipitate of calcium oxalate is not rinsed with water after being fltered.   II. the calcium oxide is not heated to constant mass.   Which of these two errors, if any, would lead to a result that is too high?      A. I only   B. II only   C. both I and II   D. neither I nor II

20090310052521AAv6rKQ	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	A closer look at exoplanets. Interstellar probes or hyper telescopes?	Suppose a really good reconnaissance of another star's planets was desired. It would be something on a par with Voyager 2's tour of the solar system's planets, giving most of them a quick look during a flyby, and using the gravity of each planet to reach the next one. It would be smart enough to do its own trajectory calculations and mission planning. If there's a planet in or near the liquid water zone, it would try to end its mission by orbiting it for a detailed examination.      One problem with such a probe is finding a power source that could last for the duration of the interstellar trip, perhaps 60000 years.      Another problem, of course, is the long wait: 60000 years. And that's assuming a fairly fast hyperbolic excess speed of 50 km/sec.      (Do flying saucer freaks see why nobody buys their flimflam?)      Or do we build ever-larger telescopes in space, until we finally can see those distant Earths across the gulf of space?

Jill wanted to buy a great birthday gift for her best friend Shawna. Unfortunately, she had forgotten that back in July she had spent most of all her savings on a new indoor leather basketball. When jill cracked open her piggy bank, she found 100 coins. They were all pennies, dimes, and half-dollars. There wasn't a single nickel or quarter in the bank. When Jill had finished counting up all these coins, she found that she had exactly five dollars. How many coins of each denomination were in Jill's bank?

20090310041457AApkNqU	Science & Mathematics;Biology	If my penis was 9 miles long, how tall would I be?	I'm terrible with math, really. I need this for a fantasy story. Imagine a giant man, of an average height (when compared to a normal sized man) and average weight. With a penis that is nine miles long, fully erect. How tall is he? How much does he weigh if the world's gravity is the same as Earth?       I know some of you must be laughing, that's okay. This problem has been driving me crazy though, because until I figure out how big the giants are, I cannot figure out how big the island they live on is, or the planet.       His penis size is slightly above average, like the average penis size  is 5-6in, in this world the equivalent would be similar, only in miles.      Only serious replies will be considered for best answer.

20090310042953AAGEuo3	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does a High (tall) room cost more to Air condition than a lower ceiling room of the same dimensions?	I have been playing in my mind with an interesting problem whose answer is not obvious to me, but I'm sure if analyzed from a physics point of view the answer might be obvious.      Consider two rooms identical in materials and insulation properties.      Room 1 is 10 feet by 10 feet  by 10 feet.      Room 2 is 10 feet by 10 feet by  20 feet high.       Both rooms need to be air conditioned but you only need cool the lowest six feet of each room, as this is the space where people actually live. Of course we know that cool air sinks. Thus the question is, does it cost more to cool room 2 than room 1? or is the cost the same?      When i analyze the problem and consider the cooler air like a liquid flowing to the bottom then it seems the cost would be the same      However if i analyze it in turns of heat transfer and convection then it would cost more to cool the bigger room.       Is the answer obvious to you?

20090225084527AAyfrkj	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Can you name any problems with the concept of Data on Star Trek?	Yeah, yeah, I know the show has been cancelled since 1994, but it's ran through my head for awhile.   My thoughts: Why would a machine capable of reading a full-length novel in a few seconds spend time talking and interacting at the incredibly slow rate of humans?    Data never tired, so why would he not also move and think in fastforward all the time?   In an episode or two, he claimed that he had a program that made him look like he aged through the years. How in the world would this be possible with synthetic materials?   Data breathed. Why? He didn't need to, as time and again we see him fully functional in places without air (like space).   Data could eat and drink (to analyze), but it wasn't necessary for his survival. How did he process sustanance? How did he get it out of his body afterwards?   What was Data's power source? I don't think it ever explained that.    Data was found some 20 years after his creation, and then went to Star Fleet academy for years, in all this time no one else duplicated his design/technology? Seems fair-fetched that he's be "cutting edge" for so many years. That would be like saying that the microwave was yet cutting-edge in 2009!   Data's overall data storage was 100,000 terabytes. In 1987 (when the show first aired) that prob sounded huge, but does it sound that big in 2009 when we now have 2 terabyte drives? This is supposed to be 400 years in the future!   That's about it. Please, serious answers. I know it's Star Trek, but I'm interested in serious responses. Thanks.

20090225085751AAPQpVR	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics friction problem?	You've entered a "slow ski race" where the winner is the skier who takes the longest time to go down a 15 degree slope without ever stopping. You need to choose the best wax to apply to your skis. Red wax has a coefficient of kinetic friction 0.25, yellow is 0.20, green is 0.15, and blue is 0.10. Having just finished taking physics, you realize that a wax too slippery will cause you to accelerate down the slope and lose the race. But a wax that's too sticky will cause you to stop and be disqualified. You know that a strong headwind will apply a 50 N horizontal force against you as you ski, and you know that your mass is 75 kg.      which wax should you choose for the best results?

20090227144150AA86oBu	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Questions relating to improving the (real) SVD Dragunov?	Okay. So. Before we begin, I must ask that all COD4 fanboys and people that leave 1-line replies to just hit the back button right now.      Now then. I had considered purchasing an SVD Dragunov some years back, as one of my first 5 rifles. Unfortunately, I came across many, many sites, articles, and reports that all point toward the less than stellar performance of the Dragunov. I've heard it's only good to 100 yards, but the SKS is only as good at that distance; most profs agree that 300-400 is okay, 500 pushing it.      They say the poor workmanship is the cause of the bad performance on most of them. Things they've mentioned are sheet-metal receivers, flimsy parts, snap-converted AK-47's, random gas actions, and light barrels are all contributors, the last on the line being poor optics, which matters little, especially to experienced riflemen.      Assuming you milled the receiver from high-quality steel, with an equally well made, nice and heavy barrel, equally made parts as well as tightening and dedicating the gas system, and adding a good scope/shooting match ammo through it, could you considerably improve the accuracy, and in the hands of a highly skilled marksman, could it be used to shoot 12" groups 650ft+?      [I also heard that LENGTHENING the barrel is actually more detrimental to accuracy than it helps. Is there anything that can/could/should be done to the length or the twist rate/internal beginning of the rifling?)         I heard that in the proper places, weight = recoil control, which means more accuracy, which is where the heavy barrel comes in. With all the steel that goes into production, I'd gather it would become a very heavy rifle. Also assuming weight isn't a issue, would a 100-lb. rifle made from top-notch steel really improve the accuracy any more? I'm not looking for a PSG-1; they're more expensive than some automatics, and as hard to find.      (If there *IS* any real range possibilities beyond 850 yards, I would very seriously consider an endeavor in the future to build this wonder-rifle, for hunting purposes. I was kind of partial to the largeness of the rifle for my large frame, but was turned off by the remarkable price for a very unremarkably accurate rifle. It also looks sleek with a skeleton stock; If one can be made, I'd like to know. I didn't intend to lug it around a lot for "Anti-Infantry" purposes, like some tards would suggest. I would like to use it as a fancy deer rifle, and target shooting gun when I visit my relatives in the plains up north.

I tried and got 1/x as my answer, but the book says the answer is 1/3??? No idea how to get there. Could you please show me how. I have been trying to figure this out for 2 days now.    Thanks : )

20090309163201AAXFB5V	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Faulty voltage doubling/tripling circuit?	I was building a voltage tripling circuit from www.coolcircuit.com/circuit/voltage/ (3rd schematic from the top). After constructing it with 1uF 350v capacitors and 3A 500v diodes, I noticed I was getting roughly 480vdc, not the expected 360vdc. With no other choice, I built the voltage doubler, 2nd schematic from the top on the same page. It turned out to output 320vdc, neither the expected 240vdc nor 360vdc. Are the schematics simply wrong or are my components' ratings somehow amping up the voltage? (hah! pun!) I triple checked each of the completed circuits for accuracy.

The initial speed of the box at the bottom of the incline is 1.5m/s. How far does the box travel along the incline before coming to a rest?      The question doesn't mention anything pulling the box up the incline which is weird..   The answer is supposedly 0.265m   If anyone could help me in understanding the problem and going about solving it I would be very grateful.

They say when asteroids come into our atmosphere they begin to break up, and occasionaly one will hit the ground on the earth. Sometimes it totally disolves in the atmoshere and doesn't hit. My question is,   If we had an asteroid that flew through one of the "holes" in the ozone/atmoshere, would it not break up at all and continue to crash land?      I was thinking, they say we have several holes up there causing light to trap etc, so if a meteor happened to fly through one of them, would there be no atmosphere to break it up?

The Case For A Link To Autism Spectrum Disorders, By Russell L. Blaylock, MD, 4-25-8       In 1976, children received 10 vaccines before attending school. Today they will receive over 36 injections. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Center for Disease Control assured parents that it was safe to not only give these vaccines, but that they could be given at one time with complete safety. Is this true? Or are we being lied to on a grand scale?       The medical establishment has created a set of terms, which they use constantly to boost their egos and firm up their authority as the unique holders of medical wisdom-the mantra is "evidence-based medicine", as if everything outside their anointing touch is bogus and suspect. A careful examination of many of the accepted treatments reveals that most have little or no scientific "evidence-based" data to support it.   http://www.rense.com/general81/aut.htm

I used the product rule for xy and the chain rule for the (xy + 8)^-1. i just figured out how to do implicit differentiation without looking at my notes, so i used the product rule instead of the quotient rule because i know the product rule by heart.

My statistics teacher has given the class a project without properly explaining how to do it or where we can find it in a book.
