20070610104452AAzMaHp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Am I Jealous Of My Jerk Booty Calls Girlfriend?	Been booty calling with this GEORGEOUS guy for like 8 months now. And yes, feelings on my half has start to develop. Now he is fine as hell ( He's black, korean, and french; his face looks like someone MADE it, he is literally gorgeous.) The thing is, he is a conceited jerk. And he uses and sells drugs and has 2 kids that live like 500 miles away. He loves himself more than anyone else in the world, he's a prick. AND A WHORE! But nevertheless, I am INFATUATED with his ***! Even though I know in my heart that he is NOT what I would want in a BF, I cant help but still envy his girlfriend because she is the one, out of all the girls he deals with, that can say that she has him! I would LOVE to have a man that fine on my side to do things with. Why do I envy her, when he has even told me himself that he told HER that he isn't married, so he'll do what he wants? And if you didnt know he had a girlfriend, you'd be surprised b/c the way he hangs out and hollers at hoes, he doesnt act like it.

20070701215612AADrX1L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls please help!!!!?	hi to all girls,      I m a guy who just got dumped by my g.f.  I tried everything to get her to give our relationship one more chance but she kept saying no.  She said she still loves me more than anything and the reason she ended this relationship was because of all the fights we had.  She said she is tired of all the fights so that's why she ended this relationship.  I begged, cried, and promised no more fight to get another chance with her but she still say no.  Now, she won't even answer my phone call or emails.  It seem like she doesnt want to talk to me at all even though she said she still loves me and care for me.  Any advice on why is she treating me this way if she still loves me?? Anyone can tell me why is she so cruel to me? And anyone thinks she found another guy?        Thanks!!

Finalmente llamó a sus padres para acompa?arme a casa y evitar un desastre mayor en casa, y llevarse a mi esposo, decidieron que era él quien debía ir en primer lugar a esa experiencia, y que se lo llevarían pues temían que las cosas se pusieran peor, a pesar de que no quise dejarlo tan mal, después de todo ellos son su familiam, así que solo vieron un golpe en la cara y una herida en un dedo, lo demás lo cubrió mi ropa. Ahora el está aquí, irá a su experiencia en 10 días ?hago bien?

Then he cancelled it out the next day. He said he was going to New Jersey to see a friend and that was the reason he cancelled out and on sunday afternoon he gave me a call to say hi. We briefly talked. However, I remembered something. While he was introducing me to one of his friends he said that if she asks at all you are my friend from New Jersey and I know you for a year. This put me a suspicion in my mind. Is there someone else in New Jersey?

I can tell he really likes me, just as I really like him. I mean.. we've gone pretty far "sexually" but I don't know what to expect this time. Should we just talk the whole day through and hang out? Or should I be expectant of any surprises?      Yes, I'm gay. =)

What should I do?   I want to tell him how I feel but I don't want to keep him from going to the game and seeing other friends.

I like the tall and skinny one, so anyway I don't know how to approach him because he doesn't really talk that much to some people.

20071014145602AAhcCFP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Misanthropic?	There is a certain group of people whom I choose not to be associated with because I know that they are not the right people to be around. If I were to be in the same room with them, I am quiet, shy and reserved because I have nothing to say to them. I don't feel comfortable being around them. If I don't want to talk to them, then I don't have to. I know the right people who I want to be around. So, why do they label me as being stuck-up or anti-social when all I am doing is minding my own business?   I've only got 1 best friend and a few aquintances.   I'm sort of misanthropic in public situationss.    My mother calls it anti-social. Again, its not that I hate everyone. Most people disinterest me. I'd be more than willing to talk to a competent person. Everyone just seems to be into drinking and parties.

20070905050821AA9dQTw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I keep screwing up...?	I've been dating my girlfriend for 4 months now, and we are inseperable.  I mean, we've connected on such a deep level, and even though the honeymoon phase has ended, when I see her, I still get butterflies.  I know she feels the same way about me, that's not the issue.  For some reason, over the past few weeks, I've been screwing up a lot.  I say something stupid, or do something stupid (which, it's not just her perception, I totally agree).  It's mostly little things, but it ends up being my fault that I've ruined the mood.  I'm usually very aware of my own actions, which is why I'm so distraught about my recent behaviour.  Every time I do this, I feel so horrible, and so guilty, for adding unnecessary drama to our relationship.  What should I do?  Why am I behaving this way?  I really don't want to be a stereotypical absent-minded man...
20070908195434AAXpKq3	Family & Relationships;Friends	I've got a major big delima...with several parts to it...?	There's a guy in my neighborhood that I like, let's say his name is Eric. I can tell he likes me, by the way he acts around me, he doesn't act that way around anyone else, in a good way.   There is also a guy in my church youth group, that. Let's say his name is Kyle. He's really shy, super obvious about liking me, and only joined up in youth group again because I told him I was going to be in it.    Then there's my other neighbor, whom I'm in the middle of a seemingly endless fight with right now. Let's say her name is Katie. She's a liar, is really mean, and treats me as if she's my better...when it's truly not like that. To top if off, she's really self-obsessed, she takes pictures of herself, and names them things like: "Katie the Angel".    Anyway...I'm seeing Kyle soon...and I'm afraid he's going to ask me out, if I say yes, I'll feel weird around Eric. If I say no, that could ruin Kyle and my friendship. And Vice-Versa. In all the crazy mix, Katie is being a jerk. Help Me!

Well me and my bf decided to live together just like a normal husband and wife, its not possible for us to be married coz his been married before due to unexpected pregnancy of his "x" so he has no choice (well philippine culture) and they just get married because of the baby but it not took so long coz their not comfortable with each other so it last for 1 year.  Then after that i met him and that's it we been for 4 years and now we decided to live in together.  There's no problem with his family coz they accept it since then yet my family is against with him because of his situation.  My family is too old fashion and their concern for the marriage,but what we will do?  Divorce here in the phils. didn;t exist and its against in the filipino trait.   And now the problem is im sick!  I probably have lupus not confirmed yet (though i have some symptoms)so, his family refuse me to tell our situation with my family.wat will i do?

20070810180859AAXLHyq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am a Christain and coveting men?	I am 43 and a Christian. My problem is coveting men, going out with bad ones and being absolutely devestated when I get dumped, even though I don't really care for most of them. I want God to be first and let him choose the man but can't seem to trust him. I become almost obsessed in getting men to like me and once I do I feel disatisfied. I also smoke alot when I am dating someone, obsessing about if they are going to do me wrong, and making huge dramas out of nothing. I feel unworthy of love and am self sabatoging my happiness. I don't want to live my life alone but feel I will never find true love if I keep acting this way. Anyone been in a similar state of mind? Any help would be appreciated.

20070830143533AAWS6cn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do i still love him? does he feel same as me?	I'm 20 years and I met a guy a month ago. I love him alot and i want to be in serious relationship with him. he is very good guy and respectful and i love his personality.one day me and my friends went out and he invited us to his hous, i met his mom and she likes me alot. At first she though that i'm her son's gf.   anyways that day we had so much fun and we danced slow dance and he huged me and i felt that he likes me. by the way he is little shy and he told my friend that he likes me and he told her that i'm very nice girl, but he told her that he has problem and he can't ask me out yet.Me and my friends diddn't know anything about his past and he told my friend that he loved agirl for 4 years and she broke up with him and after a week he saw her with another guy. he told my friend that they were about to get marry that this happened to them.    my friend told me his story but it was too late, that night i felt in love with him and i'm still wait for him to come an ask me out.should i

20070902233443AAEKQ1f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like this guy but I''m really afraid he doesn't like me at all. Should I see him or move on?	I've really liked this guy for about a year now. He was my friend for about 2 months until things got bad. I never told him I liked him, but we were playing a game with some friends and we kissed a couple times, so we weren't really shy with each other, if anything we were getting closer as JUST FRIENDS but then everything went straight to hell. He blamed me for ruining his chances with his dream girl who if I might add was not all that. He hated me for pretty much the rest of the year, treated me like I was nothing, called me the devil and various other things. I don't see much of him anymore, and I really miss him. Even the small glares in the hallway, or the snarky remarks about how evil I was, I really miss and would do just about anything to get back. I haven't seen him for 3 months and I recently had a dream about him where I felt really lost, like something was missing. I thought about seeing him, maybe just one last time, and now I can't stop thinking about him. Or seeing him.

20071007150037AAop8OS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Quick question: What does he (my ex-boyfriend) mean?	Me and my ex boyfriend went out for about 2 years. Over the summer we got in a lot of arguements so I just sort of faded out of his life because I started getting really busy with school/athletics and I didn't want to be upset. We haven't hung out for 7 weeks. We have a class in school but I just run out to avoid confrontation with him but we did talk sometimes. He texted me yesterday saying "we should hang out soon.." and I thought sure why not so I texted back "yeah...we should."   He responded back saying "was that sarcastic?"   Why would he think I'm being sarcastic? And is what I said back really that sarcastic?
20071009085637AA9etJ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I recently found a profile my boyfriend made on adult friend finder.?	He denies it even though I saw the confirmation email in his account. It said he hadn't used it in over three months which is around the same time he opened the account to begin with, but he swears that he never even joined the site. I told him I just wanted to truth because it would be a lot easier to deal with but he keeps insisting he never set it up. Is this possible? I've heard of people getting scammed by that site, and even people who have had their pictures taken from myspace or photobucket and found a fake profile made later. I don't know what to do, we've been together 3 years and this is really difficult. Any advice?

20071016135748AAggvGh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This guy!?	Theres this guy that I like and he flirts with every girl he sits next to! Its crazy! He flirts with me and two other girls! I hate these other girls! They are so mean to me and super skinny! They dont eat anything! I dont know why he likes them! They arent his type! Whenever he talks to them, he looks at me. Maybe its becuase I'm looking at him, or maybe he likes me?      This is me and his relationship:   We sit next to eachother and he always tells me these lame jokes! But I think they are so cute! On the other side of me is one of my friends, and in front of me is one f my best friends. Whenever I work with them, he is always tapping me on the shoulder and saying "We are supposed to work together" and he talks fast when he talks to me.      When he talks to the other girls he does the same thing!      UHGG! I am so confused! Does he like me?

20071016141641AAfsW2v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	He...always turns up early when I am there. and finds excuses for me to talk to him like silly questions or asks other people to get me so he can ask me something. He brushes past my *** all the time and tells me personal things, like the other day he was in a bad mood and i said 'smile' and he was like 'nope' and i made a joke and he smiled and laughed. But he told me why he was in a bad mood an it was to do with his home life etc, i dont think he would've told just anyone about it. He helps me out all the time and always makes me laugh and always looks at me in the eyes and smiles. but the other day another guy at work said that the guy i like had 'got laid' and thats why he was so happy, but then another person said that the guy who told me this likes me too.  What do u think?? Is he a flirt or does he like me? I feel he makes excuses to be near me all the time and I'm unsure what to do.
20071016155126AAlocwC	Family & Relationships;Family	Esta pregunta es para los que me quieran ayudar y no para los que busquen puntos. ok?	Bueno alli va. Soy una persona madura, responsable y de trabajo estable. He tenido algunas enamoradas y ninguna me ha convencido para pasar con ella el resto de mis dias. Tal vez el problema sea yo o Dios asi lo quiere. Pero de lo que estoy seguro es de tener un hijo ya sea de forma natural previo acuerdo con la otra parte o adoptandolo, el caso es que quiero amar, criar, proteger y formar a alguien que le sirva a esta sociedad, dedicarle mi vida y mi tiempo. Quiziera saber si es necesario esperar hasta que llegue mi media naranja que pueden ser a?os no lo se, o si ya puedo formar mi famila de a dos (yo y mi hijo). Bye

20070917140047AANy9kv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Hold on or let go?	I was with my boyfriend for a year, but I feel like I've known him forever.  We broke it off less than a week ago when he left for university. We were both devastated... we love each other so much. During my year with him, I got a lot of signs- some personal, and some spiritual- that he was going to be an important person in my life. Now that he left, we are still very in love, but know that we should move on because we'll only see each other a few times a year. We're free to see others (and I know he probably will, now that he's starting a new life in a crowd where he "fits in" more) but I really get the feeling that there's not another one like him... I'm afraid that if he stays close in my heart, and I see him frequently when he's back, I'll be going through the same "withdrawal" each time he leaves. At the same time, I don't want to lose him... I'm so torn, it's impossible. Assuming our feelings towards each other don't change, how close should I keep him to my heart?

I've moved back out of state to stay with my family while he's gone, and ever since I left, he's been a jerk.  He won't return my phone calls, tells me I call him too much (twice a day). He thinks I'm being rude to him when I say he's being a jerk and that he needs to start responding to my text messages and phone calls. He is always watching TV or involved in something else when I want to talk to him. It seems like he's just acting like normal everyday, even though next week I won't be able to talk to him for three months. Doesn't he understand that I miss him? Doesn't he know that I want to talk to him as much as I can before he leaves? He will hang up on me if I say anything about it on the phone and he'll send me a text saying "I love you, goodnight, talk to you tomorrow." What is wrong???

Well recently during a movie we were watching we kissed.  Now we're talking all the time and just love being with each other.  He gets all jealous when he sees me talking to other guys and everything.  So my question is, is the age too different and is it wrong?  I really, really like him too.

20070930090707AAlhyhB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? (continued)?	Okay so I followed some of the people's advice and i ignored them. But they totally noticed and the next thing I know girl1 is telling me to ignore another guy(boy3). Turns out she has two crushes!!!!!! So what else can I do but agree. She is my best friend and is really nice. She deserves the best. So after like a week I see boy2, boy3, and girl1. Boy2 and boy3 kept looking at me probably expecting me to talk to them but I ignored them. After girl1 left i forgot about the whole ignore them thing and i really talked to boy2 and boy3 alot!!!! To tell you the truth we kinda bonded. Boy2 was so nice he let me use his ipod. He made me listen to this song called I'm Missin' You Like Crazy(i think that's the title) that made me sad cuz it reminded me of an ex-love. He noticed and just stared at me in like a concerned way. Girl1 found out everything about the way boy2 and boy3 stared and talked to me and she just stared at me when I told her I forgot. HELP ME!    Thx to people who answered!!!!!

So, mostly I'll look at him, and he'll look at me. Sometimes when I walk out of my class, he will stare at me.  Whenever I'm walking in the halls, he'll go on my side and walk in front of me. And once, I saw him at my tennis club, and it seemed as if he was trying to impress me. I cant get over him, because I'm deeply in love with him.      In youre opinion, does he like me?      Thanks, im so confused.

20081011142609AAczSt5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I ran into my new boss at a porn shop - I’m horrified - what should I say?	This is embarrassing.  I called an old friend of mine & asked him for a job.  He said yes.  He’s a hairstylist & he’s married.  I should be starting at the salon next week.  My husband & I went to a porn shop by my house (not at all a regular outing for us) & as we were exiting the store my friend (new boss) & his wife were entering.  He saw me & instead of coming into the shop he turned around & hid by a wall outside.  We were exiting/entering at the same exact time. His wife looked confused & asked what he was doing.  I’ve only met her once & it was a long time ago so I’m sure she didn’t recognize me & didn’t know why he was hiding.  I’m so freaking embarrassed.  Should I saying something funny about it when I start work or should I just pretend I didn’t see him either?  It was kinda obvious that we both saw each other.
20081106182840AAzMsY1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get over being angry at my husband?	I have been married for 11 years- We started out so happy- We had fun together and were best friends- We married in our mid 20's and still had some growing up to do. I grew up faster than he did, one of us had to- We had a wonderful daughter- my husband kept drinking and acting like he was 20 and in college. We went through hell, but he finally quit drinking and has not had a drink in years!!  I am so happy and pround of him for controlling this! However, I have lost myself in all of this- I had to become his mother- I had to take on all of the responibily- He could not and still cannot handle it. I completely changed who I was to help him- I lost some close friends during all of this because they drink and he cannot be around this- The biggest problem is that we have drifted so far apart I do not even know who he is- We used to be wonderful friends, now I do not even really like him- He is very selfish and only worries about what he needs- I am so far down on his priority list- He NEVER does anything special for me- I am so angry with him that I do not want to do anything for him- He has never thanked me or shown any gratitude for what I went though with him. There is NO romance in our lives-    How do I let go of my anger- I have told him all of this but he doesn't want to deal with it- I see us heading for a divorce soon-- We tried a counsler- he quit wanting to go when he was told he was selfish- Has anyone else faced these challenges?  What did you do- I would appreciate any suggestions to help me save my marriage. Thanks!

The guy is an American living in America at the time. I was seeing someone else before . I pursued a friendship with the guy in question. The guy i am talking about says he loves me and wants to marry me. I believe things were going too fast.       The guy moved from The USA to get work in Nigeria..which i was a bit cautious about now in hindsight. The guy had work in Nigeria. The work cam and went and he didn't get any money. So from August the guy asked me to send him money. "Silly me", I sent him money off and on every fortnight when i could do it. I started in August 2007 and concluded february 2008. I am determined atht i am not going to send him anymore money.       I even think that him and I cannot have a realtionship. I guess i am doing everything wrong.

20080130143739AAL6ugL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he ignore me?	This guy never talks to me for a couple weeks whenever he gets a new girlfriend&i have no idea why. He has told me he loves me twice&always says he thinks about me all the time&stuff like that, i feel the exact same way about him. However we know we cant have a real relationship because we live so far from each other (thats why he has another gf).   He always tells me he likes me a lot/loves me& wants me to be happy, but im confused because he ignores me when he first gets a new gf....... if he cares for me so much, why ignore me?It really upsets me that he does this!! could it be that he knows he likes me so he tries to avoid me so he can get to like his girlfriend or something?   I really wish we lived closer together& we will see each other again this summer.   What do i do about it& why is he ignoring me?He got another gf about a week and has not been talking to me since. I IM him and he doesnt reply. Why is he doing this?   No rude comments please&sorry if this is confusing! Thanks!

Miren,   no soy un pervertido ni nada, simplemente quiziera tener relaciones con una amiga que me gusta; lo normal es que fueramos novios, pero ella ya tiene novio desde hace 2 a?os y si bien deja que la visite, la piropee, me dice que soy el unico que la visita en el locutorio de telefonos y ya tenemos confianza, siento que le estoy si es que ya le gusto,  teniendo en cuenta que soy mucho mas guapo que su novio, ella misma me lo ha dicho indirectamente o asi crei entenderlo. Ya tenemos confianza, hasta ella me habla con jergas que solo  se hablan entre amigos intimos.

20071126123637AATbE8P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He is worried about scaring me off?	My bf and I have been together about 6 months. He tells me that he is really really soppy about me, and very early on kept saying that he likes me lots and lots and lots and lots. He brings up the subject of marriage a lot (not specifically about me and him, just how it'd be nice one day) and talks about future years and things we will do together. He tells me he wants tohug me forever and that I make him really happy etc, and then he said he was worried he might scare me off by being too soppy with me. I said I was soppy too, and he said don't say it if you don't mean it. Thing is, I'd already told him once that I loved him, he didn't say it back, but started getting a lot more open andhappy and sweet and clingy with me. I don't get it. So if he doesn't love me, why is he worried of scaring me off by being too soppy, especially when I told him I love him. When I say nice things to him, he seems to question it, and thinks I am lying. Why is he like this?

20080220222422AAo08w6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this girl?	Over the past five months I became friends with this girl in my physics class. She always made an effort to talk to me and be nice, and even made me a cd for me after she asked me if I liked a band. She also then copied notes for me and asked me my number so we could study together. When we got done studying and I was walking to my car she stopped and picked me up and we talked in her car. We also went and got coffee at school the next day after she waited a few mins for me to finish our exam. She then later dropped out of her lab project group to be in mine after I couldn't get in hers. She then asked me to goto church with her sometimes, and we've studied together outside of school a few times. In passing one time she said didn't want a relationship when talking about this guy from church that called her...we've been hanging out for a few months now at her house or going out to other places. I usually ask her to go places, but she does sometimes too.

We talk about everything, she laughs every 2 seconds. I sometimes touch her feet with mine under the desks and she play along sometimes but other times she wont but if i tell her come on:P she doesnt mind.      She told me twice that she ate at this restaurant and its really delicious. She said we should go eat there together and chill cuz we never do outside of school.      We were talking about the other stupid guys in the school and she said i like you you're not like the others you're not weird. It didnt sound like love. Also on the phone one time shes like I like you im like yaa me too but that might be cause i was making her laugh.      Does she like me? I mean shes rlly pretty and im just average looking how could she like me? We're 16 by the way      The thing is a lot of times when I call her cell, she wont pick up and just last night I called her like 5 times in a row, she didnt pick up then she just closed her cell when i was calling. And when she sais I like you whenever I ask "do you like so and so guy" shes like yeah hes pretty nice...so its not just me to whom she sais she likes.Also shes like this summer we'll go on a lot of adventures together:P bla bla bla But then I saw she was playing scrabble in class with another guy..The thing is that shes too "nice". She's never bitchy, she almost never gets pissed. She's a nice person so maybe that's why she told me she likes me?

So, he knew i still had MAJOR feelings for him but it seemed as if he took that for advantage and i felt he was going to piss me off. Turnabout [ school dance ] was around the corner and i could not attend. We had plans to go together but due to our break up he still decided to go. I found out he was all over his ex-crush at the dance & even before that he constantly flirts with her during school. Which made me mad of course however i did not bring it to his attention because from my understanding we were not together. Later on i found myself someone to flirt with, little did i know i would catch feelings [ for this junior that goes to my school ]. I sat on his lap [ wasn't a biq deal ] & somehow it got back to my ex. we started arguing & fighting... then he said that he loved me & meant it. im so confused because i do still like him but i also have feelings for the junior....

Im 23 years old, graduated from college a year ago and have stuck around here in ohio since then. Unable to find a job i decided i waited long enough and am moving to Maryland (suburb of Baltimore). I'm excited but also really nervous because i have so many wonderful friends here and i am moving somewhere where i dont really know anyone. I never really had a problem meeting people but im still nervous because what if i dont make any friends and things. This is definitly the first time in my life i've done anything like this cause even when i was in school i was only 30 mins from home. This on the other hand is 8 hours away! Its gonna be a huge change for me. Im very excited but also very nervous.    Any advice? anyone ever gone though a similar situation?
20081014163804AACB6IB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl is way out of my league and there is no way she likes me,right?	   there is this girl i work with who is the most Absolutely beautiful girl i have ever seen. She is puerto rican. The first day we worked together we got along great and made each other laugh alllll day. Ever since then we have been getting closer and closer. Some other people we work with told me she likes me. But then she told me that some people were spreading rumors so i think that means she doesn't like me. One day i was like okay, im not gonna talk to her and see if she even notices and after 15 mins she ran over to me and was like "are you mad at me?" Then i was like okay if she asks me if i have a gf then she likes me, well she didn't but her friend asked me. one person keeps telling me that this girl and i act like we are in love and that she follows me around like a puppy. I dont think this is true. but who knows. anyways i like her but im dont want to make work awkward by telling her and her not liking me like that. what should i do? is there a way to find out for sure?

20071030164802AAZbMSZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there anything wrong with my self esteem?	Background story: when I was at school.. kids made fun of me by calling me ugly every time I passed by someone. Sometimes guys would get other people to tell me that "he likes you" which was obviously a joke, to make fun of me and my apparent 'ugliness.' Guys would ask me out as a joke and then say "i was joking, nobody would want to go out with an ugly #%@!#! like you".      Now at 21 years of age, I don't BELIEVE I am ugly. But when someone asks me out for a date, I either insult them and say that I'm not amused by the joke, or ignore them completely. In short, I am beginning to believe anyone who asks me for a date is trying to make fun of me. Why did these events at childhood have such a profound impact on me? What can I do to improve my attitude? Because I don't enjoy being rude to anyone actually sincere.      While thinking about or answering my question(s), please remember: insight is helpful, rude remarks are not. Not just to me, but other fellow users as well. Thank you

20071102223123AAn8LC0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need lots of answers,Have I completely lost her forever?	A month and a half ago I broke up with my g/f bc I needed to sort out my life. For 2 weeks she said nothing but that I didnt care bc if I did I wouldnt take the break up so easily and there was no way I was ever in love with her. So I was mad and went out and hooked up with a random girl. Big mistake. The last email I got from my ex 2 weeks ago said she didnt want things to end with us hating each other but thats what we got and the hurtful things she said were said out of not knowing how to handle things. She said clearly I was moving on and she was trying to do the same...I miss her, I realize I messed up, I want her back or at least a friendship...Is it too soon to contact or think shes still angry?

20071106131409AAtGgPQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex cheated on me 6 months ago, now she says she still has feelings for me.?	me n my ex went out for 2 years before a mutual break up, after which we decided we still loved eath other to pieces n we gave it another go well 3 months later she cheated on me and we broke up and it literally broke my heart, i tried to reason with her that i could forgive as i adored her but to no avail. 5 days ago she texts me out of the blue saying she still regrets what she did and still thinks about me. i say lets meet up and we had a great time with some food and a few drinks. the next day i say that i had a nice time and ask her why she text me that and she says she still has feelings for me n misses me, i replied saying i still felt the same but there was nothing back untill she text me earlier on about a random tv program which she wouldnt normally do. Now the big question is, do i tell her i still harbour some very big feelings towards her and would love to spend the rest of my life with her, or at least give it another go, as i am willing to put my heart on the line again?

I know there are tons of questions out there like this one....but I just wanted your opinion of the situation.   Theres this guy whos in one of my classes. Thats the only time I see him. An hour a day. We used to be lab partners and he would always joke around with me and in a fun way "make fun of me" (not in a mean or hurtfull way) and we had alot of fun. But it's a new semester and so we aren't science partners. But we sit across from each other and sometimes during class discussions I'll notice he's looking at me and I'll look back at him and smile. He then smiles back or jokingly acts like I should pay attention. And then sometimes I'll tease him that he must be bored cause he just walks around. And then he jokingly says " Cause I'm just that cool" then he complimented me on my new haircut. He's really cute and I think I may like him...but do you think he is flirting with me and that he likes me too?   BTW i'm 14 and a freshman.   No stupid yes or no answers please!   ~Cutie Blonde

20071206150917AA1ZVgn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So what to do???	Ok, so I've been friends with this girl for about 4 years now and we dated for about 8 months back when we first knew each other.  We both dated other people, but about 7 months ago we were both single again and started talking regularly. She asked me how I felt about her a few days ago. I told her how I really felt (I do want a relationship with her again) and then I asked her the same question, only problem is she didn't want to answer. So I let it be and now I'm really questioning myself on whether she feels the same about me or not. I think she does, but she just doesn't want a relationship yet. She is kind of shy and doesn't like to put her feelings on the line for fear of getting hurt. But two days ago I found out that she's friends again with her ex. She said they're only friends and she doesn't having feelings for him, but I know he has feelings for her and this bothers me. Since she started talking to him I feel like she doesn't care much anymore. What should I do?

I'm coming to the conclusion that women in my town won't date you unless you're a prick, loser or druggie.       What do women look for in a guy? I don't think being nice is a very positive attribute in your teenage years, is it?

20080208190946AAJ77os	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im afraid of girls?	i used to be very ugly and weak and had always been put down by other boys in school whenever i tried to talk to girls. i used to be 270 and pimply and hideous. now ive lost weight, face cleared up and look like a man. but whenever a girl talks to me, i feel very undeserving and try my hardest to avoid them. i am not sure what to do, i mean damn, i live in austin! supposed to be the best city for singles. i am very depressed, some think im gay because i dont talk to girls. for good reason though because even when i try to talk to girls, i say the STUPIDEST THINGS. like yesterday, i was at the bustop. there was an average looking girl. the bus pulls up and makes a weird noise. just then she tries to say something and i blurt out "ah man that BUS is BUSTED!" she looked and grinned and worked her way to the back of the bus away from me. im actually extremely funny and quick witted with inuendos. but when it comes to girls, i just feel hermitted and unwanted. im VERY SHY NOW! wat do i do?
20080208162056AAJ3o6s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Do I Say...?	I met this girl friend of mine in a club back then. We spend time in the club chatting, drinking and dancing. After that, I took her to my pad and we had sex. Months after that, we became good friends but what I didn't know is that she treats me more than that. She feels that I'm his boyfriend. Everytime we go out, she always clings to my arms and out of nowhere, she just kisses me. Well I can't pick up girls in the clubs because she's always clinging to me. She also calls me day and night and even introduces me to her other girl friends like I'm his bf when in fact, I'm not. How do I say to her that I don't love her romantically? That I only love her as a friend without hurting her feelings?

I am still married, tho, but going through a divorce, as m yboyfriend is also.   We met in July and he started staying overnight and just never left.  I do enjoy this, as he still pays rent to his roomate (to which he is never there)  but i have 2 kids, that absolutely adore him, but i just want him to understand that i need my own space.  When i have mentioned to him about just staying a couple nights a week he got angry and thought that i was trying to break up iwth him.  I explained to him that wasnt the case and i just dropped it.  He sais he cant sleep without me there.   In a way i love this, becuase is great compared to what i had before and i love that he wants to be with me all the time, but i just dont know how to get him to understand.  I feel as though he wants to be with me all the time because he thinks if hes not "watching" me tthat i will look elsewhere. That isnt the case tho.  Please help me?

20080608140510AAdqDbU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make her... I mean persuade to fall for me?	Yes, yes, I know you can't make anybody fall in love with you. Her interest in me is there, I just need to intensify it, so how do I subtly persuade her to think i am the one?       Here is a background on her, my observations might be offensive, but it might help people in helping me:      - Very attractive, has a lot of guys after her   - Very busy, works 9-5 mon-fri   - Goes clubbing with her female friends on weekends   - Has had her heart broken (possibly more than once), she doesn't trust guys anymore   - Very classy, dresses very provocative, and she is rich   - Very cool, when I first spoke to her, we immediately clicked and talked for like 2 hrs in a 3 hour class.   - 21 years old.      She is very outgoing, and loves talking, but tries to suppress her feelings because she is shy/hurt and is playing hard to get.      I'll move on if this doesn't go anywhere, but I'd like to try, how do I deal with her. I don't really want to show my romantic side, because that might freak her out.. what do I do?

20080708011056AAS6g4s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	19 year old and a 15 year old dating?	Okay, I'm 19 and I'm with a girl who's 16 in Febuary.      I just want to know what you guys think about me dating her.. do you feel that it's wrong? Why?      Me and her get a lot of harrassment and stuff and I've been called a pedophile before.. it hurts but I really do care for her and I know she cares for me too.      I met her about 8 months ago, and 2 or 3 months ago I started becoming closer to her and started to have feelings for her as more than a friend. A few days ago I finally got the courage to ask her out and she said yes.      It's not like we're having sex, she wants to wait until marriage before she loses her virginity and I'm not someone who needs to have sex to be happy so I'm fine with it.      She's also kind of mature for her age and I'm kind of immature for mine.      I don't want to keep babling on but okay.   What do you guys think of our relationship?
20080708064652AAUuAtL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any ideas on what i can do??	So i like this girl. And we REALLY know each other.   Well im pretty sure she likes me but is afraid to acctually tell me becouse if something ever goes wrong it wont be the same. Anyways here are some of the things we do.   We talk everyday on the phone for more than 2 hours or 1 at least.   She never wants to hang up, weather i accidently woke her up, or shes washing dishes, watering the grass, removing her make up. She wont hang up even if i ask if she wants to talk when shes done she says " Nooooo.." like with a begging tone.   Shes been really flirty these 2 or 3 times weve hang out for more than 1 hour.   She was really flirty on the theater the day we whent. But her younger bro came along and his 2 little cousins..It wasn't a porblem either way it was pretty fun.   She always tells me, " I like to argue with you " but playfully not real.   She has more patience with me than anyone Else, And she has small patience even with her 2 best friends.      Its pretty clear she likes me..But i think shes..

Ive been with my bf for 14 months and im 19 now,the relationship between me and him has been decent.But theres tension with his mom with everyone.supposedly she likes me, but i can only go over once or twice a week to their house & i have to say hi first and she doesnt seem to like me much, but my bf tells me that she does & trust me, all my aunts and family parents like me. Everytime i go to their house, its a war zone with the mom, brother and sometimes my bf.ive tried to be supportive, but the mom always says she is gonna die of stress bcuz of her kids, and cuz of this & she admits that his ex-gf gave her stress and that and thats given me stress cuz im the new gf. my bf is a great guy, he is faithful, trustful, honest, and gives his best effort to me in the relationship, but the mom is pullin me away from him. ive tried avoiding goin to their house, but theres limited things to do outside durin the winter & little money. im confused and dont kno what i should do...
20080709000221AA6nhPf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is it CHEATING?	Sometimes my boyfriend's not always available. I do have a lot of guy friends though who are easy to talk to, cute, and fun to be around. I usually flirt with them and they flirt too, but they all know that I'm in a relationship. I'll call one just to talk or go see movies with another or make out with another, all just for fun. It's never anything serious.      My bf tends to be the jealous type and he gets mad but i never considered any of it cheating because I wasn't trying to hurt him or leave him. I just like to flirt.       So where is the line? When does the fun end and cheating begin?       I realize its probably different for everyone but i want some individual opinions. What counts as cheating?

We have hooked up in the past off & on  & always looked for each other out at the bars since we were 21, regardless of who we were with. In the last year I fell in that rut that most guys fall into. I love her very much and  still very attracted to her, but took her for granted & got use to the relationship. After a month we still pretty much talk, text, do the dinner movie thing or just have lunch. She called me one night for a "sleep over" but since then she says no more cause it makes things complicated. Anytime I bring "us" up she won't talk about it & says she doesn't want to lead me on even though we talk or hangout almost everyday. She had one date,didnt like it. When I leave its followed by a hug & a kiss on the cheek or  something. She still has our pics up. What does she want?
20080709194422AAWUsY5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get your ex-boyfriend to stop texting you?	ok, so my ex and i broke up a few days ago... we said we wanted to stay friends and it was not a mean, nasty breakup or anything.... but part of the reason i broke up with him is because he texts me annoying things 24/7 just to make small talk and talk even if were talking about nothing.. and when he runs out of stuff he goes "so wat r u doing now?" and "sooo... wat to talk about" and he says it in that lazy style where everything is spelled wrong and its just really ANNOYING! lol, oh my goodness, how do i get him to leave me alone without hurting his feelings?

20080818012428AAKArcV	Family & Relationships;Friends	There's this girl and she makes me feel like a no-one. What should I do?	So when I came to this school (from another school) I made friends with this gang of girls. There were 3 of them. 2 that were really nice but there was 1 that kept making me feel like a no-one. She was really bosy and controlled my life. She tried to take the other 2 girls away from me and do deliberate nasty things to me. After 1 year, her parents jobs moved and she had to move 2 france. Her parents jobs stay there for a year and a half then they will move back. Since she's been gone, its been so good! I've been so free and my friendship with the other 2 girls has been really strong. But then last week, she came back for a visit. She's here for a week and is here right now. Now that she is here - my 2 other friends have totally ignored me and won't speak or come near me. It's like they don't know me. The girl has been taking them away and the 2 girls do EVERYTHING she does. Its really got 2 me cuz now I have no friends. I hate her so much. Has anyone been in this situation before? PLEASE HELP! Thanks!

20080924171859AAtnzfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Creepy guy...keeps calling me?	So two weeks ago, I met this guy. I was sitting in a classroom and he sat right behind me. He kept telling me how pretty I was, and asked me for my phone number and myspace address (may sound sweet, but it was EXTREMELY CREEPY). I told him no about ten times - yea, he begged me that many times! After class ended, I was on my way out of the building when he said "haha, i got your number!" He stayed after class and looked through a stack of emergency forms to get it! Creepy! Now, he calls and texts me ALL THE TIME! And his friend calls me too! They leave me voicemail messages saying things like "I'm practically banging my head on the wall...I can't wait to see you again!" He is such as stalker! I feel like I'm going to wake up one day and he'll be right in front of me; that's how creeped out I am. I've told him to stop calling me several times. ): Any suggestions on what I should do?

I know this is a wierd question because there are different answers in different cultures.

It is real.It gives you strength and grows beyond you,to bolster your beloved.   You are warmed by his presence,even when he is away.   Miles do not separate you. You want him near.But near or far,   you know he is yours and you can wait.

20081119112424AAfaoBe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is he thinking really?	I don't understand my friend. We're exes but still close, kinda back together but not really. We just like each other but don't really do anything about it? We hang out a lot... But it's not the same <333333333 bf/gf type as it was before. And we argue over the past sometimes, I asked him isn't he's tired of that, and he said kind of.       So I try to break up with him forever and no more contact. But he won't let me.... I just need his agreeing or approval that he won't contact anymore and he's just like "DISAGREE.... why are you doing this to me? Don't leave me, what did I do wrong?" etc etc. And I explain I don't make him happy, he's not happy, what's the point, why can't we break up. He literally just ignores and won't respond or have the conversation with me.      I think it just means he doesn't want to lose me as a friend... When I try to suggest should we just be friends, he says "we're not." So what's the deal? If we're not totally bf/gf then what does he want or what is he doing? =/

I mean, he's not shy with everyone else, just with me, so i don't know if that counts as being shy? we make a lot of eye contact and we only really have the courage to speak to one another when we have a small, open opportunity lol but we used to laugh and smile with eachother all the time, and now it's different. i really do want to get to know him. I'm thinking about telling him how i feel, and try to be brave =) but i don't want to scare him off or anything, and i don't know for sure if he likes me. do you think i should ? and if so, how ? How would you want to be told ? Thank you !!

20090304223236AAMG1e6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	There's a girl I really like. Actually I don't know her yet. But I find she's sweet and stunning.?	I always purposely walk by her shop that she work.   It's been 2 months plus and my intention is try to make her notice me.   And 2 days ago, she finally did,   for the first time she take a look at me,   this look had plant a huge impact on me and I was preparing to give   something to her the next day, which is today.   The content of the gift is 2 tracks of my song that I wrote complete with   full arrangement, which I intent to give it to her.   But as I walk towards her shop today and she was standing outside and   were talking to her neighbor colleagues and I'm afraid that she couldn't be   able to entertain me, I got no choice but to walk pass her and will try another attempt tomorrow, ( to pass the gift )   but the moment I walk pass her, this time she give me yet another look   and it seems sincere with a thought of guessing plus a feel of mild shyness.   I'm so too overwhelmed by that look and she totally swept off my feet.   Anyway, the guessing feeling of her towards me, is that she actually don't know   that I can converse in her language ( dialect ).   As I'm a mixed and I had a lil tan skin complexion and not many people will   know I can speak their language.   So the questions is........................,   given all of this considerable hints,   will you all encourage me to make that move ( about the gift ),   plus, what can I talk to her,   and what's the additional suggestion that you all will encourage me to do ?   I really don't wanna give up this girl.   Thanx to everyone in advance, please give me some sound advice,   I really need this.

20090304224649AAfZ1SN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys what would you do if a girl asked you this?	I am still trying to decide if I should ask this guy to prom. If you want more info, you can read my previous question. Anyway, is it weird for a girl to ask a guy to prom? I was asking some of my friends and they thought that it should be the other way around, but it can't be. We are both sophomores and we go to different high schools. The only reason I can go to prom is because my schooling is online and there aren't enough students so it's gonna be an all grades prom. Do guys like when girls ask them out? If so, should I say that we could go as friends? Please help me. I really need good advice. Thanks!

20090111140332AAZCiMW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I just want to know, Is my poem any good? ?	I don't really want to publish it, just wanted to know if it was good or not. You can use it if you want.            To what do we owe   These unaccounted visits   Of misfortune?   They live in time   Crawling through its ripples    Until it comes and clings   And sucks out your life   Like a starved leech.   It kills your mind   Your heart   Your soul   Why then   Do some of us    Overcome misfortune?   While others sit and get swallowed   By an unforgiving world?   I am being swallowed,   And am now up to my knees   In the black muck we call life   With nothing to cling on to   But my hopes and dreams.   But even those are fading!   For I have seen life’s true ugliness.   It lives in money.   Those who have it, cling to it   Like a life raft   Until the day they die.   The rest of us live without it   Swimming through that great black ocean   For all of our lives   Until we realize that we will never find it.    Only the small   Small   Small   Amount of people realize.   That that they can build a boat   Together.

I was just wondering if you know the definition of a "retard".  I think that is exactly how you put it when you answered a question about what makes you mad on here?   Being 17 yrs. old, you should have graduated or will be graduating this year, so will you explain what kind of person a retard is.    I know you would not be referring to someone like my little sister who is mentally retarded.  I prefer to call it mentally challenged or handicapped.   Grow up, and please have some respect.
20090305024336AAIUV4F	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am i being paranoid, is my partner going off me?	I have been in a relationship with my partner for a good 9-10 months. There was teething problems as i felt weird about his ex wife going to his when he wasnt with me and being her shoulder to cry on (She cheated on him and walked out, got pregnant with the guy near enough straight away and shes still with the guy she left him for). Her parents still go to his as he is their care of address as they live on a boat..    Since jan he has reakoned that he was filing for a divorce (been split from his ex wife for 3-4 years now). Apparently at first his ex wife reackoned she would pay the full amount towards the divorce, then half after my partner got a quote from a solicitor and now nothing because shes pregnant (has been for 8 months bare in mind). My partner makes out he will do it anyhow but spends all his money on other things.  He kept saying that in summer that we could move in together and suggesting it i.e. by saying "dont buy anything new for your house as i have it".  The other night i asked out straight about him wanting to move in with him and he has now changed it to his idea of me moving into his area rather than move in with him. I am so confussed and my mind is wondering over time.  His exwife is visiting and crying on his shoulder again. I noticed a couple of weekends ago when i stayed at his, he asked me to sort something on the computer upstairs.. then his ex wifes parents came round and it felt like he gave me an excuse so i would be out the way. I made a point that i was there by nipping down stairs.. and out the front door to have a ***, only then he made a point of saying they was there.
20090304224334AATd1Gk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do some women pick fights with their significant others to keep the relationship 'interesting'?	Disclaimer:  Ok, I realize that this is a very generalistic question and that not all women are going to engage in this act.       This was brought up during a conversation I had and I would like some further insight.  I can't stand arguing with my significant other (well, when I had one anyway). I find that the energy could be used towards other things.  Now, I'm hearing another theory that some women do so to get attention.  WHY on earth would you some women do that to guys?  Is that not playing some weird manipulation or head game?  I don't think the average woman fully understands how much us guys HATE that crap!!  There are so many other ways that you beautiful creatures could get our attention!  You have to resort to using one of the most negative methods?  HOLY CRAP! C'mon!  That's just messed up!       Seriously!  It makes me want to almost join a freakin' monastery or some thin'!  How many times do we have to say "DON"T PLAY MIND GAMES WITH GUYS!"? It's not that we're not equipped (contrary to what some of you trite and bitter females may think) it's just that we find that's WAY too much effort because almost 99% of the time we end up on the couch with the family pet anyway!  If those women spent less effort pissing us off, then maybe we'd be able to have the energy to remember those important dates that you want us to remember!!       I could go on about this but I'm just so beyond annoyed by this.  Thanks for letting me rant.  Look, I'm honestly not trying to piss the ladies off, I'm not, I just find such conduct so deceiving and underhanded, it's not wonder our genders have such trouble communicating. Someone, please give me some hopeful insight.
20090304221435AATNJ5G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: which of these guys would u pick?	ok girls u could get ANY of these guys, who would u chose? (based on people i know)      1. the bad boy, he is popular and has lots of friends. skates, surfs, drinks, partys, smokes weed (not regularly) and is a 'lots of fun'. many people think he is a total a$$hole but then again many think he is awesome and funny. has had many g/fs.      2. the geeky-ish guy, likes comics and video games. is funny and has plenty of friends. people can make fun of him but he is cute, nice and  very funny. not really into partying and not a ladies-man.      3. this guy is athletic, happy, has plenty of friends but immature. still acts like he is in primary school and makes silly jokes but is nice. bad acne. doesnt mind a party.      4. this guy is quiet and reserved around others but with friends is talkative and happy. cute but not very outgoing. hasnt had a gf and doesnt really party but likes to have fun. bit of a wallflower.       these r based on some guys i know so i was wondering which one u girls would choose. it would b better if u knew the guys i was reffering 2 but obviously u cant so this is the best i could do.   thanks!

20090304180855AASP60g	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Marry my love of follow my dreams?	My fiance and I are very much in love. We are both about to graduate from college (May), and will continue through graduate school. The thing is, he wants to get his masters and THEN go to medical school. It sounds great, but I have worries. He will spend 3 years in his masters program (Biochemistry), then 4 years of medical school, and a minimum of 4 years of residency after that. I will finish my PhD in 4 years and want to start a family and settle down as soon as I can. I've always imagined myself getting pregnant for the first time while I finish the PhD. With his 11+ years of school left, where does our family come in? I can't have a baby and continue my career without his help, which he won't be able to fully give until med school and residency are complete. He won't be able to study with a baby crying, nor be a father 100%. On top of that, we'd be stuck living wherever he gets accepted to medical school. I don't want my children in a dangerous city and I also want to be able to further my own career without having to relocate whenever his education calls for it.    I feel like he is my soulmate, we truly are perfect for eachother. The problem is we both have too many dreams we want to follow! Should I marry him and give up my life to follow his? I don't even want my dreams if he's not in them, but I do want children as soon as I can support them. I am 22 and he is 34. I'd be in my mid to late 30's before I have them and he'd be almost 50 if we follow his plan! My parents were in their early 40's when I was born and my mother is already passed and my father is in very poor health, I want to see my kids graduate college.    Do you think we want too different of things for our future to work out?   We've talked about it but he has never changed his plans and neither have I, it's almost like we both ignore the elephant in the room. I could never ask him to give up his dream of being a doctor, but can I give up my dream of being a mother? And where do I draw the line with my career goals needing to be met?

20090305000658AARu2Yl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would he talk in this way? what?	let me start by saying his work has been slow, I wrk and pay half the bills. even on part time he stil would have money to pay his part. He said some really heartless things to me. he was rambling on about how its only good for me when I want it. how i don't do enough round the house, scolded me bc i don't get up and have coffee in morn with him.taunting me. he'd been drinking all day. called me a bi^%h , snapping his finger saying get up and make me breakfast in the morn. P wrk and do my best round the house and as a lover, and i thought we had an understanding of each-es individuality and space, but 2 night he just clicked.i didn't do anything im aware of to start the fight. I defended my self saying this isn't ur ex ur talking to and i called him a bit7h back. told him im not ur hore i pay my way here too. he finally laid down after i stop defending myself and told him shut up and go to bed. of course he mumbled the same sh7t in bed till he fell asleep. he gave my dog a hard time he choked him, i didn't see him do it but i heard him gasping for air. i challenged him about that naturally he lied till he seen i knew the truth, but still didn't admit.

20090305001744AA7RYKS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: Would you date a guy thats shorter than you ?	Im only about 5'8. Which isnt very tall for a guy.

20090305021300AAWiA6Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just wanted some opinions... when is/isn't the right time to please your girlfriend sexually? And in what ways?	I don't mean to sound perverted or too personal, but I just wanted some opinions... I'm 18 and have a girlfriend of about half a year and we fool around sometimes in bed (we havent gotten to the sex stage yet)... As in, I will use my hands to please her sexually... I usually ask her before I reach down if it is ok and what she wants, and she'll say yes, or I sometimes will know she wants to by the way she acts, and when I feel stupid asking all the time. I figure that she'll say no when I get near there if she doesn't want me to. But how can I know if and when she'll want me to go further? And do the whole oral sex thing? I don't want to ask because I think it'll put her off or she'll be disgusted. I don't expect her to return the favor (she never does anyway with what we do now... I think she probably feels like she'd be being slutty if she returned the favor, because she hears of slutty little girls running around giving 'wristies' all the time and she despises them)... I just want to explore sexually and try these things, but I never know when the right time is or how to go about it. I just asked "is this ok?" all the other times I tried things, but this just seems too extreme, like it's too much of a touchy subject (excuse the pun).

20090305024243AARdeJj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can men tell when a woman is interested in them??!!?	Im 19 and I like a guy at work, who is much older, but not married. hes about 36. anyways...i like him because hes very kind and shy and soft spoken --- a lot like me!       Ive developed a crush on him, though. about three weeks ago. and i've been glancing at him but not staring. i try not to make it obvious. sometimes though its like when i try to sneak a look up he looks at me at the same time. we just both smile when that happens. ive noticed ive been going out of my way to be near him or making excuses to talk to him. but i try not to overdo it so i dont scare him off.      anyways..im scared now that he knows i like him. usually we just smile and say Hi, how are you? ocassionally...he will ask things like "so you dont go out, do you?" (whatever that means.) i just tell him i dont really party and that im trying to stay focused on school and work. or something.       the other day i wanted to get up the courage to say more than hi. this is the day after i had been going out of my way to talk to him a lot. and right when i was going to prolong the conversation...he did it instead! he asks me when im starting my junior college and i tell him im nervous and hes all "its ok..i know you will do well!" and the other day hes teasing around saying im not allowed to operate this machine and then he made me translate some sign in spanish and when i did hes like "youre cheating" and i denied it and we laughed and he goes "im just kidding..i know you are smart!" then yesterday, i go in this room and then he walks in after im already in there. i say hi and i ask how he is. hes all "hi..im okay...i think im getting..." and i look at him and his face is red! and i go "youre getting...sick? must be from all this rainy cold weather right?" and hes like "yeah" and i told him i hope he feels better.      how can i flirt and do you think he already knows? would he be mad if i asked him out for coffee? :) it would make me happy just to have a conversation with him alone or something.

20081116164836AAA7pVg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get him to like me?	Okay so there is this guy in my class when I go and take lessons every other day.  He is really cute and kind. He is smart in the class and can answer any question the teacher asks even when he was just not paying attention.  He's not so tall about 5'3 or 5'4. For Christmas, each class in the school will perform a holiday song and perform it to the whole entire school.  FYI our class time is only 2 hours.  So for the song there are going to be couples going around.  I am coupled with him. I started to blush while we do our part and smile alot.  He tends to smile alot while doing this.  We don't talk to each other at all. Not even when we are practing our part because we do it with the whole class.  I never say anything to him because I get to shy.  What should I do to get him to like me?  I just wanna see some suggestions but I'm not going to literally do that.
20090305005044AAN5nU9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I cut ties with her? (A quick yes or no will do)?	She is 23 and I am 27. She has hinted at me that she is just recovering from a series of abusive relationships and is intimidated by me.       Yet still, she keeps sending me a whole bunch of mixed signals. I've been chasing her since october and she's made it clear that she's interested in me but at the same time, cannot allow for a romantic relationship to happen between us.       She compliments me, supports me, tells me she loves me, remembers important dates in my life etc. although whenever I get serious about us or try to act sweet to her, she often insults me by saying stuff like 'shut the **** up you player I don't need to hear this ****' then ignores me for days testing to see what I will do to get her back. Then she complains that I don't give her enough attention.       It hurts me to even consider moving on but it's also painful trying to make her mine 'officially.' I'm really sprung up on her she is an amazing chick, but too much of a challenge.      Should I just give up on her or is she worth it in the end?
20090305034842AAm0Ctu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he sound like a player to you (quick yes or no will do)?	This guy has been chasing me since october he is 27 and I am 23. I have a feeling he's a player because he's incredibly smooth with his words, always flirts with me and other girls, found some text messages on his phone saying to some chick, 'hey babe where you been I miss you you can come ride me anytime you want.' he also jokes around saying to me, 'you should get in my pants already. I don't think any more than that.'      but on the other hand:      it's been a long 6 months and I haven't given in yet he is still pursuing me, he remembers important dates in my life, talks to me about absolutely everything and is always listening and looking out out for me, supports me, checks in on me everyday, spent christmas, new years and our birthdays together, talks about our future, traveled down to see me (no we didn't have sex), he says he loves me...       So yeah, this one is a difficult one to figure out but I'm keeping myself on guard and I don't know if he is bad news or not. So does he sound like a player?

20090304223307AABRojQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I do the right thing?	I'm so mad right now. Me and this guy have been "talking" for about a month and  half now. I've realized that he hasn't asked me out, didn't ask me to be his valentine, and we disagree on issues like BOTH OF US PAYING for dates when we go out. like he pays for all of it one time and then i pay for all of it the next time. Well, whenever I would bring it up, which was twice about, if we were going to go out. He would tell me to chill and that i'm impatient. Today on aim I told him that i'm not going to be a side ***** and wait around forever for him to ask me out, LOL yeah i said that. and he said i need to smoke some and calm down. and i told him i was being serious. Well he thinks I like his friend, which isn't true, his friend is fuckin hilarious, but i'm not attracted to him or anything. And i told him that.    Well this sucks, my options were, wait around forever and be a side ***** (not like he has a main one or anything) or tell him bye. And i think I told him bye. Urgh.       It seemed like he didn't know what he wanted and was just wasting my time, but he said if he wanted to stop "talking" to me, he would. But yeah.
20090305005751AAXRKLj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for young chicks - Do you sometime feel you are more like a bird or cat than human ?	N/A
20090305035332AAWqLij	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should I do about this situation?	I am leaving my husband in June and each year for 8 years now, we have gone together on an "adults only" camping trip with all our friends. This was started by his friends but, they became our friends & we all used to go to the bars together (even though he knew them first & worked with some of them). Since our marriage, we don't really go out anymore and I have no friends to speak of so, this gathering is something I have looked forward to every year. Well, this year we will have split only one month before the trip and I would still want to go but, not sure if I should?    Seems like sometimes over the years, couples have split up & then, each one will attend the trip with their "new" boyfriends/girlfriends but, it always seems to make the others feel a bit uncomfortable....you could cut the tension with a knife!       I know neither of us will be bringing along a new companion and so, we would both go on our own but, I don't want to feel stupid & have people asking a bunch of uncomfortable questions.       Would you still go? I know he will go and I would feel like it was totally unfair if I couldn't...not to mention, I look forward to this every year and I will really be just starting my new life and trying to make some friends. Do you think I can still have a good time if we are not together? I also wonder because it is a drinking, tubing weekend and not sure if the alcohol will make things even worse?    Your opinion?
20090218172140AAUO8F0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do...break up or make it work?	okay, im 16 and my boyfriend is18!! we have been together for about 2 weeks now!! we really like each other, and everything is going okay. the only problem is we dont get to see each other that much. since he is older than me, he has a little more freedom...i cant do most of the things that he can do, plus he has a car!! my parents dont know that im with him..and i still dont wanna tell them yet. anyways, i feel like he wants to break up because everytime he wants to see me i cant go or its always some excuse! we have a good relationship, but i have only seen him 1 time since we got together..my heart is telling me to stay with him and try to make it work but my mind is telling me this isnt gonna work!! WHAT SHOULD I DO!!! i need to know now cause i wanna talk to him tonight. and where should we go to hang out!!   THANKS
20090305013447AAeqXfR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship problems...?	Long story short, I've been in a 9 month relationship and I have a chance to break up. I don't know if I ever will again.       I've been talking to my therapist, and she says she doesn't think she's going to change... you see, I'm in a controlling relationship.      I... made a list of pros and cons to staying in a relationship with her.      I just want opinions... so, thanks ahead of time.      Pros to staying:      ? I love her   ? I like being with her a lot of the time   ? I can talk to her      Cons to staying:      ? I don’t think it’s going to change... ever.   ? Sometimes I can’t stand her   ? Sometimes she doesn’t believe me or take me seriously   ? She makes me cry much more often than she makes me laugh   ? She’s manipulative/controlling   ? She makes me feel bad for things I don’t have control over   ? She accuses me of things I’m not doing   ? She generalizes my actions   ? She thinks I work in patterns   ? I feel like **** when I talk to her   ? Almost every time we talk we fight, if not every   ? When I tell her I was considering suicide, she wants me to sympathize for her because she has to be worried about me   ? She doesn’t let me do the things I want to anymore   ? I constantly have to pick between making her happy or making me happy

20090305030742AA956Vu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing boy behavior...can anyone translate from "guy" to "English"?	There's this guy I've been secretly seeing lately (I'm forbidden to see him and his parents don't like our age difference). We're not in a relationship or anything, we just have little dates behind our parents' backs just because it's fun and we enjoy each other's company. So, I tried to plan one of these for this past weekend, but unfortunately he had to cancel because of some scheduling conflicts. He said that he felt badly and would take the reins for the next one (his words: "definitely i'll make it up to you"). Well I hadn't heard from him for a week, so the night before last texted him to say "hi" and asked casually if he still intended to make it up to me. He said "haha quite possibly" and then asked "why, do you have any ideas?". When I said no, he said "ok" and nothing else. Then yesterday I said "yeah, i don't have any realistic ideas, just wonderin if you were gonna keep your promise". No answer. What do you think is texts implied? Is there a chance of this thing still happening? Did I screw it up with what I said?

20081119120720AAVSOIl	Family & Relationships;Friends	"Beauty is only skin deep"...is it really true?	well, I have heard people saying this so many time, but i do not think that it is true. I have this girl in my group, and she is very good looking. She likes to make other girls feel that they are not good looking. I am not very beautiful, but I am confident enough the way I look. She also lied about couple things, and she made me look bad in front of all the boys. I just get so angry everytime I see her. To be very honest, I feel jealous, and I know it is not a healthy behaviour. Please tell me what to do. I can not tell the boys the truth about her, because they are not goin to believe my anyways. Please help....

Anyways now I sit next to him more often, and there are a bunch of really ‘cooler’ kids that i sit next to. Im sort of new, and since I went to a private school, kids seem to judge on looks more than personality, but at this new skool, it’s the opposite, because ive always have depeded on my looks. (I know its sort of bad but here me on)   Idk, it feels weird. How can I get closer to them? What can we talk about?   And one girl seems to stare at me alotttt and its really weird, but sort of funny.   Help ? other than that im a former cheerleader. thx

20081028223219AADQMpj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do to make this guy notice me more?	There's this Mormon guy i like, he's in half of my classes, he's nice and funny, etc. Of course, he's Mormon, so he can't date until he's 16, right? So I asked him if he was allowed to go to Sadie's, and if he'd go with me if he was. He said sorry, can't go with someone til i'm 16. Can't tell if he likes me, sometimes I look at him and he's looking at me: today in class I looked at the clock then was turning back towards the front and I looked at him and he was just looking back towards the front, so it looked like he had been looking at me? We don't talk a whole lot because I feel kind of awkward after the Sadie's thing. After one of the classes we have together we're going to the same general area for our next class, and I've walked with him a few times, but now I just walk by myself because i can never think of anything to say to him... Any suggestions on what I can do here? We occasionally talk online, and we used to talk in one of our classes but now we have a new seating arrangement so i'm on the other side of the classroom. Help?

There was this guy in my class and he was always giving me really big smiles and saying hi. And I hardly ever talked to him. The only time I sat next to him, we were teasing each other and doing other good stuff like that...      Anyway, since I hadn't really talked to him, I decided to suck up the courage to go up to him and talk to him! =]      He was really happy to talk to me at first, but then after a while, he kinda got distracted because his friend kept kicking the soccer ball at him...      And ever since then... he's just ignored me. I mean, what the hell?!?!   Why would he do this?      The only other form of interaction we've had since then was when he gave me a small smile the other day..

Now something always told me that she liked me...i always liked her but i'll be 21 on the 25th of march and i think she's 25      economy was bad so i got laid off i needed up saying goodbye to my coworkers . and when i saw her i got her number.      now i wanted to talk to her face to face and for some reason i was nervous and i text messaged her (i know big mistake) that i liked her alot and i needed to get it off my chest i hope it don't change anything  . and shes answers back "no it doesn't change anything, we are good" . lol yeah i know bad       but recently  i went back to work to say hi , now she works in the back room and she stays therelike 90 percent of the day , but when she heard i was there she came out we went for a kiss on the cheek but she ended up getting like the whole left side of my lips and a hug and we spoke for a little bit      so .... i am confused . most likely it doesn't mean anything and i am just over thinking the situation but should I Leave It Alone? or what should i do?  i really like this girl

While I'm not a virgin (and neither is she) we slept together, for the first time, after dating for about three weeks. I'm just wondering the norm, really - she was breathing heavy, groaning a little and letting out medium-loud moans (you know) every so often. Was I pleasuring her, or... is there more?      Not to get too graphic, but there was a point where was she moaning loudly, scratching my back, grinding against me and all. How can I get to the 'next level?' What else can I do for her? How can I "do" it better?

20090304234223AAuD6nB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Two and a half years, am I rushing this?	My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years, but have known each other a lot longer than that. We have lived together before, though we currently don't because we are going to different colleges. I love him and he loves me, but I feel that after two and a half years together, he should be willing to commit to me. He says that he isn't ready to commit and wants to 'wing it.' I am 20 years old, and don't want to get married for several years, but I feel that I need commitment,especially if I am going to make decisions about my future around him.       He thinks I am asking too much of him, but I think that after 2 and a half years, I am within my rights to want to talk about the future and expect a certain level of commitment. Am I wrong? Should I be willing to 'wing it' and hope things work out?    Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! I need the opinions of someone who isn't directly related to this. Thanks!

20090304235623AAY1xc2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does he want from me?	There was this guy I met online and we started texting the very first day the whole day.. Next day, we texted all day again and finally got on the phone, we talked for hours. So, we kept on talking and texting, til we finally met up on valentines day and it was sweet. I mean, we had like so much in common that it was scary. After the date, we texted and talked a lot some more... and he was talking about how he wanted us to exclusively date, and that he wants me to meet his friends..and I said yea, sure. Went on our second date, he got fresh with me.. and I told him that I wasn't like that.. We chatted briefly.. next thing you know, he's talking about didn't want someone exclusively. So, I said we're better off as friends and it's cool with him to be friends and we chatted tonight... he aimed me first though. He got cheated on by his last 2 girlfriends... I don't get what this guy wants? This all happened in a month's time.

20090305012221AAOb3Tv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Strange Break up. Should I keep trying or move on?	So I met this girl a while back. We hit it off real quick and basically fell for each other in a few weeks. Timing wasn't perfect and after that we couldn't see each other for a few months but kept in touch. When we got back together we were really excited but it kinda fizzled after a bit more than a month.      We were both just really busy and prior to originally meeting each other, she had been in a long relationship. I brought up that it didn't seem like we were seeing each other enough and weren't as close. She said she wanted to keep hanging out and talking but that she kept going back and forth with whether she wanted to get into another committed relationship. I said I couldn't because I really liked her and that I couldn't keep getting closer if she wasn't sure. She said she really liked me and wished we could still see each other but knew it wasn't fair. It ended there quite mutually, friendly but strangely.      This is a few weeks back now and I've sent a text a while back asking how she was and she happily answered. No other communication since. We live really close to each other, have some mutual friends and hang out at similar places but haven't bumped into each other yet.       Any ideas if I it's worth keeping on my mind? Should I move on or wait to see what happens if we bump into each other? Should I try to get in touch? Have a drink or something with her?      I've had serious girlfriends and I know something special happened this time around and then fell apart due to timing. I don't know if I should just call it a pity and get over it. I'm really not that down or hurt about it. I'm not bad with girls but everyone knows the difference between someone you like and someone you're fooling around with. It's more my curiosity getting to me cause I feel two people who like each other shouldn't give up that easily.

20090305013235AAExtak	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a girl asks you to her house?	I'm 15 and i have know this girl for 6 weeks and we've become friends. A while ago people kept asking her if she liked me, and she said she kind of did, more than a friend, but maybe not enough? Anyway that was 2 weeks ago. Now we talk a hell of alot in english. I was told that us 2 can really talk by the most talkative person i know. I like this girl i've befriended but lots of people say shes slutty. Shes hot. A while ago we organised for 2 of us two to go to the movies. It never happened. We didn't bother, and she couldn't go on two occasions. Yesterday she asked me if i wanted to go to her house sometime to play pool and plasma tv at new house (she has new rumpus room - pool table, plasma). Then she said only if you want too. So what do i do? What does she mean when she asks this? Does she really just want to play pool at her house? Or does she want action? Please help give me some tips
20090305013137AAe54l9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my girfriend still love me if she 'likes' someone else?	Ok, well, my grilfriend and me got ina  row, mainly due to the fact that for the previous week she was worried about something and wouldnt tell me what. I managed, a few days ago, to find out that she feels that I am jealous of her contact with her best friend (a male, who I live with, who has no sexual feeling her her, nor her for him, trust me, and they have been friends for 4years), lets call him John. I have paranoid personality disorder, and well have become jealous (I cant blame my paranoia I know that),of him and her being good friends.      The main reason for her being distant the previous week was the fact that wehn me and her sat down and had a chat, she told me that she was worried about the fact that she liked (more than a friend) someone I know. She will not tell me who this person is, but insists that she loves me, and the liking means nothing (she even said that she knows nothing would be possible and that they dnt know or feel the same). Now she is very apologetic about the situation, and tells me that she loves me. I am worrying that becasue of my paranoia, over the past few weeks I have driven her away (to whcih I am now on anti-depressants), and that these liking feelings for someone I know,but someone she wont reveal the name of, are only becasue of the fact that I was driving her away.      Now, I have a feeling that it is someone, a friend of John, and a good friend of mine, lets call him Picasso, becasue the three of them have been spending time together. I know Picasso, much longer than my girlfriend (lets call her Cindy), and know that he is no way interested in her. I cant otherwise tihnk who she could be talking about when she says she likes someone, but loves me. She doesnt live in the same town as me, and comes to visit when she can (spending most time with me). Though I cant but wonder about the 'liking' of someone else. Someone I know.Was this just becasue I drove her away, what with being diagnosed, and councilling, and being suspicious of her, or is it that she just doesnt love me, and that she feels I'm the safety net (I've been going out with her longer than she has known Picasso, who I know for a fact wouldnt go for a girl like her, and I have know Picasso a long time). I cant be with someone who doesnt believe that one person should love one person. She says she was really sorry about saying it, but was it just that she thought she couldnt get the other guy, or did I push her away with my jealous paranoia of her friendships with my housemates (yes, I live with John and Picasso, so I know neither would go after her)      I am 20, Cindy is 19,John is 19, and Picasso is 22 I live with John and Picasso, and go to Uni, and Cindy is soon to come to the Uni.      I love the girl, but it comes to the point where I don't want someone who thinks I'm second best, as I'd know she isnt the girl for me, or is it becasue of my jealously, and paranoia, that I' working through at the moment.      Sorry if this is long, theres a lot to explain, and well it isnt just a case of yes or no I think. I'm thinking of laying off for a bit, then re evaluating my situation and thinking if shes the girl for me and I;m the guy for her at the moment. Any valuable input people? Is there something to save,, have I jsut pushed her away somewhat to see others, and that now she is realising that she loves me???

20090305030350AAdIxPp	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to help a friend in a mentally abusive internet relationship?	My friend who i have known for 15 years got in contact with a guy on the internet almost 2 yrs ago.   They have never met, he refuses to. They have never spoken on the phone, only text messages and instant messages is how they communicate.   I have started noticing how withdrawn she is becoming, and she has told me alot of things about how he is to her when they "speak" online.   He is very jealous of her going out, he is almost controlling her and making her feel guilty if she does go out with her friends.   An example, last week i went with her to the cinema, and as she couldnt use her phone in the cinema she was worried all night, she wanted to check if he had emailed her.   When she got home she said that she went online to chat to him and he went mad at her and said he didnt believe she was at the cinema and it was all crap about how she couldnt use her phone in the cinema etc..   And she just explains herself to him non stop, about what she is doing when we do go out together. she constantly makes excuses for his behaiviour. And says things like "i must have made him angry"    And "i should have worded it better to him as now he is angry with me"...etc.   She has panic attacks about him, she constantly worries about him.   And he hates all her friends, from what she has told him about us all,    He tries to keep her confined in her room glued to the laptop talking to him, she rarely comes out her room, she doesnt work, her parents support her, she is 25 years old!      He constantly makes up bulls*it stories and weird things, and she believes it all.   I have been in a mentally abusive relationship and i know how hard it is when people constantly tell you "he is no good for you" it makes you want to prove them all wrong so you stay with him, but this is surely not healthy, they have never met, he has no intention in meeting her, he keeps saying "we will meet, but soon, i am not ready, my ex cheated on me and i need time to trust women again"   It seems like things he says is like he hates women, for what his ex did to him, he doesn't trust my friend, and she is obsessed with the whole "fantasy" of maybe meeting him, and i know she loves the attention from him, as when he has a good day he is really nice to her, but she cant see through it like we all can.      I got out of my relationship, and i am much stronger now, and at the time she was advising ME on it all, i just wish she could see it is kind of the same as what she helped me through.      What can i say to her? i tried showing her stuff on the internet about abusive realtionships, like warning signs but she listens, and thanks me for caring , but the next minute she is online to him for 10 hours or more...      Please give me some advise, any would really be helpful to me.   I know telling someone that the man is no good for them doesnt help.   Do i just sit it out, and be there for her, until she finally realises what is going on?   I just fear that she is slowly turning crazy, and a bit mad over it all.   She is like a zombie over the computer for hours to him....         Thanks in advance.....

20081120093423AAYUDe5	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help dealing with a clingy friend?	About six months ago, when I was still with my ex, I met one of his friends (let's call her "Julie") and we decided to hang out with each other based on the fact that we liked a few of the same tv shows - weird huh? We did not hang out with one another that much, just once a month or so. At first I didn't mind being around Julie, but lately things have changed.      In October I broke up with my ex and I went for coffee with her to talk about what happened. She began talking about how she really wants to have a close female friend (she was home-schooled against her will and never really had much social interaction, and as a result doesn't have many friends). At first I thought that I'd give her a chance, but after spending more time around her, I realize that I can't stand to be around her for long periods of time. She's a real downer - ALWAYS complaining about this or that. She can be very rude and inconsiderate towards others. She is obsessed with her boyfriend, talks about him 95% of the time and is pressuring him to propose marriage even though they are both only 21 and have been together for ten months. She also is very stereotypically "girly" and likes to shop, I am more of a philosophical type who would rather hang out in a library. She also tries to bully me into doing things with her - for example, a month ago when I had a headache and didn't want to go out with her, she tried to bully me into going out anyways (I eventually persuaded her otherwise.)      Also, recently, I'm re-connecting with a good friend of mine from high school and we are discovering we have lots in common and are spending virtually all of our free time together. Julie, as a result, is jealous and demands to be invited on my hangouts with my other friend. I ignore Julie's calls most of the time and tell her that I am busy with school. But she is persistent. She has also threatened to hurt my ex if he ever hurts my feelings again.      What can I do to get her off my tail without being a total jerk to her?

Well this year in the second term a new guy came to our school, and I spoke two him once the second day he was here trying to help him with his locker combination and ever since then he has been in my head non-stop. I have barley spoken a word to him since that day yet whenever he is near me I want to melt, I would give anything just to get to know him. And lately this year I've really decided that I want to marry one day and have kids but I can only ever see me doing this with him. The trouble is I don't know him at all, all I know is he is a really good guy! I have liked so many guys over the years but none of them have been like this and I don't know what to tihnk. To make matters worse I have a girlfriend of two months (I'm bi) and I love her so much she is amazing. But whenever I see him, the only way I can really explain it is its like somthing draws me to him. Help anyone?

Odio estar asi, a pesar que si siento que lo quiero mucho, el me ha dicho que me ama ojo no creo que sea asi porque no ha pasado mucho desde conocernos imposible que pueda amarme..en fin...Tengo ganas de decirle que ya fue todo, que no sirvo para estar con nadie.,.Tampoco es que yo quiera algo formal algun dia con el , pero cuando me obsesiono con alguien ya deja de impoprytarme todo.Tengo miedo , no se que hacer , como tomar todo esto..Creo que tegno que cortarlo ?verdad? aunque la paso muy bien con el, y me gusta como es ...

20081101141906AAFjO7t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't bring myself to ask him out in person?	He's a really nice man, and I feel uncomfortable asking him out in person. I know he's single and straight, and he has told a mutual friend he'd like to call me (he has my number), but hasn't because... well, I don't know- I'm not sure if he's not sure if I like him, or he's only kind of interested, or because he's too busy working and taking care of his parents -they're not like dependent on him for their care  or anything, but he helps them w/ shopping, etc. after work. So I'm thinking of giving him a brief note saying " I know you're  busy every day, but if u need a break sometime, let me know and I could join you for coffee or a margarita (he mentioned it once to me in passing, like " I could use a margarita" at the end of an especially busy day)-  that I need a break sometimes too", w/ my number and email. Is that too forward, too vague, lame, or tame enough to not think I'm desperate (I'm not, but I'd really like to get to know him better). I know him professionally, and we are almost friends, but don't work for him or with him. I get to see him every couple of weeks or so. Any thoughts?

20081107234333AAUwuqI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband wants to be my slave. ?	We are a married couple and recently he has lost his job and he tried a lot for last few days but did not get any job.   I am a working Woman and I told him not to worry so much as whatever I earn we can live well without having problems but   he is now having some inferiority complex. So he is doing all household works like cleaning, cooking , laundry etc.    Yesterday he told me that he is just good for nothing for outside work and requested me not to divorce him and keep him   as my slave. I tried to convince him in many ways that I love him and do not want to divorce for such a small reason. But   he is saying that he wants at least to do some work and working as my slave is no problem for him. Yesterday morning I found him   polishing my boots and as I tried to stop him from doing it he became sentimental and told that I am thinking that he is   so useless that he do not have capability to be my slave even. So I did not intervene him in any ways. Our married life   is ok but all the time he behaves as if I am his Mistress and he is my slave. I saw him today scrubbing floors while I woke   up and as I woke up he came rushing with morning bed tea. He kissed me but while I was having my breakfast he sat on floor   and was massaging my feet. I am being treated as a queen which I was not used to. I told once to him to go to a psyacrist   but he became furious hearing it. He is saying that he will feel better if I give more work to do for the day and inspect   after coming back in evening.      So ladies please suggest me what you think regarding this and what should I do?

The other night, my boyfriend and I were about to kiss, and two seconds before our lips met, I accidentally shocked him!!! We laughed, and we were about to kiss again when I shocked him again... we laughed some more and kept repeating the process over and over, until we got fed up and just split apart... Now whenver we try to kiss, it keeps happening...       Should I just... you know... attack him and not care about the shocks or just break up with him because of them... cuz we can't get it on when nature keeps trying to break us apart!!! 
20081123104849AA6pbIz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why when I asked this girl out she seemed interested and asked were and when you want to meet then ignores me?	She ignores me all of a sudden. I email telling her would you like to meet for coffee. She told me she works from 11am-7pm Mondays-Fridays. I gave her a place and time and she ignores me. I tell her to meet in a coffee shop on a Saturday at 1pm she does not respond from a day then I emailed her telling her I changed my ming and lets meet on a Friday at 7:30 pm. I email her on face book and her regular email.I emailed her 5 times to remind her. I don't have her number and I only know her from college and I know were she works. I really like her. She does not ignore me all the time. I commented o her photo and she responded to my comment. We only flirted 4 times.    WHY WOULD SHE TELL ME WERE AND WHEN DO YOU WANT TO MEET AND WHEN I TELL HER WERE AND WHEN SHE CHANGES HER MIND? WHY DOESN'T SHE IGNORE ME FROM THE BEGINNING?

20090113132835AADvM2i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	=*( why wont she believe me?	I'm terrible at making things short but ill try...   she tells me i make her happy she likes me..we hangout and go to the movies...i keep it on the down low bc her brother is my age and hates me and she is a year older than me. Her brother knows and talks trash and finds out some stuff. Guys on my football team find it funny to get a rise out of eachother so they make up crazy stuff about her and i and tell him so rumors are flying....she tells me she never should have gotten involved with me, i explained everything i knew and that i didnt tell anyone anything (all we did was kiss, and i didnt even tell anyone)...she is usually after school so i stayed after to talk to her in person...i couldnt find her i texted her and she asked why i wanted to see her i said to talk she said you dont remember the convo last night
20090113184236AAWvgbY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys that cheat help me.....Wife almost catch me....?	My left for the weekend and during those days I have a couple guys coming over to my house to have adult fun. My bed make noise when you have sex on it so we usually put a pillow between the wall and the headboard and I did that while the guys were in my house.      One them brought lubricant and used a little and left it on top of our dresser. Well before my wife came back I went through the house to pick everything up making sure there was no evidence.      I pick condoms, lube, ... etc       When my wife came back she saw the pillow between the wall and the headboard and asked why did I put it there, and I told her was to avoid the bed making noise when I was moving in my sleep during the night, she was a little bit suspicious but did no say anything.      Monday morning when I was in my way to work she texted me and asked, when did you but lubricant and why is open and used? She found the lube bottle that one of the guy left on top of my dresser.      What would you say in this situations and what will be a convincing answer to cover up what I did during the weekend?

20090215174804AA7HyzM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Which girl would you choose/do you think I should choose (long question, thought out answers only please)?	At my high school, there are 2 girls that I am interested in, but the thing is they are twin sisters. But they don't look the exact same, but they are both pretty. I barely know either one, but I want to go after one, I obviously can't go after both. I'm a shy person and I have a hard time trying to start conversations with girls, but if they start one with me I can take it from there.      Girl 1: She is pretty outgoing, has beautiful eyes, and is a tad bit prettier than her sister. She is pretty open, I don't even make an effort to talk to her but sometimes she'll just say hey to me and sometimes ask me what did the teacher say or for help on work. She does cheerleading but I'm not sure there's a lot in common between us. She is more talkative than her sister, but she isn't one of those who talk all the time. She is more friends with some of the popular girls, and that's why I'm afraid she might not be so down to earth and because she is somewhat popular, her friends and/or her might not see fit for her to even talk/hang out with someone who is shy/not popular.      Girl 2: I feel that she is the one that I am more interested in for a number of reasons, but I also have my doubts. She is also a shy person like me, and sits next to me in a class. I feel that I have more in common with her because we both do the same sports (cross country and track). She is not as popular and has not as many friends as her sister, as I have seen her only to talk with a couple friends. In class, it seems sometimes as if she tries to avoid any conversation with me, even though the only times we have talked, was when I asked her what was the answer to a question, and when she asked me to borrow a pencil, but that was a couple months ago and it seems like she doesn't care about talking to me. One time my friend who is also a runner was talking to her and said that I was going to be valuable next year to the team, she made no comment to this, and all I said was I hope so. She didn't start talking again until my friend brought up another topic that wasn't about me. I want to try and talk to her, but I'm afraid that she is suspicious of me being into her because even though sometimes when I'm looking at her, she knows I am but doesn't look back, but I think she has caught me looking at her a couple times. That's why I'm afraid I try talking to her, she'll try to avoid the conversation by ending it because she thinks I'm weird or something. I have considered the possibility of her maybe liking me, but I doubt it because I think she would've tried to start a conversation with me or look at me sometimes in class but she doesn't.      Basically, I want to know your opinion about this. A general summary of what I think about girl 1 is that we don't have much in common, but is probably a cool person to talk to, but might not be as down to earth because she is popular. I am more interested in girl 2 because she seems like she has a good personality whenever I've heard her talking to other people, and I think her personality matches mine, and because she isn't as talkative and is a bit shy makes me think she is a nicer person than her sister, and I have more common with her.       And if you pick girl 2, please let me know what I can do to start talking to her besides just trying to say hi in class because we've been sitting next to each other for a couple months but haven't said much before so saying something like hey or how are you would probably be awkward since I haven't said anything to her before.

I'm not getting into that, but me and him are having to go separate ways. We only have one more week together. This is killing me. I cant stop crying. He's like we can always talk on the phone and on the computer, but it's just not the same to me. I cant deal with this. Im even taking suicide as an option. I will miss him too much. And I know that when i'm gone he is gonna be messing around with other people (trust me, i know) and that just hurts so much the thought of him and some other person. This is killing me, it hurts so bad emotionally and physically. I love him so much. I cant deal with this. He was my first love, first time, first everything. This hurts sooo much.
20090304221146AAiDvdp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problem with a female...?	So there is this one girl ive been talking to since Nov. We began to talk daily for hours through msn/txting...She gave me a bunch of hints that she liked me but i wasn't really that interested. I liked her but didn't really think much of it. I wasn't making moves or anything at all. So i guess since i didn't make a move she got with another guy. Didn't really care at first. I kinda was like "omg why didn't i ask her out" but it wasn't really that seriouse didn't care much. We kept on talking and talking and about 2 months ago i really fell for her. I told her how i felt and she asked why didn't i tell her before. Nothing happened time went on we still spoke/speak daily for hours.She told me about a week ago she was thinking of breaking up with her BF. But never did why would she ask me for advice about that instead of someone else? But the thing is shes always flirting with me. I feel like why flirt with me if your with this guy? Does she want me to tell her to dump the guy? About 2 weeks ago she asked me if i still had a thing for her and i answered her..but why does she still care? Any opinions

20090304224756AAMaPvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am attracted to my boss and I believe she is to me as well. How do I ask without well... asking?	I have worked for her for 9 months now and find her attractive not only physically (which she is gorgeous), but her wit, calmness, and above all intelligence makes me really admire, and has made me grow fond of her. When we have those "deeper, intense" moments of eye contact she smiles and blushes. I would really like to ask her out onto a date but I guess.... well I'm scared at this point. Also the only place where we have contact is as work which for us very inconvenient. We work at our counties waste/sewage management site and are the clean up crew. We wear all day from head to toe protective suits and are surrounded by, in plain terms... feces. By the time our suits are off we pack up our things and head home.

My friend Tony is like my best guy friend. i swear I love to mess with him (in a non sexual way)    He likes me, but I only see him as a friend.       Ever since he found out my boyfriend sighed up for the Navy he has been calling me daily.       Then today we were talking about something. I do not remember what, but he said how long do u plan on staying with your boyfriend?       I said well your going to have to ask him that...Then Tony said well he is going to say a life time....if he is smart he would       then I said, Well I am not going to break up with him       and Tony said unless he does something stupid.          what he is trying get at, or do, or thinking?

20090304230644AAs4j9u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pleasee Helpp :(!!!!?	A boy i really fancied,, just turned me down when i asked him out,,  im so embarassed to go back to school tomorrow, what can i do?
20090304231231AAlybMz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean if my girl never keeps eye contact for a second when i'm talking to her, and vise versa?	Every time we'll be hanging out with people, we'll all be talking, yet when i'm talking to her she'll be glancing at other people most of the time and does the same when she's talking to me. I wouldn't think of this as an issue if she did it to everybody. but she only does it to me, i even got a few other opinions on it and it's true, i'm the only guy in the room she won't be looking at while talking. And yes i have talked to her about it, all she ever says is she doesn't notice it and doesn't think anythings she's doing is wrong, but is still constantly holding attention with this one guy when talking and being talked to. All i gotta ask is what does this mean, and why can't i get some damn eye contact when other guys can. (oh yeah, she's a good girl and seems very faithful, no relationship problems whatsoever other than this, but the eye contact thing is a pet peeve, so i can't answer it myself.)
20090304232136AAbkvL4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't find myself, help me, or give me tips?	okay, so here it goes.  i'm 15, and i'm having school troubles that i cause myself.  these are all social, gradewise, i'm golden.  I started out having a great year, with loads of friends, then this girl came and we were really good friends too! then, a few weeks later, she drifted away with another girl from the group.  After that, i started to change.  it was me and 2 other girls.  I started to feel awkward around the other 2 who moved away(R and L) and i try to avoid them, which isn't me.  Usually, i'd confront people if i had a problem! i am a very outgoing person, but something, i'm not sure exactly what, is making me hush up...i don't talk much anymore, and i'm not as funny.  I want that to change.  I think it might be the presence of the other girls.     The other problem is that i crave social status, but i live so far away from my school that everyone that i never have a chance to hang out with anyone, and i always feel inferior especially to L...i don't know what to do, but i'm not sure i can survive the school year feeling like this.
20090304232549AAgJGDf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women are confusing!...Help?...?	Okay...so I'll just give it to you guys...I'm in college.  I've only had one girlfriend.  She cheated on me.  I've only kissed one girl.  I have no self-confidence.  I don't drink and do the stereotypical college activities.  I suck at life.      So there's that to set up the picture.  Now...for the help part...There's this girl (duh) in my Astronomy class.  I thought she was a cutie-pie at the beginning of semester so I didn't really try anything.  Then one night before lab about a month ago I did something goofy and made her giggle...And she got me.  So now I like her.  Question is...does she actually like ME back?  She's a grade ahead of me.  She's president of her sorority, and I'm just a brother in my fraternity.  Way outta my league is what I'm thinking.  Anywho to give you some stuff as to what happens...I won't tell all.  It'll take too long and I don't want to bore you...But some of the stuff is pretty typical of girl's "liking" guys...but I'm dumb and can't tell if she likes me...So some examples...Okay...I'm usually in class before she is and every time she comes in her head pops to where my brother (fraternal, haha) and I sit.  We sit behind her in class.  She looks back at our table a lot during class...can't tell if she's looking at me though...don't want to be too conspicuous...But I do catch her every once in a while b/c I can't help looking at her myself.  After class when my brother and I are talking in a group she usually looks at me and I know that she is.  She's looked at me dead in the eye quite a few times.  I smile as usual...It also seems like she and her friend stalled after class a few times...But...the girl is really quiet.  She doesn't talk too much.  In class at least.  We haven't really spoken at all.  I know I'm an idiot.  But it continues in our dining hall.  Every time I'm in the hall the table with her sorority sisters always looks at me...Some of them don't but it always seems like her closest friends always do.  I've come to the conclusion that A) I'm weird looking or B) She actually likes me...      I know you guys are like "balls up" and well...I have...for the past 2 weeks I've been TRYING to talk to her but for some unknown reason known only by God something ALWAYS happens to where I can't talk with her.  A) our teacher isn't that good and I end up having to basically teach the class B) class miraculously gets cancelled C) many other things that happen.      She also isn't all the way over her boyfriend...according to some people.  There have been some facebook statuses to where she's "confused" and yada yada.  There's one that was done in our lab...where it seems like her friend was poking fun at her because of someone that they love to talk about in class.  it's either A) our professor or B) someone in class (that sounded retarded...)      Oh my God...Sorry for writing so much CRAP!  and to bore you all...but some insight would be nice because I'm so confused when it comes to girls anymore after being cheated on and having my self confidence being utterly destroyed over the past year because I thought I was doing everything right but found out it was actually wrong...So if anyone can make sense of any of this mess, it would be SO appreciated...I just want to be happy and have a lady friend like all of my brothers... :'(  haha :P
20090304232735AA3Dw5k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Finally after all the abuses me and my boyfriend broke up, he had duped me of my money and emotions but still?	I am unable to get over  and miss him and just cant stop crying pls help me to get over him
20090304232843AAwiX2i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend broke-up with me yesterday, and I can't stop crying?	Yesterday my boyfriend Victor calls me on my cell phone. I asked him how his day was, and he said "bad." He asked me, "Do you think I'm a good person?" I said "yes." Then he talks about how bad he feels because he can't see me when he can. And then he talks about the future, and he said, "I don't want to think about the future. I'm afraid you're not going to be in it. I'm just not ready to take care of somebody else. I don't want to hurt you." Then I ask him, "So you're breaking-up with me?" Victor got quiet for about 10 seconds, and said "I don't know how to say this, but I think we should go on our seperate ways FOR NOW." He had also told me a story about how his parents were dating off and on. And then they finally got married. In addition to that, Victor said that he wanted to make The Marine Corps a career, and that he didn't want me to be depressed or sad. But I already am! He broke-up with me!       Here is a message he sent to me from MySpace:   I have to delete you off my profile I'm so sorry when I see your pic I see the past and I am sad so sorry but I see the woman that I once was with and right now I'm just to sad I hope u get this.      I replied and said "please talk to me. what's wrong? i want to know why you broke up with me.      And here's what he wrote:   Like I said it's an long story and I just need time and that's it I don't want to talk ok I can't it just makes things worse I fill so sad when I talk to you When I'm ready I will talk to you till then.       And one more thing. Before I got done with him on the phone, he said these words to me, "Hopefully everything works out. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be."       I FEEL TERRIBLE!!!! ;-( This is my first break-up, and I'm here crying like somebody passed away. I feel like Victor ripped my heart out of my chest, and ran it over with a steamroller. I don't know what to do! I feel like a dream of mine has come to a screeching halt. What should I do?
20090304234727AAw8piA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friends vs girlfriend... Who do i choose?	Ok... i am having trouble with my girlfriend and it is affecting my friends and everything is getting nasty and out of control, and i have no idea wat to do      I'll explain everything in bullet points 4 simplicity...      -the main conflict is between my gf and one of my close friends, who is also a girl (we are all around 18 by the way)   -my gf is jealous of the closeness me and my friend have. It also doesnt help that my friend is south african and my gf hates south africans because of past issues ( before we started going out... we started going out a year ago )   - Me and my friend have done nothing wrong   - However my gf has mistreated and abused and harrased my friend ( and her twin sister, also my friend but not as close ) and this has caused both twins to break away from me because of the hurt that my gf caused   - Now my other friends are angry at my gf because of the hurt she has called to the twins, and to me. There's been nasty comments going back and forth from both sides on Bebo... and also some of them, who were good friends with my gf, have broken off from her in disgust   - I have tried to reason my gf multiple times ova a period of months but she wont listen. Recently i almost said enuf and break up... but i couldnt do it...   - The biggest problem at the moment is that my gf's grandad is in hospital and its quite serious... she is in too much of a bad state to bring more bad news on her. Also many of her friends shes losing or r moving away which doesnt help      Can anyone help? Im at a lost point in my life.
20090304234317AAFrKnj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Straight guy, Gay thoughts?	Okay, so I do not know how to start something like this, but I am going to do my best to get what I am trying to say out there.    I am a heterosexual male. My girlfriend and I both love the feeling of having sex. Lately I have had some thoughts about guys and sexual intercourse with them. The thoughts are arousing but I don't know how to approach this feeling. I don't really want to get in a relationship with a guy and lose my girlfriend if it isn't something that i like in the long run. Basically I would like to feel what it would be like to be with a man instead of a woman but still keep my girlfriend. How would I go about doing this in such a manner that I won't regret? Do I tell my girlfriend?
20090304234439AAPKlHx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I m in love but i m afraid to tel her that i love her?	every day we see each other and every single time i feel like falling in love more deeply.   i think she also likes me but i m bit confused   how can i know that she likes me ?   pls help me
20090304234650AAdKHvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl my girlfriend? and if not, how do I get there?	I've been seeing a girl for a little over a month and I want to (a) sleep with her and (b) make her my girlfriend.  Usually I would have part (a) on lock down by now, but this girl is pretty Christian and I think she wants to take things slow, which I'm fine with because I actually like her.  In fact I haven't liked a girl like this in a long time.        I basically want to know how to play the middle game (the game right before you become boyfriend and girlfriend) because I haven't had a bona fide girlfriend in a while (though I've seen lots of women).        Necessary background:       PROS:  We've seen each other 5 or 6 times and have had fun each time.  We talk or text every other day pretty much (maybe every 2.5 days if you averaged it).  She's kissy and holds my hand.      CONS: She doesn't invite me out to places now.  She was the initial aggressor, but now its me.  For instance, tomorrow night and Friday night she's going out to a happy hour and her freinds birthday but hasn't invited me to either. She's also just a really busy person being in college (I'm a law student) so I'll ask her out and it'll take a little while for her to find a mutually convenient time (i.e. i've gotten a lot of "i'm busy then, but what about...").        QUESTION IS...How do I play this one from here out?  Should I play it hard to get now that I've demonstrated my interest or do I keep on with the blitz and do something real nice like take her to a sports game and a nice dinner?  I am great with the 1-4 date range; I am completely lost now that we're beyond that.          Chronology (which you don't need to read unless you are interested):        1 - She went on a date with a mutual friend 6 months ago and it went awful for them, but we really had a vibe.   2 - She recognized me at a bar and asked for my number like 5 weeks ago.     3 - She texted me and said lets hang out the next day.     4 - I took her out to dinner that thursday (kiss on the cheek)   5 - a week later we meet for coffee, talk, enjoy our time. She invites me to dinner at her house after but I'm busy.    6 - 2 days later, we meet out at a bar (make out, a little middle-schoolish though)   7 - 2 days later, I'm by her place we get coffee real fast.    8 - a week later I had her make me dinner at her place and we went out after and had fun till like 230 in the morning (she asks "So, what are we doing now" I say "well, i'm not tired, we could go back to your apt and see what your roomate is up to"  response: "well, i'm getting tired and I have a lot of work to do tomorrow so i'm gonna grab this cab.")   9 - Called her on monday asked her out to dinner but she said she was real busy this week.  Said maybe lunch on friday but i'm busy then anyways.     10- texted her today and said good luck on some crap she has going on tomorrow.        No talk about plans for this weekend.  Oh, and for what its worth, she goes on spring break not this next week, but the week after.
20090304234812AAaDgKG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get this girl to get interested when she already has a bf?	The girl and I are mild friends at my high school.  I was going to ask her out, but another dude beat me to it.  I want this girl to become interested in me while she is dating him and want to go out with me after they break up.  I can't really compliment her without things going awry with her boyfriend. What are some smart ways to get her like me in that sort of way?
20090304234830AAfe12j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Clever ways to ask a guy to girldate?	the same thing as the Sadie Hawkins dance, the girl asks the guy.      a few obstacles though:    -my friend and i want to ask the guys we like together (they're good friends too)   -they don't go to our school   -actually they both graduated highschool last year...but they already said they would still have fun at a highschool dance      we are trying to think of something cute and funny we can do while the four of us are hanging out together?  ANY ideas would help, even if they sound dumb!
20090304235213AAsqWEb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to forget someone?	I have a huge crush on my long-time college friend. I just reconnect with him a while ago and he hang out for three or four times. We text a lot to each other every couple of days. The last time we hang out was last two weeks and he did not ask me to hang out anymore. I think maybe he didn't like me 'cause I heard that when guys decrease contact with someone, that means they don't like that person anymore. I tried to forget about having great time with him but everytime I try to forget him, I feel like something is missing in my life and I feel really sad. What should I do?
20090305000608AAEnFef	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this what guys normally do or does he like me?	Ok. Im 13 and the guy who everyone thinks likes me is 13 as well. The thing is we started off with ALOT in common, such as were both fall out boy fans and footy fans. Apparently he is "flirting" with me. For example this is what he does. He sometimes makes funny faces at me which make me laugh. Out of no where he calls out my name. At lunch time i see him staring at me alot. Then in maths in a test today he was looking at me most of the time and every time i caught him he would smile. He makes alot of jokes around me and a few days ago he did something really wrong, he points to me then himself and then like moves his d*** forward and back like sex moves and then he says hes only kidding. Everyone thinks he likes me but i have no clue if its true or not . Is he just being friendly or he really likes me ?
20090305000631AAQMNkD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What type of Relationship would you call this?	Well I have a best friend who is a guy and I love him dearly but not in love with him and vice versa-but we have a very unusual relationship for example we sleep in the same bed everytime we hang out with eachother, and when we sleep he holds me at night-We eat out of the same forks/spoons, drink out fo the same cup, we hug(and not that cheao guy hug a real affectionate hug)-i kiss him on the cheek when i say bye-we hold hands sometimes, we cuddle sometimes, and one time he was eating and he had dirtied his face and i wiped off the the stuff on his face(which was cake)then licked it off my fingers-sometimes i even sit on his lap-we nuzzle eachother always-we give eachother eskimo kisses-i play with his hair-i give him massages too-and we say i love you to eachother      I'm alittle  confused because ppl say that we should just date because they say we r in love-others say we are just good friends- i just would like to know what u guys think because i dont think i have any feelings for him and i dont think he feels that way either......i dont know what do you think??

20090305005533AAFfOVV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why i do attract girls that i'm not interested in?	I am a young man who is just starting uni. i didnt make any friends in highschool and i especially didnt have any girlfriends in my time at highschool. i'm 19, dark skinned and i have an athletic build. I always had a preference for white women because i have an interest with western culture and i want to blend and break the stereotype of couples being the same race. but for some reason only the indian girls are willing to love me for who i am but i want to mix with other races cos i dont discriminate and i like diversity. don't get me wrong i have nothing against indians, but i have a preference for white women because i am naturally attracted to them.
20090305005907AA4yzfm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in a bit of a pickle here...?	basically, i lied to this guy about being married... b/c i had a wedding ring on. i tend to be more shy and wear a ring to avoid anything, i guess... i'm not ready to be in a relationship since the last guy decided to hook up w/ my best friend (at the time) behind my back. anyways, b/c i had the ring on, i felt compelled to say "my husband" in a conversation... only problem is, there is no hubby. and now, i'm in a pickle b/c i am kinda starting to like the guy... i'm just really unsure of how to go about this. any help on the matter would be greatly appreciated!
20090305012604AAN1TN8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kind of a follow up to "pickle" question...?	i agree with all the answers to tell the truth, that was my gut instinct. but i'm curious... how can i tell if he's into me? like body language or whatever?? i'm just in an extremely cautious place, and i don't want to get hurt again, but i also don't want to miss out on something good b/c of fear.... thanks again to any advice/help!

Can you love someone in a relationship, and not quite be ready for more intimate affection (ie. being naked around each other or sex).

20090305015711AASg8YD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to be better and talking to girls?	I've recently started university and there are a lot of really interesting and pretty girls everywhere, but I'm no good at chatting up girls. I barely have any female friends at all; maybe girls just don't find me interesting, so obviously from what I've just mentioned, you would be correct to assume I have never had a girlfriend. But i want to change that now that I'm in university-- I don't mean I'm looking for a girlfriend specifically-- I just mean I would like to also have female friends and to be better at talking to girls. I just find it hard; maybe I'm too self conscious or it's psychological or something! Like today, I sat opposite this REALLY pretty girl on the bus home and I couldn't say a word to her... in fact, I couldn't even raise my head to look in her direction so I spent the whole journey looking at my feet! I know what you're probably thinking: this guy is pathetic. You're probably right to say that, but I want to change it. So please, any tips on how to be better at conversing with girls? I would really appreciate feedback from actual girls on this matter, but guys are more than welcome to share some tips as well, please. Thanks. ;-)

20090305023244AAN5kC8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I the oldest virgin? Who is the oldest virgin you know? What is an absurd age to lose virginity?	As of this posting, I am 24 years old and I am still a virgin. I have never even been on a date. I have never kissed a girl.       When I was in 8th grade I had my only girlfriend. I wasn't really ready. It was a joke. I remember once she kissed me on the cheek. As pathetic as it sounds, that's the furthest I've ever been with a girl as of yet.       Note: I don't want a bunch of religious yokels blatheting at me that this is a good thing or that I should be proud of this. I don't buy your garbage. No offense. I don't believe in your religious ideals. I don't believe there is anything sacred or noble about virginity. I don't believe that there is some magical man in the sky who keeps track of virginity and who frowns upon pre-marital intercourse. It's a bunch of man-made nonsense, it's silly, it's absurd, it's not real, and I don't want to hear about it. Thanks.       Sexuality is, to most people, an obvious sign of healthy and normal relationships. I don't have this.       I don't know if it's just shyness, or if it's something deeper. Women don't mind being my friend, but they evidently feel no sexual attraction to me.       At 24, is being a virgin quite pathetic? Is it more common than the media would let on, or am I right to think it's ridiculous? Do you know any virgins of a similar age, or older? What's their story?       Personally, I have basically completely accepted that some people are just meant to be alone for their entire lives, and that I am one of those people. I will most likely die as a virgin.       (Although to be honest, the sex itself is not the thing that disturbs me or that I even care about. Yes, it'd be nice to get laid, but what I really want is a genuine romantic connection with somebody, which would obviously entail sex but also a much more important connection. I don't think I will ever experience it. It's too late for me.)

20090305032834AALifc4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i do?!!?!?!?!?	we've been seeing each other about three weeks   we have been chatting like for a good 3-4 hours + on msn pretty much every night since i met her.   We've been out like 12 times, saw each other pretty much everyday last week.. Spent friday, saturday and sunday together..    I went to see her tuesday night and i cooked for her... but she told me her ex was coming over at like 10 (they were giong out for 4 month).. they broke up because she was spending time with me and he got jealous. She always tells me all these things about how he's a jerk, pulling other girls, getting there numbers, how shes not been happy in ages and how i make her happy for the first time in so long... Anyway it was a bit wierd on tuesday night, she was really anxious and just acting a bit strange.. she is really worried what he'll do to me as he's a bouncer and a bit of a loose wire.. I just asked her why she bothered talking to him if he made her so unhappy... she told me she still has feelings for him.. But she also told me last night that she has feelings for me.. I've told her as have lots of other people that he's only doing it to spite her for seeing me.. He dumped her and soon as me and her started spending more time together he started sending her messages saying things like 'i miss you and love you and i want you back... and its really been messing wih her.. she tells me all the time she wants nothing to do with him...      Anyway, we have got pretty close, i've told her things i;ve not told anyone else before, all over the weekend we just layed cudderling till about 2am.. it was just really nice..      Then last night driving away i saw them walking and it just made me realise that they may be getting back together... I don't know what to do, She messaged me about 12.30 tuesday night asking if i was alright.. i just said surely she can understand it wasn't easy for me to see them as i drove away..      I've met her parents and all that.. they can't stand the other guy and they love me.. everyone tells her not to mess me about because she'll regret it if i go...      I was told maybe to message her saying, maybe we shouldn't see each other until you decide what you want.      On the other hand i really want to see her and find out what happened on tuesday night.. I know what he's doing, he knows exactly what to say to bring her crashing back down again when shes happy...      I didn;t message her yesturday or talk to her.. i stayed off msn as well, first time we havn't contacted each other in 3 weeks..       Would should i do?

I don't know how but I've started to fall for him now. He's so kind n he's always there for me, but he doesn't feel the same way as me. A while back he said he had feelings for this girl who has nothing in common with him n is a total cow to everyone n so I know he doesn't feel the same. I keep trying to just be friends n put my feelings aside but its so hard. Every time we watch movies I spend more time wishing he'd hold my hand just the once then watching the movie n when we go out I just cross my fingers n hope he doesn't find some other girl so I don't have to see him fall for someone who isn't me. It sucks and I wish I didn't feel this way. What do I do? How do I stop feeling this way?

My best mate who i've known for 16 years split up with his g/f about a year ago now. Shes still here in the Uk and still meets up with him as friends, and I meet up with them too sometimes if i'm around.   Thing is they went out for about 3 years and recently she told me she likes me. I do like her, but if I did go out with her I would just find it real dodgy dating my best mates ex.   Also, she told his mum that she likes me ! which I couldn't believe. It just makes things real akward now when we all meet up. I dont want to risk losing my mate over this, so what should I do ? I think its best just to stay clear.  Any advice appreciated.

Depuis près de 10 mois, je discute via le net et par téléphone avec une fille dont j'ai fait la connaissance sur un site de rencontre.    Par trois fois, nous devions nous rencontrer (nous habitons a 450kms l'un de l'autre) et cela ne s'est pas fait car elle a toujours fait marche arrière.   Par moment, ses paroles me faisaient penser que nous pourrions être plus que des amis et à d'autre elle me disait ne pas me voir autrement. Nous avions coupé les ponts suite à l'annulation de notre dernier rdv et depuis trois semaines nous avons repris contacts et là ce soir après 4 ou 5 jours sans dialogue, elle me dit qu'elle se rend compte que je lui manque plus qu'elle ne le croyait, qu'elle pense tout le temps à moi et qu'elle croit être amoureuse. Elle a connu bcp de déception par le passé. Moi je sais que c'est une fille bien et j'espère que ca sera plus qu'une amie pour moi. En plus elle m'invite a passer noel avec elle et sa famille mais en amis et on verra par la suite   Qu'en pensez vous ?

20090305040613AAON3vq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crazyness going on around here!!!!?	Long story short, I was supposed to go visit my ex this weekend coming up. I visited her Valentine weekend and we spent a night together drinking wine, making dinner, cutting up and talking basically all night long. We didn't sleep together. Then I week later she calls me and tells me she is not emotionally ready to spend an entire weekend with me. ok. cool, I can work passed this. So lately, we have been talking on the phone, bbming, flirting with one another here and there.       I guess through a mutual friend she found out I was going to go visit some friends in a nearby city and all of a sudden she is too. BTW she lives 6 hrs away now. When I found out I was like WTF! She has been asking me where I am going to be and what I will be doing for the weekend. I do love her still and do want to be with her, but was thrown back by this move of hers. What should I expect? Why would she do this on the same weekend I was supposed to go see her? Any insight would be appreciated!      No one saying she is your ex for a reason!

And I am tired of that, so I might ask him directly "what the hell? Are you interested or not?". But if now you all tell me that it is about the chase then, I'll wait a bit longer.

20090305045615AALoVP5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Trust Issues!  How do I help her get over them?	Several years ago I found out that my girlfriend cheated on me with some guy she met at a hotel.  I was angry but I forgave her.  It took some time but it did happen and I've told her this.  Ok, about a year or so later I almost cheated on her.  It didn't happen but it was heading down that road.  Now, almost 2 years later I am still being look at based on that one incident.  Everytime my cell phone rings she looks at me strange.  When ever I get a text message she questions it.  If I put on cologne to go to work she thinks that's strange.  If I walk behind her or in front of her out in public to her that's a sign I don't want to be with her.  If I take a drive after we have an argument then see sees that as a sign that I'm just going over some other woman's house.  It's even gotten to the point of her looking on Craigslist in the casual encounters section and if she sees a guy my age in our city she assumes it's me trying to hook up with other women.   It's stuff like this that's driving me crazy.  You can't live in the past but my god, it's time to move past that.  Some people have told me that the best way to get her past this is to reassure her but I'm not doing anything so I have to reassure being faithful?  I go to work and come home, that's it.  I'm tired of having to prove myself to her only to still be looked at as a cheater.  I don't do her that way.  She leaves the house and the last thing I think about is "is she going to meet someone" or "is she going to a hotel?"  I have better things to do with my time.  But I'm not sure how much more of her inquisition I can take.  Even if I don't touch her while we're sitting in bed is a sign to her.        How do I reassure her without hiring a skywritter?      I'm one step from letting this relationship go.  We're suppose to be getting married but I refuse to cary this into our marriage.      What can I do?
20090305042253AAlO95k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Women don't care about men's feelings?	Me and my girlfriend / fiance have been arguing for the past few days over something petty to her but serious to me.        My work schedule, due to training for a new job is from 11 AM to 8 PM.  So, I'm gone most of the day and don't get home untill well after my girl.  The other night she was at church when I got off so I stopped by for a few minutes.  When she was finished she walked up to me and smelled my cologne and actually started sniffing me.  Yes, I was a little uncomfortable with her sniffing me like a dog because it was the same cologne I've always worn so it wasn't like it was a new scent.  The mothers and deacons were walking by looking at her and the pastor was right there in the sanctuary so he may have seen it too.  In a bad move on mybehalf I put my elbow up to sort of distance myself from her.  Not to push her off me but just to let her know not now.  Bad reaction on my part but she took that as a sign that I didn't want her to touch me.        I just didn't want her sniffing me like that in the church sanctuary.  I told her I was uncomfortable but that doesn't seem to register with her.  Sure, as a guy I'm suppose to just suck it up but had I done something and she told me she was uncomfortable everyone would be on my case for it.  She thinks that as a woman and being my man she should be able to show PDA's when ever she wants.  We go to the mall or store and she's always got to be touching me some kind of way.  If I walk a few feet ahead of her or behind her she thinks I don't want to be with her.  I have no privacy.  If I take a cell phone call in the next room she wants to know who it was and why I didn't talk right there with her.  If I talk to any other woman she thinks I'm just trying to push up on her.  If I take a drive after an argument she thinks I'm using that as an excuse to go over some other woman's house.  But ask her and she feels justified.  If I wasn't doing anything I'd stay home with her during an argument.  Or I'd want her to hear my phone conversations to prove I wasn't cheating.  Stuff like that.  It's getting unreal at the stuff I have to put up with but she thinks that's fine.        Yes, I apologized for my elbow incident but she has yet to apologize for making me uncomfortable.  I'm in training to become a deacon at my church and this is not the image I want to portray in the sanctuary.  She could have waited till we were outside or even at home.  She wanted to do that right then and right now.        I feel I always have to prove to her that I'm not cheating on her than her just not knowing it.  I'll bet so much of her day is filled with what he's doing and what he's talking to than just doing her job.  "Why's he wearing cologne to train on a new job?  Is there some woman he's trying to get close to?"  See, that stuff would tire me out.  I don't have time to worry about you because I have enough on my plate just worrying about me.  I'm tired of having to prove to her I'm not cheating.      Help.        Sorry for story being so long.

20090305045026AAIjAvm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does he mean by 'effort'?	well, thing is me and my bf of 20months had reacently had an argument as he does not make a lot of efort to make the relationship work anymore, in terms of arguments and being rude with me (and breaking his promises to change his behaviour), and he has changed a lot compared to how he used to be since we first met. i wanted that OLD bf of mine back. at the end he came running back to me begging to give him another chance. he literally 'begged'! he promised me he would change and make all the effort in the world to make this work. his apologised a lot. i could tell he was sorry.       so i have taken him back, but the thing is his 'efforts' that he is makeing now, compared to when he begged me, are nil. he rings me once, and if i miss it he doesnt ring again, and he always texts me back really late. i mean what kind of an effort is this?? i know it seems small but then why did he say he will make 3 times as much of an effort. i even told him , actions speak louder than words. please can anyone sincerely explain to me waht is rong here as i am in a state of confusion. my friend told me that he looked very upset at Uni today, could it be then that he needs a little but of time to think about his mistakes??      any answers will be appreciated- apologies for the essay however, being in this seems to be a dilemma, more than it does to any one outside of this bubble.

20090305041455AAZIkvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just need good answers TOPIC is love?	Eh i do not know what to think...Is it real love or not   Is there low or high possibility to fall in REAL love when your 17 or 18.   Or its just not real love      Many of my friends have different situations...Some sai thay are in real love but they left their partners even thought they said I LOVE 4 EVER and never leave you      Some are still together.   So is there higher chance that girl actuly loves real love and wouldnt cheat you and so on and love wouldnt disapear      I defenetly know that there is alot smaller chance that boys love a real love...Like most boys always cheat.      So do you think its possible t love real love at age 17 and never cheat and never lose the ove you have? For a girls i mean

MORE INFO!?	finished things with my bf 2 days ago now- its was a mutual descion but i was the one to bring the subject up.       we both then went to sleep ( had to sleep at his becuase of the hour distance to my home and coudnt catch the Train at night)       In the morning - we was both really quiet, i was'nt saying much but then he started "making jokes" saying sorry for the s h i t s*x and "at least ive got some stories to tell about that" he was also laughing at somethings on the TV and just acting not upset. i just think did he ever care..? how can he be making jokes. and when i brought the subject up again he was like " ahh lets not talk about it again" and also, he was taking pictures of me on his phone ( of my face!) isnt that abit weird when we've just broke up?- When i asked him why he is taking the pics - he said "i dont know" and started laughing. he was saying to me how he doesnnt want me to go home and be depressed -how can i not be abit depressed after 9 months with him. why did he do and say these things....?

20090305041504AARdGxt	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Child abuse or just plain old assault and verbal abuse?	ok This may be a little long.         My boyfriend is 26 and has an 18yr old sister who is in her Sr. year of high school.  He has moved out from his parents already but then recived a phonecall from his grandfather two years later asking him to come home and live with him (just the two of them) because he was dying.  So, he did and they lived happily together for three more years, much longer than expected.   When grandfather died this last december, my bf was fired due to a "no call no show" when he had turned in a written notice stating that he needed to take his three day grievance period and recived authorization they day of the death!  So,  being as how the economy sucks, he is stuck at home with no job.  His parents and sister moved in as well into grandfathers home.       his mother is constantly telling him to get out. also she came at him with a fryingpan in an angry uproar.  He pushed her onto the couch in self defence.        When he was just turned 18, his father had placed him in a choke hold infront of the mother, sister and my bf's best buddy.  when his sister and friend saw that he was about to pass out they began to advance on the father to stop him, his mother held them back.       She is constantly telling him that he is worthless, that his oppinions do not matter, that he doesnt know anything about "family" (when they dont invite him ANYWHERE that the three of them go).  She also teaches the common practice of "treat others as you want to be treated."   So, when she yells and screams for a random reason calling them stupid or telling them to shut up, and then give it back she gets even more angry and states "I have a very difficult job, i can act however I want in my own home"   and that if his sister talkes to her in any way a raised tone, she would be backhanded. (she JUST turned 18, can still be abuse or no?)   Piece of work.   is there anything that they can do about her to get her some behavorial help?

20090305040528AACt3Xh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Stuck in the "friend-zone"?	I have been in love with my best friend since the day I met him, almost 2 years ago. He is not aware of my feelings for him, and there has never been anything said by him to indicate that he feels the same way about me. Recently, I stayed over at his apartment and we ended up just sharing his bed with him. Suddenly, he started cuddling with me, arms wrapped around (spooning actually), but the next day it was as if nothing was amiss. It happened the next night too...and, again, nothing was said.   My question is for the guys: Would you cuddle like that with a girl you were not attracted to her romantically?

We had a night alone, but nothing happened, because he said if somthing did, then we would end up quititng our jobs because of the feelings that we would have.   Thats why i like this guy, but how do i get him to change his mind.   He admited to me that he had the same feelings that i had, but cant act on them.  I have later asked him out for drinks or just to hang out, but he always declines.   Do i keep trying with this, or do i just somehow let go?   When i  am with him , we laugh, talk, seem to understand each other, and i know he feels it too.  we both throw a flurt or two in there, i just dont understand.   Can anyone help here?....thank you

20090305041453AARIjrb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help getting over the love of my life! please help!?	i met my best friend pete when i was 16, we dated briefly but it didnt work and stayed friends. Shortly after i met a guy simon who i started dating. About 2years later me and simon broke up for a few months and me and pete ended up sleeping together. He was moving to uni and we both wanted more but he felt like wouldnt work long distance and pushed me away. i got back with simon and fell pregant with my daughter. me and pete stayed in touch and talked about everything, he was the best friend a girl could ask for   . When i got married to simon he came to stay and was the first time we had seen eachother since the day we had slept together years before. he came on my hen night and even in the car to the wedding with me. The next day my new husband went to see his family while i stayed home wit pete. we sat chatting on the sofa with his head on my lap me stroking his hair. we both realised that day we felt more than friendship but knew we could never act on it. so we stayed in touch but said we wouldnt meet up again as wasnt right.      fast forward 3 years, im in an abusive marriage and finally get courage to end it, i decide to spend a weekend away and i go to see pete. we spend the weekend talking and laughing just being comfortable together and the afternoon im meant to leave we kiss and both admit we loved eachother      so we wait for bout 3 months before we start datin, and are both so happy to have it out in the open. People had suspected as when i was 18 i had his name tattooed across top of my back. We arranged for me to visit on his birthday and talked every night on the phone.      suddenly i get a message saying he thinks it best we go back to being friends. im obv upset but say if that wat he wants will accept it. The next day he decides we cant stay friends. Its best for me if we end all contact. I say ok lets steo back a few months and wait and see. He says no he doesnt think we should ever be in eachothers lives again. and thats it i had no more contact since january. i think bout him all time, and i just wish he would talk to me. Am i mad to cling on to hope he may get in touch?
20090305040131AAOyR52	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she interested, or just being friendly?	I'm not saying how old I am because it's embarrassing to write something like this at my age. I graduated high school before y2k.       I've known this girl for maybe a year and a half through a mutual friend, but we really haven't had much to do with each other beyond being in the same social circles.     So recently my friend let slip that she(my friends' friend) liked me and wanted to get to know me better, and so far her actions are backing that statement up. Our group went to eat and she offered me a ride (which wasn't necessary at all) and an invite to a small get-together at her place (never been invited before), among other minor things like requests to join her social networking site.       I know this is all really minor stuff as far as clues go, but that's what's throwing me off. Why get to know me? She's the type that can have whatever she wants. She not only has the looks and personality to attract the best, but is so talented and driven that she doesn't even NEED anyone else around. I am, obviously, kinda taken by her, but was under the assumption that I couldn't compete and just forgot about it quite a while ago.        But here we are, nonetheless. I'm erring on the "she's just being nice" side, but I plan on asking her to out to a movie this weekend when we all meet up again. You know, "just to get to know each other" to see what happens?      Good move? Bad? Opinions? I'm an idiot?(don't answer that)

20090305042000AAumYuQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Single mom's dating question...?	I am a mom of a 31/2 yr old boy and I have been dating this single guy for a yr. After a year, he started to spend time with my son. He asked me to give him the time to learn about having a kid in the picture. I first I didn't agree cuz I believe my son deserved unconditional love and the someone comes into the picture will just love him no matter what. But I also realized I can't expect him to jump in be a daddy of my son. A month past and I shed many tears and here is heartache: He likes my son and my son likes him very much (part of my son seems want a father figure in his life too). He plays with my son and buys my son little things and suddenly one evening, my son hugged him a say "I love you". they were playing so he just playfully said "how come?!" My son was lost and looking at me for guitance. I didn't know what to say so I said "it is ok". My bf treats spending time with my son like dating - he now "likes" my son, not "loves" my son yet. I am hurt for the rejection my son took. There are times he wants to do things without my son, and my choice usually is being with my son. Then my bf spends time with his guy friends. I see that he is taking his time learning about "us" (my son and me). I agreed to give him time, but it is hard for me to see things like the "l love you" instance. What are your thoughts over this? Should I allow his continuence of learning about us? I sometime feel like quiting because I don't want my son to take his "unsure" love. I feel I am loosing it at the moment. Please provide your thoughts and advice. Thanks!

She told my friends it was me who told her the things. Now, they are friends with her but not ME!

Call and let her know how I feel, or leave it alone. I was hoping that everything could have transpired without drama, but she loves sticking her foot in it...and just had to feed his ego.   please help. I don't even talk to him, or dont care to.

20090305043700AAFQ4aE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	PLEASE HELP ME :( (I love him)?	I sooo love him but hes such a hard person :( hes sweet and lovely but u know sometimes he just gets depressed I tried so many ways to make him say whats wrong but it's impossibe he keeps saying that hes fine but hes not. I also get many bad thoughts about why hes sad and it ruins me and destroys me. I see the world threw dark eyes thinking he doesnt love me anymore. Sometimes he gets in panic saying I don't love him with some hard clues. Hes kind of weirdo sometimes but I don't care since I love him blindly. Now I decided to be a little more not active in talking with him cus everytime I do this he gets more like caring and like abit undepressed as he was, but now I tried and he didn't! I will still try to do it for some days, cus thats the only idea I thought of so far :( it's just impossibe to make him say what he doesnt want to so dont tell me to talk to him about it, I tried many times before. I blame myself about him being sad I think I was cold to him but I cant find a moment to be warm to him I tried to talk to him about his depression and I said that I'm sorry if I upset him but he always says hes fine so I can't continiue to talk to him about it >.<  I now often think I could just die and everything would be so fine and I wouldnt have this terrible pain and thoughts :( Whenever I walk down stairs I wish I could fall and crash my head and die (I'm not mad, I'm just emotional and I'm NOT emo or something) Well ppl please I beg u help. Hope u help me :(

I wish it was me she liked but u know its not and i think me not tellin her how i feel and waiting a bit 2 see how there relationship goes is the best idea? and 2 not tell her how i feel? as long as shes happy right
20090305044330AAk8oUD	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do i do...These two big girls going to bash me!?	There are two girls at my school who hate my guts and both want to bash me. I am 5"4, weigh 110 lbs (50 kgs) and they are both quite tall and also got quite a bit of fat on them. For weeks now they have been saying they are going to bash me becoz ones bf asked if i wud give him a headjob and I of course said no, and so he went around telling everyone i asked him if he wanted one. They always say right in front of me how they are practising boxing so they can beat me up. To be honest im not very hard to beat up probably one ounch and i wud be knocked out, but if i tried to fight them, i wudnt even be able to reach their head lol. What do i do? Tell the school... alot of ppl might laugh at me. I feel like telling the police, cuz i seriously think they are going to hurt me really bad, and have had some emotional damage on me bcoz now everyone in the school hates me and bullies me. I feel like a shud drop out.       What do i do?   And how do i fight a fat girl...If i need to?

20090305050208AAtolST	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think i have a cool story to tell. what do u think?	im a 21 year old male from Mi. (april 4-9 2005) my junior spring break trip in cancun. i went to another hotel on the 7th i met the most beautiful and different girl that i had ever met she was a senior from northern NY .we hit it off from the start. everything was great between us. she was into me and i was into her. i ended up staying the night. the next night was about the same thing as the 7th. the next week we started exchanging instant messages for about a month. she was close so going and seeing me with a friend in the summer but it ended up not happening and we just sowly stopped talking.i was in a long relationship but i still cant get her out of my head. i still have dreams about her. i IM her a year ago(i think spring 07) it was nothing special. and she facebooked me last winter(dec 06) but we talked once and that was it then.im thinkin about tryin to talk to her more but i guess im wondering if i should keep trying or stop.realy wish i had more room to type this out better.pleace comment.   it says i sent this 11 months ago so i dont know where i was at in my thought process. i did try to IM her agian on april 7th 08 and it was still small talk and nothing special. she has been in a relationship for quite a while now.   i could go more into itbut i think thats enough.   just seeing if this is a good story or not. it was a big part of one of the best times of my life. i did post a similar msg about a year ago on this and i was serious. just felt bored and wanted to do it again.   i find myself still thinking about the girl and the time. i think i always go back to that when ever my social life is not too exciting.

20090305045611AArlmMr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation....?	I have been with my boyfriend since June last year I am still friends with my ex who last month had his 21st birthday. I brought some drink and went round to his flat the intention was to have a drink then go out but we put on a film and talked obviously whilst drinking. I look on my ex as a friend and only as a friend and after we had drunk quite a bit he tried to kiss me and I totally freaked out and ended up shuting myself in the bathroom for ages he managed to coax me out and we continued to drink. In the morning I woke up in his bed thinking omg we didnt and was pretty sure we hadnt until i saw an empty wrapper in the bin obviously felt really awful but still wasnt sure. I have spoken to him since and he says we did. Also I spoke to the current boyfriend a couple of times in the night and everytime I was out the room on the phone the ex managed to "accidently" break glasses which seems odd to me. Problem is I dont know if anything happened or not given I know I totally freaked when he tried to kiss me, but if it did he still had his senses about him telling him to be careful but he knew I have a boyfriend, I am not trying to shift blame but that is wrong. I feel really awful and not having a clue how the night went in the middle that I dont remember what do I do with my boyfriend do I tell him I may have cheated on him, I did cheat on him, or nothing at all? I really dont want this relationship to end which obviously would be a very real possiblilty... I am not sure if I have explained right but constructive advice would be great please

20090305050435AATsbGg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	An ex has come back into my life. Should we give this a try? What are our chances?	An ex I dated when I was 23 (he is 2 years older than me) came back into my life 1 month ago. There was nothing too bad about the break-up. We had originally worked together but it had become long distance. We dated for 2.5yrs but we both had difft plans and were not going to be in the same place in time soon.      He has taken initiative and reached out to me over the years. I would see he has done this and I've been relatively responsive but not too much more than that.      I'm 31 now and he is 33 and says he wants to settle down now. We have decided to see each other again because I brought it up. But he is also planning to move 1.5 hours away now (philly) and start his own business (it is cheaper outside of NY). That's why I felt I had to say it. He quit his job just recently and he is really in between in quite a few ways. He has been traveling a lot so I've seen him in spurts. He finishes his final trip March 16th. He said he has held back now because of his inbetween-ness now.      What do you think? I wanted to go slow, but is this too tricky? Experiences and thoughts?

I am so confused.This is my 1st real relationship with someone and it's almost our 11th month anniversary. We don't celebrate our anniversaries compared to other people who do. Every anniversary is like a regular day. I just want to feel special and pampered. I hate telling him that he makes me feel unspecial and that I'm the guy in the relationship. I had to say it b/c it hurt me so much. I do'nt want to be taken for granted. I want to feel special and I am not feeling it. He doesn't surprise me or take me out to places. I usually take him to places and I surprise him. Am I the man of the relationship? What should I do? I know he loves me, but I don't know how to feel. We talked about marriage too.I fear if we get married, I will be the one supporting the family.I tell him to go back to college, but he always saids he will but he never actually take action to do it. I really love him but if he won't change I think I might have to leave him. What should I do?

He said that he wasn't ready to have a girlfriend yet. i understood, because he just went through a bad break up. he's been extremely nice since then.   a few weeks later i see him with another girl. at first i think they're just friends, but i start to notice that he stopped paying attention to me   i finally figured out that their together      we've been best friends for a long time. What do i do, and how will this effect our friendship?

20061019173407AAYWJV9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok...What Should I think of this...??	Alrite, I am pretty sure but, yet uncertain to make that decision final...      So, I have this teacher and when I get to class, he always teases me and pokes fun at me.  Everytime he sees my face he smiles like huge, and then when the whole class is in session, he always tries to get close to me yet not actually physically touch me..so far.  When I talk to him he always listens to me and i will be honest, he seems to appear that he has a attraction to girls with physical disfunctions..Don't get me wrong i am not handicap but, i look slightly different.. I don't have that scary stalker feeling but, sometimes i really do wonder if he is attracted to me on a extremely high level.  He even has made a comment to me- face to face in these exact words "I like you just the way you are, don't change."  Anyone help me on this one and tell me their story(s)???  I had a nother teacher like me before and i know he did because he gave me a boquet of flowers but i threw them on the highway...HELP ME!!

20061027053227AAamUm8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my boyfriend often nicer to other people than to me?	My boyfriend & I have been dating for 6 months. It started out great. We're both argumentative, so we fight a lot. Now I try to resolve things before they turn into a fight. If I try to call a time-out, he keeps going until he says everything he wants to say. If someone else gives him constructive criticism, he'll be cool about it, but if I do it, he usually gets offended or disregards it.       Sometimes he's still really sweet, but I never know when he's going to get mad about something. It's like evrything has to be his idea or it's not as good. I realize a lot of men are like this. How can I get him to see that we have a problem & he needs to take some of the responsibility? I don't want to be a doormat & don't want us to hurt each other w/ our words. If I try to ignore him when he's being grumpy (defense mechanism & to let him cool off), he says I'm pouting. Why am I always the bad guy? What's his deal & what am I supposed to do?

20061230091004AA8nTnV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Femme divorcée avec des enfants retrouve son amour mais lui marié? Comment proceder?	Mariée 10 ans+ et maintenant divorcée depuis 1 an.Voilà, je retrouve (par le skype) mon grand amour de jeunesse marié et il me dit qu'il m'aime toujours, lui aussi. Qu'il savait que je vais l'appeler un jour. Que je suis son grand amour. Que je suis la seule à lui avoir fait "des choses". Qu'il est retourné dans son pays natal, s'est marié et resté avec son épouse de là-bas à cause des enfants. Je l'ai connu avant mon mari mais je n'avais pas assez de courage de partir vivre à l'étranger. Je vivais avec lui pendant 2 ans. Maintenant il veut me rencontrer et avoir un enfant avec moi. Nous communiquons par téléphone uniquement. J'ai essayé de réflechir. Je vais lui demander de choisir entre moi et sa femme. Il n'a pas parlé de quitter sa famille. D'abord je veux le rencontrer et voir si "tout" existe toujours. Voir ou nous y sommes vraiment. Il a des enfants, aussi. Je suis en train de faire un saut immense, certes. Quoi pensez-vous? Comment avancer? Experiences, avis, conseils..?

She's a girl, I'm a guy, we're in high school. What's a "safe" way to initiate some physical contact? I don't want to seem "weird" like start holding her hand all of a sudden, I doubt she'd appreciate that lol. She shows some signs of being interested, but I want to amplify those possible feelings she has for me, and I know touch is a great way to do that. I often put my hand on her shoulder or something when I say something, but how can I do more without scaring her away?

20070121233211AAam4ja	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like him, but I think I really messed up this time...?	Me and this guy I really like, but who considers me just a friend, went out to the movies with all of our friends, and we all went out to a bar afterwards for a bit of dinner. We were there for ages and eventually me and this guy were left. He recently got a girlfriend, by the way. Anyway, we went out for a walk, and he asked me who I liked now, since I recently broke up with my boyfriend. And I told him that I really liked him. He said that was ok, but we were just friends, and he already had a girlfriend. Then, I don't know why, but I told him that his girlfriend didn't really like him (even though it isn't true), and that she was just using him. He went all silent, said goodbye, and left. He hasn't talked to me since then, and I don't know if it was the drink (I only had 2 glasses of wine), or what, but now I've messed up and I don't know what to do...please help!

20070228030358AAxf2fd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is why women are so hard to deal with?	Okay a female coworker of mine and I getting along very well usually. However, when I don't pay much attention to her she never agrees with me, doesn't laugh at anything I do, and is distant. But if I pay attention to her she is much the opposite. The difference is night and day. When I say I don't pay much attention to her I don't mean I flat out ignore her, i'm just not in a talkative mood. I'll say a few things to her, just not kiss her butt or make her feel like the only in the room. When I am a little distant she just flat out shuts me off and will totally disagree with everything I do,but if I do the same exact thing on a day that we talk alot, she thinks it's the funniest thing in the world. What's up with her?
20070225222618AAhKZab	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	He has stolen my heart. :(?	I sent a break-up message to my boyfriend about two weeks ago. He stays in the states, and I’m locating at the other side of the earth. Sad to say, it’s a distant and online relationship. I know to some of you, you will think it’s pretty silly to even have it in the first place. I used to despise of this kind of idea as well, but until my best mate became a living proof.       He hasn’t been online for nearly a month now. But before that, he did inform me that he’s moving out to his friend’s house, and he won’t be having any internet connection for a month or so. Before he moved out, he left a mail to my myspace. In that message, he includes his friend’s house number and telling me that he’s glad he met me. I was happy when I saw the message. But two weeks later, I realised that online relationship, still didn’t seems right to me, so I took up my courage and sent a break-up message to him. But I felt the heartache after I clicked “Send”. It’s the same heartache that I first felt it when

20070401121550AA9GR3n	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need help???	My mom was diagnosed when I was 6. After the first six months and probably 20 surgeries, she couldn’t talk, feed herself, and she could barely walk. My brothers, my dad and I were caring for her like she was a baby. For a year she was a “vegetable state” and we would then have to change diapers. Those two years were hard on all of us. I don’t think I have ever gotten over the devastation it brought. My mom died two years later when I was 8 right before I started 3rd grade. I was my mom’s “little princess.” My life hasn’t been going to good from there. I am 15 years old now and live in a small Mormon town with only a couple neighbors with my dad and 2 brothers. We are the only non Mormons close by.  Just over a year ago we had a family of 6 move in next door to us. They have 2 girls (10 and 12) and 2 boys (6 and 8). At first I wanted nothing to do with the mother. I’ve been that way since my mom passed away.

20070325110327AA6jAfK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What could this mean?	I liked a girl, she lead me on then said she didn't like me. We talked only for four months. After the fourth month I told a friend about how she told me about her falling in love with someone else and not me. She found out and never talked to me again. 11 months later, I've missed her and it seemed like she missed me too because she was always looking at me and sometimes she would say hi back to me. I thought maybe she'd talk to me since that was so long ago and we can be friends again. So I went to talk to her but she completely ignored me and I left her. Two days later (today) I looked at her page where she had changed her headline to simply "wondering why..." I think it may not be anything to do with me and it's not such a big deal or it could be about something else. If it has to do with me it's probably about why did I even try to talk to her. What could it mean if it does have to do with me?

I'm not sure he was ready for the move because it wasn't something we talked about, it was because of a situation I was having at home. Anyway, I constantly catch him on craigslist looking at their personals site and I've confronted him about it. He tells me that he just wants to see what's out there. I told him that if he continues looking at the site then I was leaving. Recently, I caught him looking again. Does he even care? He tells me he loves me but he does stuff like look at personal sites and stuff. Then when I talk about our future, he starts "joking around" saying we're not getting married or having kids. what should I do? I love him but i'm looking for someone I can have a future with.

I happened to glance at him and he was looking at me - and he looked away very quickly.      First of all, is that look anything to base a suspicion on being liked (him liking me) upon? (I still catch him looking at me every once in a while... But I look at him more now.)      And also, I really didn't like him before this, but I hadn't noticed him really.

20070324211015AAYyKnc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The end of an era?	Two years ago, I feel in love with a much younger man just as I was leaving town. Even though I left the area, somehow, we carried on a long-distance relationship and fell in love. However, just at the end, right as he was about to move, I balked, mostly because my job fell apart. It turned into a terrible phone break-up, with him saying terrible things to me he probably didn't mean, and me getting hurt. Now, after a year, we are talking again. Things seemed to go well for a few days, but then, I became angry about the past, ans we got into an argument, in which he asked me heatedly why I didn't stay in NYC a few months longer, and why I didn't move to let him be with me when he was ready? I also got angry. Then, he seemed not to want to talk as much, and to draw serious boundaries.

OK so i have know this girl since 7th grade and were both in 11th grade now. this school year we have grown really close and are the best of friends. she has had relationship problems. she broke up with her boyfriend 2 months ago and she said she is ready to move on. i have alwayz been there for her whenever she has had relationship problems and she really likes me as a friend.  i have been thinking about asking her out and i had decided i was gonna do that monday at school yesterday she told me that there is a nice guy that she MIGHT start to like but its not a sure thing. she told me that the guy asked her for her phone number. we both pretend that she and i are going out/breaking up just 4 fun. but ppl have told me 2 ask her out cuz she might like me and we are really close. what should i do?? is hope lost because of what she said about the other guy??

20070319105107AAykJR9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship help needed?	my "theory" was to use one guy to get over the other, my high school sweetheart, but it back fired. i fell for the replacement guy who is NOT my type, he's mean, and talks funny and treats me like crap. we were together for a short time but broke up a few months ago. we've remained friends (sorta) and then saturday, i drunkenly showed up lost on his street in the middle of the night. he made sure i got home and then in the morning, i explained myself and said goodbye for good, no more being friends either. so now, i revert back to my high school sweetheart, the one person who i was 150% completely myself with and in love with. is it normal to think of "the one that got away?" it's been nearly three years since our relationship ended and yet, he's still in my heart and none of the feelings have gone away. should i lay my heart on the line and tell him that i still feel this way?
