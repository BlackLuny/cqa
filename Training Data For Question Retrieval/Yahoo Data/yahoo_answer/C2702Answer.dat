I hope you love and care for your new Friend forever :)|`|bsqSaXhQaa	You can't base the answer of this question just on how cute the dog is.<br>  <br>  It depends on what lifestyle you yourself live.<br>  An active one? <br>  How much room do you have? Do you have a yard or an apartment?<br>  Do you tolerate shedding/drooling?<br>  Do you have kids?<br>  Do you want to train it or want it already trained?<br>  If you're going to train it, do you want it to be easy or a challenge?<br>  Some breeds are more prone to health issues.<br>  <br>  My suggestion, do research.<br>  Even pay a visit to your local shelter or animal rescue. Chances are, the dog for you can be found there and he's waiting for a home and someone to love and to be loved.|`|sUH902cDaa	I've got an english cocker spaniel and I think there great for a first time dog!

Dog breeds are like human races, it's the same genetic make-up for every breed/race.  A dog breed is just its outward appearance, its phenotype.  Personality is epigenetic, meaning it forms without help from genes or genetic traits.<br>  <br>  If you are set on getting a puppy, please get one that is at most 8 to 9 weeks old.  This is important.  At 8 weeks old, your puppy has just entered a stage of life called the 'critical period'.  This period of time lasts 'til the age of 16 weeks.  During this time, you should socialize your pup with your other pets.  Be sure to reinforce positive behaviors your puppy shows around your pets.  In this critical period, your dog must be exposed to every thing he or she will encounter in its adult life.  This is also an ideal time to begin training your pup.<br>  <br>  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	This is not a question to ask here. You are talking about a life long commitment. I suggest going to AKC.org and looking at all the breeds. make a list of your favorites. Then get on infodog.com and find a dog show near you and then go , plan to spend the day and watch those dogs in the ring then talk to owner handlers about the traits of those dogs. Theey will help you choose what is right for you based on space, time, dedication to grooming and exercise.  That way you will have a lifelong companion just right for you.|`|IsQckOXraa	get an english bulldog!<br>  they are so adorable i have one and i love her to death!<br>  get a girl though because they tend to be less drooly<br>  even though they are sterotyped as being unactive they love to play and are good guard dog while being adorable!<br>  pics-<br>  baby<br>  <a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/emedia/wtop/14/1438/143897.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wtopnews.com/emedia/wtop/14/1...</a><br>  adult<br>  <a href="http://www.cedarlanebulldogs.com/opening3.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.cedarlanebulldogs.com/opening...</a><br>  make sure when you get a dog that you try to adopt one from a local shelter!

IMPvzBk1aa	I don't think he hates the cold.  I actually think he loves the cold, and feels much more energized in cold weather than he does when it is hot.<br>  You'll have to look at his diet to see if he is getting too much energy feed, which would be cereal gains....especially sweet feed.  I would get him off of all cereal grains and replace those calories with more hay, or sources of digestible fiber such as beet pulp, or equine senior feed like Purina.  He is obviously getting more energy from his feed than he needs.  Hay ferments in the hind gut and is all he needs to sustain him and keep him warm in winter.  So, unless he needs more calories to maintain weight, good quality hay and a salt and mineral block may be all he needs.|`|RloOJ43haa	Is he getting any turnout in the winter? It sounds like he needs a lot more. He clearly has a lot of pent up energy. Also, it sounds to me like he loves the cold and that it invigorates him.|`|BIshtm7oaa	Cooler weather always tends to make my horses a little more rowdy than usual. I'd try turning him out more often, using a blanket if you don't already, and then using a rump rug or quarter sheet when you ride him, and a fleece cooler afterward (that is, if it is the cold that bothers your horse). Other than that just some general controlling techniques such as circles, etc, need to be used so that he understands that he can't go bucking down the field just because its cold out.|`|wGOtDZ0Uaa	my old mare was exactly the same, she hated being stabled in the<br>  winter, I would only bring her in if the weather was really bad, the<br>  smell of the winter and the cold would cause her to go barmy!<br>  She was once in due to an injury, I popped her in a small exercise<br>  paddock while I mucked out, I heard a lot of excitement in the field<br>  and she had jumped a large hedge and ditch she was bucking and<br>  snorting flat out around the field, her leg dressings flying in the wind,<br>  so it may be the same with your horse, maybe he just wants to be<br>  out with his mates for a few hours.|`|YtBzRAxMaa	If you are taking him away from his pals in the turnout and asking him to "work" all alone then yup - he is the kind of horse that will freak.<br>   You'll need a buddy to work with (pref HIS buddy).|`|RGqs6ySGaa	BUY HIM A SNUGGIE!|`|bdB1jq21aa	buy him a rug!

AA10029366	It might be a smell he's responding to, or it might be a nervous habit.<br>  <br>  If your vet thinks the Bulldog's skin is healthy, you can try applying Bitter Apple or another type of "no chew" spray (I like Tea Tree Oil, because it also soothes the skin) to discourage the licking.<br>  <br>  You can find these things at your vet clinic, or even PetsMart/PetCo.|`|sW8eg01saa	no i don't know why your dachshund would do that but you might want to talk with your vet about the sores though|`|FaPrr8bbaa	I had to ask a dog trainer about my dachshund licking the mouth of my other dachshund because the little one was starting to growl at being licked.  The trainer said that the licker was being submissive to the other dog.  I was told to tell the licker NO.  Its working.
xe7mylLmaa	Ideally, the iguana would have more supervision and interaction that that.  However, it certainly sounds like your husbandry would be far superior to that of your brother's and that is important above all else for the health of the iguana.  <br>  <br>  As long as he is fed and toilet trained, an iguana can get by on his own just fine if your apartment is set up for it.  Many iguana owners do work day jobs or go to school, leaving less time for bonding and interaction with the animal.  It is not the ideal situation but it can work.  Although iguanas can and will bond with their human owners, they seem to get by just fine as solitary animals.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	That's tough. First off, I think you should talk to your brother. You do need his permission to take him with you, right? If he isn't taking proper care of him, and you can, I say go for it. I like to think the more you handle him, the better. Iguanas are known to be a bit aggressive and feisty at times. Without regular handling, they may go "wild". Yes, he will be fine at home alone but he still needs attention. Iguanas can get up to 6 feet in length too, so be sure you can accomadate that bad boy too before taking on this huge responsibility. I'm glad you've done your research, you should talk to your brother now. Good luck.
ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	The cost depends on the vet, and the area where you live.  Rural vets are usually cheaper than city vets, vets in expensive neighborhoods will likely be costlier, many cities have low cost spay/neutuer clinics.  Call around.<br>  <br>  I've had many older males fixed, they were all their usual selves by the next day.<br>  <br>  It takes several months for the hormones to wear off.  Besides that, the dogs now are in the habit of not liking each other, so neutering is unlikely to stop the fighting.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Your best bet would be to call some of the Vets in your area & see how much they charge.  Prices vary from one Vet to another & from on location to another.  So if I told you what they charge here it may be completely different where you are.  By calling around you will get exact prices & not guesses.|`|bQ6G9UzMaa	Krissii, I like the look of a pinscher. They are so cute.|`|6sXG3Plkaa	Since the dog is older the fighting and marking may not stop.  Now its more of a habit for them.  I got a 2 yr old dog neutered last year he marked everywhere and that was what I was told that it might help with the marking it might not at that age (luckily it did).  I would definitely go ahead and get the 1 yr old none now too.  <br>  <br>  For the recovery I got a older dog from the local shelter and had to have him fixed.  He recovered very quickly from it.<br>  <br>  Cost will differ from vet to vet.  Also check in to see if there is a low cost clinic in your area.  We have one here spay and neuter clinic very low priced most of the local vets even give discount coupons to use the clinic there.

If it's not treated then your dog will go blind and the eyeballs may become so diseased that they have to be removed. You need an antibiotic ointment that is designed for the eye area, and you need to apply it several times daily. For obvious reasons, I can't promise anything, but if you can get hold of an ointment that is used for this purpose on farm animals then it should do the trick. However, the eyes may never recover properly, or be left with blue scarring.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your dog, I wish you all the best.|`|b807f13da6719d3e3a726d7eb53fb59daa	Sounds like your dog may have an infection in her eyes,or could be cateracs.It depends on how long it has had this problem.If just recently occurred,try using some "Terramycin" antibiotic ophthalmic ointment that can be purchased at any feed store,use as directed on instructions and if nothing serious this should clear them up,but if not,sorry but you must take her to vet,or she could loose her sight.|`|f6ecd3c66fedef73b16d3510881b47f6aa	It could be premature cataracts (sp?)  could be a number of things!

You should try to praise the dog very time she DOES urinate so she will understand. You also have to monitor her water intake, even if she has water 24/7 she might not be drinking it. Change the water as often as you can. Dogs with a bladder infection are the opposite, and leak urine everywhere.

You can also try your local paper and see if there are any ads 'free to a good home.'<br>  ALSO, you probably would have good luck doing this: go to local vets and let them know you are interested in a Ragdoll.

The breeder will ask about your lifestyle, and why you want that particular breed, along with giving you tons of first hand information about the breed you want.  She will then put you on a waiting list (if that is the breeder you choose) and help you pick out a puppy that will go best with your family.

c72889519cdd1e7be41daeda8dd32349aa	well i had the same trouble. The trick is to do a little research on chihuahuas and tell them all thepros of having a chihuahua(for instance how chihuahuas require less care, shed less, do not need walked, ect.).

If your mom has so much experience with dogs and cats, when she tells you stuff like they will be a nuisance she is probably right! And by the way, how much is $500 in Canadian money? If you and the groomer are really really persistant though, you could get the groomer to have a 'chat' with your parents trieng to convince them.

0s6Ifgmdaa	Thunderstorms may be frightening because of the noise and because of the electrical activity which your dog may be hyper sensitive to.  <br>  <br>  You can try putting him in the car in the garage with you.  Sit with him and see if this helps.  The car dissipates the electricity plus it provides extra muffling of the noise.<br>  <br>  Distractions like a long-lasting treat (smear the inside of a rubber toy with cream cheese or peanut butter for example) can help as well.  If you think a storm is coming, you can try exercising him more so that he can just sleep through it.  <br>  <br>  Ask your vet if a small dose of melatonin can help him snooze.|`|d985649c9ebb575112146640d0cc9e0daa	Is he crate/cage trained? If so, put him in his crate/cage and put a blanket over it. This will calm him, especially if that is where he sleeps like mine does.<br>  <br>  If not, then if the room that he typically sleeps in does not have a lot of windows, take him in there. This is his comfort zone. Take a toy or some training treats, or if he likes to be brushed, take a brush. The darker it is in the room, the more comforted he will be. Maybe turn the lights off and bring a flashlight or lantern in the room. Sit him on his bed (or yours, if he sleeps with you) and sit close to him. Pet him, brush him, play with him with a toy, or even use this time to work on training with the treats. This will help keep him calm and distracted.<br>  <br>  Whenever the thunder/lightning scares him, soothe him with your voice and gently pet him. When he calms down, praise him and/or give him a treat. Anytime the thunder/lightning sounds loudly and he doesn't freak out, praise him and/or give him a treat. He will slowly learn that there is nothing to worry about. You just have to comfort him.<br>  <br>  You also have to remain calm during the storm. If at any time you startle because of the storm, he will panic since he uses you as his comfort anchor since you are considered a pack leader, if his pack leader is scared, then he will be scared.<br>  <br>  Also, don't be too worried if it doesn't work right off. He's an old dog, and he's been scared of storms for a long time, it will take some work. I don't think it's likely he could give himself a heart attack, but all you can do is keep him as calm as possible.<br>  <br>  If the medicine you spoke about works at times and not at others, it may have to do with when it is administered. If you know it's supposed to storm that day, go ahead and give it to him earlier so it'll have time to get in his system before the storm scares him. If he gets scared before the medicine starts working, it's not going to do much good.<br>  <br>  The shirt idea someone else mentioned might help too if he has been trained to wear clothes. If would make him more secure. Of course, if he's never worn clothes before, it'll only make it worse.<br>  <br>  I hope my suggestions help. Good luck with this. I hope it works.|`|NIB3fFRTaa	I had a Beagle that was terrified not just of thunderstorms but of the street sweeper that went by at 2AM twice a week.  He apparently thought the flashing monster was coming to get him and would hide and cry in terror until we came to get him.  Poor baby.<br>  <br>  What I found, and what the vet told us, is that giving pills right at the cusp or after the 'threat' has started won't calm the animal down.  They are already so worked up and so full of adreneline that their systems just override the medication.<br>  <br>  You might want to try giving him the medication half an hour prior to the storm.  Sometimes it can be hard to tell, but a lot of times you can tell by the air and sometimes even weather reports if you have one coming in in the near future.  Giving them the medication earlier has more of an affect and tends to make them calmer and sleepier instead of hyper.<br>  <br>  You can also talk to your vet about the medication.  It may be possible to increase the dosage slightly or try a different kind of medication that he may respond to better.<br>  <br>  If you have a basement/cellar you can talk him down there to wait out the storm.  The sounds should be weaker and less threatening.  It may also be a good idea to put him into an animal crate.  This keeps him in one place and less likely to injure himself. Have the crate next to you so he can see you but leave him in it till the storm passes.  Some animals even like being in smaller confined areas because they feel safer.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	None of my dogs had this problem, but you could ask your vet, an animal comunicater, or a professional dog trainer|`|AA10021093	Put him in the bathroom, thunderstorms have a tendency to build up static electricity in the air, and some dogs are hyper-sensitize to it, and the bathroom fixtures will help him to discharge the static .|`|v1jnIsHnaa	My Mom's cockapoo is terrified of thunderstorms.  This may sound odd but she puts a shirt on him to comfort him and puts him in a crate with a blanket over it.  He likes it in there and he feels safer.

If you act sorry for her she'll feel that energy and will continue to decline. Instead think positive. Find her favorite toys and treats and encourage her to come out of the house. Play with her a lot, exercise her daily. Keep her moving forward and focused on you instead of her surroundings.<br>  <br>  Take her out to a lot of new places. But take it slow. One new place a week, i think. And don't keep her there for too long. She'll be overwhelmed by the new sights, smells, and sounds and may just shut down on you. Watch her for signs of extreme discomfort (excessive shaking, tail completely tucked, slinking along on the ground) then take her home if you see them. <br>  <br>  Do NOT pet, or feed, or cuddle your dog when she is in this state. If she comes running to you, scared, and you pet her it is encouraging the behavior. Instead, ignore her and let her get comfortable on the floor by your feet with no insight from you. <br>  <br>  Don't drag her out either, that creates a negative experience for her. Instead calmly put a leash on her, line her up net to you and have her sit. When she seems calm and isn't trying to run away, calmly walk forward and bring her with you. If she pulls, give a tiny pop of the leash to get her attention and keep moving. She'll eventually follow. If she doesn't, get back into position and try again. Stay calm while doing this and the energy will feed into her and she'll become bolder.<br>  <br>  Exercise her every day. A minimum of sixty minutes a day is best. That will help drain her energy and she'll have less energy to make into anxiety.<br>  <br>  Google or look up Cesar Millan or Victoria Stillwell. Both are excellent  behaviorists that give free tips on their websites.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7jnLI40Taa	With a dog as terrified and abused as this, I would definitely look into getting a professional trainer or even a Behaviorist. <br>  <br>  This is something for the professionals. <br>  <br>  I have a fearful dog of noises, and plastic bags.

aCqSF87Raa	You call the vet and ask - then report the dog that bit your dog, unless it was your dog's fault it got bit (was on the other dog's property.) You may have to bring the dog in for shots (if you don't know whether the other dog was vaccinated) and treatment.|`|krXQaZAfaa	No, but he needs antibiotics and a possible rabies booster.<br>  <br>  ADD:  In that case... keep the wound open but be sure he cannot get to the area, OK?  Do not allow him to even lick the site!|`|mLt93HWeaa	don't bandage the wound yet, unless it's really bad. Dogs have something in their saliva that is a natural healer, so by licking their wound it should help it to get better quickly. Keep a close eye on it though, and if it starts to show any sign of infection then put antibiotic cream on (you may have to get this from your vet) and bandage the wound. Make sure it's kept clean, and hopefully mother nature will do her work!<br>  Good luck!|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	Disinfect the wound and put a dressing on it to stop possible infection, but that's just until you can get it to the vet.

The vet is critical, so please don't waste any time in getting there.<br>  Hope your dog will be alright!|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	The most important thing is to clean the wound - if you hav some betadine or chlorhexidine, or even dial soap.<br>  <br>   Not sure of the circumstances, but if the other dog is an unknown dog or a stray, keep in mind there could be diseases - including rabies.

ArBOK95aaa	there is a product called pill pockets.  They are amazing.  Very tasty to cats.  <br>  <br>  The pocket is a little big, and kitties tend to chew, so I break it apart and wrap it around the pill or even break the pill into tiny pieces and wrap tiny amounts of the pill pocket around it, and they gobble it down like treats.|`|1xwyCxdUaa	If its in pill form, you could try stuffing the pill in a treat.  The cat treat brand Greenies has a product called Greenies Pill Pockets.  My cat didn't fall for that though, so you might want to grind up the pill and sprinkle it in his food.  If its in liquid form, sometimes you have to get kind of firm with the cat.  The recommended way is to pull back their lips a little and inject the liquid into their mouth with an eye dropper.|`|4D7nhSHnaa	I would, if you don't already, for this brief time I would feed him a little canned food, put the pill in the soft food, just  make sure he eats all of it; problem should be solved.  I say this because my Bradley loves can food.  His main food is dry, but for a snack, I will open a can of food and give him a portion of it.  He always, always finish the canned food.<br>  The dry food is always there for him.  I think that will be a good way to get him to take the pills.|`|pLHxkBoAaa	What medicine is it? What was wrong with the cat?<br>  <br>  What type of medicine? (ie: pill, liquid...)|`|86dfaca280cb2d0df491bc6cbc638812aa	Depends on what form the medicine is in. If it's liquid, just put it in the eyedropper (which usually comes with liquid medicines) and open the cat's mouth and squirt. A little usually leaks out, but that's fine.<br>  <br>  If it's a pill, you can try wrapping it in something like cheese or bologna. Some animals are too smart for that trick, so you could just crush it up and mix it into wet food.|`|GMOYdjyKaa	If it is a pill try hiding it in a soft chewy treat. There is a new product  called Pill Pockets and you just insert the pill and they gobble it up. If the meds you are giving is a liquid, place the syringe in the corner of his mouth and squirt it, but not too fast. <br>  Best way to restrain a cat is to wrap it in a towel and make sure you get all 4 legs wrapped in the towel also.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	No matter how you hide the pill or flavor it, chances are he'll spit it back out. Here's how to do it and it's not cruel or mean. Since you've got help (family) have somebody get a good grip on him, preferably with a towel, so he can't back up. Then pry open the cat's mouth with one hand and and toss the pill as far back in his mouth as you can.. hold his mouth closed and massage his throat a bit. He'll swallow it. He won't choke.|`|KyLGRY81aa	What I do that works really well is if liquid meds mix some in like a teaspoon of tuna fish and give it too him.  If the meds are pills then crush them up (between two spoons works really good) then mix that in the teaspoon of tuna fish.  The fishy taste and smell masks the flavor of meds for the most part.  The don't even know they are being medicated, they just think they are getting a tasty treat!<br>  Hope this helps you! : )<br>  |`|AA12334740	If you go to the pet store they have a treat called pill pockets and you can put the pill in them, squeeze it closed and they will eat it.

I think that the pill pockets are good just if your cat doesn't know or can't smell it sometimes the pill falls out of the pocket and you have to keep doing it alot. If you do the canned food then I would take just a little and pack the pill in there just enough to cover the pill up My cats main food is dry so it's a really big thing for my cat. If you get two treats pack the pill in between the pill and then swish them together. my cat like freskies|`|VMY7No0eaa	You didn't say if it is pills or liquid.<br>  Pills > coat the pill with butter.

This is the way a mother cat carries her young and cats will not forget. You should be able to place the end of the syringe into the side of the cats mouth then squeeze.
Ykx1rz4Eaa	Actually i would suggest separating them because when i got my other kitten she was 2 monthes old and my other cat was 6 years old. I put my kitten in a seperate room for two weeks letting her and my other cat stick there paws under the door.

Make sure you do not show one more attention than the other.  Fact that the new cat is a Male also creates more of a problem.

Probably not too significant unless a cat shows an extreme change in stool color and consistency.
cfyHILMYaa	Try contacting your local animal control.  Many of them have humane traps that will let you rent for a small fee of about $10 a week.  Set up the trap with some food, when the kitty walks on a pressure plate the door will close.

There are cat traps available, but you must be careful, cats can carry rabies.|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	You can borrow or rent a live box trap from your local animal shelter or pound. It is just a big wire box with a pressure sensitive plate inside. All you need to do is put some cat food that smells good (like canned food or tuna) in the back of the trap and set it up. When the cat comes in and steps on the plate to get the food, the door closes and the cat is trapped inside without being hurt (although I'll warn you, they don't like being inside and may make a lot of noise or be really feisty when you catch them.)<br>  <br>  Wild, stray cats, known as "feral" cats are especially challenging because they have not been socialized with people, other than just knowing they can get food from people. Adult feral cats can often never be tamed, because they have been wild so long. Kittens, however, CAN be tamed if they are caught and socialized with people soon enough before they grow too much older. A common practice to deal with adult feral cats is a program called TNR, which stands for Trap, Neuter, Release. Animal rescue groups and societies know alot about this. What is done, is that a feral cat is caught and brought to a vet willing to do a spay or neuter surgery on the cat for a reduced price, or even for free. They will snip off a tiny portion of one of the cat's ears, or make a little hole or mark in it, so that if the cat is ever caught again, another vet can tell it has already been fixed. <br>  <br>  Below I have linked a couple of good sites with info on feral cats. There is also a great site out there called Alley Cat Allies that specializes in helping feral cats. They do have a website, www.alleycat.org  but for some reason it has not been working lately. You can still do a google search and find something about them on another website. The two I have linked below are good. <br>  <br>  You may also wish to look up and see if there are some local animal rescue groups or humane society in your area that can help you or give you advice about the cats.

Cats shouldn't be free fed - they should only be fed twice a day.  So toss the filthy plastic bowls and buy metal or ceramic bowls.<br>  <br>  To clear up the acne wipe the cat's chin with a Stridex pad.  If by "really bad" it's open sores and infected then take it to the vet to be checked out.  Do NOT put Stridex if there's open sores.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Yes, the chin acne is from anything that is made of plastic for a feeding bowl or water bowl.  Google up a ceramic or glass feeding bottle for cats and see what you get.  You made have to order it online.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Change to stainless steel bowls, and at this point I would be very leary of ceramic bowls, because likely these are made in China, and may contain lead.  The chin acne may clear up after you change bowls, but take the cat to the Vet.<br>  <br>  As for feeding, twice a day is enough, once every 12 hours, no need to leave food out all day.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Tony,<br>  <br>  You are getting good information from folks who suggest feeding moist food rather than dry. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about proper feline nutrition.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know there is a lot of controversy about dry vs moist food, but it is a fact that  cats are obligate carnivores needing meat as their main food source. Dry food was made for the convenience of humans,but it doesn't fit the bill for feline requirements. Cats do not need carbohydrate overloads, and dry food are chock full of them. Grain free- moist food is the best type of food to give your kitty to keep him happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  For two  great articles about optimum feline nutrition, visit these two websites, both written by veterinary experts in the field.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a><br>  <br>  The average 10-12 pound cat does well on 6  oz of moist food a day.  You don't want to overfeed an older cat, who's activity level may be far less than a younger cat.  Both my 9 year-old cats get 6 oz and are doing great. Since most cats prefer to eat smaller amounts frequently, and I work at home, I equally divide their portions into 4 meals, and they are doing great.<br>  <br>  Don't forget that obesity is one of the leading causes for many serious medical conditions, including kidney disease, so do be careful about the amount of food you are feeding.  Since you did not mention how much your cat weighs, or his breed and size,  the 6. oz recommendation is for cats averaging 10 lbs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and you are not being overly worried. You are being very cautious and careful about your cat. <br>  <br>  I think the articles will help a lot to reassure you that you are doing the right thing, nutrtionally, for your kitty. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association<br>  <br>  Edit: Wellness cat food is an excellent product. It is grain free and made of human grade meat. It comes in 3 oz cans and 5.5. oz cans. My cats prefer the 3 oz cans. They are slightly differently processed, in fact.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	What I do is have dry out all the time and only give wet in the morning and evening. The amount is equal to one small can per cat (I have three). Make sure you keep their water fresh every day and they get plenty of exercise (play with them).|`|K0uTjeWiaa	It is not too much and he can even get more. Canned food can be left out during the day too. Good for you for doing your research. Stay away from gravy|`|UNFxjNHkaa	wet food is not bad for your cat at all - disregard the answers that say that dry food is healthier.<br>  <br>  Cats evolved to eat meat, not cereal.<br>  <br>  <br>  "The natural diet of cats is meat.  Cats are meat eaters, designed to thrive on a wide variety of small prey animals, eaten fresh and whole. Their natural diet is high in water and protein, with a moderate amount of fat, and a very low percentage of carbohydrate.<br>  Dry cat food is high in grain.  A diet of dry food is high in carbohydrate, between 35 and 50 percent. "Diet" and "Lite" foods have even more.  Dry food contains almost no water. Dry cat food is convenient to feed, and relatively inexpensive, but it's the opposite of the natural diet of cats. Cats have no dietary need for any carbohydrate.<br>  <br>  Cats need to get water from their food.<br>  <br>  Cats are descended from feline desert dwellers. They couldn't stroll over to the watering hole for a drink, and cat tongues are not very well designed for drinking water. <br>  <br>  Cats are adapted to obtain most of their water from their prey, which contains more than 75 percent water. Cats who eat dry food consume only half the water they need, compared to those that eat wet food, and live in a state of chronic dehydration.<br>  <br>  The common health problems of cats are related to diet."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.articlealley.com/article_16231_54.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlealley.com/article_1623...</a>   <-- my source<br>  <br>  Please read that website for more info|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Two cans a day is probably about right, depending on his size.  If he eats it all, and isn't getting overweight, that should be fine.<br>  <br>  May be try leaving him a little dry food down during the day as well if you are concerned, with plenty of water.  A small amount of dry food won't affect his kidneys (as long as he has access to water), and will help keep his teeth strong and clean.<br>  <br>  If he starts to put on weight, just slowly cut back on the amount you are feeding him.|`|QLopvWKDaa	My cat gets 1/2 a small can in the morning and the other 1/2 at dinner. <br>  <br>   I do leave dry food and water out for her all day- cats are natural snackers.<br>  <br>  The dry food helps clean the teeth of tartar.<br>  <br>  Since your cat is 16 years old- I wouldn't change the diet much- just add the 1/2 can of wet food twice a day. <br>  <br>  When my cat was about 18 years old, I changed her to all wet food, because I thought her teeth hurt too much to eat the dry- she ended up with painful gas and the vet told me to quit messing with her diet! She had already been happy and healthy.|`|ZlfPl6B1aa	Give the cat a half a can of wet food in the morning & leave some dry food out for it to eat too..then at night give it the other half of the wet food..<br>  <br>  you aren't worried too much..you have a Senior Cat, who you love. I fuss over my kitten TONS and she's only 10 months old..(11 months in 5 days, momma's baby's growing up too fast. =[..)<br>  <br>   Do not give him 2 cans of wet cat food a day, he is going to get REALLY heavy and that can cause major problems--just like obesity in human can. Diabetes, heart conditions, you name it, cats can have issues like that too.<br>  <br>  Always speak to your vet when you change your cat's food. You should intergrate his food so that you don't change it too quickly--otherwise they can vomit,( cats are notorious for this..as im sure you know, your cat's 16!)|`|oTmylEGUaa	My cat eats so much food it's ridiculous.

What size is the can?  If it's a 3oz can, then two cans is fine.  If it's the 6oz size, then it *may* be too much.<br>  <br>  But there are a few factors to consider such as the brand you're using and how many calories it contains, the weight of your cat, and your cat's appetite.<br>  <br>  You may be able to find the food you're using in this list:   Values in canned foods:  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/canfood.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/jmpeerson/canfo...</a><br>  <br>  If you find it it'll tell you how many calories are in the food.  Then you can use this simple formula to determine how much your cat can eat per day.  Multiply your cat's ideal weight by its activity level to arrive at how many calories it can consume per day.  Your cat's ideal weight may or may not be its current weight.  The activity level number is between 20 and 30.  20 is for a couch potato or for weight loss and 30 is for cats who never stop moving.  25 is average.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that while it sounds like a lot of food, canned food is typically lower in calories than dry so cats can eat more of it.|`|YBcB0732aa	My cat eat wellness canned cat food.<br>  He eat 2 oz two times a day. A couple of day ago I gave my cat Fancy feast because I got it for free. He ate the whole can 3 oz and was still hungry. But with wellness he doesn't even finish all of his food.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Yes it is. moist foods also keeps cats hydrated. In the wild, cats get almost all of their water from the juices of their prey, with an occasional trip to some body of water.  Cats aren't used to drinking so much water, but they have too if fed dry food. Some cats don't get enough because it just doesn't feel right, and therefore don't get enough water. A diet of only dry food can lead to urinary infections in males, so it is especially important that your males get fed canned food or fresh raw meat a few days a week.<br>  <br>  I do not feed my cat canned food, I feed her kibble on some days and raw meat on others. it works for me.

I inherited it from my aunty.  Its black with a cats head drawn on in silver.  The outline is silver but the inside is just the black t-shirt.  Its beautiful.  I dont own any other cat stuff personally.  But my cats have cat trees, their own fridge, endless beds, toys and igloos,  scratching posts, scissords, collard leads and harnesses.  I am about to build a cat gym out of cardboard boxes, and houses out of broken computer monitors.  I am also training them to use the human toilet instead of a litter tray.  So I have an old toilet down stairs, and my toilet upstairs has a bowl in it filled with litter - which theyre using.  Eventually I'll replace the litter with water, and then remove the bowl altogether.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I have a cat tee shirt and sweatshirt that says "My cat walks all over me"  which is very true  the picture on that one looks a lot like one of my cats<br>  <br>  I have a sweatshirt that says "don't hate me because I'm beautiful"  that one has a picture of a cat that looks a lot like my other cat<br>  <br>  and I have a sweatshirt that says"Property of my cat"  which is true though it should have and "s" on cat.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I am pathetic.

After that time try and release it and if it is able to fly let it go.  If is is still not flying and seems disoriented you need to get the bird to a local wildlife rehab:<br>  <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact....</a><br>  Also, pay no attention to the person telling you if it is a baby the parents will reject it due to it being touched by human hands..this is an old wives tale and holds NO truth.|`|w1iHxDL1aa	Place the bird somewhere safe, check out what bird it is and provide what it needs, like food, water, shelter etc.|`|b23fc05784582219194e06e552f9bfb0aa	if its a chick, you'll have to let it go, if the adult smells the human smell on the bird it wont let it back in the nest. if its an adult you can try to nurse it back to health, but be careful! these things can carry diseases and will bite you! the best idea is to put it in a safe spot in a tree or a high spot so its safe and let it take care of its self. if there are no visible wounds than the dog probably didn't hurt it much. oh and by the way, when a dog brings you a bird (dead or alive) it is telling you that she wants a reward because she is giving it to you as a gift and to prove her hunting skills. same thing with a cat and a mouse, its all for you =)|`|G4jWrPRHaa	take it to the vet.|`|kHBCUxwHaa	let it go survival of the fittest|`|EUyUVJMxaa	heres what u do, u throw it on ur roof and forget about it

Sometimes putting up a bird feeder near the window is a great way to keep him busy watching the birds or squirrels.|`|b8VRlStoaa	Dogs are like children, they need attention and love to grow up healthy and happy. I understand having to work all day, but then you need to expect to have to put the time in when you are home, that's part of being a pet owner. The suggestion for a dog babysitter is a good one. Maybe you have family or someone who could spend a few hours a day with the dog while you are at work to not make the alone time such a long stretch. I understand the affordability problem of hiring a doggy sitter, but maybe a nephew/niece or someone who lives close that you could throw a few bucks too. Anyway, Dogs need your love and affection, not a distraction.|`|BevNefTHaa	well you should get a dog babysitter and when you get one tell her to not let him sleep a lot and to wake him up.

Look for signs he has to go, turning circles, sudden loss of interest in playing, going off on his own..pick the puppy up & take it outside & tell it to go pee (or poop). Also put the puppy outside about every 30mins at first & try it. When he does eliminate outside praise him like crazy using the words Good Pee/Poo. (very helpful for training to eliminate on command)  if there are accidents inside, use a stern NO & get puppy outside fast, do not let it finish inside. Blot inside pees with a paper towel & put the puppy AND the paper towel outside & then praise as if it was done outside. (same with poop, put the puppy and the poop outside) If you can't give the puppy all your attention to watch him, use a crate, the less accidents he makes inside, the faster he learns. Use a non ammonia spray to mask the smells where he does have accidents.|`|b8VRlStoaa	Take the puppy out often. Also use of puppy training pads has worked very well for us. They are a sheet you set on the floor where the puppy tries to pee. You gradually move the pads closer and closer to the exit door where you take the puppy out. This helps teach the puppy to go towards the door when they have to pee and gives you a visible sign when they need to go out. Also do not abuse the puppy for making a mistake, instead praise them heavily when they do good and remind them by placing them on the pad immediately after a mistake that that is where they are supposed to go. Most puppies potty train very easily if you put the time and encouragement in. Also you have to pay attention, they will give you a sign they have to go even before they are trained, usually something like sniffing the floor and walking in a circle. Puppies are our most faithful friends, love and enjoy him or her.|`|jCeylLsIaa	get a video that has it. i've seen a trainer video for dogs (ask your vet)...i already saw one. let the dog watch it.

If you discipline them they will just think going potty is bad, and they will hide from you next time they go. Also you only have about 2 seconds after they go until they forget and then if you discipline them they will think it's for something else. If they go in the house just clean it up and ignore them, make sure you use a good cleaner because if they can smell it they will go in that spot again. Bring them out after they eat or sleep and about once every hour. When they go outside give them a treat right away and give them tons of praise. I tied a bell to the door and everytime I open the door I use her paw to ring the bell then open the door. Bell training is great. If you see her circling like shes going to go make a loud noise (not in her face) it will distract her long enough to put her leash on and get her outside.|`|gkVd0encaa	i used to dip my dogs nose in the dodoo... lol then he eventually got the point! no dodoo in the house!!|`|4w0dQ1xwaa	training to puppy <br>  <br>  Go to morning walk with his puppy, he is like very well

NBfBKI1Uaa	When you do water changes in the saltwater tank, you simply cannot juts pour tap water into the tank like in freshwater aquarium.<br>  <br>  You must first mix the marine salt and make sure that the specific gravity is as close to tank's speecific gravity. <br>  <br>  I usually have a couple large bucket that I used for mixing the water. I would mix the salt, then place heater and powerhead (for better mixing) for a couple of hours. In this you don't even need dechlorinating chemicals. <br>  <br>  Then I take out 25% and not 30% to 50%. That is way too much unless you have very high nitrate level or during major maintenance. <br>  After taking out the water, I would simply pour the mixed water into the tank.<br>  <br>  Now if you are simply topping off the water that usually evaporate, you don't need to mix salt. Simply pour regular water. But in this case you only add about a couple of gallons a week or every few days. So matching the salinity isn't that important. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|H06PtiIAaa	i have 50 gallon plastic contaners and i always have tap water in it, so it dechlorinates and then i add the salt mix and a powerhead/ let it run for 48 hours add the buffer and you can use the heater and check the levels with the hydrometer.<br>  <br>  it is always better to have the saltwater mixed ahead of time so you dont mess it up.|`|Um8osMNuaa	A 50% water change is too much, stick to 30% at the most. l use RO water, mix in the salt, leave it in a bucket with an heater until it reaches the same temperature as the tank, then take the water out of the tank and replace it with the salt water from the bucket.<br>  lf you put the cold water straight into the tank you can stress the fish and kill them with the sudden change in the temperature.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	First, don't use tap water. Use  distilled or RO/DI water.<br>  I use a large lobster pot to mix the water in. Add the water to the pot, add salt and mix-then heat the pot on the stove until its about the right temp, and measure the specific gravity. match as reasonably close to your tank as possible. If you need to make more than 5 gallons of salt water, do it in batches.|`|RXYZb6bsaa	tap water is prolly not good enough for a reef tank maybe ok for fowlr
HsGhF9osaa	Have you seen 'The Dog Whisperer' on tv ? he's brilliant!! Your story is like the ones that he deals with----ok at first then goes all haywire. He says that dogs like to be in a pack & and in this pack there are followers & leaders. You have to show him your the leader or he tries to be one himself,even if he would like to be a follower. Give him 'boundaries & limitations' as ceasar says. He does this without a word.As soon as he looks like doing something that he doesnt agree with he touches him hard on the side of the neck & with a sharp sound,and the dog just understands.You have to show him your confident enough to take charge. Dont let him walk in front when out walking --leaders do that. Is he getting enough excercise. It could be too much nervous energy.  I hope I've helped & not confused you. Good luck.P.S. Rotties are ceasar's favourite!

Funny that yours does it too!|`|TwBgfWFraa	haha yes yes my cats bite their nails which is very odd. This usually happens if you do not cut the nails often enough and they grow out too long. Also, a cats nail sheds at times, so the kitty will bite off the part that is sheding.

Two sets of hands are best. Get 2 chairs and face each other. One holds the cats. Grab under chest and by scruff of neck. The other person GENTLY manipulates the digits of each paw and clips off the ends. Don't forget the dew claw. Be careful not to trim too close. You will be able to see a red vein in the claw. Do not trim into that. If you do, it will bleed. Put a little cornstarch on it to stop the bleeding.<br>  <br>  There is no need to trim the hind paws, only the front.<br>  <br>  Which reminds me, my ninja cat needs trimming.
9kceDOTraa	It's fairly clear that Dax has little to no experience with cichlid keeping or has no intelligence to understand them.<br>  <br>  Green Terrors are South Americans and both the male and female, which is very common that both parents watch over a spawning site.  You don't have to do anything really.  With Africans though you have to isolate the holding female if they are a mouthbrooder.  That's about the extent of parents eating their fry, just male African mouthbrooders is all.|`|M69z5oNQaa	Any chichlid will eat its fry.

fFtBqFB6aa	maybe try putting the kennel in your room, if it will fit. Maybe being next to you guys will calm her in the morning. Or, maybe she's just a morning dog. lol|`|9kTejB0uaa	Difficult one because on the one hand, you should not react, and tell her to settle down, but on the other she might be asking to go out and you need to encourage that.  Personally I'd have to give her the benefit of the doubt, let her out (or maybe even set your alarm for just before 6, so you get there before she starts up), let her out - go out with her.  Bring her back in after she's emptied, and put her back in her crate with a biscuit or two, tell her to settle down, and go back to sleep until you are ready to get up.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately with the nights getting shorter, she is going to react to the earlier light outside so this isn't going to get better - until you manage to train her that she doesn't move until you do!!  How old is she?  Obviously if she's still very young, you can't expect her to hold her pee, but if she's over say 14 weeks, you can aim to risk calling to her to settle down.  Is she warm enough in her room - something if they get chilly, this will make them restless.<br>  <br>  Good luck- it will get better!|`|b8VRlStoaa	If your dog is a year old and goes to the crate well at bed time, then 6-6:15 is when she needs to go out. you say half the time she doesn't potty , but that means half the time she does. She's being a good dog and going out like she's supposed to instead of pottying in the house. As she gets older she may sleep in a little more, but you have a part lab, they have energy. I think by quelling the barking you will be training her backwards, to not let you know when she needs something.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Try draping a heavy blanket over her crate to make it feel more like a den and to block out the morning light- if it's dark she may not wake up as early. Don't let her out when she is barking, she will learn very quickly that all she has to do to get out is to bark, wait until she stops barking before you release her,. Take her for a short walk around the block before bed so you are absolutley sure she has went to bed with an empty bladder (limit her water after 6pm) and can make it til 7 or 8am. Also try adding a toy or two in her crate that she doesn't have access to during the day, she may play with it in the morning unstead of barking.|`|FaPrr8bbaa	My neighbor starts his diesel pickup truck at 4:30 am and my little dogs would let me sleep until 5:00 am.

AA10859773	What Suzy said.<br>  <br>  However, there are pouch foods that may suit your cats.  Historically pouch foods were much like moist foods in quality or maybe were the same thing.  But these days there are at least two brands with a pouch line that are pretty decent.  Wellness and By Nature Organics.<br>  <br>  I think they're going to cost more than canned foods but the quality is pretty good.  And they are chunkier foods which your cats may prefer.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd give canned foods another try.  There are very few cats who can't be converted if you put enough effort into it and find that magic bribe that gets them to try it!<br>  <br>  So you've finally realized that dry food is not appropriate for cats and you want to get your kibble junky to eat canned food. Where do you start?<br>  <br>  1. Buy the best. See <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/commercialcannedfoods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/commercialcannedf...</a> for suggestions, and also see my blog on identifying good foods <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-ytgWjlI5er8IWP.paz_7JTvgf_5D?p=59.">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-ytgWjlI5e...</a> Although you don't want to feed fishy foods more than 2-3 times per week (<a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whyfishisd..." rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a> ), you might want to get a few. The stronger smell may be more appealing, and perhaps you could use it as a topping on other foods as well. <br>  <br>  2. Buy as many varieties as you can. Get different brands and different flavors. Also try different textures - some prefer mushy food, others prefer ones that are chunkier.  You just never know what's going to appeal to a cat.<br>  <br>  3. Offer a teaspoonful or so of the new food in a separate bowl at feeding time. Do this at every meal. The idea is that kitty will finally realize it's food and will give it a shot. By offering just a small amount, you'll avoid digestive upsets should he or she be willing to give it a try.<br>  <br>  4. If he tries any, note which brand/flavor it was. You may then want to focus on that brand or that flavor in other brands. But don't be fooled. The cat may eat it all up but then never want to eat it again. So before buying a case of a food that he seems to like, make sure he's going to continue going for it.<br>  <br>  5. You can try putting a smear of food on his nose or mouth. That'll cause him to lick it. If he likes it, he may try more.<br>  <br>  6. Bribes. Crush some kibble and sprinkle it over the top. Try fish or liver flakes, parmesan cheese, a drop of soy sauce, meaty baby food (with no added onion or garlic), whatever it takes.  CATNIP!  If your cat doesn't seem to go for any of these bribes, try dried catnip flakes.  Some have had success doing this.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  You can also try mixing dry and wet together, but if you do you should not leave the mixture down for longer than 1/2 hour or so.  The same is true if you're sprinkling the food with crushed kibble.  That's because when kibble gets wet it can turn into a bowl o' bacteria.  It's safe if eaten right away though.<br>  <br>  7. You can run the food (in a container of course) under hot or warm water or even nuke it for a few seconds to bring it to "mouse body temperature." This may also release the scent and that may draw the cat in.<br>  <br>  8. Don't try starving the cat into submission. That could ultimately be fatal. You may want to cut back a bit on the regular food so that hunger may encourage him to eat, but don't force the issue. As he starts eating more canned, you will decrease the amount of kibble he's getting. But just be sure that he gets enough to eat every day.<br>  <br>  Realize that you will waste food and money. Be patient and persistent. The results will be worth it!|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	moist cat food is horrible for your cat. Stop feeding the mainstream brands, feed a high quality natural canned food. it's a lot healthier.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Tender Vittles and its ilk was discontinued and taken off the market because of the ill effects on cats, particularly thyroid issues.  The high salt, fat, and wheat content needed to keep it "moist" was literally killing cats.  It also lost nutritional value and contaminated very quickly.  Your cats won't live well on treats either, and the more you continue to give them, the less they will want regular food,   dry or wet.  The FDA relented for the production of these type of kibbles as "treats" only.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, you won't be able to find it and I doubt the pet food companies are going to defy the FDA or want to face the massive law suits that came out of it by making it again.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	I'd give the food pouches a try also. Wellness and Nutro make them. I'd give can a try if that doesn't work. Don't go for the Science Diet, Iams, Eukanuba. There's not a lot of nutrion in it. <br>  <br>  Try Wellness, California Natural, Innova canned. There's plenty more of great foods out there. That's to just to name a few. Make sure that's there no corn, wheat and soy in there. No meat by-products. You're cat will be in beter health.|`|LURQBU86aa	Try getting a high quality cat food such as Wellness, Blue Buffalo, or Evo and add some water to it to moisten it. Tender vittles was indeed a very bad food and was discontinued for very good reasons! One of my cats has had alot of dental work done as well. All together I think he's had 12 teeth pulled, but he still eats the dry stuff without any problem.
FqxlY0yWaa	I would say either a border collie or a golden retriever i have a border collie and you couldnt act for more of a playfull smart and extremly nice dog they are great with everyone and is exacly what you are looking for!!!

And hes only 3 years old i still have a lot more to train him!! And they are great with other dogs including puppies!!!!!|`|X4umNoGzaa	Well I personally say a Pomeranian, they are adorable little balls of fluff, who love to play, but if your other dog is bigger, a pom might not be the best breed, because Pom's don't see themselves as little dogs, usually, so this could cause the Pom harm if playtime isn't monitored closely, but lab's are great dogs too, and love to play, they are very smart also.|`|4AmASNXUaa	I just got a bull mastiff.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  All of what you describe are reasons for you to take your cat to your vet to find out what is going on with him.<br>  <br>  His "habit" of urinating anywhere.. and in small amounts is symptomatic of a urinary tract infection, bladder blockage/ stones. He may also be in the early stages of kidney failure. You don't mention his age or if he is neutered.<br>  <br>  Here are  two excellent articles about these conditions for more detailed information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/a/flutd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/a/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/p/CRF.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/p/...</a><br>  <br>  These conditions can be quite painful for cats and I highly advise you to call your vet asap so that he/she can diagnose and treat your cat.  These conditions are serious and need immediate attention.<br>  <br>  Cats who are sick and in pain frequently stop grooming themselves. It is one of the most common "red flags" for cat owners to seek professional advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your kitty and I hope that he recovers quickly.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|Td8XL4Bwaa	take him to the vet insallah he will be alright!!|`|sBn7D0h4aa	It could possibly be the beginning signs of some sort of problem since male cats alot of times have urination problems since their urethra tube is so narrow. I'd say he does have classic signs though of a urinary tract infection which is easily treated if you can catch it early. We were putting a powder to help with the urinary tract infection on our male cats food which seemed to really help. We were also syringing a little bit of 100% cranberry juice into his mouth as well to help with it. (but make sure it's 100% juice) <br>  <br>  If it's not a urinary tract infection it could also could be where you have your littler box and how old he is. Sometimes older cats will not want to go down stairs to use a litterbox so it's best to put one where they have an easier time getting to it.<br>  <br>  Also if there are certain spots your cat always is wanting to urinate we found that soaking cotton balls in mouthwash and setting them in the area they always want to pee on will deter them from urinating there since cats hate the smell of it.|`|szzoxJRBaa	my cat did the same thing a couple of years ago. if the urine spots are kind of small, and hes tending to urinate on things that are soft, its probably a urinary tract infection.  my cat did the same thing, stopped grooming, and kept eating. i took him to the vet, and they diagnosed him with the urinary infection, they gave him meds and we had to change his food.|`|MHujoCWMaa	These are classic signs of an urinary infection.  Male cats are more susceptible to them.  Please take your cat to the vet to be treated.  It can be very serious.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	Urinary Tract Infection...Get your cat to the vet. It could die.

You need to check in with your vet.
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Yes an old dog can learn new tricks.  The problem is people seem incapable of learning how to treat dogs. <br>  Clever people outsmart their dogs with training.  <br>  Only an idiot would hit a dog because idiots don't learn, they already think they know it all.|`|AA12128656	you CAN teach an old dog new tricks.<br>  <br>  but if you beat it, i hope it bites you.<br>  <br>  you should change your screen name to basement cat.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Yes, you can.

iEGBunTIaa	I used to leave the TV on for my budgie a few years ago. It helped him not to screech when left alone. He was a rescue and had some issues with being left alone.<br>  I leave the TV on for my African Grey parrot when I leave the house. He picks up some really interesting sounds from the cartoon channel, his favorite. He also enjoys watching the animations. He actually laughs at the TV when I am out of the room. He really has learned to laugh like a human at the most appropriate times. Did I mention he is an African Grey? Very intelligent.<br>  <br>  It doesn't need to be very loud, either. That way he can sleep if he so desires.|`|Um8osMNuaa	l leave the TV on for my parrot, it keeps him company when l'm busy doing other things.

ZmZEhBOoaa	They'll be okay. In fact, you don't even need to have someone come around to feed the fish. As cruel as it may sound a tank of community tropicals will be fine starving for a week. It may even do them some good.<br>  <br>  But if you do have someone come around it may be worth them powdering half a flake for the fry - they don't need much food at all (though it may seem a lot relative to their size). I take it your "breeding net" has a drop-out, fine mesh section for the babies to escape into.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	It's just a fish. If they die, she will get pregnant again and have more. It's just a fish.|`|tShDXmgbaa	If you leave mom in breeder net with fry...I can assure you she will eat everyone of them in no time.

32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	First you must ask yourself what you want in a pet and in a pet cockatiel?  <br>  <br>  Tiels are not cuddly.  They are affectionate in that they like being around people.  Most tiels don't like being touched, petted. Most tiels don't tolerate someone petting their backs or wings and move away or fly away. Some like a nice little head scratch.  <br>  <br>  They are dusty birds and you will find this out fast and you will be doing alot of dusting.  Their dander which makes them so soft and helps keep them warm and clean and water resistant goes everywhere and it can damage electronics by clogging air vents and such.<br>  <br>  They are not really noisy but some males can be loud and excessive in their 'fwep' 'fwep' sounds to get out of the cage or get your attention.  Females are quieter.<br>  <br>  Diet must be many things such as seed mix, pellets, vegetables, fruits, breads, eggs, yogurt and more.  It's not just a bag of seed mix and water.  <br>  <br>  Cages must be kept clean and all birds are messy.  There will be seed and feathers and tiel dander around the cage all the time.  It's a never ending battle.<br>  <br>  Birds like cockatiels can be good pets if you know what you are getting into and can handle it for at least a decade or more.<br>  <br>  There is also vet care if the tiel gets sick or injured.  This isn't cheap.  The same as if you take a dog to the vets.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	depends on the type of bird.<br>  I love parrots and cocktails or love birds.|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Ummm well I "read the final" what whatever his name was and that's not ture in all cases. It all depends on how you train your cockatiel and their personality. They don't cuddle on their backs but mine loves to be touched and rubbed....even on the back and wings. He is loud when he wants attention but other than that his songs are not loud. <br>  <br>  They are good pets, they will love you, sing, and talk to you(males if you work hard) Mine loves to take showers with me, and see to what's going on when I clean and am on the computer. Haha sometimes if i forget to bring him with me he will fly to me and give me this look like "why did you leave me!?" Anyways! here is a site for more info on cockatiels and parrots in general. Hope this helps a little. <a href="http://parrotcentral.net/cockatiels.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/cockatiels.htm</a><br>  p.s. a good book to look into is  "Cockatiels for Dummies"|`|CvbB4qv3aa	If you want a bird, yes.<br>  I used to have one, although he was very anti social most birds are.<br>  <br>  He loved to fly into the window though.|`|yye8RYeUaa	Yes they are. Mine sings all the time, always seems to be happy.
8c4f5448125b34e2bc59c2ba87385a71aa	My cat doen't meow to wake us up but she comes in and jumps on our chest and kneads us, walks all over us, chirps at us. We used to drug her up with catnip, let you out, give her treats to appease her. But she got more needy and would keep on pouncing on us. So we started closing our door. <br>  You may want to designate a room for her, or shut yours and everyone's door to keep her out. I felt bad at first and you may too. But i'm sure you have toys she can play with, food and water. Cats are just ready for you to get up when they are up. So just shut your door, your cat will play with a toy, or like mine, find it's favorite spot and do what cat's do best...sleep.|`|qc9iax2maa	Next time you catch her doing that, spray her with a spray bottle. She'll learn eventually. Maybe she just wants food. I suggest you give her a bit of hard food before you go to bed, so that's not the case anymore.<br>  But I assure you, spray bottles work! Cats hate water!|`|wseijU8taa	well if you cat doing this to wake you and your family up then ignor it.|`|4Cxys1P7aa	put it out side.|`|63ff74d8b74029f44c5d4403dc78e14aaa	Grab it by the tail and sling it against the wall.

BWez86Ldaa	My goodness you got some silly answers on this one, and I doubt they were very helpful, so let's try a serious answer, eh? Rats like small, comforting spaces, and seeing as how most people don't wear extremely loose shirts, I'll assume that you wear tight or semi-tight shirts that provide close comfort for your little one. <br>  <br>  Rats are easily trained, so I suggest you train him to stop doing this. How? Well, every time he goes down your blouse, pull him out and say, "no". Do this until he becomes uninterested in the inside of your shirt. If this doesn't work (it would take quite a while, at least an hour, I'd say, of continuous work), I suggest incorporating treats. When you get him out and put him on your shoulder, give him a Yogie (or whatever treats you use), if he goes down your blouse again, put him on your shoulder again, wait a minute then give him another Yogie (treat). Training is very easy and basic, but it can take a while for them to completely catch on.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Cza93x9daa	My rats like to do that too, and I know how annoying it is when you have tiny little scratches all over you. I've been there! <br>  What I like to do is hold some sort of old bit of soft material over my arms, and then they more comfortable and secure, and they also play in it, while I sit down and watch tv with them next to me. <br>  <br>  I don't think there is any way of actually 'training' them to stop doing that, but perhaps having something that they can 'hide in' (like an old towel) rather than your shirt with you might help.<br>  <br>  For those of you saying thats 'discusting' and 'rats don't belong on shoulders', you wouldn't know because you obviously don't have rats.|`|jpS9wgu8aa	rats love the warmth and padding girls breast provide, so to stop your rat form doing that, reward it for staying on your shoulder and other acceptable parts of you body. but the moment it goes down your shirt remove it and don't feed it treats. rats are smart and easily bribed by food.|`|SFghfymgaa	It's okay I have a rat too that goes down my shirt and keeps warm.

veDvtYhJaa	1 rule should be NO DOGS on furniture.  That solves the problem immediately.  <br>  <br>  If you have a leather chair or couch, dog's really should NOT be allowed on it.  It will deteriorate as a result of the body oils from the dog and it's fur.  It's not good for the leather.  It's a lot more cleaning work for you.  It's a bad habit for the dog.<br>  <br>  #2 - if you can't handle #1 rule should be NO DOGS allowed in the same room as leather furniture until it's fully dry after cleaning.  Cleaning something and then allowing a dog on it before it's dry is just plain foolish.<br>  <br>  Once the leather is dry, the dog can NOT get it on his pads unless his pads are all wet.  There won't be a residual odor that would make him lick the leather either.  If you are so paranoid as to not believe these facts, then I can't help you.<br>  <br>  I have large breed dogs and they are very happy on the floor.  I'm pack leader.  Places I sleep or sit (my bed and my chairs and couches) are privileged and ONLY pack leader is allowed on them.

65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Although this is an old-time remedy, it really doesn't work.<br>  There is controversy about the safety of garlic--garlic is related to onions.  Onions have a compound that causes hemolytic anemia (the compound damages red blood cells; those damaged cells are naturally removed from circulation, thus causing anemia).  Garlic has this same compound, although in a much lower amount.  Cats are MUCH more susceptible to heinz body formation on their RBC's.<br>  <br>  So please, play it safe and avoid garlic altogether, especially in a cat.  I recommend a product such as Frontline Plus or Revolution (available from your vet) for flea treatment/prevention for both your cat and dog.  If you have financial constraints, BioSpot is a good product as well, and similar to Frontline Plus.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Yes, natural antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal & expectorant.

While garlic is touted to be a natural flea remedy in dogs, natural does not necessarily mean safe.  The best, safest, and most effective flea medications for cats and dogs are those that are sold by your vet for that very purpose.  And also keep in mind that cats metabolize things much differently than dogs (and humans) do - something that is perfectly safe for your dog may be harmful or lethal to your cat.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Garlic is toxic to cats and dogs.

veDvtYhJaa	Actually, you aren't ready for the responsibility of having either a dog OR a child.  <br>  <br>  You really do need to rehome the dog because neither you nor your husband act in a responsible manner.  You should NOT just buy a dog and it's magically perfect in how it acts.  You should NOT buy a high energy dog and not exercise it so it gets bored and ruins things.  You should NOT buy a pitt bull and not bother to take it to obedience classes and not learn how to train it, and learn how to be a good strong alpha pack leader.  <br>  <br>  If your husband isn't willing to watch and guide the dog and prevent these mishaps, it's wrong for him to let the dog run loose in the house. Getting "onto her" AFTER she's done something wrong is pointless.  If he didn't SEE her do it and scold her INSTANTLY as he stopped her bad actions, then she has NO IDEA what he was scolding her for.  <br>  <br>  You're a human being.  She's a dog.  She doesn't follow human logic and think "gee, these are my chew toys... "  she thinks... gee, that phone thingie looks interesting, I wonder how it tastes!  <br>  <br>  Neither of you has taken responsibility to watch the dog, to train the dog, to exercise this high energy dog.  You have no right to keep the dog.  You aren't ready for a dog ... and raising a puppy is like raising a child, so you're not ready for that either... children also take patience, training and TIME!  your time... if you don't give the dog or child your time, then you end up with one that misbehaves!  That's the bottom line.  You BOTH have created a monster and you don't have the patience or willingness to do what it takes to correct YOUR mistaken behavior, so you should rehome the dog. <br>  <br>  Pitt Bulls can be wonderful.  A pitt bull that's not trained or disciplined properly (instantly upon infraction) becomes the kind of dog that gives pitt bulls their BAD reputation.  <br>  <br>  BTW:  Puppies are teething from about 3 mo to 5 or 6 mo, so your pup may well be teething.  She needs someone who will train her lovingly, accept that she's a pup and makes puppy mistakes, give her lots of running and playing exercise, and read up on the breed to know how to raise her to be a good adult dog. If you're not up to the task, find her someone who is.  There are people out there who'd LOVE to have her. -!-|`|Chxoncy7aa	You can not expect a 13 week old puppy to not chew, that's what they do.

It would be cheaper in the long run to purchase a crate, sometimes you can even find used one in the paper <br>  You needed to start training the puppy as soon as he walked in the door. Crate train him, make sure you are giving him lots of walks and you need to play with him not just make the toys available.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	puppys chew and will amuse themselves if someones not paying attention.<br>  i have 6 dogs in my house. the 3 youngest, a young pit mix, 8 mth lab mix and a 2 yr old <<< terrier/doxie mix. even if i just go to the bathroom, they all go in their crates.<br>  it's for their safety as well as the safety of my house.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	All of this could be avoided by giving proper excercise and training to your dog.

She is awfully cute, I love her picture!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	sounds to me like you need to train your husband : )  i have the same problem with mine, he's never really had dogs before and doesnt understand that a good dog takes a lot of training, patience, and CONSISTENCY. we had a rottie (2 years old) who was just nuts (we didnt get him as a pup). he would jump all over you, pee on the bed, tear things up, etc. i constantly worked with him but my fiance let him do whatever he wanted. the dog was obsessive about getting attention and would push our other dogs out of the way to get to us, he would leap onto the couch into our lap, and went absolutely nuts if i sat on the floor for any reason. because i'm pregnant and on bed rest, i could no longer continue training him and my fiance did nothing to remedy his issues. i did end up getting rid of the dog for the safety of our baby. <br>  could he have been trained? yes. were his issues worth giving him up for? no. with training would the dog have been fine with the baby? yes. was my fiance trainable? no. so the dog had to go. i refuse to have a dog around who could accidentally kill my child because my fiance doesnt understand the work involved in owning a dog. <br>  it sounds to me like you are having a similar issue. what i would do, is tell your husband that either he steps up his responsibility or you are going to get rid of the dog, then if he doesnt, follow through with the threat. bad behavior only gets worse if not addressed early. explain that to him and see what he says.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Did you even bother to research dogs BEFORE getting one?  Puppies chew, they need supervision they need training, the one you should be getting rid of is your husband not the dog.<br>  <br>  This makes me so mad when people get dogs then want to give them up because they destroyed something in the house.  I'm sorry lady but IT'S YOUR FAULT that the dog did this, NOT the dogs.  No supervision from you or your husband, left to her own devices, no exercise, no training, no rules and boundaries taught and you wonder why the dog is doing all this stuff?  My dog chewed bed frames, she ate baseboards, she ate a door frame, she ripped the skirt off of my brand new sofa that I'd had only a month.  Did I get rid of her NO, I crate trained her, I put her in the garage while at work, I exercised her daily, I put her in day care several days a week so she wouldn't be bored at home, but never at one time did I ever consider getting rid of her.  Even well trained dogs slip every once in a while, mine got into a bag of garbage and ripped it open ALL OVER THE HOUSE, yes I was mad, yes I yelled but did I consider getting rid of them...well I did entertain the idea for 5 minutes while yelling but no, it happens, objects are replaceable, garbage is easily cleaned up, poop and vomit are also easily cleaned, when you get a dog this is what you sign up for.<br>  <br>  I laugh now but it's MY fault they got into this bag, why, because I left it sitting out and they are DOGS.<br>  <br>  Objects are replaceable, as for your phone, get a prepaid phone, if you had insurance on your phone you'd be able to get a replacement, also there's no reason why you cannot purchase a phone online on Ebay and then get your number transferred to it by going online, it's done all the time you don't have to wait until your 2 year contract is up, also if it's up in April, guess what??? you are now eligable to get a new phone BEFORE the contract is finished.  I should know I work for a cell phone company also Verizon allows you to upgrade 4 months before your contract expires so that's not an excuse.<br>  <br>  You need to train your husband AND the dog.   Bills, money, working and stress are NOT legitimate reasons for rehoming a dog, EVERYONE has those problems and we all do perfectly fine with our dogs.<br>  <br>  There is not one person on here that hasn't been thru the same situation as you when our dogs were puppies infact for the first 3 years of their lives, you make a commitment to an animal a 13 year commitment and you honor it by not giving up the moment things get tough.  This is what animals do, if you can't handle it get a goldfish.|`|Gfwt9XPJaa	a dog needs trainig soshouting at her won't do it. yoiu should'nt have got a dog if you wern't prepared to look after it. they are a bigcommitment and u obviously weren't ready for it. think u stupid woman.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Rehome the dog while you can.<br>  You will never form a bond with this dog.

Sorry to be harsh but if the dog was never left unsupervised than nothing would be ruined.  She is a puppy and puppies chew!!  Crate training is invaluable tool.  Also you can tether her to you with a leash to keep her within distance.  And last, if you cannot trust hubby to watch her than don't let him!  If your eyes are not on her than assume she is getting in trouble.  It gets better as they get older IF you are CONSISTANT.  You wanted the dog, they don't come already trained and perfect, that is YOUR job.  Obedience classes would do both you and her wonders.....|`|GVXAqEm4aa	For the first several weeks of owning a new puppy you have to be prepared to watch them at all times to make sure they do not chew or potty in the house. For potty training put down food and water 3 times a day for a limited amount of time. Once they are done eating and drinking take it up until the next feeding. Puppies bladders are not fully formed at this age and they need to go out often. Even if they potty in the house take them outside and repeat one solid word, like "potty", or "go", and when they finally go reward them with lots of affection. I would also suggest getting a crate if you don't already have one. A pup needs to feel like they have a safe place and dogs are den animals. She is probably a bit anxious having been removed from her litter mates. Lastly, walk her as often as possible. Try to keep in front of her so she knows you are the pack leader. Lots of exercise will help with the boredom of chewing. She is also teething right now and will continue until about 8 months. Kongs are great for this and water bones you put in the freezer will help her with the pain. I hope this helps.|`|NBeQyTlMaa	Was getting the dog a joint decision? This makes it sound like the dog was your husbands idea and he isn't taking care of her. <br>  <br>  Somethings you are doing wrong all ready is letting the dog out of your site. Puppies should be in your site at ALL times, and if you can't watch her, then she should be in a kennel. This may sound mean, but what if your phone would have been charging and she chewed up the plugged in charger and got electrocuted? <br>  <br>  It's not her fault that she chews things up... She's a puppy. It's your fault for not watching her and teaching her what she should and shouldn't do. <br>  <br>  Most dogs are highly intelligent and when you catch her chewing on something she isn't supposed to, make an undesirable sound like a loud clap, tell her NO, and then give her one of her chew toys. In not long at all, she will learn what she can chew on as opposed to what she can't.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and a kennel should NEVER be used for punishment. The puppy should only relate the kennel to positive things... playing, getting a special toy for being in it, your praise when she goes in there. If you use it for punishment she will resent the kennel and will not ever want to go in it.|`|R6ZJL7bQaa	Wow I would be overly stressed upset and feel like that your husband wasn't on your side with this. I would consider training and if that doesn't work try playing with your dog more or getting it outside more often and praise him/her when ever it does what you wanna do.

Then every time we punish her she still wags her tail. But what we have started to do is every time she does something wrong we say a firm no! and put her into the kennel. She has gotten to the point that if she knows she did something wrong and we walk into the room she will put herself into the kennel.<br>  <br>  Puppies are a lot of work and you have to keep constant attention on them, you might want to think about getting a caged in area where she can run around the house or whatever, like a play pin. And working with her on that and eventually letting her throughout the room.<br>  <br>  You also might want to think about giving her up if you cannot control her behavior.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Good thing is she will grow out of it i trained mine to go to its hole when its acting up hole is behind the couch and yes hubby needs to take a stonger role in messing with her or you do till they over a year old that chewing stage is going to be there.if u decide to get rid of the dog dont take it to the pound they will kill it give it to me or some other bull-dog lover who give it a good home|`|d75418af0afbabc8b04b0f79a9839f30aa	I have a 16 week old Great Dane Puppy who, like yours, thinks that everything in the house is her toy. Like now for instance, she is chewing on a hamster wheel. In the past i have found the easiest way to correct this situation is to create a "room" for her or even just a large kennel, where she stays when she is not being watched. When she is out of her room, always have a toy or two handy and you absolutely have to watch her at all times. If she picks up something that is not her toy, take it away, firmly tell her that it's not hers, and then give her the toy and nicely tell her that it's her toy. It is best to remove as much important or valuable stuff to a higher surface until she learns. if she is out loose and she picks up one of her toys instead of something of yours, praise her, and play with her a little so she knows that playing with her toys is a good thing. As far as using the bathroom in the house, if you can keep her in an area near the door, when she starts sniffing around, or even if she starts peeing, don't yell at her, approach her, put on her leash and take her out immediately. if you walk in and she is peeing a gentle scolding is usually enough so she starts to realize that she's supposed to go out. when she pees or poops outside, get extremely excited adn tell her how good she is for going outside, so it makes it more enjoyable for her. When you find something that she has already chewed, more than 5 minutes after she chews it, punishing her is not effective because she won't understand. If your husband is not doing his part by watching her, keep her in her "room" until you are available to watch her, and if you're doing something that you are home but unable to see her all the time, keep her on her leash so you have her with you and she won't run off to another room and eat your favorite pair of shoes. This stage takes a lot of patience, and a lot of tolerance, and you have to remember, she's just a baby and she doesn't know better yet.|`|dFhEU8Y1aa	If you cannot accept the responsibility required to look after/train a puppy - you should certainly give her/him to a kennel that can find a loving owner who can give her the life she deserves.<br>  Where you unaware of the effort and patience required to train a puppy?  <br>  This is a prime example of why people should research and prepare before getting a puppy/dog/any animal.<br>  Puppies need constant attention - and training.  It can take months for dogs to be trained - and even then they can slip up every now and then.<br>  <br>  If you choose to keep the dog spend the money you are wasting on replacing stuff with dog training lessons - the quicker you get your dog trained the less likely it will be to cause you stress/time/money.<br>  <br>  People need to realise that pets are a lot of hard work - especially baby animals or untrained animals.<br>  <br>  She is a puppy - all that you have mentioned above is typical things puppies will do.  This is in NO way her fault - it is entirely yours and your husbands.  I'm sorry if this sounds harsh but it is the truth.|`|nTf6tOlDaa	Very stressing, I too have a puppy who likes to chew thankfully I found my phone before he could do more than put some bite marks on it.  <br>  <br>  First you need to have a talk with your husband, tell him you are overstressed and find a way to relax.  Next is find a room in your house that can be the 'puppys' room.  The kitchen usually works well.  ALWAYS keep the dog in there as well as her crate when unsuppervised.  Of course keep things off the floor and out of her reach.  <br>  <br>  I suggest spraying cables and furniture with no-chew spray either bought or made at home and applying as often as needed.  This stuff works wonders!<br>  <br>  Next reward her everytime you catch her chewing one of her toys, play with her for a bit everyday with 'her' stuff.  Keep spray bottles on hand to spray her with water when she is chewing something else or something that makes a loud harsh noise.   Growl at her and possibly roll her on her back in the submisive posture.  Keep her there for a few seconds and then stick her back in 'her room'.<br>  <br>  Rotate the toys she has available through out the week because dogs get bored just like kids.  Always keep one type of chew bone, the best kinds are textured, as well as a couple other interesting toys available. Those toys that you can put food in worked well with one of my dogs but not with the other.<br>  <br>  It takes a long time for dogs to grow up, I'd say two years.  Just keep training her and working with her and she will turn out to be a wonderful dog but ignore her or only punish her and she will not be a great dog.|`|o4NarYVoaa	You guys are obviously not ready for a puppy. But getting rid of her now is the cowards way out.  You need to do some serious research into Crate Training.  <br>  <br>  Dont punish the puppy because you guys dont know what to do with her, she is a baby and doesnt know better.  If you had a child, who didnt immediatly take to potty training when she was 12 weeks old would you give it back to the hospital?
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	In my experience, dogs who go nuts with spinning around need a lot more exercise.  They do it to release energy and out of control excitement.  Like you said, completely hyper. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would try to distract Harvey and put a stop to the spinning.  Spinning dogs can get right out of control mentally.<br>  Take him out often for long, energetic walks and/or runs and train him.  Obedience training tires a dog out mentally.<br>  <br>  It should go well with the JRT, they are smart little dogs who can give as much as they get.|`|9kTejB0uaa	My first tip would be to get a crate for the puppy.  Introducing a puppy into a household where there already is a dog takes time and care.  Both need a time-out place, their own space.  Adult dogs will not normally attack a puppy, but this can lead to frustration on the part of the older dog who needs to defend himself (those sharp teeth hurt!) without actually hurting the puppy in the process.  By all means let them get to know each other, and play, but don't leave them alone together to begin with, and be prepared to call a halt to things if it gets too manic.  There will be a huge difference in size at this point too and this needs careful handling, especially if your Lab is prone to 'mad moments'.<br>  <br>  Obviously if your Lab is entire, and the puppy will be a female, you have neutering to consider.  Now would be a good time to castrate your male, if he's not already done, and you should consider spaying the puppy at around 6 months (if this is to be a female), before her first season.  If the puppy is going to be a male, hold off castration until he's over a year, to allow time for him to grow and mature.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	we have a 3 yr old jack and a 10 month old labby our jack (sam) was 2 1/2 when we got labby(buster) and sam was not too happy about it at first he would snarl and growl at him but we kept telling him no and making sure he got the same attention as before.now they are best of friends.they are both scatty and buster is mad but we let them run in the garden and they play together gr8.good luck.
Gh2jzOHYaa	Puppy Mills are the worst things you could imagine. It is a large operation where they breed lots and lots of dogs as cheaply as possible, then they sell their puppies for a really high price, either over the internet, or they sell them to pet store. They keep their dogs in tiny cages through their entire lives. The dogs don't ever see a vet. They don't get any human interaction other than a bowl of food thrown at them every once in a while. They are usually matted and covered in urine burns. They breed their dogs during every heat cycle to produce as many puppies as possible. Puppy mills aren't usually run out of a person's home because they need a large area that is hidden from the public. Though if someone had a large piece of land hidden from common traffic, they might be running a puppy mill out of their home. Here is a video for you to watch about puppy mills:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HM8UmHM8Uo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HM8UmHM8...</a>|`|sUXyRlVjaa	<a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/puppymil.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/puppymil.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.turner.com/planet/promotions/puppies/prisoners.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.turner.com/planet/promotions/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.columbusdogconnection.com/PuppyMillArticles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.columbusdogconnection.com/Pup...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_mill" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppy_mill</a><br>  <a href="http://www.puppymills.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.puppymills.com/</a><br>  <br>  The above should give you a pretty good overview of puppy mills and what they are about.  As with any enterprise some are much worse than others.  Basically a puppy mill is any commercial dog breeding establishment that breeds dogs for profit.  At the best the dogs are at least housed in decent clean kennels, fed good (but not top) quality food and humanely killed when no longer producing.  At the worst, none of that occurs and dogs live in their own filth, b*tches are bred every heat from the time of their first heat, and are condemned to a life in H*ll.<br>  <br>  Even the "best" of the lot do not socialize or have any health checks done because that would reduce profit.  The pups are weaned and taken from their mothers too early because they have to get to the pet store by 8 weeks of age to be sold.  And they are often transported under questionable to horrendous conditions with many dying before they ever get to the pet store.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	it's terrible =[<br>  <br>  It's where dogs are bred and the puppies are sold to pet stores for money.<br>  <br>  The dogs they breed are usually in terrible condition and not taken care of...there only purpose it to have puppies. Once the dog is not longer able to have puppies, they are killed.|`|VaYjl71Laa	Take all the byb questions here about breeding.  Then just multiply it by well a lot.  They are byb's at a professional level who are efficient at breeding mutts, genetically unsound and questionable purebreds at best.|`|oi66N5QYaa	Puppy mills are exactly what they sound like....factories.  They are farms where dogs are mass-produced for the retail market.  The scumbags who operate them then sell their 'product' to distributors who sell them to pet stores.  They are perceived as nothing more than apples or corn or any other commodity.<br>  Only guess what, they are living things that need care and love.  These mills should be outlawed. And so should pet stores who buy dogs and cats from these places.  Small breeders are the best place to buy an animal. Better yet, the homeless dog population is so high in this country, that you should go to a pound or shelter to get your pet.|`|107edac54d5036be2b7be8f24972702faa	They are breeders who breed dogs, mostly for petshops, and have huge numbers of dogs (for breeding) kept in sad condition in overcrowded kennels or cages.. They don't care about breeding to better the breed.. they do it strictly for the money. The dogs and pups are usually in very poor health, and the pups often have many health issues. This is why people are always told to seek out reputable breeders and not go to petshops.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Below are three links that will explain it better than I could.  Basically, it's a place where money hungry individuals breed dogs as fast as possible, in some of the most cruel situations you could imagine.  Take a close look at the pictures and you will know where the majority of the puppies have come from that you see in most pet stores.  Too many people who don't know any better, pay very high dollar for these dogs, not realizing how likely it is they are getting a dog that is unhealthy, genetically and otherwise, due to the horrible conditions.  If you are in the market for a dog, I hope this will help you decide to adopt a homeless dog, or at least, to make sure you are dealing with a reputable breeder and not helping support this kind of situation.  You should also know dogs are not the only victims of this kind of mass producing.  Almost any pet for which folks will pay good money is at risk.  This is especially true of parrots.  The lesson is to just never purchase any kind of pet from a pet store.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://stoppuppymills.org/" rel="nofollow">http://stoppuppymills.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://stoppuppymills.org/inside_a_puppy_mill.html" rel="nofollow">http://stoppuppymills.org/inside_a_puppy...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/get_the_facts_on_puppy_mills/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affectin...</a>|`|XxSj6AsBaa	Dogs are bred for sale.

360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	No, the odor itself, while unpleasant, isn't harmful.<br>  <br>  Urine does contain ammonia, but as a gas, ammonia is lighter than air, so it won't pool indoors like other dangerous gases, such as propane. While it has a very pungent, distinctive odor, it's clear and difficult to combust unless highly concentrated. The smell does make some people light-headed, but this is usually fixed by leaving the area and/or airing out the room. It's more corrosive than anything (one of the reasons it's such a good cleaning agent), so just make sure it gets cleaned up quickly.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	no pet rat odor is not harmful i have 2 rats that r 3 feet long and stand about 2 feet high the smell is fine if u wanna get rid of it put a lil bit of water in a bigger bowl just to cover the bottom of it and let the rat run around in it dont fill it to much he could drown but after he runs around in it he will dry himself and the smell should be gone for a lil while|`|9BrcSWIkaa	Yeah I don't believe it is harmful, but it sure can stink. I have cleaned out a few houses of rat odor and it wasn't pretty. They had an infestation of rats and the whole attic was just soaked with urine and turds!

be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Yes, they are rare. Rare does not mean valuable, though. This coloring is considered a disqualification for the breed and is not supposed to happen. Basically, it's a genetic mistake.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	UM not true. Its a major disqualifying fault and no breeder intentionally breeds then because they are genetically unstable. What you have is a genetic mistake, a washed out dog. Get ready for tons of health problems that these types of dogs carry.|`|0lcSi5tnaa	Large percentage of white with brown markings are not rare but is out of the norm as reputable breeders dint keep mostly/all white boxers as they are kow to have more health problems!|`|GSf09ALBaa	No, not rare.

White Boxers happen all the time and the color is associated with many congenital defects so a lot of whites were culled in past times. If you have a white boxer, the first thing you need to do is spay or neuter, have eyes checked by a certified canine opthalmologist, have a BAER hearing test done and have a canine cardiologist do a cardio test. Plus you need to be on the lookout for problems with the dogs skin. All these things are associated with LACK of pigment, ie, white.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	A lady i know who use to breed boxers told me an all white boxer was very rare and many people were after them, in one of her many litters she did have an all white boxer and sold it to someone in California for over a grand, she said a lot of people were interested in buying it but the guy from CA offered the most money for it so he got it.<br>   But i'm not so sure about a white one with spots?|`|FoeyqAZqaa	Not at all.

kvHqnR5Haa	I have always thought that having 2 dogs is better than 1, but that was when they lived with my parents :)  I bought my first home a few months ago (prior to that I rented for 12 years) - which meant I  could finally have my own dog.  I got Stewie in January.  He spends his days with my mom and her two dogs (they are best buds!).  I keep thinking I want to get another one, but I kind of like just having the one since I work all day.  He gets tons of socialization with the other dogs during the day, but at night he is all mine :)  I know eventually I will probably get another one, but right now I really enjoy having just one to focus on, since he is my little squirt!|`|Q7uzVqGtaa	I had one dog and then my boyfriend surprised me with another one a year later and my first dog acts sooo much better than before we got the other one.  it took them about 2 weeks to warm up to each other all the way but now they are inseparable and they just play and sleep, to me its better for us and the dogs|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i personally think it's better to have two. they dont depend on you for as much. ex; if you have two they play more when you arent home and arent as hyper when you are there. they provide each other company. it helps with socialization.|`|tFKQYT6Naa	i think it is better to have 2 dogs instead of one because its better for the other dog so its not lonely whenever your not around..|`|mOtTr29aaa	yes it is good for you to have two and the other wont get lonley but think of the other dog its like you getting a brother or sister and your parents spending more time with them if your getting another make sure you spread the time equally between them|`|5nTMliTJaa	I have two... <br>  I always have had two..<br>  I always get one huge dog and one little dog that get along.

They both enjoyed each others company but Mitch had to be put down last April and that had a massive effect on Zoe (and of course me) she seemed down and wasn't very active so 5 months ago we bought a puppy and they get on like a house on fire and Zoe is back to her old self!
IFEIP5Doaa	really other things need to be looked at, what are the temps, what UVB bulb areyou using, what is the distance between the basking area and the UVB bulb? Humidity level? Are there cats/dogs in the house?<br>  <br>  Most WD's are wild caught, I can guarentee it if you got it from the pet store and it was $30 or less it was more than likely wild caught. I would 1, put newspaper around the tank, WD's dont understand the concept of glass well and are known to get mouth rot because of them rubbing their noses on it. And if you have a cat or dog, this will end the stress of them poking their little noses in to see it.<br>  <br>  Also the temps, are you reading it with a digital or stick on thermometer? Stick on thermometers can be incorrectl nywhere from 7-21 degrees, and thy read the temp of the glass, not of the ambint air, a digital will give you the correct temp, which you will want the basking area to be around 88-90 degrees.<br>  <br>  There is a differene between heat and UVB, if you bough a heat bulb, youdidnt buy a UVB bulb. So make sure you have one, I would suggest a repti-glo 8.0 or 10.0 , or a sunglo 8.0 or 10.0. for the 8.0's the distance from the bulb to the basking area should be 8-10", for the 10.0's 10-12". this bulbwill need to be replaced once every 6 months reguardless if it is burnt out or not.<br>  <br>  Humidity, are you misting your WD, be sure to mist at least twice a day, more if you live in a dry area. Here in ohio I mist twice a day to keep a humidity of around 70-80%. Durring the low peaks it falls to 40-50%, which is normal but not the humidity level you want to maintain at. <br>  <br>  Also substrate, keep your little WD on carpet, newspaper, paper towels as particle substrates can cause an impaction. <br>  <br>  Lastly food. i would ditch the mealworms, not only are they not ery nutrional, they are hcih in chiton which is a hard to digest protien which is prone to cause imactions. With with cricks or small silkworms for now. And offer alot! These guys need to eat alot, 8-12 crickets a day isnt enough, boost to 30+ crickets a day, the more the better, so if you can get your little one to eat 50, thats a good number. And this is over the course of 2-3 feedings a day, not all 50 at once. And whatever your wd doesnt eat, remove from the tank, but allow it to eat as much as it wants to in a 5 minute period.|`|RkK673VHaa	have you given it time to settle in or have u been playing with it since the day you got it, hangin around outside its vivarium and handling straight away rather than waiting for a few days. are the temps and humdity correct, what have u been trying to feed it, how have you been trying to feed it how often have you been trying to fed it. is it an adult, juvi, hatchling is it WC or CB. any other information u can think of that might be helpful
oMmBhWK4aa	Sometimes medication can have the side effect of reducing the oxygen level in the water, hence it may be prudent to run an airstone during the medication period. Kuhli loaches need well oxygenated water and may rise to the surface if necessary. Also check your water parameters for toxin levels and that your filter is not clogged. The medication may well also be affecting them as loaches are quite sensitive. Other than a major water change after course of medication has ended, you can also use activated carbon for a short while to remove any residues.

In your situation you are better to get one from a puppy, because staffies are such an abused breed that sometimes they end up being nasty through bad treatment and ending up in rescues...if you go to a rescue, you can probably still get a puppy staffie that can be socialised with children.<br>  <br>  Please remember to never leave ANY animal unattended with babies and children, no matter how well behaved the animal seems.|`|C3SSoB4caa	actually pit bull terriers are great with children, when raised nicely they. have such an eagerness to please their owners and they build such great social bonds with their family that they can become very loyal attentive pets.   retrievers are good too  or try herding dogs they are fun loyal and are breed to take care of other animals (or kids) avoid the excitable breeds aka ankle bitters,|`|GBI18gjpaa	Labrador retriever!

They are the right size,  not so big & boisterous that they knock the kids down. but still tough enough to take anything the average (non abusive of course) kid will dish out.  They want to please, and are protective of their kids.  <br>  <br>  Staffies have a bad rap because they look like pit bulls.  But they are a separate breed.   (Even though I like pit bulls also)<br>  <br>  Labradors, even though they have a great reputation as family dogs, can be VERY energetic and rambunctious until they mature.  Many take years to settle down.

oMmBhWK4aa	This situation illustrates why smaller tanks are so problematic and beyond the ability of most novices to handle. Unless you really have a severe space constraint problem, at the very least double your tank size and maybe get a better filter in near future.<br>  <br>  But for now, stop messing with pH using chemicals as the pH can yo-yo and give fish extreme stress. The pH scale is logarithmic, each step is 10 times the previous one. pH 5 is 10 times more acidic than pH 6 and 100 times more acidic than neutral pH 7. The same applies for alkalinity the other way. So what seems like a small pH change to us is very detrimental to fish. Your fish are ok with your current pH range. It's far more important to have stable pH rather than try to achieve any textbook pH value.<br>  <br>  As for ammonia, the value must be zero as this is very toxic, more so if your pH becomes alkaline. Other than the factors of tank size and overloading, perhaps your filter isn't performing well. To tackle ammonia & nitrites, you need established biological filtration. Those filters using replaceable cartridges are next to useless for this purpose. But there are workarounds. <br>  <br>  Never simply throw away the old one & immediately change in the new one. If the cartridge can be re-used, simply rinse using old tank water. If not, run both cartridges together for a week before removing the old one. If the filter has space, get a filter bag and fill with some bio-media like ceramic rings & sintered glass. Place the bag in, ensure it's not jamming anything. Never throw away this bag, you just need to periodically rinse off any clinging dirt with old tank water. This way, you have a permanent colony of beneficial bacteria on the bio-media, regardless of what you do with the filter cartridges.<br>  <br>  You can also use activated carbon and zeolite to help remove toxins but these need to be replaced regularly, after every few weeks. For emergencies, have on hand anti-ammonia solutions that neutralise ammonia quickly. For example products like Seachem's Prime and API's Ammo-Lock.<br>  <br>  Just saw your additional details, why are you using salt on softwater fishes? The majority of freshwater fishes do not need any salt added at all, indeed some are sensitive to salt. The only ones that benefit from a bit of salt are mollies, some killifish, archer fish, goby, puffers.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Take my suggestion and don't try to lower or raise the pH level. The first reading of pH is definitely an error. 5.4 is too acidic for any type of fish and will mean the death of any fish.<br>  <br>  The reason for your ammonia is that you have such large bioload for such a small 10 gallon tank. The beneficial bacteria simply cann't handle the ammonia produce by those fishes. <br>  <br>  Parrot fishes, pleco and red tails grow too large for 10 gallon. Even these 3 this small is too much for a 10 gallon tank. And that is the reason for the high ammonia. You will never be able to keep it down till your get rid of the fishes and get fishes suitable for 10 gallon.<br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|0iAGnjFvaa	they make PH balance drops you buy in a pet store<br>  <br>  or... ammonia is a technically a base, you could simply add some vinegar (which is an acid) and that will help balance out the PH<br>  <br>  vinegar is natural and a bacteria killer, it will not harm the fish, i even clean my fish tank with vinegar|`|ak9DrBSwaa	You really need a bigger tank, since the pleco will quickly outgrow it. Partial water changes to get the amonia levels down. The ph going up and down from the additive is likely more harmful than leaving it be.|`|o0JPvYX6aa	put a shark in it!

Guard dogs do not. <br>  Take some time and research both of these breeds. They have very different needs. Make sure you can and are easily able to meet the  needs of the breed you choose. <br>  Dobermans require more training and much more consistency and a firmer hand than the shepherd. The Shepherd would make a better family dog if you have small kids.

Both those dogs are very large, need a lot of food and mountains of exercise but make great companions and co-workers.|`|3uIOlUo7aa	As has been said, neither.  If you need protection, get an alarm system.  Do not rely on any dog, particularly one ignorantly obtained of any breed, to protect you.   Most any dog will bark and any large dog will be a deterent of sorts but you cannot rely on one as protection.   I have been protected repeatedly by my dogs but then I obtain properly bred, temperamentally sound representatives, train them and bond with them well and do not rely on them for protection.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	To guard your posessions get an alarm system.<br>  <br>  both GSDs and Dobes make great PETS|`|bDsIgFoXaa	Doberman Pinschers have less hair and don't shed as much.

sBn7D0h4aa	Actually my dog just got over kennel cough (bordetella) and it sounds somewhat similar. My dog also did this type of reverse cough thing and a few times had a greenish snot like mucus run from her nose. She also hacked and would cough up clear liquid mucus. But it would seem strange if your dog also had kennel cough like mine that the vet wouldn't have known right away that that's what it was. especially after doing all those tests? hmmm.<br>  <br>  But i would definitely get a second opinion since my parents dog one time had a small lump on his foot and the first vet we took him to said that they were going to have to do check it for cancer and all this stuff that was going to be some outragous amount of money. Got a second opinion form another vet and gave us some drops to put on it and it went away in no time. So sometimes it is much better to get a second opinion lol.
VhWll8Vjaa	If he is actually doing all of his poo's and wee's inside the litter tray, then yes... he is doing fantastic!<br>  <br>  I find boys can be a little more untidy when it comes to toileting than females. I have two Ragdolls, my male doesn't cover up his poo... but my female will aways cover hers up. Don't worry about that too much.<br>  <br>  With him gettins some stuck to his bum, this can happen if the cat has long fur and is normal. Or it's just down to his age. Just because he uses the litter tray does not mean he is an expert quite yet ;-)<br>  <br>  My male was the same, I find it takes a while for them to use it properly without any mess. My male now uses it perfectly, with no poo stuck to his bum because he is more patient and sits inside the litter tray better than when he was a kitten.<br>  <br>  He is still very young. Most kittens don't even leave mum until at least 8 weeks old. If they are pedigree, then it's 12 weeks old.|`|PiMcAb0Haa	Hi there<br>  i have only had my kitten for 2 weeks now (and she was 6 weeks old too then like your kitten).<br>  I found when i first took her home she suffered with a runny bottom and kept getting covered in it. She tried to cover it up with no joy but what i have been doing is as soon as she does a poo i will go over with the scoop and cover it, she has been watching and now has started to do it herself.<br>  What food has your kitten been on? Maybe you need to change its diet slightly as it sounds like abit of constipation if it is not coming out properly.<br>  I weaned my kitten onto some kitten food with gravy just giving her a small amount each day and now her poo is fine, its not runny or too hard so she has no troubles.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Your kitten may have that problem because she was taken from her mother so soon.. a kitten shouldn't be separated from the mother unless its at least 10 weeks old.|`|TiAK1629aa	At 6 weeks old they have just barely learned to use the bathroom on their own....and they go through a stage that my husband and I refer to as "poo paws".  They're so small, it takes them a little bit to get the coordination right, so they step in it, or don't quite "finish" before they step away.  It gets better in a couple of weeks.  Just keep him clean and check him regularly.<br>  <br>  As far as the covering is concerned, not all cats will cover their poo.  I've heard it's a sign of they being the dominant cat and it seems to hold true in our house.   The largest cat doesn't cover his...and they are all spayed or neutered.|`|w2bHPA7raa	you just need to give him time to get used to his new surroundings. he will be a bit confused for the first few days. as for not covering it up, my cats sometimes do this. i have come to the conclusion that they have just gotten lazy and cant be bothered so i just have to clean the tray out lol. my cat also sometimes has it stuck to his bum afterwards aswell but i dont really know why.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	First off, you shouldn't have taken the kitten from its mother so soon, but it doesn't sound like you're having any serious problems, yet. If he's used the box, then things are looking up. But young kittens are messy and make mistakes just like kids do as they are learning. Clean his butt with a warm damp rag. You could try to cover his poop for him in the box but that does NOT mean he will start doing it. Dominant cats do not cover their poo.<br>  <br>  <br>  For future reference: A kitten should stay with its mother for an absolute minimum of ten weeks and preferably twelve. Although they may be "weaned" prior to eight weeks, they will still have the occasional need to nurse. Kittens taken from their mom cats before this time often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood.<br>  They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats. The time they spend with their mother and siblings is very important. Try to imagine how a human would be affected if you took him away from his parents at a very young age, and he didn’t have the proper role model to learn from. Often kittens that are separated from their mother too soon, have problems learning to use the litter box, or will be very withdrawn and shy, and/or have social problems with other animals as well as humans.|`|wD2V0Mnbaa	ur kitten is young and its paws are tiny.mine did the same thing.give it time it will learn itself . if it dosent then show it how to dig with ur own hands .my previos kitten learned it that way|`|BHKlCJR2aa	hes doing fine, be glad he uses the tray, my 12 year old has a tray but prefers to do it on the kitchen floor.
OA0tpzPuaa	I think it is better to be on and off of the bit. It shows the judges that you are trying and your horse can do it. You should get better scores being on it some of the time. That's what happened at my first show with my horse. I could get him on it every now and then. I ended up getting a 60 =] Also It doesn't matter for the intro tests but in the training level tests you should make an effort to try and be on the bit.|`|RloOJ43haa	You should attempt to be on the bit as much as you can. You will get better scores on the movements where you are on the bit and raise your overall score. <br>  <br>  Also, as you keep working on it, keeping a horse on the bit will become easier for you and you will be able to do it more consistently.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	You should try to keep the horse on the bit as much as possible.  You will get better scores for the movements where he is on the bit, and the overall impression that you will give the judge is that you are working on it.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Well, this depends on the level of the Dressage show. Beginning levels for younger riders, surprisingly, do not require to have your horse on the bit throughout the whole ride.... but it's always a bonus.<br>  <br>  As you get into high level Dressage shows, it is dire to have your horse constantly collected. I would just go in a low level class for Dressage for now.<br>  <br>  In the meanwhile, practice your collection at the trot and canter. Why is it that you can't collect him at the canter?<br>  <br>  There can be multiple reasons. I've seen some rider's who can't collect there horse just because the horse is slow. The rider said, "I have to completely focus on kicking him constantly... and I can't collect at the same time." I get what the rider is saying, but that is no excuse in a show. Just get a crop on him.<br>  <br>  But if it's because you aren't fully balanced, then you need to work on your seat a little more. For this, just do a lot of trotting and cantering without stirrups.<br>  <br>  Good luck =)<br>  <br>  But basically, it is always better, no matter what, to constantly have him collected in the show ring. And don't worry, practice makes perfect!|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Your horse should be on the bit the whole time except when you do the free walk across the diagonal KXM or MXF. At that point you go "on the buckle" and let your horse free walk. If you're not cantering yet you should do the Intro A and B tests. Here's a copy of the 2008 tests <a href="http://www.usdf.org/docs/tests/2008_Directory_intro_testsAB_movements.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.usdf.org/docs/tests/2008_Dire...</a><br>  <br>  Your horse doens't have to be perfect to start out with. If your horse is just safe...get out there and do it! You have to start some where! Have fun!!|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	since they dont have cantering in intro level tests...you do not have to worry about trying to canter on the bit.<br>  work on the basics for now.<br>  canter does not appear in any test til training level...and you are not there yet.<br>  into and training level only require forward movement with a contact. very similar to what u might see in the hunter ring. you really should not be trying to get the horseon the bit until you understand the basic principals better.  cranking a horse "onto the bit" does  not mean the horse is necessarily engaged...it could just be tucking its head in and still be all sp[rwaledout or disconectid with the rest of his body.  you will be marked down if your insistance of going on the bit at this time, interferes with the horses natural/forward motion.  ride within your level, would be my advice.|`|6GehblM3aa	A dressage horse should ALWAYS be on the bit and listening to you.  You'll find it much easier to ride when your horse is on the bit and listening.
0TTZERJmaa	sorry too much writing i cba to read this but thanks for the 2 points xx|`|IcH5gMICaa	I don't know about training a chicken.  Sounds like a shot in the dark.  I would be afraid that putting her back with the others would cause a "pecking order" fight that she would not win. Apparently, she is not very tough and after the last few dog incidences, she's not going to get any stronger. You know, I'm sure since it's the family pet, getting rid of it is not an option either, but chickens are not "house" animals.  They aren't going to ever use a litter box or not stink.  And when the molting begins, whoa.  <br>  <br>  I think I would purchase a small coop for it, possible situated outside but near your son's room.  Maybe even under his window so in the summer they can still be "near".  You'll just have to explain to him that in order for her to stay inside, he would have to do all the cleaning, and that's probably not going to happen, and that he doesn't want to be known as the "stinky people" on the block etc.|`|ILWnJXfJaa	You can't house train a chicken.  But you may be able to find a sight that sells diapers for them.  Chickens love to scratch for food and roll in the dirt for dust baths, so they really should stay outside.

4hFT5JcLaa	Put ads in your local newspaper. You can also place ads in online classifieds as well. If you have any stores around you with bulletin boards where people can put stuff, I would place an add there too. Try grocery stores, WalMart, and places like that, but make sure you're allowed to place the poster before you do. Good luck!|`|IFEIP5Doaa	Try craigslist, through your local exotics vets or even contact your local herp society.

7DpmGblgaa	fry can be very good at hiding in places throughout the tank and even in the gravel!! do u have any decoration items in the tank eg: bog wood? i had some guppy fry the other week and they seemed to bury themselves in the gravel and hid very well under the bog wood and some unfortunately got caught in the filter :( however i had 7 babies left and unfortunately now i have only 2 altho it was only a new tank! i fed them liquifry for the first week and have now put them onto a dust feed designed for fry. hope this helps a little bit.|`|tShDXmgbaa	Being that its only one fry...you can add some tank water to a 1-3 gallon container and feed it powderized crushed flakes but just a teeny tiny bit. Change the water out every 2-3 days and it should be ok.  You could even go buy a very small tank setup for the little guy.  If you add it back to the tank.. it prolly get ate just like the others if you dont have adequate hiding places for it.|`|ErSbeRlzaa	The fry wil get its colouration in a couple of months, Ill advice you to get a breeder net that you could hang of the glass on the aquarium and put him in there. Do remove him out of the water when you do it, put him in the breeder trap whilst hes still in it in other words.<br>  If the fry is a new born then he'll be able to survive for a day or so on his yoak supply which is a yellow dot around the belly area. This should give you enough time to go out and buy some proper fry food, i always use 'First bites'. Until you get it you can feed him regular flakes but you will have to crush it very Finley, near enough to dust.<br>  Good Luck
FQyeGsIyaa	Cats are active at night and kittens are so full of energy that they can seem like they're on speed.  My kitten learned how to open the sliding closet doors in the bedroom - of course she had to rattle them for awhile before they moved which woke us up.  We resorted to putting child proof locks on them to stop her.<br>  <br>  Try to establish a night time routine.  Play with the kitten before you go to bed to tire him out a bit.  They do learn the routine after awhile.  My cat has figured out when we turn out the downstairs lights and go brush our teeth, it's bed time.  She doesn't try to wake us up anymore by jumping on us, we'd either put her down on the floor or just roll over and ignore her, she'd leave when she didn't get the attention she wanted.  We do sometimes hear the thunder of a 10 lb elephant running down the stairs as she goes tearing around the house at night!<br>  <br>  He will calm down over time.

oMmBhWK4aa	According to Juwel's website, the dimensions for the Trigon 190 are 99 x 70 x 60cm and the cabinet is 99 x 70 x 73cm. 99cm should be the curved glass, so 70cm is the side and 60cm the tank height. The cabinet is separate from the tank but sellers are unlikely to dismantle the cabinet. So it depends on how much car space you have and if you can transport it safely without risk of damage to tank or cabinet. A small van or truck would be preferable to a car in this case. I suppose you are buying a second hand tank since new tanks should have delivery included.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	The cabinet is a flat pack, so I would expect the seller to have disassembled it, The tank is a 1 metre right angle, so if the front of the tank is facing the back of the seats it should fit at a squeeze.<br>  <br>  This is a pretty good review that might help you decide transit measures.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Juwel_Trigon_190__Review_5538929" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/Juwel_Trigon_190__...</a>|`|6KsGSDh5aa	All backseats are different.

pdbc4souaa	See your vet. I get into a lot of trouble when I start to practice law and medicine.

Your vet can evaluate the problem, make sure there are no obstructions in his colon.|`|CEgq26oHaa	My Dachshund had that same problem.  I took him to the vet and it turned out that he needed his anal glands expressed.  This is a common thing in Dachshunds because they have pockets in their anal glands that can become "clogged".  I'm not sure what type of food you are feeding him now, but I've tried all kinds for my dachshunds, as they are picky eaters, and they prefer Pedigree Lamb and Rice  over the rest.|`|IS4ND9Sjaa	a good brand if dog food will be good for him. it will take him time to adjust to the food but in time he will. if you're still worried about him then you need to go see your vet.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Maybe something you fed him was not meant for canines.... Or maybe you were supposed to do a gradual switch. Go see the vet because like Answerer 1 said, it could be something more fatal.|`|sW8eg01saa	i would suggest making his food but make sure he is getting the right nutrients that he needs. i have two mini dachshunds|`|oi66N5QYaa	I mix wet food with dry for my dog.  It;s called "Pet Promise".  It's more expensive than Purina and the like, but it is well worth it because it has no animal by-products in it and no additives. Your dachschund wouldn't require very much on a daily basis. Also 'Newmans Own' is good and 'Rachael Ray' has her own brand that is very good.  And make sure you don't over feed your animal.  The reason he is struggling is that the food is impacting his digestive tract. Commercial foods contain lots of sodium and that dries up the fluids in his digestive tract.   Giving him dry food only is a big mistake. Hope this helps
AA11901352	They are egg layers.<br>  <br>  These fish have never been bread in captivity.|`|JEaTBC8Vaa	Yes|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Yes they do. Same as all fish in the Trigger family. According to Fishbase they may be nesters which guard their eggs against predators. Not a whole lot is known about their reproduction as they are not bred in captivity.<br>  <a href="http://www.fishbase.org/summary/speciessummary.php?id=1311" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishbase.org/summary/speciess...</a>|`|h4wNRqf9aa	All triggers are pelagic egg layers, yes
ICvNW8OSaa	play with her alot during the times she sleeps irregularly. Make her run alot, make her chase you, take her for a walk. Because then chances are she will come back to her routine to normal sleeping habits, since she was so tired and since you worked her out.<br>  <br>  But then again I never had a dog so.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Yorkies are small, meaning their bladder is small.  Maybe she just really can't hold it all night long.  Take away her water bowl an hour or two before bedtime, then bring her out a few times before bedtime.  Play with her and hopefully she'll be tired enough to sleep through the night.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Because you get up and play with her at 4-6am!  She's got you trained well!  Ignore her barking, put her in a quiet room separated from the rest of the family if necessary, and go back to sleep.  Or, get up, let her out to go potty, let her back in and then go back to sleep and ignore her.  If she's young she may not be able to hold it as long as you want to sleep...that's just part of having a puppy.  Be prepared for the barking to get worse before it gets better because you have reinforced it for so long.  But if you stick with it and don't give in she will learn that she isn't going to get what she wants by barking so she might as well give up.<br>  <br>  Dogs and other canines tend to be most active at dawn and dusk by nature because in the wild this is when their prey is most active.  Dogs can learn to live with a human schedule, but you have to teach them how.  My dogs are always up for a walk at 4am if I get up that early.  But if I decide to sleep in until 8 they will remain quiet until I get up.  This is because if they try to wake me up before I am ready they get ignored, or sent to their crates.  Since waking me up doesn't get them what they want (and usually gets them the opposite of what they want) they simply don't do it.  <br>  <br>  You could also try going to bed earlier.  Six am really isn't that early for a lot of people.  In fact, I'm up between 5 and 6:30am every morning including weekends.  Even if I didn't have dogs I would be up that early because I have to be at work at 8am and I need time to get ready.|`|XbpQkEYlaa	It might be that there is like a thing or noise that she hears that scares her when she wakes up. Or, she has a lot of long naps during the day which makes her wake up early in the morning. It could also be that you have a puppy and then it had to pee. Thats what happened to me when my dog was a puppy, I had to wake up in the middle of the night to let her pee, but later on when she was a dog it was ok.|`|SNZ62mY5aa	Do you have a yard or a separate room? Maybe you could buy your dog something to play with or buy her a dog house, or just a simple fence to keep her from disturbing you.|`|l7IdlcHSaa	let her out and shut the door keep her out side then go back to bed and toss one of her favorite toys out there so she can play with it and put her food and water out there to then go back to bed|`|gTRRjpqjaa	Maybe she just wants to play.

s4OtfZ7Gaa	it sounds like you may be active enough to own one, but it also sounds like you both have busy schedules. BC's are wonderful dogs, but they require alot of mental stimulation or they may become destructive. they are a breed who is bred to go out in the field and work all day, so you would need to provide alot of training and other mentally stimulating activities to make them feel as though they have a 'job'. not saying you shouldnt get one, just keep in mind that they are a breed who requires alot of training and work throughout their life.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Border Collies are very, very different from Labs.<br>  <br>  I would recommend trying to be around a lot of Border Collies before you decide on one. Maybe search for some dog shows near where you live....agility trials would be perfect!  Or look up breeders and go visit them.<br>  <br>  Even with what we may consider ample exercise, BCs can be very "electric". Individuals vary, but like living with a ADD child. This "energy" pretty much exudes from them. Few BCs are satisfied with "walks"..they need to RUN! They also need a lot of mental stimulation, games, a job, or they will make up their own. Like herding you, cats, the vacuum cleaner, broom, cars....running the walls, chewing up remote controls... You must challenge their brain. Remember, they were bred for stamina, working sheep all day long. <br>  <br>  Seriously, find some and get to know what to expect.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	apart from leaving it alone for 8 hours, you sound fine.  But, these dogs are very active and need a lot of brain stimulation so leaving one alone for an 8 hour strectch is a no go. <br>  <br>  As you say you can take the dog for a run before work, and  this would only be 3 days a week, PROVIDING you have a rock solid agreement that someone go and check the dog and let it out during the day, especially while a puppy where it will need to go out several times, then it might be OK.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to train the puppy from a young age, enrol in a training class and consider doing one of the many anctivity sports with the dog. <br>  <br>  Be sure to ONLY get a dog from a v ery reputable breeder who does all health screening and genetic testing. See the link below for what conditions and health screening you need to check for. <br>  <br>  A reputable breeder will offer unconditional help and advice for the dog's life and take back the dog at any stage if you cannot keep it. <br>  <br>  Always see the puppy in the home where it was bred, with its mother. <br>  <br>  Good luck. ps.

s4UZ83knaa	i think bella is a great name the pup will open its eyes around a month or so thats wat happened 2 my pup toffee he is almost 6months old you can try holding the puppy but u hav 2 be carefull|`|5rfnEQnGaa	I hope this puppy is still with its mother, at 2 weeks it is far too young to have left the nest. A reputable breeder will not let you take a puppy until it is 8 weeks old.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Do you have the puppies mother as well?? She shouldn't be out of her mothers care until at least 7 or 8 weeks of age. Leaving before then could ruin her socialization, temperament, biting, and health. It also could stress her mom. Your dog should be opening her eyes soon. Yes, Bella is a very cute name. No, it isn't too soon, however, you should hold her only if you MUST. I have no physical experience with newborn pups, however am very dog knowledgeable.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Puppies should be picked up and handled ever so gently every day, but only with the mother's permission, only once or twice for a minute or o, and only after hands have been washed thoroughly.  For the first couple of weeks, they should only be handled by the primary person who is caring for the whole litter to avoid contamination from the outside.<br>  <br>   Puppies eyes start to open around 14 days or so-<br>  <br>    Please make sure that the puppies are not launched into their new homes before they are ready, which depends upon the breed.  These larger dogs can and should go to their new families at between 7 1/2 and 8 weeks, or they will start to form a pack and not be as easy to train.<br>  <br>    All that having been said, how lucky are you to have a new puppy that you get to watch grow!  Bella is a lovely name, but you really should let her grow and develop her personality - I have often found that all the best of intentions do not necessarily mean that the chosen names fit the dog if they are picked too early!  And they have to wear that name for a very long time...<br>  <br>    Please make sure to have her spayed when she is 6 months old, so you don't end up with more dogs than you need - it happens fast.|`|oi66N5QYaa	Two weeks is too soon to start fondling your pup. Where is the mother??<br>  My grandfather used to breed dogs (german shepherds) and he wouldn't let them leave the mother before six weeks. Be patient and allow the dog enough time to awaken on its own. You won't be sorry
p1gzHgAraa	its downright illegal. just give it to a LFS. its not cool to release aquarium fish into the wild-it disturbs the natural habitat and introduces parasites and bacterial and fungal infections to the natural fish.. <br>  <br>  dont do it.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Yes they probably would. But putting Goldfish out into the wild would be breaking the law and could be introducing parasites or bacterial diseases out into a wild population of fish causing widespread problems.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Absolutely not. It is illegal to introduce an invasive species into the wild. The goldfish would likely die, but if not he could have an adverse effect on the native wildlife, which needs to be avoided. <br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of the cane toad, or the snakehead fish, or even garlic mustard? All choke out native wildlife.<br>  <br>  Creeks are full of fun stuff as it is, you don't need to add goldfish to them. In the spring, go out and flip some rocks- you're sure to find some salamanders. I'm farther north than you are and I find red-backed salamanders, two-lined salamanders, dusky salamanders, and you'll probably find more skinks down by you than I can find up here.<br>  Just don't take any of them home as it is also illegal in many places to remove local wildlife.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Don't you dare put those fish in that creek. Goldfish are also known as carp and they grow bigger according to the amount of water they have to swim in so they can grow very large in a short time. Here in Australia they are a menace in our waterways and rivers and have killed off many of our native fish species. They are bottom feeders and they churn up the water into a mud hole that other fish cant breathe in. They also eat a lot so other fish cant find food and breed like rabbits so other fish cannot compete. Please, please don't ever put goldfish down the toilet or let them go thinking you are being nice. They are toxic to other fish species and should be taken back to the pet store if you don't want them any more.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Catx is right...you would be breaking the law, plus introducing a creature that could do harm to locals (Fish). aLots of things sound cool but that doesnt mean you should do it! Plus putting the goldfish outside leaves it open to predators. Raccoons, herons and such will quickly dine on the poor fellow.  Please don't do this!|`|Jtd7kXQSaa	It is never a good idea to put goldfish in any water way. They can become a invasive fish. Think this over.

Warmer, safer, and they will be much happier and not prone to the dangers of outside.|`|TiAK1629aa	It would be much better for them to be inside, but if you have to put them outside, I would suggest getting a dog house and insulating it.  You could line it with carpet on all sides, top and bottom on the inside.  The more insulation, the better. You'll need a heat source too, maybe a heating pad.  You also need to think about getting them a heated water dish so the water won't freeze (look online in the dog products, they don't sell them specifically for cats).  Add plenty of bedding to the house and either get one with a flap they can go in and out of or put it in a place that the wind won't be able to get inside.|`|6GIjDiMpaa	I had to put my cat outside because he kept spraying.

If it is being a problem (spraying, pooping, scratching) address it in another manner like taking it to the vet.  If you can't afford to take it to the vet, you should find someone else to take care of it.  Just because cats have fur doesn't mean that they can survive through all cold weather.|`|wrhG6b1laa	buy a dog house. you know they look like an Igloo. put old towels in and it should pe prefect.
xSdnsSojaa	Well, you can't really "train" a tarantula. They are what they are. <br>  <br>  I've seen a few exceptions, but rosies are usually pretty docile. They aren't likely to bite unless seriously annoyed, and you really shouldn't be handling it anyway. Tarantulas are very shy and don't appreciate being disturbed. It will be much happier and healthier if you don't bother it any more than absolutely necessary.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	It is not possible to train a tarantula, either you have a nice one, a moderate one, flightly, or aggressive. This is imprinted on the animal, the best you can do is make it comfortable with more handling. But remember this is a wild animal, not like a dog or cat, they dontcare who you are you make the wrong move and you will get bitten.<br>  <br>  With that said, I have had adults, and I have had slings (baby spiderling). Right now I have 2 slings and I dont think I would go back to getting adults again. The problem with adults is more times than often they are wild caught, and are extreamly stressed out, have parasites, and you simply cant tell its age. You may end up with an ultimate (a tarantula in its final molt, old age) and it only live a few months for you. <br>  <br>  And talking to this great tarantula guy who goes to the reptile show all the time, I told him i was afraid to hold my little slings as they were small, still flightly because they were small, what was the best size to start handling them at? He said the more docial species are normally best to start handling at around 2" leg span. I have since this disscussion with him held off on trying to hold my slings as they are still on the small side. <br>  <br>  And as for the bite. Usually tarantulas first bite is a dry bite, which means they dont inject venom. The reason is they dont know  it can kill you or not, and it is hard to make the stuf, they would rather save it for when it will really work. And myself being bitten by a tarantula, people dont die by them unless you are specificly allergic to it, like ssome people are with bees. More than likely nothing will happen to you. And i have been bitten by a rosie before, I wont lie, it does hurt. The pain goes away in about a day. But if you know how to read your tatantulas body signs, you shouldnt have a problem. Start by gently transfering the sling into a deli container, or maybe a piece of cork bark, then transfer it to your hand. It can be scary when a big pink thing comes down at you from above. And most of all, sit down on the floor, on your bed, or do this over a table. Slings are more apt to run over bite, and a long fall to the floor can be fatal, even for an adult.|`|qwQhvIGQaa	u should get a baby let it know u and then train it it is possible to train a turantula
Cfk1kr8Daa	Do what puplovetft has described, and BE STERN with this dog.<br>  <br>   While Springers can be wonderful dogs, they also often need socialization and training to correct this sort of behaviour, or you will soon have a bite incident in your home very quickly.  Your dog is trying to get rid of visitors, plain and simple. and apparently he doesn't repect you, either.  Not good.<br>  <br>    You need to demonstrate to him that not only is this behaviour not acceptable, but also that you are in charge. No polite nudging, you need to have complete control over his actions until he has demonstrated that he understands you are the leader, and that he is not to act against any visitor.  That means having him wear a corrective collar and dragging a leash you can easily step on and yank, along with that stern NO when he goes for anyone.  Speed is important, as well.<br>  <br>    He is now of the mind that it is his house, and that he can (and apparently does) control your actions.  You need to change that immediately, or this dog will end up dead, either before of after he has bitten someone.  If this training doesn't seem to work, or he exhibits anything other than obedience once you put the leash on him and try to take control, consult a canine behaviorist - but think seriously and swiftly about the probabilty that this dog may not be a suitable pet.<br>  <br>    If you got him from a reputable breeder, speak to them promptly and let them know what is happening.  they should be aware of what they have produced, and what may be the consequences.  They should be part of the solution, as well.<br>  <br>    If you did not, that is the root of your problem.  Breeding good dogs is a hard job that requires knowing the background of the dogs you are using to make more, and the genes for temperament are more important than any others.  And now you know why.<br>  <br>    Don't spend millions on trying to train this dog if the short term result are not good. While some dogs can be trained, no dog of bad temperament and breeding can ever be trusted if they strike out when they are reprimanded in the proper way, by controlling their actions with a leash.  <br>  <br>    It may well be that he is taking up space that could be inhabited by any one of the thousands of nice dogs that are euthanized each day simply because they are extra.  Please don't let that thought escape you, if things don't go withl for him.. You deserve to have a nice pet that is worthy of whatever you give him - a comfortable home, good food and attention.|`|7DWTnXd3aa	I own a Jack Russell Terrier, and I have found a way to punish him where he tends to learn very quickly. I would suggest that as soon as he starts this behavior, quickly swat him on his backside, firmly say "NO!...BAD DOG!" and then put him in his cage for at least 15 minutes. It is very important that the cage be in a separate room and no one should give him any attention (if he whines, don't even tell him to stop). This makes the dog realize that he is in trouble. Some dog owners are afraid to use physical correction on their dog, and I am not suggesting that you abuse your dog by any means. But by using physical contact the dog realizes that his behavior is not allowed. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Thats a funny question. I love dogs that hump everything. Get him a stuffed animal and teach him to hump it. Then when people come over throw the stuffed animal at him.

Keep a leash attached to his collar (his buckle collar first, and if necessary to a training collar, preferably a pinch collar, later). When he even starts to "nibble" at the back of the coat or even look at it, issue a firm, meaningful correction.  The correction should be firm enough that he thinks twice about repeating the action.  Then give him a second chance to repeat the behavior.  If he chooses to not do so, praise him and give him a nice treat or appropriate toy to play with.|`|AA11244754	Gently knee him and tell him "no" also you might want to consider taking him to a professional trainer.

This will sting and burn for a few days even after you wash it good.  <br>  Next, sometimes they can get pricked by a thorn of some kind (roses, weeds etc...) these can also have the same effect of itch, sting, burn.  Also needs to be washed off...and doesn't last but 1-2 days.  Usually on the second day it's just an on and off again irritation.<br>  To end with, it could be some form of skin rash or allergic reaction.  You can try some benedryl cream...but do not put much on and just sit with your dog for about an hour or so (watch some tv or some activity) until it's fully dry.  If you don't have the time a blow dryer will help if your pup is used to it.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|9kTejB0uaa	If this was down to allergies, it wouldn't be just one foot being licked.  You should take her to a vet so they can have a thorough look at the paw as the longer you leave it, the worse it's likely to get.  Occasionally chewing at a paw relates to pain in another area of the body too.  But whatever the cause, it needs to be professionally looked at.<br>  <br>  Edit - thanks for letting us know what it was - I love it when we get an end to a story!!!

Licking paws is similar to chewing one's nails - it can be a nasty habit that is hard to break if you don't stop it quickly, no matter what the origin reason might have been.<br>  <br>    That, and if she has an injury, you don't want it to get infected.

In fact everything you do with your puppy should be training, but all training should be fun and play. Read on my site what you should or can train your puppy. To train the down stay you should obviously first train the down. You should really progress very slowly with the down stay. Always set your dog up for success. Never put him in a position that he will break his stay. In other words, do not increase the distance too fast and also not the duration of the stay.|`|s76aC4G8aa	You can start training him at 8 weeks, he isn't going to get it right away and it'll take a few weeks for him to pick it up but there's no reason why you can't start now training your dog.<br>  <br>  Keep sessions very short and exciting, they only have a 5 minute attention span so anything more than that is too much, also constant drilling of a trick is punishment to a dog, so make your sessions short and fun.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I start training them as soon as I get them home.

So as early as possible.|`|bDsIgFoXaa	As soon as you get him. start training early and you wont have a problem once they get older they are harder to train.|`|o0JPvYX6aa	i think u need to teach ur dog how to hump someone first!
kvHqnR5Haa	Teach him the "down" command.  I have been having the same problem with my 5 month old and since teaching him the down command he is getting much better.  When he puts his paws on someone or something I saw DOWN and pull him down - then I praise him and give him a little piece of a treat.  Then eventually he started doing it on his own without my help.  He still needs some work but it is definitely better!  This was especially frustrating when my two year old nephew would visit because he would knock him right over, even though he is only 6.75 pounds!  Good luck!|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Keep the dog on leash when visitors arrive (or even keep her crated until everyone is in). Tell visitors to ONLY pet her or give her attention when she has four paws on the floor. If they start to greet her and she jumps they should immediately withdraw and walk away from her until she calms down.<br>  <br>  If she has great difficulty calming even with that, have guests toss a toy or treat for her when they arrive so that she has another way to expel her energy. Or, teach her to go get a toy and bring it to people when visitors arrive.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	If you do not want her to jump on visitors you should NEVER allow her to jump on you. Dogs do what they get rewarded for. If she jumps, and you or anybody else say" o, cute little doggy" and pats her or even worse pick her up (did that happen when she was younger?), then she is going to continue jumping because atention is a huge reward.<br>  So if she jumps up, ignore her. I mean do not even say "no", do not make eye contact. And ask everybody else to do that also. It is the only way it is going to stop.<br>  Read more on dog training on my site.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	Get her to sit before you let them in. Get her to stay while you open the door and then stay until the person comes in, focussing entirely on you. Then give her a treat. Will take a few tries for it to work.<br>  <br>  If after a week of intense training this doesn't work, get the visitors to walk in, ignore the dog, not even look, go into the living room etc sit down, ignore ignore until she is calm, then you praise her and give attention.|`|ydUME5f9aa	well if you want the dog to stop being so excited.... have the guests ignore the dog until she calms down<br>  <br>  the dog will get upset about it but get over it and calm down after the guests notice the dog|`|NTrPoIeRaa	hi|`|6SeWCfUfaa	It's a trained thing.  It's really simple to train, but takes some time.  <br>  <br>  Get some friends to help you out.  What you do is start with the friends outdoors.  Have them knock or ring the bell.  Your dog will probably bark and carry on, you want to stop that using voice command, back the dog away from the door and ask for a sit or a down (I use down) in a place that's far enough out of the way that people can still get in the door.  Then tell the dog to "wait" and start for the door.  <br>  <br>  Every single time the dog gets up you stop your progress towards letting your guests in and say "NO, Wait" and put the dog right back in the exact spot you had it in.  At first, you might get a step away from the dog, then maybe two, then you might be able to get to the door but not be able to open it ... You just keep going and keep reinforcing that "wait."  Once you can put the dog in a wait, let your guests in and close the door behind them without the dog moving, you can tell the dog to say hi.  For this, give your guests treats and have them make sure the dog sits for petting before they get the treat.<br>  <br>  The surprising thing is that you can usually teach a dog this entire process in a few days and get them into a good habit with it in about a week - if you practice it everyday.|`|AA10912383	Like some others have said, you can use a command to teach her to get off of something/someone. But the thing is, if you're going to teach her any other commands (like 'sit', 'stay', or 'down' as in lay down) you need to make sure you don't use the same command for 2 different things. If you want her to lay down, say 'down'. But if you want her to get off someone or get down from something, say 'off'. Otherwise she'll get really confused if you mix the two up.<br>  <br>  It's hard work, and requires a lot of patience, but it works.
tShDXmgbaa	Again....Breeder nets are a death trap for fry as these type nets hold stagnant water as well as uneaten food.  You should not be moving the fry until they are big enough to survive w/o mom. Female convicts do a very good job of taking of fry and its good she and the male keep the tankmates at bay.  When you take them from mom...not only do you increase the chances of them dying but you also stop the parents from learning how to take care of the fry. My convict just laid about 50-100 eggs inside a piece of decor and they wil be hatching tomorrow.  There are lots of other tank mates but mom and dad of the fry are doing a wonderful job keeping them all on the other side of the tank. When the fry starts free swimming...I will then add a piece of divider to the tank so mom is no longer having to worry about them being eaten. You should know from past experience what happens when you move the fry too soon so this time...just block off some of the tank with a tank divider and let mom do her job.  Otherwise your fry will never survive.  You'll have more fry survive if you stop taking them from mom and dad|`|D178335Paa	depending on the type of breeding net it could be anything. I would suggest getting more plants whether it's real or fake ones for the babies to hide. java moss works wonders for this, though the filter does seem to suck it up at times. You could also go out and buy a 2.5 to 5 gallon tank and place the babies inside of it. The breed nets i find do stress the parents out, but no one knows if they create stress on the babies. i'm going to say they do because now they are in a scary confined area. If the breeder net, is in fact a net though, and there is a filter there should be no stagnant water inside because the water is circulated.

65kREIwQaa	As noted - It is quite possible that she is still acclimating and there is no need to be too concerned at this point.<br>  <br>  A couple of things are important to consider.<br>  <br>  First - the fish needs to be comfortable.  Make sure there are some places to hide, keep the lights off a little longer than normal, etc.  Sometimes it's even necessary to do some minor redecorating to reset the territories in the tank so that the new fish can make a space for itself.<br>  <br>  Second - don't panic and overdo it with food.  We tend to worry about our pets and start trying everything we can.  With fish and food this can be a problem as excess food in the tank will foul the water.  <br>  <br>  If you can call the store where you purchased and ask what they were feeding, if it was a flake or sinking foods as well as the times of day.  Fish get used to certain patterns and it takes some time to change them.  This might give you insight into what is happening.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new fish.|`|H0fXySX9aa	Sometimes it can take a few days for them to become used to a new home...I would try with the fish food again tomorrow and if still nothing try something new...you may be feeding them something else than they are used to eating. Also make sure all of your levels are normal, temperature is right

fGwZMglGaa	Gerbils:<br>  Gerbils like to take a sandbath. Just when they find a fine sand, they roll themselves with a very fast body movement. This is obvious because gerbils like to be cleanly. Autogrooming gerbils spread a dark red lipid substance from the Harderian gland to their coat surface, so it becomes a little darker and the warmth from sunlight is better absorbed. However sandbathing removes the dark lipids and so it is slightly regulating these absorbent abilities of the coat. <br>  <br>  Wild gerbils like to eat seeds, flowers, roots, leaves, and insects. You should feed your pet gerbil every 1 to 2 weeks. When you feed your gerbil you should check the water. Pet gerbils like to eat lettuce, carrots, banana peels and food from pet stores. If you feed your gerbil banana peels don't give them too much at once. Gerbils love to gnaw. They are probably the most well know gnawer next to the beaver.<br>  <br>  Gerbils make homes under the ground called burrows. Just like almost any other rodent there are rooms for sleeping and eating. The entrance to the burrow is round and is made a certain way so wind can't get in. Sometimes gerbils will build their burrows right next to each other and form a colony. Since gerbils are most active during the night they mostly stay in their burrow eating and sleeping.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hamsters:<br>  Hamsters need to be able to chew, and they need to be able to exercise. Hamsters really were made to run, so a running wheel is a must. A hamster wheel must be large enough (many hamster wheels are more appropriate for dwarf hamsters than Syrian hamsters), safe (no wire wheels, please), and for your sanity, quiet. For chewing, a variety of wood structures and toys will help keep your hamster's teeth in shape. Hamsters also tend to like play tubes and tunnels and things they can climb on.<br>  T he basic fodder should be lean seeds (not oats), rich in carbonhydrates, with the addition of fresh plant stuff such as vegetables or fruit. Avoid sour fruits and lettuce. Neutral additions of powdered vitamins and minerals may be strewn over the food in recommended amounts. Make sure that the fodder is adapted to the hamster in a sense of size, even though the hamster is a rodent. Concerning the teeth of the hamster single measures should be taken, so that the animal gets a supply of chewy pieces, either usual, unprepared wood, or chewing biscuits or stones specially made and sold in stores for that purpose. The hamster must have a supply of fresh water. Choose a water bottle designed for hamsters. Make sure that the animal learns to drink from the bottle, in case this doesn′t happen by its own initiative you must help it by carefully feeding it with the lip, so that it learns the connection. Without the supply of fresh water the hamster may suffer from constipation. Be consistent in the diet and avoid fast changes. The hamster is not to be fed with sweets, especially not chocolate. Calcium shortage may be prevented by making sure that the animal has access to a mineral stone. <br>  <br>  <br>  Gerbils are social animals and like to have a friend of the same or opposite sex in their cage<br>  Hamsters are solitary and like to be alone.<br>  <br>  But both are friendly with humans and fun to play with and easy and cheap to keep.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|46eG0VfEaa	gerbils are sociable animals, they like living together (girls anyway, in my experience)<br>  they will chew anything so need lots of toys/the inside of the toilet roll things to run through and chew.<br>  apparently they are very prone to cancer though, the same as rats.|`|MIkJXGN0aa	Because they are sweet,cudlly.They don't ask for much only food and fresh water.If you have an cage alredythat's even better becuse you don't need to buy a new one and no need to spent much money (you can mention this in your essey).They are so cute because you can hold them and cuddle them.They can make your moood go up and help you if your crying (as mine did to me).They just need love,like us kids.Imagine if you didn't get enough love,would you be alive?And in the Zoo they don't have much love from the Zoo workers.They just work,they don't play with the hamsters.So you can tell your dad they if you buy one he will live long and healthy life and have much love.If you still need something more you can go on a site or...I could tell you some more.Well:Hamster need love and care (as I said before), but they need soemthing else also.They need someone to "talk" to.Now you think I'm weird...I'm not...I know exactly how hamsters talk...and if you buy a hamster they need someone else to talk to...even you can't understand them they can understand you (from my own expirience).They talk to you about their life,their sadly or hapily lifes,their families or anything/one else.They are a rear type of animals with a rear type of lifes.If they don't have anyone else (except hamsters) to talk to, they will die.When you want to talk to your hamster/s you talk to them on your language, and they understand you (if you mention this to your dad,he will surely buy you a hamster).If you need any more things you can go on the Internet and find some more things about hamsters/gerbils.<br>  <br>  One more tip: In the essay,write about your old hamster and how did your dad bought you the old one,and if he liked the old one,mention that too.
iVQULHqYaa	Instead of thinking about the op, imagine the dreadful deceases she could get if she is not spayed. Imagine the dogs queueing up at the dog if she comes into season and imagine her being stuck at home because she cannot go for walks. Also imagine how unhygienic it could be when there are blood stains on the carpet and your baby is crawling..<br>  <br>  You don't have to imagine how devastated that you would be if you could not get her puppies a good home and you don't have to imagine how stupid people can be with puppies. Even if you did home inspections, the chances are that some of her puppies would be dumped.<br>  <br>  I carried my dog into the house after her op, put her carefully into her bed.She ran out of an open door and did a long jump from the patio and dropped four feet into the garden. I was horrified, however she was OK. Your dog will be home with you tomorrow night and she will be fine.  Enjoy your dog and your new baby.  A new baby and a young dog, I envy you.|`|rVbY5qBsaa	Don't feel bad.. you're not a bad person for getting your dog spayed. It is the responsible thing to do. She will be fine and you wont have to worry about having male dogs around her. Most dogs are spayed/neutered.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It is a very routine operation and there is no reason to worry in a healthy puppy. She will be under for a very short time and will be monitored at all times.

It is the responsible thing to do and your dog will be much happier as well.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	aww i know how you feel ,but yes your are doing the right thing|`|JsBb732Maa	She and you will be fine. Spaying is a routine procedure and the vets are really good at it. It's the best decision and your dog will be so much healthier for it. She'll be a little sore the first day and then you will have to work at keeping her still to not tear her stitches, she'll forget all about the surgery, believe me. I've had several dog done and they all are in great shape. :-)  Great for you to get this done!|`|ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	You are doing the right thing, there are too many unwanted dogs in this world. Having a dog in season would be a nightmare when you try and take her for walks. Unsnipped male dogs can sense a ***** in season over a mile away! You'd be besieged by them. Make sure she gets plenty of exercise once she has recovered as spayed dogs can put on the beef. The operation is not bad and she will recover very quickly as she is young and healthy. There is no relation between your pregnancy and her getting snipped.|`|ezT7xruoaa	It's not bad at all, stop imagining nightmare situations. The vet is a professional, qualified medic and will treat your dog right. Yes she might have a tube down her throat, but they will put it in after she is anaesthecized and also take it out before she wakes up, so she'll never feel a thing. <br>  <br>  You are really doing the right thing, she will not get STDs or cervical cancer in her life because of you! <br>  Also I read that sex for dogs is really painful, so your sparing her that as well! =) That and the heartbreak when the other dog dumps her for someone younger, haha.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Do the responsible thing and get your dog spayed. Your preventing more unwanted dogs from coming into this world. If your dog understood the benefits of getting spayed she would voluntarily go in for the operation. <br>  <br>  its funny because, most people that decide to not spay their pets, always say " well Im going to be watching my dog, or "  I will always supervise her" But eventually, then they end up coming on yahoo asking: " HELP!

Of course there are always risks involved with any surgery (anaesthetic) but this is such a routine procedure that you really don't need to worry.  Think about what might happen should she develop mammary cancer or other female condition later on.  You will be preventing this from happening.  For the sake of a few moments (in a life-time) discomfort, this surgery is nothing.  You ARE doing the right thing.  She will be asleep during the procedure so she won't have the faintest idea about what's going on.  Yes, she will be sore for a while, but she will bounce back, and live a happy and hopefully long life - also without having to be confined twice a year too!!<br>  <br>  Make sure the vet advises you how to deal with her when she first comes home, and don't hesitate to phone them if you are at all worried about her, but she'll truly be fine!|`|Os6VjLH0aa	Spaying is not necessary IF you are prepared to keep your girl in sight or locked up tight AT ALL TIMES during her seasons, which usually run for three weeks at a time around twice a year. <br>  Male dogs can smell a ***** in heat for a 3 MILE RADIUS!!!! You will have to deal with males hanging around your house, your girl trying to get out to get to them etc.....<br>  Spaying is a very safe, effective way to deal with this whole situation, there are a few drawbacks, as with any major surgery, but, the benefits far outweigh the risks.|`|kceGobAXaa	aww, don't worry hun.<br>  <br>  it is normal for you to be worried, but she will be okay.  your vet has done this many, many times before, i assume.  try not to think about it tonight because it will just drive you crazy.  believe me, i have had to bring my boys in a leave them there for a day or a few and left bawling my eyes out.  but every time, they were just fine.  <br>  <br>  your doing the right thing.  and she wont even know what happened.  most times you can get them back in the afternoon or evening and she will be so happy to see you.|`|btHait6kaa	No it's not as bad as you think, she will be fine. Just try not to pick her up a lot for the next few days!! Dogs don't get hurt as easily as humans do.

Its best to do it if you dont want her to have puppies, and its not cruel at all. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|1tiCB311aa	You are doing the right thing. Spay her please. In the long-run it will be better for your pet and you will prevent numerous health problems for her.|`|bsqSaXhQaa	She'll be fine.<br>  It's an extremely common surgery and it's probably best for her!|`|LtbINp1jaa	sorry but theirs always something lacking in an animal that has been spayed. a little less boisterous perhaps is the best way of putting it.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Oh puleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze...........it'l... be ANESTHETIZED..... won't feel a thing!<br>  Do grow up,OK?<br>  MILLIONS of bitches are spayed daily,it's not rocket science.|`|430hwnLqaa	It is a simple operation no need to worry|`|2efNoOYaaa	I work at a veterinary practice so i get a lot of owners thinking this.<br>  <br>  Spaying your dog is for the best, honestly! It is a routine procedure with little risks, the dog will be fine after its operation, you'll have to do your best to keep it quiet for a few days afterwards but she'll probably want to play! She probably won't notice. This is the best thing to do and it will greatly reduce the risk of mamory tumours: by 98% if before the first season! so you may think that you are hurting her but she won't feel a thing, she'll be well looked after and you sohuld be able to take her home the same day that she has the operation!|`|8aOTvtEUaa	I know you are worried, In a couple of months mine has to get spayed and I will be just has nervous, but it's simple procedure and it's the right thing to do, she will be fine. It's good to get her spayed so she doesn't have puppies, but that's not even the main reason to get her spayed, by getting her spayed you are eliminating Mammary cancer, Ovarian cancer and cysts, and Uterine cancer, I forget what it's called but our dog trainer told us of one cancer that once she gets it you have 24 hours to treat it or she will die and the operation is around $3000 but if you get her spayed she will no longer be able to get this cancer, I'll have to look in my paperwork it might be one of the ones above I mentioned. You are absolutely doing the right thing, this little operation is nothing compared to if she were to get cancer.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	You are doing the right thing... Spay and Neuters are routine surgeries at vet clinics. I'm not going to lie and say you don't have to worry at all, as every surgery has risks. But the risks of surgery really outweigh the risks of leaving her intact. Plus the pup is young and healthy. You could always ask for bloodwork(for anesthesia) to be done prior just for the extra sense of security.<br>  Here are some risks of keeping your dog intact beside just having puppies...<br>  <br>  PYOMETRIA is one of the life-threatening risks that every intact ***** faces. classically it comes along in a certain time-frame after having been in heat. ie it is caused by being in heat as that is when the cervix and uterus are particularly vulnerable to infection. Spaying at any age eliminates this risk. (no uterus means no possibility of uterine infections.)<br>  <br>  BREAST CANCER is the other big life-threatening risk that every ***** who has not been spayed prior to her first heat faces for the rest of her life. While it is not necessarily understood why spaying before first heat almost totally eliminates the risk of breast cancerr , nor why spaying after the first and before the second heat cuts the risk in half, the risk statistics are well established and should be well known. The normal risk of breast cancer for the ***** who is intact or who was spayed after the second heat is quite significant and many bitches die of breast cancer. canine breast cancer can vary wildly in its degree of aggressiveness. sometimes even very early detection and immediate total excision surgery is not enough to save the unfortunate *****. and so often detection is not early -- bitches don't get to do monthly self-palpation exams (we guardians have to do it for them) and they don't get mammograms.<br>  <br>  UTERINE CANCER and OVAVIAN CANCER are obviously life threatening risks for any intact ***** and are totally eliminated by spaying at any age|`|jQxlZP6paa	It has been a long time since I worried over a puppy but I routinely worry about cats/kittens since I do a Trap/SNR program.  I rely on the vet and I worry each time, even though they aren't my own.  Techniques have improved greatly over the years and I included some info. to ease your mind.  Your puppy is lucky to have such a loving owner.  I would also share your anxiety with the clinic staff as they should be able to help with your stress.  It is also a bit disorienting and scary to see them after the surgery so prepare yourself as she will need you to be strong and let her know she is safe and loved when she comes out of surgery.  I think you're doing the right thing.  Congratulations on your pending delivery.
Z9zzNYNCaa	YES!<br>  ALL stages of growth are ***APPROXIMATELY*** the same in a species.<br>  NOT breed specific.<br>  <br>  Note-approximate...average   NEVER precise.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	Yes they do, most puppies end up losing their teeth between 4-6 months. By 8 months their teeth should all be adult teeth.|`|geJM58L2aa	My husband and I hadn't even realized our puppy was losing her teeth until I saw her chewing on something and grabbed her so I could get it out of her mouth.  It was a tooth!  Puppies don't always spit out their teeth when they lose them.  They actually swallow most of them.  But we noticed that when she was 5 months old and it only lasted 3 weeks.
UIM8X38Oaa	Its simple.<br>  <br>  IF you already plow rein then:<br>   <br>   while turning to the left, first looking to the left, then right leg pressure then place the right rein on the horses neck and begin to apply pressure while picking up on the left rein until she turns her head and takes a step to the left then release your  reins and legs and start over.  practice both sides.<br>  <br>  Just make picking up on the left (or inside) rein to plow the last que you give her.<br>  Be consistent with your ques and she will get it very quickly.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the spelling lesson everyone :)|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'll post one link on how to do it.  But all you need to do is google "how to train neck reining" (no g in reining), and you can get several training methods explained by different trainers.  Hope this helps.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/horses/the-basics-of-neck-reining/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/horses/the-basic...</a>|`|RloOJ43haa	R - E - I - N - A rein is used to control a horse.<br>  <br>  A reign is the rule of a king or queen.|`|WHA2TpPQaa	Assuming the horse doesn't know how to neck rein.... Use two hands. To go left, take the left rein and pull it out to the left and cross the right rein over her neck. Also squeeze with your calf (to go left, right calf, to go right, left calf). Slowly weaned off outstretching the left rein and she'll figured it out real fast.<br>  <br>  And when I say pull I don't mean PULL and yank, just gently take the rein, outstretch it away from the horses neck and put a little bit of squeezing pressure to the bit.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	An easy way is with a ring snaffle, cross the REINS under the horses neck, then ride like you are neck reining. The rein will pull on the opposite side while laying the other rein on his neck. This leaves you with a free hand, also.|`|JDJ6ofTUaa	ok well teach her to move away from pressure. while riding her, press the reins onto her neck then tell her to move opposite of the way your pressing. pretty soon she'll catch on that whenever you do that, she needs to move away from it.<br>  good luck!|`|pYF9KnNeaa	The technique you are talking about is "neck rein".  Meaning the horse responds to feeling the touch of the rein along it's neck.  If a horse has already learned it, all you do, (keeping both reins in one hand, assuming you are riding western) is to gently lay the rein against the side of his neck.  To go right, you would shift your hand towards the right.  That lays the left rein along side the left side of his neck.  A neck reining horse knows to turn away from where he feels the rein.  All this is one without putting any pressure on his mouth from the bit.  In fact, using a hackamore is a much better way to ride a well trained, neck reining horse.  Now, for a horse who has not yet learned this, here is what you do.   Let's assume you want him to turn right.  You will lay the left rein against the left side of his neck as described, and at the same time, VERY gently, give a little tug to the right rein.  That will coax him to turn his head to the right and go in that direction.  If you are working with a bridle that uses a bit instead of a hackamore, always be aware of the kind of pressure you are putting on the reins.  Never, ever be rough with the reins when they are attached to a bit.  Rough handling like that  can end up making a horse tough mouthed and can also cause them to start fighting the reins.  Always think about having a bit in your mouth with someone behind you, pulling on it and that will help you remember to be very gentle with it.  I hope that helps and good luck.
kWwgWSSgaa	Your puppy will play by the new rules as long as she knows what the rules are and they are consistently applied by everyone in the family.<br>  <br>  It will take time as you have allowed the behaviour to go uncorrected & your pup will perceive it as normal, but it is not to late.<br>  <br>  Either put your pup in another room when you eat, or if you want the pup in the same room, when it whines/barks for food a firm *no* or *leave* command.<br>  <br>  When she's in the house, put a house lead on the pup. If she tries to jump up, pick up the lead with an *off* command. The person the pup is trying to jump up on could raise their knee, so the pup couldn't reach them and say *off*. When the pup is quite, praise.<br>  <br>  Is your pup going to obedience classes? You could purchase a half check collar, when the pup pulls a quick check on the collar *heel* command & immediate release. It's a useful training tool if used correctly.<br>  <br>  Remember to be as quick to praise your pup as you are to correct her.|`|AA12128656	yes- you can and SHOULD abruptly STOP giving her food at the table. CHASE her from the table when she begs!!<br>  <br>  when she tries to jump on you, put your knee up to her chest (lightly, she's a pup) or grab her collar and push her down FIRMLY and say NO!<br>  <br>  when she's pulling on the leash, don't allow her to! pulling means you STOP! when she stops pulling, you GO!<br>  <br>  if you want an obedient and polite dog, quit letting her get away with all this stuff, and TRAIN HER!|`|wqL84O8Naa	yes, consistency can undo many wrongs.That being said, your dog is still a baby and still learning. As for the pulling during the walks, try a gentle leader or a harness that straps across the chest and under the legs. They are very effective humane training tools. At her age, she'd really benefit from some obedience training, most pet stores and community education centers will offer courses for under $100 trust me it will save you a fortune in the end.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	I understand cause I used to have a Dane that liked to sit in your lap.

YOU are giving her the idea that she rules the house.  She's just getting to that "teenage" phase of puppyhood, where she will be more difficult and start testing her boundaries now, so you have to change things ASAP.  You must be firm with her and not let things slide; she has to have clear boundaries of what she can and cannot do.<br>  <br>  An article on jumping:<br>  <a href="http://www.boxerworld.com/forums/view_help-my-puppy-jumps-up.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boxerworld.com/forums/view_he...</a>|`|bsqSaXhQaa	There is a way! Bad habits can be changed.<br>  When eating in the dining room, have her lay down in another room. If she gets up, and comes over to beg, scold her! Grab her by the scruff of her neck and drag her to where you told her to stay in the first place. She'll learn that she's not the alpha, you are. It sounds harsh but she will learn! My dogs sure did. They sit in the living room and watch us eat but don't beg. If they do beg, they are put in the basement, door closed.<br>  <br>  Jumping-When she jumps bump her chest with your knee. It'll be uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Pulling on the leash- Get a pincher collar. When with their litter and mom, the mom teaches them what's good and whats not by gently nipping the scruff of their neck. The pincher collar kind of stimulates this. When she starts to pull tug the leash with just enough force. She doesn't need to heel when learning to not tug. Just let her walk ahead but when she pulls tug the leash.<br>  <br>  We've done this with our lab and he's doing much better! He knows who's boss!|`|0ymlYQvnaa	Go to youtube and search KIKOPUP, theirs this girl who is awesome and spot on about positive reinforcers, tricks, negative behavior, and teaching your dog:]<br>  hope this helped|`|WQlCxeFlaa	lol you need to train her! You need to stop giving her food from the table. Get a rug...put it in the corner of the dinning room and teach her "Place". Have her sit on the rug, say "place" and give her chicken. take a step away, she's going to follow, point to the rug and say place. Keep pointing until she sits there and give her chicken. Once she's learned place.. when you eat, if she sits around waiting for food, ignore her. Dont look at her at all while your eating. If she starts acting up point and tell her "place". watch her go and sit on the rug..then ignore her. When your done eating and she's still on the rug, give her a treat and praise her. Get a gate for time out. If your in the family room and she starts misbehaving, put her in the gate, make sure she can see you, and ignore her. Once she quiets down you may take her out. With the pulling on walks. Go for a walk..when she pulls STOP! dont move...she'll look back at you gentley pull her back to your side. When she sits and waits, give her a treat and praise. It'll take a while..they'll be LOTS of stopping.. but she'll learn that she has to stay next to you.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps

WQlCxeFlaa	What you can do is train him to come to you with a whistle. Sit him in front of you, blow the whistle and give him some chicken. Once he associates the whistle with chicken..have him sit...stay...then walk across the room and blow the whistle again. When he comes to you, give him chicken. When he's learned to come when you whistle, you can try it outside in your back yard first. So its not to chance him not listening and running away. What your confidant he's got it down pack go to a park and have some one hold him on his leash... walk a good distance away...blow the whistle and watch him come to you. It'll be a lot easier to play fetch and what-not with out his leash. Also, about his energy.. What you can do to tire him out is ride your bike. Tie his leash to your handle bar and go for a ride. You can go faster on a bike than you can running, so the dog will go faster and loose more energy.<br>  Hope this all helps|`|p1gzHgAraa	ive had a husky before that literally you could walk it forever and it still was hyper. what i would do is call veternarians and breeders-anyone dealing with dogs and see if there are dog training facilities for dogs! id have him spend time doing training work-he needs to wear out his brain-along with his body to be happy.. <br>  <br>  find something he is good at-search and rescue, obstacle courses, etc.. that they can teach him- heck even swim rescue! he should love the water being a lab. also, go on the internet and search for groups like that in your area.. i would start by calling vet offices and searching the internet.. <br>  <br>  i also had a blue heeler my ex would show in frisbee competitions- he was super hyper and loved the workouts ..|`|JCozkN7faa	Labs don't calm down til their like 5!

nlYrYH42aa	I make my own reins.  I just use a poly lead rope, you can get them pretty much at any tack store.  I cut the snap off the end to the length that I want my reins then I burn the end to keep it from fraying. I attach snaps to the ends with leather folded over and tied.

ZT0K3q2Aaa	Simply put, PETA is running a campaign to discourage fishing, the mistreatment of fish, the eating of fish, sexual/mental/verbal abuse of fish, etc, complete with online petitions, insane propaganda, and a gross misunderstanding of the topic at hand. Nothing new there.<br>  <br>  However, what's so confusingly hilarious about this particular campaign is PETA's determined refusal to call the fish "fish", and insistence on instead referring to them as "Sea Kittens." To quote:<br>   <br>  “  Whoever was in charge of creating a positive image for fish needs to go right back to working on the Britney Spears account and leave our scaly little friends alone. You've done enough damage, buddy. We've got it from here. And we're going to start by retiring the old name for good. When your name can also be used as a verb that means driving a hook through your head, it's time for a serious image makeover. And who could possibly want to put a hook through a sea kitten?"<br>   <br>  <br>  —PETA<br>  <br>  To further the WTF-ness of the situation, the campaign is centered around a cartoony website that appears to be directed at children and/or developmentally challenged adults. The site contains flash games, lots of colorful animations, a store to buy Sea Kitten merchandise, and copious amounts of cute, condescending dialogue, making it look more like something you'd expect from a Powerpuff Girls fansite, rather than a webpage for an anti-fishing campaign. But you really have to see the site for yourself. Words can only go so far.<br>  <br>  And PETA continues to spit in the face of zoological science by also making up their own characteristics and taxonomy of Sea Kittens, seemingly oblivious to the fact that "Sea Kittens" and house cats are not even closely related in any way, other than both being vertebrates, or that fishing kittening actually helps keep Sea Kitten populations in balance. Although, Sea Kittens apparently don't mind being dressed up in goofy outfits and made to wear lipstick - just so long as that lipstick wasn't tested on animals, that is.<br>  <br>  Presently, it is unclear whether PETA are attempting to irreparably damage the minds of children around the world or are simply trying to wrest the crown of "Most Insane Organization on Earth" from the Church of Scientology - probably both.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Heh heh heh. PETA have decided that if they can get everyone to call fish 'sea kittens' they will see them as cute and fluffy and therefore be less likely to eat them. Good luck with that - I think fish are pretty cute, but they also taste good, I don't care what they're called; and I won't be the only one!<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|QdQcAHqaaa	In a misguided attempt to get people to stop eating fish, PETA decided to call fish "sea kittens" with the logic that no one would eat an adorable little kitten.  I think you can draw your own conclusions about how successful that campaign is.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	It's a PETA thing.  They're trying to manipulate people into thinking of fish as being the same as kittens.  <br>  <br>  Beware of PETA.  They don't want you having pets and want to turn you into a vegan.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	People don't seem to like fish. They're slithery and slimy, and they have eyes on either side of their pointy little heads—which is weird, to say the least. Plus, the small ones nibble at your feet when you're swimming, and the big ones—well, the big ones will bite your face off if Jaws is anything to go by.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you look at it another way, what all this really means is that fish need to fire their PR guy—stat. Whoever was in charge of creating a positive image for fish needs to go right back to working on the Britney Spears account and leave our scaly little friends alone. You've done enough damage, buddy.

AQsiugSpaa	Yup..You are right.. there actually is one benefit I can think of..  but not any to the cat. The  only one who really benefits from the surgery is the veterinarian who makes a substantial fee from this horrific surgery. Even the owner who thinks he/she will benefit will undoubtedly learn that declawing makes for more difficult and even worse behavioral and physical problems than having claws intact.<br>  <br>  The cons:<br>  1. Declaw surgery recovery means excrutiating pain for a cat. While most  vets tell clients that it is no "big deal" cats suffer needlessly. It is considered animal cruelty in 25 countries around the world, which is strong evidence that it is a barbaric practice. There is a town in California, which has also banned the practice. Maybe the rest of the USA will follow suit some day, when veterinarians really educate their clients with the truth about declaw surgery.<br>  <br>  2. Declawing frequently results in behavioral disturbances in cats. Often cats resort to biting, which is far more dangerous to humans than a scratch, once they realise they no longer have their claws for defense. Cats are smart and quickly learn.. <br>  <br>  3. Cats often will stop using their litter boxes as litter is very painful to their paws. Not only just after surgery, the paws can remain exquisitely sensitive to pain, and will often eliminate inappropriately. So if scratching furniture and carpets destructive behavior was a consideration for declawing to not get rid of the cat, the inappropriate elimination will certainly be a cause for surrender to shelter or abandonment.<br>  <br>  4. Cats often develop arthritis later on in life due to the disfigurement and misalignment of their toes.<br>  <br>  5. Cats need their claws in order to fully stretch out their bodies, which is essential to a cat's behavior. Toe amputation prevents the cat from fully utlizing their muscles.<br>  <br>  6. Cats need their claws for balance, and often to prevent serious falls from high places, as "altitude" is everything to a cat.<br>  <br>  7.Even people with compromised immune systems and other physical conditions which make cat-keeping a bit more "risky" can find creative ways to live with their cats and not get scratched. That is why soft paws are so useful.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, folks who are more concerned about furniture and carpets, and who don't take the time and make the effort to really research and use alternatives that are humane and that do work, probably should get a dog instead of a cat as a pet.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry I could not think of ONE pro actually makes any sense at all, especially to our beloved cats.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats with all their claws for over 40 years.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Declawing is only ever done for the convenience of the owner and the bank account of the vet.  (According the figures from the HSUS, declawing has generated more than $3 billion of income for vets).<br>  <br>  It has absolutely no benefits whatsoever for the cat and this is why vets in at least 25 countries refuse to do it.  <br>  <br>  Having a cat is not compulsory and those who can't cope with claws should choose a different pet, instead of using amputation to modify the cat to suit their requirements.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO the only time it might be warrented would be if the owner had a blood/bleeding problem - even then you could save the cat from being declawed and use the SoftPaws nail caps.<br>  <br>  I really see NO benefit of declawing.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	"Paws have claws.<br>  It's one of nature's laws."|`|gU34xa9vaa	You have more sense and compassion than some people who do have cats !! Sorry I have to say there in no benefit because there is no benefit, to the cat. The only benefit is to the lazy selfish owners who can't be bothered to train their cats to use cat scratchers,it's far easier to get the cats toe ends/claws amputated instead. <br>  We've had cats for 35 years, cats are born with claws for a reason, no one has the right to take them away from them,they need them to live a fulfilled life as a cat.If people don't like it that cats have claws, they shouldn't get a cat, it's as simple as that.  <br>  I'm sure you know its banned in 25 countries so far and many people are working to have it banned worldwide, most vets won't do it any more, it's just the money grabbing ones now who do.<br>  There has been so much research proving the dreadful outcome of declawing and so many people are against it now they know the truth, it's hard to believe some people still think it's acceptable to put their pet through the most painful mutilating procedure a cat can endure.|`|huEWXxmLaa	No pros to the cat, only all the cons already listed above and more besides.<br>  All the pros are for the owner who should never have had a cat in the first place !<br>  Do you know its supposed to be a last resort and yet some people have it done to little kittens, depriving them of their toe ends and claws before they've even had a chance to learn to use a scratching post ? How cruel is that ! I don't know how people who get it done think we manage where its banned. Cats are the most popular pets here, we love and respect them as they are, we don't want to adapt them or we wouldn't get them in the first place.<br>  One thing for sure and no one will convince me otherwise, people who mutilate cats, are not true cat lovers !|`|E4ib2SeGaa	I honestly cant think of any benefits that are of any importance.  People may say your furniture will not be scratched, nor will you, but I just don't think they are benefits - certainly not to the cat anyway.  The only benefit is in the vets bank account as far as I can see, the fee for the op, and the cost of countless examinations etc when the poor thing is left psychologically damaged.<br>  this is just my opinion, I am sure there will be plenty of pro declawers who will try and persuade you there are numerous benefits, but as I am sure you are a sensible and humane person you will see straight through them.|`|c4dny3nfaa	Pros ...to the cat...none man<br>  Cons ..to the cat...terrible pain from having its toe ends off, mental torment cos they've gone and the cat can't do what cats do any more.A fortnight before it can walk without it hurting, then arthritis to come in the future.Getting chucked out or stuck in a rescue centre cos of having to bite to defend itself, or go to the loo on the carpet cos its mutilated feet hurt too much to use litter. Then death because nobody wants it.<br>  Pros to the people who do it to their cat...they don't have to bother with teaching it to use a scratching post,their kids can molest it as much as they like .....until it starts biting. <br>  Best of all to them then, they can blame the cat for bad behaviour and get rid of it, get another poor little kitten as a victim and start again.|`|hetZz4c1aa	There is only one benefit that I know of.......and I cannot say this is a reason why a cat should be declawed.<br>  <br>  Many cats, perhaps millions are now living in good, loving homes because their owners now feel that they can have a cat.  That said the best way to prevent declawing is education and not bashing people who are not fully informed.<br>  <br>  In the past I have adopted cats who had been declawed and found them to be no different than any other cat.  But I always regretted that someone had thought it was necessary.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	the only benefit is your furniture does not get scratched. however, that benefit does not make it worth it.<br>  <br>  the most beneficial thing you can do, if you want a declawed cat is, dont get a cat.<br>  <br>  a woman near me just got mauled by a pet chimp, this is why i do not have a pet chimp.<br>  <br>  every watch an elephant go potty? i have no desire to clean out that litter box, so i dont have a pet elephant.<br>  <br>  i have a pet cat, so i dont own anything i would care about if it got scratched. have one cat that used to claw doorways, used two sided sticky tape. if i didnt like two side tape, i would have got rid of the cat.|`|G032Flc3aa	Oh yes there are benefits to the human owners who have their cats toes amputated, they can indulge themselves with expensive furniture and keep their pretty kitty sitting still looking out of the window with paws too painful to scratch sofa or curtains with and with no chance ever of going outside and feeling the sun on their backs because they just aren't safe. They can also excuse themselves from proper training of their cat to scratch in places where he is allowed to i.e. cat scratching posts, and they can also excuse themselves from supervising their children handling the cat who without claws has to take whatever a toddler or child hands out without being able to give an educating swipe with a paw.<br>  <br>  There are benefits to vets who line their pockets by charging exorbitant fees for surgery that handicaps a cat but allows the vet to buy expensive cars and expensive premises and retire early.<br>  <br>  But to the cat, the one who is deprived of toes, grooming, exercise, play, freedom and the means of working off his stress there is never, nor could there be, any benefit.  The cat it is who has to learn how to walk on mishapen feet, to learn how to use the litter tray with sore, sensitive paws, who has no first-line defence so has to use his teeth, who couldn't climb a tree to escape a dog or other predator should the day ever come when he finds himself outside either because a window has been broken, a door left open or because due to his probable personality change his owner had abandoned him.<br>  <br>  What I can't understand is this,  it isn't a secret that cats come with claws so why would someone deliberately go out and get a cat if they don't like the way the animal is made?  It isn't compulsory to have a cat, it's not as if anyone is forced to adopt a clawed animal they can simply not have one...it's as easy as that, and yet time and time again people whine on about cats having claws and scratching and how they are planning to modify the cat to suit themselves and I can't think why they think they have a right to amputate a cats toes for their own convenience.   They don't seem to equate a cats pain as important as their own, even if their own is from a piddling little scratch and the cat's is from a multiple amputation. Take away the option of declawing and then people would really have to think long and hard about having a cat, it is just too easy to haul them to the vet and have them declawed.<br>  <br>  And finally how do the people in the USA and Canada who try to justify declawing think that people in countries where it is rightly banned manage to have nice furniture and safe children? Can't they see that there are always ways to manage things and those ways don't involve extreme and painful surgery?|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Listing the so called "benefits" doesn't justify mutilating a cat. Any surgical procedure performed on an animal should be done to benefit the animal, not someone else. <br>  <br>  <br>  Before you decide to have your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: <br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|QRu0yM80aa	The only benefit would be had by your un-clawed furniture and scar free skin.<br>  <br>  The cons...Your cat could never leave the house, it would be defenseless (especially from other cats!) and totally dependent on humans (which goes against a cats nature.)|`|ZMhibe8gaa	There are no Pro's only Con's.

They are removed often for the health, comfort, and safety of the cat.  The only other time is something I think Pretty Kitty came up with, and that is if there is a hemophiliac in the house and injuries that would be slight to us would be severe to them.  Other than those (the 2nd being a very extreme case) there is no need to declaw an animal.  Its a lazy American practice and there is a damn good reason so many other countries  have banned it.  If people would just take time to train their cats, this wouldn't be an issue.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	CON - Well; there '''is no benefit''' to the cat. I can assure you of that.<br>  <br>   I am not going to go off on a tirade about people who declaw cats or get into the 'rights' and 'wrongs' of it either.<br>  <br>   Simply put; if you live in an environment where the slightest cat scratch is going to put you off; don't get a cat. If one is going to invite any animal into their environment that cannot be trained to respect same, then that animal should not be there in the first place. <br>  <br>   I am positive that there are alternate pets that one can secure without having to physically 'modify' them to suit the living arrangements.

WQlCxeFlaa	Its a new place, your dogs dont know those people. You just need to train them that people are ok. If your taking them for a walk and someone is coming, once you feel them lunge forward, as to jump or attack the person, turn around and walk away before they bark. You should get a neighbor to help you, as you'll have to do this many times a day. After a while they'll understand NOT to bark at a stranger. Once you can walk by someone and them not bark or lunge, give them a treat and praise them. As for the barking, distract them with a noise...you can just clap. When they start to bark, clap and say "NO!" it'll distract them so the person can pass. You can also use a squeeky toy. When someone is walking by, squeek the toy until they have passed. Give them a treat each time someone passes and they have no reaction. <br>  It'll take time and patience..but you can train them<br>  Hope this helps
Ka3fbxszaa	I do believe they do know when you are sick and are offering comfort to you. A few years ago I had pancreatitis and was very sick for several months. The whole time I was "down" and in bed, my two cats stayed with me. They took turns sleeping on my chest.<br>  <br>  I have also heard of cats in nursing homes knowing when someone is going to die. One particular cat would go to the room of the resident and stay with them until they passed. (I wish I could find the exact story...it was pretty cool)<br>  <br>  Okay...I found one link...there are tons:<br>  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2531239020070726" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnou...</a>|`|JbnvItGOaa	YES!  Cats can definitely tell when your are sick and also sad.  My cat aways sticks to me when I'm sick or sad or angry, and nuzzles me way more then usual. He's usually very quite but when I'm sick or feel sad or angry he looks at me and "talks" to me with this funny "chiiiruup?" sound.   He also cuddles with my sister whenever she's sick or crying.  And her cat (just turned 1 year) stayed with her when she was sick with a bad cough last week.<br>  <br>  I think my cat's the best in the world, but I know this is not unique to him.

Rw7gi86Naa	It is totally safe.<br>  <br>  "Catnip is the common name for a perennial herb of the mint family. It is native to Europe and is an import to the United States and other countries. The catnip plant is now a widespread weed in North America. Given to the right cat, catnip can cause an amazing reaction! The cat will rub it, roll over it, kick at it, and generally go nuts for several minutes. Then the cat will lose interest and walk away. Two hours later, the cat may come back and have exactly the same response. Because there really isn't any scent that causes this sort of reaction in humans, catnip is hard for us to understand. However, it is not an uncommon behavior in animals that rely heavily on their noses. For example, there are many scents that will trigger intense hunting behavior in dogs, and other scents will cause dogs to stop in their tracks and roll all over the scent. Although no one knows exactly what happens in the cat's brain, it is known that the chemical nepetalactone in catnip is the thing that triggers the response. Apparently, it somehow kicks off a stereotypical pattern in cats that are sensitive to the chemical. It's almost identical to the essence excreted by female cats, which is why tom cats seem to love catnip the most.  However, this doesn't explain why females love it as well.  <br>  Catnip was once thought to be an aphrodisiac, but scientist tests have squelched that theory.  Cats aren't attached to it until they are at least two months old.  If introduced to catnip prior to this age, most cats will not respond to it at all when they are older.  The herb valerian will give cats the same sense of ecstasy as catnip.  Valerian is a mild stimulant and, though it doesn't do any harm, it shouldn't be offered to cats with kidney ailments.  By the way, both catnip and valerian produce ecstasy through the odor, not the taste. The catnip reaction is inherited, and some cats are totally unaffected by it. Large cats like tigers can be sensitive to it as well. Very young kittens and older cats seem less likely to have a reaction to catnip."|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	You are right, it is a mixture of natural plant herbs. You are also right that it contains chemicals...the natural chemicals in the herbs. <br>  <br>  It isn't good to give them too much. They can get sick, but can't really overdose on it (they will stop eating and smelling it if they get sick). It makes them kind of loopy and disoriented if you let them have it all the time.<br>  <br>  I give mine a little bit every couple months, and that seems to do her just fine.|`|hHWxo5vIaa	its like weed for them
QEEweJUaaa	DOG BISCUITS.|`|GT6396BDaa	The best fruits and vegetables that are safe and healthy for dogs as treats are: bananas, apples(diced and NO seeds because they are toxic to a dog), blueberries, pumpkin(good for constipation), broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, leafy vegetables and green beans(dogs really love them).  <br>  Never give your dog these fruits or vegetables: Onions, tomatoes(In any form), grapes, raisins, garlic, mushrooms and avocados.  These are toxic to dogs and will make them very ill.  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	I've asked this question too and this is what people said to me:<br>  <br>  Apples (they contain potassium, which stimulates the immune system, and pepsin, which helps the stomach)<br>  * Broccoli (rich in vitamins)<br>  * Carrots (rich in vitamins, great treats to substitute for biscuits)<br>  * Cabbage (rich in vitamins, good for digestive system and skin)<br>  * Cucumber (good for teeth and bones due to potassium content; can combine with carrots to promote a healthy liver and kidneys; in juice form, a good diuretic … peel cucumbers unless organically grown)<br>  * Celery (chopped or juiced; can help with arthritis)<br>  * Garlic (removes waste from blood, can help repel fleas; use fresh garlic finely minced)<br>  * Green beans (lightly steamed; healthy and low-cal treat)<br>  * Parsley (can reduce allergy symptoms and aid kidney function; chop finely or boil parsley and add the juice over food)<br>  * Kale (rich in antioxidants and can help reduce allergy symptoms)<br>  * Spinach (very healthy; serve chopped)<br>  * Bananas (in small quantity; a coveted treat)<br>  * Olive oil (a tablespoon a day is good for skin and fur) * <br>  <br>  Personally, my dog loves people food as treats, and he won't eat dog biscuits anymore!  I cut up bananas, carrots, and greenbeans and put them in the freezer! He also loves broccoli!  And he loves them all with peanut butter as a special treat!  If you are trying to train, use chicken or hotdog, thats what works best for me!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	My dog gets carrots and apples for treats pretty regularly.  And he gets any left over veggies I might make myself for dinner.  Excluding corn and anything with onions. But basically, any green veggie is ok for your dog.

You aren't a dog.<br>  Dogs a carnivorous. Of course a veggie or fruit once in awhile probably won't hurt them but dog treats (even though they taste bad to you) taste great and are healthy for them.<br>  Though I used to work at a kennels and the owner is a dog breeder and she said the soft treats (Like pupperoni) are probably the worst when it comes to treats made specifically for dogs.<br>  I give my dogs Iams biscuits or Alpo biscuits and pig ears.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Peanut butter once in awhile and leftover scraps of chicken and turkey he loves too. <br>  But watch out with turkey on thanksgiving. The grease can be deadly. My pointer had some and suffered pancreaitis. She's ok now though.|`|p1gzHgAraa	pretty much they love sliced apples, banana-anything. <br>  <br>  i can tell you to never feed your dog chocolate, onion, and grapes. the grape seeds are highly toxic to dogs-and chocolate and onions are deadly. also, beer can kill a dog in large quantities. <br>  <br>  my dog loves bits of chicken, (any lean meat)-, he wont eat lettuce lol, loves apples, peaches, banana-a few licks of an ice cream bar. <br>  <br>  but i mainly stay with dog treats. btw i have tried dog treats on a dare-they dont taste good to me lol.. but my dog loves bacon bits (the dog treat), greenies, Good Life recipe treats, and some of the good smelling treats.|`|OkJp8W4naa	There are some Steps to Make Homemade Dog Treats<br>  <br>  1. Choose a recipe. From cheesy cottage cheese biscuits to apple-cinnamon pupcakes, there's something for everyone. You can play with the recipes too, try substituting a different type of flour for more health benefits.<br>  <br>  2. Decide on a type of flour--Expand beyond whole wheat or regular white with rye or oat flour. Since these are used less, there are animals allergic to them. There are also lots of other flours you can try.<br>  <br>  3. Choose add-ins--nuts, cheese, p-nut butter, and more will make a treat your dog will be delighted to eat.<br>  <br>  4. Decide a shape, will you use cookiecutters to cut them in the shapes of squirrels or mail carriers? Or will you just spoon the dough onto the cookie sheet? After Lucy won't know.<br>  <br>  5. Bake<br>  <br>  6.Let cool. Max may be very interested in what comes out of the oven however make him wait until they won't burn his mouth.<br>  <br>  7. Store. The harder and more dried out they are, the longer they'll last. If you bake something with a lot of moisture--like a muffin or pupcake--you'll prolong their life by refrigerating them.<br>  <br>  <br>  In conclusion, there are many ways you can make homemade dog treats. You can bake for friends and wrap them up nicely as presents for your doggie pals. They're very appreciative and never say they're dieting and aren't eating cookies .<br>  <br>  Check out For More Details>><a href="http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c380_Dog-Food.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c3...</a>|`|Rgb3WkXVaa	Grapes are more poisonous to dogs than chocolate is!!!<br>  <br>  DO NOT GIVE YOUR DOG GRAPES OR CHOCOLATE!|`|96WEmtxfaa	Carrots and sausages are great, and any meat really xx|`|wGOtDZ0Uaa	all of my dogs adore raw carrots, good for their teeth  , reasonably<br>  priced and doesn't pile on the pounds.|`|V60ebzJzaa	My dog's favourite treat in the whole world is CHEESE!!!!|`|dAJiXPecaa	Hot dogs|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Raw carrots are good, you can also put peas (the frozen ones, thawed of course; canned peas have too much sodium added).

xNT856g9aa	hair loss on livestock is normal. lice would infect his spine like lice infect a persons nape. The hair loss is just because it is cold and maybe he is rubbing it down. Chances are the hair will re grow.<br>  consult a professional about it because many cattle get serious skin irritation which also causes them to lose their hair.
F3FrZ7eAaa	I think the answer here is go and see a vet! I don't really understand what you're saying considering your typing is quite distracting, but if he is vomiting "poop", I think you know what the answer is. Are the temperatures right in his tank? Maybe he was having a hard time digesting. Vomiting (reverse peristalsis) is quite stressful too. Make sure his cage requirements and met and you're feeding him a proper balanced diet.

UeWHGsqzaa	1. Do the math. Has she been in contact with an intact male in the past 30 days? Rabbit gestation period runs from 28-32 days with very little deviation from this range. If it’s been any longer than 40 days since the contact, you’re most likely in the clear. <br>  Step2. Examine her fur: especially under the chin. If her fur is loose, this could be a sign of pregnancy. A pregnant doe’s fur will pull away in clumps to use as nesting for the kits. <br>  Step3. Watch her behavior. A pregnant doe will often display repetitive behaviors, digging or chewing in an unusual place, or with increased tenacity. A better indication is “pulling”. A pregnant doe will “pull” fur; and she won’t necessarily start with her own! If she’s pulling thread from sweaters or stuffed toys, or even tugging fur from her mate, she could be signaling that she’s pregnant. She will stuff these materials in her mouth and place them where she intends to birth the kits. <br>  Step4  Feel her abdomen—but be careful! If you feel small, marble-like lumps, you’ve found the kits. Do not attempt this if you are new to breeding, as you could injure the kits. <br>  Step5. Visit your vet. Even if your vet is inexperienced with rabbits, she’ll be able to x-ray your doe and verify if she is pregnant.|`|hTi4MuKoaa	well I have much experience in this area, well if one of them is a male,<br>  the male will kill the babies  I know it unfortunate but that's just how it works. if you have a male and a female you will need to separate them<br>  or this will happen every month :(|`|q5viMBDPaa	First of all, she will whimper when you try to pick her up as they get protective.

FaPrr8bbaa	He might be sooooo smart that he is messing with you.  Does he seem smart enough to you to pull that off?  If not, did you use hand signals for each trick?  Did you give each trick its own hand signal?<br>  The pulling is easy, change direction when he gets ahead without warning him that you will turn.  He will figure out that he is going with you on your walk and this walk is not his.|`|NYzCYCmJaa	He is just a smart dog and is overthinking about the trick. My service dog does the samething. As for him pulling DON'T use a prong collar you jhave a pit it can make him aggressive it did to mine, I would use a gental leader or haltie. I wouldn't use a harness on him also because that will incourage him to pull harder.|`|RehgySLCaa	I had that problem with my dog. I would give him a command and he would quickly cycle through all his tricks hoping it would be the right one. What I do now is I hold the treat in front of him. I tell him the trick if he doesn't do the trick I asked I put the treat down and walk away. Now he has got them down straight again.|`|zxdEYy3Iaa	As for him backsliding, this can be for a number of reasons.  It may be possible that the training went too fast.  However, there are a number of possibilities here.  <br>  <br>  1.  TRAINING<br>  It is always best to start with positive reinforcers.  It will give him more reason to want to learn to do what you are telling him.  Start by keeping the tricks in the training sessions separate.  Don't mix them or add to them until you are sure he has gotten them down.  This is better done by splitting training sessions up throughout the day (such as sit in the morning, lay down mid-day, and so forth), so he doesn't forget one trick while learning another.  You may also find success in adding a hand signal or gesture to the command.  Eventually you can get him to do what you want with the simple snap of a finger/the appropriate hand gesture. <br>  <br>  Also, try to make sure you are being consistent in the tone and manner you say it.  They learn a lot from consistency in voice inflections.  For instance, if he is used to hearing "Sit, Buck" in a nice tone when you want him to sit, he might get a bit confused if you start simply saying "SIT!", especially  if it is in a much different tone, might throw him off or confuse him a bit. (This is another area where adding gestures/signals will help.  Give them something visual to associate the command with.)  As time goes by He will get better with understanding the commands no matter how you say them, but for training purposes, keep it consistent.<br>  <br>  2. OBEDIENCE<br>  Another common problem with dogs, especially PIT BULLS is dominance.  You may find that he is learning, he just isn't listening and the longer this goes on, the more of a problem it can become.  You must make sure he recognizes you as the ALPHA/HIS MASTER.  Most dogs will have a tendency to test you on this.  Again, you must be consistent.  I have found that though yelling and shouting may often be a good indicator to your dog that you are mad, without establishing your role as master, you won't get far.  If your dog tries to challenge one of the best ways to establish dominance is to roll him on his back, drop you arm across his chest, drop your weight on him, hold him down, and stare him in the eyes with a deep throaty growl.  This is how they establish dominance with one another so he will quickly get the point and understand you are over him.  Hold him for a minute or several, depending on how much you are trying to drive the point home. <br>  <br>  (Note: DO NOT go for the throat, or put your hands, arms, or face at his throat.  This may cause him to view you as more of a threat than a master.  In this instance, he won't trust you and that is not good.  <br>  <br>  Also, DO NOT put your face rigth in his when you are doing this as if he feels to threatened, depending on the dog, he might try to bite you.  Keep your weight on him and head back out of his reach but still stay over him and lock eyes with his.  Remember: he should be scared of you, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  Also, drop a lot of your weight on him but do not put ALL of your weight on him as you do not wish to hurt him, just enough to make it clear that you are bigger, stronger, and he's not going anywhere.  Use your judgment considering the size, weight, and strength of the dog.)<br>  <br>  ****<br>  <br>  As for teaching him to walk beside you/heel, start by walking him along a fence on a med.-short leash.  This will prevent him from being able to stray from side to side and keep him better focused on the lesson/developing the habit of staying by your side.  Keep in mind, if you are letting him run ahead of you and just trying to yank his leash to bring him back, he might have a problem even knowing what is pulling him.  Shortening the leash and adding clear vocal commands will help him associate any tugging with you/the commands and learn what you want him to do.  And of course, as with all training, be consistent!  ...And keep plenty of small treats in hand to reward him for being such a good pup.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and Good luck.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	He's probably confused.  He wants to please you, so he'll react to your commands, but he doesn't know which one you want.  Maybe you should concentrate on one at a time for a few days.  Gradually add new tricks back in as he gets better.  The best way to get the dog to walk beside you is to use a prong collar.  You have to use it correctly.  Pull upward when correcting, not backward.  Caesar Milan has some really good books and a tv show that can help with this.
TkJn9gO0aa	Yep, reptiles have a common opening called a cloaca. The cloaca allows excretion of liquids(kinda), defecation of solids, and even an opening for laying eggs and copulating.<br>  <br>  Snake's don't really pee in the form of liquid....which makes their feces look different. Their fecal matter usually consists of a bulbous hair-like clod help together with a resin and a small yellowish/white portion. The yellowish/white portion is actually uric acid in its solid form and is essentially "pee". Reptiles are great at preventing dessication(water loss) so they only use as little water as needed to expel the feces out of their body.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Yes, like the other two said. Right down near the tail is their "vent area". Unlike us though, both their pee and poop comes from the same place. Their poop looks weird at times too. There's either the dog looking kind, or this odd white bird poop. That's based on my Ball Python though.|`|vDTQSs23aa	About 2/3Rd's of their body they have a flap.

At the same time I can't see my life without having a dog around.<br>  The only time i would surrender them is if I didn't have a home or the money or the time to keep them.

Some of the tricks I will tell you won't be from the book, but you learn the behavior from the book.)<br>  <br>  The reward has to be something the cat likes, and will want again. You can make the reward different, it doesn't have to be the same thing. Always click while the cat is doing the motion.<br>  <br>  Before you do anything, you have to teach each cat what the clicker means. Do this one cat at a time.<br>  <br>  Take your clicker, and go into a quiet area with one of the kittens. Click! Treat (throw it on the ground in front of the kittens nose). Always click before treat. Do this until your kitten doesn't want to do it anymore, or you have done it about 10 times (which would be lucky). You want this to be fun.<br>  Next cat and repeat.<br>  <br>  Another useful (very useful) thing to teach your cat is to follow and touch a target.<br>  Put a spoon or your finger out in front of the kitten nose (about 10 inch. away).

Here is a link to his website: <a href="http://www.comedypet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.comedypet.com</a> he sells instructional DVDs.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you really need to observe what your cat naturally enjoys doing, then work off of that.  ie: If he's a jumper, then get him to go through hoops.  If he's a climber, then train him for a climbing trick.  Not all cats will cooperate with you on all tricks.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	no. you will soon learn you are their pet.<br>  <br>  it is a lot easier to observer their behavior, and if you see one you like, tell everybody you taught him to do that.<br>  <br>  if, for example, every time you whistle the cat jumps up and runs around the house, you just tell people that is how you trained her to get excersize.|`|ZttGhvMTaa	I trained my cats to sit and sit up and beg.

w9aR8ymGaa	Cats have a way of working things out.  I know it seems hopeless at the moment, but you may have to let them work through this one on their own.  Try spending time with them individually (in a different room from other cat) and get them to love you again, don't worry about them liking each other at this time.  <br>  <br>  Make sure there are two litter boxes and two places where they are being given food and water.  I have had cats that will only use the litter or eat/drink when furthest away from their nemesis and you don't want either of them to be hungry or potty elsewhere in your home.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zeTGmB3faa	Nothing, Just continue to talk to them and pet them as they let you. They will get over it. This is common, it's just their little attitude adjustment time.lol
MstjbpVJaa	Very often caged birds become obese,through lack of exercise,you could be feeding her too much millet try a little more canary seed.<br>  The loss of one feather even two would "Not" affect her flying,having bred birds for over 40 years ,even when a bird is moulting this does not happen!!!<br>  She is still feeding and whistling, so there may be nothing wrong,but what has been previously mentioned.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	You said she eats her millet? Is that the only thing she eats? Millet is a treat like cake or candy. So, if the bird eats A LOT of millet the bird is for sure overweight I would think.

KSmN2Vanaa	If the kitten is 2 weeks old, then the kitten is TOO YOUNG to be away from it's mother.  The kitten is probably trying to find a way to nurse.  You really need to return the kitten OR get the proper feeding formula and bottle feed this kitten. Ask your vet or at least go to a pet store and ask for info.<br>  <br>  I had a cat who was weaned too early and had a terrible habit of chewing on wool socks!  It practically ended a friendship when he chewed a perfect little hole in my friend's cashmere sock!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Are you saying you took a 2-week-old kitten away from its mother?!?! No wonder its still trying to nurse!<br>  <br>  <br>  How long should kittens stay with their mother?<br>  A kitten should stay with its mother for an absolute minimum of ten weeks and preferably twelve. Although they may be "weaned" prior to eight weeks, they will still have the occasional need to nurse. Kittens taken from their mom cats before this time often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood.<br>  They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats. The time they spend with their mother and siblings is very important. Try to imagine how a human would be affected if you took him away from his parents at a very young age, and he didn’t have the proper role model to learn from. Often kittens that are separated from their mother too soon, have problems learning to use the litter box, or will be very withdrawn and shy, and/or have social problems with other animals as well as humans.|`|005a61bba8d9b8803905cdfa72e2bd86aa	Do you mean that you've had the kitten for 2 weeks, or she's 2 weeks old? If she's only 2 weeks old, she's too young to be away from her mother. She's probably sucking on the fur because she needs to nurse. If you rescued her, talk to a vet about how to feed her properly. This is very important; she can (and probably will) die if not cared for properly.<br>  <br>  If she is AT LEAST six weeks old, then this is normal behavior. My cat sucks on things that have a texture she enjoys - it's substitute nursing behavior and it means she is content.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Why and how do you have a two week old kitten?!

zqVDJxUIaa	No. Tiger Barbs are infamous for their fin-nipping of peaceful community fish, such as mollies. Tiger Barbs will almost always chase and attack peaceful fish, unless you keep a large number of the Tigers. Keeping a large number will reduce aggression, because they will pick on their own species rather than other fish. If you are very keen on keeping the two, then you would need a large tank, and you would need at least 10 or more Tiger Barbs, and very dense plants. However, I still wouldn't recommend keeping mollies with Barbs. If you really want to keep Barbs, especially Tigers, a good companion would be the attractive Clown Loach. These Loaches get along very well with barbs, and will actually swim with them! If you want to keep mollies, then you should consider getting some other peaceful fish, such as Platys, Guppies, Zebra Danios, Corydoras Catfish, or any other peaceful freshwater species. For more info on compatible fish, check out the links below.<br>  Tiger Barbs:<a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/barbs/tigerbarb.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/barbs/ti...</a><br>  Clown Loach:<a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/mix/clownloach.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/mix/clow...</a><br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Mollies:<a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/livebearer/molly.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/livebear...</a><br>  Zebra Danio:<a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/fish/zebradanio.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/fish/zeb...</a><br>  Platy:<a href="http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/livebearer/platy.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/livebear...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|D178335Paa	yes because they are community fish. remember though the barbs are semi agressive so it depends on how big they are and how they react to other fish|`|P9RQ4mgiaa	I have 1 tiger barb and 2 green tiger barbs in a tank with my 2 mollies. They get along fine!|`|e63c982cd1dd110a427b5227d3f1e465aa	I wouldn't put them in the same tank unless you have a large aquarium over 50 gallons so that the mollys will have plenty of room to avoid the barbs and then I would still only put one or two barbs. Normally barbs only like long finned fish because they are semi-agressive fish and they will have a tendency to snip at the fins. I have seen them chase at other fish when kept in close quarters with each other. <br>  <br>  Also, another thing to consider when getting mollys they have a lot of babies!  Make sure if you get them and you do not want a population control issue only get males.|`|sNSfxZSTaa	If your talking about Tiger Barbs, Etc... Than no. Mollies are a pretty peaceful fish. Tiger Barbs like to nip at fins. Its possible you could get lucky and they would get along but chances are no.<br>  <br>  If your talking about Cherry Barbs... than yes. <br>  <br>  It really depends on what kind of barbs your looking at. The people at the store where you will be purchasing the fish should be able to help you out.|`|0u3dKXhQaa	cherry barbs and gold barbs will get along fine with mollies but not tiger barbs  danio`s go well with mollies in groups of 6 hope this helps good luck
hY2uqgR2aa	1 inch per gallon is actually a pretty good rule, all things considered.  That number depends on a variety of factors, like aeration, filtration, the presence of nitrifying bacteria in the tank, etc.  Under ideal conditions, a tank can support much more than 1 inch of fish per gallon, but no tank has ideal conditions.<br>  <br>  You should be fine with that mix, so long as you have plenty of plants and hiding places for your fish.  But (and this is something that most people don't realize), corydoras (catfish) and otocinclus are schooling fish.  I would get three of each.  You don't have to worry about the catfish getting too big so long as you don't get a plecostomus.<br>  <br>  One more thing: adding all those fish at once would be a very bad idea.  I would start with either the corys or otos, and add one type of fish per week.  Every additional fish you add contributes to the bioload, and adding too many fish at once doesn't allow your little ecosystem to balance itself out.  That's the single biggest mistake most fishkeepers make.<br>  <br>  OK, this really is the last: is this a brand new tank?  Or does it already have fish in it?  If this is a new tank, please, PLEASE, educate yourself on the Nitrogen Cycle and make sure you cycle your tank before adding any fish.  There's lots of good articles out there that tell how to do it.  It takes patience, but it's absolutely essential.  Yahoo! Search is your friend...|`|0u3dKXhQaa	here goes lol<br>  gourami,6 cardinal tetra`s, will be fine <br>  glow light tetra`s prefer to be in groups of 6 or more<br>  catfish i wouldn`t get as it will grow too big i would go for a loach eg zebra loach <br>  the dwarf sucking catfish(otocinclus) will be fine too<br>  i would be care full in getting the long finned ram due to the lyre tail may nip at it  hope i have helped good luck on your choice
A8g8rsiraa	we have LOADS of dogs and they all get along well together, altho we do have kennels etc. becuase we breed them. but basically what you are saying is fine, it would be really good for them really because its like having a twin sibling so they will fight etc. but they will also absolutely adore each other. when the new pup comes the older pup will be a bit off with them and possibly be slightly over-dominant but because they will still be quite young this will be able to be trained out of this relatively easily.<br>  the only slight problem is that you will need to make sure you correctly train them both without either of them disrupting the others training, possibly do it in different rooms etc. but you will need to treat them the same because they will be so near in age as in to feed them at the same time etc.|`|AA12128656	yeah. 2 pups are harder to train.<br>  <br>  and what planet are you from, getting a 4 week old pup? i SERIOUSLY DOUBT that a vet ok'd it... because 4 weeks is NOT OK to be away from its mother and littermates. must wait till at LEAST 8 WEEKS OLD! that's LAW, and common sense!<br>  <br>  whoever sold you a 4 week old pup should be REPORTED to the police, it's a CRIME! they're obviously crappy BYB's who don't know their dog facts! <br>  <br>  don't get another dog- you haven't yet learned how to choose a good breeder.|`|SnAsZapMaa	(1) I tell people that if they can cope with only 2 dogs then they should be half-a-life-expectancy apart. That way the pup has an already-trained pooch to mimic, and when the elder dies you have a loving pet right there to offer fur therapy. A GSD living 10-15 years, there should be 5-7 years between the two pooches.<br>  (2) Have you looked up the genetics of kidney diseases? If not, search in <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_GSD_Source/links/Diseases_001198817153/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...</a> You don't say what relationship the litter has to your dead pup. I would be loathe to accept a replacement pup from EITHER parent. I would decline a pup that has BOTH the parents that produced your kidney failure pup.<br>  (3) The age gap is unfortunate. It means that the present pup will be at the rough-n-tough hooligan age while the younger will be too small to defend itself.<br>  (4) As others have said, it is mighty hard to train 2 pups at once,  unless each pup has its own pet human who is totally responsible for training THAT pup but not the other. We used to quite often keep 2 pups from a litter, with one bonding to me, the other  bonding to my wife. Being siblings, they were at the same physical stage when playing and had sorted out their dominance order while still nestlings, so rough play was not a problem.<br>  <br>  Overall:<br>  It COULD work out okay, but all the factors are against it, in my book. If you go ahead, build them side-by-side runs & sleeping boxes so that the submissive one gets some peace & quiet, and so that they can be separated when the fighting starts (which, if both are of the same sex, is most likely at 10 months old and almost certain just before 3 months old, unless you fluke that the rescued pup is a natural alpha and the GSD a natural gamma).<br>  <br>  Your rescued pup:<br>  I am concerned about all these visiting dogs. A pup at that age has effectively no resistance to parvovirus, and probably not to distemper, either. But the older pups can bring the virus in on their coats/paws, without themselves being affected. I recommend to my buyers that their pup NOT leave their property before 10 weeks old (I get the vet to visit me, or to check the pups in the back of my ute so that the litter doesn't have to enter the clinic), and from then until 2 weeks after the 4 months booster shot I recommend that the pup's socialisation/familiarisation be ONLY in places where dogs do not piddle/poo/vomit. Unfortunately that socialisation HAS to be almost complete by 12 weeks of age, but biology IS a worry.<br>  Les P<br>  owner of GSD_Friendly:  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_Friendly">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/GSD_F...</a><br>  "In GSDs" as of 1967|`|NYzCYCmJaa	Having two dog is fine I have had up to 4 at one time.

That is not usually old enough. I have 2 dogs, always have had more than one. With 2 puppies though, will someone be home all day to deal with potty training?  As young as they will both be, they will have to go out frequently. <br>     My dogs have always been each others best friends. I have about 7 acres which gives them plenty of exercise space. You'll have your hands full, but they will grow up together. Just imaging having twin boys...double trouble!|`|b015RuNFaa	I think the dogs would be just fine growing up together.  In some ways, it will probably make things easier on you, since they'll have each other to play with and can learn from each other.  It might especially help your current puppy, because four weeks is extremely young to take a pup, even if he was weaned.  There's critical socialization with the rest of the litter that goes on for several weeks that he's missed out on, so I'm not sure if getting another puppy two months down the road would actually be too late to socialize in this way or not, but I would think that it couldn't hurt.  But I guess the bigger question is, can you handle two growing, rambunctious puppies at the same time?
SOxdyWQOaa	what?? details please|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Use the details. They are there so you dont confuse people. And Ive been confused.
KEYgd73saa	Please define "fine".  Unless your parameters read out ammonia: 0 ppm, nitrite: 0 ppm, nitrate: <20 ppm, your readings are not fine.  There is a good chance there is something wrong with the water quality, but regardless, water changes won't hurt.  There is also a chance that it is getting picked at, particularly by the Puffers, who have a reputation for aggression.  Lastly, it could be getting chased by either of your insufficient schools: the Rainbows and Scissortails.  Both are schooling fish, and without that school, will often resort to nipping, chasing, and other belligerence towards other fish-- something docile Gouramis won't take a liking to.|`|YXJWN2luaa	i agree with soop. he soundd like he is stressed. either from water quality or its tank mates. 20ltr. doesnt seem big enough for the fish that i have. all of them swim in the same area of the tank and ur gourami os singled out. pushing the gourami to the bottom cuz there is no other place for him. good luck

AA11650764	Definitely try to get as much of the discharge out of the eye as possible. As the previous suggestion said, use a warm wet paper towel or cotton to rub the eye gently. If the discharge continues to irritate her, use eye drops and try to rinse out the infection that way. Try to keep her from rubbing her eyes with her paws, or wash her paws frequently. If the irritation is not too bad, she should be alright until tomorrow.

The warm wetness will help break up any puss or liquid that is coming out of it and will be soothing to the little thing until you can get to the vet. If you have any powdered boric acid, you could put a tiny amount in a cup of very warm, almost hot water and wipe the eye with this solution.
45N6tmWraa	Probably they are just as effective, if you're using a major brand like Norden.  Many veterinarians who have an established relationship with a client will even dispense vaccine for home administration.  You do need to be reasonably certain that the vaccine has been handled appropriately, kept refrigerated, not frozen, etc.  It's a sure bet that the ones left in the sun on the dash of the truck will NOT work well. And you must give it with the right-sized needle, by the correct route, subcutaneous or intramuscular, as the manufacturer recommends.|`|Nuh3T1cDaa	I buy my vacs from my vet and give them myself.  If I called him out to do it he'd have a fit!  He's much too busy to do routine things for people who can do for themselves.  <br>  I do prefer to buy from my vet because I know the meds were kept properly and I give the bit of profit to someone I know and respect.
AA11992723	no way to say for sure since he's a mix, but I would guess around 35 lbs but border collies can weigh 35-45 lbs..some weigh up to 60lbs. aussies have a tendency to put on too much weight.<br>  <br>  before you get a herding dog, you should read alot about the breeds. they are not like other dogs and will develop fear, neurotic, destructive and/or aggressive issues if their physical and mental stimulation needs aren't met every day..you cant just take this dog out for a walk, even for an hour, and expect that to be good enough, not with border collies and Australian shepherds. but if your kids and you devote time to giving the dog a "job" each day (can be anything from catching a frisbee to going on errands in the car with you) this dog should be ok. they need kind leadership, they are very sensitive, and will shut down with harsh training/treatment.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	60 lbs absolute tops|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	are you refering to a border collie, austrailian sheherd mix?

My guess is it will be medium breed size.<br>  <br>  I've always heard to look at a pups paws that will give you an idea.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Both these breeds are 40-60 lbs you can expect it to be in that range.
EeJMITyCaa	Yes crate training does work. You should've been crating her when you can't watch her. Also, your dog hasn't learned that it is wrong to poo inside. THe dog has associated poo with spanking. So, she isn't thinking "I'm going to get a spanking because I pooed on the floor again". She is pooing and then she is thinking "Darn, there is my poo on the ground; she hits me when ever she sees my poo". Hitting your dog can work but it is random. Your dog has to make the association that she will get hit if she poos in the house. Your dog doesn't seem to be able to make that connection. So, if I were you I'd stop it.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Crate training is best for housebreaking dogs - when you can't be with them, put them in a crate.  They don't go where they sleep.  But you have to take her out very frequently.  Every time you take her out of the crate, early in the morning, after every meal, and no less than every 2 hours.  Also, check with the vet to make sure she's not ill.<br>  By the way - negative training doesn't work.  Hitting and putting her nose in it will just confuse you.  She knows you're angry, so she hides, but that doesn't mean she understands.  Buy a training book, it will really help you.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	she cowers and hides because you have abused her ( spanking, rubbing face in urine  etc)  doing that to a dog will always have negative results- dogs do not know what that means..<br>  <br>  <br>  have you tried crate training her for housebreaking purposes|`|PDb03NvKaa	What we did in my family, is we got a little bell that we put by the door. Frequently, we'd take her out, but first, gently take her paw and tap the bell so that it made the noise. then we'd say: "let's go potty" and take her out. if she went in the house, we told her no, and tied her up for a short while. now whenever Khaki needs out, she rings the bell.|`|SwyZkNn6aa	Ok.<br>  <br>  You're doing some things right and other things wrong.  Shoving their nose in the pee is WRONG WRONG WRONG.  You have to catch her in the act.  Their memory is only about 2 minutes or something like that so they won't look at the pee and say, "Oh, gee I shouldn't have done that in the house" lol.  So, when you catch her, clap your hands to startle her (usually stops them), say NO in a deep, stern voice and rush her outside.  <br>  <br>  Do you crate train?  Crate training was so instrumental in helping us house break our dog.  Not only that but it kept her from destroying our house when we weren't around!  She learned that she goes outside to pee, because she went directly from the crate (they don't usually pee or poop in their own personal space) to the backyard and didn't have a chance to pee in the house after being in the crate at night or when we left the house for a period of time.  Now she can go all day with us at work and doesn't have to be left in the crate anymore.  She's only 8 mos old!<br>  <br>  How often do you let your dog out?  Does she get walked regularly? 30-40 minutes a day is ideal. <br>  <br>  Also, please don't spank your dog.  Spanking is so unnecessary and ineffective when you learn the right way to train your dog.  And it's just plain mean.  Positive reinforcement really is the best way (praising her when she pees or poops outside with a treat).<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I know how frustrating it can be to have pee in your house!|`|n5URUEqXaa	Take your puppy out ever 20 minutes during the day. And do not let her in until she either pees or poops. Make sure she has no water or dinner within an hour of "bedtime". At night put her to bed as late as you can and wake her up as early as you can. It is annoying but it will work. And if she does potty indoors, put her in a dog cage and leave her there until it is time for her to go outside. And when she goes outside, get really excited and find out what her favorite treat is (my dog's favorite are carrots).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Scolding her after she has done the deed is a waste of time. Putting her nose in it and spanking her is simply cruel. (Would you do that to a young child?) <br>     You need to train yourself to know her signs. I have a 7 mo old rescue. I know to take her out right after she wakes from a nap. I crate trained her and will put her into her 'cave' if I have to be out for an hour or longer or if I'm involved in a project that would prevent me from getting her out quickly. She will not potty where she sleeps. Fear from scolding is a negative training method. Dogs respond to praise not punishment. <br>     Spend the time with her. Just like children, not all dogs are the same. They learn at different rates. The very fact that you say that she goes to the door and cries indicates that she knows what she needs to do. It's not her fault if you ignore her signs.
ZkYxdlTeaa	It's a West Highland White Terrier|`|KvUJZa1Paa	West Highland White Terrier<br>  <br>  why does this question need to be ask 10 times a day?|`|pYF9KnNeaa	That little cutie is a West Highland Terrier.
IMPvzBk1aa	Two things to look at are what he is eating and how much exercise is he getting?<br>  If he is spending much time standing in a stall, then he will have excess energy to burn.  The more time he can spend out moving around, the less energy he will have to act up when you ride.<br>  <br>  If you are feeding a high energy feed, like sweet feed, I would gradually eliminate it from the diet.  Good grass hay can be supplemented with beet pulp for calories without the carbohydrate overload that cereal grains produce.  Reducing protein is not the answer to this.  It is excess grain starch that releases simple sugars into the blood and causes hormone mania.  Then, any remaining undigested grain starch is passed to the hind gut where it wreaks havoc with the gut bacteria and produces metabolic acidosis, also contributing to the "high" and hot behavior.<br>  <br>  Beet pulp is a digestible fiber that ferments in the hind gut and enters the blood without creating a hormone upheaval.<br>  <br>  The rest of it is a training issue, and whenever I read that anyone has gone to a harsher bit for an out of control horse, I tell them what I'm telling you.  Horses should be controlled with body cues.....you ride the body, and not the mouth. <br>  It sounds like your horse needs to be trained to stop and slow down when you cue him with your seat, weight, and legs.  <br>  I would start by looking at his diet and turnout, and then work on more training.  I hope this helps.|`|Ih0B30Pvaa	well, sounds like you have a happy healthy horse!  the only problem is that he can be dangerous around people.  take him off (slowly) any type of sweat feed, and cut back his grain.  exercise him before you ride all of the time.  also, if you leave him out in the pasture he can get some of his energy out on his own. you don't want to put him on any calming herbs just yet.  try rationing his feed and routine exercise.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Feed and excercise have a LOT to do with energy and your appy sounds like he's full of it.  You may want to work him on a lunge line BEFORE you ride and once he's quieted down then put him to work with you on his back.<br>  <br>  What are you currently feeding him grain and hay wise.  Anything with an oat content is going to increase his energy level.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	if he gets a whole scoop of grain, lower it down to 1/2 or even lower.<br>  check that when you ride your saddle isn't too small that it's pinching his back, or that it's too wide and is slipping. he might be bored and wants a friend if he paces, so it would be a good idea considering getting a mini, goat, sheep, or even another horse! if you lived alone with no friends, you would get very bored and probably cranky.<br>  hope i helped!|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Are you feeding him sweet feed? is it 14%? I think if you lower the protein he will calm down. At least that is what I have been told.<br>  Also- run him before you ride and let him get some energy out.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	What are you feeding him?  That can affect his behavior.|`|Atd7Buo1aa	well, you could lung him before you ride, just canter/lope around a good 10 times around each direction, <br>  i ride in a bit call the Segunda, and it did pretty well! very controling as long as you know how to use it, and all the simple thing like talk to your horse, saying "woah" and "easy boy" and congrdulationg him rubbing his withers(:<br>  good luck with him! hope something helps.|`|eq9kJZ4Uaa	he probably is getting too much grain and not enough exercise.  Appaloosas generally do not need more than a handful of grain depending on what you are doing with them. he may also need longer turnout until he calms down.|`|6jg5vMakaa	Wet saddle blankets do wonders for horses with a lot of energy.|`|Befahnttaa	You should try to lunge your horse and see if that helps but it could also be the horses feed. Hope I helped|`|Kw8eP9fSaa	Since you said that he doesn't pin his ears or buck in an aggressive way, i doubt that your problem is in the tack. Do you lunge him? if not, its a great start. saddle him and put him on a lunge line (normally about 27 feet) and take him into your arena or wherever you work him. send him away from you using aggressive body language and assure him that you're in charge. work him  on the lunge line until you can see him quieting down. his body language will relax and he will start to drop his head. make sure and work him both ways and by the time you get in, he will be much better. also, when you first get on, loosen up his muscles by working in circles and off of your legs.<br>  good luck and happy riding!!!!!<br>  <br>  PS- appys are known for having incredible stamina and endurance. aka: the energizer bunny horses! this is part of the breed and the lunging will really help calm him and get him focused
EeJMITyCaa	I don't think you should try it. I know a breeder who had a Chihuahua's puppies die when she breed them to a Chihuahua; I really doubt that a chihuahua could have cocker spaniel puppies. Cocker spaniel puppies are about as large a Chihuahua anyway. You should take her to the vet and get the pups aborted.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	She should not be allowed to have these pups.  They will grow so big inside her that it could kill her before the pups would be born.<br>  <br>  She needs to get a spay/abortion as soon as you can possibly do it, like yesterday.  The sooner the better.<br>  <br>  I get all my pets fixed at the age of 4 months.  Just so this does not happen.  I rescue dogs & I can't afford to have a fertile dog at all.<br>  <br>  Please, spay & neuter your pets.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	best thing for all concerned would be a spay/abort   NOW|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	when did she tie! If it is 2 days ago she can have an injection to stop anything thing happening and again 2 days after that.<br>  Go to your vet straight away, because if you let her carry on with the pregnancy she will die. She is to small and the dad is far to big. If you breed a chi with a chi you can still loss the chi, because they are not very good whelpers and mums and pups dont make it.<br>  <br>  You should never breed a chi under 5 lb which it looks your little girl is under that. Chihuahuas are so hard to breed and so many die because there owners dont have a clue. If the stud chi is big (your stud certainly was) then it will make the pups bigger which then means she wont be able to push them out and will need a c-section costing around ￡500. Again sometimes the chi mum doesnt make it through the operation. This is why you need to see your vet straight away and then get her done , this will prevent this from happening again. Better to get her done than him, because if he is done, she will have her season and they will still tie for 20 minutes or so.<br>  <br>  I have many chihuahuas for a lot of years, they are great little dog but terrible to breed from. Be prepared some nasty answers on here!  All the best Maria|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	no, she can not safely carry and deliver. Chihuahuas often need c-sections anyways and that is IF she can even carry them. That person up there that said nature makes the puppies small has no idea what they are talking about. If the sire is too big and the pups are big then they can grow so big that they can rupture her uterus and kill her. Chihuahuas can be up to 8 pounds (smaller than my cat) and Cockers can get up to 40 pounds. There is no way you should risk her life for this. Please have her to the vet immediately and have her spayed. She will be so much healthier! Honestly, are you willing to risk her life? Because that is what you're doing. Emergency c-sections are very expensive and if you don't get her to the vet in time then she will die. Better for all concerned for her to get spayed now.|`|xEyyFrPhaa	it isn't safe for her to have those puppies as the cocker spaniel is bigger than the chihuahua and it would kill her take her to the vets and explain, and make a appointment to have her spayed asap so it can't happen again.|`|L22hVXTIaa	If she's not too far along (within the first 30 days), I would DEFINITELY have her spayed.  Yes, the puppies can be aborted which is sad, but it's better than putting your dog's life in jeopardy by letting her try to deliver these puppies.  If she mated with a Cocker, she will almost certainly have to have a C-section.  Chihuahuas especially, are notorious for needing C-sections even when bred with other Chihuahuas! <br>  <br>  If you love your dog, take her to the vet to see if the puppies can be aborted and her spayed today!|`|vwC7klVVaa	I would get your vet to give her a scan and keep a close eye on her also be prepared that she may need a  c section as the puppies might be to big for her to give birth to natural.

Best bet is the vet and spay.|`|S5Lz35myaa	I would say no - she is too small.<br>  Take her to a vet and spay and abort the puppies now, before they develop any larger.  By not doing this, you are putting your own dog at serious risk.|`|KuUx34hCaa	probably not  the cocker is way to big & I can NOT hardly believe  that he did NOT tear her apart  & this is a excellent reason to have dogs fixed you might seriously think about aborting them & having her spayed at the same time NOW|`|wGOtDZ0Uaa	as chihuahua's can have trouble having pup's anyway it may be a <br>  plan to get your vet's advice as soon as. If it was my dog I would be<br>  beside myself with worry.|`|0CWWfgMdaa	I don't know man, this does not sound like a great idea. <br>  if she is a pure bred Chi then forget it, way too tiny, if she is a two part breed ( eg : Jack russel mixed with Chihuahua and has a little size on her , get a vet's opinion.<br>  granted, if she makes it to the giving birth stage there is no way she can carry more than one, it'll kill her for sure. don't rely on c section....looks like you need to get her aborted . <br>  That said, the puppies will be a mixture and not as large as pure bred spaniels...opf course we don't know HOW small. <br>  look after her #1 she can have more puppie later that won't hurt her .|`|AA11650764	Take her to a vet for delivery as they have probably handled cases like this before. If you're worried about the pain, you can have her sedated and ask them to preform a c-section. After the delivery, you should have her spayed! Best of luck to your dog and the puppies!!|`|JPa0GzDjaa	You could try and take the chihuahua to the vet and explain the circumstances. They might suggest a scan to see and give you the possible options. I don't think the female would be able to handle having such a big puppy when they struggle as they are.|`|WQlCxeFlaa	You may have to abort the puppies. My friend's Pug was pregnant by a pitbull (dont ask...it was funny though) and we had to abort the puppies cuz the Vet said she could "explode" from their size... Talk to your vet first...|`|qapJU3tMaa	Take her to the vet's and have her aborted and spayed.  Yes, having pups by a larger dog will KILL her.  Why did you allow this to happen?|`|NWTfFEuVaa	You can take her to a vet and have a C-Section because I don't think she'd make it.
RFM2Cb1Zaa	It depends on what the pony is like and can do, or how much the owner wishes you to pay - such as if they keep the horse at their own yard there wouldnt be livery fee's etc. <br>  I payed 86 pounds (dont have pounds sign on computer :] ) for a full loan but it was more go over whenever you like sorrt of thing and the owner wasnt bothered. It ranges from about 80 up to 300 in England per month for your average pony. Like if you move yards it could be just all the fees added together like livery, farrier, vaccinations, feed and worming or added equipment or shows. Hope this helped :)|`|aW4fztiHaa	well typically you pay all of your board and training as well as half the cost to buy the pony each year. This fee is paid on a monthly basis. In my area board and training combined is about $1000 each month and the average price per pony is from $12000-$50000. So if the pony costs about 12k then you would be paying 1500 each month. (this included board, training, and the lease fee)|`|4AAtLhuraa	Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|uec7RIhbaa	personally i simply wouldn't.  i would expect to pay (as you have said) for all the horses requirements (although things like vet's bills may be covered through owners iunsurance and loaners only pay the excess) including farrier, feed, board etc.  I would not accept a loan agreement requiring me to fork out further money for a horse that wasn't legally my own - and i don't think you should do that either.  there are simply loads of good horses out there for loan without you haveing to pay "rent" for them as well as their bills!!!|`|zMXDolD9aa	This may or may not be helpful but i used to PART loan a 14.3hh cob, and i paid ￡20 per week. I rode him twice, plus all stable chores.<br>  If he was on full livery then it could be anywhere from around ￡50 a week, at LEAST, but probably much more.
HDz8fAfIaa	No, nonononono, that would probably harm your rat, and there are things sold at pet stores / vets that help with odor. I have a rabbit, and i bought<br>  <br>  "Bi-Odor - Internal Waste & Urine Deodorizer" For Rabbits, Guinea Pigs, & All Small Animals - Deodorizes pet's stool, urine and body orders internally by simply adding to pet's water daily.<br>  <br>  Therefore, you should get something similar if you are bothered by the scent of your rats urine.

LJwhaNIDaa	No birds sleep on perches as a way to avoid predators. It is healthy for them to have several perches in their cage. <br>  <br>  They only sit on the nest to keep their eggs warm. <br>  <br>  They may occasionally sit on the floor of the cage, though.

If you are going to do something that stupid you might as well make a bonfire in your office.|`|RmZbkrmMaa	staples + paper clips wouldn't really be a good idea.. I used to have a rat, she had paper for bedding + sometimes chewed it but she had rat food too. Ask in a pet shop I guess!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Can you?|`|q5viMBDPaa	Ive had rats in the past, they had paper as bedding they chewed on it but never ate it. There isn't a hope in hell that they will eat all your paper, my advice would be to get a recycling contract & tell the shredding company they are idiots!
gAJHfQGaaa	One inch of fish per gallon of water for fresh water tanks. So no more than 15 inch mollies. Then again they may grow large than an  inch. Not more than 1.5 inches though. Be safe and stick with 10. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|tShDXmgbaa	I have 10 in my 10 gallon. I dont go by the "rule of thumb" Last time I did....my tanked looked very empty and pathetic.|`|AA11922229	The answer is dependent on the total system not the gallons. Is the filtration proper and over designed, it should be both.<br>  <br>  Is there lots of aeration?<br>  Is there a bottom filter?<br>  Is there a carbon activated filter, outside the tank?<br>  The food is also important. Use brand name flakes for tropical fish.<br>  The aquarium water should be circulating through the gravel downward to the space below the bottom rack holding the gravel, and out the tubes which are driven by air bubbles.<br>  <br>  Begin with  6 fish in a new tank and gradually increase to about 1 fish per gallon, for mollies. Larger fish need more volume so you would need to limit the population.<br>  Don't use tap water in aquariums. The chemicals burn the fish's gills.<br>  Well aerated tanks may sustain a population, but the chemistry of the water changes over time, building up ammonia. To counter this be sure to change the water out every few months. An aquarium with less fish reach a sustainable balance requiring much less maintenance.<br>  Limit the food. Give them just enough to survive. They should finish the food within 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  Keep other species too. Bottom feeders keep a tank clean, and wash the gravel. I like catfish, and algae eaters.<br>  <br>  A new tank needs to be broke in like a pair of shoes. Otherwise you may find dead fish. I use gold fish for the first month. Then I add a heater, remove the gold fish, and let the tank settle for a few days then add the tropical fish.<br>  <br>  The gravel thickness for a 15 gallon should be at least 1 inch spread uniformly. Add some structure in the tank too. Fish like to hide and find niches.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|1lELTHwraa	The rule of thumb is an inch of fish per gallon.  So I would say since a Molly is about an inch and a quarter to and inch and a half you can safely have 8 mollies in a 15 gallon tank.|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	None.<br>  <br>  yes the Rule of thumb is 1 inch per fish.<br>  But moles need more space than a 15 will let them have.<br>  <br>  I recommend a 20+ for mollies and a nice current.|`|nCMUA50Raa	it depends on if they are strawberry mollies or not. they have more mdma in them than most extacy pills ;)|`|V48r9YKFaa	If I remember correctly the rule of thumb is one inch of fish per gallon of water|`|FvRl3amaaa	you can have about 15 but u should get less just in case of them having babies
px27V5N9aa	I like a lightly sandy area.  Not deep. <br>  <br>  Here is a great website for many areas of barn/arena/fencing.<br>  I love it!<br>  <a href="http://www.myhorse.com/barn/arenas/horse_arena_footing.aspx#top" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhorse.com/barn/arenas/horse...</a><br>  <br>  Some of what they state:<br>  "Basically, you want a surface that makes it easy for your horse to do his job, whatever that happens to be. He should be confident that his footing is even and consistent — no dips, holes, sudden shifts in texture or “give” to distract him or make him wary or reluctant to move out or meet fences.  The footing should offer enough resistance to allow him to push off without sinking too deeply, yet it should help absorb some of the concussion when his feet hit the ground.<br>  <br>  If he needs traction for tight maneuvers, the footing shouldn’t shift out from under him. If he needs to slide, the footing shouldn’t be too thin or compacted."|`|Ih0B30Pvaa	sand is hard to ride in.  dirt is just fine for an outdoor arena.  if you have to get sand get the finest sand you can find and it will mix in with the dirt.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Sand would be the best..price depends on where you live..call the local Quarry, they will have best prices. It will take approx 4 dumps for 100 x 200 foot arena.  Don't mix with the dirt, it will mix on its own.  If you mix it, it will get hard and not drain in a good rain.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	Hi,<br>  I was wondering if you can just leave it as grass....<br>  <br>  and yeah sand is a pretty good thing to use. its easy on the joints and strenthens a horse also.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
F3FrZ7eAaa	I like fire belly newts, I've had them before. You can have a few of them even if the tank is the right size, and they don't need too huge of a house. What about crabs? Like hermit crabs are pretty cool, and again you can always get a few of them. I've never had them, but people say they are fun to watch.|`|vD5ucs24aa	Frogs need live food. They need to see it moving.|`|cwKLCFNdaa	hermit crabs are fun i have had one and they are very intresting i fyour looking for something that is easy to take care of and isnt to expensive i would get a hermit crab
hetZz4c1aa	All cats are curious and your house is fair game for their interest.  I would be very careful approaching feral cats with your children, they have little or no experience interacting with people.  A gentle pat can cause them to lash out from fear.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|4TX26viFaa	I'd put out a bowl of fresh water and dry food for them, even ferals need to have a reliable food source to stay healthy.  You can contact your local shelter and see if they do free TNR, and get the cats fixed that way.  Our shelter does it for free, the cats are neutered/spayed, microchipped, de-wormed, de-flead, vaccinated and ear tipped.  They won't make more kittens this way.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	They are just looking for a little free food. Some houses feed their pets outside. If you want to, just buy a bag of dry food and leave some out by the deck window and you can watch them come up and eat.Some are friendly after a few weeks and you might even be able to pet them. I did this with a big stray a while back. He moved on though. You might get Raccoons or Opossums too depending on where you live.DO NOT mess with them though, they can be vicious.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	They're probably looking for food.  Im just giving you fair warning, if you feed them, they'll never leave.  If you dont want them coming around then absolutely do not feed them.  If you dont mind that they hang out, then feed them (it would be nice of you).|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	Well you can always leave some food out and try to earn their trust.|`|gdxkIGhGaa	Just leave two or more bowls of cat food outside, next to the forest, they might leave.|`|Yz981zO6aa	The cats are probably feral (wild) and would be best left alone or captured by your local animal authorities. Most likely they are looking for food, but don't feed them unless you want them to keep coming around. The sad part is that these cats were probably tame animals that were abandoned and they have reverted to a feral state.They will continue to breed, unchecked and increase their population. They are subject to all kinds of diseases, including rabies, so you and your children should be very careful around them. And...a pox upon the people who abandoned them in the first place!!|`|wAkF8Vuraa	the reason they peek through your window is that they are either hungry or want a warm place to stay. There is nothing wrong with having a stray cat. I think it is wonderful and will be with you and your kids at all times and will also love to play. My uncle had a place for stray cat and food everyday for them.|`|DroSlNqoaa	If you are an animal lover,go on...give it someting to eat in your presense.It will gradually become accustomed to coming to you and will soon become friendly.<br>  Cats can become friendly very easily.It all depends on how you talk to them or treat them.<br>  All the best.|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	they are looking to see if anyones home, so they can come in to steal food.<br>  <br>  stray cats are hard to train, but you can interact with them by leaving out some food and water, and watching them|`|xBleAz7oaa	Yup, I'd **** um too
32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	"What can be done?"<br>  <br>  quite simply, nothing<br>  <br>  this is very common, more common than most people would ever realize|`|AA12128656	the probable reason that their other dogs "turned mean" or bit was because they were chained up all the time.<br>  <br>  it's ok to have a dog go on a runner for some time during the day to enjoy the sun and get some exercise (i have a lab who prefers it to the fenced area- he likes watching people on the sidewalk) but that should only be for a little bit, like an hour or two a day. a few hours max.<br>  <br>  dogs who are chained frequently suffer from anxiety and aggression problems, and tend to be very territorial.  dogs who live in the house with their families are much more well adjusted for the most part, and learn proper dog manners, that an outside dog wouldn't learn.<br>  <br>  also, an 8 week old pup shouldn't be kept outside, no matter what the weather! that is like taking a 2 year old baby, putting it in a crib, and only visiting it to feed or clean it. it's neglect.<br>  <br>  explain to them (if you can) how chaining a dog and leaving them out there, with no company or pack makes them more likely to bite. it's their fault that the other dogs "turned mean" in the first place.<br>  <br>  try to get ahold of the breeder of the pup and let them know how the dog will be kept. explain what happened to the others.  if the breeder is responsible, they won't sell the dog to them. look into local laws about neglect and extended tethering, and see what they say. you may be surprised at what you find.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Poor dog! I don't know of anything that could be done unless you could get in touch with the breeder<br>  <br>  It's a shame you can't divorce relatives|`|DHGrfdBWaa	I'd try and find out if there is a pit bull rescue in the area and report this to them.  They might be able to intervene and keep them from acquiring another animal.  Pit's and Staffie's are wonderful animals but require a lot of attention and training.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Quite "typical".<br>  Pray for the pup.|`|Ezcyodycaa	Oh wow. That sucks for everyone.<br>  <br>  Well this is what happens with a lot of dogs, and it is sad. It's even worse when it happens to a Bully breed, because it not only just reflects badly on the breed, but you know these dogs can do a lot of damage if not cared for properly and trained. This is why I think there needs to be more regulation. For instance, you know how you have to have a dog license. Well, when someone gets rid of their dogs, there should have to be some kind of paperwork done on why the dogs were gotten rid of. And if it can be proven that someone was irresponsible in the recent past with dogs, they should either have to wait a couple years to get another dog or some kind of official training should be required(not everyone would have to worry about the regulation, if they took care of their dogs and trained them themselves.)<br>  <br>  But...in this case...I would say first of all explain to your cousins how bad this is. Maybe if you can convince them it is a bad thing, they won't push for the puppy and the mom won't go through with it. Tell them how cruel it is, ESPECIALLY for a bully breed which tends to be a very social animal, to lock that high energy dog up on a chain, which it will one day be able to break, and the dog will never get to do what it was meant for, which is to bring loving companionship to a family. And...if they still go through with it, you have to accept that it's not your fault and you can't change what they do...but maybe you can spend some time with the puppy? Maybe, if you live nearby, volunteer to walk it and you could spend some time trying to train it. Give it some companionship. And maybe when they inevitably go to get rid of the dog, you can be there to help find a good home. Be ahead of them.<br>  <br>  But it's just a fact that there are a lot of people that do this kind of thing, dogs are disposable fluffy things that are cute when they're babies but nothing more to them. What's the point of just having a dog that you lock up outside all day? You spend tons of money to keep it alive but you won't get anything else out of it, and neither will they.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can also look out for any signs of abuse or neglect and that should still constitute getting it taken away, even in a place with little animal regulation.
362fe59d2722cae185970ec1db3f7dcdaa	what could of happened for one he could have gotten a hamster thing called wet tail... which makes them go into coma stage like that and they get really cold and hardly move... if their cage gets to wet or switch there food can all have to do with getting it...  i have been breeding and owning hamsters for almost 3 years now.. also work at a pet store... and if you ever notice another hamster do that and check their behinds everyday to make sure they don't have wetness... there is a medicine call drytail for them... so i would keep a bottle of that all times if you own a hamster...|`|3MxSepRdaa	Hamsters will sometimes die for no apparant reason. I had a hamster for less than 2 weeks who showed no signs of sickness and one morning he was dead. Lettuce would not have killed your hamster, I have given little bits of lettuce to my hamsters and they like it. <br>  <br>  Hamsters are prone to tumors, cancer, and lung infections as well as wettail. When we own hamsters sometimes it happens and there's nothing we could have done to prevent it.|`|FYISPUt4aa	he might have got too cold?  or was sick and you didn't know? iceberg lettuce would not kill him. iceburg lettuce has no vitamins and minerals in it, like green leaf lettuce has. it is not poisonous.
FYISPUt4aa	It would be fine to breed the two syrains. the hair length is the only real difference. I'm glad to hear you found homes for the 6-10 babies they will have before you bred them. more dog breeders need to find homes before they breed.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Your question says to me that you haven't done nearly enough research to be breeding.<br>  <br>  Why are you breeding? Think about it. Breeding is not a game... it's not a matter of just putting a male and female animal together. Mess with the wrong genes and breed the wrong animals and you could end up with some very sick babies. Do you know the mom and dad's genetic/health history at least three generations back? Pet store animals should never be bred, you know nothing about their health background. It doesn't matter if they seem healthy now or the vet gave them a clean bill of health... it's what's in their genes. There are more than enough small animals in shelters and rescues without more poorly bred ones being added to the overpopulation. There's a lot more to breeding responsibly than you might think. Please read and make a responsible decision: <br>  <a href="http://www.petinfopackets.com/aboutbreeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petinfopackets.com/aboutbreed...</a><br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	I would get the answer to this question from where you asked about everything else so that it is consistent.

s6YmD7vaaa	I'd keep my pets with me & stay at the boyfriend's place.  That will give him a chance to really bond with your pets - & if he doesn't & the relationship suffers then so be it.  You want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't like your pets?|`|VSWl45cKaa	Your boyfriend wouldn't let you stay for free for 36 days? He is that anal about his house? How wild are your dogs? If you got married would the pets have to go? If so, is he the kind of boyfriend you would want? If he values your relationship he would have offered to take you in already.<br>  <br>  Option 3 sounds like a zoo, an expensive one.<br>  <br>  Swallow your pride and stay with your Mom. It seems that she has offered. What issues would lead you to say that you would  "kill each other"? Can't you suck it up for 36 days especially if home ownership awaits at the end of it? To help out a bit, and avoid freeloading, give her the $100 a week you would have had to give to your 'generous' boyfriend.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Stay with your boyfriend, crate train your dogs, take them for lots of walks and do whatever activities/training they enjoy so they DON'T destroy things and make messes.  And if they do make a mess and it hurts your relationship, it's not much of a relationship in the first place and best to find that out now before you invest any more time in the guy.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Am I the only one who thinks a boyfriend that doesn't like dogs is a bad place to stay? You cannot watch the dogs 24/7 and I wouldn't trust the guy alone with my dogs. I would rather stay with #3.

If he can't take it for so short a time, then he's not worth keeping.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|W0buucLsaa	I'd say (2), but I don't think your relationship has much of a long-term future if he's anti-dog and you love dogs enough to have two of them. You could stay there and buy crates.<br>  <br>  Do you not have any other dog-loving sympathetic friends that would be willing to let just your dogs stay there for a month? Ones without toddlers? I've taken care of friends' dogs for up to three months before, when they had hard times.<br>  <br>  Also, are you sure you can't find a small one-bedroom apartment or house whose landlord needs income so badly that they'll be willing to rent it out for just a month?|`|xrRZeROmaa	The dogs are a part of who you are.  You are also a part of who the cat is.  so arrange for the dogs to stay, at a price with your friends who are willing to take you in.  That way the dogs could spend the time you are not able to attend to them personally, with someone who knows how to care for dogs, and appreciates them.  <br>  <br>  Keep the cat with you, unless you want to lose the cat to someone the cat chooses.  Stay with the boyfriend, and have your dogs as often as possible with you.  <br>  <br>  You will need to pay your friends to care for your dogs when they have them, but hopefully , not 1500 a month, as you would have the dogs at least half the time.  Dogs are very adaptable, so long as they become aware that you haven't really abandoned them.  <br>  <br>  If the problem of the dogs and the boyfriend becomes too big, then you still have the option to move back in with your mother, and board the dogs.  <br>  <br>  Another option, is to simply rent a place, like a motel room for the interim.  Many motels offer pet friendly atmospheres so long as you pay an additional fee for the pets.  It seems to me that 1500 a month should pay for both you and the animals.|`|kceGobAXaa	Well, at least you have options...lol<br>  <br>  I guess number 2 would be best.  If he is a good man, he can take the good with the bad.  It may not be his ideal scenario, but it is only temporary.  And quite frankly, if it does strain your relationship, it is best to find out sooner than later.  Boyfriends come and go, your dogs will love you unconditionaly for the rest of their lives.|`|n5URUEqXaa	2- <br>  Pros:<br>  It is cheapest.<br>  It will bring you and boyfriend closer<br>  It will bring your dogs and your boyfriend closer<br>  <br>  <br>  Just make sure your dogs are good.<br>  If you see them eyeballing something it often means they want to get it, either to play with or shred, so make sure they dont get anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Your dogs and boyfriend will be fine!|`|CPPLKzcPaa	Stay with your mom or boyfriend and ask if you could maybe borrow the money for boarding the dogs?
H0fXySX9aa	it could be anything the dog needs to see a vet|`|cnZlMojUaa	This is only based on personal experience, not any medical diagnosis online of someone's dogs. Get to the vet ASAP. It could be kidney failure. When my dog went into kidney failure it started with vomiting, then she refused food, did not drink enough and was lethargic. Bad breath often accompanies kidney failure. Something bad is going on here and a vet is needed. My dog was under the care of a vet internal medicine specialist and we still lost her.<br>  <br>  The vet will check the dog for dehydration and provide fluids either under the skin or by I.V. The vet will check the blood to determine organ function including the kidneys (BUN and Creatinine levels). A urinalysis may also be needed to see if the urine contains high sugar levels, how it is concentrated (again kidney function), and check for bacteria. <br>  <br>  Realize, this is what I faced, so I think kidney failure. There are many other things this could be. <br>  <br>  In kidney failure there are 2 types: Accute, which is often brought about from a poisoning; and Chronic, which is brought about by disease progression, severe and irreparable damage from an accute cause, and/or aging.<br>  <br>  Please share this information with your friend. It is very important that this dog gets to a vet TODAY. <br>  <br>  To check for dehydration, touch the dog's gums. If they are dry, sticky or tacky the dog is dehydrated. Also, lift the skin at the scruff of the neck near the shoulder blades. The skin should immediately snap back in place. If there is a lag or the skin remains in a peak, the dog is suffering dehydration.|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	That dog needs to see a vet asap!|`|a9UM7c4Naa	my dog did this about 2 weeks ago! i assumed he'd just eaten something he shouldn't have done.<br>  <br>  I was really worried because after a day of being sick he went off his food for a week and looked ill.<br>  <br>  I tried tempting him with different foods and tuna seemed to work the best?<br>  <br>  I nearly took him to the vet but then he started to start eating his food again.

Dkb2ZR3Daa	Actually eating poo is a condition called corpophagia and it's sorta common-gross I know!<br>  <br>  One universal problem with dog behavior is that we don't always know why they do things. Here are some ideas as to why your pup would be starting this behavior...<br>  <br>  *Imitation, mom dogs with new puppies will often clean up their poop to keep the area clean. This is an instinctive but temporary behavior. The theory goes, if a puppy sees mom eating the stuff, she figures that she can snack on it, too.<br>  <br>  *Diet Issues, If you are overfeeding your dog, her under digested poop looks a lot like what she had for lunch. If you are underfeeding your dog, she is scavenging for food and is willing to lower her standards. If your dog has a vitamin or mineral deficiency, she may be looking to cure it.<br>  <br>  *Boredom, She may be eating the poop for the same reason that she chews on your shoes or digs in the yard, she needs something to do.<br>  <br>  *Medication, some dogs have been known to start eating their own poop when they are taking certain antibiotics.<br>  <br>  *Habit. Whatever began the behavior, your dog will continue it just because it has become a habit. Dogs are as habit bound as we are, and once they have picked up a bad habit, it will take some patient persistence to break that habit.<br>  <br>  It will not harm the dog, but worms can be ingested this way from a dog eating infected poo. It's just an extremely gross habit to start! If it starts to become a problem they make products out there called For-Bid and Deter that cause the poop to taste really bad! Yeah, I can't really imagine it ever tasting good to start with but lol none the less it works. Or even picking up the poop right away.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|2rwNv5OHaa	I have heard from a veternarian that if you sprinkle ACCENT, a meat tendorizor on the dog food before they eat once it goes through their system and they want to consume the feces that it completely deters them from eating it. I believe another Yahoo posted this below with a different meat tendorizer. Its worth a shot and may only cost them $3 for the seasoning. Good Luck|`|RJHB8TvOaa	ew that is disgusting! <br>  <br>  What you need to do is: <br>   <br>  Everytime this little doggy does a poop and tries to eat it clap your hands really hard and loud ans screetch "AH AH AH!"<br>  The doggy will run away. <br>  Persist in doing this<br>  And the doggy will soon realize<br>  poop eating = loud nasty noises. <br>  <br>  Good luck <br>  Nina x|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	I do believe that he is vitamin "hungry."

yEUo24Znaa	I train every single one of my dogs to obey every command with verbal cues, hand signals and the whistle. (think morse code)  I use verbal when they are close enough to hear me without me shouting. Hand signals when silence or stealth is called for or I am having a conversation and need to correct them, or close field work.  The whistle is used when we are coursing and covering large tracts of ground or thick cover that makes a lot of noise while walking through it. The whistle carries far and is distinct.  Each one has a place and use for me.  I would hate to have to choose only one method.   None of these will be effective unless your dog knows that the command given is NOT AN OPTION. He MUST obey it.  The whistle alone will not accomplish that, as you may already know.  I feel it is an excellent tool,  and used properly can only enhance and improve your training routine.|`|WQlCxeFlaa	I've done it with my dogs. It works really well. They caught on very quickly.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Your problem is more complex than you think.

Your problem can't be resolved by 13 year old "experts". (and it's a complex one). When I say "trainer", I mean someone LOCAL that can help you with the process and your education. Whole books (different schools) have been written on the subject of training. The recall is only the tip of the iceberg.|`|AA12128656	whistle training works, if it's done properly.<br>  <br>  since he's young, and he probably wants to play a lot, start training him to come (with the command or the whistle) while he's on a long line. then you can reel him in EACH TIME if he doesn't do it voluntarily. <br>  <br>  also, when you call him and he looks like he's about to run away, don't give him the chance!! YOU turn and run the other way! he'll follow YOU! never give into his game and chase him, then he's training you.|`|VtHvcEtuaa	I haven't done whistle training, but I have trained my dog to come.  Here is what I did.  In a fenced in yard, I had my dog sit on one side of the yard.  I showed my dog I had a really great treat such as cheese or chicken and told her to stay.  I would slowly back up and go to the other side of the yard.  Then I would say "Shellie (name of my dog) COME" and she would bolt over.  When she came, I gave her the treat, praise, and said "good come Shellie"  She learned it pretty fast.  You can also do this in your house if you do not have a fenced in yard
FVD1tpLeaa	actually, I think it can be a very dirty job.  Cleaning out kennels, washing the dogs, shoving them into a gas chamber, listening to them scream, and then cleaning out the bodies.  Sounds pretty dirty to me.

Now the gasing of dogs is (IMHO) cruel and barbaric and would be VERY disturbing to view...i've seen it done. It made me vomit to witness.<br>  <br>  i agree it would definitely bring some awareness to the plight of shelter dogs, but Mike usually pokes fun at the jobs he's doing, even at slaughter houses (probably because he's uncomfortable more than being unsympathetic) and i don't think he would set the right tone for it.|`|iU1ULFWVaa	I've seen him go to a home groomer one time, which was nothing compared to working at a full grooming/kennel place, wish he would have come to where I used to work!! I think it would be great if they did a show at a shelter, but I'm not sure about them showing any euthanasia. Even though he did a show on road kill and people that use the road kill as art.

pSX5stBHaa	The grooming industry is a great place to work.<br>  There are a few serious schools to look at.<br>  NY School of Dog Grooming<br>  Nash Academy<br>  You can also check and see if you can apprentice under a master groomer.  I provided this for my students out of my shop.<br>  A great book to get is Notes From the Grooming Table.<br>  Make sure to go to www.petgroomer.com and take a look around.<br>  If you want to be a groomer there are few things you need to take a look at.<br>  Do you like animals?<br>  Do you like people? <br>  Can you deliver great customer service?<br>  Are you patient? ***This is important as you are working with animals. They will not stay still all the time.  If you have little patience, then this is not the job for you.<br>  Can you pick up dog poop, pee and vomit?<br>  Can you deal with any of the above landing on you?<br>  Can you deal with a dog screaming, barking, whining, AND biting?<br>  Do you have an artistic side to you?  When grooming Poodles and Bichones it takes a steady hand and some talent to make them look great.<br>  Hand scissoring is key.<br>  This is not the type of job where you get to play with dogs all day long.  You will work and work hard if you want to get any where.  Your satisfaction will come from an outstanding hair cut, happy dog, and happy owner.<br>  Visit a local grooming shop and ask if you can hang out and watch what goes on to truly see if it's for you.<br>  Petco and PetSmart have their own classes.  It is a good place to cut your teeth.<br>  There is no certification process to be a dog groomer.  Anyone can call them selves a groomer.  But the schools that I gave you are reputable and good.  You also might want to try your hand as a bather in a local grooming shop or at any of the big box retailers.  A great bath and fluff dry makes for a great hair cut.<br>  Hope this info helps.<br>  www.goldenrottie.blogspot.com|`|QVP8zSuWaa	She needs to go to a grooming school, after school she will work as an apprentice under an experienced groomer. <br>  Others might say you do not need school but you will not learn all aspects or correct techniques without school.

Turtles/tortoises in general need incredibly large enclosures for their size, and if you got one that gets huge, you would need a monstrous enclosure.  Not to mention that proper turtle setups are often very expensive, and you need to give them a varied diet to keep them healthy.<br>  <br>  Not to say that you wouldn't be able to care for them, just that most people mistakenly get a cute little turtle, stick it in a small tank, and feed it commercial turtle pellets, and skimp on their requirements.<br>  <br>  My suggestion - Go and find out EXACTLY what species they are, and look up online caresheets for that particular species.  Do as much research as you can, and think long and hard about whether you are willing to devote that much time, money, and space long term.<br>  <br>  Turtles can make great pets, but they are not for most people.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3IUMh4Igaa	First off, if it gets huge, it is a tortoise. <br>  Second, You should know the name of what you are going to buy. <br>  Third, They do need daily attention and special lighting. <br>  <br>  All turtle and tortoises need heat lamps and UVB lighting. They require daily feeding with vitamin supplements. When they do get really HUGE, they need a very large area in your yard...

Are you thinking of an alligator snapper? Are you willing to dedicate an entire room to keeping it? They usually only get to 2 feet long (shell length) but the record is more than 2 1/2'. At ten gallons of tank per inch of shell, you are talking  about small swimming-pool size. A bath tub would be too narrow. Common snappers stay smaller; a bathtub would probably suffice for its entire life.<br>  <br>  If, however, you are thinking of sea turtles, forget it; they are endangered and protected.

NEVER ANYTHING WITH BEANS...MY SON LEARNED THIS ONE THE HARD WAY!<br>  KEEP HER ON A CONSISTANT DRY DOG FOOD DIET OF THE NORMAL FOOD YOU FEED HER, NO TABLE SCRAPS FOR WHILE AND IF YOU MIX WET AND DRY FOOD, TAKE MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE WET AWAY FOR A WHILE UNTIL THE MATTER IS TAKEN CARE OF.<br>  Some dogs stomachs are more sensitive to change...or too much of what is to them A REALLY GOOD THING if they get table scraps!<br>  Actually, she could be just having a cold or virus symptom...dogs get them like we do, sometimes.<br>  My BEST guess is the food one, with an added comment. <br>  She is getting "up in years" for a dog. This is a case all of its own. When dogs OR PEOPLE for that matter, become older, they just cannot handle certain foods anymore...or STRESS, which could also be a cause if anything stressful to her may have happened lately, like perhaps another dog coming into her home.<br>  Doesn't sound serious, but if it continues on any regular basis at all, for a long time, take her to the vet.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Bunny7|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	If she is drinking that is good.

They are usually wonderful for a telephone consultation if you feel that you need help.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Do not feed for the rest of the day.  More food will be more mess. Tomorrow when the diarrhea has subsided, boil up some chicken and rice and give that to her. I would do this for a day or two before returning to her regular food.  If you're going to give Pepto, you need to call your vet for dosage.

If you can get hold of her at all, something you can do is get some flea treatment on her; one of the spot-ons so application is mimimum hassle. Just don't use anything from a pet store (other than Frontline). This will help if it is fleas.

That's about all you can do for this problem at home.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|WqGxGJkbaa	It could be due to fleas, mites, an allergy or ringworm.  If it is ringworm there will be patches of missing fur and a slight red circle on the skin.  If you think it could be ringworm then you will need to take your cat to a vet.  Your vet can also advise you on treatments for mites/allergies.|`|gdxkIGhGaa	My cat is too, it's only the fact that he's really itchy in that area, just put a cone on his head along with some cream you can get from the vets clinic.

EeJMITyCaa	I think Beer and chicken is better. Dogs don't like beer anyway or alcohol. Nobody naturally likes alcohol really. It's an acquired taste and also most alcohol tastes like crap and the only reason people drink it is to get drunk.

gAJHfQGaaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  There should be no need for soil because aquarium plants absorb nitrates straight from the water in the substrate. You should put plants only in a well developed tank, about three months old. The fish will poop in the tank and this will fertilize the plants. If you are getting into super expensive specialty plants, try googling it or ask the aquatic store. It is a lot easier than you think so don't fret too much. :)<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|RXYZb6bsaa	depends on the plant, google your species and im sure youll find what u need.  id take them out of the buckets
f0dXmrJiaa	she does not care whos eggs they are she just wants babys and wiil keep sitting till they come|`|AybizeQJaa	We place all eggs under 1 hen and raise all just fine.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Chickens do not know which one laid which eggs and will set on plastic eggs or golf balls when broody. I would keep 14 or 15 aside for my Dominique hen as she was big enough to cover 15. I kept them at room temp and rotated the older ones out when I placed fresh ones in the 18 hole egg carton. I was ready when she started to set and placed all those eggs under her. Oh! I also moved her nest box to a like item with no bottom and put it on the ground so that the eggs would get the very much needed moisture for a proper hatch. I actually built an animal proof fence around her, with a top wire, and gave her water and food.|`|2rXWZkbnaa	It doesn't matter if you put a golf ball under the chicken while it is broody. It will still protect it. What you should do is check which ones are fertilized then let the broody hen sit on them. Also if you want the chicks to live you should either raise them yourself at ninety degrees or you could put a heat lamp outside and the chicks will be warm but then the chickens will be too warm. Also what type of chicken do you have?
bFzu835Aaa	It's only been 5 days, depending on the individual birds it can take some time for them to fully adjust and relax in a new home. <br>  <br>  Generally birds like noise (as long as it's not horribly loud or startles them) and will make lots of it if you are. My birds all love to "talk" at the same time when everyone is getting home from work and the house becomes more animated.<br>  <br>  Give them some more time, be patient, and talk softly to them as much as you can. They'll eventually become more relaxed and playful.|`|jjdnmBm3aa	That love reflects; faith; honest;struggle, and make a family.|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	<a href="http://parrotcentral.net/lovebirds.htm" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/lovebirds.htm</a>|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	What is the question?
3tAmFznUaa	They are talking with the radio on because they feel safe.  <br>  <br>  They get quiet when you come in because they aren't sure if you eat birds or not.  (I am sure you don't, but they don't know that yet)<br>  <br>  Try the "fake sleep" trick in the room with them.  Just sit quietly, don't look straight at them.  Kind of peek from under your eyelids and pretend to be asleep.  They should relax and start talking again.  If they do, they have decided you are safe.  Then you can take the next step and start working toward hand taming your pets.  If they have not been hand feed, and are already bonded to each other it may take a lot of patience on your part to win their trust.  Work with one at a time, and take your time.  You can expect to get nipped, if you don't freak they probably won't either.|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	I don't see why you shouldn't handle them, go ahead and play with them!<br>  The more you play with them the faster they're getting used to you and their new surrounding. When they get quiet when you come in is because they're "checking you out" lol. Birds love to compete with other noises, my cockatiel used to go crazy when I vacuumed, lol.<br>  Sounds like you're doing a great job!
9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	Usually closed eye could mean other diseases but since the bird got in a fight it's not that big of a deal. But, it's been couple of days and an infection could have built up. You should get an eye cream which should be reffered by the vet or go to your local petstore and see if they have a cream there. <br>  <br>  Usually for cuts I use neosperin (humans use it) but since it's the eye it should be bird specific.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	It sounds as if he has an eye infection.  The infection could spread to his internal organs, if left untreated. <br>  <br>  He needs to see a vet for prescription antibiotics.
vjijiJT3aa	because your bird is from a breeder and that helps the breeder identify its babies and parents, males and females, and also to prevent relatives mating. So it means nothing really to you or your bird but it was a big help to the breeder your bird came from.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	It is for identification and I hate those bands. My bird (cockatiel) in the past got that band caught in one of his toys and his feet almost came off. As much a I aprreciate the identification part I say try to get it off by a vet or a pet store expert. <br>  <br>  It often annoys the bird and if the bird keeps chewing it is annoying the bird.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	I assume its a closed band.<br>  Its for identification, and also proof that it was captive bred.
6XDJRgiBaa	Work Hard. Party Hard.|`|sW8eg01saa	wow your back again what about go green i thought that was a awsome idea
j58sTKGjaa	well my cat does the same thing and i think she is really further along than i thought cause it been about 2 months and she has been licking her self in her virgina area and grooming herself a million times a day so it would be good to call your vet and get her a birthing space raedy it needs tobe in a warm dark quite place...that is my best answer
DTTROeA0aa	I really feel like ranting - not at you - but all these other people that are so anti breeder and breeding that it comes right out of the HSUS playbook!  Why should breeders have to justify themselves to avoid being pilloried?  It is like asking every man to stand up and prove to the world that he is not a wife beater, and demanding that every bank teller puts on a T-shirt saying "I am honest, I don't steal" .... anyway..... rant over....<br>  <br>  Have you taken her temperature? Has it dropped far enough? If yes, and it went back up she may need a C-section right away, if no, you can hang in until tomorrow and keep checking.  Does the vet have x-ray equipment?  How easy would it be to get a blood sample to a lab for a progesterone test?  If it drops below 2ng she SHOULD go into labor - if not she may have primary inertia.  If it is still above 2 ng she is not ready yet. Also sperm can live for up to 5 days and her eggs may not have been ready for fertilsation when she was bred, so whelping dates can be somewhat unpredictable.   Good luck!|`|S5Lz35myaa	I've talked to several boxer breeders in my area, and many said the same thing - often their boxers have to have c sections, as they cannot pass the puppies safely because of their large heads.<br>  Ask your vet for their opinion, but I would plan on c section.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	It's not unusual for b1tches to go over their due date. I've had a litter (not Boxers) born 5 days after the expected date. I took her to the vet around 7pm who said bring her back in 36 hours for a C section because she wasn't showing any sign of whelping. 2 hours later she produced her 1st pup ...........!<br>  Don't leave her too long or you risk losing all the pups. I'd leave her until Saturday as long as she seems fine in herself tomorrow.<br>  Good Luck - fingers crossed that she gets a move on!|`|aCqSF87Raa	She's been to the vet for confirmation x-rays, correct? So you know for a fact she IS pregnant and how many pups to expect? I was thinking along the lines of phantom pregnancy...?<br>  <br>  Otherwise a you sure you got the dates correct? Could she have conceived a few days later? I would go with what your vet tells you. Maybe he/she has some ideas of why your b*tch went over.|`|EeJMITyCaa	That's weird. Why dint' you call a vet? That's what sets professional breeders apart from BYB. Are you just going to sit there and be stumped or call the vet?
a57f8d44133aa130472b860987795c0caa	If you're serious, then you should clean the cat asap or it may start grooming itself and ingest the antifreeze. Don't let it lick that stuff off.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Don't "try to get pictures of it!!"  That would mean you would have to expose your cat to that cruelty again!!!  Keep your cat indoors and just watch those people.  You have done what you can for now, if the authorities won't help appealing to a higher court (local shelters may be able to help) might be an option.  But for the love of pete keep your cat inside, don't let it anywhere near that house again.|`|4TX26viFaa	Personally I'd call the news stations or talk to a reporter from the paper.  Tell them the lack of follow up with the police and animal control.<br>  <br>  You CAN file a police complaint against the neighbor since she was doing something dangerous to your property. Don't let the police tell you otherwise. What the neighbor did was wrong and you most definately can file a complaint against her.<br>  <br>  Do you have an alderman in your section of the city?  They're in the phone book, government pages in the white pages section.  Phone there and talk to them too.  Also, if your city has a neighborhood group you can make a complaint with them as well.|`|F08HDRvraa	Sorry that you had to find out the hard way that animal control won't do anything unless of course your pet bites or scratches someone, then they will be all over you. It won't do any good to report the animal control person because they are probably just doing what they are told to do.  If they did not see the person pour antifreeze on your cat, there is nothing they can do.  I had a neighbor child get bitten by my small dog (that was in my fenced back yard).  Kid said he was playing, fell with arm on fence and dog jumped up and bit him.  These brats were always reaching over the fence hitting the dog - guess what, animal control cited me for having a dangerous (15 pound) dog, and I had to put additional fencing up.<br>  All you can do is keep your cat inside or try to set up some type of enclosure for your cat to be in when outside.|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	Damn, their lazy.<br>  Keep telling them, they have to do something if they have proof or not.<br>  Tell that ***** to leave your cat alone, and you're calling the animal welfare people on her!<br>  Honestly, keep trying, call the RSPCA too.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Keep the cat indoors.<br>  <br>  There are all sorts of sneaky nasty things this woman can do to hurt your pet.|`|UQWusO1waa	problely she doesnt like the cat digging her garden and pooping there. Its illigal to let your cat roam loose in most places. I let mine roam all the time.it lives outside. EDIT: SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL YOUR CAT.HOPING YOUR CAT WOULD INGEST THE ANTIFREEZE WHILE GROOMING. there would be no other reason to have used anti freeze. use this angle, take her to small claims court where she can explain her actions to a judge. Dont complain she tossed it on the cat, complain that she was trying to kill your cat. poisoning animals is illigal and i subject to fines and jail. call the police back and file a animal poisoning  complant. ask your vet/groomer for a " written opinion" of what would happen if your cat groomed itself and ingested the AF. So you can have this evidence. Also, a statement from the cop that there was indeed AF.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	You should have called THE POLICE, not animal control.  Animal control deals with stray animals, not animal abuse.  What your neighbor did was a CRIMINAL OFFENSE, and should be reported to the police.  They may not be able to do anything this round, but having it on report could be helpful if they do something to another animal in the future.... in the meantime KEEP THE CAT INDOORS.... period.   Anyone who'd do that is trying to kill the animal.  and SHAMPOO THE CAT IMMEDIATELY, don't wait for an appointment.... anti-freeze is DEADLY and if it's on your cat's fur, they'll lick it off and could die from it.|`|lHHIRu5Taa	yes please keep your cat indoors if you can, they will hurt your cat again. I know of people putting poison out with meat to lure animals (sometimes pets) to keep them off their property. This person is sick, and there is no telling WHAT they will do to your cat next. If you MUST keep him outdoors, make sure you file a complaint with the police, and document everything that happens to your animal, hopefully they can fine or arrest the person before its too late for your cat.<br>  <br>  however, in my area, cats are not allowed to roam outside, and the fine would be on me. you should check the law on that before you make a conplaint.|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	are you kidding me?! your neighbors must be really ignorant, what i would do is try to get pictures of neighbors doing this and then show it to the animal control police, get some kind of proof. I can't believe they didn't do anything about it! retards......|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Was your cat on their property?<br>  <br>  This is abusive, but your neigbor sounds like she may have a mental issue. I would keep your cat indoors and speak to a police officer to find out if you can do anything about this.|`|FYISPUt4aa	Proof would help to prosecute. call the Humane Society or ASPCA or even PETA and they might be able to help more. <br>  <br>  Keep your cat in your house! my 3 cats live only inside and are much safer than an outdoor cat.|`|NaMvJKsuaa	It is a violation and you should address to the animal rights organisation.Surely there is a penalty for this.|`|bzfXbM4raa	This is where bricks start flying through windows...if you know what I mean...what a *****.
iIGOi2Idaa	Yes I think the tobasco sauce is a horrible idea too - for the cat, not your apartment! In fact, I can't believe a vet would suggest something like - please see another one! <br>  <br>  You need to find out WHY the cat's doing this before you can stop it. There is certainly no point trying to 'correct' the behaviour - if this is behavioural, it's going to be a stress response so any form of correction will not help matters.<br>  <br>  Please see a different vet; one who can first ensure there is not a medical cause, and then assist you with any possible behavioural cause. Feliway is a good strategy when dealing with any form of stress in cats; ask a vet about this.<br>  <br>  Chalice|`|QvF7ZJibaa	i work for a human society, and yes they do that if they have allergys, maybe try changing his food, there may be something in his food that hes allergic to, i know dogs will bite themselves till they bleed if they are board, <br>  so maybe get some new toys for you cat or maybe get another cat for him to play with and maybe he wont have time to do that if hes occupied with anohter cat.|`|9kMJJ1giaa	I would take him to the vet.  The vet should have a better answer.  Maybe the allergy medication/treatment needs adjusted.<br>  <br>  Trying to correct him is not going to do any good at all!  There is more than likely a medical reason he is doing this.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  GO TO ANOTHER VET!  and don't ever go back to that  vet!|`|FYISPUt4aa	First ask your vet. then try toys to keep his attention away from chewing. try a grain free food. it may be a food allergy. Do you use chemicals on your carpet or floors that might irritate his skin? it could be just stress! there are so many possible reasons.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Have you asked the vet to check the cat's thyroid? <br>  <br>  Hyperthyroidism is common in cats, and pulling out fur is one symptom.
q1Swxe3qaa	When my dog got neutered he had to wear that stupid cone! We took it off of him right when he got home, but he kept biting at the stitches and really hurting them, so we kept it on him for awhile. When we were around him then he could have it off for a little while. When we were gone he definatley had it on because he would hurt himself again!  He actually did fine drinking with it, yea it made a mess, but he did figure out that its easier to drink when the cone in on the outside of the waterbowl lol.|`|HgMFrllLaa	1. every decent dog owner "checks" his/her dog daily (so much to your "finding 2 days ago"<br>  2. unless you are severely handicapped, you can always remove the elisabethan collar (the "cone") and then after the drink/meal put it back.<br>  If you can type, I'm sure you can manage.<br>  BTW, the "cone" is also driving your dog crazy, so taking a "break" will benefit him also on the "mental" side.|`|LURQBU86aa	You can either take it off while he eats or drinks, or get a different type of e-collar. They sell inflatable e-collars at petco, and there's another type called a "bite-not"collar that may work better for your dog.|`|H0fXySX9aa	you take the cone off to let him drink and put it back on when hes finished<br>  had to do it with my dog|`|LELgaJ8oaa	feed him with a baby bottle...screw the vet your dog need sto drinks his water.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Take the cone off so he can eat and drink and put it back when he is finished.|`|L22hVXTIaa	For a few days, you may have to hold the water dish for him to get a drink, but I know exactly what you're talking about.  Years ago, one of my GSD's had to wear one of those cones which made eating and drinking difficult.  My husband got the idea to cut it down a little (so that the circumference was smaller) and it allowed the dog to eat and drink, but still prevented him from scratching.  <br>  <br>  You might try that, but nowadays, I think they also make a smaller cone - so you might want to check with your vet.<br>  <br>  Other than that, just offer him water by holding it for him a few times a day.  He'll be better soon and out of that dratted cone!
dE5fs9yzaa	Your tank is overcrowded. Goldfish can grow up to over 12 incheslong. Plus they produce loads of waste, more then tropicals do. The goldfish, comets I assume, will nip the fins of the slower moving Moor and possibly the fantails. if the fans are just fancy comets, maybe they are fast enough to run. But your tank is too small for all the fish. I'd keep the Moor and fans and get rid of the comets. Then start thinking about a larger tank. You also need to be sure that there is loads of oxygen going into the tank plus extra filtration.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Those are all goldfish. And no. 189-227 liters is what you would need for just the fantails and the black moor.<br>  <br>  284-341 liters is what you would need just for the goldfish.<br>  <br>  These are big fish, and you are putting them in a small tank. They are also massive waste producers. When you start noticing red marks on the fish, get ready for all the fish to slowly begin dying off. Red marks come from ammonia burns. Thats what happens when alot of waste is being added to the tank, and it just builds up. Its the reason most goldfish die. People dont realize that goldfish are large fish, and need large tanks.|`|jM6xUrrRaa	So long as they are all eating and not too stressed yes,<br>  <br>  I am not sure about the details of coldwater set ups, but just make sure they are not nipping at each other, and they are all eating.<br>  <br>  If one is not eating it is likely it feels intimidated.

I was thinking of adopting a rotty, doberman, or german shepard. You may want to look at great danes they are low maintenance, they are work dogs, highly trainable, and are so lovable. Theres nothing like a big dog snuggling up to you. And they are markedly good with children, and other pets. <br>  of course, like a rotty, they sometimes get hip problems when they are older, but since you have already had a large dog you probobly know all the risks.|`|AA12128656	the cane corso mastiff is a large, gentle breed, and doesn't drool as much as a bullmastiff. they're wonderful, just make sure you socialize when they're young. <br>  <br>  how about going on www.petfinder.com and looking up extra large dogs? you might find a big mutt that appeals to your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  good luck, and i'm sorry about your rotty.|`|V5Ib9BCsaa	i would go with a pit. they are great dogs. they have a 85% passing rate on there temperament test wich is in the top 95% of the breeds tested. they are great family pets. mine are great with my 2 yr old. most do have big heads and you cant mistake the "pit" walk. lol they are sweet, loving, loyal dogs. most can be a bit hard headed though so train them early. they werent originally bred to be over about 65 pounds but now a days they range from 55 to 120 pounds. i would say if your worried about the weight and specific look of your dog i would suggest a responsible breeder if you just want a good pet go check out your local shelters.|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	We lost our rottie to bone cancer last May.

TfuFjTMQaa	I'd say they were campells russian dwarf hamsters. They should be separated from mom when their about 4 weeks, because she'll be sick of them and be mean to them. <br>  <br>  Also if they are two girls, their fine together, two boys, fine together, but if there's a boy and a girl you need to separate them as well. Otherwise, they'll interbreed and that's not good. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your little bundles of joy :D|`|fGwZMglGaa	They are definately a dwarf of some sort. Probably chinese dwarf or russian.<br>  You should separate them a four weeks old into a cage for boys and a cage for girls and a cage for mum and a cage for dad.<br>  You should not breed them again for a while because it will reduce the mothers lifespan.<br>  Good luck with them =]|`|yb01tlviaa	you have russian dwarf hamsters.  you need to seperate them now.  hamsters are solitary and need to be by themselves, otherwise the mother WILL kill the babies.
e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	It's generally not recommended.  They work fine... when they work correctly. <br>  <br>  The main problem with them is that when they break, they no longer distribute heat evenly, and can create hotspots.  Reptiles don't notice these as well as other animals, they determine heat mainly by their overall core body temperature.  Meaning that they can sit over this hotspot and be burning their bellies without knowing.<br>  <br>  Basically using a heat rock is a gamble.  You never know if/when it will break, and using a "cheap" one is even riskier.  You can get the same result using a heat lamp over a piece of slate.  Or, better yet, get an undertank heater.<br>  <br>  Edit - The other poster is correct that some reptiles need overhead heat, but not all.  You have to look at their behavior in the wild.  Many snakes, as well as leopard geckos, are nocturnal, meaning that they do not openly bask in the sun, but rather rely on warm spots on the ground/sand that have retained heat from the sun throughout the night.  With any reptile, it is always wise to research their natural habitat and behaviors, and use that to dictate their care in captivity :-)|`|TkJn9gO0aa	"""It's generally not recommended. They work fine... when they work correctly. """<br>  <br>  "Snakegirl" pretty much nailed it with that statement. They are really prone to cracking, fracturing, and depressing which all result in "hot spots" that WILL burn your animal.<br>  <br>  And Reptiles do NOT need overhead heat as opposed to belly heat. It just so happens to be easier and safer to provide extreme temp localities in this "natural" manner. There is no merit in that argument..........just because it occurs in nature doesn't  mean it has to be done under controlled conditions. By that merit, should we simulate hawk attacks every once in a while...............you know, to keep it "naturalistic"? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|`|3IUMh4Igaa	NO, you should NEVER use a heat rock. Besides the dangers, they do not provide the right source of heat. When a lizard or snake basks, they heat from the top and bottom, not just the top. If you really don't want to use a lamp, get an under the tank heat, they are better then a rock, but a lamp with a black light or ceramic heater is the best.|`|oSXRSKFSaa	no never do that it can hurt him.
XK9RLaPeaa	Wildlife RehabilitatorS usually run off of government or state grants, and donations. For someone to start their own rehabilitation center, would be extremely difficult, especially right out of high school. You would need to work with an experienced rehabilitator, for many years. You learn everything they can teach you, and then you branch off to start your own. You wouldnt be able to get any grants, or even donations if you are inexperienced. <br>  If you really want to do this, then I would suggest volunteering at one right now. Usually they dont let you tend to the dangerous animals if you are a minor. You would be cleaning cages for the first few months. And when they see you are reliable, they let you care for the orphaned squirrels, bunnies, etc. Some ask you to get rabies vaccinations every so often. <br>  If you want a career working with wildlife, then you could also be a wildlife biologist, biologist, environmentalist, etc. Good luck!|`|7WUvPI8maa	talk with your career planning center and look into colleges that have wildlife majors and ask about the program. your never to young to be thinking about colleges and asking around will help you figure out what type of job in wildlife you would like and how to go about it.

3IUMh4Igaa	These are answers that you should know if you want to breed. Do some more research and then look into it. Also, if you are doing it for money, don't bother. You would have to have a very high end breeding stock to make it worth your while. <br>  <br>  DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Here's a reputable page that should answer all your breeding questions. <a href="http://www.ballpython.ca/gallery/breeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ballpython.ca/gallery/breedin...</a><br>  <br>  I'll answer yours anyway. <br>  <br>  When do they breed? You can't say they're ready because of their age-- it all depends on the size of the snake. 500g for a male and 1200 for a female is about the ready size.<br>  <br>  How to care for the babies? Yes, you will need an incubator and it is explained on the page I liked you to. You need money for the set up too. First you need to buy a scale, then an incubator and vermiculite. The temps have to be perfect or you will lose the whole clutch. you will have unhealthy babies that may have nerve damage due to inexperienced breeding. It not like rodents or dogs you have to know exactly what your doing.

TdrgZwnoaa	Here's a little something I found when I GOOGLED "DREAM PUPPIES";<br>  <br>  The store Dreamy Puppy in Chantilly, Virginia, has “NO PUPPYMILLS!” in big letters on their website, www.dreamypuppy.com. In small print, they say they get puppies from “SMALL BREEDERS WHO VALUE AND DEMAND ONLY THE BEST HEALTH IN THESE PUPPIES.” Please read their website for further assurances that they are different from the typical puppy mill store. How many dogs would you say a “small breeder” would have? 10? 20? 30? How about over 300? Because that’s how big Dreamy Puppy’s “small breeders” are. In fact, one of their breeders had over 750 dogs in 2008. <br>  <br>  They also say “WE PERSONALLY PICK UP THE PUPPIES WITHIN OUR LOCAL AREA…” Yes, that is true—instead of dealing with large brokers, they deal with the Lancaster County puppy millers THEMSELVES. <br>  <br>  The store calls itself “upscale.” So what if a store is clean and the owners appear to pamper the puppies? That just makes it more appealing to customers. What about the PARENTS of these puppies suffering, unseen, in cages for their entire lives? <br>  <br>  As of January 24, 2009, Dreamy Puppy had three newspaper ads posted on the wall inside the store, advertising that the puppies come from LOCAL BREEDERS. We have obtained health and PA state records showing that in 2008, Dreamy Puppy obtained puppies from these breeders in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the heart of puppy mill country. Dreamy Puppies is located in VIRGINIA. Pennsylvania is NOT LOCAL. <br>  <br>  ? Amos M.

He also has some great books out that you should look at.|`|AA12128656	go to your local pet store and have them help you fit him with a prong collar. it's an excellent training tool, and will make you want to walk your dog more! practice makes perfect, and the prong collar will make him easy enough to walk so you'll be more inclined to!<br>  <br>  it's NOT impossible for him to learn to heel, you need to change your technique. heeling isn't just walking next to you, it's your dog paying attention. to train him to walk in the right position, walk forward, when he starts getting ahead of you (not paying attention to where you are going) turn around and start walking the other way. he'll hit the end of his leash and scramble. if you do this consistently, he'll learn that he better pay attention to where you're going, or he's going to be off his feet!<br>  once he's learned that, you can teach him to "heel" with a favorite toy or a treat. heel is a learned command just like "sit" or "shake". once you show your dog what you want him to do, and that he'll get rewarded for it, he'll understand better.|`|0rAgtGNgaa	when you see the other dog hold the leash closer to his collar (this way you have a stronger and firmer hold on the leash) and when his attention gets drawn to something else quickly jerk the leash so that his attention is drawn away.   it will take several days, possible even weeks but he will learn eventually.|`|PhEl5Lyiaa	Maybe what you could do. Is try your hardest by holding him by his lead tightly by your side, nudging him slightly. Do not move from that spot until he realises he is not going no where until he stops pulling.. then maybe start to walk if carries on pulling do the same again, pull him back by your side stay still holding him tight and nudge him..<br>  Hope this helps xx|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Labradors are very easy to train. Remember to start your training away from distractions like other dogs. You might also benefit from rather using a harnass instead of a collar. But read my article "Don't let Fido pull you."|`|AA11922229	Google: Cesar Milan  The Dog Whisperer<br>  <br>  Watch his videos. Serious. It's not the dog.

We went to obedience school and tried different *tricks* to stop him from pulling.  We went from wearing a collar and leash to a harness that still didn't work so we got a gentle leader.<br>  <br>  Alot of people disagree with gentle leaders,  but for our dog it was the best choice ever.  from the moment we put it on we could control him on the leash.  He now back to the harness and is perfect on it (well we occasionally have a pulling moment on it but nothing like before).  We did have a professional fit the gentle leader on him and show us the proper way to walk him with it.  <br>  <br>  Also when you walk him make sure you're calm.  If you feel the least bit tense the dog will pick up on it.  You really have to hold your shoulders back and be confident to get the dog to follow your lead.  Calm and assertive has the dog whisper says lol, but it does work.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I have a large Lab mix who does the same thing.  I used to walk him with a choke chain, but when he got excited, he would almost jerk me off my feet (and I am not small :o))<br>  <br>  I bought a halti for him, and he is MUCH better, and easier to control when I use it.  The halti also enables me to keep his head up, so he cant sniff the ground and feed his prey drive, which adds to his excitement.<br>  <br>  He has gotten out of it a couple of times when he got very excited, but it ended up around his neck, so I did not lose him.  I have since tightened it.|`|2KC467tFaa	When my dog starts pulling, I'll do short, quick tugs on the leash. If she doesn't stop, then I'll make her sit, reward her for sitting, and begin again when she calms down. If she pulls again, I do the same thing. Bring treats with you. If your dog doesn't sit or stop pulling, Force him to sit or lay down until he's calm and willing to listen. Don't be mean, but let him know who's in charge. He won't be trained overnight, but just be persistent, and it will pay off. Good luck!|`|8JPDOXagaa	Its might be a good idea to invest in a harness, its harder for dogs to pull and will give you more controll.<br>  <br>  Training classes with your dog would may also be able to help with the issue.|`|u2zkRf8yaa	sometimes there is nothing you can do but to run with it|`|UUQXNhMtaa	They have a cure for that it is called obedience school, You will both need to go.|`|1c3a5b0a0832a2929d4405d20fc70602aa	i sorry but i have to say no to a prong collar. ive seen too many animals come in with wounds on their neck from  owners misusing prong collars<br>  <br>      my dog had the same issue but i fixed it.<br>     your  tension reactions aggression  and mood is transmitted through the  lead(leash) into your dog  YOU see the other dog and   instinctively grip the lead tighter which signals the dog that you are anxious and  your dog will react as such.<br>  <br>   start taking a firmer  grip all the time and  when YOU see another dog, ignore it. if your dog pulls say leave it firmly( no you don't have to be loud) and continue walking as if nothings gone wrong. if he still pulls pull once quick and firm on the  lead say "leave it" and continue waLKING. it sounds to me like you let your dog walk you,... not you walking your dog<br>  <br>   i have to say the other poster is right its no the dog its you, <br>   getting the dog to not be like<br>  " OMG ITS ANOTHER DOG ITS ANOTHER DOG LETS GO SAY HAIIIIIIIIII" <br>   is more important than  heeling for now. my dog still doesnt heel as well as others, but she doesnt go lunging acorss the street / store/ park   either because she  knows "leave it" means momys gonna tug on my lesh if i dont|`|GJLjNk5Waa	A great method to use is the tree method.  You become an immovable object until your dog ceases to pull at the leash and allows a slack to develop.  Just stand in place and allow the dog to sniff.  When the dog starts to pull, remain immoble. (Don't correct or enforce the pull)  As soon as slack is evident in the leash, move in the direction the dog wants to go.  Praise the dog!  As soon as the dog starts to pull again, stop dead in your tracks and repeat the process.  .<br>  <br>  Another trick is constantly walk in different directions. If your dog starts to get ahead of you, turn and walk the other way quickly. Praise when you get slack in the leash again.<br>  <br>  There are also training collars you can use, but you should only use these for training, and not a permanent solution.  However, I've found the tree method works best for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11650764	It is not completely impossible for him to learn heel. It is completely impossible for you to teach him heel. Buy him a halter, or a gentle choke chain and when he sees another dog, make sure you have total and full control of him. Do not pull, yank, and yell. Simply make him sit, stay, and reward him when he doesn't object. To decrease the chance of aggressiveness, or fear, socialize him often at dog parks, and with friends dogs. Dogs are like people, once they learn something a certain way, or grow accustomed to it, they tend to act on that familiar feeling. Let him play with other dogs while he is still young, and train him often! Labs are extremely smart, and are very obedient! Good luck!!|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Two products that I have had success with...the Gentle Leader; it looks like a muzzle but it's not, and the Sprenger training collar; it is expensive but works well. It is a prong collar and must only be used when you are working with the dog. It is not a substitute for training. You also have to work with the dog and teach him that you are walking him...not the other way around.<br>    Enroll in an obedience class. They will teach you how to train him. A walk should be a pleasure...not a game of tug of war.|`|iBTcF47gaa	hold cheese in your lead hand and when he sees it he will follow it right under it this stopping him from pulling but make sure you give him the cheese as he may get bored|`|kDz9gcMuaa	PULL back on the lead make sure not to strangle him. And tell him no loudly not to loud. Maybe teach him sit.|`|bsqSaXhQaa	pincher collar!<br>  When in the litter and with mom, the mother nips the scruff of their necks to let them know what's good and what's bad.<br>  <br>  The pincher collar simulates this. When he starts to pull tug on the leash with just enough force that he'll understand pulling is not allowed.<br>  Don't worry about him heeling though. Just focus on him pulling. Let him walk ahead but if he pulls, give the leash a tug.<br>  <br>  I have a lab too and within the first day of trying this he stopped pulling. Though I may not be a professional dog trainer and only 18 years old, I have worked at a boarding kennels. The owner was a trainer and breeder and other employees were trainers and dog owners.<br>  <br>  Also refer to Don Sullivan. He recommends the pincher collar as well. He's a professional trainer and it was his kit and his collar we used on our lab. <br>  But we returned the kit as we found we were already using his methods and just weren't consistent enough.
TmEoTapDaa	Why isn't your cat spayed? you are contributing to homeless animals. Is she lactating at all? then she is about to. Set up a quiet area with a blanket and a box and put her in it. Or even a big laundry basket with a blanket. That way she can climb in there to give birth and to nurse the kittens and be able to come and go as she pleases. That will be where the kittens live until they are walking around on there own. Have a vets phone number on hand incase anything goes wrong.|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	that's just what cats are like when there pregnant, lazy. usually when you see her searching around the house for a dark secluded area, then within 1 to 2 days she'll probably give birth, when she does this, she tries to make a nest that will be nice and comfortable. if you think that she might be having some problems when she is giving birth, then call a vet to walk you through it. Good Luck!
rDl9XR76aa	African Dwarf Frog and a betta may work because they stay separate. Betta will only attack other bright colored fishies because it thinks they are competiton. Frogs are kinda dull looking. Frogs also stay on the bottom.. They like to free float around the tank, too... sounds dumb, but they are actually pretty entertaining. Really though... I would give your betta at least a 2 gallon though. :-/ <br>  <br>  And here is some advice. There are two different kinds of frogs, but everyone mixes them up. So make sure your fish store knows what they are talking about. There is the African Dwarf Frog (which is the one you want).. Then there is the African Clawed Frog.. Which is what the other poster was talking about.. The African Clawed can get as big as your hand, if not bigger... And WILL eat everything, including your decorations, plants, and gravel at teh bottom of your tank. The African Dwarf Frog are cute lil guys that max out at 2-2.5 inches...and if they get that big, then they had some good genes.<br>  <br>  These two look pretty identical.. so I am going to tell you to Google African Clawed Frog and African Dwarf Frog pictures... because differences at that size are pretty subtle.. and you don't want to take home the wrong one.<br>  <br>  A lot of people get the Clawed version thinking it is Dwarf (because they are same size at petstore).. then when their Clawed Frog gets huge, and eats up every other fish in their tank... rather than trying to return it to pet store, they will release it into wild... And then it becomes an issue. African Clawed Frogs are actually banned in different states because it has killed off natural wildlife (example: California).|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The dwarf frogs will work fine. I have 2-3 in both of my 2.5 gallon tanks with my male bettas. Theyve been fine for almost 6 months now. I depends on the attitude of the betta. Most bettas get along fine with dwarf frogs, whereas a few of them will kill the frog.<br>  <br>  And Stephanie, there is a difference in African Dwarf Frogs and African Clawed Frogs. Wanna guess which one stays small?|`|OXNiEDROaa	My Betta and frog adored each other.  lol  if thats possible.  The betta killed everything else I tried to put in with him but lived with my frog for 6 years|`|2E2hHlCgaa	yes i think that will actually work... i always wanted to get a african frog for my tank of bettas... neon's... guppies and platties... but never got the chance cuz i dont have a top screen... they jump out when they get the chance and dont let there be any openings cuz they can find their way out and die...<br>  <br>  2 thumbs up...|`|FYISPUt4aa	I would not try that. if they are the same size it might work for a few weeks. African frogs grow fast and try to eat everything. I've seen a frog eat gravel from the bottom before! I think the fish will end up missing in the end.

If the cat is white too, then the fleas might not be able to see the collar.

M3jRtq2Aaa	It probably won't get over 15lbs.  Just imagine the bigger parent, and your dog probably won't get very much bigger than the largest parent.  It could be smaller than the smallest parent, but usually you think of it being about midway. There are more things to consider than genetics in dog size.  If you feed your dog really well, he will reach the largest size his genetics allows.  If he was born as the larger puppy in the litter, he will be bigger because he was strong enough to get the most milk. And just because the parents were 8-13lbs doesn't mean they actually reached the biggest size they could.  Perhaps they were runts who didn't get as much milk from their mother.  You just have to imagine a general range of a bit smaller than the smallest parent to a bit larger than the largest parent.  It really doesn't have a lot to do with it being a mixed-breed dog or not.  This applies to all dogs purebred or mixed.|`|bIaywrBCaa	It could be between 8-13 lb or even bigger.

They can be hard to settle and it's more difficult for them to focus than older dogs.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to ask your Mom to take the dog for a little walk each morning when you're at school.  I think this would help their bonding experience a great deal.  Dogs love walks and it will also give both of them a little exercise.<br>  <br>  Once they're back from the walk and the puppy has expended some energy and sort of connected with your Mom, she (the puppy) may be more interested in doing what Mom wants too.<br>  <br>  Hope that works - and, as the puppy matures, she will be less hyper too.

SbLeCOjZaa	Get a crate that can grow with her. It's important to make sure there isn't enough room in the crate for a potty area and a sleeping area. There should be only enough room for the pup to turn around. Put her in there while you are sleeping and while the pup is home alone. All other times, keep her close to you (preferably on a leash) and take her outside at scheduled intervals to potty(after eating, etc). When she goes outside, give lots of praise and treats! When she has an accident inside, try not to bring attention to it (unless you catch her in the act- then you can give her a stern "no" and bring her outside). Soon she will be potty trained!!!|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Forget about crate training. It is cruel.  Read my article on how to house train your dog or puppy. Its on my site.It is the best and fastest way to do it. There are also other training articles and links to other good sites.|`|3ioUdPuZaa	First it is important for you to know that at 6 weeks old a puppy is like a small child. They do not COMPLETELY have physical control over their need to urinate or have a bowel movement, YET. That ability comes with AGE just like it does for human babies.<br>  THERE DOES appear to be a difference in the TYPE of dog you have AND how what Pottying circumstances they had in the kennel, home etc...prior to you getting the dog. <br>  So I will include information for three types and situations.<br>  With all puppies night appears to be the problem time, or MOST problematic. THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN AND YOUR COMMITTMENT TO HAVING TAKEN THIS PUPPY TO RAISE.<br>  Make the pup a bed, preferrably in your bedroom...whether it be cage carrier (real good idea) or tie it on a very short leash to the bed with padding nearby for its "bed." OR some people prefer to have the pup sleep with them. (NOT a good idea for the future of your dog human relationship unless you WANT the dog to ALWAYS sleep with you. <br>  A puppy will USUALLY not go to potty in its bed or sleep surroundings. Now this might STILL happen if your leash is too long because of the outside area the pup is left to have to its use.<br>  Also, I have found that puppies who were raised in cages where they could freely go to potty ANYTIME without the 'potty' affecting their bed, will NOT catch onto this concept right away...only with some time...SO HAVE PATIENCE IF THIS IS THE CASE. At some point, he will begin to realize that he or she cannot potty in THIS bed environment, because (contrary to a caged kennel) dirty his or her bed!<br>  You may have some disturbing nights until the lesson is well learned. <br>  THIS FIRST POING ABOVE IS THE ESSENSE OF GOOD POTTY TRAINING.<br>  Second, YOU WILL HAVE to get up, at least once...in a HURRY at night to take the puppy outside to potty. Have an area prepared by a tree preferably and perhaps shrubs with another leash ready to tie the pup to until he "does his duty." Having it ready makes it LESS of a distrubance and makes the trip shorter. But make SURE he has had enough time to do his duty before bringing him or her back in...AND DON'T EVER FORGET TO TELL HIM "GOOD DOG (OR NAME."<br>  The words good and bad...and the word NO, are important first words for a pup to learn. YOUR INITIAL REACTION TO HIS HAVING AN ACCIDENT WILL BE TO SAY HE IS "BAD" OR SOME UNINTELLGENT PEOPLE EVEN WHIP THE PUP PHYSICALLY...DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WILL TEAR DOWN ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A GOOD AND TRAINED FRIEND WHO BEHAVES WELL IF YOU STEP OVER THE LINE TO EVEN MOMENTARILY LOSE YOUR TEMPER!<br>  For a while, you will likely have to put up with nightime visits outdoors. <br>  THIRD: To help you prevent this and stop it, TAKE ALL FOOD AND WATER AWAY FROM THE PUP AT ABOUT 5 P.M. OR 6 P.M. AND DO NOT PERMIT THEM ACCESS TO MORE UNTIL MORNING. <br>  Pups will always need to "relieve" themselves within 30 minutes after eating or drinking, so you can HEAD THE SITUATION OFF BEFORE ACCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN BY SIMPLY WATCHING YOUR FEEDING AND WATER TIMES AND PUTTING THE PUP OUT ON THE LEASH FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES WITHIN THAT 30 MINUTE GAP. If the pup goes to the potty indoors, take the feces OUTSIDE and put it on the ground by the prepared place you have for him to do his duty outside. <br>  ANIMALS SMELL for a place to relieve themselves, once he smells HIS waste in the same place enough times, he will NOT WANT to go to potty anywhere else. But make sure you use Bleach or other strong household cleaner to clean the mess up so that the SMELL will not be present in the place of the accident!<br>  This is PRETTY MUCH it...after a while as he or she grows, they will alert you to WHEN they must go and with taking away their food and water consistantly at an appropriate time at night, they will be able to make it through the night without accidents or having to go outside. Also AS THEY GROW, they will be more able to CONTROL their sudden urges to potty, like adults do. You will receive a SIGNAL from them when it is "time to go."<br>  REMEMBER THIS: THE REASON MOST PETS FAIL TO POTTY TRAIN IS THEIR OWNERS!<br>  YOU MUST BE COMMITTED, CONSISTANT AND NOT IRREGULAR IN YOUR TIMES TO FEED AND TAKE THEM OUTSIDE, AND YOU MUST PROPERLY HANDLE THE OCCASSIONAL ACCIDENT UNTIL THEY CAN CONTAIN THEMSELVES. THIS MEANS NO ILL TREATMENT. <br>  IF YOU PUNISH OR ARE HARSH, YOU WILL ACTUALLY DELAY YOUR PUPS ABILITY TO REACT AND LEARN NORMALLY...HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH, SO HE OR SHE WILL THINK POTTY IS BAD AND TRY TO SNEAK AND DO IT BEHIND YOUR BACK AND NOT WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO GO!!!!!!!!!<br>  FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS AND YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. <br>  ********For whatever reason, this theory does not ALWAYS work on some small breeds of dogs. They are more finicky about incliment weather and going outside IS NOT their idea of a good place to go! Also, small dog breeds have a higher or faster metabolism which makes it URGENT when they need to go, even as an adult. They also often are able to "pick up" little bits of food here and there that you m|`|AA11225724	oh the joy of puppies<br>  after your pup has finished eating take outside 15 mins after they are finished. then wait for the pup to do its thing<br>  when the pup does praise it .  keep doing this till the pup learns this<br>  they will but it will take time  <br>  have tons of patience & never punish the pup if there are accidents in the house<br>  <br>  enjoy your new pup|`|a122b01b1756aff821e49bd8aa9c60d0aa	You might also consider crate training.

Be patient. A puppy is a baby, and babies need time to master acceptable potty procedures. Young puppies don't have complete control of their bladders or bowels, and sometimes by the time they realize they have to go, they simply can't hold it any longer. It's your job to keep your puppy off your carpets until he's reliably trained, to teach him where he should go, and to be patient when he has an accident. At least your puppy doesn't wear diapers!|`|vrB5xqkpaa	Every puppy is different but I recently just got a puppy as well and what has worked for me so far is 1, taking her out every hour. 2, When she does go outside I praise her and give her a little treat, 3, I make sure to feed her the amount of food the vet said and I only feed her twice a day, the vet said if the puppy has food available all the time she might have an accident, 4 I have not left her alone in the house yet so there is little chance of an accident and her thinking it is ok. The 2 times she did have an accident was on the first day she came home. I was lucky and caught her in action both time so I was able to correct the problem. It does take time. I hope this helps and good luck.|`|gntQWX27aa	Don't worry it is as simple as a b c there is just three things you need to remember be consistent be calm and have a good sense of humor Basically all you have to do is be consistent you give your dog a meal then say 10 to 15 minutes later you must taken them out into the garden and give your signal like "go pee" etc. Once you do this after a while you should get used to it and just look for the signs like squatting or circling.

Don't go get him when he's barking, or he'll think that's his rewards.  But try an early morning walk and a late afternoon walk.  I really think this will reduce or eliminate the barking.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Give him to an animal shelter, and give your neighbours some peace.|`|KxjUim7yaa	He is trying to telly you something.

In short, he enjoys barking--it's a way to occupy himself when he's left alone.<br>  Fear barking, on the other hand, is a stress response. It's caused by something unknown to the dog, such as a sudden noise or another dog's bark. Fear barking can also result from sights and sounds a dog finds disconcerting, like skateboards or sirens. In these cases, dogs bark to send a clear message to whatever's scaring them: Stay away!<br>  A third type is frustration barking. This occurs when the dog is denied access to something he desperately wants, such as a favorite toy, a piece of steak, or the terrier on the other side of the fence.<br>  <br>  Here's how to treat this problem <a href="http://dogtime.com/barking.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/barking.html</a>|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Your dog barks because he is probably bored.

I know here in Las Vegas dog's aren't allowed in hair salons- It is a state law.

I had to do this as well 3 years ago with my 9 year old golden retriever. You are doing the best thing you can for him and it's obvious you love him so much to make such an unselfish and heart breaking decision. I will pray for you and your dog buddy as well. There really aren't any words that can comfort you right now. The love you have for him will always be there. God bless you and your dog.|`|XoknFyNvaa	Done! Let him know that there is a really cool English Bull Terrier, Mike, across the bridge that would love to play with him. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Rainbow Bridge<br>  Just this side of Heaven is a place called the Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to the Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine and our friends are warm and comfortable.<br>  <br>  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing: they each miss someone very special, someone who was left behind.<br>  <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; his eager body begins to quiver. Suddenly, he breaks from the group, flying over the green grass, faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into those trusting eyes, so long gone from your life, but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together...<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you at this difficult time.|`|aHi8KHj1aa	I'm very sorry to hear about your dog.  :(  Not sure where you live so this might not be a possibility but have you had your dog tested for Lyme Disease?

To have the birds removed the victim  must make a donation to the youth groups cause.

You need to call the vet right now and tell them you suspect he's choking.  If this is a case of choke, don't let him eat anything else until you talk to the vet.

Currently, it is what we refer to as "Suckle Bear". <br>  <br>  Orginally when she began this behavior, I considered it might be due to the fact that we got her at just 6 weeks old. ( I know 6 weeks is young to let a puppy go, but the fact was the owner of the litter WAS letting them go, I fell in love with the pup, liked her "working line" pedigree, both parents from BC herding people, liked the mother, and thought a young pup had a better chance with me, who used to breed and show dogs, than a pet home, so I took her. whew)<br>  <br>  However, in the past decades in which I did breed dogs, weaned some litters by 6 six weeks, I never had a "suckler".<br>  <br>  Upon discussing this behaviour with other BC folks, several owners admitted theirs did the same.<br>  <br>  My girl does not daily suckle on her bear, but maybe once a week. I have found that usually when she does, it is at night when she is pretty "wound up" and we are rather ignoring her watching TV and not entertaining her by playing ball (because we have already played for over an hour). She will seek her bear, suckle it to calm herself, relax herself....go to her "special place".|`|UzpSlfJhaa	My dog does this ALL the time.  He'll drag his blanket around the house and then plop down and start sucking on it.  He's 11 and he's done it his entire life.

They can be useful when dealing with gas or loose stool. Per my new vet, probiotics are a good thing to add to any cat's diet. She recommends using them only 2-3 times per week rather than daily, and not necessarily in the recommended amount (meaning less not more). <br>  <br>  When you start using them, you should add just a pinch to the food, and then gradually increase that if the cat is tolerating it without any smelly side effects. <br>  <br>  Dosage: I'm not measuring it, but I guess I add about 1/4 tsp. I dispense this 3 days per week. <br>  <br>  My vet also suggested varying the brands from time to time. As you finish one bottle, try another. <br>  <br>  How to choose: My vet also suggested not using one made for humans only because it may not be the right kind of bacteria. Avoid Saccharomyces boulardii which is from yeast. It should be dairy free, contain more than one type of bacteria, have a high number of organisms and few additives. The first two listed above are the ones I've chosen to use. They were recommended by the users in Whole Cat Health. The other two were also suggested by users of that group, but not as highly. <br>  <br>  For digestive enzymes, Dr. Goodpet is a good brand.  Get the one that doesn't have lactose.  Prozyme is another good one.  Actually, this might be the one that has lactose....but there's a variety that doesn't.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Yes love..I think your dog will sleep when she is tired.  Let me show you how to leash train you pup...I think this will help tire her out a bit more for you.  I realize when bored...pups can be little stinkers.  :)<br>  First off work in your house...back yard, somewhere comfortable for you.  You will probably end up "dragging" your pup off and on for a while until they get comfortable with it.  Make sure it's an easy surface...and use a harness not a collar.  Just keep saying "up...let's walk" like it is such a prize...a wonderful idea...no matter how long they belly lay..just keep up the excitement for their sake.  Do not be harsh in any way or show frustration.  It's hard for them to get used to.  It is something I do right away on the first week of getting a pup, the sooner the better.  Do not tire them out, do it for 10 min. wait 30 and then start in again.  You can have it done in 2 days time.   Next start on outside walks.  Here is the general write up I show my clients about what I will be doing and how they can help when the dog is with them.  It's for pups as well as dogs. <br>  When taking a dog out for a walk first off you need to be the pack leader.  SInce your dog does not fully understand this yet here is how you teach them.  I always use a harness no matter how large or small the dog may be.  I think pulling on a dogs throat to teach them something they will learn just as easy without that discomfort is just unnecessary.  Never give a dog full lead when on a walk when they do not have the social skills to handle that kind of freedom.  It is not fair to the dog to assume he will just act socially acceptable...they do not know what we do not teach.  This being said, potty your dog outside in your yard before you leave.  Then put on the harness/leash.  Do not give your dog any more lead than what will keep them in a heel position.  Walk and chronically tell your dog “nice walk..good job...stay with me...nice work Buster (name of your dog)”  When the leash is being strained by a over vigorous dog...just give it a tug, put him in a sit position with a stern, but not loud command.  This just helps them to get back some self control.  Remember that when a stew is being made we say “mmmm that smells good” while a dog can smell each and every ingredient put in the stew.  So while outside there are an abundance of smells that will bring on excitability.  This doesn’t mean your dog is out of control or stupid...it means there is a lot out there that dogs face (in the excite mental side) that we just do not see or think about.  Once we are aware of these it is easier to show a bit more grace/boundaries needed.  If your dog has to go potty do not let him any more than his body length away from you.  That way you are out of “shot” but he is not too far so you do not lose control.  What I usually do to help them learn to meet and greet properly is have someone I know walk by several times.  I teach them to sit then teach them to “shhhhh” no barking, no loud whining...look quietly, it’s time to observe sort of behavior.  This comes by you keeping a firm hand as well as a firm tone, not overly dramatic in any way.  Just kind of with this mind set...”this is what you need to do, this is how you will learn it, I will not give in, you will learn what I am teaching because it is for your own good”.  Sometimes that helps to just keep an even keel inside of us.  Dogs pick up on the slightest things so it is our job to only give them what they really need to learn.  If your dog seems to just not be able to  do the “sit” in a close situation just direct them further away before the sit position is taken.  For instance I do highly aggressive dogs - so I start with taking them 2 labs length away from the sidewalk and put in a sit position.  They are not allowed to stand or bark.  Barking can be a sign of aggression to another dog coming by so you want to make sure that your dog is not misunderstood.  If you continue to do this 3 days in a row for an hour walk or more...you dog will be getting the jest of it.  It takes time...but just remember that learning does take time pure and simple.  You can do this, so just keep your mind set in the direction you want to go and go.  I wish you all the luck love.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	More than anything, you should be concerned about putting her through a training class.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	puppies do tend to miss behave when they are tired. if you notice her getting crabby just put her in her bed for 30 min just like you would a with a child|`|UbXVjcm7aa	I'm no expert but I've had lots of dogs in my life and I really wouldn't worry when a dogs tired they'll sleep!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Sounds like you have a 16 month old puppy to me.<br>  <br>  If you want her to sleep more, she needs more exercise.  Right now is the PERFECT time to get her into a puppy class.  Make sure she's updated on her shots and get her signed up right away.  They'll help you through the leash stubborness.<br>  <br>  She's going to start maturing sexually soon and that makes things go kinda bonkers in the attention span department.  So NOW is the time to get in there and start really training her, while she still has a brain that will absorb information easily.  Because in two months, she's gonna go through her "teenager" time and if you don't have this basic stuff down by then, it will be twice as hard on you and the pup.|`|sW8eg01saa	you need to make it sound fun when you take her for walks and as for her sleeping will start to sleep more as she gets older but right now she is full of energy get a hot dog and chop it up and have start learning the basic tricks then go on also you should get chicken jerky they sell at pets stores and she if she likes that. i had the same problem with my dog when she was younger now she is almost two and she will walk any time i say "lets go bye bye" ( she goes nuts). good luck on training her|`|KuUx34hCaa	your puppy will get the sleep it needs AS long as she is NOT kept from sleeping when she needs to as far as the leash goes don't tug on it sit down on the floor with her while the leash is on her & you holding the L.in one hand and holding some thing she really likes eg.toy or food treat but you need to find st she really likes talk baby talk in a high pitch & say come with just enough tension on L that she can feel it if she backs take tension off then repeat & soon enough she will figure out  it's safe work in short sessions put the leash on her & let her pull it around BUT ONLY while you are there to watch her at all times so she is always safe puppies have short attention span & will lose interest in thing fast letting her sleep with you is great don't let any one tell you differently
6SeWCfUfaa	Litter mates will not have the same DNA profiles.  They'll have similar DNA because they share the same parents, but they get half of moms and half of dads DNA ... which half from each parent is a crap shoot and it's not like the parents always pass one half or another.  The halves can be sorta mixed and matched because of how DNA behaves when gametes (egg and sperm) are being formed.<br>  <br>  You can prove parentage, but unless you know for sure how old a dog is, you can't determine if the dogs are litter mates or not.  They could be siblings from different litters just as easily.  Of course if you know birthdates or have a good idea of age, you can tell that way if can identify the parents DNA.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think there are unique "markers" in DNA for every breed, which would make DNA testing for breed impossible to do.  I actually think it's a scam at the moment and not good for much more than testing for certain diseases (for which there are known markers) and proof of parentage.|`|ZkYxdlTeaa	To determine whether pups share the same father you will need a sample from the father for comparison.  There is no definitive way to determine sibship by comparing samples from just the "alleged sibs"  Mom and Dad have 2 sets of alleles and those alleles are contributed randomly to each offspring.  Thats what makes us uniquely different even from our own brothers and sisters.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	That's what "Paternity" is! You can't tell if they are from the same litter, but, you can tell if they have the same parents, making them siblings.<br>  My friend and I just did a dual sired litter, in other words, we mated our ***** with 2 different males. You wait till the pups are born then send for a DNA kit from AKC for all three "parents" and each of the pups. <br>  You swab the inside of each dog's cheek, send the swabs in to AKC and their lab runs the DNA, then you get a printout for each test, you write all three parents results on a "comparison sheet" then each pup's<br>  results are compared. Turns out our litter of 5, 4 were fathered by my little male and one was sired by the other male.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	DNA profiling ******ONLY****** proves or DIS-proves direct parentage *IF* all suspects are already profiled *&* on file!<br>  <br>  Obviously littermates w/same sire & dam will have the same profile. Those w/another sire will NOT!<br>  <br>  AKC has a program for "multiple sire" suspected litters.|`|CyFLDrgQaa	Idk <br>  probably not.why?<br>  they could be from the same mother but from a different litter<br>  im not sure what to say|`|AA12227599	Sure if you can afford it. I saw an episode of Flipping out where Jeff Lewis had his dogs tested to see what breeds they were, he got the results for a small fortune and then didn't believe they were correct. So be careful not to get ripped off.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just for the record, you don't need anyone to tell you if they are from the same litter. If they are then they would be the same age, wouldn't they???|`|5fjjsElbaa	not that i am aware of. there are 4 or 5 companies that boast they can tell you what breeds are in your pets background but i do not know that they are very good at what they do. We send out a test on a co workers mutt and it came back that she had no dominant breed in her, but was part jrt, german shepard, and had a bit of yorkie. Annie is a 35 pound black dog that looks like a collie mix. We are going to send in a pure breed dogs blood and see what happens. i'll keep you posted|`|TSc8OE4vaa	You can tell if they have the same father, but not if they are from the same litter.  If the mother and father were bred twice, you could tell all of the pups were siblings but you couldn't tell which one was in which litter.
M9o5WpOqaa	Yes!! I currently have the most wonderful rattie boys ever!!<br>  Though they all give kisses,only 2 of them are 'certified' dentists!<br>  When my daughter picks up her rat Vinnie,he instantly licks her hands,all her fingers, then her lips.Occasionally he will try to sniff the inside of her mouth and examine her teeth.He also likes to clean between her toes.My rat Dominic instantly gives me kisses and literally forces his entire head into my mouth.Sometimes he even tries to get his shoulders in there too.He sniffs every single tooth,licks my gums and tongue and is by far the most effective dentist! I try not to laugh when he does this,for fear of accidentally biting him,but I can't help it...it tickles.<br>  Santino is the groomer-he will hop onto my shoulder and ram his nose inside my ear and try to clean it out.He also licks my face,neck and cheeks,whereas his brother Moose tries to eat my eyelashes and pluck my eyebrows-no kidding!<br>  My previous rat Julian used to try and clean out my belly button and lick the back of my neck.|`|IFGSOd16aa	My rats love to nibble on my ear and brush my hair.<br>  I love them :)|`|KToEYmwWaa	My rats obsessively groom me too.  They try to clean my mouth, nostrils, ears, fingers, toes, and especially my hair.  I have very long hair and if I happen to fall asleep when they are out playing on my bed, I wake up looking like the bride of frankenstein (I wonder if that's where the term "ratting you hair" came from?)  <br>  <br>  My rats are also greedy little piglets.  They can tell the sound of the yogies bag opening and go from a dead sleep to rambunctious little beggars in a split second.  They also beg for treats and human food pretty much all the time when they are awake as well. <br>  <br>  Oh...and my youngest rat has a small plush lion toy (smaller than her) and she drags it everywhere with her.  I think she thinks it's her baby.  It is the absolute cutest thing I have ever seen.  <br>  <br>  When my oldest rat was a baby she would chase her tail. <br>  <br>  Also, he's not a rat...but when I feed my hamster yogies he immediately puts them in his food bowl.  I could feed him 5 in a row and they would go into the bowl one after another.  It's strange because usually hamsters shove treats into their pouches and go stash it somewhere.  Later, when I'm not looking, he grabs them one by one and brings them down to his little igloo.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	I love my babies. They always crawl through my hair.|`|inMfHLWoaa	A Rat Went down my top at penny-well farm and bit my boob. Humiliating.

1UfTec9Haa	Yeahh. That one is finee. Just make sure you clean the cage often and keep it fed and watered. Play with it often too. Remember that they are nocturnal which means they sleep during the day and are up for most of the night. Make sure that you have chew toys in there too, otherwise it will chew / gnaw on the wires of the cage. They also are good escape artists soo make sure that you close it tightly and safely when you are done with it.<br>  Hope I Could Help.|`|RjyNInW6aa	I personally would get a plastic cage with tubes so you can extend it or shrink it but that will be fine. make sure the igloo is the smaller one. Good luck!|`|5fjjsElbaa	you need bedding also. i advise  yesterdays news or something similar rather than any of the wood products. The ine and cedar bedding can cause breathing problems
8eSbCrQraa	I would plan on it.  We own 2 and we lucked out that one is pretty dry.  She only drools when playing (which is thick and white) or drinking.  We still have to be careful when people come around in nice clothes that she doesnt wipe slobber all over.<br>  Our other one causes us to wash walls and carry rags.  He slings slobber on the ceiling, drools constantly, and when he drinks its like most of the water and drool is outside of the bowl.<br>  <br>  So while you could luck out with one not drooling, its unlikely.  Plan on carrying rags!|`|aHi8KHj1aa	Really REALLY bad.  From personal experience (worked with them at a vet clinic for six years), it gets all over your clothes, your house, and your guests.  On top of that if the drool starts drying any dirt/dust/hair sticks to it making everything look even dirtier.  It's a bummer because mastiffs are seriously one of the sweetest breeds out there.|`|0CWWfgMdaa	DUDE. YES . it is the drool channel, all drool all the time. <br>  sweet dogs, but wear old clothing or something.<br>  ha ha haa ! ( remembering friends dog with same issue, oh man, those were funny times, his name was Z. dribbling old bastard. we loved him )|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Yeah, your would have to keep a drool rag in your back pocket|`|jxo8OSBeaa	Have you ever seen the movie "COJO"?? lol.. Well imagine a dog running around with Rabies all the time.. They are great animals if you can get past all of the slober...Gentle Giants!|`|W0buucLsaa	'Fraid so. They drool A LOT. The Mastiff that I took care of for a few months, while her owners were out of the country, used to fling drool on top of her own head when she shook it. And drool got all over my pants, every day. And all over my own dog's head.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Yes, a drool rag and a mop nearby whenever they are drinking.
dZ3B2vNIaa	At least $1,000 dollars per year.  They are prone to joint and bone problems.  They need lots of food and it needs to be the best of the best because of their energy level.  You will probably spend hundreds of dollars on exercise programs because they are very high-maintenance.  They need toys all the time because those babies CHEW!|`|W0buucLsaa	The first six months to a year are the most expensive, but the actual price depends on where you live and whether you adopt/buy. These were the first year's expenses for the labrador puppy that I adopted from a shelter, four years ago, not including the pet deposit at my apartment ($300):<br>  <br>  Adoption fee: $80<br>  Spay: FREE with adoption<br>  First vet visit: FREE with adoption<br>  First set of shots: FREE with adoption<br>  <br>  (If bought from a breeder, this would add up to $500 cost of pup plus $200 spay plus $100 for shots and vet visit)<br>  <br>  Crate: $40<br>  Bed: $20<br>  Toys and bones: $100 (estimate)<br>  Food: $200 (estimate)<br>  Second set of shots: $80<br>  Third set of shots: $80<br>  Heartworm preventative: $50<br>  Flea/tick preventative: $100<br>  <br>  So I shelled out $750. If I had bought from a breeder, I would have spent $1470. I live in a fairly low-cost-of-living area.|`|SwyZkNn6aa	We have a golden retriever who is now about 8 months old.  We got her when she was 8 weeks and cute as all hell.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to drop about 2K in the first few months with vaccinations, food, supplies, a crate, and spay/neuter.  Also, puppies can get sick.  Ours had diarrhea really bad that warranted another visit to the vet with meds, so that was another $150 down the drain.<br>  <br>  You just never know what can happen!  Also, puppy classes are a great idea.  It helps for them to be socialized early on.  You can also learn lots of great tips on potty training and basic doggie etiquette.  <br>  <br>  I'll warn you that although I wouldn't trade our dog for anything those first few months can be pretty stressful as you adjust to taking care of a new puppy.  Crate training is the key to potty training and to discourage them from destroying your house when you're not around!  I can't tell you how instrumental it was in helping us raise our puppy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!<br>  <br>  *To razzle:<br>  <br>  Since the poster is asking about a pure bred puppy, you have to factor in everything.  Madison was $500 from the breeder.  Her crate was $120.  Initial vaccinations ran upwards of $150 - 250/per visit.  Having her spayed was $450 at the vet.  Add in all the times she got sick, toys, beds, food, things we had to replace that she chewed, we VERY easily spent 2K in the first 6 months of her life.|`|NBeQyTlMaa	Excluding the cost of the dog (that just depends on where you get him from), the cost breaks down like this:<br>  <br>  Crate (for a big dog) - $100 (it will have a divider that comes with it, so it will grow with your pup)<br>  <br>  Leash - $15 - $35 (retractable leashes cost more)<br>  <br>  Collar - $5 - $15 (the smaller the collar, the cheaper it is. You will need one for when he is a pup and when he is an adult.)<br>  <br>  Dog Bowls - $2 & Up (You could actually just feed your puppy out of old tupperware bowls, but I don't recommend it. Some people spend tons of money on bowls. This is just personal preference.)<br>  <br>  *Brush - $5 - $10<br>  <br>  *Shampoo - $2 - $5<br>  <br>  *Nail Clippers - $5 - $20<br>  <br>  * - You could eleviate these expenses by taking your dog to a groomer regularly, but that could cost you a lot more.<br>  <br>  Food - $20 and up (depends on the brand and how big the bag. An adult lab probably goes through a ton of food, so this could really add up.)<br>  <br>  Vaccinations - $200 ( a puppy should be vaccinated for different things starting at the age of 6 weeks. He then is vaccinated every 3 weeks after that until he is 18 weeks old. This is the total cost approximately for all of those first four vaccinations.) <br>  <br>  Yearly Vaccination - $30 (An adult dog requires yearly rabies vaccine and something else - I can't remember the other thing. Any who - these run about $30/year. Maybe a little more expensive.)<br>  <br>  Spayed/Neuter - $70 and up. (Depends on how big the dog is and cost varies from vet to vet.)<br>  <br>  Toys & treats - $30 and up (This just depends on how many toys you get and what quality they are. The more toys a dog has, the less likely he is to chew up your house, things, etc. Also dogs needs chew bones and hard treats for their teeth.)<br>  <br>  Bed - $30 & up (again personal preference depends on expense. Even if you will be having your dog sleep with  you, he will appreciate his own bed.)<br>  <br>  I may have missed something, but I think that is the general run down of all the cost associated with a puppy. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh and I recommend trying an animal shelter for one before you pay too much to a breeder. Animal shelters often spay/neuter your dog for you, update them on appropriate shots for their age range, and you will be saving a life! However, not all shelters will do this. My most recent dog I got from the a shelter did not offer these services. <br>  <br>  * I read some of the comments before mine. I have a 10 year old chihuahua and a puppy and have had dogs my whole life - I have NEVER spent $1,000/ year on an animal. And my dogs are spoiled rotten - clothes, blankets, beds, etc. As far as the $2,000 initial cost, I can't figure out how you could spend that much on a puppy. When I got my latest one, I spent probably $300 - $500 TOTAL for the first few months - all inclusive, neuter, cost of the dog, shots, and everything listed above.
6f1d6bb560584bdbd9ef104f6b599c85aa	My husband is like that with all animals. Seriously, we've had wounded wild animals come to our door and let him treat them (ie: a oil-slicked duck from the river, a raccoon that had been shot with an arrow, a screech owl that almost drowned in a neighbors 50 gl drum of water after chasing a chipmunk into it). We have a pony and chickens that follow him around like he's their god. Our African Grey, while she loves me will fly off to him at the sound of his voice. When she's in her room and wants attention she calls out in a mournful voice "Daaaaaave". Some people are just born Dr. Doolittles I guess.|`|vMByDy1raa	I think it has to due to the people inter peace.  They aren't upset or setting off bad vibes.  They have a more pleasant voice and aren't all nervous or afraid of the bird.   I know they don't seem to like people who smoke, my daughter smokes only outside and all birds are very weary with her.  Maybe they can tell who has love to give them.  These are just guesses.  All birds seem to like me and my little boy.  Birds are a little more weary of my husband.  Birds are not sure of my daughter.    My granddaughter is afraid so they can't trust her.|`|v6coHbIeaa	I think they know you love them I rehab birds and they do me the same way.I get bit but the birds i get no one wants because they are so mean. I will have over there bitting in two or three days.They know if you love them or not.Just like a cat dog. Keep it up sound good.|`|GenpGk7Daa	I wish I knew. Its the same way with me and rats. they obsess over me when I fist meet them. if you find the answer to your question, I would like to know. Maybe animals are physic and can read our feelings and emotions? Or maybe it has to do with when we were born... I was born in the Year of The Rat....|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Its hard to say. Perhaps they see something in your personality that they pick up on and like. Maybe its the way you (we) react to them that they like. Their keen eyesight and intelligence, makes them very perceptive animals.
gU34xa9vaa	Your female kitten has brought back memories of your male's neutering, to him.Cats remember things and he will be able to smell the scents of the vet's surgery on her. <br>  I think he was more 'loving' while she was away because he missed her and was feeling a bit clingy and confused and wondering where she'd gone.<br>  Things will settle down in a few days, don't worry,they'll soon be good pals again.|`|DtkLsetkaa	It will pass.  She smells "different" for now because of all the sick animals at the vet, and he doesn't recognize her scent.  It will go back to normal after she has cleaned herself a bit and gotten her own scent back.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	first of all keep them separated for a few days to allow her a quiet recovery time.<br>  <br>  very simple. new scents cat doesn't recognize the fixed cat. i am a little surprised the vet didn't mention that when you picked her up. <br>  <br>  don't need to worry. get a warm wash cloth and wipe the fixed cat down to remove new odors. they will stop.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	She smells like the Vet, sterilizing agents, and probably anesthesia too. I'd keep them separate for two days, then let them see each other. He will adapt again, don't worry.|`|PWdPTH8paa	the kitten calling the other kitten "no balls"|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Most likely he is reacting to her odd scent. Cats recognize each other more by scent than appearance and she doesn't smell "right" because she has anesthesia and medicine in her system and hospital odors on her coat. <br>  <br>  This is a common problem and usually only temporary. It may help to clean her with a shampoo wipe to get rid of some of the vet smell. You can also try wiping a dry washcloth on the corners of his lips and then wiping the same part of the cloth onto her head or shoulders. This "marks" her with his pheromones so he knows that she is okay and belongs.|`|OlMNQCPPaa	It's her smell.  She smells like the vet and he doesn't like it.  This will pass in time.
HYpEOdsraa	I always advise my new puppy owners to bring a large towel and plenty of kitchen roll or tissues with them when they come to collect their new  puppy.   It is better to have someone with you so they can place the puppy on the towel on their lap while you drive or vice versa.  The puppy needs to feel secure throughout the journey.   It will probably be a little car sick so ask the Breeder not to give it a meal just before you pick it up.   Keep the tissues nearby in case you need them.<br>  <br>  You will find that the puppy may not want to eat much the first day so don't force it to eat.  Just keep her quiet and let her get used to her new surroundings.  It is very daunting for a tiny pup to leave her mother and litter brothers and sisters and she will take a while to adjust to her new surroundings.<br>  <br>  I like my puppies to take a small piece of fleece with them which I have previously rubbed over the Dam and the rest of the litter.  This will help her to settle if she has the familiar scent around her.  You could ask the breeder if she would do this for you or take your own piece of bedding and get her to use that.<br>  <br>  Buy her a nice big cuddly toy which she can snuggle up to in her bed.<br>  She is bound to miss the warmth of her litter mates and won't feel so lonely at night.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new puppy.I hope everything goes smoothly for you.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	An hour is really not that long of a drive especially for a puppy.  Your dog will probably sleep most of the way home.  You should bring a long a crate just in case.  Also you will want a collar and a leash.  If there is someone in the passenger seat that can hold the dog that would be best.  Bring a blanket for the dog to lay on in your lap and maybe a couple of treats.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	Do not let him look out the window.  In august I drove 1 hour and 45 minutes to get my mini dachshund.  My husband made the mistake of letting him look out the window and the poor puppy puked.  It stunk so bad, but it was so funny.  My other mini dachshund loves to look out the window.  But not all dogs do.  Also, when it started smelling like poo, we stopped to let the dog go to the bathroom.|`|52162133e9e06553229902bb43a5182caa	I would suggest a small crate to make her feel more secure.  Be sure to bring some towels to mop up any possible messes.  She may either pee/poop, or get car sick.  I remember bringing a puppy home once, and she was car sick the whole way home.  So, you want to be prepared for all that.|`|CyFLDrgQaa	If this is the puppy's first trip in a car, the strange sights, sounds, and smells can be frightening. Take some time to let your new puppy get her bearings before you head for home.<br>  <br>  Cover your lap and upholstery with a towel or sheet<br>  Even after you've taken every precaution, puppies can get carsick so be prepared.<br>  <br>  Keep the car ride quiet and relaxed<br>  If your puppy whines or cries, don't punish her or be overly affectionate. Pet her softly.Let her know there is nothing to be scared of. If your puppy gets too noisy or unruly,put her in the crate until shes calme down(not for to long tho). This area is den-like .<br>  <br>  For longer trips, stop for bathroom breaks and stretching<br>  Remember to keep your puppy away from areas frequented by other dogs. Until she's been vaccinated, your puppy is susceptible to numerous diseases. If you plan to bring your puppy home in a crate, have the breeder introduce her to it a few days before you pick her up.|`|AcxGPyG5aa	For the puppies safety get your self a travel cage and put it in the car to bring home the puppy a lot safer than having it sit in your lap in case of another careless driver. Being in a wreck it protects the puppy from being flung around and will be found sooner. Also check with your car insurance to see if they have a pet policy attachment for your pet in the car it provides vet care in a car accident.|`|mnufOa6eaa	The other poster is correct, an hour really is nothing. I live in one state but the breeder of my first dog lives in another. Me and my mom(went with me) drove to Wisconsin in January in the middle of a snowstorm to get my puppy. This drive to and back was over an hour. Just make sure to take at least one potty break for the puppy. You get the dog used to car rides as a puppy, it's more likely going to love getting in the car as an adult.|`|sgEazAn2aa	Bring chew toys and a small comfortable crate for the dog. If the dog cries don't yell at it or handle it  because its in this thing that it has never ben in and its separated from all its Brothers and sisters and its Just scared. So if it cries try to distract it from talking to it or music. And most likely he will fall asleep somewhere lol good luck.|`|5be7a973e29ac4dabecf90b0f3f3739eaa	i would keep the puppy on your lap and not in a cage it will make the ride go smoother and give the puppy puppy treats or a toy...most likely the puppy will sleep well at least all mine did i havae had 5 dogs that we all got as puppies and that worked the best|`|KjVKNjwNaa	also make sure you take a wash cloth or something similar to rub on the other puppies & mom/dad if they are there...just to give your pup a sense of still being around his environment he has been used to!|`|qapJU3tMaa	An hour's drive is nothing.

It would also make sense  to carry on some blankets, and lots  of rags/tissues for some 'marking'. goodluck with your dog and hope you have fun with him!<br>  <br>  Here's also a good  source of info.<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t4v.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/t4v.html</a>|`|AA10356572	make sure the breeder knows what time you are coming so they dont feed the pup right before hand.. and have them give you a small bag of food so the pup is on the same food it is used to for a while if you are going to change it.. change it slowly<br>  <br>  here is a link called<br>  Bringing Home a Puppy<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Bringing-Home-a-Puppy.202265" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Bringing-Ho...</a>

We have a horse, and 3 cats, and 2 dogs.  <br>  <br>  From the beginning we taught our dogs NO, when they attempted to chase anything, and praised them for coming back.  They soon learned that all the animals have a right to be in the yard together without any conflicts.  Even the neighbourhood dogs that visit know this about our critters.  Be consistant.  Reward with positive words and actions.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	If you are interested in training your dog, a really great book is Karen Pryor's "Don't Shoot the Dog". <br>  <br>  Basically reward your dog when we leaves them alone, scold him when he goes near them. Positive reinforcer/negative reinforcer.<br>  <br>  It's basically the same as training a dog to come to you when called. He will come willingly because he knows that by doing so he will be rewarded.|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	Don't worry about it.  It's my understanding that a peacock can be a pretty mean b*stard.....so with that, I'd say your little boxer will probably learn on his own to leave that sucker alone.  And as far as cats go...they've got some pretty nasty claws to protect themselves with.  I'd save my money, and instead of sending Sparky for training, I'd put it on the Peacock!!!
