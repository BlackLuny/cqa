I was thinking about going with the Friday the 13th theme... But he has a thing about getting older already. I do not want to make it all doom and gloom....

We are only going to be there for a couple of hours before we all go out, but I do want to have some drinks and appetizers there. Any ideas will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

(malignant hypertensive (inherited) and gerd, ibs all that b.s... blah blah, you've heard it all before...)   but my vegan buds were all going on about their processed vegan garbage...      so...   there's a vegan alternative to "feta cheese"   oh?   is that so?      thoughts?  ideas?  references?         thanks.. just curious as hell!      no no, i'm not one of those vegans...  i just find it impossible to believe there's an animal free  'feta cheese".

20090307145727AACF3WH	Food & Drink;Entertaining	Should I invite them to my party?	So I'm thinking about having a party (and plz dont say anything about my house being trashed, b/c I've taken that into consideration) So I'm a little low on ppl to invite. So I hang out with a group at school, but I never hang out with them outside of school. Would it be okay to invite them like there cool ppl and stuff but I don't normally hang out with them outside of school for some strange reason.   Another thing is would it be alright to invite some ppl I haven't seen in 5 months, every time I hang out with them almost I get a little screwed around b/c of some things, but there cool ppl to party with through so I haven't called them up in a long time b/c of me getting screwed around through.   I just need some extra input.
