In cement, this involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles, and other components of the concrete, to form a solid mass.<br>  Four compounds are usually regarded as the major constituents of cement. These are:<br>  Tricalcium silicate C3S, Dicalcium silicate C2S, Tricalcium Aluminate C3A and tetracalcium Aluminoferrite C4AF. The two main calcium silicates are the main cementitious compounds in cement.|`|AwKsLPsBaa	Concrete is the final product.

2ef5ca5a39098769a8dac8a2f3c15f57aa	Vapor pressure is given.  There is no need to calculate it.  Vapor pressure is a function of temperature.  <br>  <br>  For questions a and b, I am not sure if you are asking for the vapor pressure of each component in the liquid phase or the partial pressure of each component in the vapor phase.<br>  <br>  a. Vapor pressure = 345 torr  The partial pressure = 165, see below.<br>  b. Vapor pressure = 295 torr  The partial pressure = 154, see below.<br>  c. You must calculate the mole fraction of each component.  the molecular weight of acetone is 58.08.  The moles of acetone is 33.0/58.08 = 0.568.<br>  <br>  The molecular weight of chloroform is 119.38.  The moles of chloroform is 74.0/119.38 = 0.620.<br>  <br>  The partial pressure of acetone = 0.568/(0.568+0.620) x 345 = 165.<br>  The partial pressure of chloroform = 0.620/(0.568+0.620) x 295 = 154.<br>  <br>  The total pressure is 165 + 154 = 319.<br>  <br>  This assumes that the liquid mixture is ideal.  Most likely, it is not.  To calculate this exactly, you must know the interactions between the dissimilar molecules in the liquid solution.

JEmuZTiuaa	The two words describe different properties.<br>  <br>  A weak acid is an acid such as ethanoic acid that only dissociates into H+(aq) ions and an anion to a small extent when it is dissolved in water. (A strong acid, such as H2SO4, is one which is essentially fully dissociated when it is added to water.)<br>  <br>  A concentrated acid contains a large number of moles of the acid (whether or not it is weak or strong) in the solution, whereas a dilute acid contains a low(er) number of moles of the acid in the solution.<br>  <br>  So you can make a dilute or concentrated solution of an acid by adding more or less water.  You can't affect whether the acid is strong or weak, though, that is a property of that particular acid.<br>  <br>  OK?|`|118h96Q8aa	This was a pretty complicated question, which I misread first. At first glance, I thought you were asking how an acid could be concentrated and diluted at the same time and I was thinking, it can't. Because it can't! XD<br>  <br>  However, that's obviously not what you're asking. It is possible for a concentrated acid to be weak. <br>  <br>  Acid concentration is defined as how many acid molecules there are per unit volume in the liquid. Or how many H+ ions, a proton, are donated by the molecules in a unit volume. A strong concentrated acid will readily give up it's protons. However, a weak concentrated acid will not easily give up it's protons, even if there are a lot. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|RAD9LLGcaa	Its used in different ways =S<br>  x|`|ZzOiOmxvaa	If it's not diluted and has a pH of say 6.5 then it's a very weak acid.|`|SYZQZGesaa	Its all ph levels.

Citric acid is weak acid (used in drinks and food), while Sulfuric Acid is strong acid and can dissolve metal and disfigure your skin.<br>  <br>  Concentration just means how much water is in acid.

AA10811674	Whenever you measure distances on land or in space you need at least one length (baseline) of the triangle and the angle to the object you are looking at from each end of the baseline. With a short baseline there will be very little difference in the measured angles from either end., and less accuracy. With a much longer baseline there with be a greater angle that is much easier to read. So in measuring distances to stars, you take 2  readings 6 months apart when the eartyh is at opposite points in its orbit which gives you the maximum baseline. However since distances to the stars are so great, it works with relatively close stars. Pretty much anything further out is estimated by its brightness.

6mOOskuBaa	simply because you've added more energy to the act than is absorbed by the ball or the surface off of which it is bouncing so the elasticity of the ball causes it to bounce higher than the starting point|`|1c635f446d91828fc99f4dc9a1a95a3baa	This doesn't always happen but when it does, that means enough force was applied to it by the time it hit the ground and enough of the reflected force was returned to send the ball higher than when it started.  Examples of this occurring may be a very high start point that allows the ball to reach a high velocity and due to gravity's pull, the ball may gain enough force for the high bounce.  Also, an initially high amount of energy applied to the ball (thrusting the ball down with your arm and hand) may cause this to occur.|`|kB63WTfdaa	The force applied is greater than the balls initial potential energy and the friction of impacting the ground.
ghiXastzaa	You are correct by using integration by parts; however you must do it multiple times.    integral sin(x)e^x dx  u=sin(x) du=cos(x)  dv=e^x v=e^x    integral sin(x)e^x dx = sin(x)e^x- integral e^x*cos(x) dx    Now you must do integration by parts again:    integral e^x*cos(x) dx  u=cos(x) du=-sin(x)  dv=e^x v=e^x    integral e^x*cos(x) dx= cos(x)e^x -integral -sin(x)e^x dx    Now you can solve the equation because you now have like terms (integral -sin(x)e^x dx)    Your whole equation is:    integral sin(x)e^x dx = sin(x)e^x- (cos(x)e^x +integral sin(x)e^x dx)    Which equals:    integral sin(x)e^x dx = sin(x)e^x-cos(x)e^x -integral sin(x)e^x dx    You now add the integral sin(x)e^x dx to each side and recieve     2(integral sin(x)e^x dx) = sin(x)e^x-cos(x)e^x    Divide by 2 and get    (sin(x)e^x-cos(x)e^x+C)/2|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	Personally, I'd use Euler's formula and write sin(x) as (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2i.

QPB6e3lVaa	You left off the "passing on genes" part. The "majorly flawed" still do not pass on their genes. I liken the medical science participation in this as being much like the housing industry. If we did not have houses, those who could not stand the cold would surely die. So, is the housing industry saving people with genetic deficiencies to withstand cold? Should those of us be allowed to die off? <br>  <br>  My neighbor's daughter was born 35 years ago. She has not developed mentally past one week old, even though her body has. Her brother is quite normal in every way, his genes will be passed on, hers will not. Medical help was needed to keep her alive, but just because she was not allowed to die does not affect the gene pool.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	Yes it does make one wonder if we are controlling evolution. I suppose we should consider since intelligence is an evolved trait, it is natural behaviour for humans to allow genetic deficiencies into the gene pool, and therefore this too is ultimately down to evolution. <br>  <br>  Homo sapiens is quite a puny species compared to the other apes. Is this because over time, we have used our intelligence to protect and nurture the weaker members of our species? I would point out though,  it's brain power that's most important to mankind, and it seems to me  genetic deficiencies of a mental kind are filtered out, and humans become ever brighter.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Yes.

ajzq5nKIaa	Okay, it's not -that- complex, but I find it illuminating to provide my thinking so you can see -why- it is true as well.<br>  First of all, we need the number of routes between what we'll call (1, 1) and (i , j), a general point on the grid. [Note here that (i, j) means i point up and j points along - not vice versa as we may expect from Cartesian geometry - just in case there's confusion.] Now we know that a 'valid route' can be defined as a series of steps, either up (increases p by 1) or right (increases q by 1), but no more than i steps up or j steps right. Let's represent this as a general string of binary bits, where 0 means go up and q means go right. that means all the valid routes from (0, 0) to (p, q) can be expressed as all the binary strings, length i + 1 - (j + 1) = i + j - 2, with i 0s and j 1s; or in other terms, all the combinations we can form out of i 0s and j 1s. Think about this: define the route as a1*a2*a3*...*a(i + j - 2), then the valid string are just the number of ways of choosing i - 1 of these (i + j - 2) numbers to be 0 instead of 1. This number is just<br>  <br>  (i + j - 2)C(i - 1), i.e. (i + j - 2) choose (i - 1), which is<br>  <br>  (i + j - 2)!/((i - 1)!*(i + j - 2 - i + 1)!)<br>  <br>  = (i + j - 2)!/((i - 1)!*(j - 1)!).<br>  <br>  [Note the symmetry in i and j; this reflects the symmetry of the choice of elements; i.e. that we could have chosen to swap the definitions of 0 and 1 in 'up' and 'right' if we'd wanted.]<br>  <br>  So, in the same way, the number of routes going from (1, 1) to (p, q) is<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)!/((p - 1)!*(q - 1)!).<br>  <br>  So... how do we use these? Well, for each route going from (1, 1) to (i, j), there is another set of routes leading from (i, j) to (p, q) which we can't take. By the formula, there are<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2 - (i + j - 2)!/((p - 1 - (i - 1))!*((q - 1) - (j - 1))!)<br>  <br>  = (p + q - i - j)!/((p - i)!*(q - j)!)<br>  <br>  routes from (i, j) to (p, q). Hence the routes that are disallowed are all pairs of routes from (1, 1) to (i, j) and from (i, j) to (p, q); therefore their number is<br>  <br>  = [(i + j - 2)!/((i - 1)!*(j - 1)!)]*[(p + q - i - j)!/((p - i)!*(q - j)!)];<br>  <br>  and hence the number of routes avoiding (i, j), is just the total number of routes subtract this figure, which gives as your final answer,<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)!/((p - 1)!*(q - 1)!) - [(i + j - 2)!/((i - 1)!*(j - 1)!)]*[(p + q - i - j)!/((p - i)!*(q - j)!)]<br>  <br>  which probably simplifies down a bit with algebra; or is also expressible as<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)C(p - 1) - (i + j - 2)C(i - 1)*(p + q - i - j)C(p - i). [1]<br>  <br>  I have checked this for several cases, and it works for all the examples I've tried.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please note the importance of including the (p + q - i - j)C(p - i) term, since if the formula were just<br>  <br>  (p + q - 2)C(p - 1) - (i + j - 2)C(i - 1), [2]<br>  <br>  we'd get the wrong answer even for the simplest non-trivial case - the 2 x 2 square.<br>  <br>  Consider the 2 by 2 square, so let (p, q) = (3, 3), and let the centre point be disallowed - i.e., (i, j) = (2, 2). Then with [2], we count<br>  <br>  (3 + 3 - 2)C(3 - 1) - (2 + 2 - 2)C(2 - 1)<br>  <br>  = 4C2 - 2C1 = 6 - 2 = 4 valid routes, where it can be easily checked there are only 2 valid routes ({up, up right, right} or {right, right, up up}.) Note however that with the first formula [1], we get<br>  <br>  (3 + 3 - 2)C(3 - 1) - (2 + 2 - 2)C(2 - 1)*(2 + 2 - 2)C(2 - 1)<br>  <br>  = 4C2 - 2C1*2C1 = 6 - 4 = 2 - correct. This can be checked for quite a few cases.<br>  <br>  It may seem logical to take all routes from (1, 1) to (p, q), and then simply subtract the routes from (1, 1) to (i, j), but doing this we ignore that fact that each route that goes through (i, j) disallows not just 1 route but the number of all possible routes from (i, j) to (p, q).<br>  <br>  NB Added afterwards:<br>  <br>  Sorry if this is going too far or merely incredibly long-winded and self-indulgent, but I couldn't help trying to generalise to what would happen if 'n' points were disallowed...<br>  <br>  For ease of use, let O = (1, 1) (our origin), R = (p, q) (our endpoint), and N(A1, A2) mean the number of routes from point A1(x1, y1) to point A2(x2, y2), so that<br>  <br>  N(A1, A2) = (x2 + y2 - x1 - y1)!/((x2 - x1)!*(y2 - y1)!)<br>  <br>  Let's say we have 2 disallowed points P1 = (i1, j1) and P2 = (i2, j2). We shall have two different cases for if P1 and P2 can be joined in a valid string in the first place. If not, call the points 'mutually exclusive' (NB - this means point P1 will be above and/or to the left of P2), and in the case of 2 mutually exclusive points, we'd have<br>  <br>  [Number of valid routes] = N(O, R) - N(O, P1)*N(P1, R) - N(O, P2)*N(P2, R),<br>  <br>  since we'll not have to take into account any paths containing both P1 and P2.<br>  <br>  If P1 and P2 are not mutually exclusive (i.e. P1 and P2 can be joined in a valid route, so that P1 lies neither above nor to the right of P2), we have to take the total routes, and remove the routes that go through P1, and the ones that go through P2, but we have to -add on- one set of routes that go through both. If we count all routes that go through each point exactly once, we shall have counted the routes that go through both points twice. So then we get:<br>  <br>  [Number of valid routes] = N(O, R) - N(O, P1)*N(P1, R) - N(O, P2)*N(P2, R) + N(O, P1)*N(P1, P2)*N(P2, R).<br>  <br>  Note this reduces to the previous formula in the case of P1, P2 mutually exclusive, since then N(P1, P2) = 0.<br>  <br>  For three points P1, P2, P3 using this logic, the number of valid routes becomes<br>  <br>  N(O, R) - N(O, P1)*N(P1, R) - N(O, P2)*N(P2, R) - N(O, P3)*N(P3, R) + N(O, P1)*N(P1, P2)*N(P2, R) + N(O, P1)*N(P1, P3)*N(P3, R) + N(O, P2)*N(P2, P3)*N(P3, R) + N(O, P1)*N(P1, P2)*N(P2, P3)*N(P3, R).<br>  <br>  Can we spot a pattern? This is actually very hard to express in a finite formula, but I will make some definitions to try and express it: say we have n disallowed points, called P1, P2... Pn, and let O be renamed P0 and R be renamed P(n + 1). Let Dn = {Pi : 0 <= i <= n + 1} be the set of all of these, and let Tn be the set of subsets of distinct pairs of elements of Dn; so that each element of Tn is in the form {Pa, Pb}, for a < b. (Call Tn(k) the kth element of Tn). Now define something we'll call a 'stroll', Sm, of length m + 2, which is an ordered set of m + 2 elements of Tn such that:<br>  <br>  1) Sm(1) is in the form {P0, Pk} for some k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n;<br>  2) Sm(m + 2) is in the form {Pk, P(n + 1)} for some 1 ≤ j ≤ n;<br>  3) (Sm(k - 1) = {Pa, Pb} iff Sm(k) = {Pb, Pc}) for all a, b and c such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n and all k such that 2 ≤ k ≤ m + 2.<br>  <br>  (Note that Sm(k) is the kth element stroll of length m + 2, and that all the routes which correspond to one of the strolls constitute the whole of the set of our disallowed routes - in particular, the whole set of strolls of length i, or {Si(k) : 1 <= k <= i + 2}, represents every route that begins at P0, goes through i disallowed points, and then goes to P(n + 1).)<br>  <br>  Now, we could give the formula for the number of routes with n disallowed points as:<br>  <br>  N(P0, P(n + 1)) + sum(from i = 1 to n - 1)[(-1)^i*sum(over all S in {Si})[product(j = 1 to m + 1)[N(Si(j))]]]<br>  <br>  ... in other words, the total number of paths from beginning to end, minus (for odd i, or plus for even i, due to the strange nature of the overlaps) the sum over the 'length' of a disallowed stroll of (the sum over all strolls of that length of (the product of the number of paths given between each consecutive pair of points in the stroll)).<br>  <br>  I think this is correct, but it would be good if someone confirmed my logic :)|`|S8H5yYcoaa	Going only north and east, any route will go east from 1st to qth, so (q-1) streets, and will go north from 1st to pth, (p-1) streets, for a total path length of q-1 + p-1 = q+p-2.

Power is (naively) the product of current and voltage, but resistance losses are proportional to current SQUARED.? Stepping up to high voltage cuts the current and thus the losses; even trying to distribute 110 volts for several miles would require wires so heavy you would go broke paying for all the copper.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much what Edison's DC systems did; he had local power stations all over the place, and they used lots and lots of heavy wires; worse, the voltage delivered to the far end of the network was substantially less than near the stations, so customers were paying for more power than they were getting.? When Westinghouse got Tesla's AC system into the market, all it took was changing a tap on a transformer to put the voltage where it ought to be, and the lower losses of the higher-voltage distribution system reduced the problem in the first place.|`|cWuumdy7aa	The difference between AC electricty and DC electricity is that the electrons flow in one direction with DC power. <br>  <br>  Electrons have negative (?) electrical charges. Since opposite charges attract, they will move toward an area consisting of positive (+) charges. This movement is made easier in an electrical conductor, such as a metal wire.<br>  <br>  With DC electricity, connecting a wire from the negative (?) terminal of a battery to the positive (+) will cause the negative charged electrons to rush through the wire to the positive charged side. The same thing happens with a DC generator, where the motion of coiled wire through a magnetic field pushes electrons out of one terminal and attracts electrons to the other terminal.<br>  <br>  With an AC generator, a slightly different configuration alternates the push and pull of each generator terminal. Thus the electricity in the wire moves in one direction for a while and then reverses its direction when the generator armature is in a different position.|`|SYZQZGesaa	It doesn't require all the repeaters that dc does.

Increasing voltage reduces current, thereby reducing the size conductors required to transmit large blocks of power, and also minimizes losses.  Lower voltages are desired at the point of consumption because of safety and convenience.<br>  <br>  With DC, the advantages of higher voltage (smaller conductors, lower losses) and lower voltages (safety and convenience) are also present, but there is no convenient way to change the voltage with DC.  That's the main reason that all-DC systems are not used.<br>  <br>  DC does offer two advantages over AC - with AC, the maximum distance that power can be transmitted is limited by two factors.  Obviously, one is losses.  But a more limiting factor is that the maximum magnitude of power transfer is governed by the phasor angle between the sending and receiving voltages - that angle physically cannot exceed 90 degrees, and as a practical matter can not be allowed to exceed about 30 degrees without jeopardizing the ability to the system to respond to contingencies.  With DC, there is no angular limitation, only a limitation based on losses.<br>  <br>  That angular concern comes about because of the need to maintain synchronism across an AC system.  The second advantage of DC is that there is no need to maintain synchronism, and in fact DC can readily be used to interconnect systems that are not in synchronism (for example, the State of Texas is not in synchronism with anyone else - and that goes beyond politics - and is interconnected with the rest of North America via high voltage DC.  It is also possible to interconnect systems that are operating at different frequencies using DC - for example, the Amtrak rail system between Washington DC and New York is a 25 Hz system, and is interconnected to the rest of the grid via either DC or special rotating frequency converters.|`|PDcnXgE6aa	First of both AC and DC both are used in large transmission lines<br>  <br>  1. normally we prefer AC because easy to change the voltage level as our desired value by using transformer .........which is not possible in dc<br>  2.

a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	It may not be one of lifes deepest mysteries, but as scientific conundrums go, it has a peculiar staying power. Why is yawning contagious?    Researchers recently found that yawning isnt only catching among people; it is also among chimpanzees. No one has devised a fully convincing explanation of why.    Compounding the mystery is the odd way in which the contagious power of yawning is largely unconscious. We can see someone yawn, yearn to replicate the action ourselves, and do it, all without thinking about it. Other times were aware it is happening, though it still floats somewhere beneath the realm of reason and of purposeful actions.    So what gives? In an effort to find the answer, the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other peoples actions.    This circuitry is called the mirror-neuron system, because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing.     Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed.    Brain activity associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural actsrather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding, wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre Jlich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage.    But if seeing someone yawn doesnt activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added.    Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another persons yawn, the stronger was this deactivation.     This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness, the researchers wrote.    Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said.    One thing seems clear from the study is that contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding, wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an automatically released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern, or sequence of physical actions.    In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas based on the amount of oxygen being used up there. The volunteers were later asked how strongly they had been tempted to yawn while viewing the pictures.    Apart from the physical brain mechanisms of yawn contagiousness, researchers have offered different reasons as to why it exists. Some have proposed that in early humans, yawn contagiousness might have helped people communicate their alertness levels to each other, and thus coordinate their sleep schedules.    This might be part of a more general phenomenon of unconscious signals that serve to synchronize group behavior, the authors of the Neuroimage paper wrote. Such synchronization could be essential for species survival and works without action understanding, like when a flock of birds rises to the air as soon as the first bird does sosupposably as it notices a predator.|`|xNhNRJrBaa	yawning is an involuntary reflex, which means you do it without thinking about it. you usually yawn when you are tired and your body isn't working as efficiently as usual. Your brain feels it isn't getting enough oxygen, so it triggers the yawning reflex. In comes a big gulp of air to provide the oxygen your brain needs. If you  you it's time for bed. this doesn't why you will often yawn if someone Else does. Nobody knows for sure why yawns are catchy- so catchy in fact that even reading about it can make you so-o-o sleepy....Zzz Zzz|`|pFBaMlI8aa	yes you are right - people yawn because when you are inactive for a while, you don't take enough oxygen into your lungs as you need. when you yawn, it forces you to take a deep breath of air that fills your entire lung - all the way down to the bottom. when you don't take in enough oxygen as you should, the alveoli (little air sacs in your lungs) at the bottom of your lung start to collapse from lack of oxygen. your brain responds to this by making your body yawn, and sometimes sigh (sighing has the same purpose).     no one knows why yawning is contagious, but there are several likely theories. one of which is that yawning is a sign to signal tiredness, and that you should go to sleep. although, you can yawn in the middle of the day just because you're bored and not because you want to go to sleep (even though you might feel like it right then). another theory is that seeing someone yawn and then yawning yourself is a sign of empathy (as in you know what it is like to be tired/bored) and you yawn yourself. looking at a tired person will make you tired for a few seconds, and this is what might trigger the contagious yawn. also, seeing a tired person might remind you of sleep, and you might suddenly have the urge to sleep, thus also being a possible trigger of yawning.    all of these are just theories, none of them proven or contradicted. it may be that none of these are right, but all of them are possible.|`|AA11404315	Hi Libby,        Compounding the mystery is the odd way in which the contagious power of yawning is largely unconscious.

4hsc6mUuaa	I think the best way to present the information would be through a powerpoint because it's easily made and it keeps your presentation organized.    Or if you want, try a poster visual; something big, colorful, and simple for the eye to follow.    Also, try to do things in "blocks" as in: teach them one aspect of your presentation for maybe 5-10 minutes and then do a class activity that focuses on what they just learned for another 5-10 minutes. Continue that cycle until you're finished.     For the class activity, split the class in half and have each side competing with each other for a candy prize at the end. You could do a jeapardy-style game or anything similar.     Also, it'll be a good idea to print out a simplified outline of your notes on food webs and energy flow for everyone in the class to have.     Hope this helps and good luck!

Let me know how you make progress and how your career goes, it's been a while since I've met many people interested in these fields. There aren't as many publicly advertised challenges as there used to be.
YYLybWHSaa	There are a large number of theories related to the loss of body hair.<br>  1 - Some link the development of eccrine thermo-regulating sweat glands led to the loss of hair and coevolved with a larger brain. A really constant internal environment was  of prime importance in evolving the brain and its energy uses. This means both energy delivery to the brain and temperature regulation inside the brain. Hair would interfere with the fine tuning of the body's internal temperature that is possible with sweat & shivering. The problem is why have no other mammals evolved this hairlessness + sweating for savannah survival. Could the speed of heat loss be a factor? Hair slows the movement of air across the surface so slows the rate of cooling. So the loss of the hair may be for faster convection of heat away from the body.<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/gdvbqz/mh/m9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/gdvbqz/mh/m9.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/199612/0158.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/199612/0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/mol-evol/1996-November/005012.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/mol-evol/19...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r25946621680811l/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/r259...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape...</a><br>  <br>  2-Others link it to skin parasites based on the divergence of hair lice from clothing lice. Hair had come to harbor too many parasites so those individuals with less body hair carried fewer parasites and were fitter. It is assumed clothing followed the hair loss and that the lice diverged to inhabit the new clothes immediately after. (However if we shed the hair to loose the lice it failed since we just got them back in the clothes.) Also if parasite load was sufficient to remove a skin covering we would see it appear repeatedly in evolution.<br>  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/human-evolution/dn3807-early-humans-lost-hair-to-beat-bugs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/channel/bein...</a><br>  Is there fossil evidence of hair recession & loss?<br>  <a href="http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/punbb/viewtopic.php?pid=1405" rel="nofollow">http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/punbb/vi...</a><br>  <br>  3-Some think that the rise in skin pigmentation to block UV damage was the cause not the result of hair loss.|`|AA11513203	>"What is the evolutionary explanation for human hair."<br>  <br>  See Sunil's great answer.<br>  <br>  >"I have never seen a ape with long hair on its head."<br>  Now you have: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sdz3/Orangutan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sdz...</a><br>  <br>  >"Both start growing shortly after birth but beards don't start growing until adolescence.  Beards are rougher and only men have them. testosterone is the given explanation for beards but whats the evolutionary purpose?"<br>  <br>  Sexual selection.  There are some characteristics that start out as side effect of the Y-chromosome difference between males and females ... this determines the different hormones that get triggered at various stages of development, and have secondary effects such as production of facial hair that don't have any direct purpose, or survival advantage.  The "evolutionary purpose" of secondary sexual characteristics (things that aren't absolutely necessary for reproduction, but are associated with gender difference) are just to let males and females of a species recognize each other.  And what will often happen is that mates will choose each other depending on how pronounced these features are.  (Why do male birds have such colorful plumage?  Because those males that have it just do better with the females of the species.)   So those individuals whose differences appeal most to the opposite sex will tend, on average, reproduce more.   So slowly the differences get stronger and stronger.  That is sexual selection.|`|AA10783710	The theory of evolution, as written by Darwin, is riddled with holes and is full of paradoxes.<br>  <br>  For example, Darwin states that evolution strives to create a more fit plant or animal.  But that most definitely does not explain the intermediary steps nor why an animal that is already thriving would start changing into something else.  If a bat is the descendent of a rat, then the theory falls flat because having stubby flightless wings, the first stages of the evolution, would render the poor beast far less competitive.  Those wings would make him an easy target for faster prey.<br>  <br>  So some things simply do not make sense.<br>  <br>  I think that sometimes things just happen without any master plan.  There is no governing purpose.  It's just the result of chance circumstances.  We developed hair in part to protect ourselves from the cold, and underarm hair supposedly was to transmit scent.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm glad you have met only women who don't have beards.  I've never seen a woman with a real beard, but I've seen ones that had a moustache Salvador Dali would have admired !|`|Mjl0X0SCaa	This may or may not have anything to do with your question, but there is a difference between fur and hair.  Hair continues to grow, fur grows to a specific length and then falls off.  The hair on your arm is really fur.  Why do we have hair on our heads and not fur like apes, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Beards are secondary sexual characteristics (like breasts) and grow when a young boy reaches adolescence.  It signals that a boy has reached sexual maturity.  Secondary sexual characteristics are thought to give a mating advantage - like the bright tails of the peacock.  They aren't really useful, except when attracting a mate.<br>  <br>  Women don't have beards because we don't have the high levels of testosterone.  Women who take testosterone will grow a beard.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	the hair is broken by abrasions and friction... same reason for feet, hands, knee caps etc don't have hair<br>  Have so seen an orangutan?

Here is one theory:<br>  <br>  Humans are cursorial hunters.  That is we walk/run long distances and chase down prey by tiring them out.<br>  <br>  A pack of humans can't run faster than a horse or deer, but they can keep running/walking after a horse or deer until the animal collapses from heat exhaustion.<br>  <br>  This is a very unusual style of hunting.  <br>  <br>  It is also very energetic, and therefore we need good cooling systems.<br>  <br>  That is probably why we lost most of our body hair, and have far more sweat glands than typical mammals.<br>  <br>  We probably kept the hair on our head to help keep the sun off when doing these long chases under African suns.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Here is another theory:<br>  <br>  A major process in human evolution is neotany.<br>  <br>  That we evolved, by keeping child-like features into adulthood.<br>  <br>  Obvous examples: Relatively huge heads compared to our bodies, shortened limbs, flattened faces<br>  <br>  (if you look at baby apes you will see they all have these features compared to adult apes, adult humans have it too, and human children have it even more so).<br>  <br>  And perhaps hairless came along for the ride, i.e. we evolved to retain child-like features, and even though lack of hair was not selected for (but big heads were), we got it too because the same genes are involved.<br>  <br>  3.

0CTsNzTsaa	The equilibrium constant K = [SO3][NO]/[SO2][NO2] = 3.75 (by the way, the constant, since it is greater than 1.00, means the reaction goes to the right... we'll use that information now).    If everything starts at .9M, then let's assume that x moles of SO2 and x moles of NO2 react to form x moles of SO3 and x moles NO. The new concentrations will be:    [SO2] = .900 - x  [NO2] = .900 - x  [SO3] = .900 + x  [NO] = .900 + x    So, K = [SO3][NO]/[SO2][NO2] =  [.900+x]^2 / [.900-X]^2 = 3.75  square root both sides and work to find the answer.

Gnfc4wRlaa	The origin of the oceans has puzzled people for a very long time, and even today, the issue has not been completely settled.      Cooling Atmosphere   The knowledge that the earth must once have been red hot, judged by lava spewing from volcanoes, made people think that the oceans must have originated from steam in the atmosphere. As the world cooled, it rained for thousands of years until the oceans were formed, so they thought. But there's a problem with this idea. The pull of gravity of this planet is just enough to keep an atmosphere together whose weight is no more than ten metres of water. So even if the old atmosphere consisted entirely of steam, the oceans would have filled only to a mere ten metres, rather than 3800. Scientist estimate the amount of water escaping from the early hot planet at 1.6E9 km3, whereas the volume of today's oceans is 5.2E9 km3 (W W Ruby, 1951).       Steam from the interior   Today most authors believe that early steam from the hot mantle but already cool atmosphere, caused the oceans in the very early stages of the planet. They reason from studies of chondrites (space rocks) in space that under compression, enough water could be released to form an ocean. Today one can observe the gases escaping from active volcanoes, and these too contain water. In this scenario, the oceans would still be increasing in size, a gradual process that would never really end. But why did the continental crust expand suddenly about 3 eons ago? (see below)   The amount of water stored in rocks of the primary lithosphere is estimated at 25E21kg (Hutchinson G E, 1957), whereas the water in all oceans is 1.35E21kg, so it is quite possible that all this water emerged slowly after rocks were compressed and heated while the atmosphere had cooled already.       Debris from space   From the ratios of certain elements, scientists now agree that earth and the other planets in our solar system were formed by accretion from interstellar or cosmic debris (dust), left over from the explosion of a supernova star in our galaxy. Look at the moon and its many craters, each a remnant of a collision with a large object. The sun gathered most of it, growing to a size sufficiently large to become a nuclear fusion reactor. Our planet grew in size and started to heat up due to the falling apart (radio activity) of heavy elements and due to compression. At one stage the planet became just liquid enough for lighter materials to migrate to its surface, and heavy elements to migrate to its core. Continents formed, and an ocean crust. Knowing that water has been identified on cosmic objects such as comets, the thought grew that water must have rained down from space, just like the rest of Earth's mass. Quite a reasonable idea, since the volume of the earth is 800,000 larger than that of the ocean.  But all the time that the earth formed, it was too hot for an ocean. In fact, the oldest rocks found are about 3800 million years (My) old (Rocks from the moon 4550 My), whereas the age of this planet is estimated at 4600 million years. By the time the earth had cooled enough, most of the cosmic impact that formed it, had also ceased. Why is it that the only planet with life is also the only planet with an ocean? And why is it that other planets, that were formed in the same way as ours, do not have oceans?       Co-evolution of climate, oceans and life   The idea is that a small amount of water formed after cooling (the archean sea, perhaps 100-300 m deep in small seas here and there, the amount of water necessary for changing CH4 to C to CO2 and NH4 to N2 and SO4 to S, and an atmosphere consisting largely of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen - a mixture lethal to organisms alive today. Imagine this ocean as a shallow, warm, acidic, black cesspool full of stinking bacteria. The water for this ocean came from the earth's crust, and from sunlight dissociating CO2 in the upper atmosphere. The formed oxygen could then bind with the escaping hydrogen to form water. The warm ocean evaporated much water vapour and it rained torrentially. Because no living organisms were found on the land, erosion must have been very intense, resulting in enormous amounts of run-off, containing sediment and nutrients.    For more water to form, the hydrogen, escaping from the planet, had to be bound with more oxygen. But oxygen was available only as carbon compounds in carbon dioxide. Only life, in the act of photosynthesis, is able to split carbon and oxygen from carbon dioxide in large quantities. The carbon that formed, was buried underground and for each atom of carbon, two molecules of water were formed. The cyanobacteria capable of doing this, formed about 3600 My ago. By 2500 My ago, the oceans would have formed|`|AA6Aq94vaa	It took millions of years, in fact for the first several thousand, the earth was so hot that the rain evaporated before it hit the surface|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well it's not like there was a constant rain which formed oceans. Comets and meteorites (with lots of ice on them) fell to earth and brought water. This evaporated and eventually rained down, in the water cycle.|`|XliM2cWaaa	The earth was all water at one time. The only animals were marine. Over time land developed. The oceans have nothing to do with rain.

The uniform charge density, except near the  edges, on a single very large conducting plate  is another. Larger--> flatter---> geometry--->uniform.

hLr6XLrbaa	Blue eyes is a recessive trait meaning that your husband could carry the trait for blue eyes and not actually display it.    Since you have blue eyes by default you have passed that characteristic to your baby boy.  Each parent has 2 copies of each allele.  For you to have blue eyes your genetics are:    blue/blue    Your husband could very well be:    Brown/blue    and still have brown eyes since brown is dominant.  Since both you and your husband donate 1 allele your son has a 50% chance of having blue eyes.    One caveat is that by default babies eyes are all blue at birth as the protein that controls eye color (melanin) has not fully deposited in your eyes.  This can take up until the first year for that to happen.  They can still change given your son is only 4 months old.    Blonde hair color is the same in terms of genetics and the same argument applies but having blonde hair on his face is likely due to the melanin argument as well.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	if your husband has relatives with blue eyes it means that the baby has one chromosome with "blue eyes" from his dad and another from you, because your husband would have a recessive character that has "blue eyes" on it. if he doesn't, you should know that there are many other genes that have an influence on this character, so the apparent genetics and calculations you're making aren't necessary sufficient for you to decide whether or not your baby will always have blue eyes. you should wait a couple of years because such characters change and his eyes could turn black or could stay blue!
XydWCwZVaa	I assume you mean    (-4)*(4.3).    Look at it like this:  -(4)*(43/10) = -(4 * 43)/10 = - 172 / 10 = 17.2    If you are confused as to where the decimal point is suppose to go, then for the moment drop the decimal    -4*4 = 16.  So the answer has to be close to -16.    Then multiply your decimals with out worrying about the ".".    -4*43 = -172.  The answer needs to be near -16 so it is -17.2
1Q9ldcWSaa	This was in the movie 21.  I don't remember what the answer was though.

hHVMrnK3aa	Assuming the host knows what's behind each door,  and he *always* opens a door (not just when you picked the car),  then you should switch.    What he is offering is a choice between the ONE door you picked  and BOTH of the other two doors (one of which happens to be   open at the moment).    If he had offered you that choice in the beginning, you would   have taken the two doors because it gives you twice the chance  to win.  Opening the door didn't change that, so you should switch.|`|nDv2EtuGaa	Surprisingly the answer is "Yes", you should switch to increase your chances of winning the car!    The wrinkle in the problem comes from the fact that the host, who knows what's behind the two remaining doors, will NEVER open the door with the car.
c148aM3Xaa	yup that's the right answer    this what I did:  9-x^2y^2    (3-xy)(3-xy)    and I think you know to check you just use foil(first,inside,outside,last) so that would be    9-3xy+3xy-x^2y^2    and of course -3xy and +3xy just cancel each other out|`|REb0XRgRaa	Okay:    You have to see what multiplied together gives you that term.      3*3 = 9 and xy*xy = x^2y^2    so combine and you have (3-xy)(3+xy)    Notice, I changed the sign, that is called a conjugate

Since it is even there will be 2 middle numbers so you average those two numbers (add them up and divide by 2) So your median is 10.5.    Mode is if there are any repeated numbers in the set. In an example set: 1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 5, 7, 1 The mode would be 1, 3, and 5.    Mean is average.

Mean = (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+ 17+18+19+20)/20  That is also: 10.5    And there is no mode because all of the number appear the same amount of times.|`|jHPqGrxOaa	Median: the median is when you put the numbers in order and cross them off going back and forth crossing off one at each end until you get the middle number. If you end up with two numbers in the middle, the median is in the middle of those numbers (9 and 10, the answer would be 9.5)   Mode: Mode is most often, if there isn't a number that occurs more often, than there is no mean.  mean: mean is where you  add up all the numbers and divide by how many numbers there are in the set.  ANSWERS  Median: 10.5  Mode: No mode  Mean: 9.5  Hope I could help!
kPG2g4iSaa	"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."    Ultimately, living things (including humans) are all made of stuff that had to come from the earth which is essentially a big, spherical pile of rocks. All of these rocks contain the building blocks of life, but those building blocks in rocks as we understand them are just too big to be able to be used by any form of life we know of. Weathering breaks down those rocks into ever tinier pieces until these pieces are small enough to be incorporated into the cells of living tissue. Without weathering, the elements vital to life would never exist in a form that life could access.

Gnfc4wRlaa	No, it won't.  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years. <br>  <br>  Zecharia Sitchen - an author, not a scientist, a proponent of the ancient astronaut theory and the Annunaki, Nibiru/Planet X<br>  Mark Hazlewood - author of a book predicting Planet X to come in 2003<br>  The Hysteria Channel - promoting doomsday scenarios to increase viewers and sell advertising.<br>  The Mayans - didn't predict the end of the world.  It is only the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  Nostradamus - No mention of 2012. Didn't predict the end of the world.<br>  The Bible - no mention of 2012. It talks about the end times, no mention of when.<br>  <br>  Nibiru/Planet X - It doesn't exist. Planet X is a name that was used when looking for an unknown planet. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar. <br>  <br>  Asteroid impact - the Asteroid Apophis - the collision alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.<br>  <br>  Polar Reversal - the magnetic poles are moving all the time. Polar reversals have occurred in the past, but we can’t predict when they will occur again. <br>  <br>  Alignment of the plane of the Solar System with the galactic plane - There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012. It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012. Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us. The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.<br>  <br>  Planetary alignment - The planets don't truly align. Some of the planets sometimes appear to be aligned from our perspective, but are not actually aligned in space.<br>  <br>  Photon Belt - We are not heading for a photon belt in the Pleiades. The earth isn't heading toward the Pleiades but away from them. In the 1850s it was conjectured that the earth orbited the Pleiades, but this has long since been discredited. No photon belt or other such region of increased energy has been discovered. Photons in any case are merely particles of electromagnetic energy, which we commonly experience as light. Upon exposure to excess photons the most common transformation of your being is sunburn.<br>  <br>  Solar Flares - Solar flares do increase and decrease in an 11 years cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005. <br>  <br>  Supervolcano Eruption -One cannot present recurrence intervals based on only two values. It would be statistically meaningless. But for those who insist... let's do the arithmetic. The three eruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 0.64 million years ago. The two intervals are thus 0.8 and 0.66 million years, averaging to a 0.73 million-year interval. Again, the last eruption was 0.64 million years ago, implying that we are still about 90,000 years away from the time when we might consider calling Yellowstone overdue for another caldera-forming eruption.|`|O8qyhAegaa	Winter solstice 2012 is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end).

tK7hl9Qlaa	When you take the inverse of the function, restrictions for the domain become restrictions for the range, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  So your restrictions on x (the domain) in the original function become restrictions on f^-1 (x) (the range) in your new function.<br>  <br>  In this case, there is no restriction.  Your inverse function has a global maximum of 4 (when x=0), so the restriction does not apply.
LVPNuEsLaa	No.<br>  <br>  A moving object by definition has a non-zero velocity, but that velocity vector (indicating both speed and direction) can change over time.  Integrating the velocity over time gives you the change in position over the period of the integration.<br>  <br>  In this case, the integration of that changing velocity vector over the period of one circuit gives you a net change in position of zero.  But the velocity only goes to zero if the car stops.|`|XXyHd0AQaa	No not quite.<br>  <br>  Velocity needs a magnitude and a vector. And when it is traveling in a circle, the direction keeps changing. However, you would not say that its velocity is 0 kph, you would say that the velocity is not constant even though the speed is. Or that the velocity is constantly changing. However, you don't really describe objects moving in a circle with velocity, you would just describe it with its speed.|`|jf1s8kDmaa	no velocity can never be zero if a car is moving, even if it stays at 200 kph its changing direction since its going in a circle<br>  <br>  remember velocity is a vector so its magnitude + direction,therefore even if the speed is the same, and the direction is changing, then the velocity is changing.|`|KY37KWpUaa	Yup, since the car came back to where it started, that means its total displacement was 0 meters.

Instantaneous is when v = dS/dt and dt --> zero; so the change in distance dS is also ---> 0.  In which case, the direction is ill defined and we ignore it.  In that case, we call v = |v| speed.<br>  <br>  But when dt > 0, the change in distance dS will have direction.  In which case, the value for v = dS/dt will also have that same direction and that makes v a vector.<br>  <br>  In your case, the velocity is not zero, because it does have magnitude.  What is lacks is direction; so the car's velocity is really the tangential speed and that is 200 kph.

That would be your indicator for the presence of I2. Yes, it  will be dark, but in the shades of violet-blue.<br>  <br>  And, the proper term is titrate. If you get color, you need to add more of either your base or acid, depends on which one would react with Iodine to eliminate it.<br>  <br>  Its added in the end because putting it in the beginning would affect your titration.

dwtgApiGaa	If this makes sense to you, have at it...<br>  <br>  "suppose there were a positive integer which cannot be written as a product of primes. Then there must be a smallest such number (see well-order): let it be n. This number n cannot be 1, because of the empty-product convention above. It cannot be a prime number either, since any prime number is a product of a single prime, itself. So it must be a composite number. Thus<br>  n = ab<br>  where both a and b are positive integers smaller than n. Since n is the smallest number which cannot be written as a product of primes, both a and b can be written as products of primes. But then<br>  n = ab<br>  can be written as a product of primes as well, a proof by contradiction. This is a minimal counterexample argument."<br>  <br>  You know that you don't have to worry about even numbers, or numbers ending in 5 (because 2 and 5 consistently pick those up). Every 6th number is covered by 3 (because every 6th number between that is even).  But that's all I've got....sorry|`|tqQIcLb5aa	If the integer, say n, is prime then it is divisible by itself.<br>  If the integer n is not prime then it is a product of two or more SMALLER integers of which neither is 1 (else it would be prime). Now consider one of these integers. Either it is prime (in which case n has a prime divisor) else it is a product of two or more SMALLER integers of which neither is 1. Now consider one of these integers. Either it is prime (in which case n has a prime divisor) else it is a product of two or more SMALLER integers of which neither is 1 etc . . . Now we see that because the positive integers are ordered and that the numbers we consider each time get smaller this process HAS TO halt. That is eventually will find that a fact (or divisor) cannot be a product of two smaller positive integers. That is it prime.<br>  <br>  This is an informal argument and you need to formalise it slightly.<br>  <br>  I think a similar argument is included in these notes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/P.J.Flavell/teaching/Foundation/start.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/P.J.Flavell/te...</a>|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Prime numbers can be divided by themselves<br>  Non-prime numbers by definition are divisible by a product of two or more primes.

After all he is a wild animal and as such should have been left in his own environment, like the rest of all animals. The human race as we call ourselves are never satisfied with our own lives, so we interfere with all wild animals. We have taken their lives over and the places where they live and breed, and we still are not satisfied so we then interfere again by putting them in cages, which of course is unatural to them.They were here on the Earth  first, so they are more entitled to it than we are, so perhaps we should remember that.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	This is exactly the type of thing that happens when a person takes a wild animal into their house and pretends that it's not a wild animal.  Have you seen the list of things she taught the chimp to do? it's clear she was viewing the animal as a person (she even said she could not have loved him more than if she had given birth to him).  Wild animals will always be wild. They cannot be domesticated. Problems always arise when people raise animals in their homes and begin to let their guard down and then they're surprised when the animal finally does snap. Just like sigfried and roy, this was going to happen sooner or later. It's just sad that this person who was attacked was so severely injured because of it.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	The same thing that makes all wild animals turn on their owners, trainers, or handlers.  Good examples are Steve Erwin, the Grizzly man, Sigfried & Roy, and the zoos that are filled with X-pets that have become too much for their stupid owners to handle.<br>  They are WILD ANIMALS !!  Let me say that again, THEY ARE WILD ANIMALS.  And, as such, should be left in the wild where they do their part in helping to keep this planet healthy and strong.  They do NOT belong on someone's floor as a rug or on the wall as a trophy head, or as food in a world where food can be bought in any local market.  They do NOT belong in zoos or animal compounds, or as trained curiosities.<br>  Wild animals are wild and as such CANNOT be trusted, especially when they reach maturity.  When that happens a switch goes off in their brains and they revert to the instincts and other characteristics that make them adults of that species.

utbfT0APaa	If the world was in DANGER, science nor humans could do nothing about it. You think man can destroy the planet? What intoxicating vanity. Let me tell you about our planet. Earth is four-and-a-half-billion-years-old. There's been life on it for nearly that long, 3.8 billion years. Bacteria first; later the first multicellular life, then the first complex creatures in the sea, on the land. Then finally the great sweeping ages of animals, the amphibians, the dinosaurs, at last the mammals, each one enduring millions on millions of years, great dynasties of creatures rising, flourishing, dying away -- all this against a background of continuous and violent upheaval. Mountain ranges thrust up, eroded away, commentary impacts, volcano eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving, an endless, constant, violent change, colliding, buckling to make mountains over millions of years. Earth has survived everything in its time. It will certainly survive us. If all the nuclear weapons in the world went off at once and all the plants, all the animals died and the earth was sizzling hot for a hundred thousand years, life would survive, somewhere: under the soil, frozen in Arctic ice. Sooner or later, when the planet was no longer inhospitable, life would spread again. The evolutionary process would begin again. It might take a few billion years for life to regain its present variety. Of course, it would be very different from what it is now, but the earth would survive our folly, only we would not. If the ozone layer gets thinner, ultraviolet radiation sears the earth, so what? Ultraviolet radiation is good for life. It's powerful energy. It promotes mutation, change. Many forms of life will thrive with more UV radiation. Many others will die out. Do you think this is the first time that's happened? Think about oxygen. Necessary for life now, but oxygen is actually a metabolic poison, a corrosive glass, like fluorine. When oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cells some three billion years ago, it created a crisis for all other life on earth. Those plants were polluting the environment, exhaling a lethal gas. Earth eventually had an atmosphere incompatible with life. Nevertheless, life on earth took care of itself. In the thinking of the human being a hundred years is a long time. A hundred years ago we didn't have cars, airplanes, computers or vaccines. It was a whole different world, but to the earth, a hundred years is nothing. A million years is nothing. This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale. We can't imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to try. We've been residents here for the blink of an eye. If we're gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us.|`|6t76bgS3aa	"Science" can't save the world any more than english, history, math or anything else they tell you in school can.

How to guard against disease, how to grow more and better crops, how to insure the safety of our foods, how to provide ample energy in the most efficient way, etc. -- these are the challenges of science.<br>  <br>  When the world population began its last rapid expansion, during the middle 18th century, it was only able to do so because science and its applications in industry met the need required to feed, cloth, shelter and guard against disease as well as safely eliminate environmental waste through advanced sanitation systems, improved air and water quality management, and through generous contributions of new discovery and knowledge; all of that which was necessary to fend off the host of unrelenting threats upon a human population that was itself a problem by growing faster than its own ability to sustain life.  <br>  <br>  I suspect that science (if it is allowed to remain unhampered by ignorantly spread fears) will continue to advance our future for the good of all by reaching out to understand our nearby world and our universe even into the vastness of infinite space.

Ftkr9jqYaa	The use of the terms "advanced" and "primitive" is inappropriate when comparing current species, since they have all survived through the present time, and thus it is wrong to favor certain traits (such as human intelligence), and regard species lacking those traits as primitive, inferior, or less evolved.  I will instead use the terms megafauna and megaflora to refer to species with large body sizes, and such such terms as simple vs. complex and the earlier-evolved vs. later-evolved.<br>  <br>  Asymmetry.  The only animal phylum that has no symmetry is Porifera (sponges), which is one of the earliest-evolved phylogenetically.<br>  <br>  Symmetry - In general, megafauna and megaflora tend to have less symmetry than smaller species.  Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth, to the center of the opposite, or aboral, end. This type of symmetry is especially suitable for sessile animals such as the sea anemone, floating animals such as jellyfish, and slow moving organisms such as sea stars.<br>  <br>  Bilateral symmetry. Found primarily in the taxon Bilateria, which is generally accepted to be a monphyletic clade of the kingdom Animalia, and includes mammals such as Homo sapiens.<br>  <br>  Tetramerism.  Many jellyfish have four [digestive] canals and thus exhibit tetramerous radial symmetry. This form of radial symmetry can be divided into 4 equal parts.<br>  <br>  Pentamerism.  Found in many plants and some animals.  Members of the phylum Echinodermata (such as sea stars and sea urchins) have parts [including digestive systems] arranged around the axis of the mouth in five equal sectors. Being bilaterian animals however, they initially develop biradially as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later on. The radiolarians (a type of amoeboid protozoan) demonstrate a remarkable array of pentameric forms.<br>  <br>  Hexamerism.  Corals and sea anemones (class Anthozoa) are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals, in the subclass Hexacorallia, have a hexameric body plan; their polyps have sixfold internal symmetry and the number of their tentacles is a multiple of six.<br>  <br>  Octamerism.  Corals belonging to the subclass Octocorallia have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry.<br>  <br>  Segmentation is the division of some metazoan (i.e., multicellular eukaryotic) and plant body plans into a series of semi-repetitive modules, and is related to the more general concept of modularity.<br>  <br>  Examples of segmented animals are the annelids and arthropods, but segmentation does not exist in cnidarians (i.e., jellyfish, corals, sea anemones). Vertebrata are also inherited in a segmented way, making it easy for those animals to adapt to have the correct number of spinal cord segments in the vertebral column. This has been extensively studied in mice. Among plants, the horsetails are a clear example of segmentation.<br>  <br>  Segmentation allows for a high degree of specialization of bodily regions. This regional specialization is seen to some degree in annelids, but is an evolutionary development of the body plan of arthropods.<br>  <br>  The process of establishing a segmented body pattern is an example of morphogenesis.<br>  <br>  Digestive systems tend to be more complicated in herbivorous animals than any other species, because of the difficulties in catabolizing cellulose and hemi-cellulose.  Herbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.  In contrast, omnivorous humans rely on a single-chambered stomach, although the intestines are relatively complex.

dGN8YoEQaa	Crayfish use gills to perform respiration. The gills are located in between the carapace (the exoskeleton of the cephalothorax) and the lateral body wall, in the branchial chamber. <br>  <br>  Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the blood and water across the gill surface as water is circulated through the branchial chamber by the beating of the gill bailer on the second maxilla.<br>  <a href="http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/Biology/Harbour/SPECIES/CRAYFISH/CRAYFISH.HTM#Respiratory" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.mcmaster.ca/Biology/H...</a><br>  <br>  The respiratory system in grasshoppers is called the tracheal system. It involves the diffusion of oxygen directly from the atmosphere into the air-filled tubes.

MAAxboH7aa	To be classified as an arthropod an organism basically has to have three characteristics:<br>  <br>  1. Segmented body. All Subphyla of the Phylum Arthropoda have at least three segments per body. <br>  <br>  2. Exoskeleton. Made out of chitin, it is hard and needs to be shed for the arthropod to grow in size, hence the stair-like shape on an arthropod's growth chart.<br>  <br>  3. Jointed appendages. Their limbs, legs, claws etc are jointed.<br>  <br>  Most arthropods also have open circulatory systems, whereas annelids have closed circulatory systems. <br>  <br>  Whilst annelids have segmented bodies, they neither have exoskeletons nor jointed appendages, and those are the main differences that they have from arthropods.<br>  <br>  Peace :)|`|lhB213Imaa	Arthropods generally have jointed limbs (legs), while annelids (worms) do not.  Some arthropods, for example, lobsters, have claws.  Some, such as crayfish, have external gills for breathing.<br>  <br>  Arthropods also have a hard chitinized exoskeleton.

Just look around you and identify all the products that are made up of plastics.  If plastics were not available, what kind of materials could be used in their place?  <br>  <br>  For example, plastic bottles would have to be replaced by glass.  Glass is much heavier and can break.  Broken glass can be dangerous when stepped on or touched.  <br>  <br>  Synthetic fabrics (nylon, polyester, orlon, etc.) would have to be replaced with wool, silk, and cotton.

AA10927246	Back when computers were scarce, banks used to compound interest quarterly. That meant that four times a year they would have an "interest day", when everybody's balance got bumped up by one fourth of the going interest rate... and bank employees would have to work late, going home with cramped, inky fingers. If you held an account in those days, every year your balance would increase by a factor of (1 + r/4)^4. <br>  <br>  Today it's possible to compound interest monthly (everyone's balance increased by a factor of 1/12 the interest rate) or daily (1/365 of the interest rate).  But if you think about it, why couldn't you compound hourly (1/8760 of the interest rate)?  Or every minute?  Or every second, or in the limiting case, continuously, meaning that your balance grows by a small amount every instant.<br>  <br>  It turns out that there is a limit to compounding.  Although it would seem that if you compound every instant you might be giving away an infinite amount of money, it doesn't work that way.  The rate of compounding actually reaches a limit.  That's because you compound more and more times (towards infinity) but the interest rate is split into smaller and smaller amounts.  As one goes up the other goes down and the result converges on a constant rate based on 'e'.<br>  <br>  To get the formula for continuous compounding we'll start out with interest compounded n times per year: <br>  <br>  FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)<br>  <br>  where P is the starting principal and FV is the future value after t years. <br>  <br>  To get to the continuous case we take the limit as the time slices get tiny: <br>  <br>  FV = limit P(1 + r/n)^(nt)<br>  ...... n -> ∞ <br>  <br>  We can simplify the right side by introducing a new variable, defining m = n/r <br>  <br>  FV = limit P(1 + 1/m)^(mrt)<br>  ...... m -> ∞ <br>  <br>  FV = P [ limit (1 + 1/m)^m ]^rt)<br>  ............ m -> ∞ <br>   <br>  As your book notes, the limit in the square brackets converges to the number e ≈ 2.71828.... (In fact, Leonhard Euler may have thought of this limit as the definition of e, right around the time he named it "e" after himself). <br>  <br>  So the formula becomes <br>  <br>  FV = Pe^rt <br>  <br>  To solve your problem, plug in a future value of 2P and solve from there.<br>  <br>  2P = Pe^rt<br>  <br>  Divide both sides by P (which cancels it out):<br>  2 = e^rt<br>  <br>  Take the natural log of both sides:<br>  ln(2) = ln(e^rt)<br>  <br>  If you remember your facts on the constant e and the natural log (ln), you'll know that they are inverse functions.  In other words, the ln function "undoes" e to some power.  The result is just 'rt' in the function above.<br>  <br>  ln(2) = rt<br>  <br>  Finally divide both sides by r:<br>  t = ln(2) / r<br>  <br>  In your case, the rate is 10% (or 0.10) per year, so plug this in for r.<br>  t = ln(2) / 0.1<br>  <br>  Dividing by 1/10 is the same as multiplying by 10:<br>  t = 10 ln(2)<br>  <br>  Plug that into your calculator to get the answer.<br>  t ≈ 6.9314718055994530941723212145818<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  Just under 7 years to double an investment compounding continuously at 10% per year.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Now that you know the method, you can use the formula at the end to figure out any problem like this.  For example if someone asked you to figure out the number of years until your money *tripled* at 11% per annum, you'd just figure:<br>  t = ln(3) / 0.11 ≈ 10 years<br>  <br>  P.P.S.

If you like graphs, then it's easy enough to understand, but you can use real-life examples too.<br>  <br>  For example: Say you and a friend are getting candy, but your friend is greedy and must always have twice as much candy as you. You could represent this mathematically as "x" being the amount of candy you have, and "y" being how much your friend has. Here, y is proportional to x. Basically, however much candy you have, she will always have two times more. If you have 5 pieces, she has 10. You have 15, she has 30. Doubling x (your candy) will have the effect of doubling y (her candy). This can be written as an equation like "y=2x", so y is defined as twice as large as x.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...|`|IqxFo2u7aa	PMA, of course you can get an A, don't knock yourself down<br>  <br>  directly proportional means, if you pedal twice as hard the bike goes twice as fast, that's all, <br>  the little symbol you're on about is an alpha<br>  <br>  wiki's your friend<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportiona...</a>|`|7PbJWEo1aa	wow its a few years since I did my A levels, I would suggest having a word with your tutor and asking if they can go over the basics.

OXw0rv4Saa	For some reason, your immune system thinks those foods are toxic and foreign invaders of your body.  Your immune system produces several different types of cells, and B cells are the ones that produce antibodies.  There are only a couple of B cells producing a very tiny amount of antibody (specific to an antigen) at a constant level all the time.  <br>  So, if you are allergic to strawberries, you may only have 1 or 2 or 3 anti-strawberry B-cells in your body at a time.  They produce a very low-level constant stream of antibodies (which can hang around in the blood for a few weeks or months until the body reabsorbs them) The second you eat a strawberry, however, those anti-strawberry B cells start producing TONS of antibody, as well as making other anti-strawberry B cells. <br>  <br>  Once the strawberry antigen is gone, you retain high levels of antibody for several weeks, and then it resumes its original low level.  <br>  <br>  No, your food sensitivities will no go away or get better.  In fact, they usually get worse.  For example, a person allergic to peanuts or bee stings or penicillin may only have a mild reaction to the allergen the first time he is exposed.  It gets worse and worse each time, as the body responds more and more forcefully to the antigen.  Eventually, these reactions can be life threatening, requiring the person to carry a medicated syringe with them at all times, just in case.<br>  <br>  The only way I know of to "desensitize" yourself to allergens is with a series of injections of the allergen- a complicated and expensive process that only sometimes works.  You would have to speak with a physician who specializes in immune systems and allergies to discuss your specific food allergies and whether these shots would work for you.<br>  Otherwise, you're pretty much stuck with them for life.

At 1500 for one year should be around 175 to a little over 200. The thing is what can you aford to pay. example- a 10,000.00 vehicle loan for 5 years cost around 268 per/mo with total payment of over 16k. However if the purchaser can aford a payment of 500 to 600 per/mo it will take about 1 1/2 years to pay off the 10k loan with a total payment of around 12k a savings of 4k. So if you can afored to pay more than the payment your making now you come out a head with less interest and having the loan paid off sooner.Remember nothing in life is free and 7 3/4 is a fare loan rate right now. If the money was needed then you do the best you can. However if you really didn't need the loan you should't have borrowed it in the first place. You can if you like look to re-finance the loan with another lending institution after a few month and try to get a better rate. However I don't think rates are going to come down for a while. If you try to re-finenance to soon the new lender will most likely turn you down. Reason is they will look at the loan as high risk thinking you are re-financig because you can't meet the payment. STAY away from re-financing all you loans. It is very costly to add car payment credit card bills, school loans etc. then have to pay them off over the next  5 year or more. It may lower your monthly payments but you will be paying for things that most likely will be in the trash long before they are paid off.

Probably the monthly instalment, but different people here have made different guesses. What matters more, WIDELY different interpretations of the interest rate have been made.<br>  <br>  trackstarr59 has found correctly the sum to be repaid -- but in a year's time, NOT by 12 instalments -- if interest is compounded monthly. That's why her 1620.47 is somewhat greater than 1500 plus the simple interest of 116.25, which is 7.75% of 1500, as in Corky R's answer. He goes on to work out the monthly instalment as 1616.25/12 = 134.69. But if they really repay the principal and interest by such instalments, then this is roughly equivalent to repaying the WHOLE LOT halfway through (after 6 months), which effectively DOUBLES the interest rate to over 15% (a standard if rather dishonest trick: the "flat rate" of r% means roughly 2r% APR)! If they repay by 12 instalments AND the interest rate is HONESTLY to be 7.75%, then the instalments need to be lower, roughly halfway between the 134.69 and the interest-free repayment of 1500/12 = 125 (approx. 130). For an exact calculation, equate the 1620.47 (assuming compound interest) to the value, in a year, of the stream of 12 equal instalments x, and work out x (summing the geo progression). So Red Ryders's answer -- Total interest = $63.72, and [monthly] Payment amount = $130.31 -- is about RIGHT (and possibly exactly right). They should be paying about a fiver of interest a month (on top of the 125 of principal repayment).|`|938baf04d52c5af8257452ea595caa48aa	P = 1500<br>  t = 1<br>  r = .0775<br>  n = 12<br>  A(t) = P(1 + (r/n))^nt<br>  A(t) = 1500(1 + (.0775/12))^12<br>  A(t) = 1620.47<br>  <br>  ANSWER<br>  $1620.47

RgSCstkAaa	If I understand your rather curious design requirement aright, what you are effectively asking for is a transformer output at half the frequency of a square wave input. That being so, you don't need a centre-tapped transformer. You need a logic circuit which halves the input frequency and applies that to the transformer. Do you even need the transformer?|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	you should not drive a transformer with unipolar signal, as the DC component will saturate the transformer.<br>  <br>  But a push-pull drive is fine. Look at inverter schematics for ideas.  The reference has a rudimentary schematic.<br>  <br>  <br>  But if this is not an inverter or equivalent, the other answer is correct, you can do this with logic circuits, no transformer needed. Perhaps you can provide more details?<br>  <br>  .
rcPnnfmmaa	The main artery in your leg is on the inside of your groin running along the inner thigh and getting deeper as you go. If you cut this you will die very, very quickly.<br>  <br>  The main artery for the arm runs under the bicep on your upper arm. It's hard to cut open until you get lower down. It passes near the surface on the inside of your elbow, then it goes back a little deeper and continues down your arm. Cutting this is not as quickly lethal as a cut to the femoral artery in your leg...but it's perfectly capable of killing you.<br>  <br>  In your hand the main artery enters south of the base of your thumb.<br>  <br>  You'll feel a pulse at all these points. There are more points behind your knees, all over your feet and in your neck.<br>  <br>  You have many smaller arteries and veins. Veins are near your arteries but have a more-visible blue color. They are under less pressure but you can still die if you cut them open.<br>  <br>  You can use these pressure points to prolong your own life. If you do cut the femoral artery behind the knee you can block it upstream by providing pressure to the point near the surface in the fold of your groin. Apply direct pressure to the point you cut. Don't try to make a tourniquet because you'll do it wrong and at the wrong time.<br>  <br>  Never, ever cut along the length of a vein or artery. Cuts across a vein are easy to hold closed and generally heal well.<br>  <br>  Arterial bleeds spurt more. They're a little lighter shade of bright red but venous blood turns bright red fairly quickly on contact with air. It's hard to tell even under good lighting.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to even try to tackle the psychological aspects of this question. You probably know that this is a little crazy and that you need real help. I wish you the best of luck.|`|hOmSKJtdaa	I'll say it anyway: stop cutting.<br>  Also watch for veins.  They are often near your arteries though, so just avoid these areas in general.<br>  Now to answer your question:<br>  The arteries in the leg are mainly located in your upper thigh and around the groin region, so please cut lower down on your shins and feet, as those are mainly just capillary beds.<br>  In the arms the main regions of the arteries and veins is on inner side of your upper forearm (the brachea) and on your wrist (the radial), however they do span all across your forearm (on the inside), but they are just closest to your skin at those points.  If you do cut your forearms cut closer to the elbow where you have more fat or muscle.  If possible cut on top of your arms or even your hands, as it is the safest part.<br>  <br>  Again: Stop cutting.  I have family who were alcoholics but have now been clean for years (some are going on 16 or more).  So you CAN stop cutting.  You just have to try.<br>  Cutting is always dangerous, so please, PLEASE try to stop.  Although if you must I again recommend the shins, as they are really just capillary beds, so while cuts there may seem serious they are most likely safe.|`|W0SXKFqCaa	go to a psychologist. your crazy.<br>  <br>  "well then stop cutting!" cus it u where a cutter u would realize its really hard to stop once u start, its like taking alcohol away from an alcoholic<br>  <br>  thats not true at all.<br>  alcohol is a drug, cutting your self isnt. go to a doctor and get help, seriously.|`|QxzpEfhKaa	You should call your mom and get to a doctor.|`|hChJyYEBaa	Ok, so your arteries are very very deep in side your legs and arms, it is possible to nip them, but you'd know about it.<br>  Veins are almost as dangerous as arteries to a self-harmer as you are much much less likely to medical help, and the slow bleeding could cause you some problems, so it's always best where ever possible to get some help if you are worried. If you don't feel you can but you are still worried then make sure you keep a lot of pressure on the wound (get a load of toilet paper and push as hard as you can for as long as you can) this will help to stop the bleeding and help the healing.<br>  <br>  If you ever feel light headed or woozy make sure you get help, this is a sign of blood loss (although I understand the adrenaline rush can also give this effect)<br>  <br>  Make sure you keep your wounds clean, you can do this with alcohol wipes found in most first aid kits, if you can keep some around this will help prevent infection. If it is a deep cut then try and keep it bandaged up while it's healing, you can often hide these with sweat bands etc to prevent questions.<br>  <br>  If you ever want to talk to someone who's been there you can e-mail me on giddy_penguin@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  I also recommend this forum: <a href="http://www.nshn.co.uk/forum/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nshn.co.uk/forum/index.php</a> where you can talk to loads of people with the same mind set and people who have come through the other end. They also offer good ways of coping, other than cutting. They helped me no end.|`|mMxfVTSHaa	You should stop cutting. Just STOP.

Gravitation attraction, perhaps aided by shock waves induced in the proto-stellar gas/dust cloud by super novae, caused the huge cloud to slowly contract and grow denser. As the cloud contracted, conservation of angular momentum required the cloud to spin faster and faster. You see this effect when you watch a figure skater spin faster as she/he draws their arms and legs in closer to the body, increasing the rate of spin.<br>  This increase in rotation velocity is imparted to the material and also flattens it into an accretion disk. This accretion disk is where the proto-planets formed. <br>  The inertia associated with matter is what keeps the orbital velocity within a very small percent over the eons coupled with the fact that we are large distances away from any other large gravitation mass such as Jupiter which could act to perturb the earth's orbit. Without other forces to act upon the earth, the motion persists. See Newton's Laws of Motion for more detail.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	No one was here 4.6 billion years ago when the earth was formed and began circling the sun.  But here is a theory:<br>  In very early times, there was no sun or planets.  We were all just dust clouds in space.  Somehow, the dust got pushed around by nearby explosions of stars.  These made the clouds start turning.  As they turned, they became a disk.  The center got heavy, and attracted much gas, this became the sun.  Around it, streams of dust collected into little balls, then bigger ones.  They rotated fast or slow, depending upon their distance from the new sun.  The sun got very hot, and blew away gas that was near it.  That gas was swept up by a large ball and became Jupiter.  Another one became Saturn, etc.  But closer to the sun, there were only rocks spinning quickly and circling in only a few months of time, instead of years farther out.<br>  These small rocks, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, slowly changed into the planets we know now, with atmospheres and some with water.  But the initial force that started them around the sun was long ago, and only a theory now.  Astronomers have seen dust clouds and disks with young suns inside them, but they have not seen any planets form (yet).  <br>  The planets don't slow down because there is no resistance to their motion, compared to their large mass.  No air or surface friction will stop a planet.  Perhaps in billions of years, the sun will grow so large that it will swallow most inner planets, including Mars, but they will still be revolving quite fast even then.<br>  As to force that keeps a planet in orbit, that would be gravity, as Newton said.  But Einstein says it is the curvature of space-time near a large mass like the sun that makes a planet moving in a straight line to bend into a circular path.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The force is gravity, one of the four fundamental forces in the universe.|`|lYeEOpXOaa	The speed needed by a planet to remain in orbit comes from the sum of the speed of the items that make up the planet.  This acquiring of small parts into the larger body is called accretion.  Every meteor that you see in the sky is slowly adding to the mass of the earth and changing it's speed.  Each change is very small considering the earth's mass at the present time and the small mass of the meteor.<br>  <br>  In proto planets they are much smaller and the accreted matter is much larger in proportion to it.  This causes the initial speed to be more greatly affected at the beginning.  Most of the matter in a proto star is revolving in the same direction and this determines the direction of the rotation  of the system.<br>  <br>  In normal conditions the planets orbit will slowly increase in diameter as it ages.

aNlT1NRqaa	Black holes have been calculated to  need a star about 2.4 solar masses (2.4x the mass of our sun). Last year NASA discovered the smallest known black hole @ 3.8 solar masses and there are supermassive black holes that may reach millions to tens of billions (ultramassive black holes) of times the mass of our sun. These are what are now being studies as what holds most, if not all major galaxies (including ours) together.<br>  <br>  Eliot mentioned several ways to spot black holes, but there is another called lensing. The light from a galaxy behind the black hole passes around the black hole & is bent towards us. We either see multiple images of the same galaxy, or a distorted image going around the black hole. Also, a black hole is not necessarily invisible. When it feeds on matter, there is a lot of x-ray radiation created @ the event horizon (where nothing comes back from). We can see that. That's how we found the one in our galaxy.<br>  <br>  Finally, Stephen Hawking actually showed that black holes actually emit what is now known as Hawking Radiation. In effect they're evaporating (only takes a few billion years for the smaller ones to evaporate - if they don't feed).|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	A Black Hole is the remains of a super-massive star that has exploded in a super nova and collapsed in on itself with such force that it continues beyond the point where the outward pressure of the atoms being packed together would normally stop the collapse. This creates a Singularity with such massive density and gravity that, inside a certain distance from the Singularity (called the Event Horizon), even light cannot escape.<br>  <br>  Since no light (or any other kind of radiation) from the Singularity, itself, can ever be seen, the Singularity is "Black".<br>  <br>  And, anything within reach of its gravitational pull gets pulled down and disappears below the Event Horizon like falling into a hole.<br>  <br>  Hence, the origin and use of the term, "Black Hole".<br>  .|`|GIH9JB04aa	A black hole is a region is space where the gravity is so strong nothing can escape it! It warps spacetime to the breaking point into what's called the singularity( the center of the black hole). It's called a black hole because nothing can escape its enormous gravitational pull not even the fastest thing in the Universe which is EM radiation or the particles that mediate that interaction, photons!|`|v7Wflu78aa	A black hole is a collapsed star (our sun is too small, though) that has so much matter condensed in such a small volume that it's gravity is very strong.  So strong that the escape velocity (the speed needed to shoot off into space, escaping that gravity) is greater than the speed of light.<br>  <br>  Therefore, anything that is in the gravitational field falls into the black hole, including light (which is pulled by gravity).<br>  <br>  Black holes can have the mass equivalent to three suns (?) and up to several BILLION suns.  Incredible!<br>  <br>  We detect black holes in several ways:<br>  1) We see objects orbiting a "non-existent" central object<br>  2) As material is falling into the black hole, it heats up so much that it gives off x-rays<br>  3) There are two jets of material shooting away from the black hole from opposite sides (opposite poles?).|`|AJBR5P9daa	According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, a black hole is a region of space in which the gravitational field is so powerful that nothing, including electromagnetic radiation (e.g. visible light), can escape its pull after having fallen past its event horizon<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope it works for you.<br>  regards,<br>  pomegranate|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	Eliot's answer is good.<br>  <br>  there are a couple more interesting points.<br>  <br>  - not always, but in general, there are 2 classes of black hole "that we know of".<br>  1) a supermassive black hole that is at the center of every spiral galaxy.  it's that black hole that maintains order in the galaxy, much as the sun maintains order in our solar system, keeping all of the planets in stable orbits.<br>  2) a black hole that was created by the collapse of a very large star.  i've seen 2-3 solar masses mentioned here, but that's not nearly large enough.  3 or so solar masses can create a neutron star, not a black hole.  if i remember correctly, it takes 30-40 solar masses to have sufficient gravity to create a black hole.<br>  <br>  sorry, gotta go.<br>  <br>  btw, here is karam's reply.<br>  <a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/black_holes.html" rel="nofollow">http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/scienc...</a>|`|Uiab4hSaaa	Black holes are the evolutionary endpoints of stars at least 10 to 15 times as massive as the Sun. If a star that massive or larger undergoes a supernova explosion, it may leave behind a fairly massive burned out stellar remnant. With no outward forces to oppose gravitational forces, the remnant will collapse in on itself. The star eventually collapses to the point of zero volume and infinite density, creating what is known as a " singularity ". As the density increases, the path of light rays emitted from the star are bent and eventually wrapped irrevocably around the star. Any emitted photons are trapped into an orbit by the intense gravitational field; they will never leave it. Because no light escapes after the star reaches this infinite density, it is called a black hole.<br>  But contrary to popular myth, a black hole is not a cosmic vacuum cleaner. If our Sun was suddenly replaced with a black hole of the same mass, the earth's orbit around the Sun would be unchanged. (Of course the Earth's temperature would change, and there would be no solar wind or solar magnetic storms affecting us.) To be "sucked" into a black hole, one has to cross inside the Schwarzschild radius. At this radius, the escape speed is equal to the speed of light, and once light passes through, even it cannot escape.<br>  <br>  The Schwarzschild radius can be calculated using the equation for escape speed.<br>  <br>  <br>  vesc = (2GM/R)1/2<br>  <br>  For photons, or objects with no mass, we can substitute c (the speed of light) for Vesc and find the Schwarzschild radius, R, to be<br>  <br>  R = 2GM/c2<br>  If the Sun was replaced with a black hole that had the same mass as the Sun, the Schwarzschild radius would be 3 km (compared to the Sun's radius of nearly 700,000 km). Hence the Earth would have to get very close to get sucked into a black hole at the center of our solar system. <br>  <br>  If We Can't See Them, How Do We Know They're There?<br>  <br>  <br>  Since black holes are small (only a few to a few tens of kilometers in size), and light that would allow us to see them cannot escape, a black hole floating alone in space would be hard, if not impossible, to see. For instance, the photograph above shows the optical companion star to the (invisible) black hole candidate Cyg X-1.<br>  <br>  However, if a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter, or is close to another "normal" star, the black hole can accrete matter into itself. As the matter falls or is pulled towards the black hole, it gains kinetic energy, heats up and is squeezed by tidal forces. The heating ionizes the atoms, and when the atoms reach a few million degrees Kelvin, they emit X-rays. The X-rays are sent off into space before the matter crosses the Schwarzschild radius and crashes into the singularity. Thus we can see this X-ray emission.<br>  <br>  Binary X-ray sources are also places to find strong black hole candidates. A companion star is a perfect source of infalling material for a black hole. A binary system also allows the calculation of the black hole candidate's mass. Once the mass is found, it can be determined if the candidate is a neutron star or a black hole, since neutron stars always have masses of about 1.5 times the mass of the sun. Another sign of the presence of a black hole is random variation of emitted X-rays. The infalling matter that emits X-rays does not fall into the black hole at a steady rate, but rather more sporadically, which causes an observable variation in X-ray intensity. Additionally, if the X-ray source is in a binary system, the X-rays will be periodically cut off as the source is eclipsed by the companion star. When looking for black hole candidates, all these things are taken into account. Many X-ray satellites have scanned the skies for X-ray sources that might be possible black hole candidates.<br>  <br>  Cygnus X-1 is the longest known of the black hole candidates. It is a highly variable and irregular source with X-ray emission that flickers in hundredths of a second. An object cannot flicker faster than the time required for light to travel across the object. In a hundredth of a second, light travels 3000 kilometers. This is one fourth of Earth's diameter! So the region emitting the x-rays around Cygnus X-1 is rather small. Its companion star, HDE 226868 is a B0 supergiant with a surface temperature of about 31,000 K. Spectroscopic observations show that the spectral lines of HDE 226868 shift back and forth with a period of 5.6 days. From the mass-luminosity relation, the mass of this supergiant is calculated as 30 times the mass of the Sun. Cyg X-1 must have a mass of about 7 solar masses or else it would not exert enough gravitational pull to cause the wobble in the spectral lines of HDE 226868. Since 7 solar masses is too large to be a white dwarf or neutron star, it must be a black hole.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, there are arguments against Cyg X-1 being a black hole. HDE 226868 might be undermassive for its spectral type, which would make Cyg X-1 less massive than previously calculated. In addition, uncertainties in the distance to the binary system would also influence mass calculations. All of these uncertainties can make a case for Cyg X-1 having only 3 solar masses, thus allowing for the possibility that it is a neutron star.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, there are now about 10 binaries for which the evidence for a black hole is much stronger than in Cygnus X-1. The first of these, an X-ray transient called A0620-00, was discovered in 1975, and the mass of the compact object was determined in the mid-1980's to be greater than 3.5 solar masses. This very clearly excludes a neutron star, which has a mass near 1.5 solar masses, even allowing for all known theoretical uncertainties. The best case for a black hole is probably V404 Cygni, whose compact star is at least 10 solar masses. With improved instrumentation, the pace of discovery has accelerated over the last five years or so, and the list of dynamically confirmed black hole binaries is growing rapidly.

There is a good diagram at the referenced site showing the Moon phases and how they occur.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	It doesn't.  The moon is lit by the sun from different angles over the course of the month.  So you see the illuminated portion differently each night, but it's not changing shape.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The Moon doesn't really change its shape. In fact, the Moon hasn't changed very much in billions of years. The phases of the Moon are caused by the different angles at which the Moon is illuminated by the Sun.<br>  <br>  The Moon is a sphere which travels once around the Earth every 29 days. As it does so, it is illuminated from varying angles by the Sun. At New Moon, the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, so that the side of the Moon facing towards us receives no direct sunlight, and is only lit by dim sunlight reflected from the Earth. As it moves around the Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight.<br>  <br>  After a week, the Moon is 90° away from the Sun in the sky and is half illuminated, what we call First Quarter because it is about a quarter of the way around the Earth. <br>  <br>  A week after this, the Moon is 180° away from the Sun, so that Sun, Earth and Moon form a line. The Moon is fully illuminated by the Sun, so this is called Full Moon. The Earth's shadow points towards the Moon at this time, but usually the Moon passes above or below the shadow and no eclipse occurs.<br>  <br>  A week later the Moon has moved another quarter of the way around the Earth, to the Third Quarter position. The Sun's light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the Moon.<br>  <br>  Finally, a week later, the Moon is back to its New Moon starting position. Usually it passes above or below the Sun, but occasionally it passes right in front of the Sun, and we get an eclipse of the Sun.<br>  <br>  The Moon's phases are NOT caused by the shadow of the Earth falling on the Moon. In fact the shadow of the Earth only falls on the Moon twice a year when there is a lunar eclipse.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starrynight.com/sntimes/2009/feb/wwwgfx_cur/Moon_Phases_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.starrynight.com/sntimes/2009/...</a>|`|hOmSKJtdaa	The Moon's light is actually just The Sun's light reflecting off of The Moon's shiny surface.  <br>  So as the moon orbits around the earth different parts of it are lit up by the Sun.<br>  This website has a good animation which explains this phenomenon:<br>  <a href="http://www.fearofphysics.com/SunMoon/phases.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fearofphysics.com/SunMoon/pha...</a>|`|KqIDH7oVaa	it changes shape because it gets eaten by the moon monster and every month the moon fairy rebuilds it|`|GIH9JB04aa	Because the Earth eclipses some of the Sun's light which hits the Moon.|`|1iwOuIBeaa	The moon never changes shape, the sun hits it at different angles and it reflects the light to Earth, only one side of the moon is hit at one time the other side is in complete darkness and incredibly cold, making the phrase "the dark side of the moon"|`|C62F31Dwaa	It's just light from the sun reflecting back to earth, which to us makes it look different.
WkWedRnoaa	A light year is distance and does not correlate directly with actual years, which are time. The light we see from the GRB as being 12.2 billion light years away, did not take 12.2 billion years to reach us.<br>  <br>  Light from an object that we see at a distance of 4 light years left the object about four years ago. But light from objects that are billions of light years away is affected by the expansion of space (the universe is getting bigger) and by everything the light passes on its journey to us. <br>  <br>  As light leaves an object, it's photons travel in "straight" lines that are affected by matter and gravity. Matter such as solid objects (stars, planets, etc) can block the light, just as you do when you "see" anything, here on Earth or from space. The gravity produced by the matter, planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, can bend the path that the light takes.<br>  <br>  Light from an object that is far away at the time it is generated can travel billions of light years, which at the speed of light, corresponds to billions of years. BUT, while the light is travelling, the universe is expanding and the light gets "stretched" out along the way (red shift).<br>  Though light never exceeds the "speed of light", the distance that the light has travelled is determined by the amount of "stretching" (red shift) that it has undergone. When we finally see the light, we note its red shift and from that determine that the object is NOW 12.2 billion light years away from us. If the universe were not expanding, we could say that since the object is 12.2 billion light years away from us, it's light left 12.2 billion years ago, since it takes light one year to travel one light year. BUT the universe IS expanding, which allows light to look like it's travelling faster than the speed of light and thus, the object IS at 12.2 billion light years but it took less than 12.2 billion years for the light to reach us, so we are looking back in time to a point less than 12.2 billion years ago. I don't know the math, but it is theorectically possible to see light from objects at distances greater than 14 billion light years, even though the universe was created in the Big Bang only 13.7 billion years ago.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The light took 12.2 billion years to reach us, so this GRB happened back in the very early universe.  The speed of light is constant.|`|W2suykEtaa	i cannot understand why such a simple question, with such a simple answer warrants so many "thumbs-downs"?<br>  <br>  is there someone out there insulted by a light from 12.2 billion light-years away getting here after traveling 12.2 billion years?<br>  <br>  sheesh.<br>  <br>  go ahead and thumbs-down me, it tickles.<br>  <br>  (you should have seen the behavioral modification I had to go through for that!)|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	A Light Year is the distance light travels in one year.  That means it takes one year for light to travel one Light Year.  Which means it takes 12.2 billion years for light to travel 12.2 billion Light Years.  So, if the blast is 12.2 billion light years distant, that means it took the light from the blast 12.2 billion years to reach us.  And, that means the blast happened 12.2 billion years ago.<br>  .|`|cJPtKAU3aa	Well it already says how long it took that light to travel: 12.2 billion light years. If you want to calculate that huge number multiply, 12.2 billion by 5,800,000,000. Scientifically, it should take years, but it seems like the article is saying that it just came to us.|`|3443ca8928f42fd8cfd8b8d2964936d4aa	Hi.

j6dAbXCAaa	Logs are so strange! It's hard to do them. <br>  <br>  You don't divide by a log. When you have log x = -8.214, it's really log to the base 10 of x = -8.214, and that means:<br>  <br>  10^-8.214 = x , by the definition of a logarithm.<br>  <br>  So grab a calculator and do 10 to the -8.214 power, and that's x.<br>  <br>  Make sense?
l0Ojx5DCaa	You almost answer it yourself.<br>  <br>  Let the unknown distance be D. Let the kayak speed (with no current) be R.<br>  <br>  Upstream: 3(R - 6) = 3R - 18 = D<br>  Downstream: 2(R + 6) = 2R + 12 = D<br>  <br>  Since the distances are the same (though unknown), then:<br>  <br>  3R - 18 = 2R + 12. Solving for R (this is a linear equation), R = 30.<br>  <br>  Thus, the upsteam speed was (30 - 6) = 24 mph. Three hours at this pace is 72 miles. The downstream speed was (30 + 6) = 36 mph. 2 hours at this pace is also 72 miles.<br>  <br>  So, in answer to the question, the kayak goes 30 mph in still water.<br>  <br>  However, you and I both know that nobody paddles 30 mph in a kayak in still water.

Uiab4hSaaa	In the early 17th century, many scientists believed that there was no such thing as the "speed of light"; they thought light could travel any distance in no time at all. Galileo disagreed, and he came up with an experiment to measure light's velocity: he and his assistant each took a shuttered lantern, and they stood on hilltops one mile apart. Galileo flashed his lantern, and the assistant was supposed to open the shutter to his own lantern as soon as he saw Galileo's light. Galileo would then time how long it took before he saw the light from the other hilltop. <br>  <br>   And then he could just divide the distance by the time to get the speed. Did it work?    Nope. The problem was that the speed of light is simply too fast to be measured this way; light takes such a short time (about 0.000005 seconds, in fact) to travel one mile that there's no way the interval could have been measured using the tools Galileo had.  <br>  <br>   So what you'd need is a really long distance for the light to travel, like millions of miles. How could someone set up an experiment like that? <br>  <br>  <br>   Well...during the 1670's, the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer was making extremely careful observations of Jupiter's moon Io. The black dot is Io's shadow. Io makes one complete orbit around Jupiter every 1.76 days; the time it takes to make each orbit is always the same, so Roemer expected that he could predict its motion quite precisely. To his astonishment, he discovered that the moon didn't always appear where it was supposed to be. At certain times of the year, it seemed to be slightly behind schedule; at other times, it was slightly ahead.    <br>  <br>  Hubble Space Telescope image of Jupiter, its satellite Io and Io's shadow <br>  <br>   That's weird. Why would it orbit more quickly at some times and more slowly at others? <br>  <br>   That's exactly what Roemer wondered, and no one could think of any plausible answer. Roemer did notice, however, that Io seemed to be ahead of its predicted orbit when the earth was closer to Jupiter, and behind when it was farther away... <br>  <br>   This has got to have something to do with the speed of light, but I don't quite see how it all fits together. <br>  <br>   Well, think about this: if light doesn't travel infinitely fast, then it must take some amount of time to get from Jupiter to earth. Let's say it takes an hour. Then when you look at Jupiter through a telescope, what you're actually seeing is light that left an hour ago--so you're seeing what Jupiter and its moons looked like one hour in the past. <br>  <br>   Wait a second--I think I see where this is going. When Jupiter was farther away, light would take even longer to get from there to here, so that Roemer was seeing Io as it had been at an even earlier time than usual--maybe an hour and fifteen minutes ago, instead of an hour. And the opposite would happen when Jupiter and the earth were especially close together. So Io wasn't changing its orbit at all; it would just appear to be in different places depending on how long its light had taken to get here.    <br>  <br>   Very good! Now, knowing how much Io's timing seemed to change and how much the distance from earth to Jupiter varied, Roemer was able to calculate a value for the speed of light. The number he came up with was about 186,000 miles per second, or 300,000 kilometers per second.<br>  <br>  In the years that followed, as better equipment and techniques were developed, many other people were able to measure the speed of light more accurately. With the resources of today's technology, we can measure it to an incredibly high precision. For instance, astronauts have attached a mirror to a rock on the moon; scientists on earth can aim a laser at this mirror and measure the travel time of the laser pulse--about two and a half seconds for the round trip. (The idea behind this experiment is not so different from Galileo's, if you think about it...) And anyone who measures the speed of light, at any time, using any method, always gets the same result: just slightly less than 300,000 kilometers per second. <br>  <br>   Other kinds of electromagnetic radiation, like radio waves and microwaves, are supposed to travel at the same speed as light. Has their speed been measured also? <br>  <br>   Yes; in 1888, more than 200 years after Roemer's observations, Heinrich Hertz generated some electromagnetic waves in his laboratory. He measured their speed and came up with that familiar number, 300,000 kilometers per second--a very strong piece of evidence that light and electromagnetic radiation are the same thing.|`|Z3RvF86Qaa	The speed of light like any other speed is mesured in relation to the distance and time (Speed= Distance/Time. Example: 50miles/hour). Say one individual with watches set exactely at the same time stand from one another within a mile of distance, one turns on a flashlight at a specific moment in time. Then the other person indicates the exact moment when he saw the flashlight on. Apply the formula and that is how the speed of light can be determined.

Surprisingly though, the Law of Attraction has been repeatedly proven to work. It is one of the most basic laws of the universe that will affect your life whether you believe in it or not.<br>   The fundamental principle of the Law of Attraction is that everything in the universe emits certain vibrations. Entities emitting similar vibrations tend to be attracted to each other, and find a way to interact, regardless of their physical distance from one another.<br>   Have you heard that saying which goes, "Bad things happen in 3's." Well this is the Law of Attraction at work. Negative situations attract more of that type of situation.<br>   The reason that so many people seem to be wary of the Law of Attraction is that most discussions about it revolve around negativity. While the same frequency of applications occurs in good things, these do not receive much attention. For some reason, people tend to write off fortunate events as mere strokes of luck.<br>   The Law of Attraction and Luck<br>   For one thing, luck is purely a concept of people's imaginations. What people perceive as good luck or bad luck are actually manifestations of the law of attraction at work.<br>   The thing about the Law of Attraction is that it will happen and it will work whether you choose to believe in it or not. Everything that has happened and will happen in your life will be due a result of your present thoughts and actions. In other words, if you surround yourself with positive energy, the Law of Attraction will ensure that you will have a good and rewarding life.<br>   <br>   So what do you have to do? That's right, focus all your energies on positive thoughts, emotions, and actions to attract positive situations.<br>    For instance, if you keep thinking about your inadequate finances, you will find your resources dwindling more rapidly. If you stress too much about your job, you can end up with mental fatigue and reduced productivity. Focus on the bright side and you will soon find yourself in a much better situation.<br>   The next time you find yourself heading towards an abyss of negative thoughts, try to steer your mind towards pleasant ideas instead. If you are starting to worry about the coming bills, fill your mind with thoughts of money and wealth.<br>   There might be days when you feel desperately down and out of control of your life, but there will always be good things that you can be grateful for. Find these things and learn how to sincerely appreciate them.<br>   Of course, simply thinking about good things will not make them magically appear right in front of you. You do need to exert some effort and make positive changes. This is where the Law of Attraction can work once again. As soon as you think positively, your actions will soon follow suit and you will find yourself doing things that will soon get you out of your current bad situation.<br>   You are in control of your life, because of this fact you must take positive actions along with keeping positive thoughts. Taking responsibility for your own happiness is what makes the Law of Attraction thrive.<br>   By: Thomas Turner<br>   Article Directory: <a href="http://www.articledashboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com</a><br>    Want to learn more about the Law of Attraction?

What it means is that when you want a particular outcome, simply, get a really clear image of the end result you’re after, hold it in your mind for a few seconds and then let it go.? When we started the practice of doing this, it was shocking to both of us how little time you actually spend picturing things going the way you want them to and how much time you spend picturing things going wrong! <br>   <br>    Keep in mind, your brain is wired to protect you against harm.? So picturing the negative is something you are wired for, there is nothing wrong with that.? It doesn’t make you a pessimist or a negative person, but what does make the difference, is the person that acknowledges the risk or negative to a situation and then just as quickly sees the good in it and the action they choose to take as a result of it.? The difference between a positive or negative attitude isn’t that you have the bad thought; it’s how long you choose to dwell on it. ?Note I used the word “choose”, you choose your mental state, all day long, by what you choose to think about and the perspective you choose to hold and you make decisions and take action based on the perspective you hold.<br>   <br>   <br>   You create your own reality because your reality is simply your perspective on the world around you.<br>   Remember… You are always right, because your perspective is the only one you can hold.? If you believe you are Fat, it doesn’t matter whether you weigh 100 or 400 pounds; your perspective is that you are Fat.? If you cannot remain open minded to seeing yourself as skinny, then it’s impossible to ever be skinny, at least in your mind’s eye.<br>   <br>   <br>   So how does seeing it perfect work?? I’ll use exercise as an example, because that’s what I do best!? When I participate in an important race, I take a moment to create an image of the end result.? If you were training for a race here’s what I would encourage you to add to your training program:? Picture yourself coming across the finish line and the emotion you would like to experience at that time.? Get a good picture of yourself doing that, if you want family and friends, there, then picture them cheering for you.? Now tie that picture to the emotion that you want to experience, in other words, If you would like to feel proud of yourself and full of energy and refreshed as you cross the finish line, picture that.? What will you be saying to yourself as you cross? “I knew I could do it” or “that was easier then I expected”.? Tie all that together in a quick little snap shot.? And now you’ve done it, you’ve “pictured it perfect”.? Now just relax and let it go.? You no longer have to keep the picture running in your mind, you don’t have to add to it or think about it anymore.? But what I do want you to do is notice how often your mind wanders and daydreams about things going wrong.? When that happens, just release the thought and note to yourself that you have already “pictured it perfect” and there is no reason to worry, you’ve set your intention in motion, now it’s up to the universe to make it happen.<br>   <br>   <br>   Now here’s the crazy part, there can be no strings attached.? What you pictured, is the end result, how you get there is no longer in your hands.? You have to let that part go.? Let me tell you a story of how Tony and I melted an engine.? We were flying from St. Maarten to LA with a change of plane in Fort Lauderdale and were scheduled to arrive home at 10:00pm.? As usual we were re-routed due to bad weather and had to land in Fort Meyers, to refuel, which meant we were going to miss our connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale.? We were so bummed, because we really wanted to get home.? So we started “Seeing it as perfect”.? We took a couple minutes to each visualize landing safely and happily in L.A. by midnight that night.? And then we just let it go. No strings attached, I didn’t care how it happened, just end up in L.A. safe and happy, today.? Really long story short we made it because the plane we were supposed to catch in Fort Lauderdale had something fly into one of the engines and melt, before it could take off.? And while it posed no threat to anyone on board, the smell was so bad that they had to de-board all the passengers from the plane and clean it so that the stench could dissipate.? While all this was going on Tony and I had no idea, we just kept going through security and customs as if we were still going to get on our plane,
FUVakx3yaa	Western blots can have lots of technical difficulties.  You didn't mention what your primary or secondary antibodies were.   For sake of argument, let's assume the primary is a rabbit anti-potassium channel Kv4.3 and the secondary is a mouse anti-rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase.  I would first test the secondary antibody and the reagents to make sure they work by dot- or slot-blotting various dilutions of the primary and then applying the secondary and then running your detection system. and make sure that the reagents work.  You can do this with membranes and all the reagents that you will use to try to detect the protein on the gel.  Then, if you have enough of the protein, try to detect it on a dot- or slot-blot using the primary Ab, secondary Ab, and detection reagents.  Then, when you know your assay is working, then throw in the complication of running the protein on the gel, transferring the protein from the gel to the nitrocellulose (or other) membrane and then running your detection system on the membrane-bound protein.  That way, at least you know your detection system works and you can narrow it down to possibilities such as these:  there isn't any protein in the tissue or there isn't any protein in the extract, or perhaps the extract was diluted too much, the protein migrates down the gel but doesn't get transferred to the membrane, or the protein isn't able to be detected on the membrane due to being washed off or perhaps the antigenic site is hidden for some reason.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Los vientos globales se generan como consecuencia del desplazamiento del aire desde zonas de alta presión a zonas de baja presión, determinando los vientos dominantes de una área o región. Aún así hay que tener en cuenta numerosos factores locales que influyen o determinan los caracteres de intensidad y periodicidad de los movimientos del aire. Estos factores, difíciles de simplificar por su multiplicidad, son los que permiten hablar de vientos locales, los cuales son en muchos lugares más importantes que los de carácter general. Estos tipos de vientos son los siguientes:<br>  <br>      * Brisas marinas<br>      * Brisas de valle<br>      * Brisas de monta?a<br>      * Vientos catabáticos. Vientos que descienden desde las alturas al fondo de los valles producido por el deslizamiento al ras de suelo del aire frió y denso desde los elementos del relieve más altos. Aparecen de forma continuada en los grandes glaciares, adquiriendo enormes proporciones en los inlandsis de Groenlandia y de la Antártida, donde soplan a velocidades continuas que superan los 200 km/h motivado por la ausencia de obstáculos que frenen su aceleración.<br>      * Vientos anabáticos. Vientos que ascienden desde las zonas más bajas hacia las más altas a medida que el sol calienta el relieve.<br>  <br>  El viento actúa como agente de transporte en efecto, interviene en la polinización anemófila, en el desplazamiento de las semillas. Es también un agente erosivo.<br>  <br>  La velocidad o intensidad de los vientos suele medirse utilizando la Escala de Beaufort.|`|5967d2200af4036338c16013bbe85492aa	El viento:<br>  Es el movimiento del aire en la atmósfera con relación a la superficie terrestre, originado por la diferente densidad de masas de aire que se encuentran a distinta temperatura. En meteorología se denomina como tal la componente del movimiento del aire paralela a la superficie terrestre.

16c3aa01501e7a31a4b934839a2cf65baa	well the item you are testing is your topic. The hypothesis is what you are testing about. These are necessary because without it you are doing no experiment.<br>  <br>        Conservation of energy states that the total amount of energy (often expressed as the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy) in an isolated system remains constant. In other words, energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. In modern physics, all forms of energy exhibit mass and all mass is a form of energy.<br>  When a piece of copper metal is heated in air, it comes together with oxygen in the air. Then if it is weighed, it is found to have a greater mass that the original piece of metal. If however the mass of the oxygen of the air that combines with the metal is taken into consideration, it can be shown that the mass of the product is within the limits of accuracy of any weighing instrument, equal to the sum of the masses of the copper and oxygen that combine. This behavior of matter is in accord with what is called the Law of Conservation of Matter: During an ordinary chemical change, there is no detectable increase or decrease in the quantity of matter.<br>  Conversion of one type of matter into another are always accompanied by the conversion of one form of energy into another. Usually heat is leveled or absorbed, but sometimes the conversion involves light or electrical energy instead of, or in addition to heat. Many transformations of energy, of course, do not involve chemical changes. Electrical energy can be changed into either mechanical, light, heat or potential energy without chemical changes. Mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy in a generator. Potential and kinetic energy can be converted into one another. Many other conversions are possible, but all of the energy involved in any change always appears in some form after the change is completed.|`|4ac2a5ba15c97ead9b793efbf88dcdd5aa	You need to have as few variables as possible that will influence the experiment.........whether or not your hypothesis is correct is irrelevant....so why change it?!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This is a pretty good question. And the answer is, in one sense, scientists do this. <br>  <br>  So, you start an experiment with a hypothesis - that is, an idea which you are trying to determine either true or false. But as you are doing the experiment it becomes obvious that it is really true.... OK, why continue on... but there might be something else interesting that has shown up, so you continue the experiment to be sure that you find out about that interesting new idea. <br>  <br>  OK, is that changing the hypothesis, or did you really just finish the first experiemnt early and start a new one! <br>  <br>  In real science this might happen like this..<br>  <br>  Suppose you had a new medicine and you thought it would cure lung cancer. OK. you get a bunch of guys with lung cancer and you try to split them into two groups so the two groups are the same as much as possible. You figure you will give one group the new experimental medicine and the other group gets some standard medicine that you already tested before.  You plan to keep all the patients on the medicine for three months....<br>  <br>  But then, at the end of the first month half of the patients who get the new medicine died, and none of the patients with the old standard medicine? What are you going to do, keep on giving them the new medicine? <br>  <br>  Or, what if it worked the other way.... after two months half the standard medicine guys died, and only 1/10th of the new experimental medicine guys died? Then what would you do. <br>  <br>  It would be highly unethical to continue an experiment where you knew that some of the people you were working with were dying unnecessarily.

A greater atomic radius corresponds to either a weaker core charge or a greater shielding effect from inner shell electrons. Both of these results in a weaker attractive force experienced by the valence electrons.

Hence, the greater the atomic radius, the weaker the electronegativity.|`|839c1e3225fff69990dd7d53185494f3aa	atomic radius is inversely proportional to electronegativity...i.e.as atomic radius increases electronegativity decreases...|`|d3f5ca3677879ae23b15d03a8c08bd43aa	electronegetivity is the ability to pull electrons towards the nucleaus....so the smaller the atomic radius the stronger the electronegetivity of an element|`|f18ad8029aed2c462c52a90f16652a6caa	electronegativty is a poperty to attract sharing  bonding electron pair towards itself. it has no relation ship as radius of atom.|`|AA11814642	inversely proportional|`|ee88f4fe5e0e78abcba8f12edcbc236daa	it's like having beef kipper and turkey jerky.
d426665fee0df1d75adc7ab26f22bb2caa	A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is used to look at the surface of solid objects. The object you are looking at must be coated with an electron dense material - usually a very fine coating of gold. Electrons are fired at the object, reflecting off the surface and are then collected to form a 3-D image. The object itself is mounted on a small stage that can be rotated around so that you can look at different side and zoom in.<br>  <br>  A Transmission Electron Microscope is used to look at the internal structure of material. This is done by 'staining' the material with an electron dense substance (often Osmium) and then the material is sliced up very thinly ( a few nanometres). Electrons are fired at the slice (which is mounted on a very fine copper grid) - some go through and some do not.

If it is necessary, heating can be carried out with relatively high heating rates. The RF technique is used for the heating of electrically non-conductive materials and works after the same principle as the microwave oven. Utilizing the low-frequent RF waves (frequency of 3 to 50 MHz), larger volumes (such as contaminated soil) can be treated. With this principle, the RF method is able to in situ reach contaminants which are deep buildings or other sealed surfaces. The method can be utilized at temperatures between -20°C and 400°C.<br>  <br>  Potential application (studied in the working group) are e.g. support of microbial degradation of pollutants and the thermodesorption or sequestration of pollutants as bound residues in the soil matrix. <br>  <br>  now uses on radio waves:<br>  Uses of Radio Waves:<br>  The prime purpose of radio is to convey information from one place to another through the intervening media (i.e., air, space, nonconducting materials) without wires. Besides being used for transmitting sound and television signals, radio is used for the transmission of data in coded form. In the form of radar it is used also for sending out signals and picking up their reflections from objects in their path. Long-range radio signals enable astronauts to communicate with the earth from the moon and carry information from space probes as they travel to distant planets (see space exploration). For navigation of ships and aircraft the radio range, radio compass (or direction finder), and radio time signals are widely used. Radio signals sent from global positioning satellites can also be used by special receivers for a precise indication of position (see navigation satellite). Digital radio, both satellite and terrestrial, provides improved audio clarity and volume. Various remote-control devices, including rocket and artificial satellite operations systems and automatic valves in pipelines, are activated by radio signals. The development of the transistor and other microelectronic devices (see microelectronics) led to the development of portable transmitters and receivers. Cellular and cordless telephones are actually radio transceivers. Many telephone calls routinely are relayed by radio rather than by wires; some are sent via radio to relay satellites. Some celestial bodies and interstellar gases emit relatively strong radio waves that are observed with radio telescopes composed of very sensitive receivers and large directional antennas (see radio astronomy).|`|AA11759897	Go back to the Cristal set the radio wave vibrated the Cristal and through a coil and a tuning condenser ( a variable condenser consisting of movable plates 8 or 10  that interacted with fixed plates 9 or 11 ) a signal could be tuned into. it gets very complicated because we have Carrier waves that can handle waves of different frequency they are then split up by the receiver for example video and audio and this keeps them as near as together. if they were sent separately the mouth would move out of time with the sound.( bit like a woman)|`|49875d75cb13f4bdd3bb4665982a632baa	The main use of radio waves is communication.

Then we would be able to use out ears to detect those vibrations.

Otra característica es que se trata de cuerpos esféricos y grandes en tama?o y “otra razón es que existen órbitas casi circulares alrededor del Sol y éstas están aproximadamente en el mismo plano”.<br>  <br>  <br>  Plutón fue descubierto en 1930, precisa de la Herrán, no existían los medios para conocer con exactitud sus características. “Al descubrirse se le llamó planeta porque era planeta o estrella y decidió llamársele planeta”. <br>  <br>  <br>  Con el paso del tiempo y con el análisis de este planeta, se tuvo la certeza de que su órbita no es circular y está muy inclinada “o sea no está en el plano de los demás planetas”, razones suficientes para definirlo de otra manera. <br>  <br>  <br>  Con motivo de la XXVI asamblea general de la Unión Astronómica Internacional (UAI) realizada en Praga, agrega el experto, se determinó luego de largas e intensos debates que se redefiniera y con ello se reduce el número de planetas en el Sistema Solar de nueve a ocho. <br>  <br>  Pongamos un ejemplo, dice de la Herrán, “un vaso y una taza sirven para lo mismo, pero no son lo mismo, tienen nombres diferentes porque tienen distinta forma y concepto”.<br>  <br>  <br>  Para los estudiantes y los profesores que aprenden y explican el Sistema Solar “no será necesario realizar nuevos gráficos porque Plutón no cambia de tama?o, ni de lugar, ni de nombre sólo existe una redefinición y ya no será llamado planeta, los cuales pasan de nueve a ocho".|`|442300a3e1119aa4b2a781a70b62152eaa	PORQUE DESCUBRIERON QUE NO TENIA LA CAPACIDAD Y DESARROLLO PARA SER UN PLANETA|`|6f7bcc4601ec0ab0f2b81cea24c648d8aa	porque se vio que su orbita es mas parecida a la de un cometa que a la de un planeta, con el timepo ha ido alejandose cada vez mas, por lo que se considero que fue un error tomarlo como un planeta.|`|917d3d685539a84c341f708fa4849710aa	jajaja<br>  <br>  <br>  no manches almeja<br>  <br>  <br>  apenas te enteraste<br>  <br>  <br>  te pasas|`|FapGMAxDaa	Por la misma razón que a los hombres que pierden el titulo de machos los llaman putones.

usU9Az4laa	Por biomimética se conoce la ciencia de emular el funcionamiento de organismos vivos a través de ingenios mecánicos o robóticos, tal y como explica Francisco Vico, profesor Asociado en la Facultad de Informática de la Universidad de Málaga.<br>  <br>  El diario New York Times sitúa esta ciencia de actualidad. Scott Kirsner escribe sobre la langosta robótica del Dr. Joseph Ayers, capaz de moverse por el fondo marino y de gran interés para la oficina de Investigación Naval, que financia sus actividades en la Universidad de Boston. Su robolangosta es parte de una nueva generación de robots que utilizan la emulación de distintos animales vivos para desarrollar actividades que hasta ahora habían estado vetadas para un robot tradicional.<br>  <br>  Este campo utiliza el mimetismo con animales como langostas, moscas, perros, peces, serpientes, lagartos ocucarachas para ir más allá de lo que ha sido posible hasta ahora en el manejo de robots, dise?ados para tareas como la asistencia al ser humano en la búsqueda de personas desaparecidas en un terremoto u otro tipo de catástrofe natural. Esta es precisamente la especialidad de Howie Choset, de la universidad Carnagie Mellon, que está desarrollando un ingenio, a medio camino entre trompa de elefante y serpiente, especialmente dotado para este tipo de tareas de búsqueda.<br>  <br>  Es obvio que la naturaleza ha tardado millones de a?os en desarrollar algunas de las características de estos seres vivos, por lo que los investigadores no tienen fácil crear imitaciones en laboratorios. A pesar de la aparición del perro robot japonés Aibo, desarrollado en 1999 por los ingenieros de Sony, los expertos consideran que todavía están a a?os de distancia de conseguir robots que sean fieles réplicas de sus modelos reales.<br>  <br>  La próxima vez que sse tope con una cucaracha, piénseselo dos veces antes de azotarla con la zapatilla. Podría estar aplastando un prodigio de la tecnología.

Research in the human stem cell field grew out of findings by Canadian scientists Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till in 1957.<br>  <br>  The two categories of human stem cells are embryonic stem cells, derived from blastocysts, and adult stem cells, derived from umbilical cord blood or bone marrow.[1] In a blastocyst of a developing embryo, stem cells differentiate into all of the specialised embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells. As stem cells can be readily grown and transformed into specialized tissues such as muscles or nerves through cell culture, their use in medical therapies has been proposed.|`|c5ef297ab29e6764fbc624812752dd66aa	Check out this entry in Wikipedia:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell</a><br>  <br>  and look under the heading "Key events in stem cell research."

727758f7046dcfa88af9d0c3c2dfdbbdaa	Las opciones para eliminar un tatuaje son: La Cirugía, La Dermoabrasión y el Láser.<br>     La excisión quirúrgica esta indicada en caso de tatuajes peque?os sobre pieles delgadas pero siempre dejan una cicatriz.<br>     La Dermoabrasión consiste en "lijar la piel"mediante instrumento mecánico rotatorio (como una fuerza o cepillo metálico) y puede dejar un área pálida o una cicatriz. Luego de varios tratamientos el tatuaje puede permanecer visible porque dependerá su eliminación total de la profundidad a que hayan sido colocados los gránulos de pigmentos en el momento del tatuaje. Aquellos que sobrepasen la Dermis no podrán ser eliminados.<br>     El Láser ha llegado a ser el tratamiento de elección. Este vaporiza rápidamente la tinta del tatuaje, mediante el calentamiento conduce a que la tinta se expanda y se rompa en microscópicas partículas. El cuerpo es capaz de absorver estos peque?os fragmentos y luego eliminarlos por medio de la orina. Este tratamiento produce un Discomfort mediano, como si se tuviese una banda de goma amarrada a la piel. El Discomfort es bien tolerado cuando son áreas peque?as, pero en caso contrario puede interferir con el procedimiento. La aplicación de hielo previo al procedimiento es de gran ayuda, en el alivio de las molestias. Por lo general el tratamiento no requiere de sedación, analgésicos o anestesia local.<br>  Múltiples Tratamientos son Necesarios.<br>     Es necesario un láser para cada tipo de color. Para eliminar tatuajes con múltiples colores más de 2 sesiones pueden ser requeridas. Por ejemplo si hay tres colores relacionados en un tatuaje, cada familia de colores deben ser tratados 3 veces para un total de 9 sesiones. Algunos tatuajes requieren hasta 20 sesiones para ser completamente eliminados. Otros factores también determinan el número de sesiones. Los tatuajes de figuras o animales son difíciles de eliminar porque por lo general son mezcla de pigmentos, oscuros, y colocados a su nivel profundo de la piel (tatuajes profesionales). Los realizados por aficionados los resultados son impredecibles porque los pigmentos no son uniformemente colocados y se desconoce el tipo de pigmento. Los tatuajes nuevos son difíciles de eliminar porque tiene mayor concentración de tinta que un tatuaje viejo. Los tatuajes viejos tienen menor cantidad de pigmentos porque el organismo los va absorbiendo progresivamente. Los tatuajes turquesas son particularmente difíciles de remover porque el Láser no funciona bien con este color. Los rojos, blanco y color carne son medianamente dificultosos y pueden volverse negro luego del tratamiento. El número de tratamientos necesarios no puede ser establecido a priori. El rango es entre 6 y 12 sesiones. Cada sesión puede llevarse a cabo cada 1 o 2 meses y prolongarse por a?os. Los tatuajes comenzarán a disminuir su tonalidad, a partir de los 7 días luego de cada sesión y continuará desapareciendo por varios meses. Algunos abandonan el tratamiento para ahorrar dinero luego de unos meses de iniciarlo. Otros insisten hasta eliminar todo vestigio del mismo.<br>     Algunas personas deciden colocar un nuevo tatuaje sobre el indeseado; .

This means O must be the only odd number in {0,1,2} . So O = 1<br>  <br>  Looking at the fourth digit column, this means that A*4 ends in 8 (as when the 3 is carried over the result is 1).

AA11514184	Advantages and Disadvantages of Laser Use in Medicine <br>  Lasers have several advantages over standard surgical tools: <br>  <br>  Lasers are more precise than scalpels. Tissue near an incision is protected, since there is little contact with surrounding skin or other tissue.<br>  <br>  The heat produced by lasers sterilizes the surgery site, thus reducing the risk of infection.<br>  <br>  Less operating time may be needed because the precision of the laser allows for a smaller incision.<br>  <br>  Healing time is often shortened; since laser heat seals blood vessels, there is less bleeding, swelling, or scarring.<br>  <br>  Laser surgery may be less complicated. For example, with fiber optics, laser light can be directed to parts of the body without making a large incision.<br>  <br>  More procedures may be done on an outpatient basis. <br>  <br>  <br>  There are also disadvantages with laser surgery: <br>  <br>  Relatively few surgeons are trained in laser use. <br>  <br>  Laser equipment is expensive and bulky compared with the usual surgical tools, such as scalpels.<br>  <br>  Strict safety precautions must be observed in the operating room. (For example, the surgical team and the patient must use eye protection.)<br>  <br>  Treating Cancer With Lasers<br>  <br>  Lasers can be used in two ways to treat cancer: by shrinking or destroying a tumor with heat, or by activating a chemical -- known as a photosensitizing agent -- that destroys cancer cells. In PDT, a photosensitizing agent is retained in cancer cells and can be stimulated by light to cause a reaction that kills cancer cells. <br>  <br>  CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers are used to shrink or destroy tumors. They may be used with endoscopes, tubes that allow physicians to see into certain areas of the body, such as the bladder. The light from some lasers can be transmitted through a flexible endoscope fitted with fiber optics. This allows physicians to see and work in parts of the body that could not otherwise be reached except by surgery and therefore allows very precise aiming of the laser beam. Lasers also may be used with low-power microscopes, giving the doctor a clear view of the site being treated. Used with other instruments, laser systems can produce a cutting area as small as 200 microns in diameter -- less than the width of a very fine thread. <br>  <br>  Lasers are used to treat many types of cancer. Laser surgery is a standard treatment for certain stages of glottis (vocal cord), cervical, skin, lung, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers. <br>  <br>  In addition to its use to destroy the cancer, laser surgery is also used to help relieve symptoms caused by cancer (palliative care). For example, lasers may be used to shrink or destroy a tumor that is blocking a patient's trachea (windpipe), making it easier to breathe. It is also sometimes used for palliation in colorectal and anal cancer.|`|AA11250300	what lasers?|`|2b566fd738c67ffc44611c6e45eb91f5aa	Advantages<br>  Cool as hell<br>  Work great on the heads of your shark henchmen<br>  Great for certain industrial tasks<br>  <br>  Disadvantages<br>  Expensive <br>  Not as effective as drills or bullets<br>  Can cause blindness in the user or those you use them on

AA10601763	Yes, I believe that in large part, humans have lasted so long because of their ability to adapt to many varied circumstances through resourcefulness and tolerance.<br>  <br>  I think that ideally, we would be very open and tolerant - enough that we might eventually be open enough to each other to become telepathic.  We would listen, and not fend for superiority so much.  The most infintesimal animals fight for survival - we have slowly evolved not to do this, but to reason against it - this is part of why we have lived so long as a humanoid race - we collaborate; commune. Animalia has slowly been tending toward this trend.<br>  <br>  (Anecdote) I had a best friend once, who was so close, we could say anything, be anything, to and with each other - we trusted each other totally and were completely open... eventually we started to finish each other's sentences... think the same things at the same time.  We started to experiment with this, and found we could receive images from one another... and then we began to practice, and eventually - could communicate - or at least tell what the other was thinking.  Sometimes we could even receive the answers from others' minds in school during tests.  This ability required total trust - in my friend's acceptance, in her own honesty about what she thought and saw - and that acceptance and honesty required a lack of competition - of blocking, of  proving wrong - it required collaboration.<br>  <br>  I think, however, that since the population of violent and competitive people in this world is not a) killing each other off, or b) unable to survive because of mental issues - we are not evolving toward this trust and understanding.<br>  <br>  We are in a period of stasis.   However, I think that very slowly, through time, as periods of warlords die and we become secure in life and happiness (more so), we are moving toward understanding others, and helping, not competing.<br>  <br>  I know my friends and I bridge a gap that many people don't bridge... so maybe there will be more evolution to come.  Who knows?<br>  <br>  Emma|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Evolution will continue.  "Fit" will be redefined.|`|0e2af3c0f8ef9113605eb069f26db7c4aa	I don't think medicine and technology has as much to do with it as the societies we've developed do. <br>  We certainly are still evolving, although I would say in a different way.  Our evolution is not as much about physical survival, and more about social survival.  It all has to do with breeding, and we select our mates in a different way now than we did back when we had to either find or kill our food or die.  <br>  But, on the other hand, there are still many human features that are instinctually attractive to us.  <br>  In the end, evolution is too slow a process to see more than general trends over the span of one lifetime.  And there are still plenty of things out there to cause the random mutations and differences that evolution is based on.  I personally have a theory that all the new preservatives in the food we've been eating in the past 50-90 years may already be causing long term effects.  The age of puberty is dropping, for example.  <br>  Just food for thought...|`|1158ac96736eadc6ea7d3daaec093ff2aa	If so, it would be just one of many aspects of the polypotency of technology (the multiple and/or unintended effects of technology). Your theory is difficult to test as there is no viable means of comparison; we cannot evolve in two seperate but complete worlds for centuries and compare the two in any reasonable fashion.<br>  <br>  From the types of birth "defects" typically operated on, the human would (in most cases) be better off with the "fix" than without. In this manner, the defects that are removed are ones which are mostly negative and would only contribute to a "worse" human being in our society. Medicine works to prolong the lives of those alive, but not to alter our DNA so-as-to strip evolutionary benefits (at least not yet).<br>  <br>  Worse problems arise from lead pollution in inner cities (1/3 of all inner city children have enough lead in their blood to retard development or lower intelligence), self perscribed social insignificance as a result of the true understanding of the vast size of the world (internet/mass media -> true grasp of 6+ billion people -> you don't matter at all -> you can make bad decisions *i.e. pour motor oil down sewage drain* without making a difference since there are so many other people), or even something as simple as fast food (contributing to obesity and heart problems along with many stress related issues).<br>  <br>  Consider the number of people that have died in feuds about gasoline to date. The motives for wars have changed from differing origins & beliefs to differing resources & social categories. The collective effect of possible unintended (often negative) consequences of our emerging technologies approaches infinity.

Ok, now I assume you know how to do basic algebra. Pretend the arrow is an equals (=) sign. You want to have to same number of every element on each side. <br>  For example, in 'a', you have three carbons (C) on the left and only one on the right. If you give it the compound CO2 the coefficient of '3', you now have the same number of carbons on each side. Leave the subscripted numbers alone, they do not change. <br>  Now, you do have to deal with those numbers. You multiply the coefficients with the subscripts to find out how many there are. If you see no number in front, it is a '1'. And remember that '3' we just added, multiply that by the '2' to get '6' oxygens (O) on the right.<br>  <br>  Just do that for all your compounds! If it helps, keep tally off to the side so you know how many you have on each side. Good luck!

491e3d836819bf014ff5701ec520d80caa	Iron is an element.... Steel is a combination of two elements: carbon and iron. Iron rusts, carbon doesn't. <br>  <br>  The simple answer: elemental iron has more iron atoms in it than steel, so there are more atoms available for oxygen to combine with (causing rust.)<br>  <br>  The more complicated answer has to do with the fact that iron and steel are actually crystals. Depending on the iron and carbon content of the steel, and the temperature and pressure, steel can have many different crystal structures. (For example, a simple cube, or a cube with an atom in the center, etc)<br>  <br>  Carbon and iron can intermix with each other to different degrees in different physical environments. So, depending on the way in which they mix and crystallize, the steel can be more or less susceptible to oxidation (rust.)<br>  <br>  If you're interested in this kind of thing, look up Fe-C phase diagram, or just phase diagrams in general.|`|e68d361eee76a2e57897a805d9dc602faa	steel contains iron as well as other elements such as carbon (stainless steel also contains nickel and chromium).

More active metals will replace less active metals in their compounds, so, if copper is more active than aluminum, you will find that absolutely nothing happens.  If aluminum is more active than copper, the aluminum will dissapear and be replaced by copper (you will see a red/brown coating or powder appear on the aluminum surface.

roxi2DZEaa	I smell a paper due tomorrow.  First off, wikipedia-ing "frame of reference" could provide detail, assuming you're writing a paper.  <br>  Now for a brief explanation.  Inertia is, in layman's terms, motion.  A common example of inertial frame of reference is when you're on a train.  If you've been on a train, looking out the window will show things as they are from an inertial frame of reference.  However, if the train were to maintain an exactly steady speed, without bumps, wind resistance, or any other kind of noticeable friction, then an observer within it would believe that they were standing still (under one condition).  The condition is that the windows of the train are  closed, and given that all these conditions are satisfied the observer would be left with a non-inertial frame of reference.

3c47ef3d892937a1378d47c2f83ce4d3aa	Respondida pela 9o vez<br>  <br>  Apesar de as moléculas triat?micas do oz?nio ser um gás azul-claro na temperatura ambiente, n?o há rela??o entre este fato e a cor azul do céu.<br>  <br>  A primeira explica??o fundamentada para a cor azul do céu foi dado pelo físico inglês John Tyndall (1820-1893), em 1869 [Philosophical Magazine 37(250); 38(253), pgs. 384; 156] e 1870 (Philosophical Transactions of Royal Society of London 160), ao estudar o espalhamento de um feixe de luz por um meio contendo pequenas partículas suspensas. Ele observou que uma sala cheia de fuma?a ou de poeira torna visível um feixe de luz que, repentinamente, nela penetre. Ao notar um azulamento em um feixe de luz que atravessou um nevoeiro ("smog") formado por uma rea??o fotoquímica que estava realizando, escreveu em seu Caderno de Notas: Associo este azul com a cor do céu. A partir daí suas pesquisas sempre procuravam uma associa??o entre qualquer colora??o azul em nevoeiros e a cor do céu. Essa observa??o de Tyndall, hoje conhecida como efeito Tyndall, fez com que o mundo científico o considere como o cientista que demonstrou a raz?o do azul do céu. Mas esta explica??o era apenas qualitativa, era necessário uma explica??o quantitativa, que foi conseguida pelo físico inglês John William Strutt, Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919; PNF, 1904), em 1871 [Philosophical Magazine 41(4), p. 107]. Em sua explica??o, o descobridor do arg?nio (A), demonstrou que a intensidade (I) da luz espalhada por gases é proporcional à quarta potência da freqüência (n) da luz considerada [ou inversamente proporcional à quarta potência do comprimento de onda (l), pois ln = c, onde c é a velocidade da luz no vácuo], e assim, explicou de uma só vez a cor azul do céu e o vermelho do por e do nascer do Sol. Com efeito, como o azul tem uma das maiores freqüências das cores do espectro luminoso, a atmosfera terrestre espalha mais azul do que as demais cores do espectro luminoso. (Aqui cabe uma observa??o, pois a cor de maior freqüência daquele espectro é o violeta, porém, como nosso órg?o visual á mais sensível ao azul do que ao violeta, vemos apenas o azul.) No caso do nascer e do por do Sol, sua cor avermelhada decorre do fato de que, nessas duas situa??es, os raios solares incidem tangencialmente à superfície de nosso planeta, ent?o as cores de maior freqüência s?o bastante espalhadas para cima do horizonte ficando, deste modo, apenas a vermelha, que é a cor de menor freqüência do espectro luminoso.|`|66fed7974f5281b59150d9ed4a9dff08aa	A luz do Sol, que a ti parece branca é, na verdade, constituída por sete cores entre elas o azul. Estas s?o vistas quando aparece o arco-íris. O que acontece é o seguinte: quando a luz solar atinge a atmosfera da Terra, o azul separa-se das outras cores e espalha-se no ar. Como existe mais azul que as restantes, só vemos essa cor quando olhamos para o céu.|`|530fa2b6810ce8a05915c2db38868db9aa	A luz solar é formada por vários comprimentos de ondas. os maiores comprimentos de onda da luz visível formam a cor vermelha e os menores, a violeta. Assim, como a atmosfera terrestre possui partículas em suspens?o e umidade, a luz sofre um processo conhecido como dispers?o. Ocorre que as ondas de menor frequência s?o mais facilmente absorvidas pela atmosfera. as ondas de maior frequência s?o menos absorvidas, chegando mais facilmente ao solo. Essas ondas s?o predominantemente da frequência equivalente à cor azul. Mas surge a pergunta: se a cor violeta possui uma frequencia de onda ainda maior que o azul, ent?o por que n?o vemos um céu violeta? Isso se deve ao fato de que o Sol produz muito pouca luz nesse espectro, sendo o azul muito preponderante ao violeta.<br>  Em Marte, em que a atmosfera é bem menos densa que a da Terra, os raios vermelhos e amarelos permeiam mais facilmente o ar. Assim, o céu marciano é alaranjado, n?o azul.<br>  Em um planeta onde a atmosfera fosse muito mais densa que a Terrestre, o inverso ocorreria, e teríamos um céu escuro, com predomínio da cor violeta.<br>  Se orbitássemos uma estrela mais fria, vermelha, o nosso céu dificilmente seria azul, mas alaranjado, posto que essa estrela produziria pouca luz na cor azul.|`|9743f044fa0e1f60889eb440fee4637eaa	Evandro, n?o é nenhuma besteira n?o.<br>  Na verdade a explica??o mais simples seria devido ao condensamento de gases e também relativo ao comprimento de ondas que conseguimos enchergar.

Essa mistura difrata a luz solar na cor azul.<br>  Em Marte, onde a composi??o da atmosfera tem menos nitrogênio e muito mais CO2 o céu é cor de rosa.<br>  Isso também acontece com o mar, mas de forma diferente. Você já reparou que o mar pode ser azul, verde, turqueza, acinzantado e oum monte de misturas disso ? Isso porque a temperatura e a composi??o química predominante em cada área é diferente.|`|23541fbdfd199088f2bddb19cf7c5fa7aa	Sabemos que a luz é formada por diversas cores. Ao atravessar a atmosfera, ela se espalha devido às partículas existents no ar, porém as ondas de cada cor espalham-se de forma diferente, dependendo do seu comprimento de onda. Quanto mais curta, mais dispersas elas se tronam. O comprimento da onda azul faz com que ela se espalhe o suficiente para dar ao céu a tonalidade que vemos. Já no final da tarde, o Sol ilumina obliquamente, obrigando os raios a fazerem um caminho mais longo para chegar à Terra. Tal facto dispersa quase totalmente a luz azul e torna visível a vermelha, que possui um comprimento de onda maior. é isso que nos dá o espectáculo do p?r-do-sol. <br>  <br>  Eu também n?o tinha parado pra pensar nisso..........já que perguntou eu fiquei sabendo também!!!<br>  <br>  Muitas perguntas parecem tolas e bobas, mas no fundo n?o sabemos as respostas, por isso é bom perguntar mesmo......|`|56faab46de60e073e6348f4b3cf8da6daa	atmosfera!|`|MIeJ0eOvaa	talvez por causa da cor da Terra que reflete no céu,ou a atmosfera,mesmo..tbem queria saber o certo....|`|eVnrF41daa	N?o, n?o é porque Jesus é menino!<br>  Na verdade ele n?o é azul. Acontece que ele é totalmente escuro, mas a luz do Sol, que é uma luz branca, entra na atmosfera e defronta-se com as partículas suspensas fazendo com que elas ganhem tonalidade real. Como o azul é a cor que mais se aproxima do violeta, a mais escura portanto, ela quase n?o sofre varia??o na sua tonalidade real|`|jDCQkpmBaa	Pois a atmosfera reflete a cor do mar, o azul.

We see there's a -2x in the first equation and a -6x in the second.  These are simple multiples of each other.  So if we multiply both sides of the first equation by -3, we get 6x - 9y = 3.  Adding this to the second equation we get (6x - 6x) -9y - 10y = 3 + 3, and this simplifies to -19y = 6.  So y = -6/19, and we can plug this into either of the original equations and solve for x.<br>  <br>  Using the substitution method, we might solve the first equation for x and plug it into the second. This gives us:<br>  -6(1/2 + (3/2)y) - 10y = 3<br>  -3 - 9y - 10y = 3<br>  -19 = 6, just as before.<br>  This time we were kind of lucky in that the "1/2"s were canceled out by the -6.  But other times when we do substitution, we might get a lot of big fractions which can be hard to keep track of.  So sometimes addition is easier.  Other times, if you see something like "x + y = 1", substitution is probably easier.|`|KoEipToJaa	addition method, cuz -2x can be mult by 3 to get -6x and then just go from there|`|5d969882760163d7bb0e350261c4ef49aa	If you multiply the first equation by -3 you get: 6x-9y=3.

Britain is an island and the sea round it keeps it much warmer than countries at the same latitude in Europe. This means that berries, seeds and water are much more plentiful than in countries in the centre and north of Europe. Birds follow the food supply and you may notice that flocks of starlings and lapwings increase in size over the winter. This happens because the resident birds are joined by their continental cousins. In spring, the European birds return home and the resident numbers appear to dwindle. Flocks of redwings and fieldfares arrive before Christmas from their breeding grounds in Scandinavia.<br>  <br>  Birds also visit us from much further north, from inside the Arctic Circle. These are mainly water birds like ducks, geese and waders. They fly south when the waters of their breeding grounds freeze and follow the east coast of Scotland down. They fly up major watercourses, like the River Trent and settle in huge numbers in places that offer a good food supply. Many river estuaries have been used by birds resting and feeding for hundreds of years, but modern farming methods and land reclamation for industrial use has put some of these sites under threat. <br>  <br>  Birds migrate to improve their chances of survival. Insect-eating birds find a rich source of food in northern lands during summer and raise their chicks there. In winter the weather is too harsh to survive, so they come south again to feed in our warmer climate.<br>  .

d3c07e6a3ca7a93f8106d7a54406bbd2aa	A "two-way" mirror is just a mirror with little gaps in the shiny metallic<br>  coating.  Looking through a two-way mirror is like looking through a screen<br>  with holes much smaller than usual.  Light will pass through in both<br>  directions.  You can see through in either direction.  The shiny coating is<br>  visible from the front.<br>  <br>  When looking at the front, the reflected light is MUCH brighter than the<br>  little that comes through from the back.  As a result, you don't notice it.<br>  The back side is colored dark and dull.  Very little light gets reflected<br>  from the back.  Someone behind a two-way mirror can see through more easily.<br>  <br>  If you turn off ALL lights on the side in front of the mirror, make it pitch<br>  black, you will be able to see through from the front.  Of course, there has<br>  to be a light on behind the mirror.  Whenever a two-way mirror is used for<br>  spying, the room behind the mirror is kept dark.  This way, there is no<br>  light to be seep through to the front.  Also, the room in front of the<br>  mirror is usually kept bright.  This makes it easier for the "spies" to see<br>  what is happening.  It also makes it harder for the "victims" to notice any<br>  light getting through the mirror.<br>  <br>  I expect the first two-way mirror was just a cheaply made regular mirror:<br>  the metal was not applied thickly enough to cover the glass well.
