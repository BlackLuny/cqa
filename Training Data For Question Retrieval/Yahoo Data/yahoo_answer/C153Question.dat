20090219205240AAmsY3d	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Have you ever had someone randomly?	go off on you?      My mom was helping my brother with his english homework. She was having me look up for the definitions like metaphors, that kind of thing.       She got up and told me she was going to help him study for his test tomorrow.    He was wanting to do anything but study.       I said from the kitchen to let me help because I was really good with english and my mom starts angrily and sarcastically saying how she was such a failure in english and how stupid she was. I said no you aren't but I am the one with a 92% in my college english class and I am very good at this stuff. Then she went on about how she got straight A's in all her college classes but that didn't matter she she was just so dumb and didn't know how to do anything, like we actually thought that.       It just proceeded into this huge I am not even sure what. It was just a ton of yelling on her part and saying crap like let's just turn this into a huge fight. When all I was just trying to help.    It seemed like she was intentionally trying to cause drama and make it out to be that, I was in the wrong.       It was one of those moments where you are completely blindsided and you just have to stop from sheer confusion and wonder if you passed a welcome to hell sign population: you sign.      Ever have one of those? What happened in your situation?

20090219205608AA0oUrJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did you/Do you plan on stocking up on diapers?	I'm on the fence about stocking up on diapers.  A very good friend of mine had her son last year and registered for (what LOOKED like) a year supply of diapers.  She was given very few receipts, i'm just assuming people must of thought she wouldn't need it.  Baby boy comes, and we learn very quickly that he is allergic to disposables, and needs cloth diapers.  Target, and to my surprise, Walmart would not take an unopened pack back without a receipt.       Because of this, i'm hesitant to ask for diapers.  I figure i'd rather get the fun stuff as gifts, and buy them myself from cosco or sams anyways.  What are you feelings or experiences?        Thanks :)

20090219205827AApUkdV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast feeding vs. Bottles?	I have a plan for my baby, and I want to know other mother's opinions on it. Is this a good idea?      I am taking at least 8 weeks out of work for maternity leave. I want to breast feed, but I want other people to be able to feed him too. Pumping is not a very good option for me because once I go back to work I'll have NO time between that and the baby. So my plan is- breast feed for the first 1 1/2 months or so to get the colostrum into his system. Then slowly introduce formula and bottles to him as I get closer to going back to work. That way, he gets the healthy stuff, but once I go back to work, I'll have a more convenient way of feeding and others will be able to feed him while I'm gone.      Is this a good plan?
20090219205620AAP561B	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Have a question, Could you help me?	I'm really curious right now, not stressed, just curious. I had unprotected sex on Febuary 10. The past two days Ive been having light cramps and mood swings, kind of like PMS symptons, but different. I took a test tonight and it was negative, but upon further investigating, only a little after a week after a possible conception would be too soon for an acurate test anyway. Then I read that egg implantation occurs a week after conception and causes PMS-type symptons....so I'm wondering if I may be pregnant. Anyone know how much longer I should wait to take another test?? Also, I don't know when my last period was, so I have no way of knowing when its due.

20090219205959AAmExM3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Why don't kids care about their personal Hygiene?	My 11 year old boy could go weeks w/o showering if he could. We make him take showers 3x's a week. Before we applied this rule he would go days and we'd ask him when the last time he took a shower and he said he didn't know.           Also, his bed sheets are so dirty, I asked him to bring them down a couple weeks ago and he never did. He has been sleeping in the same sheets for months. I think it is gross. He says that he cant feel it dirty.

My baby's father lives in New York so I haven't seen him since I left New York. I screwed up and slept with a married man. His wife knows that him and I had sex. He told her it was a one time thing when in reality it went on for months. He won't tell anyone the truth about what happened between us and I'm fed up with it. I feel like I should still be talking with him to let him know how I'm doing and how the pregnancy is going but at the same time, he makes me so mad when I talk to him. I'm at the point where I want to tell his wife that he's been lying to her for 8 months. Should I continue to talk to him everyday like I have or should I only let him know how my doctors appointments go? Should I stop talking to him all together? I want him involved in my child's life but not if he's going to continue to lie about what happened between us. PLEASE HELP!

20090219214100AAdeIFv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would you handle this 13-year old babysitter?	we recently 'hired' a neighbor's daughter to babysit our sons.  she comes in when the boys have gotten home from school and then leaves as soon as i come home from work.  my hubby works from home and goes out for some meetings at times so he can't be 100% there for the boys everyday.   the babysitter was ok at first.  but now my hubby tells me that this girl has gotten a bit too comfortable.  he's caught her watching adult shows with my boys present a few times.  not the lewd ones.  but the ones like gossip girl, lipstick jungle, sex and the city, and the local trashy shows.  he's told her to stick to kiddie shows when the kids are around and she's complied.  but still he catches her watching her shows when he peeks in.     we've made it clear to her that sweets should be limited, too.  and yet she brings the kids candies and lollipops the minute they ask for it --without asking for my hubby's permission.  her reason is that 'they bully her into doing it'.   my hubby has also caught her sleeping on the couch while the boys played with the talcum powder on the floor.    oh, and she kisses my boys A LOT!  like i can actually smell my boys smelling of saliva all over their faces, necks and arms.  lol! but that's just my beef.   i understand that she's not really a professional babysitter.  we only give her a small allowance and she does get to eat anything she wants in the house.     i would like to 'fire' her but that would be marring the friendship we have with the neighbor.  and my boys really like her (go figure why!).   so what do we do?  i'm thinking of talking to her mom.  but where do i start?  i know she feels they're actually doing us a favor for helping us with the boys.  but this is crazy!     my hubby says he feels like he's taking care of 3 children now instead of getting any help.

We sit at the same table, I am at the end and he is at the side really really close to me. In the second class right before lunch, he is usually my lab partner and for our unit, we are doing something about light and mirrors so the lights are off and we have to crowd around a small flash light thing so our shoulders are usually touching. For the next class we have together, we don't sit beside each other, I would have to look over my shoulder to see him and we usually don't talk in this class.

20090219220000AARgc4h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do some parents act like this?	So I took my wife to the optomitrist the other day, and we had our 20 month old son with us.  I kept him with me in the waiting room while she had her exam.  I was sitting in a chair reading him a book and he was holding his toy truck.  He would giggle when I got to his favorite parts and was being very well behaved.  The woman sitting next to us had a son around my sons age maybe a few months older that was playing in the floor rolling around and stuff.  I kept reading to my son and even changed books a few times.  I am pretty affectionate so I will hug or kiss him on the head between pages and he will smile.      The other lady is starting to yell at her kid because he is screaming and rolling all over the place now and telling him, "why can't you be good like this other boy."  I try not to pay attention and just focus on my son but the kid is pretty loud and bumping people that get anywhere near him.  Now he is just yelling at the top of his lungs and my son is staring at the kid like he is dieing or something.  The woman tries to pick him up and he will go limp and kick at her and stuff so she gives up and lets the kid run wild.      She then comes over to me, I was back to reading the book again and trying to act like I was not paying attention to her sons behavior, and she asks me, "how do you get your son to behave so well."  So I tell her, "If he acts up, I beat his ***."  If he crys I take him to the bathroom till he quits and then we go back to what we were doing.  I am the adult and he knows that I will always win and that what I say goes.        She then begins to question my parenting skills telling me how horrible it is to ever hit your child and tells me I am a bad parent and that my son should be taken away from me.  Then she grabs her kid by the ankle and drags him across the room telling him not to come near me and that I am a bad man,  She had to drag him because he would not let her pick him up.  I mean you would never even know I was a spanker from looking at my son so it is not like he is covered in bruises and where does she get off questioning my parenting skills?  I never questioned hers and still don't.  If she wants to let her kid act like that it is her buisness and I think she should show me the same respect.  She asked me what I do and I told her.        It's not like I spanked my son in the store, I didn't have to.  He is good on his own because he knows that he should be now.  Why would someone act like that?

My 18 month old son has been around kids in the past a few times when he was younger and acted fine but i'm just a lil concerned cause lately i've brought him around my friends daughter who is almost 10 months old and the 1st time he was around her he was rubbing her back and tried to even kiss and hug her but she kind of started crying cause he took her toy and she crawled up to him really fast and i think he got scared and he ran to me and started screaming and acted a lil scared of her after that. Well past couple of times i've brought him around her she smiles and crawls after him but he just totally freaks out and starts screaming and crying and runs up to me for me to pick him up like he's terrified of her. When he sees her coming towards him he freaks out and was even hyperventilating and crying, it's wierd. He watches her when she's doing her own thing like he's interested and wants to play with her but as soon as she starts coming towards him and laughing he just freaks out. Is this normal?
20090219214837AAWkhBe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My kid came home from school one day and announced?	he wasn't going to eat hot dogs again!  A teacher told all of the kids that hot dogs were made with a lot of digusting things.  This turned my kid, as well as other kids off.  Now he tells me that the only ho dog he will eat is the expensive brand, Hebrew national Franks!  These are more than twice the price!  I feel like telling this teacher to keep her mouth shut from now on, especially in these tough economic times where every cent counts!  What do you think I should do?  Should I speak my mind to this teacher?  what should i tell my kid?   By the way, as it turns out, I did a little research and the cheaper hot dogs are in fact made out of some pretty unappetizing stuff.  Now what do i say and do?  Thanks for the help.

What would you say if you lived in a country town area and your 16 year old daughter wanted to catch the train with a few friends to Sydney.    They would call to tell you everything they were doing before they did it eg. Call to say we are about to get on the bus and go shopping, call to say we are back at the hotel etc.   They were going to save up during the year and go just after their year 10 graduation.      I just need to know what to expect from my Mum.   I live in Australia by the way..

(my daughter is an infant so i cant ask what happened). Also he told us he hears her screaming at the kids all say long and she leaves in the moring and gets back home before we get home with the kids, she always tell me they stayed home. When i come home everyone is all great and happy and it SEEMS lie she does a great job. I am pissed, as i am a vry overprotective mother, i am trusting my baby to someone, but i am not sure how to handle the situation. WHAT SHOULD I DO????

20090219215509AAGHRJ0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Experience with a not so nice doctor?	The OB I have seen since I was 13, who worked with me through my fertility issues and helped me get pregnant, does not deliver in my area. I admit I drive almost an hour to see her, but trust me it is worth it, her and her entire staff are amazing. I do realize an hour is to far away if i am in labor, so I found a doctor in my area to deliver and saw her for the first time today. Keep in mind she is one a a very few in my area, and I am on an HMO ( uck I know) so that limits my choices even farther. The problem is, I truly do not agree with some of the things she said during my appointment. She told me not to gain any weight during my pregnancy, I am slightly over weight, but my doctor told me no woman should strive for no weight gain, that it is pretty unrealistic and can basically upset me when I fail at it. She wants me to be very active during my entire pregnancy, my doctor advised lots of rest because I am slightly higher risk because of my PCOS. She also seemed to have HUGE problem with us being a one income family, and my being a student. I WOULD NOT have gotten pregnant if we could not afford it, my husband makes incredible money and we both prefer I stay home until I graduate. I always assumed it was our business if I worked or not, and not a doctors place to say something to me unless I pointed out I could not afford this. Also, she wants me to work a full time job, but thinks school is to much time away from the baby ( I attend 2 days a week 4 hours each day). Is it wrong for me to allow her to deliver my baby and do the prenatal care ( she does have excellent recomendations and is very well trained) but then to return to my regular OB? Also, am I being to sensitive? I know pregnant women can be a little cranky and moody, and I am worried I am getting upset over nothing? Does anyone else have any not so nice doctor experiences?

20090219214729AAGpo0R	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to handle an 11 year old who steals?	I have read through a ton of answers on here and still can't find my answer.   My little sister is 11, and I am 24.    About 2 weeks ago she said she had $35 in her wallet. Three 5's and a 20. She counted it at night and left her wallet on the kitchen counter, then first thing in the morning she says $20 is missing.   The only people with access to it are me and mom, and we know neither of us took it. She kept blaming us for her money missing, but refused to try looking for it, saying she knew it was in her wallet and there is no way she could have placed it somewhere else. Then after she went to her dad's for the weekend she came home with new clothes. She said her dad bought them for her. Then about 2 days later she slipped up and said she had to pay for half of what the clothes cost.   Getting to the question at hand.   We are tight for money right now, yesterday, we recycled our cans and bottles and got $50. The money was left sitting on top of the computer desk downstairs. After school I went and laid down in my room for about half an hour. When I came upstairs she was looking in her room for a gift card that she got for her birthday around the same time as she got her other money that she said was missing. She was looking for the gift card so she could go buy a webkinz at Zellers or the Bay. When she moved the bed mattress she found a clean crisp $20 bill, folded in the exact manner as the money that was left on the computer desk downstairs. This was just minutes after having gone downstairs to grab the blankets out of the dryer.   She comes out of her room acting very excited that she found the $20 that she lost 2 weeks ago. In that moment I did not know that I had any money missing because I had not checked, I just came straight upstairs, and I assumed that yes it was possible this was her missing $20. It was not until after she left that I discovered $20 missing. She used that money to buy her webkinz instead of using the gift card that she still never found.   I am going to start marking our bills from now on, but what should I do to discipline her. BTW. she has not been confronted yet.   When she gets grounded, I want say, no computer cuz your grounded, hopefully she will ask why she is grounded, and I will say, you tell me why you are grounded. We have not said a thing about money missing, we are hoping she confesses, we are not going to tell her what is missing just tell her she is grounded.   What would you do, and do you think it is a good idea to try getting her to confess. Every time we confront her with $20 is missing, she screams at us that everyone always blames her, and I didn't do it, and so very logical however knowingly not true reasons as to where her money came from.

I've been careless once more knowing that the one that I'm having an affair with is married with a kid. Call me *****, sinner, evil, whatever you wanna call me, I'll accept it. 7 mons ago I've had an abortion--that caused me to become polycystic-- and perhaps it didn't had too much impact in my life that's why I still become careless and I actually become worst knowing that I'm having an affair with a married man this time. Now, I'm pregnant again and I'll be having an abortion anytime soon. He didn't know it because I know he'll not gonna take me seriously anyway. He's married and I don't wanna ruin his family 'cause of this. But that's not only my purpose of doing this, I'm 18 years old and I already have a two-year old kid that's supported by my parents. And my parents are very supportive to me as well--they're even determined to help me finish my studies and I'm going to enter college this next school year. If I continue this pregnancy everything will be ruined--my parents' dream for me, my partner's family, and my whole self. I don't want that to happen... now tell me that I may be a sinner but what i'll be doing soon it what I should do!

I just took on a 9 month old on Monday. He's turned out to be a lot more to handle then I can deal with. Honestly - there is something "off" about him. Physically for sure - he doesn't sit up on his own and they're taking him to a specialist next week. He's also getting glasses this weekend. (Which isn't a big deal) But there is just something... off. He constantly needs attention. He cannot hold his bottle himself and gets frustrated when I lay him on the floor to play because he can't play independently. I don't want to be the person that leaves a child in an exersaucer all day because I "don't know what else to do" and I don't want to ignore the other kids because I have to devote all of my time to this one child.      So how can I politely and professionally explain to his mom that our arrangement just isn't going to work out. How would YOU want to be told - as a mom?

Thank you!

20090219221340AAbiPaM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How many people have had brown/pink spotting during early pregnancy & went on to have a healthy baby?	I'm 5 weeks and 4 days pregnant.  (I'm actually "earlier" in my pregnancy since I don't ovulate until late, but my OB/GYN calculates everyone the same based on an average 28 day cycle.)      Anyhow, Tuesday night, I went to the ER because I had a bit of red/brown blood mix and cramping.  I had some tests and an ultrasound.  It was too early to pick anything up on the ultrasound, but my cervix was closed and my HCG levels were at 328, which was good.  During my wait, I had been given an IV with fluids and then was told to take it easy and get my levels retested - which is happening tomorrow.  I'm still having brown spotting.  I know this is "old blood" but it's still driving me nuts.      Although I'm being tested tomorrow morning, I'm still very nervous.  I want this baby very much.  My last pregnancy ended in miscarriage and started out with brown spotting.  I have two healthy children and I never had spotting or bleeding while pregnant with them.      Has anyone had spotting early in their pregnancy (especially after a miscarriage) and where the pregnancy resulted in a healthy baby?

She is exclusively breastfed so for the past 6 weeks she has been with me 24/7 and not having her sleeping next to me makes me feel uneasy.

20090219221540AAaGv7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long does it take for a rash to fade?	My son is 5 weeks old, and I think he was allergic to either his Johnson's baby wash, or our laundry detergent. I've only been washing him with warm water, and rewashed all of his clothes in Dreft on Monday. It's looking much, much better, but how long do you think until it's fully gone? It seems to be lingering in places that get hot and sticky (neck, under his chin, around his ear where he lays his head). I've been putting some Aquaphor on after baths to try to protect the skin. Do you think that's helpful or harmful? Also, what kind of baby wash/lotion have you guys used for your sensitive skin babies?? Thanks :)
20090219221723AAT7oEz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should there be protection rights for the unborn that will be born?	I don’t really want this to be a question addressing pro-life and pro- choice viewpoints, rather a question about a child that is in the mother’s womb and will be born.  Okay, we currently don’t have any laws protecting the unborn.  I know some people on her believe that abortion is fine.  I don’t, but I am asking a more specified question here.  For a child that is going to be born (the child is not going to be aborted), shouldn’t’ there be a law that protects that child from being abused by the mother from alcohol and drugs?  I mean there are tons of children born each year that have deformities and lack of intelligence because of their mother’s abuse while they were in the womb.  Don’t you think that these unborn people that are destined to be born, because the mother plans on bringing them in the world, have a right to have intelligence and be healthy?   I am interested to see how pro-choice people will answer this.  I am sure that a lot of the tax dollars are going for the care of these deformed and mentally deficient kids that are born with problems that the mother caused.

My 6 month old Son is having sleep issues... he has always been a fighter to get to take a nap or sleep at night... well its only getting worse.. he refuses to take naps during the day or sleeping at night he takes quick 10 minute power naps during the day I have been sticking  to a routine...  I baught the fancy dr wess. book i have been trying his method,, the cry out method.. he screamed for 2- 3 hrs.. each time i tryed ...yeah ,,. not working.. i can sit there for a hour trying to soothe him or rocking him in the chair all he does it gets more and more upset.. I try and lay him down before he gets overtired .. when i see the first signs he is tired..but he never goes down without a good scream...  he might get a 40 minute nap during day if we are lucky..he even gets the idea i am trying to get him to sleep he freaks out .. i dont understand how a 6 month old can know this...I have tryed to put him in our bed when i just cant stand up.. he wont sleep there either ..  i put him to bed at 7pm he usually screams and fusses until atleast 10pm.. no matter what i do.. then he might sleep until 3am then he is awake i usually think he is just hungry and try and nurse him .. most of the time he isnt hungry,,, just has decided he doesent want to sleep and will put up quite the fuss if we try and put him back to sleep.. so from 3 am i am up until atleast 5am then he sleeps until 7... and awake he is again..  he doesent get enought sleep thats for sure.. he is a happy baby until its time to nap then it all goes down hill... i am at my wits end i only get maybe 3 hrs of sleep at night i cant nap during the day i feel like i am going to fall over.. not even my mom can get him to nap she is as puzzled as me... any ideas??
20090219223757AA9Q0k6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Octuplet Fathers Rights?	am confused about the father situation of the Octuplets. Is this person just a friend that Nadya Suleman knows or is he more like a boyfriend? Some stories makes it sound like she has trouble conceiving naturally, but then there have been some sources where she claims to be celibate or will be celibate for a long time. Could she have had babies naturally, and if so why did she choose not do this. Was it because she was not married? Im sorry, but I didn't think people did invitro unless they had trouble naturally, or the doctors would not allow them to do that. I know this is true for some adoption agencies; that if you are capable of making babies you can not adopt, or only certain people can have international adoption.      I think there have been some stories about how she did not want the father to have connections to these children. Is this true? Ok, even if he is not able to have any physical custody of these children or visitation rights then can Nadya Suleman make him pay child support for 8 of the children. If she does not get enough help from welfare, and other places, I would not be surprised if she does. Does she get child support for the other children?      Ok, I am not necessarily saying you have to be married to have children, but what kind of psychological disorder can somebody be diagnosed with to want to take care of 14 children with out the help of the father of the children? It sounds like this lady has control issues and would be afraid if anybody took away her children. Doesn't she know about DHR and what they might do to her.

To cut an extremely long and complicated story short:      I like this guy, my best friend's brother, and when I told my friend she told him. He said "aw, that's cute. tell her I'll think about it" which I was pretty upset about because I figure if he liked me he would have just said "yes". But I guess he just doesn't know me well enough?      I found out later that he liked someone else, but when he told her she said they should just be friends.       Anyway, now I have his msn... I talk to him sometimes but it's always like "hi" "how are you" "how was your day" boring stuff.      I really want to get to know him but I can never think of anything to say, and I always feel like he's freaked out by me because he knows I like him...       What can I do? Should I just back off?      =(

20090219164951AAqUkdL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I caught someone cutting, sorta....?	Well, today in my 10th grade Geometry math class before the bell had rang we were talking and laughing together, around four of us. Jeremy (name changed) was saying how he got these cuts on his arms: He said in English his metal pen thing fell off and Warren cut him a couple times with it.      Then we got to a point in the conversation when I said thinking he'd say "no I wouldn't do that I'm not that stupid", "well then, cut yourself." I think he mentioned that he said it didn't hurt or anything when he did it. Then he grabbed the metal thing and cut himself....two or three times. I was shocked. I don't know what to say or do.      I really want to contact his parents somehow, without him knowing. I am in absolute shock that he would do this. I remember in the past he was suicidal. Is there anyway I can find his email without him or any of my friends knowing? I don't think phoning would work, because I am not sure if he is able to check messages or not, and I am not that confident with talking and I tend to make it lighter than it is.       I really, really, really do think he may need some help. I just don't know how to bring it to his parents by getting their email to do so. We have a school directory which gives all of the phone numbers of everyone (400 students in our school Kinder-12)       What do I do?    How do I get the email of his parents?   Or how do I find a way to contact his parents without him knowing?

Ok so I am a girl, Obviously as you can see from my profile, and I was in the locker room changing out of my bra, the really mean girls at my skool took my clothes and threw them into the gym room so I went out to get them and the guys took them and ran down the hall and I had a towel so i wrapped it around me and ran down the hall to catch them and They stopped and turned around and ripped off my towel and picked me up, (squishing my boobs and vachina) and Took pics in the guys locker room and ALL THE GUYS WERE THERE! IT WAS SO EMBARRASING! Then the tyed me and put me up in the Cafetiria!

20090219165042AAIkPAl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone here LABORED alone?	I'm considering this, not for lack of volunteers, but for concentration. I'm a person who loves solitude anyway, not a real social butterfly. During my first labor/delivery, my dear and loving husband was with me the whole time (18 hours). It seemed like he was more of a distraction to me than a support (which he was working so hard at). I will however want him there for the delivery and the cord-cutting business. From the pushing stage on ....      If you have considered laboring alone (or actually done it), what kind of personality do you have and how did you like your experience?

20090219170127AAERKLz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I need advice from some outside people, please!?	Okay, I'm going to try giving you the short version...   I had a glorified one-night stand back in September with a guy who was in town for work for 2 weeks.  We got to know each other a little, went out to dinner, ended up sleeping together, and then he left a few days later.  I found out a few weeks later that I was pregnant.   I told him after I found out and got an unhappy reaction.  It took him about a month to accept it and about another month or two to finally get excited about it.     I live in North Carolina, he lives in Ohio.  He is up for promotion which would be an extreme pay increase and a move to Minnesota.  I originally told him I would move to Ohio so we could be together and try to start a family and have a normal relationship.  The bitchier I get, the more he annoys me, and the more I decided I wanted to stay in North Carolina with my family.  My problem is that I'm not sure whether I genuinely don't want a relationship with him or if it's just the hormones talking.  Earlier on in the pregnancy, I felt a connection with him that we were hoping to build upon.  Now...he kind of just aggravates me.  I don't want to sacrifice my child's chance at having her father be a part of her life just because my stupid hormones.  What can I do?  Any suggestions from anyone?

20081102183709AAjH3SD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Giving breastfed baby formula makes him extremely sleepy?	My wife has breastfed our son (10 months) almost exclusively.  He drank expressed milk only during the day for a few months while she worked, and he has had formula a handful of times when we ran out of expressed milk and my wife was gone.  He never really had any problem with formula because he was already used to the bottle.  The one thing that happened every time was that the first time he drinks formula he gets extremely sleepy.  This last time we gave him formula he fell asleep sitting up, and when I took him and put him on the floor in our room he stayed asleep for almost 3.5 hours until I finally woke him up.  This was in the middle of the day.  Normally he won't go to sleep unless he is breastfeeding, or if someone rocks him to sleep or holding him.  Also, he normally doesn't sleep for more than 30-40 minutes during the day and he still doesn't sleep more than 5 or 6 hours straight at night either.  It is way out of character for him.      Has anyone else had this experience?  Is this a bad sign?  What would cause this?

20090219165231AASwoEt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	High blood pressure and liver enzymes in pregnancy.?	Two weeks ago I went to the OB for severe abdominal pain.  The doctors said it was probably my Gall Bladder and did some blood work. They tested my liver enzymes which were high, however they ended up sending me home anyway on a low fat diet for the gall bladder.      3 days ago I wasn't feeling well and I called my doctor who had me come in.  My blood pressure was high 145/90 and I had a significant amount of swelling.  They were concerned about preeclampsia, but I don't have any protiens in my urine.  I went back to the doctor today, after having another attack of severe abdominal pain even though I've been following the low fat diet. My blood pressure was still high, so he ordered some blood work.  My liver enzymes were elevated again.  My doctor still doesn't think I have preeclampsa, and isn't sure why my enzymes are high. (or at least isn't telling me why he thinks my enzymes are high.)      are there any other conditions that cause elevated blood pressure and liver enzymes during pregnancy without having preeclampsia?

20090219170136AAJkie6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	I'm about to begin a child support case with my son's father. Should I talk to him or not?	Ok, so I'll try to keep this short.  My son just turned 1 on February 6.  The sperm donor has never met him or has made any attempt to do so.  During my whole pregnancy, I received threats that he would attempt to take him away from me.  Well, a year has come and gone and nothing.  I last spoke to him in July of 2007, when I was 10 weeks pregnant.  Then today I get a message through myspace from him.  I'm scared to respond back because I don't want him to use anything against me, if it's possible.  The other part of me wants to reply and tell him what my problem with him is.  So I guess my question is, do I shut my mouth until the child support hearing in March or do I respond back?  Thanks.

20090219191820AAhD6oF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	It's Gross...but does anyone know what's wrong with me?	I was on Seasonique for 3 weeks and just stopped taking it about 4-5 days ago.   I started it 2 weeks after my period.   I've had pain in my lower back and along my spine for about 2 weeks, breast tenderness for about 2 weeks, slight cramping for a couple days, headaches and frequent urination.   I thought I was pregnant...I know it was pretty much impossible...but I tested anyway to make sure.   Three negative tests.   I started having a clearish discharge for the past 2 days and last night it started having a pinkish tint.   I just figured it was my period.   This morning it was the same way with a bright pinkness and a little bright red.   I thought it was my period and put a tampon in.   I always have extremely painful periods, but today it was worse.   I would be in so much pain I felt like I was going to pass out and then it would just go away.   I changed my tampon and there was a drop of blood on the top.   I put another one in thinking that it was just my period about to start.   A couple hours later I went to change it and something fell on my hand.   It was about 6 inches high and 4 inches wide.   It had sort of an oblong shape.   It was fleshy-color, veins and everything.   The outer edges were kind of ridges and were a dark brownish/red color.   I went to the ER because I don't think this is normal.   They simply told me that I had no infections, I wasn't pregnant [they did a blood test] and that they weren't there to diagnose.   They said it could be ovarian cysts or a cyst on my uterus...but they don't know.   Ugh.   They told me I needed to find a Gyno up here and go.   That's what I'm planning on doing...but I was just freaking out a little bit.   My fiance and I have decided to try to conceive, so this is worrying me.   I'm just worried that something might be wrong with me and I'm afraid I may be unable to have children.   I know it's too much information, but I just wanted some advice from someone.

20090203110928AADBc4S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I have this little guy early?	I'm 35 weeks today according to my LMP, but there is a chance that could be wrong due to a number of reasons.  If it is wrong than I would be farther, but there isn't really a way to find out now.      The baby was never really hugh up, I hardly ever feel short of breath and I always had a normal appetite (no squished stomach).  Also I have had to pee several times a day and night for a couple weeks now.  Does this mean he has dropped?  It's very hard to tell because he has been head down and low all along.      Also, when I get up to walk after sitting for a little bit it hurts in my pelvis area.  It also hurts to roll over in bed and get up in the morning.  Is this because of the baby's head?        With the baby so low, the pressure and pain in my pelvis, and an increase in braxton hicks is it possible I will have him early?  Should I ask the doctor to check my cervix this friday at my appointment?
20090219205717AAUQsIP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you plan on stocking up on diapers?	I'm on the fence about stocking up on diapers. A very good friend of mine had her son last year and registered for (what LOOKED like) a year supply of diapers. She was given very few receipts, i'm just assuming people must of thought she wouldn't need it. Baby boy comes, and we learn very quickly that he is allergic to disposables, and needs cloth diapers. Target, and to my surprise, Walmart would not take an unopened pack back without a receipt.       Because of this, i'm hesitant to ask for diapers. I figure i'd rather get the fun stuff as gifts, and buy them myself from cosco or sams anyways. What are you feelings or experiences?       Thanks :)

20090219204008AAOuJIu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, Has your child ever been?	put on ablify? What was thier diagnose? What is a normal dosage of this med and how did it work for your child? Did your child take other meds with this?       I am asking due to my son called today , for those of you that don't know my story is that my son is in a instution, he told me that they are starting abilfy with him, and he is on 40 mg of ritailin, and he is taking clondine.    Now , I do know that abilify is for bi polar, but as far as I am aware that hasn't been made a diganose as of yet, his diagnose that are noted at this time is ADHD, ODD, Conduct Disorder, possiable mood disorder.       Now a concern of mine is that he does have bi polar, but as I am reading a book on bi polar, I am concern of the ritalin and is this normal because they say that the sitlumate can cause more aggression and anger, which is something that he has a lot of problems with . If he does have both ADHD and Bi polar, what are the normal treatment plans for this, or do they commonly find that they have bi polar and not so much the adhd?    I undserstand this is alot of questions, but as he is in a state faculity, I don't get to talk to the doctor myself but only the group leader/counsler, i want to know what questions would be good to ask that other parents that have experienced this. Sorry of all the misspeelngs I am just confused and some what excited to be able to explain some of my sons wild behavior, not as in excited as you think but glad to know that thier may be some reasons and that there is help maybe for him.       Also is major depression, also bi polar as well. And should a doctor not looked at my mental health issues to make this diagnose much sooner, as I am reading if I am understanding that major depression is a form of bi polar, which is my diagnoses.?      Thanks for any help any one can give me ...

Ok so i went for a blood test well it came back negitive,BUT i still think im pregnant...theres nothing else to explain the way i feel      Anyway,my question is this:      when i called my doctor i tld them i want to do a quanitative test (the one that counts exactly what you HCG level is)(he just order a quantitative one witch says yes or no).He said he will add on that test.      So he ment he would send to the lab to run another test on the same blood.      Does that make sence has anybody ever heard of that?or is he just trying to satifiy my and tell me they can do that?      Does the lab keep your blood for a certain amount of days after they perform the intial test?is that why he can add on this second test?

My husband's neice lives with us and she is 14. We have her because her mother abandoned her and her 5 brothers and sister.

My problem is; She constantly always asks to go somewhere and it annoys me. She is grounded due to some mistakes she has done. twice already. She is always asking to go to her other aunt's house. I mean, I dont mind her going, but not all the time. I am trying to teach her right from wrong because I have been through all this. I use to act like her friend, but thats when she was getting in trouble, so i knew i had to set rules. So now I act more like her mother, but seems like she does not like them.       What do i do? Dont tell me to throw her out, i would not do that. We were all like this before and our parents were there for us. I wanna teach her that things cant always go her way. please help.       If you have rude and nonsense answers just to gain 2 points you can just keep your answers to yourself. I want mature answers to help me.
20090219203635AAltOcz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does anyone celebrate the Easter Bunny and Easter separately?	This Easter will be the first my toddler is able to understand and most likely to remember, and I do definitely want to celebrate the Easter Bunny and all of the marketing-Easter-Spring hype, but I don't know if I want to celebrate it and our religious Easter together.

People always ask me & my husband when we are going to have our next baby(our dd is 18 months now) & more often then not they are in utter shock & dismay when we say that we only plan on having the one we already have!       Peoples biggest thing seems to be       "its not fair to your child-they'll be lonely (& shes not she has lots of other baby friends LOL) , blah blah or that if you have 2 they can play with each other & you have more time to do other stuff b/c they'll be occupied with one another"       Okay both are valid points BUT why do people think these are good enough reasons to bring another human life into the world?  & then have the gaul to think im nuts & selfish for not having more.       Also do you think it's a little bit of "misery likes company" going on. Not saying parents are miserable having more then one kid but Im sure financially it's harder & finding a babysitter etc etc is harder so do you think maybe moms of multiple children are a little jealous of the freedom that comes with being a mom to one?

My mom has to do his hair, pick out his clothes, make his food, pick up after him, etc. He will NOT do his homework, and my mom has to yell at him to get him to do it. In the morning, he refuses to go to school, especially because he didn't do all his homework and isn't prepared. By refuses I mean won't go to the bus, won't go to the car when my mom has to drive us, refuses to get outta bed, starts swearing at my mom, hitting me, etc. He's too big for this, and I mean big! He's 5'8 and 167 lbs! He plays video games all day, and treats my mom like dirt. When she tries to punish him, he gets in these huge anger rages and hounds my mom so she can't punish him. She works at home, and he can't keep hounding her like this because she has to make some money. It makes my mom sad to have to yell at him constantly, and doesn't want to ruin their relationship...please help!         Sorry this is so long.

20090203111401AAS6ZGH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of these names?	I am not pregnant yet, but I am going to start trying in a couple of months time. I want one more baby - baby number five! And I want the baby to be close in age to my youngest.       I have four kids already:    Lily Claire (age 6)   April Vivienne (age 6)   Tobias Maximus (age 3)   Isla Sienna (age 7 weeks)      For girls I like:    Madelyn Grace   Marcia Addison   Saffron Amelia    Addison Talia       Boys:    Jake Aidan   Reuben Jacob    Jesse Luke    Liam Felix       I realised that all my kids' names have both an 'L' and an 'i' in them (apart from Tobias which just has an 'i').    I thought it would be sweet to continue this. Lily, April, Tobias and Isla are all very different names but they sort of link together well due to the repeating letters throughout.       I like the idea of Liam for a boy. But I can't think of any for girls. And more for boys?   My friend suggested Isobella but it's a bit too similar to Isla.

Have you ever had a younger sibling tell your parent that you did something and the parent believe the younger sibling and start yelliing at you and the younger sibling was just absolutely enjoying? Just eating it up.       My brother does that all the time.    And I'll be like "he's doing it again, he's lying and starting stuff and you are believing him" and you just want to call time out and set things straight.          The lastest thing he keeps telling her is that I have child porn on my laptop.    This all started when I showed him a power point I made to convince my mom that I should be able to work the overnight shift at walmart and be able to take the car.    I showed him the power point and then wouldn't look at what he had to show me on his computer and he said "i'll tell mom you have child porn on your computer if you don't watch". I kept walking up the stairs and he yelled " mom, ****** has child porn on her laptop.    She doesn't believe this one but it's annoying because he keeps repeating it out in public and such.

20090203112300AAVUNZa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Charting Question... does it really matter?	So, I can seem to find this information anywhere. I realize that ideally you should take your temp at the same time each day under approximately the same sleeping conditions... I get it. But, what if you can't? My problem is that sometimes on the weekends my work schedule changes and I don't go to bed until MUCH later and then wake up MUCH later.       Should I still be waking at the same time, even if I have only had a few hours of sleep (as compared to like 7-8 every other time I've temped)? Or, do I just need to focus on how long I've been asleep? I guess my question is... does the actual time of day matter most, or does the number of consecutive hours of sleep count the most?       Thanks ladies!
20090203110921AANH2rd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should we have another baby?	First of all, i know it's kind of silly to be asking complete strangers on Y!A what is best for my family, but I just thought I'd get an unbiased opinion on our situation, and I am curious as to what others think.  Right now, my husband and I have 2 beautiful boys (7 years, and 10 months). We have been considering having another baby when our youngest is potty trained. We live in a 2 bedroom mobile home (a nice one, in my opinion) on our own land. I am a stay at home mom, my husband works full time. We were planning on buying a house once our youngest was in school and i could go back to work, but now we really want to have another baby. Since our house is small, everyone says we shouldn't. We have thought about adding a room on (kind of redneck, I know, but it would at least give us some extra space). Everyone also says that we have plenty of time to have more kids, but I want to go ahead and have another one, so that when he or she is in school, I can go back to work, buy a house, and our family would be complete (compared to waiting, going back to work, then quitting again to stay home with a new baby). My husband makes enough to pay the bills. We don't have a lot of extra money, but we are fine with that. We love our kids, and we both want a big family. Do you think it would be irresponsible for us to have another baby since our house is so small, and we don't have tons of money? What do you think?
20090219202829AAtHyM1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does it disgust you to see people who can't afford to have kids have kids?	I have this friend who is 26 and i'll be totally honest she's a complete and utter failure. She has 4 kids  (3 different dads) and she is now pregnant with her fifth. Her mom kicked her out at age 18 because she refused to go to school or work she's been hoping from home to home job to job for years during all this time she had  2 baby boys and twin girls.when her first was born she was homeless and we let her and the baby live with us for a year we didn't make her pay for anything but during that time she worked for only 3 months so we eventually kicked her out she again hopped from home to home then she left her kid with her mom and took off for 3 weeks her mom contacted chilf services and the kid was allowed to stay with her during this time she got pregnant again and after teh baby was born the grandmother took it and kicked her to the curb then she got preggers with twin girls same thing happened now shes pregnant again. I love her mother to death and her kids are so precious i love watching them and spending time with them but at the same time i can't stand my friend i think she's filthy and disgusting for doing this to her kids and i cannot stand any woman who pops out kids that they cant care for.

Another adoptive mom from China that I know recently told me that she has been writing yearly letters to her daughter's mama since they adopted their daughter almost 10 years ago, even going so far as to have them translated into Mandarin. She felt it was important and that if there was even a minute chance that they will find her mama one day, this amom wanted to be able to share these letters with her. She also wanted to share them with her daughter and let her now that they embraced her other family and that they thought of them often.      I thought this was a wonderful idea and I'm considering doing it myself. I then discovered that several amoms have been doing this, including those who adopted from foster care.

ONLY when she sleeps. She has been off the bottle since she was 12 months, but we just can't seem to kick this habit. I'm a dental assistant so I know that prolonged use of a pacifier isn't a good idea. I'm just looking for an answer from other mom's who have had to do the same. We were successful for 1 night, but the next day I caved after an hour of crying "BINKYYYYY!!!!! BINKYYYYYY!!! MOMMYYYYY!!!!!"   Please help me! Thank you!

People were calling him idiotic and stupid and telling him he's too immature to be dad because his girlfriend hasn't taken a test yet because they're "in denial".      Who are any of you to judge this guy based upon the five sentences you read on Yahoo Answers?! Maybe his girlfriend was planning on taking a test this weekend and he just wanted some advice before then? Maybe he wasn't? Either way, you can tell him you think they need to take a test without being so hostile.       People are so god damn rude!

The past two days Ive been having light cramps and mood swings, kind of like PMS symptons, but different. I took a test tonight and it was negative, but upon further investigating, only a little after a week after a possible conception would be too soon for an acurate test anyway. Then I read that egg implantation occurs a week after conception and causes PMS-type symptons....so I'm wondering if I may be pregnant. Anyone know how much longer I should wait to take another test??

20090219201320AA7WTCY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	5 days late, positive and negative tests, spotting?	I'm 5 days late with my period and last week (before my period), I took a digital pregnancy test one afternoon and it came out positive.  A few hours later, I took a couple more tests and they came out negative.  Then I took a couple more tests with morning urine a few days later and they came out positive.  I had 2 positives 2 mornings in a row.      I never got my period, but today I had a bit of spotting (very light at least so far), but I was worried to see the blood so I came home after work and took another test and it says negative.  But I'm afraid it could be early on and my urine may have been too diluted to pick up the HCG???  No cramping or anything like that.      Planning on trying the test again in the morning, but do you think I'm still pregnant or not?

20090203105816AAO2hQ6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Do you think my daughter is justified in being totally píssed at me?	I had told her I would take her to get her ears pierced before school this morning as an early birthday present, and she talked me into getting my long-closed ears re-pierced with her.      To cut a long story short, I went first and it hurt like hell, it brought tears to my eyes. Despite her protests, I told her it hurt me like crazy and I wasn't prepared to let her go through that. She was kind of like "yeah, well, of course its gonna hurt but it won't hurt tomorrow and the earrings will still be in".      I pretty much dragged her out the shop and took her to school.      Now, over 10 hours later, she is still mad at me. She wants her Dad to take her to get them done tomorrow because she says he knows she isn't the wimp that I'm trying to turn her into.

20090203105908AAUBrZG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 4 year old girl wishes grandma was dead?	My 4 year old daughter is a real joy most of the time but she can be very mean and hot-headed sometimes. Her temper flares up over the smallest things and she argues with me almost every day about something. Timeouts don't work and spanking doesn't work either. My husband and I almost expect a crying fit every other day, usually caused by whenever she does not get her way. Usually after 5 or 10 minutes, she is fine and acts as if nothing had happened. The next time it's the same cycle all over again. When she is upset, she has started to say very negative things about the family members who are near her at the time. She often wishes that she be only with another person who is not there. So for example, if she has a fit with my husband nearby, she will say that she doesn't want him as part of our family any more and she only wants to live with me. If I am the one nearby during her fit, she will say exactly the opposity thing. I have been hoping that she will grow out of this behavior and it's "just a phase" but what she said recently really scares me. My mother moved in with us couple of months ago and one day, out of the blue (not during any temper tantrum or fit) my girl says that she wished grandma would die. And she said it so matter of fact, that it scared me to death. I did not know what to say. When I asked her why, she did not explain. She could have said that she wishes grandma would leave or move out, but she didn't. She wished that she would die. My mom loves her as much as I do and was really upset about this.  My husband says it's time to take her to child psychologist and get her evaluated for potential behavior disorders. One of my husband's relatives suffers from depression and he is concerned that our daughter may be prone to something similar. But is a 4 year old child old enough to be evaluated for somthing like this? What if she is labeled as special needs based on something that she may grow out of? I'm not sure what to do.

Now I woke up early today because I felt nauseated and couldn't sleep, then I had diarrhea.  As the day has progressed, I have light flu-like symptoms now.  Like achy all over, and feel drained, with an upset stomach.  Not bad enough to go home from work, but I don't feel like myself.      Also my bbt was really high this morning, 98.9, at this stage in my cycle, I'm usually around 98.4-98.5.      Isn't it too early to be having pregnancy symptoms if I was pregnant, I'm only 7dpo?

20090219221932AAyzcOj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What's it like being a parent?	How hard is it being a parent? Do you feel like your life is run by your child\children?      My husband and I are discussing have a baby (not necissarily soon, but at some point). I work fairly long days but that is mostly by choice... my husband works weird hours as a cop, some days its late at night, sometimes early, etc. like his shifts always change.      So if we had a child, depending on the overlap of our schedules the child would be in daycare sometimes. But during weeks where I'm at work like 9am-7am and my husband is working late night, he wouldn't have to be because one of us would always be at home. Kind of confuzing, but you get what I mean?      I just want a realistic idea of how much time\energy a child takes up.. I realise its no picnic.. but I am very serious with my career, being a SAHM is not an option for me financially or emotionally.. I couldn't be at home all day.      Do you feel like its constantly "Baby this, and baby that" or do you have other things in your life that you are able to do??

20090219222432AACArlR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Finding babys sex/gender at 13wks 5days??? ACCURATE?	I have a question for other pregnant women that are further along or on 2nd 3rd etc child. my friend is due the exact same date as me (aug. 19th) and she went in 2 days ago for one of the 3d sonos and lied to the technichians and told them she was 18-19 weeks so that they would try to find her babys sex at 13wks 5days the tech told her its a girl..my question is How reliable do you think this info is at only 13 wks 5 days? Im not going for my sex sonogram until march and at that i will still only be 17wks so they arent sure they will see much but since she lied do you think the techs were accurate???      at this point im somewhat jealous of my friend that she found out so early and i still have to wait what seems like SOOO much longer even though we are due the same date thats why im asking because i dont want to go for an early sono. and then have it be wrong like it could be with hers      also i agree that any tech regardless of it being a real doctor or not would be able to tell the difference between 13wks 5days and 18-19 wks im just saying what she told them to get into a 3d sono place and get her appointment after she was in there im sure the person noticed a size difference      Sorry for a repeat question im just really trying to figure this out because she is so so early in my opinion

20090219222544AAV8tax	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Girls who dont want babies have them, and women who want them cant?	How is that fair.    Your on here looking at peoples questions and alot of them are freaking out because they might have accidently gotten pregnant. Then you have women who would probably sell a right arm to get pregnant and they just have problems and complications.      no question here really, just felt like pointing that out.
20090219221637AAjteL2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Is it to soon to have another baby?	We have a five year old daughter and a five month old baby. We have been talking for a couple of weeks now about maybe trying to have another one. Both us us want three kids so for a couple of reasons I want another baby. First I am so baby hungry already, and second after waiting almost five years to have another child I know that's not the way to do it. We figure why get the the point where your child is in school and you have a little time to yourself and are able to sleep through the night, and then start from square one again. I just worry that it's to soon, not physically, but I don't want to take away from the darling little baby I have now. Any suggestions?

20090219223053AA85lub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why is it that after you have an epidural if labour stops, why does it have to progress? Why can't you wait?	Like, if you are in labour in a hospital or at home and it stops, they give you the choice of doing something to get it started again, or you wait for everything to shut down, and go back to waiting for labour again. Why is it that if you've had an epidural and it stops, there's no choice and they break your waters etc. Why can't they just monitor you and your baby while it leaves your system and send you home? Is it just because it's so expensive they don't want to waste it or what? I mean why is it that labour has to continue or it's a cesarean just because you've had one even if your waters are intact? Any other time it's just accepted that if labour stops, it's just normal and they ask if you want to go home and wait for it to start again or for established labour to happen. Is there a medical reason for this?
20090219221858AAEfNqi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does getting your tubes tied lower your sex drive?	I know it sounds weird, but I'm 25 I have 3 kids and I got my tubes tied last year.

20090219222144AAIRNrW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Can I sue for not being informed?	I just found out that the birth control I was taking was recalled back in March of 2006 and December of 2007 (along with some other months) Apparently it was recalled because the hormone levels weren't high enough to prevent pregnancy. My pharmacist never informed me nor did I recieve any information regarding the recall. Ironically, I became pregant in March of 2006 and had a son, and December of 2007 and had a miscarriage. Now I love my son, and I wouldn't change having him for the world, but his pregnancy was definitely not planned, nor the one after. I think I should have been informed about the recall, is there actually something I could do legally?
20090219223616AANVRPs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Period Problems and Infertility?	In tenth grade, I was told that I had ovarian cysts. I had gone to the doctor because ever since I have had my period, I have always been irregular. There was a time where I went 7 months without one! Since then, I have had pains in my cervix, and once had an inflammed/strawberry cervix and another time where it was blue due to too much oxygen. I am worried that all these problems have posed me as being infertile. I have had unprotected sex before but nothing happened with it. Has anyone had similar problems and been able to have kids? What are my chances of actually conceiving? :(

20090219222309AAwB2lW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Are natural or gel nails better when having a newborn?	I'm using my husband's account. I'm 35 weeks pregnant and have gel nails and get them done every three weeks. I'm thinking I may not have time to get my nails re-done every three weeks but I'm not sure because this is my first baby. But if I take them off and keep them short I feel they may be sharp and hurt the baby. The gel nails are not sharp. What's better?
20090219222758AAircjT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could this be pregnancy?	I have a stomach ache that feels not like a flu ache but more of a muscle ache. It has been there for a few weeks straight. Tonight I got REALLY mad for no reason. My sisters were talking and I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs and now I just got a minor dizzy spell. I  I also feel the sensation to vomit on and off during the day. The nausea has been going on and off for a week or two as well. I am awaiting my period but it is irregular. Could it be what I think it is?      I asked this question before and some said it sounds like period symptoms but    1) I don't usually pms   and   2) Would I be nauseous for weeks just from pms?      Help!      And I was sitting here and slow music came on and I got teary lol. What is going on?

20090219223540AARL6Zw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I need to interview a parent with a child who has Down syndrome for my high school class?	For an essay I have to write in english I need to interview a parent with a child who has down syndrome, considering my topic. I have just eight questions to ask about the subject of using plastic surgery to alter one with Down's appearance, which some parents have already gone to. I am in no way trying to offend any one by these questions but just need some personal answers due to my research. If you cannot yourself answer these questions but can have someone else answer them please give them these questions as well. Thanks to anyone who is willing to help!!! Here are my questions------      1. How old is your child with Down syndrome?   2. What was your first reaction to knowing that your child had Down’s?   3. Did you think of the future being difficult for your child because of their condition?   4. How did others around you react to the diagnosis?   5. Have you ever thought of changing your child’s appearance to make them look more, to what some may say ‘normal’?   6. There have been a couple of parents who have already altered their child with Down’s appearance surgically, what is your take on that?   7. Would you consider or would you have ever considered changing your child’s looks now that you know of this being an option.   8. Is this morally right to you that people are doing this because they are personally bothered by their child?      Thank you once again for giving your imput, it is greatly appreciated.
