20090227125824AAM01b6	Environment;Green Living	What are some ways that *I* can be "greener"?	I didn't exactly grow in the most earth-friendly home... my parents didn't recycle, we left lights on all the time, had about four SUVs in the driveway, etc.      Anyway, I've been out of my house for about five years, and am much better with things like turning off the lights before I leave, shutting off electronics, etc., but I would like to be better than that. What are some things I can do myself that will help me be "greener?" I don't drive... I walk everywhere. I also bring my own bag to the grocery store and I don't have washer/dryer machine in my apartment.
