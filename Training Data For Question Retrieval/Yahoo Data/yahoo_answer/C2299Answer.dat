4Rp142qqaa	Scusi se mi permetto, ma le credo che non ha trovato lavoro se ai concorsi per diventare insegnante scrive come ha fatto adesso senza mettere maiuscole, accenti e utilizzando una forma italiana assai discutibile, capisco che siamo in internet ma un professore che si rivolge ai ragazzi dovrebbe per lo meno scrivere loro in italiano corretto visto che deve dare l'esempio,  inutile parlare di avvocati, ingegneri e lavori simili se non si sa neache scrivere in italiano.    Detto questo,  vero che una laurea in lettere non offre molte possibilit di lavoro rispetto ad una laurea in legge, ingegneria e medicina. E' anche vero per che ci sono moltissimi laureati in queste discipline che lei consiglia di intraprendere che per sono degli incapaci e non sanno fare il loro mestiere e di conseguenza sono anche disoccupati, viceversa conosco persone che con una laurea in lettere, hanno ottenuto lavori molto rispettabili di un certo rilievo e non precari, l'importante  essere bravi nel titolo che si prende e darsi da fare, meglio un laureato in lettere nei tempi con 110 e lode che un  laureato in ingegneria con il minimo dei voti e magari uscito dopo i 30 anni.     Non si pu generalizzare come ha fatto lei, una persona deve fare ci che si sente e ci per cui  portato e darsi da fare, inoltre se lei  uscito a 28 anni significa che ci ha impiegato 9 anni per laurearsi in lettere (se ha iniziato l'universit a 19 anni nei tempi giusti), non ha pensato che forse lettere non era l'indirizzo adatto a lei? Molto probabilmente  per questo che poi nel suo ambito lavorativo non ha avuto successo..      Non mi sembra di avere offeso nessuno, ho espresso le mie opinioni da persona civile senza utilizzare parole volgari.  A me non interessa se lei ha avuto problemi o non poteva mantenersi, perch TUTTI abbiamo i nostri problemi e ci sono un mucchio di studenti che studiando e lavorando riescono a laurearsi nei tempi pur avendo i loro problemi anche loro. Perch non dice ai ragazzi che il mondo del lavoro tiene conto anche dell'et e della preparazione dei laureati, ai datori di lavoro non fregher niente se hai avuto problemi per laurearti, loro prendono le persone che si sono laureate nei tempi e questa non  una cosa da sottovalutare. Detto questo la saluto perch per quanto mi riguarda potrebbe anche non essere un professore e non tiri fuori la storia del computer, perch anche i miei prof non erano molto veloci a scrivere per almeno scrivevano in maniera corretta, non nascondiamoci dietro scuse banali come i bambini.|`|yZQdsPpcaa	salve prof. volevo una sua consulenza... mi sn diplomato  quest anno a ragioneria ottenenendo un buon puntegg (100).... sin da subito mi sn posto il problema della scelta universitaria indeciso se scegliere  economia oseguire le mie reali passioni per la scienza.... la cosa nn  stata facile e alla fine ho deciso di iscrivermi a chimica e tecnologie farmaceutiche, escludendo economia o legge in quanto le ritengo noiose e lontanne dale mie passioni...... come giudica la mia scelta? pensa k potr farcela pur nn avendo frequentato un liceo scientif? in questi giorni ho un serio timore ank perke nn conosco nessuno degli iscritti alla facolt. la prego mi dia consigli utili. grazie sin d'ora.|`|c158ce836408cbd93311c81cb1af8c1caa	...Beh, sentire vari pareri  una buona cosa.

Non  un tipo di studi direttamente collegato alle materie che ho affrontato al liceo, anzi si studiano cose completamente diverse..Per mi affascina molto il diritto e in futuro mi piacerebbe avere un lavoro che mi consenta di contribuire a far rispettare la legge e a difendere chi subisce abusi e ingiustizie.

E come lettere ce ne sono molte che sono ancora pi inutili vedasi scienze delle comunicazioni o tutte le altre psico-pedo-para-psicologie, per non parlare poi di scienze ambientali, laurea clone di altre lauree come geologia biologia chimica e altre, nata per il solo interesse di di far mangiare a sbafo le lobby accafdemiche.   Purtroppo questa generazione che vuol avvicinarsi al sapere dimostra solo idealismo e poco senso pratico, di certo se questo  il futuro della nazione...allora la nazione non avr futuro.  Ma dico io i vostri genitori non vi prendono a calci in culo quando dite loro di iscrivervi a scienze delle merendine?
LIZxsxVxaa	ciao,stai tranquillo...anche io sono una studentessa fuori sede.frequento la facolta di mediazione linguistica a pescara e sto li da 2 anni,quest'anno  il terzo...ti parlo per esperienza personale,all'inizio mi trovavo un po fuori posto,forse perche nn avevo le mie amiche con me,ma poi ho conosciuto delle persone formidabili con cui ho subito legato,per fortuna,e   adesso mi sento a casa!!!! normale che all'inizio ti troverai forse un po spaesato,ma se hai qualche dubbio sulle procedure e il resto puoi sempre chiedere agli altri ragazzi o in segreteria...e poi per il mangiare c' la mensa che  aperta sia a pranzo che a cena sette giorni su sette,e il giovedi e sabato sera fanno anche pizza.....ciao e in bocca al lupo...      Si,certo...  La citta di Pescara  abbastanza tranquilla, carina e si sta molto bene.....  Nel corso di mediazione ci sono prof. molto in gamba, di cui ne vale veramente la pena seguire le lezioni...ma purtroppo ci sono anche dei prof. che nn sanno fare il suo lavoro, che non sono molto disponibili, ma per fortuna questi non sono molti...  a volte succedera che ti cambiano l'orario delle lezioni,o almeno all'inizio del semestre  cos...oppure che ti cambino l'aula all'ultimo minuto,ma alla fine ci fai l'abitudine, anzi ti sembrera strano se almeno una volta non succede!!!!apparte questo si sta bene...  ti consiglio di seguire il pi possibile le lezioni,anche se il prof ti sta antipatico,ma soprattutto di seguire la linguistica, che ritroverai praticamente in tutte le altre materie,soprattutto nella teoria della traduzione...  hai gia deciso che lingue studierai?......  se vuoi chiedermi qualcos'altro sono a tua disposizione.....!!!  ciao.....        beh puoi sempre scegliere una delle due lingue come esame a scelta per i primi due anni...hai letto la guida dello studente?sta sul sito dell'universita:www.unich.it  io studio inglese e ho come prima lingua spagnolo,e con i prof mi sono trovata molto bene,soprattutto con il lettore del secondo anno,molto preparato...e poi alcuni sono molto simpatici.quelli di russo non li conosco quindi su questo non ti posso aiutare.  per la casa si, credo che una decente puoi trovarla,almeno per il primo anno,poi se non ti piace la puoi sempre cambiare...intanto vedi qualche sito di annunci.....ciao ;-)|`|ZZ7cluA4aa	il mio motto  "se lo fanno tutti perch non lo posso fare anche io!?".    per il fatto che stai ricominciando a studiare dopo vari anni stai tranquillo: anche il mio ragazzo ha lavorato per tre anni e ha cominciato ingengeria a 22 anni, all'inizio era spaesato e riprendere in mano i libri gli  costato un po' di fatica. ma ha studiato con qualche compagno, si  messo d'impegno e ora si laurea. l'importante in questo caso  sentirsi convinti e motivati!     e per la burocrazia... stai tranquillo che  incomprensibile per tutti! io sono al 5 anno, sto preparando la tesi e ancora adesso non ci capisco niente e ogni volta che devo andare in segreteria mi viene lo sconforto! io uso la seguente tecnica: a costo di sembrare mongola chiedo le cose dieci volte diverse a dieci persone diverse, poi unisco le informazioni e vedo se mi soddisfano, altrimenti inizio a inondare il mio dipartimento di mail, prima o poi da qualche segreteria qualcuno mi risponder!    per cucinare: tu sei proprio a zero? una pasta te la fai? altrimenti ci sono tante buste pronte tipo 4 salti in padella, poi quando torni a casa ti fai preparare da amici e parenti delle teglie di cose da surgelare e per un po' di tempo sei a posto! investi in un forno a microonde magari!!    io sono sicura che ce la farai!|`|bC2nZBS1aa	Calma e sangue freddo:  tutto quello che ti occorre sapere su burrocrazia e altro lo trovi sia sulle guide universitarie che potrai ritirare in segreteria studenti che chiedendo nella stessa segretaria.  Inoltre all'interno della facolt troverai i cosiddetti tutor, studenti che inalcuni giorni della settimana si mettono a disposizione di tutti per dare le opportune informazioni.  Inoltre ti verr assegnato anche un professore tutor che potr guidarti all'interno delle tue perplressit.  Il segreto per essere un buon studente  massimizzare il tempo, una volta "scelte" le materie da dare, calcola il numero totale di pagine di cui si compongono i tuoi libri e dividile per i giorni che hai a disosizione per studiare e facendoti quelle poche paginette al giorno non ci sar materia che ti resister!  inoltre vai a lezione prendi appunti e utilizza i giorni di ricevimento dei docenti per eventuali chiarimenti.  Per approfondimenti utilizza la biblioteca universitaria.  Per cucinare si impara e poi c' sempre la mensa, fonte di misteriosi veleni ma anche di amicizie.  Impara anche a fare le pulizie di casa vedrai perch vedrai che purtroppo a loro non scamperai!  Per il resto cerca di condurre una vita divertente ma regolare e vedrai che non incontrerai particolari problemi.  P.s.  Per case in affitto, ripetizioni o gruppi di studio trovi gli annuncu tutti nelle mense, in facolt e nelle segreterie.|`|K8uVugJ5aa	ciao! ianche io sono fuori sede (anche se solo a 100km da casa.. ma cmq durante le lezioni abito in sede universitaria..) e ti posso dire che non si soffre troppo.. la cosa che pi ti consiglio  di legare con i colleghi del posto.. sai loro ti possono alleviare molto la mancanza di casa.. io grazie a dei colleghi sono riuscito ad ambientarmi molto bene, ogni tanto esco con loro la sera o il pomeriggio, in questo modo sono riuscito ad imparare le strade della nuova citt e a conoscere nuovi ragazzi per avere una vita sociale anche in un posto che fino a qualche mese fa mi sembrava ignoto e spaventoso..sono stato cmq fortunato a trovare delle persone bravissime come colleghi con i quali ho legato facilmente(pensa ieri mi sono venuti perfino a trovare nel mio paese 2 di loro..).. beh per cucinare anche io ero una frana, ma basta imparare a farsi la pasta e a fare qualcosa di semplice come frittate e uova sode, carne.. non c' bisogno di fare piatti elaborati per "sopravvivere".. e poi mal che vada ci sono le mense universitarie dove i prezzi per gli studenti sn molto bassi e puoi fare un pasto completo.. per quanto riguarda lo studio nn preoccuparti e nn bloccarti alle prime difficolta.. io ho una collega che ha ripreso a studiare a 42 anni e altri di 30 35 e se la cavano tutti benone.. forza e coraggio.. inizia la nuova avventura col piede giusto.. dove ti iscrivi?

XqoJTdAMaa	Vedi purtroppo in Italia si sta verificando il contrario dei paesi in via di sviluppo, infatti in quei paesi si sta formando con molta fatica una middle class (classe media) mentre qui da noi la middle class sta sparendo e si crea sempre pi il divario tra ricchi e poveri, tipico dei paesi del terzo e quarto mondo.    C' chi spende quella cifra solo in benzina al mese per alimentare il suo cayenne 5000, e c' chi guadagna 800 euro al mese lavorando 8 ore al giorno.  Duemila euro sono circa 4 milioni del vecchio conio, ottimi soldi negli anni 90 ma in effetti il potere d'acquisto oggi  calato molto, a causa dell'inesistente controllo delle autorit su commercianti che hanno raddoppiato il costo a 1000 lire = 1 euro.    Mi fa sorridere il commerciante che incolpa lo stato di non aver fatto nulla per contenere questo fenomeno quando proprio lui  il primo ad evadere le tasse non emettendo scontrini o facendo pagare una coca cola 3 euro.    Io poi vivo a Milano una realt esagertamente cara rispetto molte altre zone dell'Italia.  Ovvio che se vivi in un paesino della basilicata 2000 euro sono dei bei gran soldi ma qui da noi non sono poi molti.    Tolte le spese di casa, l'eventuale mutuo bollo e assicurazione di una o 2 macchine, spesa per mangiare non rimane poi molto.    Poi vedi il dvd o il televisore al plasma che puoi comprare con comode rate in 2 anni allora via che lo prendi, quindi ti accorgi che la linea interntet a 56 k oggi  inamissibile allora via che si fa il contratto adsl minimo 40 euro al mese. E il cellulare per essere sempre reperibili... e elettrodomestici vari essenziali e via con piccoli prestiti.. in tv non fanno nulla di interessante allora via con sky o quell'altro... alla fine ti rendi conto che entrano 2000 euro e te ne escono 2500.....    Mumble mumble c' qualcosa che non va!    Allora via con prestiti vari e carte di credito,  pensa che siamo il paese con persone pi indebitate del mondo intero.....  L'altro rovescio della medaglia, quadri e manager che guadagnano 150 mila euro all'anno e vari benefit, gente che apre e chiude aziende fantasma lucrandoci su, gente che si inventa ogni tipo di consulenza per guadagnarci su e non parliamo di politicanti e loro compensi........      Che dirvi si 2000 euro bastano a tirare a fine mese basta vivere modestamente riesci anche a mettere via 1000 euro per farti un last minute in agosto.....

L je te parle de passage pour ensuite  l'issue du bac tu t'oriente vers un bac +2 minimum.

Il faut que tu saches ou tu te situes et c'est mieux si tu as un projet defini. Apparemment ce sont plutot les sciences mais ne ngligent pas les autres matieres surtout les langues qui plus tard te serviront comme dans un entretien d'embauche en entreprise ou la maitrise de l'anglais est aujourd'hui primordiale. De plus les bacs sont des examens gnraux: c'est- a dire que tu peux obtenir un bac s avec de trs bonnes notes dans les matires littraires et inversement. Il ne faudra pas seulement bosser les gros coeff comme le font beaucoup de lyceens. Si bien lorsque par exemple, ils entrent en premiere anne de mdecine, le bac en poche grace a de bonnes notes dans les matieres litteraires, ils echouent car au lycee ils avaient pris la mauvaise filiere meme s'ils s'en sortaient moyennement en sciences et maths.

yxNPmoviaa	It depends on the person you are, really.    Making friends is always a touchy subject, because some people are shy on the first day, while some are really loud and outgoing.    The first week is always hard though. Getting used to the schedule, finding your way around the building. New rules, new teachers, new faces.    Sometimes harder classes, others are easy.    High school was a great experience, its something that I will never forget, and wish I could relive. You will have a great time. Just keep your mind open, and yourself outgoing. Dont be too afraid, you might miss out on some things |`|bMr7g2pUaa	ghmghmhmgh|`|iXQuSNtqaa	High school, socially, can be tough, hopefully some of your friends from middle school will be joining you so you won't be completely lonely. But there are other people from other schools that will be joining you so it should be easy to make friends over the first couple days. But high school is pretty much about social status and a lot of stereotypes and judgment. Be sure you have your friends and their support. People can change.    But once you get comfortable...they are the best 4 years of education you could possibly have.     It is easy to get lost, try to get a tour with your parents or a counselor.|`|qCAmW9hlaa	i dont really know what you mean by n block r block, but if your saying its hard to find your classrooms and everything then its not true they will usually give you a map. even at my school they r doing loads of construction work and i still get around fine.  you make friends within the first few days i was worried when i didnt meet anyone on orientation and now im in year 9 and i have loads of friends. youll be fine.
obmWf0pJaa	after getting through undergraduate and law school, i understand your point. the answer took me a while to really sink into my hard cranium...it depends on what type of learner you are.     most people learn best with one method over the others. listening, doing, seeing, talking are all ways to learn. i think the vast majority can learn with more than one method. i learn best when i read and then either talk or listen to the material so that it forces me to think about it. this means that attending class is hugely more valuable than just looking at the lecture notes, because it allows me to take in another medium. i think many people are in the same boat, and a few are simply listen learners.     going to class also allows you to ask questions about things that confuse you over the notes. there may be some more points that are added in the lecture that do not make it onto the slides. maybe some focus of the test that the professor chooses not to add to slides.     there could also be a hot girl/guy in the class that could be worth sitting next to in hopes that you can get to know them. while this is a tongue-in-cheek joke, it is a very realistic goal of undergraduate studies--to allow you to get to know people in the classes that interest you. you will have people that share your interests seated all around, and that could come in handy for networking or just making friends.     my main point is that you pay good money to attend school, and any opportunity to get the most out of it is worth your time and effort. don't think that you are not getting anything from attending classes, because it really does open doors in the long run. think about that next time you find it hard to get out of bed for that 8 am lecture on anthropology.

LsAArkUyaa	There isn't "material for Mississippi"    According to MS law you are free to use any curriculum you chose.  http://www.mhea.net/    You can check to above link for homeschool groups in your area. Local groups are usually the best resources in finding material locally. However there is no requirement that you buy locally.    Where you buy really depends on what type of curriculum you want to use.    2 of my favorites are  http://www.learningthings.com/  http://www.rainbowresource.com/index.php      For complete boxed curriculum I suggest  http://www.oakmeadow.com/  http://www.calvertschool.org/calvert-sch... - a little heavy on worksheets especially in the earlier grades|`|AA10289917	You should be able to do a search on home school supplies in Mississippi.

Good luck!|`|JnXmSLDfaa	I home schooled 6 children for about 8 years and got most of what I used from other home schooling families who had finished with those levels  with their own children, for a very small cost.    I also called our school board and home school office  and found that I was in titled to go to the book depository for our county and take whatever books, materials that I wanted for free.  Those had been discarded by the school system and school libraries and it was a treasure trove of wonderful items.  They sent me a letter of authorization and the location and that was it.    Used book stores and Goodwill and Salvation Army also had many text books that were excellent for almost nothing.  Getting materials was the easiest part of home schooling.  Baking cookies and following receipts and using measurements are a wonderful way to teach also.    Good luck, it will be worth it and your rewards will be your children's' future.|`|oqK4ADssaa	Since there is no particular curriculum for Mississippi you can start at your local Walmart for younger kids. They have work books in the toy department that are great. For older kids who need a more balanced curriculum there are a wealth of them out there. We use Sonlight and Math U See. and love them. It all depends on the education you want give your kids.

It is not necessary to put the word "she" twice in the sentence.    Q2:  The farmer sowed a seed about "a" year ago.  The article would be the word "a".  See below for the definition of an article (as relating to grammar).    Grammar. any member of a small class of words, or, as in Swedish or Romanian, affixes, found in certain languages, as English, French, and Arabic, that are linked to nouns and that typically have a grammatical function identifying the noun as a noun rather than describing it. In English the definite article is the, the indefinite article is a or an, and their force is generally to impart specificity to the noun or to single out the referent from the class named by the noun. |`|6AxMy4WMaa	try this i don't know if its correct for question 1    "She will work overtime if she will be paid for it"  how was that??    in question two try letter "a" but i think year is not proper for the sentence how bout  a days or week??     hope it helps you!

Nel prossimo anno la sforbiciata sar pi consistente (- 42mila posti), poi nel 2010 se ne elimineranno circa 25.500 e lanno successivo poco meno di 20mila. Il ministro dellIstruzione Mariastella Gelmini e gli esponenti del governo hanno pi volte precisato che non di licenziamenti si tratta, ma di una riorganizzazione che di fatto precluder la possibilit della riconferma per migliaia di docenti con rapporto di lavoro precario. I tagli non risparmieranno nemmeno gli Ata ovvero il personale non docente, il cui organico complessivo verr abbattuto del 17 per cento: 44.500 tra direttori amministrativi (- 10mila), collaboratori scolastici (- 29mila), amministrativi e assistenti tecnici (- 4mila) tutti appartenenti al personale non docente. La scuola conta circa 1 milione e 100mila occupati, la riduzione complessiva quindi riguarda oltre il 10 per cento del personale del comparto istruzione.   Per quanto riguarda l'universit i provvedimenti della Gelmini  prevedono tagli al turn over dei docenti e al Fondo ordinario. Inoltre, le Universit possono determinare la propria trasformazione in fondazioni di diritto privato, con una deliberazione del Senato accademico a maggioranza assoluta ed approvata con decreto del Ministero dell'istruzione.

nO4WdZ9laa	Depends...if ur diploma is Post Graduate Diploma (Dip. Arch), yes..u r architect (Part II-recognized as architect part II by ur local profesional organization).but if it only dip. architecture...i would say u r only draughtsperson.    A simple explanation for u-if u want to be an architect, u must at least complete 5 years degree in architecture (Part I and Part II) and spend a further period of at least 2 years gaining experience before being allowed to take the Part III examination in Professional Practice and Management.    But I think, the requirement might slightly differ for every country.Further information u should check ur local organization.    Good luck

OLCoFKQraa	Well as far as the curse, God created humans knowing that they had no knowledge, including not knowing morals or the difference better right and wrong, and yet expected them to make an informed choice about whether to eat from the tree of knowledge, they couldn't possibly know whether or not to eat it's fruit until after they already did, and not to mention, why did god purposely put the tree there? Isn't that kind of like leaving a pile of garbage on the floor and then getting angry at a dog for eating it? God created everything, why did he create a talking snake? God clearly is not good, because he set Adam and Eve up, he told them not to eat something, and then went about creating the circumstances where they inevitably would do exactly that, like God wanted them to  So why did he have to tease them, he could've just kicked them out of eden on day 1, why wait and p1ss fart about with a bunch of silly trees and snakes and stuff?|`|WvqRJow1aa	Christianity or any religion for that matter, evolved so that we as human beings would live as human beings and be differentiated from an animal existence.  ---------  God's wrath is a lesson that our actions have consequences we are accountable for. If I kept getting away with what I did because whoever I acted against is good enough to forgive it, I would only be a nuisance apart from an animal. I would never see the impact of my ways on other lives. Think of it as Newtons Law for Dummies.  ---------  I have not come across slavery being justified directly in the bible. A tip here would be helpful.  As for the issue of women, I would again see it as a requirement to be faithful to their spouse. Definitely does not sound like slavery and submission but rather a woman should have the upkeep of her husband, family and home in sight.   ---------  Hehehe.. I like this one. Where there is oppression there is God. Besides, if God went about spreading His Word Himself, what would be our participation in it ? He said, Let Me hang around in Palestine (great food, good weather) and let My people enjoy the gift of sharing Me and revealing My glory and goodness to the rest of the world. Much like having job references in your resume. You could brag about yourself, but it's great when someone else blows your horn.  ------  I don't get what you mean by the last one.
S6W4IMfYaa	CONCENTRATION IN STUDIES IS JUST LIKE, WHEN U DO THING WHICH ARE OF INTEREST TO YOU.    EG: I LISTEN IN CLASS AND THAT'S ALL, I READ ONCE B4 GOING TO EXAMS. WHEN I FOUND OUT MY WAY, I PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS, THINKING THAT I CANNOT SIT AND STUDY AT THE LAST MOMENT.    ITS THE SAME FOR ALL, FIND UR SELF INTERESTED IN IT AND JOB DONE.    CONCENTRATION IS NOTHING BUT, FINDING UR SELF INTERESTED IN WHATEVER U ARE DOING.|`|R4F05z4Faa	Wear MOTI in silver ring  more info please contact shanoomathur@yahoo.co.in|`|IzCCoKNoaa	HELLO BUDDY............  This is common thing that one loses concentration while working; this is not because of the lack of interest. You just lose the ability to think about the work you are doing. Losing concentration is not the problem that is always faced while studying but the situation can be faced while you are playing cards or watching movie. If you want to reduce this thing then you should have to focus on the task and have to restrict your mind towards the work you are doing only. Do not let your mind to think about your other worries or do not indulge yourself to the activities that are going on outside.     To avoid this problem you must consider few of the things like keep yourself away from your mobile, select an appropriate place for study, and do not sit in rushy and noisy area while studying. Another reason of losing the concentration is the lack of interest in the subject you are studying; if this is so then make your subject interesting for you so that to develop the interest. Select an appropriate time to study like if you feel that you can study well at night than in day then make your study schedule for night.    CHEERZ & CONCENTRATE......|`|f28bacdbeee33dfab7e1ab04684ac58faa	Dear Pal    people who can concentrate for long use different tactics to do so. First of all select a place where you will be least disturbed.  then adopt a comfortable sitting position, thirdly divide your total study period in to small pieces so that you get time to take a break. Let these periods be of 20-30 minutes each. Start with an easy subject to built up your confidence level. If you want to remember formulas  it is better you write them in one single sheet with color pens. reading loud also helps to concentrate for long.

Also, he had awoken his people to realize what destruction the bad guys have brought about.

lCtl1L3kaa	Because we write the way we speak.  When you write creatively, you choose words that express the kind of emotion you'd want your voice to convey.  You write to grab their attention as if they were in the room.  You choose your words as if you're watching their expressions as they hear your story.|`|FYd1ndVxaa	indifferent for me|`|q8Th3Gdfaa	because when you write your exploring your imagination and anything can happen|`|llWG48GFaa	I guess cause there always IS an audience. Even if you're writing for yourself, you go back and read it. You're kind of the the judge. When other people read whatever you wrtie they kind of judge you too. That's just my take. Could be wrong.
lJvUpszNaa	Don't stress about it.    Just go in and do your best!    Some people take prep classes.  If you have the time and money you might want to try that.  Otherwise you could buy a prep book on your own and work on it.|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Just to add on to the previous advice. Get a good night's rest. It's a LONG test.

Good luck!|`|l9PQDVYNaa	First, it would help to know how to spell succeed.    Go to Barnes and Noble, or Borders, and pick up one of those huge SAT books, work through it and you will be very prepared.    If you have the money you could also take a weekly class.

FgyE9Rthaa	You need to answer one question:  Do you want to change for her, or for yourself?  If you are thinking about changing for someone else, you will blame them every time the struggle gets too hard, or you fail at your goal.  If you know that you need to change, and want to do it for yourself, then you need to work on that first.    It sounds like you already know that you shouldn't be doing drugs.  The girl that you are with is an easy out for you; she isn't requiring anything from you. But how would she feel if you do change?  And how would you feel about her?  You might change, and things don't work out and you lose both of them, but if you change for yourself, then it is worth it, and you will be happier in the long run.|`|FbTqb3uUaa	Go for the classy girl.

zhJOZhKEaa	I've helped two friends whose kids use SOS math.  It is very dry and very, very *picky*.  If you don't type in the answer in *just* the form they have it in the machine counts it *wrong*.  Typically this leads to the student spinning their wheels for half the day trying to figure out why they don't get something they really *do* understand... or they just assume the machine has it in a different form and never know for sure what they missed till you come through and check it.    We have used SOS for language (which is also picky but not as bad) and it does make schedule planning easy.  It is for the subjects you are using SOS for only... but it lets you skip days or reschedules everything for you in an instant when you have to miss a day of SOS for any reason.      I don't *hate* SOS... but I just don't see it working for math at all.  It can be dry here and there... not quite as bad as LifePacs (tutored friends with those too) but still dry.  It is ok if you are just using it for a couple of subjects... it really was nice to just send him to do his work when I'm busy with a baby.  I just can't see him doing it all day everyday.  That 'tiny tutor' just gets a little old after awhile.    ETA: Ah... sorry I misread that thinking you were still trying to talk yourself into the SOS for everything.  Like I said... for a few subjects... it can work.  But I reeeeally wouldn't use it for more than a couple of subjects at a time personally.  Good luck with your decision!|`|9HRkwzruaa	Honestly...unless your daughter learns extremely well by sitting on the computer, I wouldn't.  Heck, my son does learn well in front of the computer, and he was bored silly by it.  I've heard very few good reports about this curriculum.  It's really just a computerized version of the LifePacs, which are dry as dirt.    JMHO.    You might want to try something like BJU?  They offer video courses on DVD or a Hard Drive that you hook up to a computer or laptop, and they're really well made.  It's a switch from Sonlight, but to something that's well done, challenging, and interesting.  It also has the lesson plans set up in advance and is really kid and mom friendly.

429f9a84976c90d00835cb072174dd5caa	Ideally it should be something that interests you, but perhaps more importantly, the question that you choose to investigate should have some kind of conclusion to it. Dissertation questions that have conclusions of "there is a lot of evidence to support hypothesis 1 and 2 so we need more study before we can come to a conclusion" will not fly well with the person who marks it.    Also make sure that the individual who will supervise is someone that you can work with. If someone is supervising an intersting area but you know is 1) never available 2) isn't big on feedback, then pick another topic. Pick a supervisor who will talk to you rather than at you, pick someone who can inspire you. That will help in getting a good mark.|`|23b9ed80f56808781db076a2792062f7aa	Are you at the point where you need one right now or are you planning ahead?  In the latter case, I'd recommend keeping a research journal and using your early graduate work cumulatively.  Everytime you come across something that interests you--an idea, a conversation, an article, whatever, write it in the journal.  Over time, you'll see a pattern among what interests you that should help you form some questions. Above all, discuss your interests and questions with everyone.  Talking about them out loud really helps you get to the core of what it is you want to know.  It has been suggested to me that one should (if you've got time before you have to have a finished proposal) make everything--every paper, seminar presentation, etc.--a step, no matter how small, toward your dissertation.      Sorry I can't be of much more help; I'm just at the beginning of my program, but I've been keeping a research journal for 7-8 months and talking to everyone I meet about what interests me.  I'm already developing more focused questions, despite being far from actually starting my diss.    Good luck!|`|bcf6ad65b269d8fee309b705f3635294aa	Think of a topic that inspires you first; second, think of a topic that can eventually help to generate a possitive cash flow; and third, think of a topic that will help to prepare you do do whatever avocation you will choose to pursue when all the writing is done.    It is rare when a dissertation topic choice can aid a student to do all three.  Prepare to be a tiny bit disappointed in your choice 10-20 years down the educational and vocational road.|`|a4cff5cb712a09a6ce5a1f4083213981aa	I am sure you have been assigned a supervisor.See him/her and discuss with him/her.You must have an area of interest.Focus on that area and try to see what topics you can work on .You can also make use of your departmental library to see the works people have done,and thus,extract a topic from them.Goodluck.|`|595408954755781de34a7c221a8eca76aa	Hi there    If you are in the phase of thinking about a dissertation topic you should start with an interest that you want to research and study. I am assuming you are in working on your PhD and seeking advice about how to start the process. There are two wonderful books called:    1) The Proposal Cookbook    and     2) The Dissertation and Research Cookbook    Both written by J. Bruce Francis and has a wealth of information and guidelines to help you get started.    Start doing papers that you are interested in and KEEP THEM the more you work on your topic the less time you will spend thinking and more time writing.    Try buying the books at Barnes and Nobles, Amazon, or an internet vendor. If that doesn't work you can always find the publisher.    Good luck!    K|`|AA11588449	think

a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	I'll try to put this in terms that are intuitive even though there's nothing intuitive about it.  Negative numbers are abstractions.  You can't hold a negative number of anything.    We'll start with positives, and use the classic, apples, and emphasize multiplication as "times".  If you add 3 apples to a stack 5 times, you have added 15.  3 x 5 = 15    Now, the stack has hundreds of apples, so we don't need to worry about running out.  We can represent taking apples with a negative number, so if you take 3 apples five times, you have taken 15.  -3 x 5 = -15    Now it gets trickier.  Just as you can't hold a negative number of things, a negative number of events cannot occur.  You could represent undoing an event as a negative number.  If you were to undo your adding 3 apples to the stack, each of five times, you would have removed 15 apples.  3 x -5 = -15    Finally, if you were to undo removing (both undoing and removing are negatives), you'll see.  In order to undo removing 3 apples, 5 times, you would have to ADD 15 apples.    -3 x -5 = 15    I hope that helps you understand.|`|def680773285bb059a699792109b8d3daa	Let's look at all the cases of multiplying signed numbers.    (1)   2*3 means two 3's, therefore a result of +6    (2)   2*-3 means two -3's which is another way of saying (-3) + (-3) = -6.  So positive times negative = negative    (3)   -2 * 3 = 3 * -2 and the reasoning for getting -6 is the same as case (2).  So negative times positive = negative    Now, your question about negative time negative.    First of all -2 means the "opposite of +2" and can be written -(+2).  So,    (4)   -2 * -3 = -(+2) * (-3) = - [2 * -3] = - (-6) which can be read the "opposite  of   -6"  which is +6.  Therefore,    -(-6) = +6 and we have a negative times negative is positive.    You could prove this for all real numbers if you replace the 2 and 3 with x and y.|`|fb9bb2b7f0068ac54b77c2cc4942c61eaa	Because it's like when you multiply a number wth zero, the answer will be zero. It's just like that|`|758977966849b7e20e90672fb42f3b9daa	it's by definition. (-1)(-1) = 1.    thus, putting any other number in place of the bracketed 1s will yield a positive answer.    eg. (-6)(-2) = (-1)(6)(-1)(2) = (-1)(-1)(6)(2) = (1)(12) = 12|`|bbf5cc30a431982ef3a78b98c16cf51faa	i think because this is the rule...

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	I am sorry but I took my exams in May so I don't know my score yet. The only exams I took that were similar to yours was the Bio exam which I took at the HL level and the English HL exam. I studied for about 15 hours for Bio and about  6 hours for English. I was sick during study leave so I mostly crammed the night before. I didn't really go to teachers for help. I had the Bio bible which is Allot's book. English was all about looking for key passages/lines that could be integrated with any essay. In terms of school days and weekends, I just set my priorities. I did a ton of extracurriculars being the editor of two publications and president of three clubs. I put all of my energy into one task then moved on to another. That included homework as well. I recommend turning off MSN if you want to get some sleep. I averaged about 5 hours of sleep a night.    Anyways, buena suerte and good luck. You have some time before your exams. Start studying now and do it little by little if that is your style. Create a schedule and stick to it. Maybe review a chapter of bio a day as well as a chapter of math.|`|ni87Tez7aa	I miss high school sooooo much

KVkU6WSpaa	Human have a closed circulatory system, in that the blood is contained within a closed system of blood vessels.      In a open system (many insects, mollusks), the blood is pumped by a heart into the body cavities, where tissues and organs are surrounded by the blood.     Here is a link that shows the differences.    http://www2.gsu.edu/~bioasx/closeopen.ht...    Hope this helps!|`|E3Lheqoeaa	That's true. In creatures with open circulatory systems, the grasshopper comes to mind, their heart is just a pump that just gets blood to the upper end of their bodies, and it runs down to the rest before it's collected and the process starts again. A closed circulatory system is the opposite where blood is transported everywhere via blood vessels.
MAAxboH7aa	Where are you from? Sometimes the GPA standards for different countries, according to the level of their exams, are different. You might be surprised to find out that 2.5 in your country is 2.75 in Italy.  Of course, if it isn't, you can always go to an aducation counsellor, and he/she will be a lot of help.  When I wanted to go to the UK to further my studies, I had a GPA of 3.5. For the course I wished to pursue, the required GPA was 3.7. After going for a meeting with the counsellor I learnt that my GPA was good enough and on par with their standards anyway.

Ftkr9jqYaa	A dummy is not required when the algorithm is simple--that is, when there are no potential Rule 5 conflicts (i.e., no activity is composed of a set of activities, all of which are a subset of a more comprehensive activity).    Rule 5.  A dummy activity is needed when some activity, x, requires only a subset of activities (or a single activity) that is also required by some other activity, y.  These common activities (or activity) in the subset would be set up first, leading to some event (I)  whose declaration allows the logical start of x.  The uncommon activities in the set are leading to event (II), whose declaration would allow y to begin.  Since starting Y requires also the inputs of the common inputs, a dummy directed from (I) to (II) will be drawn.  Declaration of event (II) would mean that all inputs have been completed, and activity y can begin.    However, the complexity of the algorithm can be by far larger.  For example, x requires as inputs a subset of activities that y requires as inputs, while the inputs for y are only a subset of inputs required by z, etc.  In such cases, there are multiple dummy activities.    When there are multiple dummies, the primary goal of a PERT network may be resolution of the minimum-dummy-activities problem, since the project schedule with the fewest dummies will be optimal, in that it will correspond to the project arrangement that can be completed in the minimum time.

In his book A History of Writing, Steven Roger Fischer suggests that on the basis of finds at Saqqara, the reed pen might well have been used for writing on parchment as long ago as the First Dynasty or about 3000 BC. Reed pens continued to be used until the Middle Ages although they were slowly replaced by quills from about the seventh century.    The quill pen was used in Qumran, Judea to write some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and then introduced into Europe by around 700 AD. It was used in 1787 to write and sign the Constitution of the United States of America. The Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 on the northwest bank of the Dead Sea date back to around 100 BC. At that time they were written in Hebrew dialects with bird feathers or quills. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europeans had difficulty in obtaining reeds and began to use quills. There is a specific reference to quills in the writings of St. Isidore of Seville in the 7th century[3]. Quill pens were used until the nineteenth century.    A bronze nib was found in the ruins of Pompei showing that metal nibs were used in the year 79[4]. There is also a reference in Samuel Pepys' diary for August 1663. A metal pen point was patented in 1803 but the patent was not commercially exploited. John Mitchell of Birmingham started to massproduce pens with metal nibs in 1822[5]. During the 19th century metal nibs replaced quill pens. By 1850 the quality of steel nibs had improved and dip pens with metal nibs came into generalized use.       Waterman pen and fountain pens made for Air Frances ConcordeThe earliest historical record of a reservoir fountain pen dates back to the 10th century. In 953, Ma'd al-Mu'izz, the Fatimid Caliph of Egypt, demanded a pen which would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen which held ink in a reservoir and delivered it to the nib via gravity and capillary action.[6][7]    In his Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae (1636), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point.       M. Klein and Henry W. Wynne received US patent  68445 in 1867 for an ink chamber and delivery system in the handle of the fountain pen.Quill pens began being replaced with steel dip pens in the first years of the 1800s. In Newhall Street, John Mitchell pioneered mass production of steel pens. The first fountain pens making use of all these key ingredients appeared in the 1850s. While a student in Paris, Romanian Petrache Poenaru invented the fountain pen; an invention which the French Government patented in May 1827. Starting in the 1850s there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen patents and pens in production.    Slavoljub Eduard Penkala was a Croatian engineer and inventor who held over seventy patents. Slavoljub Penkala background was in chemistry, however, he is best known as the inventor of the first mechanical pencil first named the "automatic pencil", which he invented in 1906. Penkala started a factory called Penkala-Mostero for the manufacturing of his pens and pencils. http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinve...    Other inventions Slavoljub Penkala was noted for was the first solid-ink fountain pen in 1907, and the first Croatian two-seat airplane in 1909. He also patented a hot water bottle, detergent, a rail-car brake, and a anode. http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinve...      The first patent on a ballpoint pen was issued on October 30 1888, to John J Loud[8]. In 1938, Lszl Br, a Hungarian newspaper editor, with the help of his brother George, a chemist, began to work on designing new types of pens including one with a tiny ball in its tip that was free to turn in a socket. As the pen moved along the paper, the ball rotated, picking up ink from the ink cartridge and leaving it on the paper.    Br filed a British patent on June 15, 1938. In 1940 the Br brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, moved to Argentina fleeing Nazi Germany and on June 10, filed another patent, and formed Br Pens of Argentina. By the summer of 1943 the first commercial models were available[9]. Erasable ballpoint pens were introduced by Papermate in 1979 when the Erasermate was put on the market.[10]       Modern marker pensIn the 1960s the fibre, or felt-tipped pen was invented by Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company, Japan[11]. Papermate's Flair was among the first felt-tip pens to hit the U.S. market in the 1960s, and it has been the leader ever since. Marker pens and highlighters, both similar to felt pens, have become popular in recent years.    Rollerball pens were introduced in the ear|`|VjBciucZaa	green. this is long and     i                    n                t              e              r              e                    s                    t                    i                  n                        g                    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  1  2  3  z

cKiN7BLPaa	Here is how you can test it.   Some plastics undergo an unusual transition, from a hard, glassy state to a soft, rubbery state, with increased temperature. For this project, you should do background research on the effects of temperature on different types of plastics. Make sure that you understand the difference between thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers. You should also look for information on the glass transition temperature (Tg) for different plastics. Pure polyvinyl acetate has a Tg of 28C (about 82F). You can make a sample of this polymer by pouring some Elmer's Glue-All into a plastic bowl or plate and allowing it to evaporate for several days. Cut strips of the resulting material for your experiments. Try dipping the strip into warm water and immediately wrap it around a pen or pencil to make a spiral. Dip it in ice water. Describe the properties of the polymer at the two temperatures. What happens if the spiral is reheated? Additives in the glue may shift the Tg away from that of pure polyvinyl acetate. Use water heated to different temperatures to determine the Tg for your polymer. Other plastics, such as polystyrene (recycling code  6), have higher Tgs. With an adults help, you can investigate these materials using boiling water. (To raise the temperature of boiling water slightly higher, add a few tablespoons of salt. Search on "colligative properties" to find out how this works.) (Goodstein, 2004, 105-109)    Also check this out:  http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fa...
IwXuWX05aa	A Small Snip of Time    It seemed forever to take them to get there. "Hardly worth the trip," she thought sourly as they sat parked in traffic on the stretch she'd come  to call Highway to Hell, which was only a heartbeat away from its cousin, Gypsy Road (5, 8).  She distinguished between them.  Highway to Hell was filled with anger while Gypsy Road was overflowing with tourists.  Both had a nasty calvacade of cars, accidents, people honking, others frowning, many fighting.  Road rage at its best.      She glanced over at him as he sat there calmly tapping the steering wheel.  "Is this love?" she sighed to herself.(4)  "If it is, Love Bites.(7)  18 & Life is what I got when I met him.(6)   Don't even know my crime, but I'm doing the time."  She knew it wasn't right; it wasn't his fault.   But sometimes she just longed to be free again.  It was this gnawing feeling that whispered in her ear and tugged on her arm, More than Words.(10)    Just then a  well-manicured old car swerved unexpectedly into the small space ahead of them.  "Yeah, we're sure Livin' On a Prayer now," she said aloud.(2)  "That old nut trying to Jump over everyone.(3)  Look at him.   Typical senior.  Hurry up and slow down.  Where does he think it gets him?"  You could hear the annoyance in her tone.  She flipped on the radio.  Satellite was good sometimes to take the edge off the trip. She pressed the button to Octane.  It had the best music.    A knock on the window and she looked up.  A shabbily dressed, filthy looking middle-aged  man stood there.  They didn't roll down the windows.  Once Bitten, Twice Shy...you know?(9) But she didn't want to think about what her kindness had resulted in that last time.  Just another step along the way to her current state of heartlessness.    Traffic started to move.  But it was touch and go all the way.  Took them nearly two hours.  What can you expect?  It was a typical Manic Monday. (Bonus)  She closed her eyes for what seemed like only a few minutes.  Next thing she knew they parking in the garage on Wall Street.  "Ahhhhh," she let out a soft sound, still tired.

It was just another MANIC MONDAY on our 2 month overseas trip.  "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE everyone." said our tour guide. He was quite a tall man, with what seemed to be LOVE BITES all over his neck... although he assured us they were just from the mosquitoes.  He wasn't exactly a pleasant person, just the sight of him made me want to JUMP out of the bus onto "GYPSY ROAD" as the man so commonly referred to it as... a more suitable name would be the HIGHWAY TO HELL. The only thing preventing me from doing so was the good looking guy sitting next to the window.. IS THIS LOVE?  ______________________________________...    To be continued... =P

4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	It has nothing to do with being lazy WC. Those who do this are either Jewish or have some type of connection with Judaism. By writing G-d, they are showing reverence and respect. It really is that simple.    That is correct, it is a long standing Jewish tradition to not say or write God's name out of reverence and respect. I don't necessarily agree with it but I do appreciate why they do it. (((WC)))|`|uFAoq4idaa	This is a sign of respect by the Jews. They do not want that the name of God to be thrown away. Example when you write the name God and later on you have to throw away the paper where you have written the word that would be disrespectful to them. So they write G-d in order not to destroy the name of God. Once the word God is written this should not be erased or being destroyed.|`|e89264f656ff84ffb5f18adc3f39e5e8aa	The Jewish people will not say His name or write it, as they believe mankind is not worthy to speak it. To get around it, while writing, they leave out the 'o'.|`|AA11124121	Actually, that is not God's name, it is a title, and it is generic.  Do we repect our God by calling Him a generic g-d??    a god is a god is a god. God is YHWH, Yahweh, or Jehovah..
02hcNMxKaa	That's a tricky one!  My first instinct is to say that it's a simile because it uses the word "like" (the traditional definition of a simile is a comparison that uses "like" or "as")... but then again, a simile would say that the SUBJECT of the sentence is like something, which is not the case here.  I'm almost inclined to say that the answer is neither!    If I were to change the sentence into something that's DEFINITELY a simile, I might say:  "The ball was like a creature with eyes."  (The metaphor version of that sentence would be "The ball was a creature with eyes.")  Granted, these are both kind of lame sentences, but they fit the definitions. :)

Be prepared esp. if you are going to teach kids because they ask alot and know alot too.  course adults esp the elder know the bible pretty good too!     Be patient ,kind and listen and be ready with answers...    Let me knwo if their is anything else that i may help you with!     God bless you for wanting to reach out and teach others about Christ!

Meaning every time you read, ask your self "so what".|`|aZWxKhbhaa	First of all keep yourself organized   Be upto date with what due when, keep ALL your notes/study guides/work-sheets/homework/quizzes because most your quizzes & tests will be from those.  Read from the textbook chapters thoroughly even tho your teacher hasn't required you to! Make sure you're able to answer the questions at the end of the chapter.  Give extra effort to this class. Keep it your top priority.    finally, get extra help if you need to.    oh and be friends with all the smart kids from the class. :)  you should be set.|`|K64Oi3hwaa	Well...I am taking AP Government/Politics next year...

inZ9CWBiaa	I think students should be given good assignments that provide them opportunities to discover the intended learning. How many that would be is less important. Some students might need one learning experience to understand the skill or information, for other students they might need to encounter the learning in three or more different ways. Assignments should be designed to cater to different learning styles so that they have the opportunity to learn in different ways.|`|RzbRRUOdaa	Yes, assignments teach students to be industrious.  They make them study and do their homework.    This is not to make life difficult for students.  It is to prepare them for real life when there are no shortcuts to real and actual assignments.    Doing assignments is more than simply accumulating knowledge.  It is character building.    That's my opinion based on experience and based on the lives of people I know.|`|gjDcdTcDaa	Nope!My teacher gives me 3 or 2 assignment's  a day!On the weekend he gives us like 5!And on vacations like presidents week he will give us like 17 pages!Dont be to tough !

I'm a 10th grader in Beverly Hills High School, California    And right now I'm taking AP Biology. And just flunked...    I'll be honest with you. I didn't try my hardest in the beginning of the semester, and I could've done better.    Positives: It's an extra point on your GPA so for example lets say you get a C for AP English its like getting a B in Regular English.  Also, colleges and universities ALWAYS look at the kids with AP Classes before the Regular Class kids. Its a good experience and it is very challenging and good for your brain xD. Plus you learn things more detailed than other kids.    Negatives: It's very hard unless you're naturaully a genius. It requires a lot of time and effort. Plus you have to practice and study alot and have good studying skills. I know because I didn't have good studying skills    Thats why I failed =(    So think about it. But I really recommend you taking it. It's really good for you.    Hope my answer helped you!    -Kevin

This prodigy appeared for Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Each of the tests were of 800 marks and Lokesh got 100% in all the papers.    Lokesh also got good marks in Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), scoring 263. SAT exam is under-taken by students seeking admission to under-graduate programmes.    TOEFL, of course, is a must for anybody going abroad for studies.SAT is divided into two parts. SAT-I consists of Mathematics level-I, verbal English and Written English. Lokesh scored 610/800 in this section.    In Mathematics he got full 800 marks. SAT-II consists of subjects in which the candidate is seeking admission.  For computer science, Lokesh had to appear in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics level-II. It was here that he scored 2400/2400.    Seeking admission in the computer engineering programme, Lokesh has already got offers from Purdue University, University of Southern California, University of Wisconsin, Madison and is wait-listed in the University of Michigan.    Lokesh's father, Inder Kumar Batra, is a Captain in the Merchant Navy. He is employed with Varun Shipping Limited, Mumbai. Lokesh's mother, Anupama, is a home-maker.    "Though Lokesh was disheartened when he did not get through Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford University, he felt better after a polite letter from them stated that they have an elaborate criteria which also includes 10+2 marks. Earlier he was feeling discriminated against,"Inder Batra informed TOI.    Though Lokesh had got 84% in ICSE and 83% in ISC, these fall a little short of the criteria employed by MIT and Stanford.    These Ivy League universities also look into the extra-curicular activities of the candidate. MIT is rated as the best university for computer engineering while Stanford stands second.    Lokesh is fond of trekking and, of course, computer programming. At present he is in New Delhi to appear for AIEEE and will fly off to Purdue - the university whose offer for admission has got his nod.    And who knows, he may finally end up at MIT as a transfer case after performing brilliantly in Purdue.
ALFMVEPKaa	ya , you are right , the undergrad education is very expensive in america , and now with the recession and all they have cut heavily on scholarships , ok now here are some pointers  1) apply for a loan ( make sure you keep your parents in the loop)  2) you can work on campus there to cover your living expenses  3) search for indian groups based in the us on the net , get in contact with them , they can give you pointers on what 2 do.  4) get i touch with relatives abroad , if u cn crash at their place , you save on living charges

yGOmMQP7aa	About a week after you submit your fafsa, you will get an SAR from the Department of Education.  You will get this either by mail or email.  However, it will not give you any amounts, it will just instruct you to contact your school.  Your school always has additional paperwork for you to fill out and turn into them to get all the info needed to get your aid determined.    After your "financial aid file" is complete (you turn in all your paperwork) at your COLLEGE they will issue you an award letter.  This letter will detail the types of financial aid (grants, loans, work study) you are being offered.  Usually you are instructed to either "Accept" or "Decline" each line item on your award.      Applying for fin aid is a process that takes many weeks, sometimes months.  Be sure you have applied to the college and been accepted.  Most schools won't send award letters to students who haven't been admitted/accepted yet.  Also, if you are considering several schools, it is perfectly acceptable to turn in fin aid paperwork to several and choose your school based on your award letter amounts and how much you will have to pay to each school.|`|5c70e4a7234f0be8642df55ef4a96e46aa	Usually after 2 - 3 days (assuming you provided your email)  If you did not give them your email it will take about two weeks until you get the mail  You should log into you FAFSA account and see the summary.    Also, tThere will be given the EFC code (or something like that)    They say EFC does not represent any money whatsoever. However, the number you will see is the yearly amount in dollars your family can give you for education. It's totally ridicolous. In my school, one girl got a 7, while my friend got 50,000...|`|cWP73qEsaa	you will receive a letter via mail a few weeks after you fill out the fafsa and it will tell you if u qualify and the amount.

No, sorry, no grants for past balances.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Well, you shouldn't have gone to University, without some way to pay the bills.  Surely there is some way to get a retroactive student loan...or a personal loan from the bank might work.    Let me be sure I am straight, here.  You went to school, thinking you were going to pay as you go?  And you found out that you couldn't, yet didn't get financial aid while you were still a student?  WHY would you do it that way???      Try to contact their student aid/financial aid, and if that doesn't get you what you want, go to the bank and get a proper loan.
tQsxsuNPaa	Ummmm.  Yeah.  It's called FRAUD, and it's illegal.  And they'll catch you, because financial aid people CHECK that stuff!     It is illegal, even if your job is under-the-table, which, btw, is ALSO illegal.|`|20NZn1YZaa	Um yeah. They will look at your financial records through your social security number.

It's a prudish way to say "colder than the Devil" (or, "colder than Hell") without actually saying "Devil" or "Hell".|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	In 1842, Charles Dickens visited America. His reception was somewhat colder than that which usually greeted him  already a successful author in both Britain and the U.S. This lack of enthusiasm from the Americans was partly due to his criticism of the pirating of English books in that country and partly due to his outspoken distaste for the custom of slavery in the southern states. He wrote in the preface to American Notes, "Prejudiced I am not, and never have been, otherwise than in favour of the United States. I have many friends in America. I feel a grateful interest in the country. I hope and believe it will successfully work out a problem of the highest importance in the whole human race. To represent me as viewing America with ill nature, coldness or animosity is merely to do a very foolish thing, which is always a very easy one!" Despite this placatory tone, one American reviewer spoke thus of American Notes: "The most trashy .the most contemptible. the essence of balderdash, reduced to the last drop of silliness and inanity."
vwcDdNfcaa	ok listen   I attend connections academy(www.connectionsacademy.com)   for each class i have a daily lesson it is about average 5 pages,   you read it then answer answere anywhere from 3-10 questions on  what you read and it is automaticly graded (called a quick check)  at the end of each lesson there is a test going over everything you  learned from the lessons usally 9 lessons in a unit if it is multi choice  the comp grades it and you get it back within 3 seconds but if it also  has problems that you need to write it waits until the comp grades it  for example this is one of my ungraded drivers ed test "35 out of 35   correct with 5 questions worth 25 points not yet graded" connections  academy also comes with a grade book you can check your grades   at any time. it list all your classes then you click which class you'd  like and it shows you all you've done for that class so far with the grade  next to them. you contact your teachers via e-mail, they call it webmail  or via phone you attend live lessons where it is a webcam thingy they  show you a powerpoint for that lesson and they use mic to answe Q's  they are known as a public cyber high school so all colleges accept  which is hard to find when doing schooling online. they told me when i  want to transfer back into a local school all i have to do is tell them   they will discharge me and i just enroll back into a local school  depending on the local school i may or may not have to take a test to  see what grade i should belong. but since ive been in CA i went from   D's and F's to A' and B's I wouldnt switch for the world and they also   do feild trips so other kids that attend the school can interact its amazing.  if you would like to know more or have any other options please feel   free to e-mail me at sammieee_x3@yahoo.com|`|VG4gKiggaa	Depends on where you live.

Some of us don't bother with tests at all...we know when our kids have mastered a subject.    All the best.|`|LisP31O8aa	Yes, but it's a poor way to study and learn and a huge waste of time for every body.  WE used teachers editions and would answer the chapter reviews and quizzes, then check ourselves for the answers and go back to study what the book wanted from us - the kids did it all, read, do the reviews, ck the answers and find the correct ones in the book if they didn't have it already, so, in effect they were studying the material over 3 times and knew it very well when we went on.  Plus,it was fun to see what you did and cheating on your self is stupid that no one even though to do it.   We left public school because we didn't agree with how and what was being taught ( not taught is more like it) and how it was all about manipulating the kids to get grades, not about learning and education, so why in the world would we try to do the same as what we don't agree with in public schools ?    It didn't make sense to give grades either to our kids, for what ?  or a report card, for what ?  it seemed a total waste of time to me.  WE read and studied and discussed items of interest, we watched educational DVDs and went to museums and theater, to the Ballet four times a year plus the Nutcracker, we took various music lessons, dance, singing, and  ocean lifeguard rescue , read books together out loud and looked up vocabulary that no body knew.  It was a wonderful time for our family and a wonderful experience.  Cooking and baking were lessons in math and fractions, and no body minded.  We got great magnifying glasses and went outside - wow.  We got microscopes and took water home from the pond, from the beach, again wow.     As far as I 'm concerned, my kids all got straight   A + on everything.  They passed college entrance exams , two are in college now, another has his 2 nd year in avionics and in one more year he'll have his FAA  license for Avionics, he also is taking a computer tech class, another is in the Peace Corps, one is in the Army BAnd, he auditioned and made it into the School of Music so he's living happily ever after on a lifetime long gig with his favorite instrument, Another daughter is a psychology major at our local college -   Learning is an enjoyment and delightful continual ssurpriseof knowledge - it's not grades until you get to college if that's the way you go and grades will not be a problem if you have learned excellence in study for the sake of learning.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	well in my homeschooling no. we get shipped all of our work in the mail for free|`|mGEwdQyvaa	Of course.

I'm French so for me it comes naturally and I can speak the language perfectly without asking myself how I can do that.    The good news for you is that genders are only important at school, when you learn the language because your teacher needs a point of reference in order to grade you. In real life, foreigners with heavy accents and completely oblivious of gender rules...are in fact talking in an extremelly sexy way.    So, instead of saying le, la or les, just say a sound that sounds like all three together and use masculine adjectives instead of feminine ones, or vice-versa....and you will sound extremelly cute.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	Feminine usually ends in an "e".|`|45996ea7fe5211219390ba08f8da17c5aa	I'm in my second year of French, and I've learned that there is pretty much no way to tell just from the name.

EjvCXSLxaa	It is the branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the origins, distribution, technology, religion, language, and social structure of the ethnic, racial, and/or national divisions of humanity.    Among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of human history, and the formulation of cultural invariants, such as the alleged incest taboo and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "human nature", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers (Hegel, Marx, structuralism, etc.). In some parts of the world ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine, with cultural anthropology becoming dominant especially in the United States, and social anthropology in Great Britain. The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.

If you don't have an author, make the title of the web page the main entry and move the date after it, as shown at the URL below.    If the web site is quoting from another source, have an entry in the bibliography at the end for the web site as stated above (not the one that it is quoting).

yGOmMQP7aa	Your FAFSA application goes to the US Department of Education.  After it's calculated, the information is sent to your school.    You submit your fafsa as soon as possible because applying for financial aid is a PROCESS that takes weeks, sometimes months!  Better have an early application deadline than have you start school with no money for books or gas money.  It may seem inconvenient now, but not near as bad as starting college with no planning and no money.    The financial aid you get comes from the various partners, (banks for loans, the Dept of Education for federal grants like Pell and FSEOG and your state for state grants) and is send directly to your school and an account is created to help you pay for your tuition and books and fees and if applicable your dorm and meal plan.      If, after all your tuition and other fees are paid, you have any  money left over, the SCHOOL will issue you a check for the amount left over.  Some people don't have any money left over.  Some have extra money but not everyone gets it free.  Most financial aid awarded by colleges are LOANS that have to be paid back.    Read this book cover to cover and it will give an excellent detailed process.  Look for the flow chart in the beginning of the book.
p2YwZuD5aa	What do you want to ask?|`|RNG1cT8saa	well im more likely not to start throwing things and kicking everything, heat makes ppl angry - so the answer is yes
7yJnFQsNaa	I would definitely speak first! When you go first you don't have to sit through a whole class period feeling nervous. The longer you wait, the more nervous you'll get. Also, when you go first, it's the best speech because no one is comparing you to people who went before you!|`|Lblevf5Zaa	first.  Because if someone is better than you you are going to panic and if they are worst than u you will panic.  Get it over with.  Go first and leave the panicking for the other folks.|`|GJjpXeqyaa	Dont go first but not last either. Somewhere in between. So that you can get a taste of the standards.
ORonhAuvaa	It depends at which level you would like to work. If you want to be a classroom assistant, then you will need to have two years of general education at the community college level. However, since states differ, check with you local school district.    To be a teacher, you will need to attend a four year college or university that has a degree in special education. It will take about five years of full time attendance. You usually will end up with a master's degree.    If you don't have the money for college, check out your future college's financial aide office. The Pell Grant is available to finance college.    As a college graduate, you will earn 1 million dollars more than a high school graduate.|`|Lblevf5Zaa	it depends on the school.  ask a adviser from a college.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Patience

Your virtuous nature has allowed me to open up to you.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	The main problem is that it is too long a sentence.    I have never shared personal stories with a random person, especially someone whom I have never met.  As time passed, I realized that you are trustworthy and that is why I opened up.    (Don't know what a "true person" and "true virtues" would be.  Are there "false persons" and "false virtues?")|`|YoZONpxIaa	It sounds good, just a few things you might want to change...    I myself have never shared any personal stories with a random person either, especially if I have never met them. But as time went by I realised that you are a true person **maybe enter in some other nice things in here? eg, you are a lovely and friendly person** with true virtues, and that's what got me to open up.    Hope this helps =)|`|JTJl3oHXaa	You could take out the 'myself' and you could just use it this way:  I revised it...      I have never shared any personal stories with a random person either, no matter if it was someone who I've never met. Although, as time went by, I realized that you are a true person with virtue and that is what got me to open up.

uPalPUjYaa	If I understand the question and your saying that there are a couple of numbers that are a lot bigger or smaller than the rest then I'd say median is probably your best bet.      These outliers will have a big effect on the mean and make it unreliable.  For example if you have 2, 2, 4, 6, 70 then your mean is 16.8 but most of the numbers are much lower than this.  The one outlier 70 is making it much higher and if the 70 is just a fluke then you don't want it to affect your average.      If you use median, the 70 has no more impact on the average than the 2.  If there's only a couple extreme numbers, then these will be canceled out as you move toward the middle number.  The mean would be 4 here, which is more representative of most of the numbers than 16.8.    Mode is usually not a great option when your dealing with numerical data.  Mean and median are almost always more representative of the whole data set unless there is a unusual situation.

LisP31O8aa	First of all, read all the answers to the questions in the Home Schooling section of yahoo answers - there is a treasure of information for you just waiting there.   I have given some quality long answers and so have many others on this.      Our own son was the same, always exhausted and sick from being exhausted and from hating school and the rotten teachers, and more rotten kids.  He is home schooled now and hasn't been sick since we took him out, he uses Florida Virtual School and gets state credit for every class he takes, and they are not a piece of cake but he is learning so much.  He has been constantly surprised about it and often comes to me saying stuff like, ''Mom, they just don't teach this stuff in school,  My friends don't know anything compared to what I'm learning here,''  and so on and so on.  He feels very very good about himself and his life now.  You have to get your parents involved because it's on their authority that you can withdraw from school and register in home school.  Your state I'm sure has a department for that.      Also,  google  Home School Legal Defense and they can tell you what the laws are in your state and help you if you need it.  They can guide your parents.      Besides on line, there are many programs you might want including from The Teaching Company.  They have some great stuff on everything, dvd and audio also.  WE used to use auto reverse and play tapes when the kids went to sleep and they loved it, easy way to learn.     You can revise your life and revitalize your brain and re- invent yourself if you want to and not be a sheep following sheep, like saying'' like'' when it's not appropiate and sounds so childish.  If you want to do better and succeed, then you will, and if you don't care, then it doesn't matter anyway.    Honestly, good luck to you.  You have to be pretty smart or you wouldn't be thinking 'home school'.|`|FMvkg2Nyaa	Try one of the free online homeschool options...K12, Connections Academy or Kaplan. http://takecontrolofyoureducation.blogsp...  They assign you a credentialed teacher to guide you through the process and you work on your school work at home independently. It sounds like it might be a good option for you.     Here's an article about talking to your parents about homeschooling.. http://virtualonlineschool.blogspot.com/    Best of Luck!  Jana  http://www.purehomeschooling.com/|`|ub23m7Praa	I don't know if it is in your area, but I did this thing called the Internet Academy. Google that. Other than that I have no idea.     Hope this helps.
ySjnEla9aa	Put urself in the yellow pages and other books...start with some people that u know and tell them to spread it to their friends    start between 11-16...then progress because teaching is harder than it seems.  either...most people usually go to the child's home but others do it in their own house...whatever is more convenient for you.    Religious Studies, Sociology to high levels...u could always tutor people in the gcse's that u took    good luck!|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	And what do you know about teaching?    Have you had a CRB check?    You could potentially tutor in Sociology and RS A level. English and various social sciences at GCSE.    A rule of thumb is that you should have one qualification higher than the one you teach.    Not wanting to put a downer on this but most parents want tutoring in maths, science and English in that order.    Look up a few tutoring sites and see what other tutors are offering and what they charge. 15-25 per hour is quite standard, but if I was a parent would I choose you to tutor my child or someone with 20 years teaching experience and a teaching qualification?|`|XPbz5dOBaa	This site is an absolute must for you and will give you all your answers.|`|BXALhzvtaa	Register with http://beanbaglearning.com/ it's free.   What to charge, well that's up to you. If you were doing it full time to make a living you'd need to charge 20-40 per hour but if it's for extra cash while you're a student you could charge a lower rate. In fact you probably ought to keep your rate down since you are a student rather than a qualified professional.  Age groups? What age kids do you find you get on well with? Little ones to be honest your core subjects really don't fit well with, people are most likely to be looking for things like Literacy, Maths, Music and Modern Languages.   I would offer to tutor at the children's home unless you are going to be teaching a group of children from different families rather than individuals.   The subjects you teach, well that'll largely be down to the age of the children and what their parents think of your qualifications. Personally as a parent I wouldn't even ask what your GCSEs are in, they're just not rigorous enough to qualify you to teach the subjects. As and ***, I might think you'd be OK for Primary level.|`|735KiHn2aa	I have tutored for several years now. What I usually do at the beginning of each school year is send out a letter with a flyer to all the private schools in our area. I also post my flyers on bulletin boards at the local colleges and universities. As far as rates, if you are tutoring regular level courses for school-age children, I would charge anywhere from $25-40 per hour, depending on where you live, etc... If you are tutoring upper level, AP, or college level courses, then you can charge at the higher end of the scale. It helps to have a degree in what you are tutoring, as you can charge more, but its not required. Finally, you will have to decide where to tutor. I have tutored at my home (always make sure the parent stays!), at the local public library, and at the child's home.

MINy26pjaa	A verb is in the subjunctive mood when it expresses a condition which is doubtful or not factual. It is most often found in a clause beginning with the word if. It is also found in clauses following a verb that expresses a doubt, a wish, regret, request, demand, or proposal.     These are verbs typically followed by clauses that take the subjunctive:     ask, demand, determine, insist, move, order, pray, prefer, recommend, regret, request, require, suggest, and wish.     In English there is no difference between the subjunctive and normal, or indicative, form of the verb except for the present tense third person singular and for the verb to be.     The subjunctive for the present tense third person singular drops the -s or -es so that it looks and sounds like the present tense for everything else.     The forms:    (If she were coming, she would be here by now. I insist that the chairman resign! Their main demand was that the lawsuit be dropped.)     These sentences all contain verbs in the subjunctive mood, which is used chiefly to express the speakers attitude about the likelihood or factuality of a given situation. If the verbs were in the indicative mood, we would expect she was coming in the first sentence, the chairman resigns in the second, and the lawsuit is dropped in the third.|`|22oMednCaa	The subjunctive is a mood-- not a tense. It's really hard to explain. See the link. Here's an example that doesn't use "to be":    To have:  "If you HAD just stayed out of it, you wouldn't be in this mess."

QmwYOQuDaa	Because interior students have to do significantly less learning than architectural students in the profession.  Interior designers are not burdened by different construction assemblies that architects are faced with.  Architectural students are not exposed to detailing, coordination with consultants, field and contract administration.  There is a whole new world of learning for architectural students once they hit the profession while most interior designers can hit the ground running.  So the productivity of an architectural intern is handicapped by their learning curve.  The employer must set up a salary that would still make it profitable for the company.

jKdVtDx7aa	Audie Murphy WW2    Alvin York  WW1- Audie L. Murphy rose to national fame as the most decorated U.S. combat soldier of World War II. Among his 33 awards and decorations was the Medal of Honor, the highest military award for bravery that can be given to any individual in the United States of America.  He also received every decoration for valor that his country had to offer, some of them more than once, including 5 decorations by France and Belgium. Credited with either killing over 240 of the enemy while wounding and capturing many others, he became a legend within the 3rd Infantry Division.       York, Alvin C., Sergeant. (1887-1964).    Alvin Cullum York was born on December 13, 1887 at Pall Mall, Fentress County, Tenessee, the third of eleven children of William and Mary Brooks York. The tall, gangly red-headed lad was typical of rural American youth of the turn of the century, working hard and playing hard. Growing up in the mountains, Alvin, like most of his contemporaries, lived by his rifle. To young Alvin, the rifle was not a weapon to be used in a fight, but a tool to put meat on the table. He became an expert marksman, and won many a county turkey-shoot. His skill with the rifle was to play a major role in his fame.    Alvin's father died in 1911, leaving Alvin the oldest son at home to help his mother raise a large family. The young man became a hard-drinking, gambling roughneck, until he met Gracie Williams in about 1915. Due mostly to Gracie's influence, he became a member (and soon an elder) of the strict pacifist Church of Christ in Christian Union. Just as Alvin was beginning to feel he had a grip on life, his draft notice arrived. On November 15, 1917, he reported for military duty at Camp Gordon, Georgia.    His last days as a civilian were a difficult ones for Alvin. The frank mountain man faced a dilemma: his religion told him not to go to war, and his patriotism told him he should. After two days and a night spent in prayer on a mountainside, York resolved to go.    York arrived in the front lines in France on June 27, 1918, but his appointment with destiny came on October 8, 1918, in the Argonne forest. York, by then a Corporal, was ordered to take his squad on a surprise attack against an emplacement of German machine guns. They surprised a group of 15 - 20 Germans, including a Major, and took them prisoners without a shot. But the Major called out in German, and suddenly York's squad was under fire from a ridge less than 30 yards away. With all but two of his squad killed, York "exchanged shots" with the machine gunners. York wrote in his diary: "There were over 30 of them in continuous action and all I could do was touch the Germans off as fast as I could. I was sharpshooting. I don't think I missed a shot. It was no time to miss." Suddenly, a German Lieutenant and five soldiers jumped from a trench and charged him with fixed bayonets, York took cool aim and shot the last man first, then the man next farthest away, and so on, until all six had fallen.    Finally, the German Major offered to surrender his entire command, if York would "just stop shooting." Upon return to Allied lines, it was determined that York had taken 132 prisoners. The next morning, 28 dead Germans were found at the scene of the fight: the same number of shots York said that he fired. 35 German machine guns and assorted small arms and ammunition were also captured. Returning to the scene of his "triumph," York prayed for those who had died, German and American alike. For his exploits, York was awarded The Medal of Honor, as well as the the French Croix de Guerre, the Italian Croce de Guera, and the American Distinguished Service Cross. He was also promoted to the rank of Sergeant.    After the War, Sgt. York returned to his Tennessee mountains and his beloved Gracie. They married on June 7, 1919, a week and a day after Alvin's return. He determined that it was his mission in life to bring education to his native valley, and set about to raise the money to build a high school (now the Alvin C. York Technical Institute) and a Bible school. Alvin and Gracie raised 7 children. For 35 years, he hunted, he farmed, he did some blacksmithing, and he preached. In 1954, Alvin York suffered a devastating cerebral hemorrhage, and was an invalid for the last ten years of his life.    Sgt. Alvin C. York died at the Veterans Hospital in Nashville on September 2, 1964, at the age of 76. He is buried in the family plot in the Wolf River Cemetary in Pall Mall, Tennessee.|`|e9ARhomFaa	the most standout soldier in australian history would have to be John Simpson Kirkpatrick or most commonly known as "simpson and his donkey."

Hinton,  The Outsiders. This poem has two meanings, the first about good things never last forever and the second about youth and innocence. Robert Frosts poem relates to the novel, the Outsiders in many ways.    The first meaning is that good things do not last. That life may seem perfect when everything is going right, but this will not stay forever. Everything living is beautiful and every beautiful thing will eventually die. Robert Frost is saying good things will never stay forever. Many times in a persons life there will unhappiness and sorrow, the good times will end. Even though the great times come to an end, they will be followed by more and more great times. It is just like life. Life begins through beautiful babies, but sadly, in many years the baby will die. But, since good times will come again, a new beautiful baby will be born. It also means that all things are going to change eventually, like people, seasons and nature.    Gold in the poem represents youth. Line one, Natures first green is gold, indicates natures first green is youth because every living thing begins with youth. Line two, Her hardest hue to hold, represents that youth is very hard to keep because they get older in age. In line three, the poem says, Her early leafs a flower, which defines youth as innocent, and beautiful like a flower. Line four, But only so an hour means that the young child will grow older and no longer be innocent for it will mature and begin to do wrong things. In line five, Then leaf subsides to leaf symbolizes the child becoming an adult and loosing its innocence and childhood. So Eden sank to grief, states that the person realizes that they are no longer a child and that they must face the world all on their own. So dawn goes down to day, means the childhood of the person is finished and that it will never return. The last line, Nothing gold can stay states that people change and youth will not stay forever.    The characters lives in the Outsiders relate to the lines in the poem, greatly. At first Johnnys life was carefree and happy until the night he was beat up. That night changed him, it lost his innocence, like the poem describes. Ponyboys life was also joyous before he experience Johnny kill the Soc, Bob. After these two events happened both boys were no longer the same. The events had matured them and they were not children anymore. The poem describes nothing good lasting, well Johnnys life was slightly good and his life did not last, neither did Dallys life.    Nothing Gold Can Stay is a deep poem and has many reflective meanings. Johnny and Ponyboy in the novel can relate to and tried to understand this poem. To me there are a few meanings about life and innocence.

The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places    Those who have a great passion courage( to do something) bravery, and strength will ultimately find their limits.  Some will overcome them.    But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially    As for the good, gentle and very brave, the world does not operate on what a person's moral values are.  It is like a mousetrap, that waits for it's prey.  The trap doesn't care if the mouse is good or kind.     If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry."   In the end death waits for everyone.
VlBncwFDaa	The problem of hearing each word in head is called subvocalization. This is also the major problem of most people when concerned about reading.    How I start to get rid of the problem, is by repeating some little sound with no meaning, like repeating YES, a, e, i, o, u, during reading, just make my brain unable to vocalize the words I read. It needs time and practice. When start trying, you may not understand well on you read initially (comprehension drop), but will get better and better through practice. You will not need to give the meaningless sound after practice too, eventually.    You need practice. Some teaching aid with speed reading concepts and training can help you a lot for sure.

Apply to college and then see what kind of a financial aid package the college will give you before giving up.    If even with that, you come up short, there are several options.  The first would be to spend a couple of years at a community college.  If you and your parents can't even afford that, you should be eligible for government grants to pay for your education.  Secondly, you could live at home and work, going to school part-time rather than full-time.

Don't depend on the GED class to teach you; take some responsibility for your life and your own success and do it yourself. Find a tutor (maybe one of the GED instructors) to help you. Make it a priority.    I'm in a hiring position at my company; if you can't at least conquer the GED I wouldn't even hire you for janitor.

So students weighing 100 pounds (45 kilograms) should not carry more than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kilograms) in their packs."    because this can affect posture and bad posture leads to back pain.    anywayz, it can be an excuse... especially if it is seriously painful and brings serious discomfort.    hope u'll feel well soon... =-)|`|6JJUGs7faa	I had that same problem and i still do.

bwx3epFdaa	The index of average daily wages means it was the typically daily earnings for people that year. If a work week was 9.9 hours and the earnings were 169.2, then the average earnings for industrial workers was 17.09 dollars an hour. The doc. B cartoon is saying how labor unions and movements are destroying the American way of economy (capitalism) because their views were leaning towards the socialist (communist) side because of their want for equal pay and their demand to take power away from the companies and bargain collectively as a unit of workers. Doc. F is saying that there are too many forces at work when America was constructing its labor policy and they all played a part in shaping it yet their views did not coincide. Therefore the result is a bad blend that nobody is really happy with.

She works on her stuff from the time she wakes up until she goes to bed and is usually behind.

She even works in the car as we travel from one place to another.     If you are looking at teaching pre-school, then the paper work is probably much less.  Anything higher,  and your teaching becomes your lifestyle.  If you really want to do it, take the plunge.  You won't regret it.  If you're simply unhappy or unsuited for the job you are currently in, you might want to spend some more time exploring options.

Fex51ntIaa	Better how?     They tend to instill an unjustified sense of confidence and entitlement in their pupils and turn others into jibbering wrecks. There can be a lot of bullying and you have no escape back to your family support. That said, they can offer a huge range of activities that you won't get at state school because they have more money.    I used to work with a two guys who went to two different boarding schools. One now has real issues with the fact he never saw his Dad during those years and he acts in a way befitting with a school with a reputation for brutality such as his (i.e. he is a complete c*nt). The other guy totally loved his school. He made good friends and got to do all sorts of things he would never have been able to do in state school.

I choose plain school..|`|XBJVU0Gtaa	I'm going to generalize to answer this.  Of course, there are many exceptions to these broad generalizations.    For the students attending boarding school vs. their local public, boarding school is the better choice. Believe me that their parents would not pay the high tuition fees if they did not think it was the right place for their children. Even with financial aid, sacrifices must be made.  Also believe me that most parents want what is best for their children.      Does this make boarding schools better than "plain" school?  This is just so broad a question that it really cannot be generalized.  There are so many different types of boarding schools and "plain" schools all over the US and all over the world.  It has to be judged on an individual case with the specific possibilities for that case.

LwywrSRkaa	Hi yes I know revision is boring. But you should make it fun so you can actually do it. =) You will have to get your head down and have the possible rewards in mind that always helps me. And for feeling nervous in exams, practice papers are the key to being confident in the real exam. It is okay to feel nervous but if you practice it home it will make you less nervous because you know what you can expect. When I had my first ever proper exam I was sooo nervous now I never feel nervous anymore. And after an exam don't discuss any answers because it might make you feel down if you had something wrong according to someone who might be wrong too!    Okay so to start of you could make a revision schedule. Whatever you make don't plan it for a long period of time but perhaps for a week. Some people find it's better to concentrate on one subject and others find it's better to do different ones so they don't get bored. You should do about 10-30 minutes a session (and then change the subject for the next session) and then take a break. You should at least spend 2/3 hours a day. Leave one day to give yourself a rest though. Prepare beforehand make check lists of things you already know and things you don't, or what you need help at  and so on.    Switch of everything that can distract you (like music, the computer etc.). Also find a place that's comfy for you, and not a boring old study room where you can't concentrate! Do something where you can work properly.    You can break stuff down into 10, 20 or 30 minutes and swap it between different subjects. If you are somebody who gets distracted easily, strictly do 10 minute sessions! & If you feel  brave you can do longer than that. Sometimes I can work for an hour non-stop!    When you make a revision timetable don't make it too hard either cos you won't stick to it. Make it nice and simple so you can stick to it then as you feel more comfortable with those you can make it harder.    You also need to find your own revision methods, I like making notes, doing podcasts, posters, cards etc. find what works best for you. Make it look interesting though not boring  but colourful and attractive so you will look at it. Ask friends or family to test you as well.    Also when you go home from school you can note down what you have done and try making useful notes during lesson times. Just pay attention a lot and ask if you don't understand  things.    To remember things try sticking posters and things like that up your wall or places where you go past a lot at home. There is this story technique as well and basically if you for example need to know the reactivity of metals you will have to write them down first and next to it write a familiar word. Then you could make a story with the familiar words and you could remember it that way.    If you don't like revising from books etc. you can go on things like BBC Bitesize, or Samlearning and loads of other revision websites. BBC has a lot of podcasts as well.    Don't leave revision too late though or else you might regret it. You would be like I wish I had done better than and trust me you don't want to be retaking exams and so on it will be  too much!    Of course don't do it excessively have fun now and then as well. Little treats and rewards help as well. ;) Good luck! =)|`|8zujEO9taa	Just study in 10 minute blocks. Set yourself little goals like "I will read this chapter and then go for a walk" or something.  As you achieve each goal, you will feel a bit better and a little bit more confident.  As for the nerves, just tell yourself you know the answers, if you've studied them, you will know them :)  Good luck
9ko5WUFkaa	No - it's generally not acceptable to use acronyms (using the initials of words in place of the words) like this in a professional document.  It's just lazy and is assuming that the person reading it will know what you are referring to.  You're better off not doing it.|`|rjac15O0aa	Use moniker means the same thing.|`|cEa8TTenaa	Professional has nothing to do with it - you mean formal or academic.  Aka (also known as) is now very widely used in modern literature. You will see it in some books, so it's not out of the ordinary. You will find 'okay' in books - that's an abbreviation too. It's become an accepted word.    Look in your dictionary. If you find aka listed as a real word, you can use it, and you can use the dictionary as evidence if your teacher points it out.    If you do not find it, use 'also known as' or 'whose alias is', which are both acceptable.    I have found it in the Oxford dictionary, but it does say abbreviation. Still, it's there.     To help you decide - would you write TV rather than television? Same question... see what I mean?  If you would use TV, then you can use aka.    Good luck.|`|TWKIuTEyaa	No contractions, slang or informalities are acceptable in formal written work (such as schoolwork).

ca9ec85e315fc596d7387fa0798c565daa	A function: one element of x is mapped into exactly one element of y.  A relation: one element of x can be mapped into more than one elements of y.    A graph is a relation when an x element has two or more mappings in the element of y. For example y= square root of x and y=  square root of x. It is a relation because there could be 2 values of y in one value of x, for x=1, y=1 and minus 1.    A graph is a function when you can only find one value of y for a particular value of x. For instance, the graph y=x+3. For x=2, y is 5 and only 5. And for all values of x should be the same (only one value of y).|`|FBwK9s7Baa	A relation is just a set of ordered pairs. There is absolutely nothing special at all about the numbers that are in a relation. In other words, any bunch of numbers is a relation so long as these numbers come in pairs. Functions are a special kind of relation . In mathematics, what distinguishes a function from a relation is that each x value in a function has one and only ONE y-value.

fFmRN2c2aa	the other guy said it all...|`|XVYRUzkEaa	THE CHAMP is a cheat.   Check out his profile|`|CO6RyQlkaa	How to prepare for the IIT-JEE     There is no unique way of preparing for the IIT-JEE. What is good for one need not be so for another. Clearing the JEE is a project and as such needs to be planned for and managed properly.     It is said that a battle is not as much won in the field as while planning and strategising for it. The same is true in the case of the JEE. One is not likely to make significant headway if one goes headlong without a coherent plan while preparing for it. One needs to make a sound strategy for clearing the JEE. While some of the elements of such a strategy are common and equally applicable to all aspirants, there are others entirely dependent on the individual.     Believe in yourself     The first step is to start with the right frame of mind. A positive attitude is needed to last through the long drawn process. It will require sustenance of tempo for months together. Many may feel like quitting, but what is going to finally win the race is the belief that one can do it!     Know your strengths and weaknesses     This point cannot be over-emphasised. While you must believe that you can do it, you must also have a very clear idea of where you stand, to begin with. You must know your strengths and weaknesses. These could be anything that has a bearing on your preparation. Some of you, for example, may cover a lot of ground in one sitting, while for some, sustained concentration for more than a specified period at a stretch might prove to be counterproductive.     Some of you may have a natural strength in mathematics, while some may have an aptitude for chemistry or physics. It is important to know these nuances of your strengths and weaknesses. The reason is really simple. To plan and work on a winning strategy, you must know which of your strengths need to be further honed, which of your weaknesses you can live with, and which of the weaknesses you need to work upon so they dont become a handicap.     Plan your schedule     Any successful implementation of a project is the culmination of successfully completing smaller projects and even smaller tasks. Remember that every journey takes its own time. If you wish to reach the destination in time, you need to start right away and plan out the detailswhich milestones do you need to cross, and when, before you finally succeed. Plans need to be worked out at different levels. And for this, you need to set specific time bound targets.     Whatever be the schedule one decides on, it may help to remember the following:   a) Formalise the schedule. Set it in the form of a chart you can see easily anytime.   b) One ought to set realistic targets, without getting influenced by how much ones friends or classmates have covered. There is no point in setting a schedule that needs to be frequently changed.   c) Although it is not advisable to change our schedule every now and then, our schedule has to have some element of flexibility. There is no need to feel unnecessarily guilty if we have not been able to follow the schedule due to some genuine problem. We should remember to cover up the lost ground in the near future.   d) All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Nothing could be truer than this. Please remember that JEE is more about thinking and application than anything else. And to think productively one needs to keep ones mind fresh.     Familiarise yourself with the JEE pattern     Many of us, while preparing for the JEE, tend to lay high emphasis on problem solving and not so much on understanding the subject. Since JEE itself largely consists of numerical problems, this approach leads to a false belief among the studentsthat the more number of problems one solves or goes through, the better are the chances of success at the JEE. While this might be true to a certain extent, solving problems prematurely without adequate grounding of fundamentals is unlikely to meet the final objective. Sometimes we also tend to entangle ourselves with unnecessarily complex problems that have very little relevance to the JEE. Students must study the kinds of questions that have been appearing in the JEE, and convince themselves about the kinds that they need to practice with.     Be rigorous and persistent     It is important to realise that there is no alternative to rigour. This means that we must be thorough with our understanding of concepts. Sometimes while trying to solve a problem, we give up quickly and look at the solution. Many a times we read a topic or see a problem or a solution and think that we have understood it. The words rigour and persistence go hand in hand. Looking at its absolute importance in the context of our preparation, we must try to do the following.       Persist with a problem till you have either found the solution or have come to a dead end. This may take hours, but the learning could be significant.     It may not be wise to skip solving a problem because you think you know how to do it. It may not be quite the same

rJqJFyVdaa	You have two questions here, and I'll answer the second one first, because it's short: the adjectives you use depend largely on the theme of your play (so, if you could mention the theme, then it would be easy to suggest to you), and so also, the adverbs - on the situation, that is.    Now, coming to your first question, the following is what I find necessary for you to have in mind before writing the play;    i)Plan the length of your play (which would be something similar to the length of a simple prose writing, as, short story, novel etc.)    ii)Keep a list of all characters who will ever appear in any part of the play.  I also suggest that you write a couple of paragraphs regarding the character of each person so you can refer to the same, after a certain regular period to check whether the dialogues really reflect the character of the person as you want it to be. This will give a professional touch to your play.  Here is an example of what I just said:  Let us suppose that we have, in our play, the character of an old man, who is to ask a child regarding a certain behaviour his. Compare these:   1.      The old man: Tell me boy, why did you break the glass?  2.      The old man: Tell me MY boy, WHAT MADE YOU BREAK THE     GLASS?    In the above two sentences, sentence 1, suggests that our 'Old man' has a commanding nature, and sentence 2 suggests that he is of the patient and caring sort - and it is the latter that we want.    iii) When you write, use the colloquial language. Don't say ' so, I say, let us...'. Instead, say, ' so, let's...'    iv) Now, since you are writing a Sci-Fi play, I suggest that you include the element of surprise and disbelief in the tone of certain characters (depending upon your play) at the beginning and gradually fade it out.    v) Since you plan to write a radio play, it would be advicable to have less action and more talk that would, in turn, explain your actions.    vi) DO NOT EQUIVOCATE. It will yield devastating results!    Writing, being my hobby, I love to freely give advice to anyone who seeks it. Feel free to contact me at any time, personally, at spacescientist93-queries@yahoo.com    I'll add tips if I find any more.

rNSOSMZlaa	Majors are the main topic that you want to study in college.  For example I majored in Psychology, meaning that after taking core courses that everyone has to take, I decided to focus on Psychology and study that in depth more than the average student does.    Minors are the same thing except you don't have to take as many classes to get a minor in something.  Note that you have to have a Major, minors in a lot of schools are optional.    Undergraduate is the status you are in school, if you haven't attended a  University yet, you will be an undergraduate or "undergrad" and will try to obtain your Baccalaureate degree.    Finally a graduate program verse an undergraduate program, a graduate has already obtained their 4 year (Baccalaureate) degree and has applied to "graduate school" in which they will get a Master's degree.  A Graduate program you have to apply for specially to get admitted and normally one picks a graduate program that is the same as was their major.  So for example I would seek a Master's degree in Psychology (to do this I would need to go into a graduate program).    So if you are applying for a school right now, you can put down a Major if you want, or decide what you want to major in later while you are at school.  And you want to apply as an undergraduate, not a graduate if you have not yet attended and received your Baccalaureate degree.    Hope this helps!    Good luck!|`|rLmDiWhFaa	Each school has its own rules about it. You can compare their rules and students feedback here - careers.scienceontheweb.net

At work if everybody has a networked  computer or mobile you are able to arrange meetings on line and put the details into the attendees diaries, check when people are free to meet, check where they are etc.Within your own diary you can enter personal appointments and block out times you want to keep free. This is much more efficient way of managing time.    The downside is where some co-workers are regularly out and about or work in non-networked situations. They can't instantly access their diaries or make on line amendments. A paper based diary is essential for these.

Every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy animal that lives here can see her, but romeo can't. flies are healthier and more honourable and better suited for romance than romeo. they can take hold of juliets wonderful white handand they can kiss her sweet lips. Even while she remains a pure virgin, she blushes when her lips touch eachother because she thinks it's a sin. But romeo can't kiss her or hold her hand because he's been banished. Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city. Flies are like free men, but I have been banished. And yet you say that exile is not death? Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment? Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment. If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you're my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?

695fc654cdf1a239729e006c9946a7ddaa	First of all you need to speak English all the time if you want to improve your reading and comprehension skills.  Whats your mother tongue?  If it is not English then you need to speak English most of the time.  Find a friend who is good at it, speak with him.     Watch English movies and try to understand every sentence; by movies I mean the movies with the drama themes (try getting a movie with English subtitles).  Learn the accent and improve it.  Remember! you can never improve your skills until you improve your speaking accent.    Moreover,  Try reading novels with simple comprehension and of the basic level.  Do not put your hands directly on mature level novels and text.    Personally,  When I was a kid I used to speak English with myself and I started reading small stories and essays.  Also, I used to watch English movies which made my comprehension improve by, say, 40%    While reading just relax and don't count the number of pages you've read or the number of pages you are left with, Just Read!    Try to enjoy reading and read with expression of words, read out Loud and try reading in silent conditions. I used enjoy reading at late night hours but sometimes I also liked to read in noisy conditions like in the collage bus.    Mark your favourite writers and read their novels because their way of writing will help you.  Do not just try to memorize words without knowing the meaning, also, do not creep in the dictionary too much, just use the difficult words in sentences and before that just look in the dictionary. When you'll use it in the sentence then you'll never forget that word.    Last, Do Not feel ashamed of learning from ordinary people, ask people to mark your mistakes but you need to correct them yourselves.

If you are already engaged in conversation with the person, then you would drop the "excuse me."    To ask someone to tell you "about the time" is a different question and will get a different response.  But to be completed, the question would need to be more specific.  For instance, "Could you tell me about the time when Bruce Springsteen played at the Superbowl?"    To ask that would be to ask the listener to relate a story from the past.|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	softer your tone. you don't want to talk in usual tone. people will think you are being rude. then "can you please tell me what time it is"  or "could you please tell me about the time"    the second statement is what you wrote. add please in that sentence and softer your tone then ask or you could ask using the first statement.|`|bZTpK9uVaa	May I know the time?|`|gdzQtXpKaa	I apologize but could you possibly give me the time please?|`|vQ9U7bvwaa	if your asking what the time is, then just say,     excuse me, do you have the time please?  if they do, they'll tell you, if not just be like "ah not to worry, thanks anyway"
O4oCqaKkaa	Tragically, Desdemona is apparently aware of her imminent death. She, not Othello, asks Emilia to put her wedding sheets on the bed, and she asks Emilia to bury her in these sheets should she die first. The last time we see Desdemona before she awakens to find Othello standing over her with murder in his eyes, she sings a song she learned from her mothers maid: She was in love; and he proved mad / And did forsake her. She had a song of willow. / . . . / And she died singing it. That song tonight / Will not go from my mind (IV.iii.2730). Like the audience, Desdemona seems able only to watch as her husband is driven insane with jealousy. Though she maintains to the end that she is guiltless, Desdemona also forgives her husband (V.ii.133). Her forgiveness of Othello may help the audience to forgive him as well.|`|2LfMvxwBaa	That's pretty much right. A tragic hero brings about their demise by their own shortcomings.

Breathing in the mountain air,  A chipmunk chatters over there,  Bliss and beauty everywhere,  A little bird sings his song.    Feeling nature's harmony,  Wild apples are sweet honey,  Trees majestic so many,  Beauty shows in every form.    The trail entrances with her charm,  An overwhelming sense of calm,  Body, spirit, arm in arm,  Nature is soul's soothing balm.|`|9x8tOaIyaa	You'll feel better!  You'll lose weight!

GXouGu8Aaa	Hi  I'm a student of English translation.  That depends if you are looking for a difficult subject you can choose "poverty" there are some really articles about it on the internet.  But if you are a bit lazy like me :p you can choose just a subject that gets you through the job. like: Smile    How about this?    The Power Of Smile  Like a flower with a pleasant scent, your smile can draw people close enough to see inside you. That's Smile Power. A smile has the power to radiate the qualities that make you beautiful on the inside - kindness, friendship, honesty, respect, patience, and self-control.  Give smiles away like flowers. Let your smile be an invitation for others to get to know the great person behind the smile. Then let people see that your smile doesn't stop at your mouth. It goes all the way to your heart.  Be like a flower. Let your Smile Power bloom!  Dr. Fulton recognizes that patients have greater needs than straight teeth. She and her team are committed to letting each patient know that he or she is more than just an orthodontic case. Every patient is treated with respect, compassion and sensitivity to his or her individuality.  Through her personal interaction with her patients, Dr. Fulton emphasizes the importance of personal excellence. She is especially devoted to promoting positive qualities of character in children - an expression of inner beauty she calls Smile Power.  Young people are exposed to millions of messages about who they are and how they should relate to others. Many of those messages do little to encourage the development of characteristics such as kindness, courtesy, honesty and self-control. In both words and actions, the people in Dr. Fulton's office seek to exemplify Smile Power while encouraging patients of all ages to do the same.  Dr. Fulton and her orthodontic team work to promote a family atmosphere in her office that makes each patient feel valued. Children enjoy the warmth and personal interest that Dr. Fulton and her assistants demonstrate. Adults appreciate the personalized care they receive as their case progresses. A commitment to serving the patient with excellence and understanding is the cornerstone of Dr. Fulton's practice.  Enter Smiling  What is the best way to walk into a crowded room by yourself? The answer is simple: take something very important with you - a smile.  Wearing a smile when you are among strangers is the best way to invite them to get to know you. A smile sends a message that you are friendly and easy to like. It tells people that you have a positive outlook and that you are smiling and attractive on the inside. Your face is the first thing people look at when they meet you for the first time, so why not let it advertise what a great person you are? Why not turn on your Smile Power?  The Bible says, "Don't depend on things like fancy hairdos or gold jewelry or expensive clothes to make you look beautiful. Be beautiful in your heart by being gentle and quiet. This kind of beauty will last, and God considers it very special" (1 Peter 3:3-4; Contemporary English Version).  Now let's talk about using Smile Power in a room full of strangers. Do you know how to mingle? It's really not that hard, especially if the first thing that people see is a smile on your face. Look around the room until you see a group of people who look interesting - looking for other smiles is a good place to start. When you spot a group of friendly looking people, go up to them and say, "Hi." Then tell them your name. You may want to ask a question, such as, "I'm new to this place. What should I do to be a part of what's happening here?" People love to give advice, so you will give them a chance to be friendly toward you if you ask a question like this.  If you find that this group is unfriendly or doesn't share your interests, tell them it was nice meeting them and move on. Sooner or later you'll find people whom you want to be around and who will welcome you to their group. The secret is letting your Smile Power shine through.  Kindness: Your Inner Smile  "Beauty, unaccompanied by virtue, is as a flower without perfume."  -- French Proverb  Virtue is an "old-fashioned" term that means moral excellence or goodness. A virtuous person possesses certain character traits, or values, that society considers worthy of admiration. Honesty, compassion, courage and kindness are some of the values that make us good in the eyes of others.  Like a flower with an pleasant scent, people who exhibit virtue in their daily lives attract admirers. They are respected by their friends and family, valued by their employer and embraced by their community. They make the world a better place. People who are beautiful on the outside may be pleasing to look at, but people with inner beauty leave a sweet fragrance in the lives of everyone they meet.  Of all the different values a person can possess, kindness is a special quality that generates tremendous power. It uplifts heavy hearts, brightens dark situations, heals hurt feelings. Hatred and anger are no match for the power of kindness. And perhaps best of all, every act of kindness gives you a warm glow in your heart that nothing else can match. You are best to yourself when you are good to others.  Being kind doesn't require much effort. In fact, the smallest acts of kindness often mean the most. Letting someone go ahead of you in line, writing a note to a discouraged friend, offering to do a simple chore for a family member - kindness is a gift of great value that costs you very little.  Remember, kindness is an excellent measure of your smile power.  Do all the good you can,  By all the means you can,  In all the ways you can,   In all the places you can,  At all the times you can,  To all the people you can,  As long as ever you can.  -- Ian MacLaren

LsAArkUyaa	Why do you want your baby to read? Babies need to explore the world around them. They need to develop fine and gross motor skills.  Babies aren't meant to be able to read. Programs such as "teach your baby to read" have been proven to not make a difference in a long term intelligence and can in fact make them hate to read. Studies also show that the babies aren't really learning to read, they only recognize the outward shape of the words. So to a baby or toddler cat, cot and cut will look like the same word.    A child also needs to develop hand/eye, and eye/brain (ie tracking words across a page) before they can truly learn to read.      The key to a love of reading is to read to them. A love of reading is the key to developing reading skills.    ETA: you send your baby to a tutor, seriously? Or do you really mean daycare?|`|707gOCvbaa	Buy some leap frog or learning toys for children and that way you can point out certain things while controlling your time and when you are done the child will still have the item to keep busy. good luck.|`|u93eagkqaa	Get involved in the lesson plans.

Personally, I wouldn't be too worried about teaching an infant or toddler to read.  Read to them, surround them with art, words, and numbers, and wait until they show interest.  Some kids do this as toddlers, some as 4th graders.      Just don't push your child to read in the name of achievement.  There are so many other things a baby should be learning.|`|obnMnKRBaa	Hello,    EduWizardS invites you to take absolutely-free tutoring at Eduwizards.

If you're filling out the FAFSA, you can send it to a school you haven't heard back from yet. That's why you have more than one space for which school you want to send it to. The federal deadline for applying is in June I believe, but many states/schools have their own deadline (at my university, it's mid February!). If you don't apply by the deadline, you have less chance of getting financial aid. Also, you should look for scholarships at your top two or three schools now. Some make you apply at the same time you apply for acceptance.

d6XAz5xXaa	It depends.  If there are a large number of references per page then this may become unwieldy.      When I wrote my thesis, I used a numbered scheme - my literature survey of around 25 pages had over 100 references, many of which occurred several times, so I put them at the end of the chapter.  Had I used Harvard, I would probably have done the same and added them at the end of the chapter.  If you've only got one or two per page, use footers by all means, but if (like I had) some of your pages have in excess of around 10 references it might start to look a little clunky.    Check to see if there's a departmental policy, and ask your advisor too.

4A2IxqI6aa	This is a difficult issue.  There's no rule.  Usage is based mostly upon the etymology of the words or phrases, and English has diverse roots.  There is no "tense" or "case" associated with the words either.    As you can tell, there's a sense of direction involved, but English has no rule or form about what direction a word takes.  Look at these:    1. Smoking is bad to me.  2. Smoking is bad for me.  3. Smoking is disgusting to me.  4. Smoking is disgusting for me.  5. Smoking is dangerous to me.  6. Smoking is dangerous for me.    See, these sentences are structurally identical, but you would never say sentences 1 or 4 in English, and 5 would be much more common than 6.    So ... good luck!|`|WvqRJow1aa	When you use 'to me', you are expressing your opinion.  eg. This interview is very important to me -> I consider this interview very important.  &  This interview is very important for me -> Conveys the same as above,   but displays a sense of urgency, like you may really depend on the outcome.  For example, a celebrity might not THINK of an interview as being important, but it still could be important FOR him/her in terms of garnering good public opinion, a larger fan base, endorsing products etc.    With a 'for me', you are expressing something that suits you.  For eg. Soccer is the best sport to me. -> I think that soccer is the best sport of all. I may not actually play it.  &  Soccer is the best sport for me. -> Soccer as a sport suits me. I could never play another as good as it.
d8b6109e783272553611f20d1cf4ba2caa	Footnote to Youth, was written by Jose Garcia Villa in 1933. It is the basic story of marrying very young and questioning the wisdom of making life choices at a young age that must me lived with. It also shows that a father's wisdom is not always something you can base your life on. If you make a decision, even at a young age, sometimes you must live  with the consequences.  Summary:     Dodong wanted to marry Teang and asked his father's permission. Thinking that since they are young, their love would be short, he allowed them to get married. After nine months, Teang gave birth to a child named Blas. For six consecutive years, a new child came along. Teang did not complain even thought she secretly regretted being married at an early age. Sometimes she even wondered if she would have the same life if Lucio, her other suitor who was nine years older than Dodong, was the one she married. Lucio has had no children since the time he married. When Teang and Dodong were twenty they looked like they were fifty.   When Blas was 18, he told his father that he would marry Tona. Dodong did not object, but tried to make Blas think twice before rushing to marriage - because Dodong doesn't want Blas to end up like him.

(This ends with a question mark since it is a question used as a request. We deleted "I wonder if" because, just like "Would you mind," it is used also to phrase a request.

Then you reduce the answer to lowest terms if possible.    [The only time you flip the second set of numbers is if you are dividing for example if the question was 7/12  11/12 you'd flip the second fraction and multiply so you would write:  7/12  11/12 = 7/12 x 12/11 = 7/11]

321517b8db292e8ce3489dc477fc7fb2aa	Make out flashcards. for your vocab test, write down the word on one side and the definition on the other. Then go through them, definition first, and answer them, if you cant answer it, flip to the back and see the answer. keep going through this until you know all of them. if you really want to master it, go through looking at the words and then citing the definition, and check yourself by turning it over and reading the definition. You may do the same thing with major concepts in your text for chapter tests. Take important things, like krebs cycle or cellular respiration or mitosis and take a blank sheet of paper. Practice writing out the phases and what happens in each phase or step. Think of things that remind you of the answer. Like for the classification of humans i remembered it in high school as "All Cats May Pull Hair Halfway Straight". Seems silly and makes no sense but if you use the first letter of each word you can remember the classification of humans, A - Animalia, C - Chordata, M - Mammalia, P - Primate, H - Hominidae, H - Homo, S - Sapiens! See that was pretty easy. The order of the planets i remember as mvemjsun... its a rather hard to say word but it caught in my head... mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune. Flashcards and little memory tricks helped me the most with trivial stuff like this. Sometimes like with the krebs cycle, it helps to draw a picture, that you can store as a mental image and recall and be able to use reasoning to answer questions.
Ue453RT0aa	Well it all depends on how many credits you have already.  Lets say you have 10 credits and your gpa is 0.368  If you take 10 additional credits, and get a 4.0, you will have a 2.183 (add the two gpas and divide by two since same number of credits.  Likewise 3.0, you will have a 1.683, 2.0, you will have a 1.183    If you take 20 additional credits to your 10, and get a 4.0, you will have a 2.789, 3.0 you will have a 2.123, 2.0 you will have a 1.456    I guess a simple formula to use is:  ((old gpa times number of credits)+(new gpa times number of credits)) divided by total number of credits = cumulative gpa.

SLEEP IN PROPER AMOUNT  SOME MORE TIPS:  Start assignments with some curiosity about the material and a positive attitude toward learning.  Designate a place where you go only to study. Use proper lighting.  Identify your distractions. Find ways to decrease them or to postpone them until study breaks (e.g., taking the phone off the hook, turning off instant messenger).  Decrease noises around you while studying. If you need some background music it should be soft. Keep the TV off.  Use "active study" techniques: sit straight in a chair at a desk, start out with questions about the material, outline chapters, underline key phrases after reading a section, write notes in margins, ask yourself what you have learned.  Divide your work into smaller manageable tasks that can be completed in a short period of time. Push yourself to complete one small task, then move on to the next task. Focus on one small task at a time.  Use times of peak alertness for studying difficult or less interesting topics. When you are tired or hungry concentration will be lowered.  When your mind starts to wander come up with some cue words to say to yourself (e.g., "Focus." "Get back on task.") to focus your concentration again.  Take breaks when you have completed tasks or when you feel concentration has decreased. Breaks should be approximately 10-15 minutes.  If you have other assignments or issues on your mind write them down on a "to do" list or take a small step to deal with them. Then get back to focusing on the task at hand.|`|TL5iKwkSaa	hi deepika. i m not perfect enough to guide anyone. i can jst gvie my advice.  listen jst relax. dont take stress n over tension on u. try 2 be happy first. its a very inportant time 4 u. first set ur mood 4 study.  goto outside, park, n listen ur kind of music. then read the first u like. n read it like ur reading any movie story in newspaper.  u can go 4 help with ur friends  u can also take my help  ajay  tanha_feel_2006@yahoo.co.in|`|sVcbBOxYaa	During study you should take short breaks and should listen music in low voice.

o9Tvk36Gaa	Important attributes of a successful teacher include care and compassion, commitment to excellence, valuing success, excellent interpersonal skills, and high ethical standards.     Care and compassion include the understanding that each student has real life factors at work outside of the classroom, which affect day to day learning.  Being willing to get to know my students individual concerns, demonstrates my care for them.  As a qualified facilitator of the Rainbows program, which reaches out to those children grieving a death, divorce or other painful family transition, I have had both training and experience in listening to and validating childrens feelings.  By getting to know my students I can apply different strategies to better enable them to understand the subject matter.    By coming to know where students are, both socially and academically, the teacher is able to offer differentiated instruction that meets the needs of individual students.  This valuing of success, is the desire to see all students experience accomplishment.  Helping students set attainable goals and encouraging them as they move toward them helps to engage students in the task of learning.  By being available to offer assistance when needed, the teacher propels the student forward in his or her learning, and the student experiences achievement and avoids frustration.             Commitment to excellence and lifelong learning is another important attribute of a teacher.  Teachers must seek out and participate in ongoing professional learning.  This learning can also be self directed in the form of inquiry, reflection, and discussion with others.  It is important for teachers to be willing to learn from others and to turn mistakes into positive learning experiences.  Teachers will gain new perspectives from experts in their field, from their own students, and their parents, as they are open to learning.    A teacher also needs to have excellent interpersonal skills.  Teachers deal with students, fellow teachers, support staff, administrators, and parents each school day.  One needs to know when to be firm with people and when to be gentle.  The method that I draw on is to take a deep breath, and a step back from the emotions of the moment, while trying to see the situation from the others perspective, realizing that I make mistakes.  Students want to be treated with respect and equality, just as adults do.  Taking time to actively listen builds rapport and gives clues about handling everyday situations.  Modeling interpersonal skills helps students to get along with each other and later to become more productive members of society.   As an influencer of children a teacher must require herself to have ethical standards.  It is necessary to value honesty, integrity, and a willingness to be transparent; to be a good example for all children, treating people well, and thinking the best of others is something to practice.  Life often hands us situations in which we must choose the correct path, not necessarily the easy one.  A teacher has a tremendous opportunity to be an influencer for good in the many lives she touches.  It is my goal to be such an educator.|`|cl61AU7Kaa	A good teacher should have such personality traits to leave desirable impression on a child's mind.She must be a living example of virtues she wants her students to acquire.Her behaviour,conduct and attitude should be positive.Above all she should be adequately prepared and well equipped and have a core of knowledge.And last but not the least she should be a calm and cool personality not only to the extent of showing any anger but to remain undisturbed under all circumstances.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	low expectations  small financial need  patience with stupid bosses|`|kVc0e6RZaa	Funny, but not sarcastic.

C9AbiTDdaa	when all zero's become Heros , then it becomes Hero's formula      Just kidding !!!|`|xACwWEXHaa	Are you asking about heroic couplets?    The "formula" for making a heroic couplet is two rhymed lines written in iambic pentameter, tied together both by rhyme scheme and by the idea expressed.    (Iambic means a rhythm pattern of one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable.  Pentameter means a set of five iambs per line.)  An example of two such couplets - "A frequently-cited example illustrating the use of heroic couplets is this passage from Cooper's Hill by John Denham, part of his description of the Thames:        O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream      My great example, as it is my theme!      Though deep, yet clear, though gentle, yet not dull,      Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full. "  (quoted from wikipedia article about heroic couplets)    Something else you might be thinking of is a heroic archetype.  that's the "formula" for making a literary hero, like Superman or Spiderman, though "ordinary" humans can be heroes.

The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by molting.

Hamburger is meat that comes from cows, not pigs.  The main meats that come from pigs are pork, bacon, and ham (which is basically what the initial sentence is saying).    Hopefully this answered your question, but if not, feel free to write me a message and I'd be happy to discuss and try to help you out some more!      P.S.  Actually, ALL edible meat that comes from a pig is called "pork"... bacon and ham are types of pork.  So, it's not really accurate to list "pork, bacon and ham" as three separate things... but now I'm just being picky. :)

Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).    Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.
