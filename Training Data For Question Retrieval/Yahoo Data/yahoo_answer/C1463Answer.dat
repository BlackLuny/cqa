Seeking a spiritual answer beyond the physical comes very natural to humans.<br>  <br>  What I find bizarre, however, is why religious FUNDAMENTALISM is so rampant given modern technology!<br>  <br>  For instance, why do so many people cling to the idea of the world being only 6,000 years old in the face of science?  It's not so strange to imagine a supernatural force working behind the scenes; which designed physics and the process we know as evolution.  But how can people believe in a very narrow interpretation of just a few verses from a book which is obviously written to be understood by people who had no scientific knowledge at all?<br>  <br>  It's easy to understand God as the force which invented science and guided some things in human development but to believe that a couple obscure phrases from a bronze age book basically SUPERSEDES science is downright strange and speaks to a dark reality in human nature.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	Intellectual dishonesty, or plain ignorance.

Yes, the word of God is important to us...but it doesn't do a bit of good for me to be a son of Abraham if I don't honor God in action, thought, or deed.   That is what Jesus was referring to.   Your bloodline is not going to get you into heaven, nor will reading the bible.   Living out the word of God in everyday life is what Jesus wanted from all Christians.   Reading the bible, going to church, and doing praise and worship are noble and worthy actions...but every single one of us has a responsibility to each other.   We are called to feed the poor, visit those in prison, babysit for a single mother who cannot afford child care.    That is Christ in action...not just in word.   We carry Christ out to others by the love we show them.<br>  <br>  This is why Christ condemned the Pharisees....while they were acting all high and mighty they weren't ministering to the people.   Sure they followed the law...but they failed to follow the heart of Jesus.    They persecuted Jesus for healing on the Sabbath...because it wasn't in the bible, he wasn't supposed to do it...they cursed, condemned, and persecuted him for this.    <br>  <br>  How many of us give of our time for others?   That is the real question we need to be asking....how much time do we give to ourselves and how much time do we really give serving God and his people?|`|xmy94psMaa	Actually there's very little evidence that Jesus existed at all, never mind spoke. <br>  I've linked to a website examining both sides of the argument, it's from a (usually) very objective site called Religious Tolerance.

That is why I mainly study Jesus' public sermons like the Beatitudes et al.  -- I figure the Paul followers of the the early church just plugged in falsified Jesus' quotes in the Gospels to support Paul's doctrines.  (Jesus' public sermons are so different than Paul's doctrines and those fuzzy/weird  quotes you alluded to.)  example: After reading Jesus' beatitudes it it would be difficult to believe that Jesus ever said "to hate your mother and father and follow Jesus")<br>  <br>  edit: I infer that you do know why Jesus' public sermons could not be falsified as easily by the Paul followers.|`|AA10641825	Yeah they quoted him saying "Except ye eat my flesh."<br>  <br>  Only they didn't know he was telling them they are maggots.<br>  <br>  So they devised a holy ritual, a somber one; which in some churches is replayed every damn Sunday.

5Rn5BHjQaa	Mormon.org doesn't discuss some of the more controversial doctrines of the LDS church (such as Heavenly Father creating the physical body of Jesus via sexual union with Mary), nor does it go into certain episodes of Mormon history (such as the Mountain Meadows massacre).<br>  <br>  If you want to know more, start with a book called "Mormon Doctrine," written by the late Bruce McConkie, an  Apostle of the LDS church. It's written encyclopedia-style, so you can look up specific topics if you don't have time to read the whole book. Jerald and Sandra Tanner have also done extensive research on Mormonism, and have published many helpful books that contain material not found on mormon.org.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	It doesn't prepare you for the society of people who will judge as being inferior for being a convert.

That includes cleaning the church bathrooms because LDS no longer employ janitors. And lower status folks like converts get the lower class assignments.

From the merging of these two belief systems came the various pantheons of deities that most people usually think of as "pagan".

This person looked at the glow in Buddha's face and asked who he was. <br>  <br>  The Buddha said, "I am awake."<br>  <br>  The word "buddha" means 'awake.' After he said who he was, everyone referred to him as "The Buddha." He was enlightened - awake to the truth of human suffering, its causes, and how to stop the suffering.<br>  <br>  So that's your sentence:  "I am awake."

62s7J8sHaa	I apologize that this is so long. I have seen your questions before, and I am giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are merely misinformed.<br>  <br>  However, your really skewed misconceptions need some help. <br>  <br>  "Magic underwear" - are mentioned in the New Testament: KJV <br>  Rev. 3: 4<br>    4 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.<br>  <br>  There are other, less obvious references to them. Moses' writings describe robes worn by the priests while performing their temple duties.<br>  <br>  Our temple garments are symbols of the sacred covenants that we have made with our God, and also represent the protection that he promises to those who honorably keep those covenants. Sometimes, that protection is physical, but always is spiritual. While there have been instances of miraculous protection, those are rare, and certainly not universal. Worthy Mormons have been injured and killed while wearing them.<br>  <br>  As to the Native Americans. There is a promise and warning for the American continents. As long as  the people who live here worship their God and keep his commandments - and that includes all people living to the best of their ability - God promises peace and prosperity. As soon as the majority of people turn away from God, the promise is removed, and the God stops preventing the problems that he has been saving us from. Once again, this does not refer only to Mormons.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the greatest curse God can give is withholding his blessings.<br>  <br>  The Native Americans had known God and understood his commandments, yet they turned away from him and embraced murder, war and tribalism instead. God withheld the blessings that they needed to withstand the onslaught of the vicious white European conquerors who wiped out millions of them. In the Book of Mormon it says, "...it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished..." Mormon 4: 5<br>  <br>  However, Americans need to know that we are still under the same obligation that the Native Americans were. We are now setting ourselves up for poverty, civil war or attack by enemy nations because of our refusal to obey God's commands and to honor him with prayer and gratitude. <br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon is a second witness of Jesus Christ. It does not take anything away from Christianity except the false doctrines that crept into the Church after the death of the Apostles. It adds more of the word of God to clarify and strengthen the Bible.<br>  <br>  BTW, the gospel of John was authored AFTER the Revelation of John was written. Does that prevent John's testimony from being scripture?|`|IqPz1PZOaa	.<br>  What is this I hear about magic mormon underwear, and the Native Americans being wiped out by christian European, as god's punishment for the natives rejecting Jesus? ~mouse<br>  <br>  The native Americans lack the slightest DNA match to any european nations and Israelites, Nephites, Knee-Bites, Bite-Me's or any other characters talked about inside the unholy full of holes. Book Of Mormon.<br>  <br>  Yes, all good Mormons wear special garments underneath of their regular clothes.  Constant and repeated inferences are always attributed to both spiritual protection as well as some sort of physical shield.  Sometimes proving God's favor on the seemingly righteous Latter Dazed Saints.<br>  <br>  Joseph's Myth<br>  <br>  I wish that I had some newer material, but so much of the LDS fiction seems to continually go on and on as simply unsubstantiated and worse.

Just look at other fairy worshippers.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Whenever you use the term "magic underwear" you're either purposefully being very rude and very disrespectful, or your 100% oblivious and hopefully you'll learn and won't make that mistake again.  Using that kind of language is a button pusher, hence the "troll" comments.  <br>  <br>  They're called garments (LDS garments, temple garments, etc), and no, they don't have magical properties.  They're basically like longer boxer shorts and a t-shirt.  They're really not that interesting.  Adult Mormons can choose to wear them after they've gone through one of the LDS temples.  They remind us to keep the commandments and they promote modesty.  <br>  <br>  We don't believe that the native americans were wiped out as god's punishement. <br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon does tell the story of some people who lived in the Americas from about 2000 BC to about 400 AD.  We know little of what happened between 400 AD and 1500 AD, however, we do believe that some of the native americans had ancestors who were in the Book of Mormon.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Mormons who have gone through the temple wear garments to remind them of their covenants.<br>  A white family came to the American continent on a boat, 2 sons rebelled and God made their skin darker, and all of their decedents had darker skin. A long long long long time later there was a war and the darker skinned people killed all the white people, because the white people were bad (God wouldn't save them). You can read all about it in the Book of Mormon.<br>  I think thats what you were talking about (but the whites didn't wipe out the native Americans, its the other way around).|`|GPn55rjTaa	Get some new material.<br>  <br>  TROLL!!<br>  <br>  Seriously go to work, or get a job, or go to school.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Now now little mouse, everyone knows that is silly.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	You heard wrong on both accounts.<br>  <br>  Our underwear isn't magical, and obviously, the Native Americans weren't wiped out by anyone.<br>  <br>  P.S. - Joseph Smith isn't our "messiah".

GQ6f2wSbaa	Ah, my friend, I have a perceptive appreciation of people, and intuitively know a few things about you.  You are one of those people who does not feel complete unless you are in a relationship with someone.  You feel you are missing out on life if the company you keep is your own.  You are one of those people who feels the need to have someone else to validate them, to make you feel assured of yourself....the only mirror you care to look in is the reflection of yourself seen through someone else.  <br>  <br>  Before you go diving off with the next man you meet, take some time to really get to know and appreciate the person in whose skin you awaken every morning---yourself.  You won't ever have the grounding to be a part of a team until you know exactly what part of the team you are, what contribution you make, what your own worth is.<br>  <br>  I guess I'm saying that the next time you *dive*, try diving for the person in the mirror.  In the end, that person will be your best friend, and, honestly, the one person in this world you can depend on above all others.<br>  <br>  (((((((Ruby)))))))|`|qcwYVwUQaa	Losasha, WTF? Do you even read the questions anymore.<br>  She said diver.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	There are some apparent contradictions in what you're saying:<br>  <br>  "I tend to jump head first into relationships with people who are also divers"<br>  and<br>  "the vast majority of men are not divers"<br>  <br>  Do you just mean that the people you have these diving relationships with are thin on the ground? Well - that's mate-selection for you: it's supposed to be a fine sieve.<br>  <br>  But implicit in your Q is that you're finding the results dissatisfying. That, too, is par for the course. I'm not sure whether your implication that slower relationships would work better is correct. They might, but how do you do that if you're working against your instincts? Basing the whole thing on subterfuge sounds tricky at best, and possibly dangerous.<br>  <br>  You're not stating what you want in any detail. I infer that you don't get it. Do you know what your partners want? I could tell you one requirement, but you may already have noticed.|`|AA11058044	I tend to have the opposite problem.  I wait entirely too long before pursuing a relationship, and by then I'm so deep in the "Friend Zone" that there's no way out.<br>  <br>  All of the successful, long term relationships I've been in have been with women who were smart enough and aggressive enough to drag me into diving with them.  Not that any of them have really been all that long term.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just need to find the right hesistant, non-diving dude, and pull him in with you.  The balance might be what you need.|`|AA10067344	Wise men say: "only fools rush in."  -the King<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd work on slowing it down a bit.  You shouldn't change who you are, but try to discipline yourself to not "dive" too quickly.  I think going slower helps get a better picture of who someone really is whereas "diving" usually involves a bit of projecting who we want them to be.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	There is no such thing as a "non-diver".

Many people make the mistake of wanted that first person they see to be the man that they want and he is not the one. If you are patient and pray then God will send you a HUSBAND not a boyfriend because the bible says nothing about finding a boyfriend. The bible says a Man that finds a Wife finds a good thing. Also its not a sin to fall in love but it is a sin to have sex before marraige. So take all of this into consideration please.<br>  Not waiting can result in being with someone who doesnt cares or treat you bad and then you will start blaming God when its actually your fault and not his.|`|IDZTtipeaa	Being a "diver" myself, I never attempted to tame the behavior.  I had a few long-term relationships which were good and bad.  I simply tried to take away something from each girl I dated, narrowing down what I truly wanted and what I could not deal with (even if it was something I was OK with at first).<br>  When I met my current wife, I dove right in.  She was not the same way, but we had so much in common that it simply worked.  I recognized in her so much of what I wanted long-term.  <br>  Whether or not we both liked to move quickly turned out to be irrelevant.  We were (are) a match.
lbGVdgr1aa	I want to choose 1 but it is incredibly hard to let go of 2 when your faith is weak
6DmsiLGbaa	No, we're not alike at all.  The FLDS branched off from the LDS church a long time ago, but while we do have the same roots, we have little in common now.  They follow different leaders, teach different doctrines, and have organized both their families and their church in very different ways.  I think many of them still read from the Book of Mormon, but other than that, we're not really connected in any way.  I'm not trying to be offensive towards the FLDS, because I'm sure they're good people, but they're an entirely different religion.  <br>  <br>  As for the polygamy thing...it was never the "founding belief" of our religion.  Though a small minority of Mormons did once practice polygamy, it was hardly one of the most important aspects of our religion (the most important part would be Christ).  It was a necessity and perhaps a test of our faith, but nothing more than that.  Maybe God will reinstate the practice; maybe He won't. I personally hope not, but that's up to God, and we neither teach nor believe that it's a certainty.  <br>  <br>  And the same goes for the whole "come to power" thing.  You do know that we're not trying to take over the world, right?|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	*rolls eyes*  Do some research, their ideology is very different.<br>  <br>  The FLDS have gone AGAINST the teachings of Joseph Smith.<br>  <br>  The FLDS went againstJoseph's successor, thus they went against Joseph's EXPRESS teachings.<br>  <br>  Additionally,<br>  <br>  -Joseph taught the importance of education, including for women.<br>  -FLDS discourage education, especially of women.<br>  <br>  -FLDS teach that a man must be married to at least 3 women to gain exaltation.<br>  -Joseph Smith taught that all that's required is marriage to 1 woman.<br>  -In addition, even when the LDS did practice polygamy, less half the Mormon population practiced it. It was not a requirement of all members in order for them to gain exaltation.<br>  <br>  -FLDS apparently don't care much about the consent of the other wives.<br>  -When the LDS did practice polygamy, the consent of the first wife was required.<br>  <br>  -FLDS have sex beds in their temples.<br>  -Joseph Smith would have found this to be an abomination.<br>  <br>  -FLDS seclude themselves.<br>  -Joseph Smith sent people all over the world to share the message and encourage Mormons to be involved in the community.<br>  <br>  I could go on. But the point is that it's easy to just look at the polygamy thing, but a minimal amount of research shows that there are huge differences between what Joseph Smith taught and what the FLDS teach today.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Today's LDS church is positioning itself as the last ultra conservative bastion of hope against a failing world. (Apparently they all watch too much Faux News).<br>  <br>  They don't even allow polygamy for members who live in countries where it is legal.<br>  <br>  It doesn't fit their image anymore. They hate the FLDS for the publicity it has caused them, and the damage to the new image they are trying to create.<br>  <br>  FLDS split off from the LDS church 100 years ago. Other than that, they believe in the Book of Mormon (and they are called MORMONs), the early prophets, the Doctrine and Covenants.<br>  <br>  They only significant change in the LDS church since they left is the acceptance of Blacks and the prohibition against ear piercing.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	The difference?<br>  One group of people decided that the prophet of God was wrong and they went their own way. What led up to that decision is a completely different subject and I do not feel qualified to properly discuss it.|`|szsSPSmPaa	The F is for Fundamentalist.  Just like non Mormon fundamentalists.  There are lots of differences.  Primarily, the LDS aren't very fond of the FLDS because of the bad press it has brought them.|`|c1anFbMaaa	Someone's anti-mormon today.|`|AA11654248	The F is the difference|`|WyICbuPqaa	The FLDS are few in numbers.  I really have no idea what they believe except that they have turned their back on the living prophet, ignored the laws of the land, ignored the cessation of polygamy, and have ordained women to their false priesthood.  Unlike most Mormons, the FLDS are very clanish.|`|TzY9vkinaa	They are quite different, im sure there are some similarities though.|`|GPn55rjTaa	Good grief NO!  We are completely different.  IT is like calling Lutherans or Protestants Catholics.  FLDS wanted to keep polygamy after the church stopped practicing it.  They were excommunicated, left and repopulated in a different area.  NO MORMONS ARE POLYGAMISTS.<br>  <br>  And is polygamy ever comes back, God will do it after the 2nd coming.  It isn't needed anymore.|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	1- Theyre very different<br>  2- Youre speculating about polygamy, nobody is waiting for it to come back and because of the culture people would have a hard time with it. One thing that people do know will come back and soon is the law of consecration, where the members will have to donate anything other than what they need to maintain themselves in order for everyone to have the basic needs and so theyre no poor in the church.......and yeah not many people are anxious for that to come back|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	LMBO.  "in power"?  What does that mean?  And no, we don't believe we will reinstate polygamy.  And it's not the founding belief of our religion either.  The restoration of Jesus Christ's church is our founding belief.  <br>  Furthermore, LDS Mormons have never lived in compounds and have never purposely seperated themselves from others.  We live just like everyone else does.  We don't have arranged marriages, we don't have child brides, we don't practice polygamy, we don't wear pioneer garb.  We also follow the laws of the land.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Based on your logic, there's no difference between Judaism and Christianity either.<br>  <br>  No difference between the Catholic church and all other non-restoration churches (Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, Protestants, etc).  <br>  <br>  Another flaw is that the LDS faith and the FLDS faith do not have the same philosophies or ideologies.  The LDS church teaches it's members to honor, obey, and sustain the laws.  The FLDS leaders teach their members how to hide from authority, how to break laws and not get caught, and how to manipulate welfare systems.  <br>  <br>  What do you mean once that they're "in power"???  We believe that Jesus Christ directs our church.  He directs it through our leaders.  It is his will, not theirs, that happens.  While you clearly don't believe that, your disbelief does not mean that it isn't so.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, polygamy isn't "the founding belief" in our faith.  It doesn't even appear in the 13 articles of our faith.  <br>  <br>  There is a massive difference between the FLDS church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  If you can't see that, you're completely blind.

4Uyv7T5Vaa	If Allah were to enlarge the provision for His Servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth; but he sends (it) down in due measure as He pleases. For He is with His Servants Well-acquainted, Watchful. [42:27]<br>  <br>  Allah sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place: Yet was it ungrateful for the favours of Allah. so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror (in extremes) (closing in on it) like a garment (from every side), because of the (evil) which (its people) wrought. [16:112]<br>  <br>  There was, for Saba, aforetime, a Sign in their home-land - two Gardens to the right and to the left. "Eat of the Sustenance (provided) by your Lord, and be grateful to Him: a territory fair and happy, and a Lord Oft-Forgiving! [34:15]<br>  <br>  Why was there not a single township (among those We warned), which believed,- so its faith should have profited it,- except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the penalty of ignominy in the life of the present, and permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while. [010:098]<br>  <br>  Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin. [17:31]<br>  <br>  Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges and restricts the Sustenance to such of his servants as He pleases: and nothing do ye spend in the least (in His cause) but He replaces it: for He is the Best of those who grant Sustenance. [34:39]<br>  <br>  Let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. After a difficulty, Allah will soon grant relief. [65:7]<br>  <br>  O ye who believe! Spend out of (the bounties) We have provided for you, before the Day comes when no bargaining (Will avail), nor friendship nor intercession. Those who reject Faith they are the wrong-doers.[2:254]<br>  <br>  O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities: But let there be amongst you Traffic and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful! [4:29]<br>  <br>  O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; but fear Allah. that ye may (really) prosper.[3:130]<br>  <br>  Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same as those who do mischief on earth? Shall We treat those who guard against evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right? [38:28]<br>  <br>  Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked.[2:276]<br>  <br>  Do no mischief on the earth, after it hath been set in order, but call on Him with fear and longing (in your hearts): for the Mercy of Allah is (always) near to those who do good. [7:56]<br>  <br>  "But seek, with the (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on thee, the Home of the Hereafter, nor forget thy portion in this world: but do thou good, as Allah has been good to thee, and seek not (occasions for) mischief in the land: for Allah loves not those who do mischief." [28:77]<br>  <br>  That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend not high- handedness or mischief on earth: and the end is (best) for the righteous. [28:83]<br>  <br>  But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home! [13:25]<br>  <br>  Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have earned, that ((Allah)) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from Evil). [30:41]<br>  <br>  ........And did not Allah Check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief: But Allah is full of bounty to all the worlds. [2:251]<br>  <br>  "And withhold not things justly due to men, nor do evil in the land, working mischief. [26:183]<br>  <br>  Say: If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah, or His Messenger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait until Allah brings about His decision: and Allah guides not the rebellious.

Stand out firmly for God, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice.  Be just; that is next to piety; and fear God.

They highlight a global trend of increasing antipathy towards Christians.<br>  Open Doors’ major new report, now in its seventh year, shows that it has become much harder to be a<br>  Christian in many parts of the world, especially in the Middle East, although North Korea is still by far the<br>  most dangerous place on earth to be a Christian.<br>  In Afghanistan the situation is tense as a result of increased pressure from the Taliban, even in areas where<br>  fighting is not taking place. Gayle Williams, a Christian aid worker in the capital Kabul, was killed last year<br>  because she was ‘spreading Christianity’. In Somalia, the number of incidents against Christians increased<br>  dramatically in 2008. In Iraq, the Christian minority faced increasing violence. Churches were attacked or<br>  damaged by bombs; Christians received death threats and several were murdered, abused and/or<br>  kidnapped.<br>  In other countries there are limited grounds for optimism.

When did they start studying the actual births?  Just over the past decade?  That's hardly enough time to gather enough evidence on the subject.

Back to your question:  Based purely upon these articles, and upon what you say about the Islam prophecy, yes, it does sound similar.

AA11297267	There's no more evidence that the Annunaki were real than there is that the christian god is real.  They're mythical gods from the Babylonian creation myth -- and that myth *doesn't* say they created ancient human civilization, by the way.<br>  <br>  As for the Sumerians and the solar system -- they were good naked-eye astronomers.  They spent a lot of time tracking the positions of the planets with regard to the "fixed" stars.  Since Uranus is visible to the naked eye, it's possible they noticed it, and possible they even got its color right (it's easy to see that Venus is yellow-orange, Mars is red, and Jupiter is yellow-orange just using your naked eye)...but the "proofs" that the Sumerians knew about Uranus and Neptune don't hold up under much scrutiny.  More evidence that they actually knew of it and charted it would be necessary to accept such a claim.<br>  <br>  There is evidence that ancient native americans knew Venus was a crescent -- documented on rock drawings.  It's quite possibly true, but doesn't infer any magical or supernatural powers on those people.  People with good eyesight today can make out that Venus goes through crescent phases with just their eyes, it's not that hard.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|midmBgJJaa	My real opinion? <br>  <br>  I think some fat guy in America spends too much time reading conspiracy theories in his basement. <br>  <br>  (no insult intended to Americans)|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	Zechariah Sitchen invented a very novel re-translation of ancient Sumerian texts.

But this does not mean she can't be wrong, or have persons within who do wrong things. <br>  <br>  Many non-Catholics often believe that the actions of the Church during certain times in history somehow make her less "the true Church." This is not what being the true Church is based on. There are four marks of the true Church, they are One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic. No where in that list do you see "perfect." <br>  <br>  The Church is about leading the faithful to heaven. No matter how corrupt some Catholic leaders have been, those who sought God in his Church have found...and salvation is what it is all about. <br>  <br>  The Bible says there will be apostacies, that there will be weeds in with the wheat. Just because there are weeds does not mean the wheat is less true wheat.|`|AA10239241	The Catholic Church is the church of Jesus Christ because it was founded by him.  Yes, it has a very bloody history because it is made up of sinful men.  But because Jesus declared that the gates of Hell will not prevail against his church and he promised the Holy Spirit to guide his church into all Truth, there have not been and moral or doctrinal errors taught.  The church as an institution is holy because of Jesus -- certainly not because of her members, although many have led great and holy lives.  The church is the bride of Christ, but like all brides, we have our individual flaws.  These, however, do not take away from the gift of grace that God has given to the Church herself.  It is only in the areas of faith and morals that the Pope is infallible because of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.  Does this mean that popes, bishops and other members sin?  Of course they do!  Even Protestant churches accept fully some of the matters of faith that the church has set down.  Among them:<br>  <br>  Most Protestants accept the same 27 books of the New Testament which was canonized in approx. the 4th century (more than 1,000 years before there were any Protestants)<br>  The doctrine of the Trinity<br>  Baptism as a sacrament<br>  Jesus Christ as fully God and fully man<br>  <br>  Traditions of men accepted by most other groups:<br>  <br>  Worship on Sunday<br>  Christmas on Dec. 25 (almost all Orthodox Christian communities celebrate it on "our" January 7th<br>  Easter on a Sunday (as opposed to always being on the 14th of Nissan as it was for the first century or so of the early church).

The fact that the Church has survived so much corruption and struggles is testimony to the Church's divine origin.<br>  <br>  Any organization that is merely human filled with a history of unwise, corrupt leaders would have collapsed early on.

Even Roman coins were found in one excavation in the Holy Land. <br>  <br>  We do a lot of critical analysis when we decided to follow God.. Take some time, dear one, to do your research before asking such a question. Most of the cities mentioned in the Bible have been either excavated and found, or are still inhabited. The evidence, that he has left, would stand in any court of the law.. You can NOT say the same of your evidence..<br>  <br>   How many eye witness accounts do you need? How many miracles do you need? The Bible has been proven to be historically accurate as well as archaeologically accurate.. ((these peoples still inhabit the lands of the bible.. This is their history)) And yet you have so little evolutionary evidence to back up your arguments.. But you want to belittle us..  Did you find the link? Hmmm, Thought so.. Still no proof.. <br>  <br>  There are over 600 writings about Jesus that have nothing to do with Religion.  They did keep and have kept records.. There are tax, census, criminal, land records readily available.. <br>  <br>  We do not deny evolution, All things evolve. We deny Evolving into a whole new species, from another species.. The differences between the simian and human is significant.<br>  <br>  1- Evolution is a theory. Thus : THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. Here is the definition of Theory ..<br>  <br>  1 - Abstract thought : speculation.<br>  2 - A hypothesis assumed for the sake of argument or investigation.<br>  3 - An unproved assumption : conjecture.<br>  <br>  You (they) present the theory of evolution as: FACT..<br>  <br>  You have NO ( well, hardly any) evidence that stands up to real scrutiny, or at least nothing tangible to make me think otherwise.. The problem, I think, (in my humble opinion) stems from the fact that folks are *assuming* that 6000 years ago God created everything. When in fact the bible does not say what length of time passed between the creation of the world and when it was actually inhabited by the human race..<br>  <br>  And yet is so little evolutionary evidence to back up evolution arguments..

Or show the world your proof.. <br>  <br>  Darwin`s Theory of Evolution..<br>  A Theory in Crisis...<br>  <br>  in light of the tremendous advances we've made in molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics over the past fifty years. We now know that there are in fact tens of thousands of irreducibly complex systems on the cellular level. Specified complexity pervades the microscopic biological world. Molecular biologist Michael Denton wrote, "Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small, weighing less than 10-12 grams, each is in effect a veritable micro-miniaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up altogether of one hundred thousand million atoms, far more complicated than any machinery built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world."<br>  <br>  And we don't need a microscope to observe irreducible complexity. The eye, the ear and the heart are all examples of irreducible complexity, though they were not recognized as such in Darwin's day. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, Darwin confessed, "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."|`|hnhb119Laa	It is sad how few people understand this is a joke, in resonse to all the ridiculous accusations that evolution is a religion.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Why worship a biologist?<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't?|`|FINMe8Vjaa	So let me get this straight.

mOaG5ueZaa	Your logic is flawed. Jesus Himself said He came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. You can't reject those laws. Secondly, it is not common knowledge amongst scholars about mistranslation; that is an atheist lie. The truth is, the book of Romans, chapter 1, speaks against homosexuality, plus Jesus reaffirmed that marriage is between a man and a woman. Wikipedia sites are not reliable at all, because anyone can edit them, even people with no knowledge of what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is an affront to God, and for those of us who believe in taking a stand for truth, cannot allow it. But truth has become an ugly word in today's society.

Ever notice how these Protestant groups work the crowd into an emotional frenzy, build up the anticipation to the climatic moment, and then..... bang!  Suddenly people think they feel some sort of "call".<br>  <br>  If "being saved" is real, why does it never happen at the office in front of your computer?  Why doesn't it happen in traffic jams, or McDonald's?  Why only at these ultra-heightened-emotional protestant shindigs?  We're talking about God here.  Why wouldn't he "save" people any and everywhere?<br>  <br>  Because this "saved" dogma is a bunch of baloney. That's why.  It's nothing but manipulation.

I have many friends and a few of my extended family members who practice Catholicism. If you believe that Catholicism is the path that you need to take and it helps you feel close to God, more power to you friend.

So what makes these good Bible-believing (sic) people think that He now approves of worship services that are indistinguishable from a clown act in the circus?<br>  <br>  If that's the "truth," they can have it.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

QuaVnaOEaa	Your experience is not abnormal...it happens to me every now and then when I am in the twilight zone between being awake and asleep. What I hear is news reports....strange as it sounds, that's what I hear. At first I thought my subconscious was making them up but I put that idea down because the way the voice talked and the vocabulary it used was not really mine, in fact, it was amazing how fluent the speaker was. Just the other night it happened again and it was a report about stampeding elephants in Cambodia. I had never heard anything about elephants going on a rampage in that country, either by reading or listening to news reports. So I went on Google and found out that elephants indeed had gone on a rampage and trampled down village huts and killed a few people, not on that day but some time in the past. My health is good in all departments so I know my experience is not a symptom of an illness. It is very intriguing and it often makes me think of paranormal possibilities with respect to certain strange and spooky things that happen in the quantum world. I have come to believe that our knowledge of the world and the universe we live in is extremely narrow and that some time in the future, physicists and philosophers will discover new facts that will go a long way in explaining paranormal events, our listening experiences, what being aware and alive is and its material and spiritual symbiotic relationship. I even will go out on a limb and predict that a fifth force will be discovered by science that will explain many strange events and phenomena that will cause the scientists and religionists to say, "Oh my, well now, that's so simple, why didn't I think of that before?"  When my reports come to me I am not frightened in the least, I rather enjoy them. It would be interesting to hear the experience of others, so, let's hear from you.....|`|rUgC7SPsaa	This same thing has happened to me all too many times.  And I have to admit, paranormal or not, it's creepy.  Startling.  <br>  <br>  It reminds me of Tinkerbell's quote to Peter Pan:<br>  <br>  "You know that place between sleep and awake, the place where you can still remember dreaming? That's where I'll always love you, Peter Pan."<br>  <br>  The male's voice you heard may or may not have been a manifestation of your imagination.  Keep in mind as well, that those who believe in paranormal and one's ability to transcend their body in sleep, this time is when one is the most vulnerable to out of body experiences...|`|d2dkgYRaaa	It's happened to me. I'd be laying there getting to sleep. On the cusp between being conscious and awake, I could hear conversations, and I'd force myself awake again, only to realize I was dreaming.<br>  <br>  This seems to be a natural phenomenon. Dreams usually happen when the conscious is put under a deep sleep and the subconscious surfaces, relaying information to the conscious (dreams) through the use of symbols. <br>  <br>  However, sometimes we bring our own conscious into sleep with us, and therefore conjoining with the subconscious as if it were one being. However, the conscious is forever questioning, while the subconny goes along with the flow. <br>  <br>  So, when the conscious mind sees or hears something that may not be logical in any way shape or form, it scares itself from sleep and you wake up. However, since you were only HALF asleep, because the conscious mind has not rested, you'd feel as if you were still awake. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6kRhLbs9aa	In the bible....when Samuel was a boy he was sleeping and heard a voice but he thought it was the priest who was raising him. He ran in to see what he wanted but the man told Samuel if he heard the voice again it must be God speaking to him and that he should listen and speak to the Lord! ....(this is very paraphrased but you can find this in 1 Samuel) So, maybe is was the Lord speaking to you! What a blessing that would be! I would just pray and ask the Lord to show you what He wants you to know! may God bless you!|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Hearing voices is normal, especially when tired.

ridu0Rtwaa	Yes well documented!!<br>  <br>  Acceptance of a supernatural claim tends to promote cooperative social relationships. This communication demonstrates a willingness to accept, without scepticism, the influence of the speaker in a way similar to a child's acceptance of the influence of a parent.  By encouraging this kind of behavior where the most intense social relationships occur it facilitates the lack of skeptcism and deters more open minded thinking.<br>  <br>  Indoctrination reinforced with propoganda closes minds!!<br>  <br>  2.  On the other hand Science has shown atheists have a higher intelligence than people with a strong religious faith. The difference is 5.8 points according to findings in developmental psychology!!!    <br>  <br>  More members of the "intellectual elite" considered themselves atheists than the national average.<br>  <br>  Only 7 percent of members of the American National Academy of Sciences believed in God. Whilst only 3.3 percent believed in God in the UK’s Royal Society. <br>  <br>  Several Gallup poll studies of the general population have shown that those with higher IQ’s tend not to believe in God."|`|a63qA8wzaa	it means that you aren't open minded
a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	Physically, the model for the Garden of Eden is supposed to have been somewhere in Iraq, as defined by the rivers flowing out of the place, which include the Tigris and Euphrates.<br>  <br>  But I think it's a metaphor, a metaphor for innocence.  Eden is where you live before you become aware of the "knowledge" of good & evil.<br>  <br>  I think in the original Hebrew, "knowledge" actually means something close to "experience," as in carnal knowledge. So Eden is where you exist before you start doing good and evil and becoming aware of it.|`|PsN79isyaa	Last I heard it was around the Iraq area where the rivers are. <br>  Most likely of course humans ruined the area, and GOD removed to protect the amazing life there to a safe place.<br>  <br>  Humans have been killing each other in this region for over 6000 years, cutting down trees for fires, and ships, etc - digging for minerals. That and erosion from wind and rain -  fire and time - no one today will find Eden on Earth again. (There are no maps or evidence to start to look.)<br>  <br>  The possibility of the story being a metaphor for Heaven on Earth is very high, no one can deny this. Living in a peaceful place of plenty and no fear of animals, sickness - is very strong to each human.  As recorded human history and evidence are so fleeting anything is possible. Science demands facts - and there are no facts. <br>  <br>  For a human in 2009 to think as a human 2-6000 years ago is not possible. How would one answer questions without evidence?|`|LpyEAcjeaa	The Garden of Eden represents "Shalom", or an optimal relationship with God. Everything moving away from that, namely sin, destroys that relationship leaving one barren and helpless. <br>  <br>  The garden is an attempt to relate the nature and character of God, not to give a newspaper report of actual historical events.|`|u93oneUXaa	I think the Garden of Eden is more a metaphor than a physical place.

And the fourth river is Euphrates.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Scripture is pretty clear about the location of the Garden of Eden.  It's gone.  It was taken away some time after Adam and Eve were expelled from it, most likely when the flood occurred.<br>  <br>  Its original location was between the Tigris and Euphrates river, which places it within modern-day Iraq.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	I believe in the garden of Eden, that it is real.

R8upjPu8aa	I Bow to your humbleness, as it is the adoration of gods.<br>  <br>  I put my understanding ( not insight) straight in front of you, <br>  <br>  As awareness increases, the illusion gets reduced, and more of reality is revealed. looking "FOR" "SOMETHING", Looking "AT" "SOMETHING" or for that matter the very "LOOKING" is a process spawned by duality of mind. the separation or individuality caused by the mind.<br>  <br>  hence one has to reduce the number of illusions at all times, and conceive truth in ones sacred womb of heart, and nourish it with the food of understanding, and increase the awareness ( which is the divine baby born ) , by which one should open the third eye with direct perception.<br>  <br>  than AT , FOR  , WITH , TO and all illusions disappear. these are basic illusions and disappear at final stages only, at initial stages, only number of dreams get reduced.<br>  <br>  no dream is real, and no reality of manifested world is anything more than a dream. it is scary but true.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  when you are awake you are more aware, and hence you realize what you saw in night was a dream, when you get still more aware, similarly you realize what you are seeing now as life is also a simple dream with a set of characters, and even further , you will realize that all the characters of the dream were all you yourself, your own mind spawning into all characters of dream.<br>  <br>  <br>  now i give you a guda rahasya, a great secret openly.<br>  <br>  when your mind spawns a dream, the mind creates all characters, and allocates  small minds for each character so that the character can exhibit individuality.<br>  <br>  in this cycle , continuously being spawned, today you exist as a limited mind. <br>  <br>  when the dream is over, you merge into the higher mind which spawned the dream, and similarly when that higher mind ends its dream, it again merges into its source ( this is how many life's and deaths are created  - this is the great secret i am revealing, don't take it lightly please, its time to spill this information in many places and i am doing so ) and finally you are a single unified undivided universal mind.<br>  <br>  god bless you auspicious one.

When these are truly known, then we can understand true unity.   <br>  Consciousness is the symptom of the soul, the true spiritual self.  A dead body has no consciousness due to the fact that the soul has left that body. As conscious living souls, we are part and parcel of the Supreme Soul or Supreme Consciousness from which everything is emanating. As part and parcel of that Supreme we have the same qualities as the Supreme but in different quantity. The nature of the soul is that it is eternal, full of bliss and full of knowledge. But due to contact with the material energy and having a material body, the soul has fallen into illusion and falsely accepts this temporary body to be the self. It also falsely accept a particular country to be it's home and so many people to be family and relatives. Whereas these things are all very temporary and will come to an end sooner or later.<br>  The soul must endeavor for understanding it's true nature and it's eternal relationship with the Supreme Soul. Understanding that eternal relationship and fully acting upon it, is true unity, spiritual unity, eternal unity. To the extent that we truthfully endeavor and deeply desire to understand the eternal spiritual truth and the Absolute Truth, to that extent we are becoming truly conscious, spiritually conscious. But we need to search out the soul who has reached that level of consciousness and take direction from him. <br>  To attain that state of pure consciousness, we have to be undivided and single pointed in our attempts. True unity is undivided in consciousness, otherwise the unity will not be there it will be partial.If we are in two states of consciousness and are attracted by many different things, there cannot be complete unity at any time. <br>  We have to learn to see from Whom everything is coming, in Whom it dwells, and by whom it is wound up by in the end. We have to be able to see the Supreme hand in everything. We have to see fully our position in relation to that Supreme and be acting upon it in full consciousness. We have to see everything and everyone in relation to the Supreme and act in that consciousness. Otherwise we are not in true consciousness and there will be no true unity.<br>  To the degree we realize these, that will be the degree of true consciousness and true unity.<br>  But it cannot be according to our own speculation.<br>  One must approach a self-realised soul, inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. That self-realised soul can impart the knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.<br>  I will leave it there.<br>  Take care and best wishes<br>  Much more can be said on the subject.

f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	There isn't really an easier way if you want to clear everything that needs to be resolved.<br>  <br>  As the emotions arise, throw yourself right into the middle of the feelings and try to experience them fully, however painful it is.<br>  <br>  Say in your mind, I am feeling ********, I am experiencing *******   and I willingly release it from all levels of my being.    Name the emotion and the pain you are feeling, and release it.    <br>  <br>  Once fully experienced the emotions should begin to subside.   Remember that these have been trapped for a long time, so they are going to burst out with quite a vengeance.<br>  <br>  After a session, close by reciting a releasing mantra.   <br>  <br>  "I willingly release all negativity, past and present, on all levels of my being."<br>  <br>  Repeat this 3 times.<br>  <br>  It's good for you to verbalise these things. as it sounds as if you are having the most problems with your throat chakra, which is the chakra of communication.    So to speak the releasing out loud might help to clear things better.<br>  <br>  After a session you could take a few drops of Rescue Remedy to help balance your equilibrium.|`|dFBccLExaa	What are you using to clense youe chakrs? As one way may be better than the other for you. Also, if really really painful memories and emotions are tied t the chakras, it's gonna be a painful exp. because those emotions have to be dealt with in order to become balanced. <br>  You could try getting some stones to help alleviate the pain, to make it easier for you to work through things. I know quartz tends to help, along with any of the quartz made stones (rose quartz, amethyst, citrine, etc.) <br>  You can email me if you have more questions.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I would recommend you seek a professional to help.

You could ask your doctor for a prescription for an anti-anxiety med, but that slows the progress because you loose that motivation to clear them.  I would advise, if it's so painful, that you find a teacher/therapist/guide and slow down.  Those old memories, attachments, and scripts in your head do cause pain, and purging opens them back up, like ripping a scab off of an infected sore (sorry for the ugly analogy, but what you've experienced in your past is ugly too).  I also suggest pairing your efforts with relaxation and destressing exercises; meditation, diaphragmatic breathing,  visualization of happy, pleasant things, and something that you can do that takes all of your focus, like a puzzle, video game, fun fiction book... to give your mind/body/consciousness a rest, to recuperate and allow you to go back to the purging.<br>  <br>  Buddhist/Taoist w/ chronic depression and PTSD|`|MkZC5gd6aa	If you have knots and bumps you need to see a doctor and have a cancer test.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	use softer toilet paper|`|rcCYssKYaa	What sort of diet do you eat?

I realize in the world we live in, we can not get rid of all of these items, but we can at least try to limit them.<br>  <br>  Eating fresh fruits and veggies helps clean the chakras.  As well as drinking FRESH juice.  Drink it within 20 minutes of squeezing.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend some sort of relaxation technique.  Whether it be meditation, yoga, or reading the texts of your chosen religion (for example, the bible, if you're a Christian...) or even just taking a sea salt or bubble bath.  Clearing away all of these old memories/wounds creates a lot of stress!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|bOfDpTLxaa	everything's better when you have a friend to share it with.

Unless Abel was actually the first murderer instead of Cain, Cain would not be justified under libertarian theory in murdering Abel.<br>  <br>  Libertarianism is neutral with regards to any action that does not involve an initiation of force.  Libertarianism is not libertinism (although libertine actions are compatible with libertarianism, provided that they do not involve the initiation of force).<br>  <br>  In fact, one could argue that Cain was the first statist, as he was the first person in the Bible to engage in an initiation of force.

gebIjqnWaa	Modern revelation states that Christ said meet together often and partake of the sacrament, that you may do it in remembrance of me, to the renewing of your covenants and the forgiveness of your sins. The purpose is what governs, not the ritual. God set aside one day as a day of rest, whether it is Saturday or Sunday, it doesn't make much difference. Meet the objectives and you satisfy the need.|`|lJUyhMceaa	There is no command of Jesus that the Lord's Supper should be observed "X" amount of times, or on certain days.<br>  <br>  Jesus simply said, " This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me." (1Co 11:25).<br>  <br>  Notice the phrase "as oft as ye drink it".  Jesus simply said, "when you do this, do it in rememberace of me".  <br>  <br>  So, if your Church only does it once a month, or twice a year...or once a week, there is nothing wrong with it either way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Feel free to ask you church leader "why" they do it the way they do.  But remember, there is no set rule Biblically, so if you ask, just ask to understand.<br>  <br>  And NO, you should not start a new Church.  If you do not know the Bible well enough to answer this simple question, what qualifies you to start your own Church?|`|YnGIccE8aa	If you would like to celebrate the Lord's Supper every Sunday, you should investigate the Catholic or Orthodox Church. <br>  <br>  If not -- go ahead -- what's one more Protestant splinter caused by argument over scripture?|`|RoqxGbgRaa	Jesus Himself said:<br>  <br>  23 This is in remembrance of my blood which is shed for many, and the new testament which I give unto you; for of me ye shall bear record unto all the world. <br>    24 And as oft as ye do this ordinance, ye will remember me in this hour that I was with you and drank with you of this cup, even the last time in my ministry. <br>  <br>  Jesus did not specify a day, so we should probably not be too religious about it.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	no, He said "as often as you do this, do in rememberance of me".

Gf5nMPJXaa	No not really.  I think most believers at least consciously believe.  Usually they have unexamined beliefs that are there merely to conform to social norms - but that's still a belief.  I don't think 83% of the US population only pretends to be Xian - and the voting habits of those who do show they at least act on the more socially regressive beliefs they have so I doubt it's all pretense.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	There are some that I do believe secretly in their hearts believe there is a God.

You have your opinions and your opinions are so strong that you could not understand how we couldn't see your truth. But we feel the same way. It all comes down to perspective.

I think that if they believed in a personal, present god that they can speak to and can speak to them, observes and judges, then they wouldn't behave the way they do. We all do things we shouldn't or aren't proud of when people in authority are around. They describe god as an authority figure and yet they behave just like the rest of us, I would expect to see some kind of evidence that believers behave as though they're being watched all the time and they don't <br>  <br>  I also don't think they believe in certain concepts they claim to, speaking to many christians in my life it's clear that very few of them believe that god has no favourites but that they have the personal favour of lord of the universe. Lastly, I think the majority of them DO think that certain behaviour buys salvation such as giving to the church and witnessing.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	I'm pretty sure that most Christians are just whistling past the graveyard.<br>  <br>  The fact that they cry at funerals -- when they "know" their loved ones are enjoying eternal life in paradise at the right hand of Jesus -- is the dead giveaway.<br>  <br>  If they actually had the courage of their so-called convictions, it'd be no different than if the deceased were merely on an extended vacation.|`|UtRjy7Isaa	I can't read minds, so I get to know someone through conversation in order to find out their beliefs.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that there are religious people on Y and A who pretend to know the mind of an atheist.

Mark the envelope "Personal and Confidential." Then send it via certified/registered mail, return receipt to the doctor's office. This will get the doctor to stand up and take notice. There is a chance the receptionist might get to it before the doctor does (although if she opens an envelope marked "personal and confidential," she technically is violating mail tampering laws). Follow up a few days after you send the letter to make sure the doctor got it. Too many receptionists are horribly rude. Many are overworked and take it out on everyone. If you just mention the person's rudeness in passing, the doctor will likely forget all about it (he's got a lot on his plate, too). But with a formal, official, tangible reminder -- like the letter -- it will be more likely to get followed up on.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	i agree with mary k.  mention it to your doctor.  he should have a talk with her.  she may be treating other patients poorly, too.<br>  <br>  she could also be slightly jealous of your relationship with your doc, but that's her problem.  it should not be affecting her professionalism.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	complain to the DR. he probably doesn't know she's being nasry & rude to people.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	How was she supposed to discuss your business in private when she's sitting in a wide open area in the patient waiting room?

You need to talk to the doctor about it.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Say something to the Doctor, or if there are other people at the office, like an office manager. Nobody should be rude to a patient. Sometimes an office does not accept an insurance. First of all, I'm not clear, did you call first and make an appointment? Was the appointment for you or someone else?  If you called and said what the insurance was, then the person on the phone could say "We do" or "We don't" accept the insurance. Doctor's offices should always be clear what they will and won't accept. ALso I am not clear, were you there to get a referral for a specialist, or you had been referred there? Sometimes the referring office will check and see if the the other office will accept your insurance, sometimes they leave it up to you to check.  <br>  <br>  I worked in a doctor's office, I know that mix ups about insurance can occur, but the staff and the patient should be able to talk quietly if there is a problem with insurance, or the patient has an outstanding bill or anything like that. Some offices will ask for your insurance information before you make an appointment to be sure you have the insurance and they are in the program as a provider.

And for sanctions for having to bring the motion in the first place.

For the criminal side, we have murder, genocide, an action under the RICO statutes, assault, battery, manslaughter, first degree murder (malice aforethought), infanticide.

OT4SrmDXaa	Its a horrifying place and God doesn't want anyone to go there,|`|26DoxkOBaa	It's a temporary state on a higher plane of spiritual energy which intensifies the predominately bad experiences of a previous life when soul is in a disembodied state between lives. Because it's in another dimension, the time is longer than Earth time, so it could take perhaps a short time by our time and seemed very long by spiritual time. When it's over, the soul is flooded with new desires collected from the last life, especially having to do with eating, and looks for another baby body to incarnate into along karmic connections to the mother and father. That may take some time, so a soul may stay in limbo a little while.|`|7ylYxklsaa	I think many people use it to make themselves feel better than and/or superior to other people whom they (not their God) judge as deserving of hell, oftentimes based on whether or not they like that person, not on their moral character.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	I'm not going!|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I think the most profound teachings of heaven and hell refer to physical and psychological realms of experience we can achieve in our life.

The wicked sometimes prosper, Job points out, and the virtuous often suffer, and there's no apparent moral justification for it.<br>  <br>  If we think of the bad people going to hell, however, it's less painful and infuriating to think of how successful they seem to be right now, often at our expense.<br>  <br>  As an odd example of thisk, I have an atheist friend, a radical feminist and an anarchist, who started to tell jokes about heaven and hell when Reagan was president.  She didn't believe in hell at all, but she had great fun imagining that Reagan and other conservatives were all going there.  <br>  <br>  Probably some of the conservatives were having just as much fun at the time imagining that all feminist anarchists were all hell-bound.

When they understandably rebeled he took the bulk of the roman army himself figuring he would destroy them easily--instead the bulk of the roman army and  the emperor were destroyed.  The next emperor made the mistake of coming to an agreement with the Goths and utilizing them as roman soldiers--Fellow by the name of Aldric--a goth--didn't cotton to be used for cannon fodder--and sent his roman equipped troops eventually to rome--sacked and burned it--(didn't have the manpower to hold it in a protracted war--sacking of rome being a political manuever).  So aside from all your BS hyperbole==i doubt that the US would utilize divisions of foriegn troops in the united states equipped with heavy weapons-.

So, they would link everything about the Roman empire to be.....un-Christian. <br>  <br>  Just look at your bible, all stories containing the winning of Christianity have always been linked to 'un-Christianity' of the opponents. The loss of the Christianity that is written, have always been linked to being 'not Christian enough'. And your winning is always due to the fact of being 'Christian powered' winning.<br>  <br>  Not just with Christian, but also in Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, all religions are basically relating their winning and losing just like that. Even tribal faith in Africa are doing the same thing.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question, yes, someday America will go down. Nothing is perfect, and nothing in this world is eternal. But for the moment, we should try our best to keep everything in it's place.<br>  <br>  btw, sexual immorality was not the reason for the downfall of the Roman Empire, it was pure and simply, power struggle.

Infighting, stagnation, hatred, and apathy will kill us, not lack of belief in a silly book.|`|T4AfrWBbaa	Yes, but not like the fall of Rome.  Once people in a democracy realize that they can vote to have the government support them financially and provide education/health care/military protection/etc. for free, then the economy is destroyed and so is the democracy.  That, plus those who earn their money through investments and business owners.  They will do whatever they need to do to keep their system going, which includes taking their investments and labor overseas.  This will eliminate the middle class and cause a chasm of social status - as in many countries we'll have the mega rich and the mega poor.  <br>  <br>  Caligula's fall wasn't his behavior, it was his insistance that everyone recognize and treat him as a god.  People realized he was insane and reacted.  His sexual behavior was a result of his mental illness and his obsession for having power and glory the easy way instead of earning it.  Sexuality in general has never ended a civilization or culture.  You have Christian blinders on.  Many cultures and civilizations tolerated and even believed homosexuals and the ambiguously gendered as divinely connected, making them shamans, spiritual leaders, and guides of their spiritual pursuits.  Some even believe that orgasm is divine and union with god.<br>  <br>  If sexuality plays any role in the destruction of a government, civilization, or culture, it's the intolerance of those different from one's self that will be the demise, not the sexuality itself.|`|aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Every society has within its germination the seeds of its own destruction.<br>  <br>  No matter how noble or idealistic the basis of any civilisation, other people come along who begin to corrupt that basis, trying to move it away to what they would prefer. That is one cause of its corruption, then destruction. But if a civilisation was based on, say, the principles of the free market, then eventually the flaws in that very system would work through and that civilisation would crumble as the free market idea was shown to be false. That's because no system is perfect. The destruction of Communism can be traced back to the fundamental flaws in the concept of Communism. Great theory, but bad practice. Why? Because any theory that does not include the greed and selfishness of sinners is a flawed system. That's what God's word warns us about. We ignore that, at our cost.|`|iY6GQsRUaa	The entire premise of your question FAILS.<br>  <br>  Meteorology is not causally linked to immorality. <br>  <br>  There are three main things that will be the downfall of this country; pay attention because this is very valuable advice, given to you for free (you have to pay Lush Rimjob hundreds of millions of dollars to give you bad advice).<br>  <br>  1.

It happened to all previous empires, it will happen to the US.  This doesn't have anything to do with sexuality.<br>  <br>  If you are implying that God destroyed the empire for it's sins...the US, Roman, British, Ottoman, and whatever other huge empire, was founded on HORRIBLE atrocities and sins.  Stop trying to link your beliefs with history.  If God had a hand in any of the events, that would mean that free will does not exist.|`|ojHFFpcBaa	The Roman Empire was a conglomeration of peoples held together by force and economic interest. With a declining population and the monasteries attracting much of the cream of the population, Rome was forced to bind people to their professions. The empire eventually reached the point of taxing its remaining productive population so greatly (because monks and nuns are unproductive members of society) that these people were no longer willing to support the system. It had nothing to do with sexual immorality. In fact, by the time the western empire fell, Christianity had been adopted as the state religion.

Hence, my concern.<br>  <br>  The fundamentalist right of the USA is in danger of bringing the good name of Christ into disrepute. They are the ones who seem to be up to their necks in saying Bible prophecies will result in this, that and the next thing happening to Israel, and that Christians must support Israel (no matter what it does). They are not actually the ones proclaiming salvation by faith alone. Such ones seem to be a minority. They are the ones proclaiming salvation by pursuing a certain political agenda. They are the ones who are wreaking havoc because they are not pointing to Christ Jesus. They think they are. They are not.<br>  <br>  The issue has nothing to do with good works. Only humility will bring down God's blessing. Materialistic prosperity actually works against a nation repenting of its pride. The one good thing about the present financial disaster breaking upon nations whose trust is in money is that they might waken up to the course of disaster they have been pursuing in bowing at Mammon's altar.|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	The U.S. is hurting because of a small group of people... some are christians.. some aren't... they ALL are greedy and evil... some are pushing their religions in violent ways that hurt many people.. their weapons are many.. such as government, laws made that take away people's rights etc.  Sometimes they do their violence through society in the form of shunning or some such thing that causes emotional damage to those who don't believe what they do.  Or there are a few who do physical violence and even cause death.   They use religion to justify and escape judgment to do the evil that they do.

However, while I'm alive I do think living for my own selfish bag of skin alone is pretty meaningless. <br>  <br>  If I don't contribute some of my spark of life to some bigger purpose that transcends my individual welfare, and that stands a chance of outlasting me, life begins to seem lonely and terrifying.<br>  <br>  But when I tutor a child, or give to a panhandler or a worthy charity, or try to contribute to the preservation of knowledge or the health of my society or the global ecosystem, I feel that I am part of something meaningful. <br>  <br>  How about you?

67q4ElJtaa	Your questions show legitimate concerns. Keep in mind that if in fact these miraculous healings occur, or seem to occur, does not in fact validate them as having divine backing. Jesus Christ warned his apostles about this saying, "False Christs and false prophets willa rise ans will give great signs and wonders so as to meislead, if possible, even the chosen ones." Also, depending on where these faith healings are performed, some "psychic healers" say their cures have nothing to do with religion. Take into consideration the cost of services and the rate of success. Jesus said, "You received free, give free" and Paul said about Peter's healing "They would one and all be cured."|`|yzRHAWNhaa	Well if Jesus didn't make us, He wouldn't be able to heal us.<br>  <br>  Deity of Jesus Christ<br>  Joh:1:1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>  Joh:1:2: The same was in the beginning with God.<br>  Joh:1:3: All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. <br>  <br>  M'r:10:27: And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.? ? ? ?|`|j7hxpwTdaa	We all go through suffering and Jesus can help stop it yes praying to him you will get help, but sometimes the suffering won't end... until you go to heaven.<br>  But there must be some explanation for that these people must have done a lot in there lives or are really good followers of jesus or something.|`|FgdJpfiVaa	yes jesus does heal the blind and deaf.<br>  back then in "bible times" you read that he freed a man for lepersy and blindess and demons. today he cant really come down and heal a man by his touch....<br>  thats why its called praying<br>  and having faith|`|Yi5eyoNxaa	Its just a hoax, if anyone could be healed like actually healed, wouldnt it be in the news and if somone was really sick in the hospital wouldnt they just take them to church?|`|VELnLnIKaa	sure its true thats why there are no blind deaf people in the world lol|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	satan can perform miracles too.

bZo5Z53Uaa	Only Hindu women who are married wear a red dot. It is called "Tilak". It is also called "Bindi" if it is a sticker. It is called "Kum kum", if it is made from red powder.<br>  <br>  This red dot is a sign of Hindu married women. It is a tradition. It also prevents looking men from casting eyes on them for marriage, since red dot indicates they are married and not available. Widows do not wear the red dot. Young unmarried girls do not put "kum kum", though they might wear a small red dot or other color. It is a Hindu tradition. Many people believe that a red dot makes women look beautiful and auspicious. So, it is also a form of female decoration (make-up).<br>  <br>  There are some other theories, which say the red dot made from suitable material, and applied between the brows, improves concentration, increases peace of mind and improves devotion. Even in some meditations, people are encouraged to concentrate attention between the brows.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Thankyou, I am not a Hindu though, although many of my friends were hence they related many things to me!|`|Izn1ye9Raa	It's a bindi.

lJUyhMceaa	This is a great thing to be setting around thinking about.  Sure beats many other things people "think" about.<br>  <br>  So, after the seven year tribulation Christ Jesus will come to earth and rule for 1000 years.  This is called the Millenium.  After that, the Bible tells us that satan will be released from hell for a short time to gather together an army to come against God.  Of course this fails and satan is cast into the lake of fire forever.  After that, this heaven and earth that we know now will be destroyed, and God will create a new one.<br>  <br>  Then, the "New Jeruselem" where God will live with man for eternity will come down and rest upon the earth.  That will be the start of eternity.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I searched and found this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bible-knowledge.com/New-Heaven-And-New-Earth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-knowledge.com/New-Heave...</a><br>  <br>  Yes it sounds fantastic!

There are a number of prophesies that has yet to occur before that event happens. They will not be accomplished before 2012. One is that the <br>  Anti-Christ will rule the whole earth before the rapture occurs and Christ comes. (The guy who will have the number 666 on his head.) Another is that one third of the world will be destroyed. Even whole cities will be without inhabitant. When Christ returns he will cleanse the whole earth of evil and reign one thousand years.There's no such thing as an old heaven or a new heaven. It will be new to people who make it there, but the rewards of Heaven never changes. It will be wonderful to live one thousand years on Earth when Satan is bound and evil is done away with. That might be what some people are calling a new Heaven, however, it won't be new because in mellinia it has occured in other worlds many times. The Earth will not be translated until after Christ has been our King for one thousand years, then we will be judged and take our place occording to the restoration or the rewards for our works whether they be good or evil. It will be a happy time for the faithful but not so great for the sinners.|`|eDAg5OnTaa	From my understanding of the bible, I think a "new" heavenly government was already established up there the instance Satan and his legion of demons were cast out of heaven and down to earth. The only thing people are waiting for now is the earth. I'm going on the Lord's prayer in Matthew something where it tells people to pray for God's will to be done on Earth as it has been done in heaven. After all, the bible does say that the, Meek shall inherit the earth." To make a long story short, I think the new heaven was established once satan was kicked out of heaven. Heaven was cleansed therefore making it new again. Just my thoughts.

Maybe this is the Pastor's honest opinion or maybe the new person has done a great selling job not to mention a little brown nosing. I have worked with people who constantly let the employer know what a wonderful job they are doing for the employer and what a great guy he is. In any event I might ask the Pastor did I do something wrong or is there some way I could have done my job better? He may want to avoid the issue. Especially if he is completely in the wrong but then again he may have a tip or two in how I might improve myself. And I might start the conversation off saying hey ya know what you said the other day/moment/month kind of hurt. Again he may be embarrassed and defensive and may not even want to deal with it. Hopefully is he is at all humble he will hear the person and respond. And even if he doesn't  just maybe he will think twice before spouting off the next time. (I am the kind of person who wants to be a more proficient worker and person just telling me I am doing a crappy job isn't helpful. Instruct me how to improve myself). I have also worked with allot of people who think they are the best worker around and everyone else is lousy). Those are the ones I find hard to take. (One last thought) Just imagine if someone thought you said something or implied something by what you did say. If you valued you this would you not rather they came to you and ask you rather than just avoid you from now on. If you were taken out of context you will be saving a friendship and a person's feeling. But if you were wrong it will give you the opportunity to ask forgiveness and grow.|`|t88527U1aa	Don't believe he meant anything by it maybe just trying to build the other person up.

He certainly isn't taking into account the well being of the souls he's supposedly commissioned to feed. Christ told Paul to feed his sheep. He said it several times for emphasis. This pastor sounds like he's serving vinegar where milk should be applied and road kill in place of aged beef. If a pastor is more interested in puffing up his own ego instead of doing the Lords work, keeping a flock together and feeding them; they may as well let a wolf in through the sheep gate? Let the Lord guide you dear. God Bless.
AA12383652	If the stake president really told them that then he was really wrong.<br>  He had no business telling them that.<br>  <br>  My cousin recently got married by the Bishop at the church and they had their reception at the church right afterwards.<br>  <br>  If you ever hear a Bishop or Stake President say something that just sounds a little off then go ask another Bishop if its really true because sometimes you get a Bishop or Stake President that just doesnt always know what they are talking about.<br>  Remember, these are guys that are just pulled out of the wards.

HbQmDGb6aa	I think it is bad form. I have been asked out a few times at work (as a barista at Starbucks, no less) and it's very awkward for me. Coworkers gossip, for one thing. Another is just that being put on the spot in front of so many people leaves no door to say no without making everyone (you, me, and audience) uncomfortable. At Starbucks, the barista has lots of things she needs to be doing when no customers are in the store, so the more time you take up of hers, the less she has to do her job - some fellow baristas might get a little bitter. <br>  Try to find out when she gets off work and ask her then, or slip her your number discreetely. If you absolutely must (I strongly recommend against it) ask her then, wait til no one is in the store. It should go without saying that this is not something you do when someone is waiting in line for her!<br>  As the woman on the other end, it is flattering, but uncomfortable. Introduce yourself, then try to save anything beyond customer interaction for after her shift.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	I think it's perfectly appropriate if her place of employment is the only opportunity you have to ask her.  How else would you do it, if you only know her through your customer/employee relationship?  HOWEVER...I wouldn't advise it if there are other people around.  It's not exactly 'inconsiderate', but it should be private.  Also, asking in front of other people puts YOU in the position of being embarrassed if she declines the offer...rejects you outright...or gets angry that you even approached her at work.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	depends<br>  how well do you know her?<br>  Is it busy? (do you care by holding up the line for something like that?)<br>  Do care about a public rejection?|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	If she has to deal directly with a lot of customers and coworkers all the time, then just calling her and asking her to call you back when she has a chance to speak privately is good.  Then when she does call back, you ask her out.  Otherwise, especially if it's your first date, she might blow you off simply because she has more pressing things to deal with at the moment.  If you've been dating for a while, then a quick call to say "meet me at 6 at X restaurant, ok?" is sufficient and don't expect a lot of chit chat.  She can be discrete still by simply saying "ok" if all is right with her, or she can say "that won't work" or "how about 7?" or "make it 6 at Z instead" without having to disclose a lot to the other people.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I wouldn't say it's inconsiderate but it may be difficult for you to ask because she is working and you don't want to disturb her or get her yelled at for not doing her tasks while she's still "on the clock". If you know of a time where it's less busy at her place of employment, stop by then and ask her. :)|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Jot down a note on the napkin and ask her out.<br>  <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|S8pIwxpwaa	I think it's a very common practice. A nice looking lady being nice to me? I'll ask her out!<br>  <br>  What we tend to forget is that they're paid to have a good attitude, and that they generally treat you even better if there's a tip involved. <br>  <br>  From our point of view, they like us! They really really like us! <br>  <br>  Best way to do it is write down your number on a paper or napkin, with a short note "let's go out? call me". That accomplishes a few things: 1) It relieves the tension of needing an immediate answer, 2) You don't have to SAY anything that others may hear, 3) It puts the ball in her court to call or not call based on how she really feels.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, but be realistic :)|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Speaking for myself because it has happened to me more than once. I find it really uncomfortable and I am shy. One guy that asked me out called me. He asked me out over the phone when I was at work. I liked that method the best. I knew who he was. He came in every day with his dad. They worked up the street. He said that he thought of waiting for me after work and showing up with flowers or something but decided that I might be put off with that kind of display. He paid attention. I like that! <br>  <br>  Be thoughtful. Be considerate. Try to read her to judge what you think she might prefer. Is she shy or is she outgoing?|`|lBKfmRWCaa	If others will see or overhear then I would say no.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	I wouldn't go that route. It puts her in a bad position and you could be in for the embarrassment of your life. I once saw a French movie where two people were in a subway sitting across from each other and couldn't really talk. The guy then wrote the following on a piece of paper and handed it to the woman he liked:<br>  <br>  "Would you do me the honor of having dinner with me? (please circle one)"<br>  <br>  A. No, I'm married or have a boyfriend<br>  B. No, I'm simply not interested<br>  C. Not sure<br>  D. Yes<br>  <br>  The woman circled D. I thought that was pretty cool and will definitely try it one day, if I'm ever single again.....good luck!

It is Central to who you are. It is YOU.<br>  <br>  You can't deny who you are, merely out of respect for someone else's beliefs  OR because you are a house guest. <br>  <br>  1st:   Why would a Christian be a house guest in a Satanist's house?  IF they care about their beliefs,  they would avoid that situation to begin with. <br>  <br>  2nd:  Why would the person at the house make the guest feel obligated to "respect" them to THAT degree, even to the point of completely violating their beliefs?<br>  <br>  3rd: SINCE Satanists claim to want people to be TRUE to their feelings, and believe, rather then an evil boogie man,  Satan just means "opposer" or "one who opposes"  -- Why wouldn't they aplaud the Christian for opposing the opposer and being true to their beliefs by NOT participating or worshipping Satan ???  Another wards, I think they would support the Christian, say "Bravo!"<br>  <br>  4th: It is a Christian principle that a person can not TRULY serve 2 masters and that there should be NO god above God...this includes making "things" a higher priority in your life, like money, sex, power, etc. -- So putting anything above God, even for a day, is a sin and violates Christian Principles. <br>  The Christian principle of "Render to Caesar, what is Caesar's"  doesn't apply here either, because the 1st principle that one can not serve 2 maters nor put a god above THY God,  STILL applies,  so therefore we can give to Caesar what is Caesar's and do as a Roman when in Rome,  WHEN it doesn't violate our conscience OR our belief in God because those are PERSONAL beliefs,  part of who we are.

Lx5nEpT0aa	The giants are the Nephilim, or those offspring of the marriage between the fallen angels, and the daughters of men. Who could that be, you may ask? The progeny of any sexual relationship is children, or descendants. These children, or offspring from the angelic relationships were misfits. They were deformed giants.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:37 "But as the days of Noe were so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."<br>  <br>  This "Noe", is the Greek form of the Hebrew word, "Noah". These final days of this earth will be exactly as it was in the days that Noah was on the earth, just prior to his entering into the ark. To find out what happened in that day, we must go to Genesis 6. What was it like in those days?<br>  <br>  Genesis 6:1, 2; "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them," [1] "That the sons of God [the fallen angels] saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose." [2]<br>  <br>  These angels left their first estate, as Jude writes in Jude 4, and married flesh women of flesh man. From this marriage came the offspring of this evil relationship. These offspring were called; in Strong's Hebrew dictionary # 5303, and 5307, "Nephilim, or the Giants. These angels are created beings, and thus are called the "sons of God".<br>  <br>  Genesis 6:4-5; "There were giants [Nephilim] in the earth in those days; and also f=after that, when the sons of God [fallen angels] came in unto the daughters of men, they bare [children, is added by the translators] to them, the same became might men which were of old, men of renoun."<br>  <br>  So we see that the fallen angels left their habitation of the heavenlies, and came to earth and mated with women and a new for of life was formed, and evil form defiant against God. Man and angels are very similar, for the Israelites were sustained on angels food in the wilderness, and angels ate of mans food, as we saw when they sat with both Abraham, and Lot, and ate. <br>  <br>  The whole reason for the flood of Noah's time was to destroy the misfits that had invaded the earth, and inbred with women. The reason for God saving Noah is recorded in Genesis 6:8, 9; "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." [8] "These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God." [9]<br>  <br>  In the Hebrew manuscripts, "perfect" is the word "tamin", or without blemish, with respect to pedigree. What this is telling us is that all of flesh corrupted except for Noah's family. The word in the Hebrew for "walked", means Noah walked habitually [continually] with God. <br>  <br>  Are you starting to get the picture, these angels are going to return to earth in the last days, and do the same as they did in Noah's day. Strange events are starting to come to light, and the governments around the world are allowing sightings and events to go out to the public, where before they would kill and discredit those who saw the events. We are very close to the time when they will become as common as man, and be accepted, and this can happen because the Kenites now control the one world system.<br>  <br>  Jesus is telling them that it is not going to be any difference now, as it was in Noah's day, for you are going to have the fallen angels down their with you then. When Satan is caste to the earth, all of Satan's many fallen angels will be caste out with him. This is recorded in Revelation 12:7-9; "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, [7] "And prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven." [8] "And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." [9] <br>  <br>  What will the people of the earth be doing at this time?|`|GMmmbLGRaa	God sent judgment of the Flood in the days of Noah. The strange events recorded in Genesis 6 are referring to fallen angels procreating weird hybrid offspring with human women-known as the Nephilim. This was far more than simply a historical issue, the unique events leading to the Flood are a prerequisite to understanding the prophetic implications of our Lord's predictions regarding His Second Coming.  This is believed to have happened both before the Flood and after the flood.  In Israel at the time of David, and before this when the Hebrews were scouting the land - there were tribes of these Nephilim - Goliath the giant of Gath is one example.  Early Church fathers also understood this to be the case.  It appears that these fallen angels were active all over the world.   These bizarre giants living on the earth are also echoed in the legends and myths of nearly every ancient culture.  The ancient Greeks, the Egyptians, the Hindus, the South Sea Islanders, the American Indians, and most all the others have these legends. <br>  <br>  Satan put this plan to interrupt Abraham's "seed into motion, as soon as it was made known that the Seed of the Woman (Christ) was to come through ABRAHAM.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Nephilim has different translations depending on the religion.  Some religions describe them as giants, others describe them as high officials.<br>  <br>  The high official definition makes more sense because the flood killed all of the existing Nephilim and then the Nephilim show up again later.|`|Cnhbk6Weaa	Verily like a whale.|`|XKzUsb7zaa	Nephilim are celestrial beings.

This limits the possibilities....<br>  <br>  1) if the "sons of God" are "angels" and Nephilim are a particular "race"<br>  1a) Noah or someone in his family was a Nephil, and the pre-flood Nephilim are the same race as the post-flood Nephilim<br>  1b) angels mated with human women after the flood producing the post-flood Nephilim, but it was not recorded in Scripture<br>  <br>  2) "Nephilim" is simply a word used to describe any tribe of very tall humans.  Such tribes existed historically in several locations (Scandinavia, Africa, Eastern Asia, etc.)<br>  <br>  Personally, I find 2 the most likely.  1a seems unlikely because the pre-flood Nephilim appear to be associated with the wickedness that caused God to destroy them, and no one in Noah's family is identified in Scripture as a Nephil.  1b seems unlikely simply because there is no post-flood Scriptural record of "sons of God" fooling around with earth girls - which seems like a pretty important event to omit entirely.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviewx.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviewx.com</a>|`|u7LSohRyaa	I used to think that this was angels who bred with women but now I'm not so sure that this is even possible. If God implanted Mary with his seed and that produced Jesus then it seems possible. It might just be symbolic. Sons of God does not necessarily mean angels.

AA11923447	Some Protestant churches do not observe it at all. Other Protestant groups, such as the Episcopal Church, do observe it. I've been to Episcopalian Good Friday services, and they are very close to the standard Roman Catholic observance. There are prayers and Scripture readings; in some churches, the crosses are draped in black, and the altar is bare (the altar is stripped the day before, on Maundy Thursday). It is a very solemn occasion.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	they double their onslaught of insults on Catholics.|`|B6r56Nr7aa	Many Protestant communities hold special services on this day as well. In the German Lutheran tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, this was the most important holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected. Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of Holy Communion on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive Holy Communion, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the St. Matthew Passion by Lutheran Johann Sebastian Bach. Mid-20th century Lutheran liturgical practice moved away from Holy Communion celebrated on Good Friday, and among the major North American Lutheran bodies today, Holy Communion is not celebrated on Good Friday, but rather on Maundy Thursday. Moravians hold a Lovefeast on Good Friday as they receive Holy Communion on Maundy Thursday. The Methodist Church also commemorates Good Friday with a service of worship, often based on the Seven Last Words from the Cross.[32][33]<br>  <br>  Some Baptist, Pentecostal, many Sabbatarian and non-denominational churches do not celebrate Good Friday, instead observing the Crucifixion on Wednesday to coincide with the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover Lamb (which Christians believe is an Old Testament pointer to Jesus Christ). A Wednesday Crucifixion of Jesus Christ allows for Christ to be in the tomb (heart of the earth) for three days and three nights as he told the Pharisees he would be (Matthew 12:40), rather than two nights and a day if he died on Friday.|`|xo1fabj6aa	We tend not to as a specific day.

He doesn't explain why infinity is impossible.  He just says it is, in the premise(there would be no first mover) and again in the conclusion(this cannot go on for infinity).<br>  <br>  <br>  post hoc, ergo propter hoc is not really in here because he "simply means that things are changing"... that's too broad.<br>  <br>  it's also not a problem that God doesn't have a mover... Aquinas makes it clear that what he is arguing is that something needs to have BEEN the very first.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: yeah, but aquinas didn't know about newton's first law, so... he couldn't have been talking about it exactly, right?  plus, newton's laws of motion are about physics.  God (who is in Aquinas's chain) defies physics.<br>  <br>  <br>  He shouldn't have ruled out that the universe might be infinite, always having had existed and not in need of a first cause.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but you said he simply meant that things are changing... <br>  this shouldn't be tied to physics per se.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hey, look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmologica...</a><br>  <br>  There is a section called "Objections and Counterarguments" which you'd find useful.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Special Pleading -- "The rules don't apply to MY God."<br>  <br>  Also, Assuming the Answer -- it takes as a given the very thing it needs to prove: that something can move without being moved, and that it must therefore be HIS particular version of God, as opposed to Zeus, or Odin, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster...|`|0k8ZPfx2aa	I suppose the Big Bang could have been the original perceptible mover, then we are right back to God as the mover before that mover.

Then says God does not have a mover. This is an illogical classfication. If God is anything, even a psychological abstraction, then a proposition can still point to it.

If you subtittue "the big bang" for "another"--the arguement is equally as valid--and in doing utilizing the St. Aquinis arguement therefore can be utilized to substantiate the "big bang" and absence of a deity.  The arguement is equally valid either way and therefore doesnt qualify as a logically reasoned proof of one or the other.  It's a variation of the complexity needs a creator arguement--but neglects the opposing view that at the big bang the universe was in a maximum energy minimum entropy state--in thermodynamics energy allows for local ordering (example you use energy to order silicon into integrated circuits and computers--you've accomplished local ordering but the decrease in entropy required to yield the energy to order those bits makes it overall  a process which results in more disorder).  Thus the same arguement can be made (since in thermodynamics they are state arguements) that local ordering doesnt require anything but 1). energy is consumed (work is done) to decrease entropy locally and 2).  the overall entropy of the system must increase.  (you can have local ordering on planet earth--plants converting carbon dioxide to complex sugars).  This local ordering is driven by sunlight--energy--however the increase in entropy in the sun itself that creates the light that drives local ordering is so much greater that the overall process results in increased disorder in the whole sun'earth system.

Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.<br>  02. Wiccan’s are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.<br>  03. Wiccan’s are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.<br>  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.<br>  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans don’t practice magick.<br>  06. Wiccan’s show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).<br>  07. Wicca’s ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").<br>  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.<br>  09. Wiccan’s more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps out.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|7ylYxklsaa	A nature-based faith that is generally a reconstruction of European Pre-Christian Paganism.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca</a> <br>  <br>  also try: www.about.com/wicca<br>  <br>  It is a nature based - faith traditions.

Meaning you consider yourself one even though you don't know what it is?  That's an way of labeling yourself.<br>  <br>  Wicca is a 20th century, polytheistic religion.  Rituals generally center upon a patron god and goddess.  Wiccans view the spiritual and physical worlds as intimately connected: learning about one helps you learn about the other.  Rituals also generally involve the Platonic elements of spirit, fire, air, water and earth.  Wicca draws on a variety of influences including Celtic holidays, Greek and Roman mystery religions, the magic of the Golden Dawn, and Romantic ideals, along with modern concepts such as gender equality (and equality in general).<br>  <br>  More info<br>  <a href="http://wicca.timerift.net/wiccans.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://wicca.timerift.net/wiccans.shtml</a>|`|celVUtGeaa	i'm not going to go to far into it because it's actualy against the rules for us as wiccans to try and force people into our religion. but i will tell you this we are a nature based religion who believe strongly in balance, we have a god and godess who are of equal significance and we believe that the moon has alot of power. for more info check out this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.paganfed.org/pagan-wicca.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.paganfed.org/pagan-wicca.php</a>|`|LUiiAlsJaa	wicca is new age Christianity

That sounds dangerous to me.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	If it prevents them from seeking medical treatment, it can hurt them a lot. People need to recognize mental illness.

Some of what was seen way back when is they had no idea of the psychological disorders we have today. Example Jesus healed a boy who would have fits and throw himself into the fire. It appears to be an episode to something like epilepsy. Now the demoniac like Legion who Jesus expelled into pigs was true possession. So the need for proof is to seperate from real and medical problem.The danger although sometimes physical like japanese businessman said some dangers are psychological.  Example (in which I have seen, the event that is) stupid Ministers in a deliverance service claimed a gay man had a demon in him making him homosexual, and this "possessed" person is sincere about being delivered. They go through the motions, and for a week or 2 goes by and he starts getting the feelings for men again. This person has the danger of feeling that he's not worthy because the exorcism didn't work, more often then most the Minister will pin the blame on the possessed saying they didn't have enough faith.  Which tears the person further and further away from Gods love. And truth be told Biblically, many of Jesus's healing's were not to the sicks faith but those who brought them before Jesus, so technically it was the Ministers lack of faith not the lost. What I don't understand is why the dramatics, Jesus used just a word not the drama, we just need to use the name of Jesus not a dog and pony show.

(1 Peter 3:7)<br>  <br>  In referring to women as "weaker" Peter was not implying that women are emotionally or mentally weaker. Such a view would not be in agreement with the Bible's expressions regarding women. Rather, Peter was evidently refering to physical traits, men and women being different in physical structure, with men generally posessing more physical strength. His comment also implied that men are weak as well; women, weaker. It seems that he calls attention to this difference in order to foster respect for women. <br>  <br>  When Peter writes "in like manner" the context indicates that Peter was directing husbands to deal with their wives "in like manner" to Christ, imitating his loving example. Christ put others' interests ahead of his own preferences. He was interested in their spiritual and physical welfare, and took their limitations into consideration. To dwell "according to knowledge" a husband needs knowledge of Christ's example, as well as of his wife's needs, strengths, feelings, dislikes, and limitations. Paul wrote to the Ephesians "Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it. In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it" - Ephesians 5:25, 28, 29.<br>  <br>  Peter also directs a Christian husband to "assign [his wife] honor". A Christian husband is head of his family. (Ephesians 5:22, 23) But, rather than being a dictator, he also takes the lead in showing honor. (Romans 12:10)<br>  <br>  So, a Christian husband who imitates Christ would consider his wife's feelings about where they live, as well as her needs, limitations, strengths, weaknesses, and dislikes and not think solely of his own preferences.|`|s3YuchHoaa	know that you moving to a warmer climate doesn't depend upon your husband.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The Lord sent Abraham to the land flowing with milk and honey. <br>  <br>  So the Bible supports moving to a good place that is good for you  :)|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Get a great paying job in a warmer climate.|`|cbtKJFNvaa	Cut him off until he agrees to the move.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	say you had a dream where god demanded you to move to fl and hurricanes are waiting for you :-))|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	Give him the "Cold" shoulder!<br>  <br>  Lol, I love my puns.|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	Send him a post card from south beach .... does it every time|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Refuse him SEX!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, wait....<br>  <br>  That's right...

So I just go outside with everyone else so I can have some kind of break.<br>  <br>  A lot of people to this so some did start smoking but I didn't.

AA11989753	God has a plan for EVERY child/person in this world regardless of what the circumstances are surrounding the way they arrived. I am sure I could come up with quite a few famous people who came into this world by way of rape or other horiffic circumstances. The point is that our bodies are NOT our "own." As so many people mistakenly think they are. <br>  <br>  "For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's."<br>  <br>  Romans 14:8 (KJV)<br>  <br>  Louis Braille<br>  --------------<br>     ?Louis Braille (1809-1852) invented the system of raised dots which<br>  form letters for the visually impaired to read.<br>  Louis was blinded in an accident at the age of 4. He was sent to one<br>  of the first schools for blind boys in Paris, where they were taught<br>  simple skills to help them earn a living without begging. Without<br>  being able to read, it was difficult for blind people to have much<br>  education.<br>  <br>  What  If Louis's mother would have aborted him? Then countless many people would be without the blessing this man brought to the world through his disability.  <br>  <br>  What about all the babies that have been MURDERED throughout history because of sexual irresponsiblity?  Don't you think many of them by now may have come up with cures for cancer?  Will it be okay for the government to start "doing away" with old people because they become "useless" in society?  Would it then be okay to kill  maybe your Mother and grandparents?  You don't think it could happen?  Oh, it could.<br>  <br>  We wouldn't want to leave out Socrates would we? what if he had been aborted?   Your life probably would never have been the same.<br>  <br>  Socrates<br>  (470 to 399 B.C.)<br>  This Classical Greek philosopher made important and lasting contributions in ethics and the fields of epistemology and logic|`|26DoxkOBaa	That is a good analogy, BTW. I would say that it's the woman's decision because it's her body and the state or a religion has no right to think that it has more right than the woman. Then there is the matter of karma, though, which is an inescapable law of return from every action you commit or don't commit, sort of like the universe's law, or God's law, on automatic.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	I find this description of pregnancy really hurtful and upsetting, actually. I can see arguing for a woman's right to choose from the standpoint of "Abortion is never a good thing, but a woman should have the right to decide".. ESPECIALLY in the case of rape, it's a completely reasonable argument. But simply demeaning the amazing beauty of pregnancy is just hurtful to women in general and divisive.|`|qbelhflAaa	Ahem.

P1Sl55Coaa	I had an atheist once say that if God came down and grabbed our aircraft and shook it, he would believe.  Well, if that actually happened, he would say that I drugged him or that it was an alien or a secret military weapon.  Of course, God won't do this, because there is already enough evidence all around us.  So many animals that defy evolution, and had to be designed.  The fact that the world doesn't run into other planets, and the Earth is obviously designed for life.  The odds of that happening by random chance are so far off that you have to be pretty gullible to believe it.  I do see evidence for evolution, but the evidence for God is so much stronger.  You have to be deluded to believe that God doesn't exist.|`|14JVQP9Paa	Prophesy could be evidence, but it's not really conclusive.<br>  <br>  Something unnatural happening, ie. against the laws of physics, would be evidence of the supernatural, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's God.<br>  <br>  The Bible is our source of knowledge about God, yet the Bible has so many contradictions... I just don't know where a person could find any ground to state that God is even possible.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	I feel there can not be evidence. Every person of any faith always says they feel god in them, or something to that effect. I have this argument with my mother all the time. She says she sees a sunrise and she sees god. I see a sunrise and I see the earth turning to face the sun and the light refracts off of gases in the atmosphere. But the best part is that this sunrise is beautiful to both of us. I feel if I say 2+2+2=6 and you say 2*3=6 we are both right. When you get to heaven and meet your maker will you say you spent most of your life trying to convert atheist into believers or helping people no matter race religion or creed. I feel god would appreciate the latter. <br>  <br>  As far as proof that atheists would believe- God, you will need to either send god to there door step to say hi. Or come up with a true mathematical equation to prove the existence of god. Besides that you really can't do much with something that can not be proven or disproven.|`|3K51tgQWaa	Just an appearance by him on Leno or something. Hell, a smile and a wave while wearing a name tag would work.|`|K1EZh63Yaa	The perfect "evidence" would for God to come and to speak to me face to face.<br>  <br>  I feel that you will say "but how would you know it's God instead of an impostor?" Well Jesus did it to Paul on the road to Damascus and Paul at that moment was persecuting Christians until he obviously felt the power of Jesus.  So, if God really wanted to, he could appear and w/ His infinite power be able to convince and if he couldn't, then He must not have power over all.|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	I can't come up with specifications for evidence because no one has put forth complete parameters of what a god is or what it can do.<br>  <br>  You can't give evidence for what you can't define.|`|3J6VMkr1aa	The more you study humans and compare human being and other living things the more firm will be your believe on the existence of God.

There are lots of different possible definitions.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Any proof at all would be something. There is more external evidence for the lost continent of Atlantis than for Jesus or the invisible sky fairy.<br>  <br>  You people have been saying such dross for centuries about having proof. What is this proof you are talking about. A single example would do,... anything.<br>  <br>  If you are going to come up with wild assertions that there is an external invisible sky fairy called God, then have the decency to produce some hard evidence instead of saying there is something wrong with our thinking. <br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	THERE IS ZERO ZERO, ZERO - EVIDENCE FOR ANY GOD WHATSOEVER!!!<br>  <br>  Where is this "GOD"?<br>  <br>  Paul, Mohammad, Joseph Smith, Buddha - they experienced GOD?

Is He anti-matter? Can He be carbon-dated? Does He emit X, Gamma or UV rays? Does He emit radio frequencies? Is He Light or like Light? (And the quotation of 1 John 1:5 in rebuttal would be out of context because then the assessment would be that God is literally photon energy which would infer that He was created from the Bang that caused the Universe and He is less powerful than the super-density of a Black Hole, since not even Light (photon energy or electromagnetic radiation, i.e., visible light) can escape it's gravitational pull once it passes the event horizon). So Is God a force like Gravity that He can be felt? <br>  <br>  So, What IS God? God is Spirit (Ruwach) John 4:24 ... but of what essence is the Spirit?  God Lives in Heaven, but where is that?<br>  It is not a physical place that we can test, is it? <br>  The Universe has no edge and it has no centre. Yet it continues to expand and contract. The Universe is material and all of that which is finite and in it leaves a mark by which it can be tested. If Heaven is of the supernatural and outside the finite into the infinite, how exactly does one go about testing that?<br>  <br>  If He exists only in the consciousness and sentience of man, then it is quite possible that He be imaginary? OR is that in itself the greatest evidence that we have as of yet? Rene Descartes said, "I think, therefore I AM"  So If sentient beings think of God is that indicative and evidentiary of His Existence? Essentially, "We think, therefore HE IS"? If Yes, then what of the other imagined plethora of mythological beings of long dead cultures?  Is Aphrodite a god then? Does she exist or is she a work of fiction and of the imaginations of men? What of Apollo Thor and Baldr, Loki and Nike, Ra, Osiris, Hades, Ares, Isis ad infinitum?  Therefore our thoughts of God cannot be weighed as the only evidence of His existence since the imaginations and desires of men have created gods for themselves that never were tangible or real.<br>  <br>  DNA is SO intricate that it could be attributed to intelligent design, but is God then smiling back and waving from amino acids and peptide bonds? Are RNA molecules containing triplet codons actually spelling out GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD in the AAA, ACC, ACA, CAA, CCA?<br>  <br>  Can he be found in a computer program? Perhaps His Name G-D the "I AM THAT I AM" in binary code? 1100100100110010101001001001<br>  <br>  I am not meaning to sound so cynical and abrasive as I DO believe in God and His existence with all of my heart... but the Fact remains that UNTIL we are wise enough to know what exactly to look for, we as a species can NEVER tangibly prove the existence of God ... or disprove it with finality until we are able to discern what HE IS and how to test that. <br>  <br>  So this debate of "Show Me Proof" on either side (for or against His Existence) could, can and will go on ad infinitum. We must, as of yet in this present moment by Faith alone either choose to believe in or not believe in His Existence based on all of the above evidences in conjunction and in juxtaposition to one another. <br>  <br>  I myself can come up with plenty of arguments In His Favour, but i can also come up with plenty against His favour ... and there exists many people oh so very much more erudite than I who could and have done the same.  But in truth I tell you, it all boils down to a matter of Faith.<br>  <br>  "Treat the other man's faith gently; it is all he has to believe with.

I voted for Obama and certainly want him to succeed, but I have never thought he was the Messiah.  <br>  <br>  The economists who follow this generally say that the stock market is crashing <br>  <br>  (a) because of global financial crisis triggered in large part by the subprime mortgage crisis.<br>  <br>  (b) because of the development over the past 20-30 years of huge hedge funds and other unregulated "non-bank banks" that made enormous gambles and lost; <br>  <br>  (c) probably also because of bad decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board under Alan Greenspan's leadership in the early 21st century, if not also before then.<br>  <br>  However, I think the global economic crisis is also being generated by<br>  <br>  (d) some fundamental instabilities in, and fundamental problems with, capitalism.  Ever 50 years or so, it has a HUGE and terrible depression, usually preceded by wild financial speculation and triggered by some kind of financial crash.<br>  <br>  This stock market crash and global economic meltdown we're seeing today are pretty terrifying.

Gf5nMPJXaa	Because he added most to Q and Markan texts.  Luke was the most likely to include all previous details and then make up his own.  Matthew was a bit more sparing and much more "Jewish" in tone (although some made up addons are indeed only in Matthew - such as the dead rising after the crucifixion etc) John just went his own route - frankly that's more a hellenistic Xian devotional tract than a narrative gospel.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	Didnt read it.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It wasn't written by "Luke".|`|FmbwIbtzaa	3. The Gospel by Luke. Luke, the physician of Antioch in Pisidia, was a gentile convert of Paul, and he wrote quite a different story of the Master's life. He began to follow Paul and learn of the life and teachings of Jesus in A.D. 47. Luke preserves much of the "grace of the Lord Jesus Christ" in his record as he gathered up these facts from Paul and others. Luke presents the Master as "the friend of publicans and sinners." He did not formulate his many notes into the Gospel until after Paul's death. Luke wrote in the year 82 in Achaia. He planned three books dealing with the history of Christ and Christianity but died in A.D. 90 just before he finished the second of these works, the "Acts of the Apostles." Page 1343-3

mrzeXJ6Eaa	Don't know. My guess is that it was transformed on the way up kind of like: <br>  Matthew 17:1-2  After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.  (2)  There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.<br>  <br>  <br>  I do think that we won't have flesh and bones in heaven, because of:<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:44  it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  Luke 24:39  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Since he apparently ascended physically upwards perhaps we have one more piece of space junk to look out for.

A few others from the old testament where taken into heaven in body.<br>  <br>  We as normal people will go in spirit until the coming of Christ, then we will have our new bodies joined with our spirits.|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	No, it was taken to Heaven. Remember that Enoch and Elijah were both taken to Heaven alive too. So, to say that no human form can exist in Heaven would just be suppostion. The truth is there are some things we just won't know unitl we get to Heaven.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	When He was resurrected He appeared to many in His human body.  Thomas one of His disciples actually touched His hands and side, scripture tells us, placing his finger in Jesus wounds.  He ascended into Heaven in His physical body.  AS for us we don't go the same way.  Do you know of anyone rising to Heaven?  Other than Jesus and Elijah who went to Heaven in a charriot of fire there have been no other cases.  <br>  <br>  Remember the Roman soldiers were afraid because He was gone!  They were told to say that the disciples had stolen the body.  Had His body remained we would not have that lie still circulating today.<br>  <br>  Good question though:)|`|qgIA507aaa	He ascended into heaven BODILY!|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	After He resurrected He had a transformed body.<br>  <br>  Remember, He could be touched (He offered Thomas to touch His wounds so he would believe it was Him), but it could also appear and disappear (the road to Emmaus and when He appeared in the upper room, even though all the doors were barred).<br>  <br>  So in heaven, we do have a body.  I dunno if it's atoms and molecules, but it is some kind of palpable body.|`|WMJwIRGxaa	No,  He ascended in His human form.  Scripture makes that quite clear.
AuCnM6Qoaa	Its a day when we remember that we are dust and unto dust we will return.     We wear our ashes on our  forehead   to show the  world what we are going to die someday|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	In the Western Church, Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent, the 40-day period of fasting before Easter. On Ash Wednesday, ashes are blessed, mixed with either holy oil or water, and imposed on the head with the sign of the cross, or sprinkled on the forehead. The ashes are made from burning palm branches blessed the previous year on Palm Sunday. When the priest imposes the ashes he says either "remember man you are dust, and to dust you will return" (see Genesis 3:19), or "turn away from sin and be faithful to the Gospel" (Mark 1:15).<br>  <br>  The ashes serve a dual purpose. First, as the above words imply, we are reminded of our mortality and humanity as we begin the Lenten Fast. Second, the ashes are a Biblical symbol of repentance, sorrow, and humility. There are many cases in the Scriptures of wearing ashes as a sign of penitence, often while wearing sackcloth. In 2 Samuel 13:19, Tamar puts on ashes and tears her clothes as a sign of sadness and repentance. In Esther 4:1-3, after learning of the king's decree to kill all Jews, Mordecai tears his garments, and puts on sackcloth and ashes. His fellow Jews do the same thing, as well as beginning to fast. The prophet Jeremiah (6:26) urges his readers to "gird on sackcloth and roll in ashes." <br>  <br>  Fasting is a major component of Ash Wednesday, and Ash Wednesday is an official fast day of the Church, along with Good Friday.<br>  <br>   In Acts 13:1-3, it was while "worshipping the Lord and fasting" that the Holy Spirit led the Apostles to set apart Paul and Barnabas for their work. In Matthew 9:14, Jesus assumes that after he leaves the earth his followers will fast. The history of the Church is filled with stories of fasting and its spiritual value. However, Jesus warns us not to be obvious about our fasting, or only fasting to impress others. Thus, Ash Wednesday is based on the biblical concept of repentance, and the ashes and fasting that are associated with repentance.<br>  <br>  Originally, Ash Wednesday was the day when public penitents in Rome began their penance. Recall that in the early Church, penance was often public and protracted. It was only later that private confession and penance began, for pastoral reasons. When public penance gradually fell into disuse by the 8th century, Ash Wednesday became a day of penitence and fasting for all members of the Church. Today, Ash Wednesday is a universal Fast day in the Catholic Church.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Great answers!  Just wanted to add that it is also a festival day in the Lutheran church as well, so not everyone wearing ashes on next Wednesday is a Catholic.... you'll have some Lutherans as well.<br>  <br>  ETA: Thanks, Grobit.... didn't know about Anglicans and Episcopalians!|`|AA11631715	the ashes are made of last years palms fronds, supposedly the materials that greeted Jesus as he entered the city where he would be executed.  The priests admonition is "remember man that thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return." The ash cross on the forehead is a reminder of this, and all to highlight the sacrifice of the Savior on the cross (coming in 40 days or so.)|`|idRvGHOEaa	usafbrat64 is right. Anglicans and Episcopalians celebrate this day as well.

When I die, I wouldn't have the opportunity any longer. <br>  <br>  But death, in the end, is inevitable. That's why this life is so important. Whether or not you have life after you die is irrelevant; what matters is how you leave a long-lasting positive influence on the people around you. So no, I'm not afraid of death. I'm preparing for it, doing as much as I can now before I leave.|`|a1d5a62697a27a23c7c47a959f58ee7baa	Not too much.  I used to be terrified at one time, but not any more.<br>  <br>  As someone else has pointed out, it's inevitable -- it's part of life, in a way.  A universally popular pastime, if you want to judge from how often people do it.<br>  <br>  I'm not religious anymore as I once was, but I like Job's attitude towards it in the story in the Old Testament and/or Jewish scripture. <br>  <br>  "The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away.  Blessed is the name of the Lord."<br>  <br>  Life is an amazing gift I never earned.  Why should I complain that it won't last forever?  And why be afraid of something that I know I will have to do?|`|aBsFGnRmaa	I look forward to it.<br>  <br>  At the same time, I love life and all of its trials and rewards.|`|u4af7B2Iaa	No, because I know of the hope I have that God has given each and every one of us. No, I'm not talking about heaven, but rather, living on a perfect earth with a perfect body; everlasting life; no wickedness, no corruption, no sickness, no death, no worry, etc. --Revelation 21:4|`|04a31323aa0674874fbc03558306d39eaa	yes Im terrified. I love life.|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	I believe that we all, including myself, are uneasy about the unknown and we are comfortable with the known.   This is why we are curious about death, Heaven and the after life.  <br>  <br>  I believe that Jesus died so that I may live.  I believe and trust Him when He tells me that He will never forsake me.  He will be with me as I walk through the valley of the "shadow" of death.  Jesus conquered death for me.  I will continue to live with Him, even though my earthly body will not.  Therefore, I fear no evil.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	I'm afraid of the pain of death. I'm afraid of being without my loved ones upon their death. I'm afraid to leave my loved ones hurting after my death. I'm not afraid to die though.|`|N4Ct35GFaa	Not so much afraid of death as I am afraid of the act of dying.  Seems to me that it can be quite painful.  Death will either be as big an adventure as life, or an eternal sleep, both sound fine to me.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	I do think about it on the odd occasion . No I am not afraid of death. Its best not to dwell on it ..I always hope I will go in my sleep peacefully.|`|MfjWoVtgaa	no but I am afraid to get old for some reason! I don't like the idea of not being able to do anything for myself and relying on other people.|`|7dN1ANT4aa	Nope. Why waste time of being afraid of something unavoidable?|`|E0uRBwWtaa	Yes.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|gPRpUIAnaa	I am half afraid. I know that there is an afterlife, but I am still afraid.

Maybe (although I don't believe in this) we will be reunited some day. And it just makes me more determined to live my life to the full. I don't even know how good I've got it. There are people out there in poverty and what not.. so I'm just going to make sure I have a damn good time in life :)|`|YAwvszITaa	I am afraid of a PAINFUL death and it makes me sad to think about leaving my friends and family behind.|`|4hsl2toNaa	For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.

Ecclesiastes 9:10<br>  <br>  I need a nap.  So no I am not afraid of death.  I am looking forward to the resurrections when the earth is a paradise.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Yes because it is the ultimate unknown.

PvPPivLJaa	Women who have natural hair tend to put others down if they wear weave sometimes.  Or, a woman with fake nails, eyelashes, weave etc would put down someone without these, calling them homely.<br>  <br>  I think we equally put down eachother, which is sad.|`|yS9a9jk5aa	No they just judge black women. Like if we wear weave also known as extensions we are put down. But other races can get nose jobs, get light skin or dark, change eye color............basically people want black women to dress like a 90 year old female, use no hair products, no make ect. and be happy as other races enbjoy themselves.<br>  <br>  Like I went to a salon to get my hair dyed and the lady said my hair is too dark. Oddly she dyed a asian women hair....the race with the darkest form of hair and I saw a before and after of a white women who went from jet black to serious blond.

Yes, I judge women that way. I want a natural woman.|`|N9WzNLsRaa	Well, it depends. If a woman has a fake nails (Maybe like a french manicure or just one color), a natural looking weave, and subtle breast implants I won't think anything of it. <br>  <br>  But if a woman has a weave that looks unnatural, long fake colorful nails, and HUGE boobs, then yes I will look at her differently. <br>  <br>  I won't know the type of person she is until I get to know her, but I will probably think she's "different" if she is more like the latter.

However, I do believe the command for all of God's people to keep many of those festivals for all time were not done away with, and neither was the weekly Sabbath which was set aside on the first week of Creation. It was the first ordained holiday...(Holy Day), set aside by God for mankind to find that peaceful rest day to commune with Him.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Worship is|`|AA10471892	There was no sabbath set up at creation. The language in Hebrew actually is designed to prevent such an association (love that language stuff) linguistically.<br>  <br>  Lev. 23 lists "sabbaths" in the old covenant. The new covenant "sabbath" (sabbatismos, Heb 4:9) is the rest one finds in Christ, aka "God's rest" and should not be confused with the weekly sabbath (sabbaton).<br>  <br>  .|`|GBKaftrJaa	Every 7th day is a Sabbath. And study Leviticus 23 for the dates of the festival Sabbaths. Then buy a Hebrew/Lunar Calendar so you can see what those dates are each year.  Then when you read the bible you will understand if they are talking about the weekly Sabbath or an extra festival Sabbath.
1fpgu5mzaa	I've used a Ouija board on several occasions, mostly for recreational purposes. I've also made my own Spirit Board (same thing, but Ouija is a brand name) that I really enjoy using. I started when I was pretty young, I think I was about 8, and I have done it infrequently ever since, and I am now 21. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean about blindfolding and not looking at the letters, because if you don't look, how do you know what its saying? I have heard stories of the circle keeping their eyes closed, and having a reader (not touching the palanchette) reading the letters, and I have tried it that way once. We got about the same results, so if anyone was subconciously pushing it, it was probably me, since I know my board the best. <br>  <br>  Anyway, part of me wants to believe that its true, and part of me thinks its a complete load of crap. You can subconciously move the palanchette (what the pointer is technically called), or if you're with a group, someone may be doing it on purpose or subconciously. <br>  <br>  I've had some interesting experiences with the Ouija board. We used it at my graduation party (only my closest friends after the rest of the guests had left) and we *supposedly* contacted the spirit of a young woman who was killed in the basement of my grandmother's house (where we were using it) in the 1930's. My grandma's house was built in 1924, and there was a young woman murdered there, so its plausible, but I knew all of this stuff before we started, so I might have been unconsciously moving it. <br>  <br>  We also used it at one of my friend's houses in a camper trailer in the middle of a pasture, and we supposedly contacted some nasty American Native spirits who wanted to kill her stepdad, but once again, could have been her unconsciously moving the palanchette, since she had a really bad relationship with him.  However, this session felt really intense, and my limbs all got extremely cold and it felt like something was holding my fingers to the palanchette. <br>  <br>  In another session, the 'spirit' refused to interact with us if my friend touched the palanchette at all, and that was the session that we used her as a "reader." Later in the conversation, the 'spirit' revealed that it was my friend Natalie's spirit protector (kind of like a guardian angel) and told her about her 'past lives.'<br>  <br>  So...I'm not sure what I think. But I always take safety measures, just in case it is real, because I'd rather be safe than sorry. Not to mention, they can be kind of fun :) What I always do is: <br>  -I have four candles, either all white or one for each of the elements (fire: red, water: blue, earth: green or brown, air: white) and place them at the four corners of the board. <br>  -Cast a protection circle if one of your group is a Wiccan or a Pagan, and if not, at least draw a circle around the area with non-iodized salt (usually can be found at grocery stores for about $1. If not, table salt is an OK alternative.) This supposedly keeps malevolent spirits out. <br>  -At the beginning of your session, declare that you're only interested in communicating with well-meaning, benign spirits. <br>  -If any 'spirit' that you contact tries to spell the alphabet in order (ie, the pointer moves to A, then B, then C, etc) or starts spelling "evil" words (like 'devil' 'satan' 'demon' 'hell') etc, force the palanchette to "goodbye". Supposedly this means than an evil spirit is trying to manifest.  I had the board do this once, and it was actually really frightening. The palanchette and our fingers felt really warm, and the same 'spirit' kept coming back. We ended up having to put the board up for the night. <br>  -If you can, have someone in your circle hold or wear something made out of real silver or sterling silver. Supposedly keeps bad spirits away. <br>  <br>  Don't know if any of this does any good, but i can tell you that it really helps you get into a 'supernatural' mood. Even if none of it is real, it is really fun. And if you believe in it, it might tell you something really profound. <br>  <br>  I've gotten years of enjoyment out my Ouija and Spirit Boards, and I encourage any one curious to try it out for themselves before they make a judgement of whether you think its real or not. So, I encourage you, try it. See what you think. If you dont like it, you don't have to do it again. Best of Luck!|`|GROkWyBAaa	Ouija boards fake, not dangerous, and frankly quite boring. The ideomotor effect is top contributor of making the planchette move. There are no dangers in playing, unless you are easily manipulated, in which case, you'll convince yourself that ghosts are out to get you. It will not truly work, regardless of who's playing.<br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that Monopoly is a portal to the "spirit world"? Me neither...Ouija boards are exactly the same, just a game. There are two types of people: People who are afraid to use a Ouija board, and therefore have no right to talk about how they are real AND people who have convinced themselves ghosts exist. Don't be either of those, be an intelligent human being.<br>  <br>  These videos will definitely help...Especially video 2 about the blindfold experiment.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	I'm not very superstitious in general but I'm not going to say anything is impossible.

The other girls were whispering and making up stories, then obviously pushing around the planchette to get it to spell the words they wanted.  They told me I would grow up to marry a man named Ian.  I forgot all about it, but guess what?  Ten years later, I did!  Then we had a bad marriage and a horrible divorce.

And if I'm honest more interesting because of the new letters. Personally I would recommend who learn an easier language first like Spanish or French if you already don't speak a language. Trust me, If you learnt a foreign language already learning another one will be easier because you already have the expierence needed of having learnt a new language, in other words first time is more difficult. Also many grammar rules exist in all many languages i.e. Spanish has verb conjugation which applies in Russian also. Learning a language can also help you understand your own language as well. I learnt Spanish I didn't know what prepositions were and have many tenses there actually are. So it is v. interesting I find, but you have to have patience otherwise you will go nowhere in learning a language

yQNit56Qaa	1) There it goes, the scripture that authorizes any Protestant denomination that speaks Good of Jesus. <br>  <br>  Yikes!  I'm a Protestant, but that is *not* what that Scripture does! (That is, authorize any denomination that speaks well of Jesus)  What it does is *permit* (not authorize) miracles performed in Jesus' name (not "speaking well of Jesus").  You *did* read it, right?  It has nothing to do with sectarianism whatsoever!<br>  <br>  <br>  2) So why do Catholics preach that you have to follow them if this person didn't follow the apostles and Jesus was ok with it?<br>  <br>  Again, you misunderstood the passage.  The apostles weren't complaining that the "maverick" miracle worker wasn't following them.  They were complaining that he was performing miracles in Jesus' name without supervision from Jesus.  Thus, the maverick was not "following us", not a part of Jesus' retinue of apostles and disciples taking direction from him directly.  They *were* complaining that he was a maverick - but *not* that he was a maverick with respect to doctrine!  Rather, they were complaining that he was a maverick not under Jesus' direct and immediate supervision.  Think of him as a missionary or a pastor - he was doing God's work without being under the *immediate* supervision of his superior, Jesus.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with Protestantism.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com/selector_rc.html|`|IHIiyyCTaa	Amazing, How in heaven's name do you read Mark 9: 38 --41  as  Jesus saying " You don't have to follow His apostles"...|`|dDMOJWxwaa	He was not one of the Twelve to whom the express power had been given to cast out devils (Matt. 10:8); he was not one of the inner circle of disciples who traveled, ate, slept, and communed continually with the Master. Luke has it: "He followeth not with us"; that is, he is not one of our traveling companions. But from our Lord's reply it is evident that he was a member of the kingdom, a legal administrator who was acting in the authority of the priesthood and the power of faith. Either he was unknown to John who therefore erroneously supposed him to be without authority or else John falsely supposed that the power to cast out devils was limited to the Twelve and did not extend to all faithful priesthood holders. It is quite possible that the one casting out devils was a seventy. There is no New Testament record of the calling of the first quorum of seventy, but when Jesus (at a later day) called a second quorum of seventy into the ministry, he expressly gave them the power to cast out devils. (Luke 10:1-20.)|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Jesus said that anyone whois 'not against us is with us" but what if the preacher is against us (the Church Jesus founded, the Catholic Church)?<br>  <br>  Would you permit a New Age healer to have miracle services in your church if he taught agaist your church's teachings but claimed to heal in the name and power of Jesus( who may be an incarnation of Vishnu, by his teachings) on the strength of the quoted passage?<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church,unlike many Fundamentalist Protestant denominations,does not say that so-and so is in Hell nor does the Church since Vat II tolerate Catholics demanding that everybody has to become RC to get to Heaven, unlike so many FPs who damn all non FPs( and ofteneven Fps who disagree with them).<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "He who does not gather with Me ,scatters" and the whole New testament emphasizes communion with the Apostles' and their Church<br>  <br>  We should not pick out a verse or two to smash others<br>  "A text out of  context is a pretext"<br>  <br>  There would be no New Testament without the Catholic Church to discern what books were of it, canonize them and preserve them for Protestants to use over a 1000 years later when they broke off from the Church.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church encourages ecumenism which is dialogue with, working with,praying with and service with Non Catholic Christians who are considered part of the Family of Christ and His Mystical Body<br>  <br>  My Catholic diocese and parish have Protestant ministers speak  in our church and churches and we see them as men (and women)of God<br>  <br>  Not all Protestant denominations (Sola Fide et Sola Scriptura) are trinitarian and would be considered heretical in basics by the rest of the Protestant denominations and plenty Trinitarian denominations consider other Protestant Trinitarian denominations( between 9,000 to 50,000 Protestant denominations, depending on how one divides) to be heretical . <br>  <br>  Many Protestant groups are closer to Catholicism than they are to many othe rProtestant groups.<br>  <br>  The "cup of cold water" passage is used by many Christians to refute salvation by faith alone(isolated from charity).<br>  <br>  God bless and may  all who profess to be Christian show respect and charity to others and may all Christians encourage each other to care for the needy and to proclaim Jesus as Lord and Saviour!|`|h5q89E3Haa	Throw out your bible, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Paul are all Apostles.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  The king James version is an uninspired book of heresies. <br>  <br>  Would you depend on a bible that was Commissioned by Bill Clinton?|`|3PuKXEwZaa	Jesus said that those who reject the apostles reject Him also.

"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice" (Matt. 23:2–3). <br>  <br>  What Fundamentalists and Evangelicals often do, unfortunately, is see the word "tradition" in Matthew 15:3 or Colossians 2:8 or elsewhere and conclude that anything termed a "tradition" is to be rejected. <br>  They forget that the term is used in a different sense, as in 1 Corinthians 11:2 and 2 Thessalonians 2:15, to describe what should be believed. <br>  Jesus did not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous traditions, whether doctrines or practices, that undermined Christian truths. <br>  The rest, as the apostles taught, were to be obeyed. <br>  Paul commanded the Thessalonians to adhere to all the traditions he had given them, whether oral or written. <br>  <br>  The first Christians "devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching" (Acts 2:42) long before there was a New Testament. From the very beginning, the fullness of Christian teaching was found in the Church as the living embodiment of Christ, not in a book. The teaching Church, with its oral, apostolic tradition, was authoritative.<br>  <br>  Christ sent His Apostles with authority to teach all nations, and never gave them any command of writing the Bible. And the Apostles went forth and preached everywhere, and planted the Church of God throughout the earth, but never thought of writing. <br>  <br>  Private interpretation of the Scripture cannot be the guide or teacher of man.<br>  That seems to be what you are doing.....private interpreting Scripture.<br>  <br>  The true "rule of faith"—as expressed in the Bible itself—is Scripture plus apostolic tradition, as manifested in the living teaching authority of the Catholic Church, to which were entrusted the oral teachings of Jesus and the apostles, along with the authority to interpret Scripture correctly. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  John 15:16 - Jesus chose men to be his Apostles<br>  John 20:21 - Jesus made these men sharers in His own mission.<br>  Luke 22:29-30 - These men are part of the kingdom.<br>  Matthew 16:18 - Jesus built His Church upon Peter, who holds the keys of the kingdom.<br>  John 10:16 - One sheperd to lead Christ's flock.<br>  John 21:17 - Christ choose Peter<br>  Ephesians 4:11 - Proof of the hierarchical<br>  1 Tim 3:1, 8, 5:17 - Various offices in the hierarchy<br>  Titus 1:5 - Bishops ordain deacons.<br>  Malachi 2:7 - Seek instructions from the ministerial priesthood, they are God's messangers.<br>  Acts 1:20 - Another person fulfills the Apostles office after their death.<br>  Acts 1:25-26 - Matthias is choosen to replace Peter<br>  1 Tim 4:14 - The gift of the priesthood is given by the laying on of hands.<br>  1 Tim 5:22 - Laying on of hands is not given to everyone.<br>  Acts 14:23 - The Apostles appointed priests for each Church. The Church was not governed by the laity.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	The King James Version is hard to understand because it's in the King's Tongue...so here's the New American Standard Edition's translation: <br>  <br>  (38) John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us." <br>  <br>  (39) Jesus replied, "Do not prevent him. There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me. <br>  <br>  (40) For whoever is not against us is for us. <br>  <br>  The problem with this is that the Protestant Churches are against us. <br>  <br>  This is about jealousy. Just before this, they were discussing who was the greatest among them and then John goes into how there was a man casting out demons, but the man wouldn't listen to them. It's a jump to say the least unless it's a continuation on what was earlier stated. <br>  <br>  We are reminded that the Pope is the servant of the Church, not the lord or the Church. Yes, he has power and he is the Vicar of Christ, but it is because he is the Servant of the Servants that he is given this honor. <br>  <br>  Here's an example of what this means:<br>  <br>  The Greek Orthodox Church does not follow us, but they believe the same as we do and hold firm the same values, beliefs and understanding. They do not follow us, but they are not against us.<br>  <br>  Whereas many of our Protestant brethren have made it very clear that they are against us. Many have made it clear that they are against Jesus by refusing to believe in some of the most basic Christian beliefs (i.e. the Trinity, not saved by "faith alone", once saved always saved and so on).|`|YnGIccE8aa	Polkadot -- the ONLY people who say people are going to hell around here is you protestants -- we do not say that.

There was a time when there still existed a small amount of true faith in them but that time has passed. Great light has been shinning upon them but with every rejection they made they completely separated themselves from the Lord and joined themselves wholly to the Devil. Their thirst for worldly power and the blood of any who stood in their way is clear proof of that. American protestant believe that Rome has changed but it is them that have changed. They have clasped hands with the papal "man of sin" and will exalt him again to put him on the throne of this world which was his in the dark ages.<br>  As concerning the one not following Christ with the rest of the apostles he represented those who humbly follow him from a distant feeling unworthy of Him who is truly HIS HOLINESS.|`|AuCnM6Qoaa	Get the American Sanded Bible for the truth.

The Holy Catholic Church has the tradition and the Bible to guide us.<br>  I think you are referring to the  time that the apostles came to Jesus and said'' some guys over there are curing the sick in your name'' And Jesus said'' those  that are not against us are with us''|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Good point.<br>  (1 Timothy 4:1-5) However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons, 2?by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron; 3?forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth. 4?The reason for this is that every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 5?for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over [it].

MSEyXHFWaa	That sounds like about it. <br>  <br>  @tzadiq.<br>  <br>  Your example is off. You see, there is reason to believe in things like evolution and the Big Bang. <br>  <br>  Things like the fossil record (which is only as incomplete as religious fanatics want it to be), geographic isolation, vestigial organs, genetics, the fact that the universe is in a red shift, etc, etc. I don't think you'll find any good scientist who will say that these theories are only as credible as religion; they have been built on a factual basis.<br>  <br>  Your example of abiogenesis is also lacking. Life was not created "by a lightening strike or something", it is theorized that small, self-replicating organic molecules formed on polarized clay beds, or were brought in by comets. No one knows for certain what exactly caused it, but one thing is for certain: the theory will evolve as we know more, which is a hell of a lot more than one can say for religion, which hasn't updated it's view of how the cosmos came to be since the dawn of time.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what you claim, these beliefs are not based on faith, but on the best evidence that we can piece together. The evidence may not be much, but it's better to at least take it into account instead of claiming that "Goddidit". Trying to argue God from ignorance is always a poor idea. <br>  <br>  Also "I has a baseball" is humourous internet wording, not a mental deficiency. You need to get out on the internet more.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  It's TheOriginOfSpecies, not TheOriginal. : )<br>  <br>  “The original: The source of your facts? Isn't it something you read or something someone told you? Have YOU personally proven it to be true? I thought not.”<br>  <br>  There is a big difference between accepting a peer-reviewed scientific theory and taking the word of religious leaders. By your own argument, there is no criteria for judging truth from fiction; it’s all faith. I’ll believe something if it appears to be well supported. By your argument, there is no way to draw the line; all theories must be equally valid. This is not so, that statement is misleading at best.<br>  <br>  “In fact you said 'no one knows for certain' Golly Polly Anna I guess that means I should throw away my belief in God as creator because someone guessed how it all started.”<br>  <br>  I did say “no one knows for certain”, but you seem to have ignored my very next sentence. It is better to take a stab with the evidence that you have at hand, then to make a totally irrelevant theory. You should throw away your belief for God as a creator because the infinity complex renders the God-driven theory useless. It is a fallacy at best. Take the theory with the most evidence.<br>  <br>  The abiogenesis theory is the best theory suited to explain the origins of life. It actually takes evidence into account, unlike religious theories. It is not faith, it is science. Blind faith is believing in something without evidence, science is using the evidence to form a workable theory. There is no way that religious theories can ever compete with scientific ones in forms of merit; the scientists have evidence.<br>  <br>  “And again there is evidence that there was a designer creater rather than random events happening in just the right place at just the right time. What you theories don't teach is after the random event that led to life which is greater than 1 to all the stars in the universe for what reason would it evolve into something differant as it would be perfect for the enviroment in which it was created.

rGEZup0Zaa	Not a Muslim or a scholar, but in the history books I've read it has always been defined as "submission", and never as "peace".<br>  <br>  Islam is submission (to the will of God), and a Muslim is one who has submitted.<br>  <br>  Whether there is a connotation that this brings peace, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Edit: The noted Arabist author, Bernard Lewis, defines Islam thusly: 'Islam' is an Arabic word, usually explained by Muslims and others as meaning 'surrender', that is to say, the surrender of the believer to God. The active participle of the same verb, 'Muslim', means one who performs the act of surrender. <br>  <br>  Bernard Lewis, "The Middle East", page 219.|`|DTog0VZWaa	The first time I heard the root as peace was only a few days ago.  For all the time I went to interfaith Muslim events or spoke with Muslims, it meant Submission with no reference to peace whatsoever in the concept.<br>  <br>  Like Hebrew that works with roots of words in a similar way, with the root in Submission, it wouldn't be possible for it to be in Peace too.  There are some Hebrew words that get confused too by those whose who see similar letters & assume, but real roots are what they are.  <br>  <br>  Here's an article on how semitic roots work (though it's a little dense to make it relevant):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(lingu...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a list of roots in Islam.  <br>  <a href="http://wahiduddin.net/words/arabic_glossary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wahiduddin.net/words/arabic_gloss...</a><br>  s-l-m to be safe, secure, protected, to surrender, to submit   <br>  (al-salam, islam, sal?m, muslim)<br>  <br>  Possibily they come from the same root, but are different derivations & meanings - therefore they are not the same meaning.

In spite of whatever noble intention has caused many a Muslim to claim that Islam is derived primarily from peace, this is not true. <br>  <br>  Allah says in the Qur'an (translated):<br>  <br>  [2:136] Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed to us and that which was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have surrendered. [Arabic "Muslimoon"]<br>  <br>  A secondary root of Islam may be "Al-Salaam" (peace), however the text of the Qur'an makes it clear that Allah has clearly intended the focus of this way of life to be submission to Him. <br>  <br>  This entails submission to Him at all times, in times of peace, war, ease, or difficulty.<br>  <br>  2:131: -- When his Lord said to him, "Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!"

I believe in peace and comfort. I believe in love and acceptance. I believe that too many people make it too complicated. My personal experiences at the death of my loved ones leads me to believe these things. I didn't get it out of some book and I don't listen to the dictates of so called "spiritual leaders". <br>  In short, I  don't REALLY know...and I don't believe that anyone else does either.

That we go to different places, depending on our beliefs in life, and the doctrines there in.

Continued debate will only frustrate you and perhaps weaken your deen.<br>  <br>  If you just can't live without responding (and really, I think you shouldn't) I would suggest saying simply:  "It doesn't appear that I wrote clearly; you seem to misunderstand my intentions.  No hard feelings, Salam."<br>  <br>  I think you DID write clearly, but it's nicer to not blame the other person, and they're more likely to listen (in this case, re-read) if you take a humble approach.<br>  <br>  But honestly, these people thrive off attention, so by responding, they'll just respond back and again, etc. and you'll get no where but frustrated.<br>  <br>  Take care and for the record, I agree with you.|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	True<br>  <br>  Plus Muslim women are trying to become like Men like in West.<br>  They are neither women nor men now.|`|mOWyzwubaa	the question is ,if the prostitute was a proven adultress why wasnt she punished !<br>  dont you think it contradicts Quran ?|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Sounds like a whole lot of rigor mortis over the physical...and complete ignorance of the spiritual.<br>  <br>  You're right--people are not going to burn in hell based on what they wear or do not wear.<br>  <br>  God--the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent Being would not be so superficial.<br>  <br>  Clothing is something HUMANS want and need...from the very beginning.  God never told Adam & Eve that they should be ashamed by their nakedness.  Adam & Eve felt ashamed after they had eaten of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  This is obviously an allegory for more than just physical nudity, but as you see--God has never felt that the human body must be hidden.<br>  <br>  That is something determined by humans and their societies and cultures...which is why you see women in Saudi Arabia completely covered save for their eyeballs, but in the Himba tribe in Namibia, Africa, it's completely normal to see women wearing nothing but small, grass skirts.|`|U5zcbHuZaa	I suggest going to my Questions, reading the two titled, Stranger than fiction, proof of prophecy?

Yes I can find evidence of a prostitute as well as a man that killed over a hundred people who were forgiven and abated for their actions. However reading to much into it and thinking that that is an action worth attempting isn't ideal at all.  I think with people like that it isn't worth your reply. just do your best yourself and don't worry about ppl like him.  There are many sisters and brothers that will present themselves as scholars and set expectations upon you how to live your life when in fact their own lives my be a tragic mess and meanwhile we try to present how to try to correct and appease ourselves to them when in doing so you lose sight of something I had to learn the hard way.

He replied:<br>  <br>  “As for women wearing pants or trousers, this is not permitted, even if she is on her own or in front of other women or her husband, except if she is in a closed room with her husband only. Apart from that, it is not permitted because it shows the details of her body and makes her get used to these clothes. So she is not permitted to wear these clothes at all.” (al-Nukhbah min al-Fataawaa al-Nisaa’iyyah, p. 30).<br>  <br>  Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen was also asked about the ruling on women wearing any kind of pants or trousers. He (may Allaah preserve him) answered:<br>  <br>  “I think that women should not wear trousers at all, even if there is no one with her apart from her husband, because this is imitating men. The ones who wear trousers are men, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who imitate men.” <br>  <br>  Majmoo’ Fataawaa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, part 12, p. 287

Lets look at it in context though. Jesus has been giving the famous sermon on the mount where He spoke to a large crowd that had gathered.  Talking about life and how we are to live pleasing to God.  <br>  <br>  He said in the above verses Matt 6:19-21 :<br>   19"(A)Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.<br>  <br>   20"But store up for yourselves (B)treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;<br>  <br>   21for (C)where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.<br>  <br>  Then goes on to talk about  the eye being the lamp of the body .. do not serve two masters.  Then continues where we come to the scripture you had questions about:<br>  <br>  25"(H)For this reason I say to you, do not be (I)worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?<br>  <br>   26"(J)Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?<br>  <br>   27"And who of you by being (K)worried can (L)add a single hour to his life?<br>  <br>   28"And why are you (M)worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,<br>  <br>   29yet I say to you that not even (N)Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.<br>  <br>   30"But if God so clothes the (O)grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? (P)You of little faith!<br>  <br>   31"Do not (Q)worry then, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear for clothing?'<br>  <br>   32"For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for (R)your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.<br>  <br>   33"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and (S)all these things will be added to you.<br>  <br>   34"So do not (T)worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. <br>  <br>  If you look at it all in context and think about who Jesus is speaking to it all connects.  We are not to worry about wealth or what to wear and so forth but instead have complete faith and trust in the Lord.  Not that we are to sit around and do nothing lol but focus on God!  Does that help?  <br>  <br>  Blessings :)|`|cXdoFRVsaa	It's saying not to worry.

6ELSwKKvaa	Men are wired to get aroused by visual stimulation but women are wired to become aroused by emotional stimulation. I have said before that Men are like microwaves and women are like ovens. Men can be ready for sex by just a thought but a woman needs to be emotionally connected in order for it to be fulfilling. It is just the way we are designed.<br>  <br>   Foreplay can start anywhere and doesn't always have to be sexual. Just making a woman feel that she is desirable (not only in a sexual way) is a turn on for most women. To feel like she is loved and appreciated goes a long way in starting to turn a woman on. <br>  <br>   If a man treats a woman like an object all day groping her and not respecting her and never makes her feel that she is special, when night comes and it's time to get together, it is going to take a LOT to get her in the mood. Women are more likely to view sex as a way to emotionally connect with our partner but men tend to think of it more as a way to feel really good for a while.<br>  <br>   For women, it isn't about how good you do in bed but how good of a person you are and how you treat her all day long.|`|AuVlR4cYaa	..people are different.<br>  So I can't really answer that question.

He's done as a senator.|`|7sgJuukQaa	Well, i agree in the sense that it's a corrupt politician......thing. Sen Burris, should not have accepted the nomination.....regardless of his skin color. But, I guess he saw an opportunity to climb up the latter, but his record will now have a certain stigma attached to it. Really he blemished himself, by accepting Blagoavich's nomination.|`|MP1nA5fRaa	It  isn't about race, its about a man accepting the Senate seat and lying to the House Committee.

HIMwyeZqaa	I voted for Obama as a loyal white woman.  The white candidate wanted to continue destroying our very white nation.  So far, Obama hasn't done any differently than super vandal -- George Bush.   That white man from Hope, Arkansas had us in a situation where unemployment was low along with inflation.  We had a record surplus.  That was ten years ago.  Obama needs to honor his promise of change.  Four more years of Bush like policies and we will be wet backing it across the Rio Grande.<br>  <br>  Ogun, the KKK sometimes fly the Stars and Bars but the flag they fly most often is the Stars and Stripes.

We had a lot of new voters come out and vote this time around and the demographics quickly changed when Obama was running. <br>  One of the major reason's why he is in office now is because a lot of people wanted to see a black man as president, and a great majority who voted for him were black. <br>  <br>  He's in office for the wrong reason and I'm sad to say that it is a race issue.|`|AA12218589	Dude.

dee03940d6492e88a5a0c3a3911a99dfaa	As much as ANY kind of belief/faith would be... Think about it, what makes people believe that they will become doctors, rock stars or be successful in business? The religious person could believe all of that too based on trusting the existence of a power s/he can count on... right?<br>  <br>   So a good question would be: what power is the non-religious person putting his/her "faith" on when thinking his/her life path/direction will turn out okey? Ask anyone you know if they look forward to their future lives believing it will be awful...  <br>  <br>  So the point being that in essence what we're talking about is an all much more interesting phenomena than anything to do with "religion faith" or "mass delusion".<br>  <br>  Completely non-religious people will have to admit that a creative sort of process has always been a part of their lives in which anticipating the outcome of things in the way they would desire it is a constant. In fact there's no other way to do it !! <br>  <br>  You might categorize the "religious" type "delusional" for believing dogma, scripture and other things you probably disagree with, but whether believing "religious" based teachings or not is actually irrelevant since we could as much categorize anybody "delusional" for believing anything -at all- will turn out the way they would like to... <br>  <br>  And you know what? Giving your life any kind of conscious direction could not even be possible without some kind of secular "belief" period. Yes sure, some may be in a complete state of unawareness about this (state of unknowing and/or denial) but that does not make what's been really going on (all along) untrue.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	faith comes down to the individual and their relationship to God, religion is a mass of the faithful together. the delusion is believing that you know all the answers.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Christian|`|cbtKJFNvaa	Yes.

I'm of the opinion that religion is basically used to control people. I'm not saying religion is wrong, just that it nowadays is used improperly. But hey, if someone is religious and has faith and they believe it works for them, more power to them.

But back to your question.If you are curious about bing with the same sex, then that makes your bi-curious.If you experiment just once, then you've only experimented.Now, if you continue to hook up with your friend, and you enjoy what's bein gdone then yes, that would make you bi sexual.And last but not least, if it's so good, and you can't see yourself being with another man, then that would make you lesbian|`|AuVlR4cYaa	Uh, you don't just wake up and say "I think I'm gonna try liking girls.."<br>  It doesn't work like that.<br>  Maybe you don't realize it until a certain time in your life; but you don't DECIDE to be bi/lesbian.|`|SOx6VwYCaa	Umm..you cant just turn bisexual! lol =P<br>  Maybe try it out and see if you like it, if you do then your bi, if not then you cant turn bi!

In the absence of a policy, keep in mind that when invitations are passed out at school, excluded students may have their feelings hurt.

If you (or your child) are in elementary school you can give them to the teacher to put in the students mail boxes for the end of the day, that way the uninvited students are less likely to find out.

ZFllYTlpaa	The Gospel According to Matthew Authorship<br>  <br>  Since the times of the early church fathers, the apostle Matthew has always been accredited with the authorship of the first gospel (canonically). Even the title "According to Matthew" (KATA MAQQAION) is found in the earliest manuscripts, and was the most highly regarded and quoted of the gospels by the church fathers. [1] Matthew is also called Levi (Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27), and was the son of Alphaeus (Luke 5:27). He was a tax collector (telwnhV), probably stationed on a main trade route near Capernaum where he would have collected tolls for Herod Antipas from commercial traffic. [2] Additionally, being a tax collector might better qualify Matthew for his role as an official recorder of the life and actions of Christ. [3] After the resurrection there is no other mention of him in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  According to the resources available to us, Papias (the Bishop of Hieropolis in Phrygia ca. AD 130) was the first to associate the apostle Matthew with this document. Eusebius, the early church historian, records Papias' account: "Matthew collected the oracles (ta logia) in the Hebrew language, and each interpreted them as best he could." [4] This quote also introduces some problems. What was Papias referring to when he stated that Matthew wrote in the Hebrew dialect? Some have understood this not as a reference to the Hebrew as we have in the Old Testament, but instead the Syro-Chaldaic, [5] or Aramaic. On the other hand, most scholars insist that Matthew was originally written in Greek because many parts of the Gospel are extremely (if not identically) similar to Mark's, which was indubitably written in Greek. Others have also concluded that Matthew wrote two Gospels—one in a Palestinian language and the other in Greek. Ralph Martin's conclusion is that "Papias' tradition can at best relate only to a collection of material later used in the composition of the entire Gospel." [6]<br>  <br>  Not until the eighteenth century did the question of authorship become an issue. More recently, since Matthew does rely heavily on Mark's Gospel (see "Date and Location of Composition" below), some scholars have discarded the idea that the author was one of the twelve apostles. On the other hand, Papias also said that Mark was the interpreter of Peter, [7] and therefore, the apostle Matthew would not have a problem with deferring to the early leader of the church. [8]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Date and Location of Composition<br>  <br>  Various estimates have placed the date of Matthew's composition anywhere from AD 50 - to AD 100. But before a date can be decided, its relation to the Gospel of Mark must first be addressed. If Mark was written first, then Matthew must have a later date (and vice-versa). The most widely accepted hypothesis is that both Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source for various reasons. Matthew even reproduced about ninety percent of Mark, while Luke reproduced about sixty percent. [9] Without going into much detail on the dating of Mark's Gospel, [10] it was probably written somewhere between AD 50 and AD 55. Consequently, Matthew's Gospel could have reasonably been written anywhere between AD 55 and AD 60. This date allows time for Matthew to have access to Mark's Gospel, and suggests that he completed the Gospel before the destruction of the temple in AD 70, because it would seem strange for the author not to mention this event in light of chapter 24. [11] This dating also allows time for Luke to use Matthew's Gospel in composing his own Gospel, as well as its sequel (Acts, ca. AD 62).<br>  <br>  Though dating the Gospel maybe difficult or complicated, it is even more problematic to determine where Matthew wrote the Gospel. Most scholars conclude that Matthew was written in either Palestine or Syria because of its Jewish nature. Antioch of Syria is usually the most favoured because many in the early church dispersed there (Acts 11:19, 27). Another reason for favouring Antioch is that the earliest reference to Matthew's Gospel was found in Ignatius' (the Bishop of Antioch) Epistle to the Smyrnaeans (ca. 110).|`|mVsWyu0yaa	No.  The gospels were all written anonymously, and the names of the apostles were appended to them in the Fourth century...ONLY after Constantine declared Christianity the Official religion of the Empire.  Once the Christian church had gained such unlimited power, it began the systematic persecution of 'pagans' the destruction of all books (including the more than 200 other gospels that had been circulating in the churches for 3 centuries) that refuted, or contradicted "official" church teaching.  It is only in our century that many of these gospels have come to light...offering a totally different picture of Jesus, than those of the four canonized gospels. <br>  <br>  With the 19th Century perfection of 'textual' criticism, the errors, contradictions and late Christian interpolations and forgeries in the gospels, were finally exposed.|`|dF5clN4daa	Matthew was a tax collector whose life was changed by God... He spoke (at least) the gospel and then maybe another penned his words (a scribe perhaps)... but in the end God is the author.  He dwells in heaven and is eternal.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|FOZGMadaaa	God is the author|`|7utlNXpKaa	The Gospel of Matthew was written by Matthew in order to give proof that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. He wrote the book somewhere between 60 and 65 a.d. in Jerusalem. This book records his account of Jesus, just as Mark give his account of Jesus in the book of Mark to let the world know of Jesus's teachings, works, and healings. Mark was written in Rome between 55 and 65 a.d. Luke gives his account of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke in order to tell of Jesus and let you know how perfect of a life he really lived, it was written by Luke in 60 a.d in either Rome or Caesarea. Finally, John gives his account of Jesus through the Gospel of John, in which he wants to prove that Jesus is without a doubt the Son of God and that his followers will have eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven. The book was written in about 70 a.d. after the destruction of Jerusalem in the city of Ephesus.|`|PWankIUpaa	The Writer was Mathew  a Levitt  or Matthew ben Levi . <br>  It was written about 30 to 35n years after the death of Jesus. It contains a lot of Hebraic Phraseology which is awkward in Greek but understood more easily in English and Hebrew.<br>  <br>  Matthew was a Tax collector whom Jesus called as he sat by the gate of Jerusalem to be one o f the disciples. <br>  <br>  His story is given in the Book of Matthew ans this book was originally written in Hebrew then translated for the gentile believers into Greek or Aramaic which was the common language of that day.|`|9f3fef8c85fa161e18f4848f36e97fb8aa	The unknown author, whom we shall continue to call Matthew for the sake of convenience, drew not only upon the Gospel according to Mark but upon a large body of material (principally, sayings of Jesus) not found in Mark that corresponds, sometimes exactly, to material found also in the Gospel according to Luke. This material, called "Q" (probably from the first letter of the German word Quelle, meaning "source"), represents traditions, written and oral, used by both Matthew and Luke. Mark and Q are sources common to the two other synoptic gospels; hence the name the "Two-Source Theory" given to this explanation of the relation among the synoptics.<br>  <br>  In addition to what Matthew drew from Mark and Q, his gospel contains material that is found only there. This is often designated "M," written or oral tradition that was available to the author. Since Mark was written shortly before or shortly after A.D. 70 (see Introduction to Mark), Matthew was composed certainly after that date, which marks the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans at the time of the First Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-70), and probably at least a decade later since Matthew's use of Mark presupposes a wide diffusion of that gospel. The post-A.D. 70 date is confirmed within the text by Matthew 22:7, which refers to the destruction of Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  As for the place where the gospel was composed, a plausible suggestion is that it was Antioch, the capital of the Roman province of Syria. That large and important city had a mixed population of Greek-speaking Gentiles and Jews. The tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians there in the time of Paul (see Gal 2:1-14) in respect to Christian obligation to observe Mosaic law are partially similar to tensions that can be seen between the two groups in Matthew's gospel. The church of Matthew, originally strongly Jewish Christian, had become one in which Gentile Christians were predominant.|`|y9bbLn7qaa	Whether or not Matt. physically penned it or used a scribe Matt. is the author.

X9RoKfWPaa	a heatagram is another form of a pentagram.The only difference it has to a pentagram is that it only has three points instead of the five that a pentagram has. It is used in ritualistic ways to signify something i could be love or other things but basically it is just a symbol used in withcraft and wiccan religions. It can also be used as a talisman for witches that follow a certain path or worship a certain god or goddess|`|ceC8lCM2aa	HELL I DON'T KNOW
be78fb3ef714e3deabcf82d71938b4adaa	I have the same feelings as you do.  I feel like I would fit in perfectly in SanFran.  I am gay and very laid back.  HOWEVER, knowing what I know...I would not be able to live the same lifestyle I do here.  I have my own apartment, good job, etc here in Chicago.  I would need at least two roommates to survive in SanFran with the salary (if i kept the same type job)  It is quite expensive and I cannot give up my living alone for roomies. <br>  <br>   If you have the money to live on your own then go for it.|`|5iiQnjE2aa	Because there are many LGBTQ people in the bay area, there are many facets and subgroups here outside of the "bar scene". The bay area is a beautiful place, especially for people who want to do outdoors activities (like camping and hiking). If you're considering a move here (I live in SF), i'd suggest a visit where you look for the things most important to you. check out as many city neighborhoods as you can (not just the Castro area). don't spend all your time in the city proper. there's a lot going on on the peninsula south of the city and across the bay. The nice thing about SF is that you can get around really easily without a car b/c there is a very good public transit system in place here.|`|K2SOMH6iaa	you should move to olympia, wa.<br>  there's a great gay scene there, a great music scene, TONS of hippies, and gardens and stuff, not too many bars.|`|FmJMyUvLaa	i used to live in cally. u wud fit in perfectly. expecially down on the beach side
rpzHSaI9aa	Of course it does not make you a racist!! Those who are (more likely) racist are the ones making the racist jokes.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	No, I think that they're the ones who are racists for joking around about other people that aren't the same race as them. The next time that they say something that bothers you about someone else, ask them, "How would you like it if they made fun of you cause you were (fill in the blank)?" That should teach them!|`|9wUe5xHzaa	It doesn't make you racist. Neither does telling the jokes, though. They're probably trying to be "edgy" or something, but they wind up looking stupid.|`|WXiGGjvmaa	I could have written your question.  It does not make you a racist.  I am not a racist and often find myself getting offended by certain jokes that clearly cross the line.  My husband laughs at me quite often because my pet peeve is racism, and has said that I am racist against people who are racist.  So now every time I get offended by a joke that crosses the line he tells me I'm being racist against the racist.|`|Q2MtW25Iaa	by being offened by a racist joke DOES not mean you are racist.  They are the racist by telling the joke and you are just putting a stop towards it.
3DjUX8etaa	That's true. When something good happens we praise and rejoice. But, when something bad happens we are silent. But, not for reason you think. It is because that is the time that we are in prayer with God to give us the strength and understanding to remain faithful to his word and obedient to his commandments.   God Bless!  +?+|`|yHfsHp6naa	Because they think rationality is a foreign language.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	I disagree. I know several people who claim to be Christian and if something terrible happens in their life (or even if the life of somebody they don't know), they BLAME God! Ironic to me.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Not so with the Christian I KNOW.  Bad things happen to them, and they say.. "I don't know WHY,  but there must be a reason,  maybe God is doing some "work" here  or maybe he is allowing it so I learn something (in which case I HOPE I learn it quick) or he is going to reward me in some OTHER way down the line if I stick with this and don't faulter."<br>  <br>  JUST last night, My wife was talking to her friend who is going thru a custody battle and having to take her kids to court ordered Psych evaluations, and under go court ordered Psych Evals herself (along with her ex-husband)  -- ALL of which are VERY stressful and scarey. <br>  <br>  YET, she says,  "there must be a reason for all this"... "I wonder what good will come of it?"<br>  <br>  I hear this type of sediment ALL the time.<br>  <br>  My wife and I have gone thru alot as well.   My wife has had SEVERE medical issues since she was 12 years old.  Multiple surgeries the last of which was unsuccessful because her body has created SOO MUCH scarring internally,  the Doctors can't SEE some of her internal organs to perform the surgery.  -- They know they are there..but they are encased or covered up by internal scarring. <br>  My Wife has been bed ridden off and on for the past 12 years. <br>  For a time we blamed God,  BUT lately we have realized that, although we don't understand WHY,  there is an ultimate reason for all this.. we just have to stay the course and see it through. <br>  Since adopting this new view point and rediscovering our faith.. her health has gotten better,  we have more help and support from Friends and Family then we ever did.  We are using her gifts/talents to help people in the community and are happier.<br>  <br>  Good times don't test your faith.  It is EASY to believe in God when life is easy. It is the TOUGH times which prove to you, that your faith is REAL. <br>  Like how metal is made stronger by going thru fire.  -- Likewise, a Christian who goes thru a life crisis and doesn't LOOSE their faith,  comes out the other end, stronger.<br>  The phrase is "Trial by fire"  - If you can survive your trial(s) by fire, your "metal" is forged in fire and is stronger then the rest. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying my wife and I have faced ALL our trials,  but the ones we have,  almost tore us apart, but in the end,  our metal has been tested NOW, and we are stronger for it. -- NOW when issues come along, they won't test us, nearly as much as they would have, had we not had our metal tested.|`|AA11124121	God is God.<br>  <br>  God doesn't make bad things happen. Bad people do.<br>  God doesn't make good things happen. They just do.<br>  Your good news may be my bad news.<br>  <br>  What's God got to do with that?|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	Because they sometimes make no sense.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	All good comes from God, man is the source of all other.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	I will still say "Praise God", because the bible tells me in Romans 8:28, that " all things work out for good to those who love the Lord, and are called according to His purpose"<br>  I trust God that every decisions that He makes over my life, will come out for my good, so since we walk by faith and not by sight, what is the problem ?<br>  I found out that the more I praise Him in a bad situation, the quicker it passes over...|`|Fpi8im9taa	When I've asked this question, Christians were anything but silent.<br>  <br>  "It's sin in this world that caused that plane to kill all those people!"<br>  "It was Satan who caused this tragedy, not God!"<br>  "God saved the Hudson River people because they weren't sinful!"<br>  <br>  etc. and all that crud.<br>  <br>  When something good happens, I praise the person who made that happen, like the doctor who performed chemotherapy on a cancer patient, or the pilot who saved people from dying from a plane crash. When not even the pilot thanks God for what happened, then I know that the pilot was the one who saved people, not God.<br>  <br>  I wonder what they'll say...|`|xxijbx4Waa	hello,<br>  you make a wonderful point,and this is a great question.<br>  when i was spiritually immature,i admit that i was somewhat like the way your describing.as i have grown in my walk,i am able to recognize the lords blessings,or his miracles,as some might say.<br>  an example would be the plane that landed in the hudson...some say that was a miracle.and the ones that crashed....god works in mysterious ways.<br>  that isnt a good way to percieve the way of the lord.<br>  i,for one,embrace tragedies in my own life,and use these as oppourtunities to improve my character,and also recognize that the lord is cultivating my faith.good things happen to bad people,and bad things happen to good people....and so goes the way of life.<br>  sometimes its just human nature to speak the way your decribing.and its easy to blame god for all our struggles.and equally easy to just say "praise the lord,its a miracle."<br>  obviously,we can never fully understand what god's ways are,but we can at least,try to draw a better understanding of his purpose.<br>  some people simply say,things just happen,there is no god.and there is a good point in that statement.<br>  its ridicules to try to categorize each event of the day as "gods plan'or even blame him for events that unfold negativley.|`|fz8PCFRgaa	I disagree.  When terrible things happen we know that God is transforming and when we allow God to work in those things we can be transformed into a people that can use loss and pain for good.  John Walsh is a prime example.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Why is it atheists pray when really in trouble yet they don't go to church, believe in god and abuse christians? Why should prayer work?|`|K24JFTOcaa	silent in prayer|`|ms0eYsD5aa	then they blame the atheists lol|`|YIElevidaa	Not true.<br>  <br>  <br>  They usually say that if something good happens they are being blessed for being righteous, or being tested to see if they could live a "righteous" life in excess and temptation.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  They say that if something bad happens they are being punished for being wicked, or being tested to see if their faith and love for god will hold out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ultimately it's just baseless speculation designed to be a catch all explanation for why good things happen to bad people..the short answer is nobody knows.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's sleeping, maybe christian excuses are true, maybe there is no god, maybe god doesn't care. Most speculation is baseless.|`|aocrUrzLaa	yet if something terrible happens.......praise God for his wisdom to put obstacles in your path that will lead you to be a better person. i have learned much more and become much stronger from the tragedies in my life than i have from the "good". i have learned how to trust in myself and in others (even those i didn't realize were there for me before hand), that in losing a loved one i can survive the heartache, and that if i am only seeking the wonderful that i can miss so many of the little delights that are right in front of me------like warm breezes, the smell of fresh laundry and the sound of my kids playing out in the yard. the good makes you feel happy and the terrible makes you appreciate the good that much more.|`|yLEeFohqaa	Alright, let me enlighten you.  I'm not Buddhist or anything, I'm a Christian. Anyway, we as Christians praise God when there are good things happening and should be praising HIm when bad things happen as well. Have you ever read the book Job(e) in the Bible? It is about a man who loses everything that he has and still praises God. I will admit, we do not always praise God in the storm but we should and that is our fault, however, Christianity is hard and we are human. That is what sets us apart from  God and in all honesty, I think that we should, as a whole human race, praise Him everyday of our lives.|`|AA10860594	No, they will say it was God's will. <br>  Basically, Christians believe that whatever happens is fated by God to have happenned whether for good or bad, and that God works in mysterious ways so we can never really know why something happenned the way it did, but that we as Christians can feel safe knowing that no matter what happens, God is on our side and will take care of us in the end. <br>  If you have trouble understanding it, it might be because you have never felt the strength of God beside you during a really difficult time. It feels very good. Like invisible support, knowing that youre really not alone and never were and never will be.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Cause it sounds funny to thank G-d for a tragedy.  Truly, when praising the Lord for our good fortune, we are merely thanking Him for putting us here, not for granting a wish.  In times of trouble, we simply lean on Him and ask for the strength to carry on.  More miracles are accomplished by sweat than by threat.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	well if your trying to imply that i only love God when life is good you are terribly misinformed..<br>  <br>  i take the good as a gift and the bad as a test, but i thank God for all of it because i know the good and the bad fit perfectly into His plan.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Christian|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Simple, some Christians have black and white logic.<br>  <br>  Good for people Christians like = God<br>  Bad for people Christians like = Satan<br>  Good for people Christians don't like = Satan<br>  Bad for people Christians don't like = God<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|FyBNITUlaa	They have forgotten that Christ taught us to be grateful in all things good and bad, but since I am just a silly Mormon and not a real Christian then maybe that is just what my Christ taught.|`|PWankIUpaa	NO <br>     we say Praise God ! as Paul directs us to .

You can GOOGLE OR YAHOO IT:   To find out, " HOW TO PLAY THE GAME."  There are many different ways to play the game.  The game comes with instructions, but they are hard to understand,(LOST IN TRANSLATION).  CARDINAL'S MEXICAN TRAIN DOMINOES I THINK ARE THE BEST & THE CHEAPEST.  IT COMES IN A TIN BOX.(91 TILES).  "Toys R Us," Sells the game.  The fancier game version, I don't like the tiles, they are dull.  The game can be played with up to 6 people.  I think 3 people playing the game is the best.  It gets harder to play the game with more people.  Solution is to buy 2 games.    Then  buy some snacks.<br>  Maybe you can start a club, (wear silly hats), and play the game once a week with your friends & cousins. <br>  Just Think Your Club Was Started On Your Birthday!

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire could have taken over and converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.<br>  <br>  Point of Order: Vlad Tepes and Elizabeth Bathory were not vampires. They were sadistic tyrants who abused their power to feed their homicidal impulses, but they were humans who lived and died. The act of drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating grass makes you a cow.|`|96AQZUGyaa	Real vampires don't exist and you can't become a real one. You can, of course, meet one of those types that come around here sometimes angsting about their "vampirism" and how they feed off people's energy and that's why they don't have friends (not because they're nutjob creeps who'd nobody go near).|`|jLL7sDILaa	You can meet a real vampire pretty much anywhere.

I too want to know where to find one and i want to become one, but they're too scared to show their faces and say,"Hey I'm a bloodsucking monster" you know what I think, I think that they used to be alive a long time ago like in medieval times but people started killing them and they became extinct and nowadays people started saying they're one of them even though they're not and I have a word for that.

I dont care whether someone is gay or not, but i dont like seeing too much pda no matter what gender is doing it. they think the gay bar is weird because there are probably many men trying to pick your friend up and for many people that would be uncomfortable and others probably wonder why your friend would want that. it's just like racism, nobody is born with the hatred until they realize that others think it is bad to stand out and like a gender within your own sex.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	From your notes I gather that you are straight and you want to take a job at a gay bar, right.  I so hope you get the job.  You are the perfect person to work there.  Doing what you want to do will in all probability help to change the stereotyped thinking about ones sexual orientation.  In our familly one of the cousins is gay and has come out about 2 years ago.  However only to part of the family as he and his parents don't even want to think of what might be said and done by the other half of the family.  So go for it.  You are so right; you are 25 and you can do as you wish.  What you want to do is legal.|`|b08ed93f00d7a03f34011f3266277699aa	They're stereotyping because they're afraid.<br>  Homosexuality was considered a mental disease until 1973.

Because according to you, you have tried to talk to him and reassure him it's NOT like that but he keeps being stubborn and doesnt want to hear any of it. He may not want to hear it b/c he doesnt want any thought running through his head that he might actually enjoy your friendship more than he though. <br>  <br>  Hey, you guys are very comfortable with each other, there's nothing wrong with that. Like you said, its hard to find guys like that. it's rare. tell him what you said here. maybe that might make him understand. just continue to be there for him.|`|BIoCl9Qqaa	i think jenny got it right.  he may have some confrontation with his own identity and his assumption of you making a pass at him could have been to much to handle.  <br>  <br>  i'm going to assume you are gay and he knows? i hope things turn around for you and some time is all he needs.|`|b08ed93f00d7a03f34011f3266277699aa	Just let him chill out for a while. If you guys are so close, He'll come around and realize he'd be losing a precious friendship that's really hard to come by.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|LURqbzoZaa	Well, you should just explain to him that you werent trying to do anything, and tell him how much your friendship means.|`|qqHx4KmMaa	hmm that is a toughy. he threw it away because maybe he is questioning his own sexuality and is rejecting it. if he doesnt listen to a thing you say try writing it down and sending it to him, because nobody can resist a letter no matter how mad they are. curiousity is usually stronger than hatred in any situation. good luck with your friend, i know how hard it is to find someone you really trust... my old best friend turned on me and we havent talked in two years for no reason
AztCTaQlaa	There's nothing you can do if you really want to go as a fairy but then don't want to go because you're not comfortable enough going dressed as a fairy... it seems like a catch 22. I say if you are the rubenesque sort of girl (hubba hubba ^_^ ) and you don't feel comfortable with your size to dress like a fairy then try holding off as a fae, go as a peasant or something this year, lose some weight and go as a fairy next year ^_^  <br>  <br>  The other thing to do is to just go as a fairy as you know there will be alot of people there that are dressing up in stuff they would never were to their local mall and if they can do it without feeling so bad then you might gain courage from it too ^_^<br>  <br>  P.S. If i'm wrong about the 'big' thing ("fat farie") then please excuse my ranting lol. If not just think U2's song "Big Girls are Best", Peter Paul Rubens the painter, and fertility goddesses depicted as very large women and they have been worshipped for centuries ^_~|`|BAlntsndaa	Go as a handmaiden in a pretty dress/hair, or as the royal cook with kerchief and apron and huge wooden spoon with a basket of herbs and potatoes and a rubber chicken?

A great spin-off was getting to 'meet' people who shared a love of books, a curiosity about other people's ways of approaching things, and had absolutely no interest in converting us any more than we (Jews) did them. <br>  <br>  And the next great spin-off was discovering that there were quite a number of others - Hindus, Christians, atheists - who were very supportive of our attempts to spread information rather than DISinfomation.  Hence Jews, Pagans and Allies.<br>  <br>  Despite what some seem to be so convinced by that nothing can shift their views, we are not in any way blending our religions together (bizarre idea!), nor are we in existence to attack Christians or any other group.  <br>  <br>  It's been extremely interesting to find out a bit more about Paganism, and astonishing to discover how easy it's been to explain Jewish concepts to Pagans and to those various others who have been willing simple to read what we say and think about it.  It's also meant that I've learnt a lot more about Christianity, from Christians who respect our points of view!|`|DTog0VZWaa	Everyone else explained it - Ambivalent's answer especially.

f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	The colour of a rosary has no predefined or unified meaning.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	There is not really any meaning to rosary color, though there are some rosaries associated with specific groups. For example, my husband has a black rosary, but it's not the color that makes it special. It's the fact that it has the Knights of Columbus symbol.|`|O1QBA5XSaa	If it's just an ordinary set of rosary beads, they come in many colors, including black; nothing special about it.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	Black is IN dahling! Keep up with the times!|`|hMNOBYHCaa	When I was a kid, black rosaries were for boys and men.  Women and girls got all kinds of pretty colors.  I have a very pretty red one from the Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows.  If the colors mean anything, I don't know what.|`|ZteoS74raa	I don't know much about rosary's.

2DahzSWvaa	Yes, I still believe in the whole soul mate thing. Am I with my soul mate now? Errrrr...ask me when she's done cooking my supper.|`|1TT9oiO0aa	Yes, I genuinely believe it. <br>  <br>  And of course the rule applies to LGBT!!<br>  <br>  I found my soulmate through strange circumstances which, in a way, sealed my belief in finding soulmates through fate. I think you meet people for a purpose and when you meet your soulmate you just "know".|`|LWvh2g2maa	No.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Some, yes.|`|5DhtndSIaa	I believe everyone has "souls" mates.  By that I mean there are numerous people on this planet you could have a loving, lasting relationship with that would meet all the criterion of your definition of "soul mate."  With the billions of available choices in the world it seems unlikely there would be only one match per individual.  Hopefully, you will be able to find those that fit in your life and live a productive and happy existence with them.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	What is Lgbt? is that lesbian gay stuff thing?<br>  <br>  I think everyone has a soulmate @ certain times in their lives...I think that the astro. signs (the ones that try to match you up w/ your soulmate) are fake, so never listen to that or read those articles!<br>  <br>  But anyway, to answer your question in details I definitely believe everyone has a soulmate and that he/she comes around at different times of your life..sometimes people aren't ready for their soulmate which then causes them to be single or date "the wrong" people because they need to be ready for THE SOULMATE. Do you understand?<br>  <br>  As far as the lesbian/gay thing...I can't help you there because I honestly don't know<br>  but best to luck to you|`|eGiLYNlzaa	No i don't think so...I think it just happens. Some people aren't meant to be with other people, like myself. I don't want to ever find anyone more than just a fling or a teenage thing...I don't know. Aeh, that's a hard choice. But maybe i believe in it for everyone else, and of course it applies to LGBT.|`|ze4Gt1araa	Yes I believe every one has a soulmate. :)|`|DWwv3v9Raa	That's what they say, but everyone may not find theirs in life :(|`|1RhiLgmBaa	Yes, and yes.<br>  <br>  SOULmate as in the soul not the gender|`|W545hqrpaa	i hope so because im waiting on my soulmate.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I believe everybody has a soul mate just like I believe everybody has a tooth fairy.  It is a mythological construct that serves no useful purpose in reality.  In reality, you have to seek out and nurture good relationships.  They don't just drop from the sky because they're "soul mates".  There is no fate - the future is not set.  Other than a few vagaries of chance, life is what you make of it, no more and no less.

65QqZBnjaa	First to answer the main question:<br>  <br>  How long?  As long as it takes.  I'm not being flippant, due to a number of factors the time varies from 1 years to decades.  Most people take 3-5 years.  My transition was 4.5 years.<br>  <br>  Now to your other problems:<br>  <br>  Per the Standards of Care (SOC) you may be started on blockers before 16 and estrogen at 16.  Anyone who says no doesn't know what they are talking about OR they are lying to you.  You can down load a copy of the SOC here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.WPATH.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.WPATH.org</a><br>  <br>  Have your therapist write a letter of referral to the endocrinologist stating you are ready for hormone replacement therapy.  It is the therapist's call NOT the endo's.  If one or both do not cooperate you'll need to find new ones.  The letter of referral for HRT usually comes after a minimum of 3 months  evaluation.  Seeing as you have only been going one month you need to be patient.  So to sum up:<br>  <br>  You need to be evaluated by a therapist for at least 3 months.<br>  <br>  Then they MAY write a letter of referral to an endo<br>  <br>  The endo will then evaluate your health, prescribe HRT, monitor your progress and do regular periodic labwork.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|qqHx4KmMaa	wow that is a young age, that is my age! good luck i cant give you any advice haha but i hope all goes well.|`|V5lxDoIRaa	Radgal is correct the S.O.C. states that you can start blockers before you're sixteen, but estrogen can not be prescribed until you are at-least sixteen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>   My transition took 15 years due to financing|`|SuunIshjaa	my girlfriend is pre-op and has been transitioning since 17 she now 26. she has real breasts lovely figure, shes a woman to me even though she has not had sexual reassignment surgery. she said to get this far it took her 3 years.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	It takes a year in therapy for hormones (I think).<br>  And then a year on hormones, then you'll liable to get the surgery.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this information isn't 100% correct.|`|3OZgcntfaa	There's no reason you won't be able to have the blockers shortly after your diagnosis period. The only wait should be for appointments times to open up.<br>  <br>  Once your GP has gotten the correct paperwork from someone with recognized credentials, they can either prescribe you the blockers or refer you to an endocrinologist who will take care it. Some GP's aren't comfortable with dealing in hormones and such because that's a specialty. It's for your safety they send you to a specialist.<br>  <br>  You're already doing the right thing to get hormones. Going to a therapist (who is hopefully qualified to diagnosis you and isn't jerking you around) and talking to your doctor. <br>  <br>  If you don't have the blockers by your sixteenth birthday, you'll have them well before your seventeenth. If not, someone doesn't have your best interests at heart.
Onzxe6ysaa	WOW - That's unbeWEAVEable|`|da4zS4AOaa	Lol I read this story in Mediatakeout.

A lot of women get them because it's better to dye and apply heat to hair that isn't yours than to damage your own hair.  That's why so many celebrities get them, though I don't think that White celebrities get that you're not supposed to KNOW that it's a weave...<br>  <br>  I personally don't like weaves, I've only had tracks in my hair once, and that was for my high school prom 6 years ago.  My real hair is collar length, and that's fine.  I don't like feeling foreign hair in my head.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	wow it stopped a bullet!

9Z1d0i6faa	Many many people smoked during those times (not just the rich and upper class).  It was a popular thing to do (it was considered "cool" ).  One of the main reasons people did it was because people didn't know how bad it actually was to smoke, chew, etc.  At that time, they didn't know all of the negative effects smoking had on the smoker and the people around the smoker.  Just like it used to be fashionable to be a little overweight.|`|DGXQKQdCaa	it was for the upper class and the rich|`|lc9nus8taa	back then it was 'cool' but now its out of fashion
xLKPKgZXaa	No, I hope He never tests me that far.|`|AA11440601	I can only hope.<br>  <br>  Context. Context. Context.<br>  <br>  Abraham lived hundreds of years before the Ten Commandments were given to Moses and the Jewish people.<br>  <br>  Abraham lived in a society where human sacrifice and child sacrifice was the normal thing to do.<br>  <br>  God was just beginning to reveal himself to mankind and Abraham did not have the Bible or much of anything else to go on.<br>  <br>  Abraham knew that his son was a gift from God. If God demanded that Abraham kill the son, then Abraham, although it probably broke his heart, would do it.<br>  <br>  Under the same circumstances (context) would we be able to follow God's will?<br>  <br>  Under the much easier circumstances that we live in today, can we follow God's will as Jesus revealed it to us?<br>  <br>  With the Ten Commandments, the Prophets, and especially Jesus Christ as part of our current circumstances (context), God would not put us to this test.<br>  <br>  But we do have similar issues to tackle, like abortion where we kill our children who are miraculous gifts from God just like Isaac was to Abraham.<br>  <br>  In abortion we sacrifice our children to the gods of lust, convenience, economy, and selfishness.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|I5av9h9naa	What a silly question.  I'm sorry, but it really is laughable.  LOL<br>  <br>  When Harry Potter flew his broom into a thunderstorm, wasn't he showing how contagious he was?

Perhaps you ought to go lookin for both of them...|`|ouXrNitMaa	I was under the impression that "God" is all-knowing. Why would God test someone if they already know the outcome? Not logical.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Abraham was being tested to see if he would do Gods will. For Abraham keep Gods commandments .God new that Abraham would do his will. And God never had any indentation  for Abraham to take his sons life. Only a test of faithfulness, how about you are you willing to do the will of the lord and keep his commandments and follow the example of Jesus Christ are you faithful unto God .|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	Look ... Abraham hadn't believe in God easily ... first he refused to believe in those gods which his people built statues to them and worshiped ...<br>  <br>  So Abraham tried to search for God ..and when he saw the star , he thought that it is God ..but when he saw the moon he found it bigger so it might be his god ..but when the sun raised ..he became convinced that God must be the Biggest and Greatest than anyone could imagine ...so He believed in God Who created all the world by its secret ... ok ...<br>  <br>  At that time people used to sacrifice by their sons in order to their gods ... so while God taught Abraham The Religion ..He asked Him to sacrifice with his son such as the other people as a kind of testing his faith .... <br>  <br>  Of course Abraham was strongly believing in God ..so he obeyed Him ...<br>  <br>   but God didn't need to kill the human being ..God wanted to teach Abraham how to sacrifice to Him, not as the people did by following the satan and killing their sons ...no ..God is Sympathy and Almighty .. needn't to our blood ... <br>  <br>  This was a kind of miracle to teach Abraham  and award him ...he obey God , so God save his son ...|`|mk4fqufAaa	i wish i had it no, but then he was the prophet the Messenger he had to have that level of faith and for us it has become an example for us for centuries only because he had that high  level.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	Well, I don't have any children, (wish I could have) but I don't think the Lord would ask us to do that, since He actually sacrificed His perfect Son for our sins.<br>  I love God so much, but honestly,  I don't what I would do if He asked me to make that sacrifice. I would hope I would make the choice that pleased the Lord, like Abraham did, and that God would not ask us to make that decision.<br>  I think He already gave so much to us with Jesus, that we should do whatever He asks.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	God will never ask a single person to do that again.  It was one time, to be a picture of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for our sins.  :)|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I really would hope I would.  That's why its called faith.  I've never been tested like that before though.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	No. I ditched my imaginary friends in grade school.|`|6Y3mW1a2aa	No, I wouldn't sacrifice my son for some mean God.|`|O0PrBp7Yaa	No one can truly know that until they're in that situation. <br>  It's like saying that you're a good person and you'd honestly fess up if you committed a crime. When you get in that situation, however (having committed a crime), and face the prospects, you might just get scared and change your mind, claiming innocence that is false.<br>  Likewise, being visited by 'God' would change a lot of things and evoke different emotions and thoughts. <br>  Nevertheless, if one were to be visited by 'God' himself (if they were religious), their faith would most likely be pretty strong at that point. And seeing as though hes a 'loving God,' (Christianity-wise) the one he asks would probably trust him.<br>  Personally, I don't really think you'll need to worry about that. ;)|`|r7iEpP6Kaa	All I could say to an honest answer would be.<br>  "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak"|`|AA11992885	if i KNEW it was God and not just my imagination.......sure, easily|`|k3LbhASGaa	if I talked to God face to face like Abraham then yes
K24JFTOcaa	it don't.  notice how their avoiding the question?|`|Ne9rXERpaa	What ARE you babbling about?<br>  <br>  All we're asking for is EVIDENCE -- just a single fact will do -- in support of any of your book's claims about the supernatural.<br>  <br>  All the other stuff about the absence of dinosaurs and microbes and everything else is just extra coats of varnish on the coffin.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	It doesn't have to say anything, however one would just expect a book from a divinely inspired source to get the few things it does say correct.|`|BFcVLRc2aa	Why does my Nana have facial hair!!!!!?|`|eDAg5OnTaa	huhhhhhhhhhh|`|1ehmRBruaa	But Stephen King indicates that his books are fiction he doesn't try to mislead you by making you think that his stories are true.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Yes but I also wouldn't expect Stephen King to say that bats are birds, or that whales are fish.  If Stephen King makes failed prophecy its no big deal, the bible doing it is a big deal.|`|b4c9e2b92e1f026eefef2790f5184d75aa	Then how come Christians state Dinosaurs didn't exist because it wasn't in the bible?|`|QzRLHXZ9aa	Yes, that's all it is.... a fictional STORY.|`|e6nKOQO2aa	thats rude the Bible tails of stories and truths that did happen for all we know Dinasours could have been real|`|M4WIWMgBaa	It doesn't have to but just because it doesn't speak about these other things does not mean it is grounds to dismiss them. The bible didn't mention heart transplants but xtians believe in them.....
YZv8Ub3Haa	1. Ouija boards are toys that let you communicate with your subconscious mind - a well known psychology effect called the ideomotor effect ( <a href="http://ln-s.net/23Ih" rel="nofollow">http://ln-s.net/23Ih</a> ).<br>  <br>  2. There's nothing evil or supernatural about them.<br>  <br>  3. Superstitious folk are afraid of them because they feel they may attract ghosts, demons or spirits (none of these exist, of course).<br>  <br>  4. In reality, they're as dangerous as chess boards.<br>  <br>  5. Strangely, when the participants are blindfolded and the board is turned around, the ghosts/demons are confused. Why do you think that happens? (Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA5uYhXpa-E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA5uYhXpa...</a> , 2 minutes in).|`|v1tHjJ3haa	Ya, don't play or mess with it, mt mom knew some kids that played with it and the house -all of it inside- lit on fire and the kids barely made it, also there was this friend my mom had she decided to get it and after she bought it put it in the car weird things started to happen like the air seemed heavy, she heard moises like there was someone moving stuff around in her car but she was the only person there, there were knock on her trunk but she was driving so she returned it-never played with it- and nothing like that happened again. It's demonic, it originated as a medium to contact spirits -which are demonic- and it's like necromancy. I believe that it's not subconcious stuff it's spiritual, and I would never allow myself to risk exposure to that kind of stuff, I've read a book on the ouija board. Also my cousin -male- played it with another of my cousins -I wasn't involved or near their house or anything when it took place- and I asked him if he would ever do it again and he said don't play with it, it's evil, but he couldn't expalin to me why, it was just a feeling after playing it. My other cousin just thinks it was stupid weird and fun and she has played it about 2-3 times that I'm aware of.<br>  <br>  Also they sell the board as a game so that the government could get a sales tax on it, I really am serious! People sell voodoo dolls everywhere so why not sell the board as a game!? So that kind of stuff is real.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying to trust my cousins I'm just writing what they've told me and the cousin who told me not to play with it is not a serious kind of guy.<br>  <br>  Tim then those aren't true Christians cause the Bible condems this stuff and those communicating spirits are of the anti-christ and look you spelled all the names in lower case letters and if anyone would like to know what happened to alice cooper than e-mail me or look up his name and also check out David Benoit !|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Take a scientific approach:  Devise a double blind test where you "Ask" the board questions with specific answers not known to the participants or anybody in the room with the participants.  I assure you if this is done properly the board will not give any meaningful answers.|`|AA11124121	Well, the time to worry is when you place the planchette on the board, and it moves and spells with noone touching it.|`|ntdhO8wsaa	If it were real, they wouldn't be selling it at Wal-Mart for 20% off. <br>  <br>  It isn't real.|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	My dreams tell me much more than a Ouija board ever could...|`|atDbSj5Saa	Some people can really get carried away by the magic of make-believe; that's why it's fun.

This subconscious behavior is known as ideomotor action, a term coined by William Carpenter in 1882. It is also known as automatism. Some people may be convinced that the "powers" of the ouija board are real because they are unaware that they are in fact moving the piece and therefore assume that the piece must be moving due to some other "spiritual force". The subconscious thought process may produce an answer that is different from what the user expected in their conscious thought process—thus perpetuating the idea that the board has "mystical powers". Penn & Teller: Bullsh*t! episode on Ouija Boards, ran an experiment using unbiased participants. Questions were being asked to the late William Frawley with very strong answers. The participants were then blindfolded and the board was turned 180 degrees without their knowledge.

6660bd3487fdb3fab7958bd2216d1e06aa	I think it is a good/great thing to learn to like to be by yourself. Especially since you seem young - learning to like being alone is one of the most freeing experiences I have ever had. Its healthy to not have people around all the time, if you can do that as a choice I think you will learn to not make alot of "needy" type decisions that you end up regretting!

But ignorant people will come up with anything to criticize. Maybe they ate food cooked by a British person once that they didn't enjoy and jumped to that conclusion. Or maybe they went to Britain and didn't like a lot of the food there. Different cultures have different foods. I don't like a lot of Asian foods, but that doesn't mean that Asian people can't cook - it just means I don't personally like what they DO cook. But some people, as I said, are probably too ignorant to differenciate between the two.|`|aocrUrzLaa	i once heard of a food critic saying that God had blessed the British with much, unfortunately taste buds weren't one of them. i have a few British friends, and after eating their cooking i am convinced that bland food must be the norm in their society. though one of my friends did say that it was easier for each person to spice their own food than it was to take out the spice once it was in.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	I have heard people say this.<br>  <br>  I have worked along side some British Army Cooks working in Canada.  I found their food loaded with butter, fat and oil.  I never had too much of their food because they made it for the british troops and there wasn't much left over.  So they must enjoy their own food.<br>  <br>  I asked for french toast once and the British cook dipped the bread in egg then put it in the deep fryer.

Example, Mukjizats were given to Prophet Moses to lead the Hebrews across The Sea of Reeds from Eygpt to Peninsula Sinai. To win over the snakes by the Pharaohs Priests and given at that occasion only. To Prophet Jesus Christ, to give life to the dead, to cure illness. to cure blindess. These too, during that period only. These Mukjizat given while the prophets still living. In the case of Al-Qur'an Nur Karim, it was given to Prophet Muhammad Sallallahhu'alaihi Wassalam and to all Muslims.

145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	You are doing his laundry - yet he goes psycho over loosing $5?  If he dropped his clothes off at a fluff and fold place they'd probably charge him $50!<br>  <br>  I'd give the money back to him.  Honest is always the best policy.<br>  <br>  However, his reaction to your joke would raise a red flag in my opinion.  Is he compensating you in anyway for your time and the expenses of the utilities, the soap and the wear and tear of the machines?  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  No man is worth being taken advantage of.  If he doesn't make it worth your while to do his laundry I would stop doing it.  He can learn to do it himself.|`|xnsU60hhaa	Your house, your rules.<br>  In MY house, the rule is: Leave money or anything else in your pockets and it is now the property of whomever is doing the laundry.<br>  Your boyfriend sounds pretty petty if he is that upset over $5. Find yourself a REAL man who will spend money on you and make you feel like a queen!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Just give it back.  It belongs to him.  I personally, have told my hubby that I will keep from pennies up to a quarter, as my payment for his laundry.  More than that goes back to him.|`|AA10819407	After reading your whole post....Keep the money, he sounds to selfish and lazy to move out on his own....Won't even go to the laundry mat??? You are also not his personal dry cleaner.It is running up your <br>  electric bill, laundry detergent( I'm guessing you supply all the laundry supplies?)<br>    Personally, I think you need to give him and his laundry the boot.<br>     You deserve someone who will give back to you as much as you give to them, and does not live at home...( his poor mother)|`|dPULl5hjaa	I would you bf any money back.<br>  <br>  Also, I would quit doing his laundry.  He doesn't sound appreciative!<br>  <br>  Let his parents do his laundry or learn how to do it himself!<br>  <br>  Your bf is lousy.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I would certainly keep it because I would NEVER do a bf's laundry.|`|qzBKYa3Taa	I'd never do that, my boyfriend always buys me stuff (just little things, drinks etc) and I never begrudge spending money on him.<br>  Chances are he'd prob let me keep it anyway, or make me go buy beer for him lol.<br>  <br>  ~<br>  ok note taken.  I still don't think you should just keep it, if you have problems with him you should discuss them properly.<br>  Even though you probably do deserve to keep the money, it wont help your situation by doing so.  You stay as the good person by doing favours for love and he should realise this.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I'd give it back.  You don't know if he plans on using that $5 to buy lunch at work or something and forgot it was in his pocket.<br>  <br>  However, if the guy is rarely spending money on you and letting you do his laundry (without helping you or offering to do your laundry), the dude is a bum.  Don't be his mommy.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	I can't believe you're even asking this. It's his money. Why on earth would you even begin to think that you had any right to keep it for yourself?

That's nice of you to do his laundry.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	No, you should give it back. You found the $ but it's obviously not yours. He probably forgot to check his pockets before putting the jeans in his hamper. :-||`|AA11765580	Um, if you want any kind of trust in your relationship, you need to give him is money back.|`|sqdsIHwAaa	give it back|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	If he had that attitude with me, I'd definitely stop doing his laundry, I know that much for sure.  And in my house, any money that finds its way into the laundry becomes the property of the person who is doing the laundry and finds it.  We all know it and live by it.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  We alternate doing laundry chores, so it could be a different person finding the money each time.  You'd be surprised how a rule like that will get people to check their pockets before just tossing their clothes in the laundry basket or on the washer.  If they don't want their money lost, they either check their pockets OR do their own laundry.  I don't see anything unfair about that.  <br>  <br>  I'd be a bit concerned about the boyfriend's attitude towards money though -- sounds like he had an over the top reaction to your teasing about it.|`|YUq2kwxJaa	With me and my husband (and my in laws and such) when we all lived together the rule was -If you find money in the laundry room it gets put in a jar- and the money in the jar goes towards household items (laundry detergent, soap, toilet paper.. etc) Im sure many people pocketed the money but I never did even if I found it in my clothes, teaches me to check my clothes before taking them down to the laundry room..<br>  <br>  Now since we've moved n I go to the laundry place I always check before I leave the house.|`|AA11065140	Well, after hearing him say, "I can't believe you would take money from me,", I would have had to reply with, "I can't believe you're letting me do your freaking laundry!".<br>  <br>  And then I'd give him the money back.  It is his, after all, and since it's only $5, it's not worth fighting over.|`|WfYfF8CLaa	I think he is a tight sob and can't take a joke.   I like the rule that if you put it in the wash then whoever is doing the wash gets to keep it.  This makes common sense.    But the deeper issue is that he get all wiggy over a stupid $5 bill.  You should examine your relationship with this guy and see if he is really worth it if he reacts this way.    If he acts so strange over such a minor thing, he may have what we call .... a screw loose.|`|rpzHSaI9aa	Of course you give it back... it's his money!!!! If you found money in his wallet would you give it back or keep it...?<br>  Maybe you could set a rule for the future though... if he leaves money in his pockets it becomes yours... and then you won't have to worry about checking his pockets when you do the laundry!|`|AA11537580	why are you doing his landry?<br>  make him do his own landry<br>  are you living together?<br>  just put anything you find in his pockets in a cup next to the washer/dryer in your house, that's what I do.|`|my6AKy6Eaa	wow are you serious I would so give it back. hello honesty.

The current (265th) pope is Pope Benedict XVI, who was elected April 19, 2005 in papal conclave.<br>  <br>  The office of the pope is called the Papacy; his ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the "Holy See" (Sancta Sedes in Latin) or "Apostolic See" (the latter on the basis that both St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred at Rome). In addition to his spiritual role, the pope is Head of State of the independent sovereign state of the Vatican City, a city-state entirely enclaved by the city of Rome.<br>  <br>  Early popes helped spread Christianity and resolve doctrinal disputes. At first, the pope's secular ally was the Roman Emperor. In the 8th century, however, Pope Stephen II was forced to appeal to the Franks for help, beginning a period of close interaction with the rulers of the West. For centuries, the forged Donation of Constantine also provided the basis for the papacy's claim of political supremacy over the entire former Western Roman Empire. In medieval times, popes played powerful roles in Western Europe, often struggling with monarchs for power over wide-ranging affairs of church and state, crowning emperors (Charlemagne was the first emperor crowned by a pope) and regulating disputes among secular rulers.<br>  <br>  Gradually forced to give up secular power, popes have come to focus again almost exclusively on spiritual matters. Over the centuries, popes' claims of spiritual authority have been ever more clearly expressed since the first centuries, culminating in the proclamation of the dogma of papal infallibility for those rare occasions the pope speaks ex cathedra (literally "from the chair (of Peter)") when issuing a solemn definition of faith or morals. The last such occasion was in the year 1950 with the definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	because Paul was right there and Peter, the 1st Pope, was not<br>  <br>  Peter is the leader of the Apostles in Acts<br>  <br>  God bless|`|AA11124121	open your Bible to the Acts of the Apostles.<br>  <br>  What you seek to know is there.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	Peter was not a Pope
zPfgFXU5aa	In Bible times to do something "in someone's name" meant doing something with the authority of that person.<br>  <br>  You weren't just using their name as in name dropping, the person concerned had actually authorized you to act on their behalf in a certain manner or to use their power to do something.<br>  <br>  The Roman Governor in the Holy Land was therefore governing in the name of Caesar, the Apostles were acting in the name of jesus and so on.<br>  <br>  We are told in Mark 9:38-41 that the man John saw was acting in the name of Jesus. This means that although none of the Apostles had met him before, he was nevertheless doing miracles with the authority and by the approval of Jesus. <br>  <br>  There were others, besides the apostles, whom the Lord sent to urge the Jews to repent. The seventy, for instance, were among that number (Luke 10:1). Jesus doubtless empowered the seventy to cast out demons. Jesus also gave the apostles power over demons when he sent them out on a similar mission (Matt. 10:5-8). <br>  <br>  The seventy preached the same message as the twelve-not a different plan or purpose and they were fully authorised by Jesus to do that. <br>  <br>  This man in Mark 9:38-41was therefore one of the seventy who none of the 12 Apostles had met yet which is why they didn't know him. <br>  <br>  There is nothing in the Bible to suggest that the Apostles were authorised to transfer their power to do miracles to anyone else so not everyone back them could do signs and wonders, only those who Jesus himself had authorised to act in his name and that is why we can't just mention his name and get a miracle on demand like some kind of cosmic dial-a-miracle service.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Because the Christianity of those times are completely unnecessary now; it's not needed.

Why not today, depends at what place of worship one attends (in the Pentecostal church we still do this) and most of all, if the person laying hands on the sick (sick as in any sickness even cancer) does believe in Jesus.  for those that cast out the demons and  did not follow them did believe in Jesus and those that were chased out by the demons did not know Jesus, if you recall they said in the name Paul.......they did not know Jesus and so today even if the person  would like to see a healing they do not because he or she do not really believe.   <br>  As you share here--even the demons believed, those that do not will get hurt and can very well get possessed by the demon he or she is trying to cast out of the sick person (the one possessed) so if the person is not ready or really believes in Jesus he or she should not try to cast out a demon.  <br>  My aunt had cancer and she was going in for therapy--surgery to remove what could be removed and than treated with radiation; the church--members laid hands on her; she went to get one last scan of the cancer and there was nothing; the doctors dismissed it as a misdiagnosis--typical of the unbeliever fro they see God in this but they believe not.|`|cdFqekzZaa	The miracles were tribal magic.

Made up stories.|`|664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	There are two items you need to consider for you question -- miracles and the power of Satan.<br>  <br>  During the time of Christ, Jesus and His Apostles were making outlandish claims like they were speaking and acting on behalf of God.  The Jews clearly understood that Jesus actually claimed to be the Son of God -- the Christ.  The ONLY way that people were going to believe their claims was if they could PROVE they had been given abilities only God could give.  They had to have power over nature and even death itself.<br>  <br>  So the purpose of the miracles was to prove the word of God, during the time the word was given.<br>  <br>  Jesus gave the ability to perform miracles to His Apostles.  The Apostles also had the ability to pass on the gift of miracles to whom they wanted by laying on of hands.  However, the ability to perform miracles could not be passed on except by the Apostles.  After they all died, there was no more passing on.  Today we can see the effects that their miracles had of proving their teachings were from God -- we are now almost 2,000 years later and their words are still taught!<br>  <br>  Secondly, there is the matter of misc people performing "miracles" in Jesus' name and the matter of dragons, etc.  Satan is referred to symbolically as a dragon and it is told that the dragon is bound for 1,000 years.  The phrase "1,000 years" just means for a period of time (a long time for us) but not necessarily a literal 1,000 years.  Prior to Satan being bound (happened with the resurrection of Jesus), Satan had more powers on the earth.  He was able to possess people.  He or the people he had given power to could un-possess people in Jesus name if he was trying to trick people to follow them.  He had who knows what powers (make a snake talk for example).  However, during this period of time (nowadays), he is bound -- he does not have the powers he had previously.  From the behavior of many of the people in the world, it seems that evil is on cruise control anyway.<br>  <br>  So anyways ... we do not have miracles to confirm the word of God because that era is past.  It has already been done.  We have eye witness acounts of it recorded for us in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps your understanding.  I suggest you study it some more.  Don't just take my word for it.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Research and study it.  Figure it out.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s.  I am not saying that God does not have the ability to perform extraordinary things.  I believe He does and has in my own life.  However, I would not call them miracles because they are not confirming a new teaching from God as the miracles did in a VERY MUCH PUBLIC WAY.  The things God has done for me are in a very much private way, because of their subjectivity, I would not try to convince someone about God based on MY FEELINGS.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I think it still can and does happen today.

White people in the USA are far better of as an ethnic group than any other ethnic group. Also, although people like to believe hispanics face no racial hatrid mexican immigrants fromwhat iv seen face an awful lot of it.<br>  <br>  Not an equal society yet but at least things are moving slowly in the right direction.

If she says no, you guys will be friends anyways.<br>  2. Wether she says yes or no, she will be really happy and honoured that you wanted to ask her out.<br>  3. From what your saying she clearly likes you as more than just a friend.<br>  4. And ofcourse, if you don't ask-- You'll NEVER know.<br>  <br>  So take my advice, ask her out, if she says no, you can move on<br>  +there are plenty more fish in the sea..<br>  <br>  <br>  IF SHE SAYS YES<br>  well have fun:) <br>  and remember, i helped :)<br>  <br>  Hope all that helped!!!<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>  <br>  Gossip Girl
W4UjWKQtaa	Just be yourself. I'm Hispanic and people also tell me I'm "whitewashed" because I like to read and speak proper English. In high school other Hispanic girls thought I was "trying to be something" because I was in Honors and AP. Those girls give in to the stereotype that is expected of minorities, and following these negative stereotypes can only be hurtful because unfortunately in the real world you need to be able to communicate well in order to gain respect and be a successful educated person. I'm now in college getting ready to enter Dental School and most of those girls never made it past high school.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	These are not the behaviors of white people, they are the behaviors of self-respecting, classy people. If I were you, I would tell them that it is insulting to all african americans to imply that they can't have class, breeding, or self-respect. Class knows no race, self respect knows no color. I applaud you for maintaining your composure when surrounded by the racism of your friends. And by the way, white or black, trash is trash. I'm  sure your friends would find it upsetting if some white girl talked or acted trashy and people told  her she was "acting black". Don't let it get to you. Adversity makes us stronger.|`|hMNOBYHCaa	Anytime you lump everyone of a certain ethnicity, race or gender into one big basket, you're guilty of prejudice.<br>  <br>  The characteristics you describe suggest people with a little bit of class and breeding.  There are people of every possible ilk who will fit into this group.<br>  <br>  There are also plenty of white people who act loud and vulgar.  We tend to call them red necks, although that's not so much an insult anymore.  It's kind of taken on a jingoistic tone for red blooded American.<br>  <br>  Is crossing your legs considered vulgar?  Just be a lady and keep decent.  Don't worry about people whose opinions don't matter anyway.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	generally speaking, yes, being proper and well mannered has usually been associated with being white.|`|Dujw71Muaa	Just brush it off and say thank you. When they say that, you didn't become any of that. You're you, a human.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	People who think you 'act/talk white' don't have a clue.<br>  <br>  You're a 'lady'....of which there are in all races.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	they are the characteristics of a lady. while they're doin' their thang (no offence) you are presenting yourself properly and acting like a true lady. it's not white, it's respectable.|`|rx20pKgOaa	In my years of experience, (of which I have had a few :) I have found that class and education set one apart much more than race. Historically, wealthy, white Europeans set the standards for education and social class.  That's not racist - just a statement of history. Now, when an individual lives a moral lifestyle and values education and manners they are labeled as somehow betraying their culture.  <br>  <br>  And yet, education and conduct are the means for improving one's role in society.  I greatly admire Condoleezza Rice.  She comes from a family that has valued education and moral conduct since before the civil war.  Has she gone "white?"  Hardly.  When more cultures and ethic groups value education over gangsta, rap, and easy money it won't be "white" - it will just be classy.|`|2MUZQGMBaa	Yeah, people tell me that I act white too, it's so annoying. I just ignore them, they're ignorant. Just be yourself, that's what I do and I don't care what anyone else thinks.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	I'm not sure how you 'act' white. You sound like someone who acts educated with self respect. Good for you, let the others be posers and see who succeeds.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	It's that type of mentality that keeps the black race down. Same thing happens in Mexican culture. If you're not a gangster low-life, you must be white washed.....
DgEIeREbaa	It is your commitment ceremony; make it your own! If you want your best friend beside you, do it! The only recommendation I would have is that if you both decide to have a "bridal party" have an even amount. It looks better for pictures.<br>  Is the bridal party men only or men and women? If it is both, you could have the women wear gold dresses. The men could wear black suits with gold ties, or some gold accents somewhere. <br>  I hope this helps!|`|BIoCl9Qqaa	for sure you need a party.  why wouldn't you?  <br>  i'm not good with colors, can't help you there.  the white and gold sounds nice.|`|qLb81FkPaa	Go for it...

tvSr6OaNaa	To leave in fear is to be afraid of every thing.<br>  To fear God is to respect Him , to honor Him, to obey his <br>  commendments|`|NmsBFeNJaa	Fear is  fear, no matter the reason, no matter why. If you fear God then you are living in fear. Some people choose to live moral, clean, good lives because they feel it is the right thing to do and forget the consequences or benefits. Some chose to live the same type of life out of fear of God and the afterlife. I see no reason to live in fear, to fear God. I don't know how he could be this vengeful being that everyone makes him out to be.<br>  So they are the same. Fearing God IS living in fear.|`|wySp1kqfaa	when we fear for everything, we search for god.fear of losing wealth, fear of becoming poor, of being marginalized, of our bosses, promotions, status etc,etc.the fear of riches are different from the fear of the poor.fear shun sane thinking and making one weak and meek.where there is fear there is no love.there is nothing called dark, only lack of light.there is nothing called fear only lack of love. and love is god.then there is no question of fearing god.|`|c6RBE32baa	Fearing God means that u acknowledge that someone mightier than u is present who would award u for all your good deeds and punish for your sins. It is a sign of giving respect to God.<br>  Living in fear is being afraid of every situation or circumstances. This shows that u do not have any trust in God.|`|EVSwa73Caa	The fear in the world is different from the fear of God.<br>  <br>  you see no one in this world likes to think about the things they fear for it frightens them and gives them chills, but a world with out fear would be a very difficult one. For even in animals fear plays a major role in there life because it brings a response of fight or flight when it comes to danger and is necessary for their survival. <br>  <br>  Fear with out a doubt is most important when it come to the fear of God. For it is this fear, when understood, that calms all other fears you have in your life and brings you close to God not takes you away from God. Many people don't understand this and they tend to believe that God is the least of beings that should be feared for he is good and loving that he can't possible do us any harm. That is why such people miss out in the love and peace they seek for they live there life full of fear: fear of failure, economy, debt, government, health, death, and so on. <br>  <br>  You see the fear of God is understanding that he is all powerfully in which it takes you to be obedient to his word and be in his path. Such fear brings you peace, joy, love and so many things that God promises and gives to all that are faithful to him. That is why it takes away any other fear there can ever exist for you know that God is in total control of things and since you are in his path nothing and no one can harm you.<br>  <br>  When you live a live in fear since you have nothing you can go to or no one to help you out you always are hidding, miserable, poor and things tend to always go wrong. You get depressed, sick and your life as the days go by is getting in a much deeper deeper hole than what it starts in.<br>  <br>  That is the differences. Hope this helped. God Bless!|`|4LeHbW2raa	I think the difference lies in the cause of the fear. The reason we "live in fear " is because we are afraid of what might happen to us if we don't toe the line i.e we fear physical/mental harm. We know that this world is governed by a set of rules and breaking them ,even when it is justified, will lead to misery. Rebelling against society or its rules usually proves fruitless and people who try to do so end up as  pariahs , are ridiculed and forgotten. So most of us keep quiet and get on with or lives . Even when we know that injustice is being done we can't find the courage to stand up for what we believe in. That is living in fear.<br>   Before we start " fearing God  " we have to start loving God and understanding his love for us . God loves us unconditionally . No matter how many times we screw up He is willing to give us another chance ( if we let Him) . Once we experience that perfect love in the deepest reaches of our being we understand what it means to be liberated . Then we do not fear physical harm . Our only fear is that we will betray God's love or let Him down. That is fearing God.|`|FyBNITUlaa	There are two different meaning of fear in the bible, to be afraid is of the devil but to fear God is to uphold him and to know that he is the Almighty.|`|SWlYChEEaa	those  who are living with/in fear able to try to fearing everything(even the god also)<br>  but they can't able to fear the god coz god is security,dare,love|`|uK3tkaOJaa	Barely any difference|`|c2170e63431913ddc07c51fd5cefc81eaa	the fear of God brings repentance,the fear of anything else is tormenting,|`|HbCWNCQzaa	to have a fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom|`|jdRKZe18aa	Being God fearing means to honor, respect, love and obey God in our lives.<br>  <br>  Living in Fear denotes being AFRAID or scared - God does not want us to be afraid of Him.  He loves us, He wants us to be happy - He wants us to LOVE HIM and not FEAR.  "My peace I leave unto you" said Christ... "Not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be AFRAID".....|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	I have a feeling you already know but I will give it a go. Fearing God is a respect for who he is and the mightyness of His power. Basically putting Him where He belongs on the all authority chain. Living in fear is a life strangling condition that prevents you from being all you are made to be. We are to be bold in Christ and trust Him to provide our needs. Now as far as the boogie man goes, you are own your own :-)|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	Fearing God is actually holding Him in awe, not being afraid of Him. Living in fear is being afraid for you life, that someone might hurt you or kill you. Two very different ways to live and diametrically opposed.|`|89MKzLl3aa	To fear God is to respect Him and to put  Him in the highest honor. I don't want to abandon Him and be judged to eternal separation from Him. But, I don't live in fear.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Awe of God ,"fear of the Lord", casts out fear<br>  They are opposites|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Respect vs. Terror|`|tvWm1e4naa	if you have fear in GOD, you believe in His teachings and do things according to His teachings. You Fear to do bad things because you know it will displease Him. It is a good feeling because it makes you a good person and gives you direction and light in life. <br>  Living in fear is the opposite. I don't see any reason why a person would live in fear unless he did something really bad and his conscience or  the law is haunting him. Could also be that the person living in fear has been abused and has no power to do something about it.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	Fear of God is respect and reverence for the Creator and His holiness, perfection, omnipotence, omniscience and righteousness.<br>  <br>  Living in fear is living without hope in a life apart from God.|`|eDAg5OnTaa	my grandmother always said the the fear of God is the beginning of knowledge. the fear of God to me is Levin according to his ways and someone living in fear is someone who is always afraid all the time.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	You can fear God by respecting Him for what He is or you can fear God for what He can do.<br>  <br>  He can bless you or He can blast you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/fear">http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dic...</a>|`|bglr4m0Naa	Fearing God is like worship, respect, reverence, fotitutde.... living in fear is a form of cowardliness.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	Fearing God = having Faith in God's omnipotence.<br>  <br>  Living in Fear = having no faith|`|U1lmbP7kaa	If your living in fear you fear everything, if you fear god, well the just silly|`|K24JFTOcaa	fear = respect<br>  <br>  having a respect for God and His creation <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  living in fear is being afraid all the time, something you don't have when you know God

da4zS4AOaa	I don't watch "Inside Africa" either. Well majority of Africa is poor so they can show whatever they want. But at the same time they  need to show the city areas.

I was also asked "do you guys wear clothes"? argh <--This was when I was in high school. It doesn't happen to me in college anymore. Thankfully!<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes it's majority of Africa.

I went in 2005 after I graduated college.  Many cities in South Africa have a way better economy than America, and the students excel very well in Academics.  I've been to Durban, Pretoria, Cape Town and few other cities.  American television seems to only showcase countries that give us technology or resources.  Like China, Japan, or they showcase what is supposed to be a romantic get away or the best place to visit like France, Italy, and Greece.   We Americans know Africa is some countries suffer from poverty and AIDs is rapidly spread throughout certain areas, but as big as Africa is, why not show the positives?  I also feel Americans like to doubt that other countries(like countries in Africa) aren't as developed or civilized as we are.|`|DHiqm9Ojaa	I'm not African but I think I can understand you.

Plus, Africa is where many diamonds form and we really see alot of jewlery in America, but you guys in Africa don't get any credit for being the ones to form the diamonds for the jewlery.<br>  <br>  If I were you then I'd feel really mad, but you know that Africa is a pretty place and as long as you believe that, then you and your family don't need to care about what other people say.

If people are talking about God, with the capital "G", they are most likely referring to either the Christian deity, or in the case of the Bahá'í Faith, to a basic monotheistic deity. There is a strong Christian presence here, so I usually take the capital "G" as a reference to the Christian deity, unless the poster states otherwise.

Yeast can sexually reproduce.  Plants are technically alive.  So are worms.<br>  <br>  I think the most important issue is whether or not a creature has cognition and can feel pain.  While I find late-term abortions cruel, a zygote is a mass of cells with no thought, feeling, cognition, pain receptors, or brain.  We kill bacteria every day when we clean.  Are we committing murder every time we do the laundry or scrub the toilet?  A very early pregnancy is only that advanced.  If we count the potential for life a murder, no woman can ever have a period, and no man can ever leak in his sleep.  Those things are kind of unavoidable.<br>  <br>  You also have to consider that life really isn't always a gift.  There are diseases in which a newborn will survive only a few days, and those days, not matter how much drugs you pump into them, will be spent in unending agony.  With Harlequin Ichtiosis, a baby will live a few hours, and for that time, they will feel as if they are in a continuously burning fire.  If you knew a child was going to have something like that (I believe it's possible to tell, but I'm not an expert.)  I think most people would agree that an abortion would be a kind gesture.<br>  <br>  I like that you ask without condemnation or rudeness.

T9F3gILuaa	If I were your boyfriend, I would want you to tell me if you were raped.  It would be probably be hard to tell him, but he should understand.  A good boyfriend should be there in a circumstance such as this.  If he were a true boyfriend, instead of getting angry that you told him you were rapped, he should be there as supportive as he can be.  If he gets mad, angry, or expresses hate against you, he is a jerk and you don't deserve him.  If you have been raped, you need a friend there to help you get through this.|`|LURqbzoZaa	Hmm. They probably should know. I would tell him, but I guess it depends on what type of person he is. Do you think it would make a difference if you told him? If he hates you for that, then he isnt worth being with.|`|bHummJSHaa	If your boyfriend is a true friend it will hurt him if you tell him because he loves you and will feel your pain. But it will hurt him even more if you don't tell him and he finds out from someone else. The sharing of one's pain is an essential part of a good relationship. If I were you I would give him the chance to care for and support you.
AA10435823	G-d delights in showing mercy, Micah says.  Show mercy gladly. <br>  <br>  G-d is truthful.  Be truthful.  <br>  <br>  G-d is full of integrity.  Treat people honestly. <br>  <br>  G-d gives people the freedom to make their own choices.

Put the Tanakh and the New Testament deeply inside by thinking over what He has said.  <br>  <br>  Walk in faith.  See the good up ahead that is coming.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	There actually is a logical answer based on faith.<br>  <br>  If I believe God created the universe it means that he created all matter.  The laws of physics tell us that Time exists as property of the existence of matter.<br>  <br>  Since God created matter it would stand that he exists outside of matter and therefore outside of time.<br>  <br>  God exists in a non-linear ever present "now".<br>  <br>  This is how we can say he has always been.  A logical belief based on faith.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	God has been her since the beginning of time. Its not a question of why.|`|AA11849917	This question is asked more times than I can even count.<br>  <br>  First, it is God, not "god".<br>  <br>  But if you ask "Who created God?"  then you have to ask "Who created God's creator?" and "Who created THAT one's creator?"  ad infinitum, ad nauseam.<br>  <br>  Saying that God has always been is NOT "infinite regression", rather to ask of God's creator, THAT fulfills and satisfies the definition of "infinite regression."<br>  <br>  Ok.  If you honestly want an answer, and you're not just mocking things you don't know anything about, read on.  If not, then quit asking questions for which you want no answer!<br>  <br>  Ok.  Here goes, ONE  MORE  TIME!<br>  <br>  For God to even be qualified to BE God, He must have created this MEST universe (MEST = Matter, Energy, Space and Time).<br>  <br>  If God created this MEST universe, He can not be part of the very universe He created, nor can He consist of the materials which He created to form this MEST universe.<br>  <br>  This means, first, that God can not consist of matter or energy.  Jesus said, "God is Spirit."<br>  <br>  Second, God can not exist within the framework of the space/time continuum that He, Himself created.  This means that God transcends both space AND time.  In other words, God is infinite in scope, and eternal in duration.  If He isn't, then He isn't God.<br>  <br>  But understand, that since God is neither a part of, nor consist of, MEST, one can not use the tools of MEST (physics, etc) to discover or measure God.<br>  <br>  God told us how we can find Him.  He said, "If you seek for me, then you shall find me, if you search for me with all of your heart (with an honest and humble heart), and I WILL be found of you, says the Lord."<br>  <br>  Jesus also said that if you REALLY want to know if God gave him his message (implying the existence of said God), then "OBEY  THESE  COMMANDS, and you shall know!"  I believe He was referring to the Sermon on the Mount, starting in the 5th chapter of the gospel according to Matthew.<br>  <br>  Of course, that is only if you REALLY want to know.  Otherwise, you're just another of a million hypocrites who CLAIM they want to know, but they don't REALLY want answers.  (I HOPE this is NOT the case for YOU.)<br>  <br>  But if it IS, then also remember that Jesus said that the ONLY reason people reject Him is "because their deeds are evil, and they love darkness and hate the light!"  (HEY!  Jesus said it, not me!)<br>  <br>  God said that He would reveal Himself to the humble, but that He would hide Himself from the proud, the arrogant, the skeptic, the scoffer, and the mocker alike.<br>  <br>  So, with all that - the one sure fire test that Jesus gave, plus the promise that God gave when He said you could find Him if you seek with an honest and humble heart, then with all that, if you STILL don't believe in God, then all I can say is that the ONLY reason you don't believe in God is because you don't WANT to believe in God.  In that case, I guess you can join the millions of others whose theme song is "Don't confuse me with the facts; my mind's already made up!"<br>  <br>  Now, while what I had to say is a bit rough, I realize that, sometimes the truth hurts, and you need to know the truth, just as a good doctor won't hide the bad news from you, if he discovers you have cancer.  It's not pleasant, but if you know about it soon enough, you still have time to do something about it.<br>  <br>  God said that He doesn't want ANY to spend eternity in hell, but that ALL would come to Him and repent.  He said He does NOT take delight in the death of the wicked.  He even cried out, "Please choose Life, that you may live!"  (Jesus said, "I am Life!")<br>  <br>  So, with God, I am beseeching you to call out to Jesus and ask Him to reveal Himself to you; but be prepared to make some changes in your life.  He requires that we get rid of all sin (with His help, of course) (that's what "repent" means, after all.  Jesus said, "Go and sin no more.")  <br>  <br>  If you do, then God will not only forgive you and cleanse your heart (spiritually speaking), but He will set you free from your sins, and their eternal consequences, and the power they have over you.  Jesus said, "Whom the Son sets free shall be free indeed."  And then, He will adopt you into His Forever Family.|`|LjsRfaskaa	The quantum physicists are saying that energy is consciousness.

If someone is constantly struggling against your dominance, you're both just going to end up miserable.<br>  <br>  If, on the other hand, you are one of those people who while dominant in your public life, wishes to be submissive in your personal life, you might seek out a more dominant partner, and set boundaries as to where in your life you are submissive, and where in your life you are more independent and dominant.<br>  <br>  Yes there are people who are right down the middle, they're everywhere.  It simply depends on what you're looking for in a relationship who would be the best partner for you.  Good luck in your search.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	Well honestly two dominant people don't tend to mesh well.  In all relationships there is always someone more submissive and one more aggressive. <br>  <br>  I think you should look for someone that will stand up to you, but will let you be who you are as well.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	Yes you should, if not it wil cause some anger. I dont, im sorry.|`|3uRM7FKIaa	I was a bit put off when I glanced at your avatar but I take it you are a woman then?  <br>  <br>  If you are truly a dominant sort then settling for a more as you put it "balanced" guy will only end up with you  frustrated and angry. <br>  <br>  You may not need a true "sub" but more someone who is willing to let you take the reins and make the decisions. Just remember that even though he may be more sub does not mean he needs walking on and that you need to get his input too. At least in major things.<br>  <br>  But as stated before, never settle.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Never settle.  You'll be miserable.|`|LURqbzoZaa	Im sure there are submissive guys, guys who are in the middle, and guys who are dominant. I dont think you should settle though, if you are looking for a relationship. If your not, someone in between would probably be good.

RXcjh3csaa	bring a boyfriend home with you. perhaps a skinny cuban lad named Jorge.  put on some abba and proceed to scuttle the little devil. that should do the trick.  or you could just not go to your parents if you don't feel comfortable not "being gay enough" there.  Maybe just tone it down when visiting out of respect, then as soon as you leave prance to your car, crank up your gloria gaynor cd and gay it up to your hearts content.  <br>  <br>  have fun twinkle toes, don't let the bastard's grind you down.  persevere, you will get to unleash your gayness on the world before to long.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	if that's who you are, you should have no problem being yourself around your family.  <br>  <br>  you're asking for tips on how to be yourself?  i'm wondering if that's really who you are.  or are you trying to be a version of gay that you have seen somewhere else?|`|4HClQObFaa	Well, I don't know what you mean by 'acting gay'.<br>  <br>  I suspect you mean acting camp and girly and wearing make-up. Am I right?<br>  <br>  And I think that you are trying to do the wrong thing. I think you ought to be trying to get your family to see how you feel and NOT how you think gay people LOOK.<br>  <br>  You should not be trying to shock them by cross-dressing or acting girly. You should be telling them, while you are watching a televison program, which of the people attract you. THAT after all is the difference between gay people and straight people. We are attracted to people of the same sex.<br>  <br>  Let that be seen. I don't think you should be trying to shock your family by the way you ACT. You should be getting them to realise who is attractive to you.|`|9Dz7Vi43aa	If you're trying to be yourself then BE YOURSELF <br>  you dont need to learn how<br>  butttttt<br>  it wouldn't hurt to moan when you see a hot guy...... especially with your mom right next to you|`|yteRTQFAaa	I think u sould bring a guy friend or ur boyfriend over. wen he gets there hug him and kiss him. show him to ur family. wen u show him the house hold his hand.

I too thought that if I act gay people will know that I'm gay. It was so unnecessary to put on this act. I realized that although I'm gay, I still have to be myself and to respect myself. Some gay men are naturally fem or butch and that's okay but to act not like yourself is wrong. The best way for your mom to accept you is for you to be yourself not this screamer acting unlike yourself. This way while she's adjusting to all this, she hasn't totally lost her mind. I'm guessing by your "name" that you're European? Europe is so openly gay unless you live in the sticks somewhere. Why don't you just be yourself; you are gay and out and that's fine, but the sooner you realize that being yourself "a good person morally and ethically" the sooner your mom will accept this side of you. Okay? But ease up- this is not easy for her.|`|5DhtndSIaa	I suggest you don't "act."  By being who you are you will eventually gain respect from those who truly care about you and not how you reflect their unique positions.  You love your mother and, although she may not be willing to accept your sexual orientation, she should be encouraged to appreciate the aspects consistent with your beneficial role in your family.  Obviously you don't need to flaunt behavior that isn't accepted by your close associations any more than you would curse in church.  Everything has its place and time.  But at the same time, you shouldn't feel you need to display characteristics that are in conflict with who you are as a person. If you are "fem," make sure you aren't being "camp" just to get attention or experimenting to see how it flys.

Often times, the actions portrayed by characters aren't set forth as examples for us, the narrator is just saying what happened.  Similarly, what's set forth as "Law" in the Old Testament (see Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy) is often issued to keep situations from being as bad as they can be. <br>  <br>  I can imagine situations where it would be better to allow a man to keep more then one wife to prevent things from being as bad as they can be.  The ideal, of course, is one man and one woman.  But sometimes, other situations need to be legally accommodated.  <br>  <br>  I realize you're just being funny with this post ;)  It's quite clever.

5DhtndSIaa	Your inability to accumulate wealth has nothing to do with your sexual preferences any more than learning to write had to do with it.  I totally understand your feeling of frustration, but keep the following in mind:<br>  <br>  A.  We are in a "buyer" market when it comes to employment.  The glut of labor way out ways the demand.  As a result, you will have to maybe take a job below your educational aspirations.<br>  <br>  B.  Be passionate about what you want to do and your enthusiasm will go a long way to getting you where you want to be.<br>  <br>  C.  It is estimated the jobs in most demand by the end of 2015 haven't even been invented yet.  Seek a career path that matches your experience and interests.  Don't try and go backwards.<br>  <br>  D.  Examine your liabilities.  Be honest on what it is that prevented you from reaching your goals over the past 10 years.  It's difficult to access your own shortcomings, so ask previous co-workers as well as friends and relatives how they view you.<br>  <br>  E.  Focus...don't be a concerned about now as about your goals.  "Keep your eyes on the prize" and don't let other short term activities or passing interests distract your from your long term vision.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3FFb4pENaa	dude if i had a ten dollar an hour job I would consider myself wealthy... but yeah people with no skills can become wealthy... look at bam, steve o and the bunch. not to mention paris hilton etc.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Yes, but I'm not going to recommend a method.  <br>  <br>  If you lived in our very gay friendly city (Portland, Maine) that would allow you to live comfortably.  <br>  <br>  Something I lived by and did well by:  Do what you love, the money will come.<br>  <br>  Even in really bad times.

AA11142539	religious fasting is supposed to be about purifying the body... it's supposed to make you more aware spiritually.  Many religions have it as part of their faith, but as a skeptic I believe it's more the power of suggestion based off the pervasive sentiment that if it makes you feel awful, it must be good for you in some way.|`|wWL934E8aa	Isaiah 58: 6-7 tells us why we should fast and 8-14 tell you the rewards of fasting.<br>  (verses 1-5 tell of the fast they did but not according to the way God wanted.)<br>  <br>  Fast first for yourself, to set yourself free from wickedness, then fast in order to pray for others.|`|AuCnM6Qoaa	Ash Wednesday marks the onset of the Lent, the 40-day period of fasting and abstinence. It is also known as the 'Day of Ashes'. So called because on that day at church the faithful have their foreheads marked with ashes in the shape of a cross.<br>  <br>  The name 'Day of Ashes' comes from "Dies Cinerum" in the Roman Missal and is found in the earliest existing copies of the Gregorian Sacramentary. The concept originated by the Roman Catholics somewhere in the 6th century. Though the exact origin of the day is not clear, the custom of marking the head with ashes on this Day is said to have originated during the papacy of Gregory the Great (590-604).<br>  <br>  In the Old Testament ashes were found to have used for two purposes: as a sign of humility<br>  and mortality; and as a sign of sorrow and repentance for sin. The Christian connotation for ashes in the liturgy of Ash Wednesday has also been taken from this Old Testament biblical custom./<br>  Receiving ashes on the head as a reminder of mortality and a sign of sorrow for sin was a practice of the Anglo-Saxon church in the 10th century. It was made universal throughout the Western church at the Synod of Benevento in 1091.<br>  <br>  Originally the use of ashes to betoken penance was a matter of private devotion. Later it became part of the official rite for reconciling public penitents. In this context, ashes on the penitent served as a motive for fellow Christians to pray for the returning sinner and to feel sympathy for him. Still later, the use of ashes passed into its present rite of beginning the penitential season of Lent on Ash Wednesday.<br>  <br>  There can be no doubt that the custom of distributing the ashes to all the faithful arose from a devotional imitation of the practice observed in the case of public penitents. But this devotional usage, the reception of a sacramental which is full of the symbolism of penance (cf. the cor contritum quasi cinis of the "Dies Irae") is of earlier date than was formerly supposed. It is mentioned as of general observance for both clerics and faithful in the Synod of Beneventum, 1091 (Mansi, XX, 739), but nearly a hundred years earlier than this the Anglo-Saxon homilist ?lfric assumes that it applies to all classes of men.<br>  <br>  Putting a 'cross' mark on the forehead was in imitation of the spiritual mark or seal that is put on a Christian in baptism. This is when the newly born Christian is delivered from slavery to sin and the devil, and made a slave of righteousness and Christ (Rom. 6:3-18).<br>  <br>  This can also be held as an adoption of the way 'righteousness' are described in the book of Revelation, where we come to know about the servants of God.The reference to the sealing of the servants of God for their protection in Revelation is an allusion to a parallel passage in Ezekiel, where Ezekiel also sees a sealing of the servants of God for their protection:<br>  <br>  "And the LORD said to him [one of the four cherubim], 'Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark [literally, "a tav"] upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.' And to the others he said in my hearing, 'Pass through the city after him, and smite; your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity; slay old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary.' So they began with the elders who were before the house." (Ezekiel 9:4-6)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, like most modern translations, the one quoted above (the Revised Standard Version, which we have been quoting thus far), is not sufficiently literal. What it actually says is to place a tav on the foreheads of the righteous inhabitants of Jerusalem. Tav is one of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and in ancient script it looked like the Greek letter chi, which happens to be two crossed lines (like an "x") and which happens to be the first letter in the word "Christ" in Greek Christos). The Jewish rabbis commented on the connection between tav and chi and this is undoubtedly the mark Revelation has in mind when the servants of God are sealed in it.<br>  <br>  The early Church Fathers seized on this tav-chi-cross-christos connection and expounded it in their homilies, seeing in Ezekiel a prophetic foreshadowing of the sealing of Christians as servants of Christ. It is also part of the background to the Catholic practice of making the sign of the cross, which in the early centuries (as can be documented from the second century on) was practiced by using one's thumb to furrow one's brow with a small sign of the cross, like Catholics do today at the reading of the Gospel during Mass.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Jesus said in the curing of the demoniac boy after the transfiguration " this can only be cast out by prayer and fasting"<br>  because pray and fasting are a good personal discipline<br>  because fasting intensifies the praying<br>  <br>  Fasting can be giving up something for God's sake like smoking or spending on frivolities or abstaining from meat or alcohol or sweets or fatty foods for a period.<br>  <br>  It can aslo be giving to the needy the money that one would have spent on what is fasted from|`|p6wwiQG3aa	The purpose of fasting and prayer is to shut down the flesh, to hear from God and strengthen faith.

And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds.18 At the end of the time set by the king to bring them in, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 19 The king talked with them, and he found none equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah; so they entered the king's service. 20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom. 21 And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.|`|xxijbx4Waa	hello,<br>  there are several things to consider in fasting.and there are several reasons for fasting.<br>  to draw closer to god in prayer and fasting,may be the most prominent.<br>  have a look at this site.i found it helpful in understanding some of the aspects of this important part of our cultivation,and walk in the lord.<br>  <a href="http://www.new-life.net/fasting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.new-life.net/fasting.htm</a><br>  hope this helps ya!<br>  blessings!|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,<br>  <br>  To fast, is dying to self.

Kissing/cuddling, its all the same whether you are straight or gay.  Sex, on the other hand, is a bit different.  Basic lesbian sex involves mostly oral stimulation and using the fingers.  For the more adventurous you could try using dildoes, vibrators, strap-ons, or anything your imagination comes up with that feels good to you or your partner.

If you just wanted to get laid or "hook up" I would say to go to a club(gay club). You want a real relationship, a real friendship. You have to come by those naturally, like everyone else. That means you run into someone at a coffee shop and just hit it off or you meet someone on the subway. It would help  to be involved more in the "gay community". That means subscribing to your local gay mags, finding out where the local scene is, taking some open friends, and hitting a martini monday or whatever gay bar/restaurant has to offer. Try going online and finding a local gay website or chat room. Google these things. My best friend is gay and lives just outside of Boston  in Wakefield. He assures me that Boston has a huge gay scene. So act natural, get out there, just enjoy the gay scene, and let it fall in your lap.

Give them to the Levites who are in charge of the LORD's Tent."<br>  <br>  31:31   Moses and Eleazar did what the LORD commanded.<br>  <br>  31:32-35   The following is a list of what was captured by the soldiers, in addition to what they kept for themselves: 675,000 sheep and goats, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 virgins.<br>  <br>  31:36-40   The half share of the soldiers was 337,500 sheep and goats, of which 675 were the tax for the LORD; 36,000 cattle for the soldiers, of which 72 were the tax for the LORD; 30,500 donkeys for the soldiers, of which 61 were the tax for the LORD; and 16,000 virgins for the soldiers, of which 32 were the tax for the LORD.<br>  <br>  31:41   So Moses gave Eleazar the tax as a special contribution to the LORD, as the LORD had commanded.<br>  <br>  31:42-46   The share of the community was the same as that for the soldiers: 337,500 sheep and goats, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 virgins.<br>  <br>  31:47   From this share Moses took one out of every fifty prisoners and animals, and as the LORD had commanded, gave them to the Levites who were in charge of the LORD's Tent.<br>  <br>  31:48   Then the officers who had commanded the army went to Moses<br>  <br>  31:49   and reported, "Sir, we have counted the soldiers under our command and not one of them is missing.<br>  <br>  31:50   So we are bringing the gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces that each of us has taken. We offer them to the LORD as a payment for our lives, so that he will protect us."<br>  <br>  31:51   Moses and Eleazar received the gold, all of which was in the form of ornaments.<br>  <br>  31:52   The total contribution of the officers weighed over four hundred pounds.<br>  <br>  31:53   Those who were not officers kept the loot they had taken.<br>  <br>  31:54   So Moses and Eleazar took the gold to the Tent, so that the LORD would protect the people of Israel.<br>  <br>  -----------------------------------<br>  <br>  Question: What did God do with hundreds of captive virgin prisoners, gold and chattels in His tent?<br>  <br>  Moses creates this God for his wicked purposes. This is the God of the Old and New Testament, the God of Jesus and Jews. This God did a lot of sharing as you see. Our leaders learn from this God. That is the problem.

The maid called the police after getting attacked. They arrested the Princess. She of course was later released swiftly on bond and the case was dropped because the lawyer's defense to the judge was that she didn't really understand she was breaking the law as she was allowed to beat her slaves at home. The judge ruled in her favor end of story. I am not good at finding links but it happened about several years ago. She was in the Uni at Orlando. Was this girl evil? What she did was.

Any evidence for them being in between? Going to mosque and calling yourself a Muslim is not evidence of being even half-Muslim. Please read Qur'an, slowly, and take in its messages.<br>  <br>  But like all other Muslims, untrue, half, or otherwise still in development to true Muslim, they can repent any time they want (except when death is imminent, Pharoah, didn't work), and of course if they wait, they will get a chance under Mahdi.

If by ghetto you mean having a million kids and being violent then no.

And since he's a coworker, you're not expected to be so formal with him.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Yeah, I know what you mean...it's silly that people feel that respect makes them feel old.<br>  <br>  My nephews find it amazing that growing up, I didn't know the first names of my friends' parents. This is because to me, they were "Mr Lopez" or "Mrs. Miller", etc., not "Pedro" or "Marie".  It was just how I was raised.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	As an older person, I can say that it depends on how the term "sir" or "ma'am" is used as to whether it makes ME feel old. I can't speak for others, but if a person knows my name and still calls me ma'am instead of my name, I tend to get a little annoyed. I don't mind the "yes ma'am" or "no ma'am" thing at all and think it shows you were raised right and are respectful, but if I were a co-worker and you called me "ma'am" instead of "Jane" in ordinary conversation, I would probably say about the same thing to you that your co-worker said. At some point you became an adult in the eyes of the older generation and while they still appreciate your respect of their age, I think they would also like to be your friend and you normally call your friends by their first names.|`|n7qcfWxkaa	Sometimes you can't win. I would rather be called Ma'am than "lady" or "miss" or "hey you" by some punk kid. I like a little respect given to me, and I like to give it to older people unless I know them really well as friends.<br>  <br>  How else would you address someone you don't know? I like "ma'am" and "sir" and wish they would make a comeback.|`|7edl5u1oaa	I definitely relate to you! I have been raised to do the same and now it comes natural. I even do it to people that are not even that much older to me. I can't help with trying to stop because i find it hard to stop too,  lol!<br>  <br>  You know it's funny b/c in the older days someone that age would consider it disrespect when you didn't address no maam or yes sir but now some don't like it. Funny but i can't help it!|`|AaXl3vcCaa	because now children are not raised to call adults that out of respect and it has turned into a term that is mainly used for older people. he just does not want to feel like you think he is old<br>  <br>  i grew up in a small town and call them sir or mam unless they ask me not to like he did, it is common for them not to like it and then i just try to remember to call them by name|`|7YTiooX5aa	I was raised the same way and now I am a ma'am and I tell people all the time "please don't call me ma'am, I work for a living." I know it is out of respect but hell I'm only 38 yrs old I'm not old enough to be a ma'am yet......or am I?|`|vd2ExGEraa	i guess it depends on the person, some people like the respect. But the main reason they act like that they don't like to be reminded of their "old" age. i know silly right. when i'm older i want to be respected!|`|ON84EQaBaa	It's a respect thing, I'm 58 yrs. old and I still use ma'am & sir  mister & mrs.to those older than me. or( look older).|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	Because it makes them sound ancient.|`|SAMRKyZsaa	I can only speak for myself but it does make me feel old. I am not even old not even 30 yet but  i used to do a lot of work with kids and they would call me sir.  I was flattered and impressed because i did not think to many kids learned about respect these days. At the same time i hated it.  It made me feel so old when in my mind i am not <br>  <br>  I say keep doing it to new people you meet until they correct you.  Then you call them as they want to.  I have a coworker older than my mother and i call her by her first name because that is what she wants she does not want and formal title.l|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	I'm 80 and appreciate the respect in calling me ma'am.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	They better!! Its called respect!
2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	I'll have to say neigh.    Most designers don't want to be saddled with that... Models would be cropping up at fashion shows wanting to wear mules with them, leading to breeches of contract.    I think stirrup pants have already seen their hayday.|`|VUHiCEMyaa	Yes, history always repeats itself.|`|pbDLvO9Jaa	I don't want to saddle you down with details but in every life a little rein must fall. Just take the bit in the mouth and go with it. Don't dilly dally or you will just be stallion for time and that would be your worst night mare. If you need change in your life try a quarter horse.|`|YMnTveWuaa	If they could make a buck off it. It could be a short ride to riches. You just have to pony up the cash before you can reign in the riches.|`|NO7yEh8caa	Oh Lord I hope so. Lemme tell you, it is no small chore getting my two critters leashed up and ready for a walk. And, just to make life more difficult, I have to use my hands to hold them. Now....if...if....stirrup pants were to become yet again a modern fashion statement, being fashionable is very important to me, I could buckle the critters to each leg at the ankle and not only free up my hands for more important  things like....oh...holding a couple of beers, but with a good set of skates, have them tow me into town.|`|AA10025824	Don't stirrup the past, remember plaid polyester?|`|4PQOiSfZaa	It could.

1wNsBNmxaa	he either does not know who you are...are he does not want any thing to do with you maybe it is you that annoys him in that is why he does not want to talk to you maybe you did something to him not the other way around you can not play the blame game in point fingers at people      D?mon~~?|`|1vCoaf08aa	Sorry    FAIL|`|KDHmaaQyaa	If you are talking online...it's most likely nothing you did wrong. Guys sometimes suck at online communication. Try not to stress about it too much, and try for as much face-to-face communication as possible, it's better and easier to read the other person. Hope that helps!

dFBccLExaa	I believe in spirit guides, animal totems, angels, whatever you want to call them. I believe that spirits from the other side help the living for a variety of reasons, and I think everyone has contact with a guide at least once during their life (if not throughout the entirity of their life). I think these guides can manifest through many means- dreams, visions, thoughts, ideas, etc. But you have to have something to do once you've left the realm of the living, so why not help out those who are here.<br>  <br>  Edit: And I guess I should add, that except for the Christian faith, spirit guides aren't demonic. I've never met any pagan who feels that any spirit guide/entity to be a demon.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	As a Christian I believe in only the holy spirit as my guide. I believe Angels are messengers of God.<br>  And I believe those claiming to be "spirit guides" are really Demons trying to trick people.<br>  I heard a man speak who was a former medium. He later became a Christian and let me tell you his "spirit guide" was mad as Hell and tormented him.<br>  <br>  ?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes the Holy spirit and ministers...|`|Z6TNsJluaa	Spirit guides are demons in disguise within the spiritual realm. There is no such things as spirit guides.. I have read a lot on this subject and new a lady would was caught up into this occult even though she had somewhat of a christian upbringing. She started getting strange foreknowledge of things and she started going Trans-mental classes which cause her to get inside herself and there she would met up with a spirit that would be her guide. She had two that she named one, Jesus.. But I won't go into anymore details but her book is called, "A beautiful side of evil"  She was in this coarse involved with drugs which enhanced her spiritual influence, and she didn't know that the spirit guides over times got more evil and violent in their behavior toward her.. She came out of it and was set free from not spirit guides but rather demons who disguised themselves as angels of light..If you are thinking of going this route, Beware, for some are able to break free but only after giving their life and mind to Christ and others, never do..|`|8OeulLkmaa	I believe we have guardian angels.  I am a christian so I believe what the bible says: the children of God are led by the Spirit of God.  The bible also states that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost: greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world.  I believe, in other words, to listen to our hearts...not some outside force.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	God does not like us messing with the spirit world. There are many places in the Bible that tell us not to do it. God wants us to talk to him.|`|dn00Yw3taa	I believe in angels and demons...the Bible says nothing of "spirit" guides.  I can tell you this, I dabbled in that stuff and discovered for myself that these "spirit guides" that people are talking about is nothing more than demonic deception.  I would advise you to steer clear from it, as the voice of experience.  You can believe me or not, but those "spirit guides" are demon spirits.  Seek God and the Bible, His word as your guide.  :)|`|K07MXHjRaa	i dont believe in spirit guides . i believe i am protected by GOD, The Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ and Angels. and these are what protect everyone who recieves them and even if they dont recieve them they are protected.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	The bible tells us that God sends His angels to protect us. The Holy Spirit is our guide and comforter. All other spirits are evil spirits. Satan's little helpers you could call them. Avoid them like the plague.|`|b4249c9c6f429c6d0170ca6a7e744bf3aa	Since we live in the spirit world you can imagine that we are directed in many ways.|`|kDECE7ETaa	our Holy book guide us every thing"Holy Quran"|`|N6cCc9dOaa	We have angels.They are spirits and they guide us.

KiN3KVihaa	yes, it would be like saying "what is it?" "whaddya want?"  Not always rude though if used with close friends.  Might also be expressing frustration (for example, if someone had asked them many times to do something and was about to ask them another question).  Obviously, a lot depends on tone.<br>  <br>  <br>  -EDIT-<br>  Maybe a better translation would be "What is this?!?!" ("this"--as in the situation.  "nani" means "what" in Japanese, but you probably already know this).  One of those expressions that doesn't translate the best to english.  you can probably get all of the meaning out of it just by looking at the facial expression and tone in this case.|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	I'd think "what is it, now?", but I'm not native.

4yzxXO1haa	I tend to wear mostly black just because I don't want to upset anyone else at the funeral, and as a sign of respect to the deceased's family (unless they've indicated to do otherwise). However, everyone at my funeral needs to wear fluoro and glow sticks, and get royally drunk afterwards.  =]|`|GWcFdxngaa	I think it shows a lot of respect to wear black, but maybe if you wore a colour which symbolises that person. example - if their favourite colour was red, maybe wear a small amount or red.    But, you shouldn't go over the top, and forget why you are at the funeral.    Hope that helped :)|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I don't think it really matters what you wear to a funeral as long as it's clean and modest. I've been to many funerals the last few years where people left work at factories or similar jobs to attend. I don't see anything wrong with that at all. It's the thought that counts and the focus of the funeral should be the deceased and family members. It shouldn't be viewed as a fashion show.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	Wise person never play leapfrog with unicorn.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Wear what you think the person would have liked. I went to my grandfathers funeral last weekend and wore purple and black. He was a pretty laid back guy so I knew he wouldn't mind. And my 1st wedding dress was black. Which was quite suitable seeing as the marriage was dead after a few months. :-)|`|AA12317147	Black is not the only color to wear at funeral. It is just a mark of respect - and you show the support for their near and dear ones that you grieve with them.    Stay away from bright colors. Some subdued colors like brown or dark blue should do it too.    Red, pure white and purple are colors to avoid. They can show happiness and that's not the intent.|`|QWaspeg7aa	I think as long as what you wear is kind of smart and respectable then you don't need to wear black, or if the person wasn't a smart type of person themselves then just wear anything tidy, maybe that you know that person would like. I definitely don't want people in black at mine, unless they like black and want to wear it. I suppose it depends as well on what you know about that person- do you know what their opinions were on traditions like that? Something else to consider though is maybe what the other people going think- if they were closer to the person than you and they're traditional themselves then there is the potential for causing offense- they might consider that you are being disrepectful, so I'd say you don't definitely have to wear black but I think you should be smart (unless the person just wasn't like that). It's a difficult one though, I agree with you for asking.|`|lxeGKjLbaa	I think any color is fine as long as is isn't too bright... but really, if it's the deceased's favorite color and you think that's appropriate then wear it and if anyone else thinks it's rude, who cares?|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I don't think it would be tacky at all to wear a colour that meant something to the deceased.  In fact, it's a really nice idea.  I never, ever wear black to a funeral (I save black for weddings) - I agree that the occasion should be about the life of that person, not their death.  It's a sad enough time without everyone making it more depressing by wearing black.  Really, it's on old fashioned and outdated idea.  Celebrate who they were and the life they had, don't dwell on their death.  Colour is a touching way to honour that life.|`|I8b66BvSaa	Maybe if you don't wear black, suggest the other people do the same? Afterall, you have to wear black for EVERY occasion, weddings, formal occasions etc. why not celebrate the persons life rather than mourn their death, not wearing black is a great idea to celebrate someone's life, especially in their favourite colour.    Basically it would be a good idea to consult the close family first just incase they got offended, and a better idea if you could persuade everyone to do the same as you!  Hope this helps. Sorry about the long answer!|`|4Td1aRWSaa	I think white would work well.|`|52VDjbNTaa	I know someone that went to a funeral of a child, where everyone wore something yellow, because it was his favourite colour.  I think it's good when everyone doesn't just wear black.  I personally would hate to think people were fussing over what to wear at my funeral.  Don't turn up in bright pink if everyone else is wearing black, but perhaps suggest to the funeral organisers it would be nice to wear the deceased's favourite colour? It brings a celebration of their life to the day, not just a comiseration about their death. It shows there's thought, & that you care.  However, clown outfits, jeans, scruffy clothes are not acceptable. You have to pay a little respect.  Also, don't dress down too much, you don't want to offend anyone.  In summary, just play the field, see what everyone else is doing, & concentrate on who died & remembering them. That's what the whole service is about, after all.|`|Mumfvpuzaa	it is not neccessary to wear black, but it is a somber time and muted colors are appropriate.  browns, navys, purples, etc.  you could wear black slacks or skirt and a red shirt.  i've done it and it's fine.  other times if i go to a viewing or funeral from work, i wear my work clothes|`|YH8ERZg8aa	if a person is thinking about it too much, then, to me, it sounds like they're trying too hard to be different....i say, just do it...it's one of those customs that is so easy to follow. it's really not up to the individual to decide.
iHDYncuXaa	How long have you been rejecting your creator??|`|EAuMJrs4aa	atheists how long have you been fighting god and winning?    anyone here know how to build and anti mormon fence?|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	You know I've seen your answers for a long time now and you're really pretty mean and arrogant.  Don't you think it's a least possible that there might be something out there that is beyond your understanding.  I mean, the arrogance of saying that you understand 13 billion years (in your mind) of the universe so well that no other explanation is possible but yours, is just staggering.  You are finite and limited and no matter what turns out to be "the truth", you will one day admit that you knew a very small fraction of it.  You and science really can't explain every detail of the simplest cell that science knows anything about.  It's workings are an absolute miracle.      Back off a little.  Your not changing anyone's mind and your only working up your hatred for no reason.  Just stay out of R & S and lower you blood pressure if you don't like Christians that much.|`|v1dnnMQuaa	I haven't, but if you're suggesting that every atheist has a B.S. in Biology, I would beg to differ, I'd bet most of them don't.|`|SWfaNKSgaa	Not all Christians reject evolution|`|YyEEAJBkaa	I havent studied biology formally since I was about 13, luckily that is the age you learn about fundamentals of life such as evolution.  Every idiot at least, accepts evolution,  People who don't are just too stupid for their opinions to even matter.|`|jRcdbna5aa	While I wouldn't expect every Creationist to have major training in biology, it would be nice if they had some familiarity with the topic before rejecting it out of hand.|`|hPQurfluaa	Atheist, how long you been fighting God and losing?|`|b2bMy1EAaa	GodWinsInTheEnd? Losing? Only in America is religion and Christianity still strong. All the rest of the western world is giving up on it.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	It's always intrigued me how you can work with biology at all if you don't believe that species evolve over time. Without evolution you can't comprehend biology so how you can have creationist biologists is a mystery to me.|`|tW86bOMNaa	Aw! Why limit it just to biology?    Astronomy - size of the universe and its age;  Astrophysics - creation of elements, specifically carbon;  Chemistry - specifically organic chemistry;  Physics - radiation, crystallography;  Mathematics - combinatorics, complexity, chaos theory;  Botany - observation of extant species;  Geology - rock formation, fossilisation processes.    When you start to think about it, there's a *lot* they need to refute before they can even begin!|`|70QwHRDPaa	Many Creationist that 'were' former believers of evolution are Biologist, as For the Greek Mythical god's ?   How can you fight a nonexistent ?|`|vWbbNd6Baa	Aw Tao, I think you made Nick cry.|`|AA11521494	Quite.  They obviously are rejecting most of what biology has to tell us.    Isn't Nick just the most wonderful, loving Christian?  Rather like his god who commanded the Israelites to commit genocide...|`|n5Fkuxz5aa	Since 2001    Edit: My own experiences have compelled me to believe in a higher power, science is silent on the matter. I was not raised to believe in God, my parents were scientists and I would call them agnostic. There is nothing in science that I have learned that disproves the existence of God or of the supernatural. Darwinian Evolution, does not address the issue at all. Scientifically, I believe the correct position for a scientist to hold is one of agnosticism because science neither proves or disproves the supernatural, my own personal experiences push me into the believer category. I am open to the idea that a scientist could have a personal experience that pushes him or her into the nonbeliever category, only I have not yet been able to think up a satisfactory scenario for that.

It's just a normal thing ;)<br>  <br>  Also, I read the conversation you had with your friend. Well... how can you say she's not bi ? I mean, most bisexuals have a preference.

You don't have to make something fancy, his favourite will always earn you more brownie points than some really fancy complicated recipe.    Have a great valentines day!|`|wLLzL8Traa	If you have a picture of you both together you could frame it and give him that. you could make him some valentine cookies or a valentine cake, you could make a scrap book with things you both have done you know good old memories.  my bf loves peanut butter cookies so I made these cause they are easy:  1 cup crunchy peanut butter, 1 cup sugar, and 1 extra large egg.  mix ingredients together then scoop up about a tablespoon of dough and roll into balls and put on a ungreased cookie sheet.  press balls down with a fork.  preheat oven to 350 and bake until edges are brown.  3 to 10 min. ovens vary so check  often.  quick easy and delicious.this recipe was on some tv program.Happy Valentines Day to you and yours|`|03z6P220aa	a nice date with beutefull drass with a Specal KIS|`|BRnYseFKaa	collage of photos of the both of you in a photo frame.....    get a bracelet or something and get it engraved??    a photo album or diary or something with just things about the two of you.....    or maybe give him a box (love heart or something) with all your favourite things and best memories inside.

LlurBCwnaa	EXACTLY!  Thank you for this question!      For all you out there who CLAIM THAT SUNDAY MUST BE KEPT HOLY and yet who BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS OUR SABBATH REST, read SABBATH DAY FREEDOM'S question again.    You contradict yourselves!  If you truly believe that Jesus is our Sabbath, then why do you insist on observing the Sunday???  How can you claim that it's wrong to shop or do common labor on Sunday when Romans 4:15 says where there is no law, there is no transgression.|`|18a5d7e369330da3a47ede67c6e1e096aa	According to the Catholic Church, the Sabbath begins on Saturday evening. This is why many churches offer Saturday evening mass as well as traditional Sunday masses.    Although in Jewish culture the Sabbath is recognized as Saturday, Christians worship on Sundays. This is because this is the day Jesus was resurrected. Many contest that the Sabbath should actually be Saturday, but the ancient text the Didache discovered in the late 1800 describes the earliest Christians observing the Jewish sabbath as law required and then rising early Sunday morning (the beginning of the Jewish work week) to meet and have communion with one another (an early form of Catholic mass) BEFORE they went to officially start work.    So, to answer your question in one way, the earliest Christians worshiped (kept the Sabbath holy) by having communion until they were out from under Jewish law at the time. As Jesus performed miracles and his disciples plucked grain on the Sabbath, I believe the importance for Christians is to place the Lord first on the Sabbath. In Jesuss image, it is not wrong to do necessary or good work on the Sabbath, but place God first.    I hope this helps you find the answer you were looking for!|`|hj76FSKdaa	Well, Jesus is Lord over the Sabbath.   But I'm not sure what your point is.  Let's consider the Sabbath issue.    In Exodus 20: 8-10, we find the requirement for observing Saturday as the Sabbath. However, the specific instructions (from which Jews and Seventh Day Adventist observe this day) are found elsewhere in the Old Testament. SDAs observe the Sabbath from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday. They abstain from secular work, food preparation, secular forms of recreation, and watching non-religious programs on television.     But why dont they follow the whole law? In other words, why do those who insist on keeping the Sabbath do so by removing certain parts of a fixed covenant treaty and applying them as they wish? Here are just a few (additional) regulations for the Sabbath:    Do not travel: Exodus 16:28  Do not use a wood stove or furnace on the Sabbath: Exodus 35: 3  Every Sabbath, remember that you were slaves in Egypt: Deuteronomy 5:15  Impose the death penalty for violating the Sabbath: Exodus 31:15    Paul warned against those in the early churchcalled Judaizerswho sought to impose Sabbath regulations upon Christians of that day. In Acts 15, the early church met to discuss what parts of the Jewish traditions were applicable to the gentile believers. If Sabbath keeping was essential it would have been mentioned in the discussion because it would have been an unfamiliar practice to the Gentiles.    After Jesus' resurrection whenever He met with His disciples and the day is identified, it is NOT the Sabbath, it is the first day of the week (Sunday). Every mention of the Sabbath in the book of Acts (without a single exception) is in connection with Jewish worship on that day and not Christian celebration. The early church met together on Sunday, as others have shown.    PS: Many large protestant churches have multiple worship services, including a Saturday service.  My church also has a Wednesday night service.  God doesnt care what day we worship on, as long as we do not forsake corporate worship.  But the Bible does warn against judging others who observe a day other than the one you prefer.|`|AA10471892	Why do you continually use Sunday as a straw-man argument?  Sunday is irrelevant.  Whether one worships on a Sunday, or a Monday, or any other day of the week does not mean it is being used as a day of "rest" like the o.c. sabbath.    Christ is our "sabbath" and the true "rest" if found in Him. Without Him, you labor in vain, for in the end, you die anyway.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	That's just the ones that sees the Sabbath and some of the old testament as not necessary anymore.. I'm a 7th day adventist and we still keep the Sabbath day holy..|`|SWfaNKSgaa	Because we feel like it.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Um, how do we know which day is actually the Sabbath? Are we absolutely sure everyone has been faithfully counting to seven over and over again since the time of Adam?    I think the point is that every seventh day should be a day of rest. It does not particularly matter which day is number seven. I mean you could change it to a Friday if you liked, it would still a day of rest every seventh day.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	Sunday Laws                     Satan's Challenge to God's Authority          God denounces Babylon "because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.".     God made the world in six days and rested on the seventh, sanctifying this day, and setting it apart from all others as holy to Himself, to be observed by His people throughout their generations. But the man of sin, exalting himself above God, sitting in the temple of God, and showing himself to be God, thought to change times and laws. This power, thinking to prove that it was not only equal to God, but above God, changed the rest day, placing the first day of the week where the seventh should be. And the Protestant world has taken this child of the papacy to be regarded as sacred. In the Word of God this is called her fornication [Rev. 14:8].  ______________________________________...       Sunday-Law Advocates                             Do Not Realize What They Are Doing            The Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending.    They are working in blindness. They do not see that if a Protestant government sacrifices the principles that have made them a free, independent nation, and through legislation brings into the Constitution principles that will propagate papal falsehood and papal delusion, they are plunging into the Roman horrors of the Dark Ages.    There are many, even of those engaged in this movement for Sunday enforcement, who are blinded to the results which will follow this action. They do not see that they are striking directly against religious liberty. There are many who have never understood the claims of the Bible Sabbath and the false foundation upon which the Sunday institution rests.      Those who are making an effort to change the Constitution and secure a law enforcing Sunday observance little realize what will be the result. A crisis is just upon us.

Be it positive or negative. Sometimes even the most positive comment turns into negative depending on the listener. If i don't like you, anything anyone says about you i would take it as negative even if it is good. So when you are about to say something about anyone decide does the listener like or dislike this person, is the listener the kind of person who will pass this information on and than u have to think would they pass it the way it is or in a different context. Backbiting starts with talking about others behind their back and it explodes into a huge mess when the listener passes it on in a negative way. So be care when u are talking. Its best to say anything about anyone to them or in front of them. E.g if someone borrows money from you and doesn't return on time, don't tell the whole world how they didn't follow through, rather talk to them. By telling everyone you are backbiting and also hurt that person and their reputation.|`|6SlBdQZ8aa	Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do you know what is backbiting? They (the Companions) said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Backbiting implies your talking about your brother in a manner which he does not like. It was said to him: What is your opinion about this that if I actually find (that failing) in my brother which I made a mention of? He said: If (that failing) is actually found (in him) what you assert, you in fact have backbitten him, and if that is not in him it is a slander. [Sahih Muslim Book 32, #6265]|`|OvYNWnQ0aa	Backbiting means gossiping about someone behind their back. Spreading their personal info, or spreading opinions about them, islam teaches that this is extreeeemely bad. <br>  The prophet compared backbiting to eating the flesh of your brother, often in islam, graphic descriptions are given for things so as to give people a visual represnetation to judge the weight of certain behaviors which seem innocent.  <br>  <br>  PS For this reason it should be mentioned that this is one of the greatest things todays brothers and sisters need to work on, REALLY|`|kDUBuBxnaa	The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) wanted to drive home the meaning of backbiting to his Companions through questions and answers. He asked them, 'Do you know what backbiting is?' They replied, 'Allah and His Messenger know best'. He said, 'It is saying something about your brother which he would dislike'. Someone asked, 'What if I say something about my brother which is true?' The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, 'If what you say of him is true, it is backbiting and if it is not true you have slandered him.' (Reported by Muslim, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa’i)|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	The prophet Mohammed(saw) said that backbiting is saying something about someone that they won't like behind their back.

A man may commit adultery, and drink [wine], and then repent, and Allah will forgive him.  But, the backbiter will not be forgiven by Allah until his [backbited] companion forgives him." [Suyuti, Al-Jami` as-Saghir, 1/174, #2919, from Ibn Abid-Dunya, and Abush-Shaykh, Al-Tawbikh.]<br>  <br>  It has been defined precisely by the Prophet (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) as, "Your mentioning your brother with something about him that he dislikes [being spoken about]."<br>  Someone asked, "How about if my brother contains that [characteristic which I am mentioning]?"<br>  He replied, "If he possesses that which you mention, then you have [indeed] backbited him. And, if he does not contain that which you say, then you have slandered him." [Muslim in al-Birr, 4/2001, #70; Ahmad in Al-Musnad, 2/230,384]<br>  <br>  "And, when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it." [Qur'an, 28:55]|`|fN6eDrFKaa	backbiting means speaking about a Muslim in his absence and saying things that he would not like to have spread around or mentioned. Buhtaan or slander means saying things about a Muslim that are not true, or in other words telling lies about him.

It will suffice for us to mention just a few of them in order to demonstrate that they are haraam. <br>  <br>  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  <br>  “neither backbite one another.

jcL7gDMKaa	i know what you mean, so many of my friends have had problems finding work because of this. Long hair on men is another thing that causes problems. Women can have any hairstyle they want except a skinhead but men get hassle if their hair is like longer than 5 inches or something.  Piercings on men is also unfair too, one of my exes was asked to remove his ear piercings at his job, even though he worked in the freezer/cold room in a supermarket so customers never even saw him! Also all the girls on the checkouts wore loads of jewelry, including numerous ear piercings, but nothing was said to them! He took the supermarket to court (Sainsburys) and won compensation for being unfairly discriminated against.     What gives women the right to decorate themselves and not men??

Am I the only person who is quite happy to put on the corporate image at work?! I like it because it helps me kind of get into the role.

BcbehBBlaa	..I think you put this in the wrong category? This is 'Religion & Spirituality"        where it started, according to wikipedia:    According to Terry Gould's Book The Lifestyle: A Look at the Erotic Rites of Swingers [3], swinging began among United States Army Air Force pilots and their wives during World War II. The mortality rate of pilots was high. Gould reports that a close bond arose between pilots, with the implication that husbands would care for all the wives as their own, emotionally and sexually, if the husbands were away or lost (thus bearing some similarity to levirate marriage).    This is debatable, however, since it would have been unusual for wives to accompany their husbands on foreign tours. Other sources point to U.S. Air Force pilots in the California desert as the original participants. Though the beginnings are not agreed upon, it is assumed swinging began among American military communities in the 1950s.[4] By the time the Korean War ended, swinging had spread from the military to the suburbs. The media dubbed the phenomenon wife-swapping.      Anyways-- It happens plenty, probably more nowadays because of the doors the internet opened to people who are interested in Polyamory and wife-swapping. Check around google and craigslist if you're interested, there's whole communities of it.

T1beLIQqaa	First, what ethnicity ARE you? There are not many Arabs(Semitic White) in India-(Asians of Indo European descent), or, Tanzania(Black Africans).Many Indians are Muslim. Islam is not the major religion in either-13 % in India, and, 35% in Tanzania. If you are Muslim, their rules,especially as applied to gender interaction, are much more restrictive than Western rules-as long as you re under their roof-their rules are the standard|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	Stop generalize.|`|wTqid2ONaa	As long as you're living under their roof, they are the law.  Don't like it ?  Move out, be on your own and make your own rules.
3afb1a9998ec7ae77d5dc07fa7abfe2aaa	Yes - but a minor crime.  It becomes more serious if a publication publishes it.  It is illegal to gain (money, circulation etc.) from the image of another without their permission.|`|C0yagFFoaa	they can tkae a picture of anybody they like, its if they publish it, that the law come sin, they need a reason, like the person is famous or in a scandal.|`|xRPQdKwOaa	No its not,what is illegal is if somebody hits them back.

I think he was drunk.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	I thought Islam was big on respecting elders...and 77 is pretty old.<br>  <br>  You could have said, "Sir, I'm a Muslim, and I do not believe that the crucifixion ever occurred.

We can't force religion upon anybody, we must only deliver the message|`|U5zcbHuZaa	No, I love to talk to people about religion.

It annoys me so much!!|`|SiPGcBnYaa	no<br>  <br>  thank god|`|Mwd6rQT4aa	YES!!! This woman came up to me at the library and started talking about how she found Jesus.. I was like "that's nice, good for you, but I am Muslim, and I am trying to study" and she did not get that I was trying to get rid of her, so she tried to argue with me about Jesus, and finally I had to get up and leave but she actually followed me!! I had to tell her literally "stop following me, leave me alone" and finally she backed off!! I hate that.. Seriously, I cannot stand people who try to push their religion on others..|`|CCa9kRHHaa	Customers at work are always saying stuff like "bless you."  "have a blessed day."  It gets annoying, but I just ignore it.  If you just smile and nod, they go away.  If you tell them you don't believe, they will stick around praying and trying to convert you.|`|fN6eDrFKaa	i am too far from non-muslims.<br>  the best way to handle the situation is <br>  confuse them in their matters. by asking question about their religion.<br>  he cannot answer ur questions. <br>  even the well qualified scholars like dr.willam cannot prove tiriniy !!!|`|D2YNP91waa	Nothing like that has ever happened to me but i agree with you 100% that no one should ever push a religion on someone.|`|jWUez1Bbaa	Luckily, no.<br>  <br>  loooooooooooooooool!!! =]|`|AA12264519	Christians shouldn't be doing that at all.<br>  <br>  If the guy meant to be a show-off by praying like that in front of you and your sisters, then he is just being a hypocrite.<br>  Christians should try to be humble. They don't try to push religion on you. They also should not be doing things to imply that they are more 'holier' or better than non-Christians.<br>  <br>  However, it's a good idea to get to know about different religions, just so you are aware of them and know how to deal with these sort of things without hurting others' feelings. (I don't mean that you have to believe in them. You have the freedom to choose.)<br>  <br>  Like the reason why he was calling on Jesus (via prayer) is because that's the only way to reach God (through His Son).<br>  <br>  No, nothing like this has happened to me before, but I have witnessed many ocassions where so-called "Christians" have done so.|`|zBqt99avaa	Like the crazy guy outside a mosque and screamed in my face about how I was going to burn in hell if I didn't convert to Islam that exact second?  Yeah.  I do.<br>  <br>  People are nuts.  There is a crazy guy at the corner of Yonge and Dundas (Toronto) who shouts at people about Jesus and the end of the world, etc., and then there's the nice guys who set up a dawa booth just 15-20 steps away, who give out Qurans and other materials.  i.e., there's a right way and a wrong way to teach about religion.<br>  <br>  Sorry you got hit with a crazy person.<br>  <br>  Definition of Crazy:  Anyone who thinks random people just minding their own business want to hear their views about God.|`|FhXzlnDOaa	How did he push religion on you?  Were you free to leave?  Then why did you stay?  If seems you made the choice to stay and hear what he had to say.  Oh, and he had a right to say it.  Speech is a freedom.  So is religion.<br>  <br>  This is pushing religion on someone:<br>  <br>  QURAN 009.029 <br>  YUSUFALI: Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Well you just changed your story.  At first you made it seem like some stranger just walked up to you and started praying.  Now you're saying he was discussing his faith with you, but you didn't like that he was expressing his faith.  Ok, that's like me saying let's discuss islam but don't mention Muhammad, lol.
e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  if people can marry those who have been married before........<br>  ......or converts who have had sex with their bf/gf, but converted to Islam and repented<br>  <br>  why can't they marry these kind of people?<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|U5zcbHuZaa	"If it came to it," you make it sound like this is some kind of strike against a woman. If she was the woman I am in love with that Allah chose me to marry, then there is no, "if it came to it," it is instead, "how soon can we get married, today is good for me." And if the victimization was recent, I would help her heal from the trauma by being patient, loving, and understanding of the effects of trauma (stress disorder, trust issues, depression, and maybe even intimacy issues -- in time, with love and prayer and faith, we will get through it).<br>  <br>  Edit: Other STDS might be an issue, but it is very difficult for a man to acquire HIV from heterosexual sex, there are no permeable membranes in penis, they are in vagina and anus. For oral, saliva and stomach acids kill HIV, this is why moms also don't pass it to baby in womb, digestive acids.

PnMtlZ0Yaa	Hitler was a charismatic leader. He was completely insane, but he was definitely a successful leader. People were excited by his speeches and took action. In the United States we saw the same thing in Kennedy, and again right now in Obama. The key to leadership is winning over the masses.     There is a lot of irony in your name being "God's grace is sufficient" and the question you posed.|`|rifjjQ2laa	Hitler was of the best leaders in history.    You don't need to be "good" to have leadership abilities.|`|EeOfvGo4aa	Why did Americans vote for George W. Bush? In a "democracy" there really is no excuse.....|`|AhRRhe1Yaa	People are drawn towards strength and confidence.
EmOnt7FIaa	I'm assuming you are referring to American slavery.    I believe so, people seem way more tolerant than back then. The average person is far more likely to interact with somebody of a different race now than in the 1700's. Of course you have the people who still support slavery and are still racist, but this country has definately came a long way.|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	From the time when people owned slaves?  Are you living under a rock?    You know there's this thing, called human trafficking, and those women & children are forced to be sex slaves and do involuntary servitude.  People just choose to ignore that kind of slavery.    People from Africa, Europe, Asia, etc, basically everywhere are trafficked everyday, thinking they'll be making  a better life for them and/or their family. At least African American slaves knew what was happening.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Slavery is no longer accepted as it was for thousands of years everywhere.  It apparently still is in parts of Africa.  The US was one of the first to abandon it completely.  I think only Argentina did sooner.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	we have a black president|`|69ebdfa872907c9eb5cba61e41e731b8aa	no, only the laws|`|fOSmIyaRaa	no, just the laws
0yTM98Odaa	You get racists from all ethnic backgrounds.  I don't know how it can be combated, unfortunately I think there will always be racists around.  Racist people don't care about hurting peoples feelings and harming others, I think they really need a life.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	When it comes to affecting lives racism is not defined by words or thoughts but by actions. If someone calls someone a racial epithet out of anger and ignorance the victim may have hurt feelings but in the scope of their productive lives they will still be able to achieve success.  If someone is falsely imprisoned, murdered, marginalized or anything else that would adversely affect their quality and standard of living solely because of what race they are that is racism and worthy of concern. Do the majority of Black people have the power to adversely affect other people based upon race without the fear of consequence? The answer is no. Therefore when it comes to being racist Black people by far are not racist in the since of power.      However Black people are the most divisive and destructive people to themselves. If you consider Black on Black violence as a form of racism then that would make Black people racist against themselves. So how do we stop this? As Black people we must achieve racial harmony and unity with ourselves first. Historically this has always been our greatest downfall. Even today we still find ways to divide ourselves when it suites us. Bloods and CRIPS, Muslims and Christians, East Coast and West Coast whatever you can think of are ways we divide ourselves. We never look at the one thing that we have in common. Because of that is why ourselves great kingdoms fell to foreign armies.       The Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey said that we must create a creed that Black people world wide must adhere to. We can not afford to remain divided over things that may not have anything to do with us at all. We must build strong families. Our men and women must find a way to love and respect each other. We must build eonomically viable and sustainable communities for ourselves and our children. We must create our own institutions. We must elevate our standards to lofty  heights. We must create and live by a code of morality created by us ourselves designed to specially address our standards and culture. To end racism we as Black people must become self reliant so that we can take our place in the world as a force and power to be reckoned with.       All that I have said is NOT about excluding anyone. However when there is a conflict among family it may not be a good time for company until the conflict is resolved. Meaning Black people need to be left to find our own solutions and deal with our own conflict without outside interference. As long as Black people remain dependent on someone else for there needs we will always be victims of racism.|`|4PQOiSfZaa	That's a very general question. Up north where I live, there isn't much racism except for the occasional "N" word from younger black kids. The best way to combat racism is to not tolerate it.|`|fOSmIyaRaa	I live up north,and we don't like blacks...at least  not where I live....I don't know why people say the south is more racist....anyway...there will always be racism.there is nothing you can do about it.you can't make everybody like everybody! there are tons of blacks who are racist too! not just whites!

Also, it's also not too far from Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill, which has even more. Greensboro's economy is suffering, as is everyone else's, but it's a pretty nice place. If you are coming from DC, it's going to be a culture shock. The pace is calmer, the people are nicer, and it's way cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you have never lived in a big city, DC can be fun.  I recommend that everyone try a big city at least one time in their lives.  After 11 years in DC, it was out of my system.

I will use them as packaging/cushioning if I'm posting a parcel in place of bubble wrap, and as plastic 'gloves' for cleaning the drains.

AA11946554	The problem is that these morons don't understand what is 'livinng'. They falsly believe EVERY fetus develops into a healthy, normal human so if you end it, it's murder. A miscarriage...since 'Goddidit', it's OK. <br>  I agree that murder is wrong but making a choice to let a fetus POTENTIALLY form into a human, regardless of the circumstances isn't humane. <br>  I think those involved should be able to CHOOSE what do based on what THEY know.|`|4e25e7483d2fca447ca6574ccc5af0c4aa	what about the free will of the baby..its not forcing belief, its saving life.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Christian|`|3e24a6214bf0826951332197b013d146aa	why are you trying to suppress OUR free will by saying we cant use our free will to stop their free will? <br>  you ever think of that? i dont think you did!|`|Mnm35sjNaa	I like a man who's not afraid to show his biases, MythBomber.  LoL, it makes answers so much easier.  Thou dost protesteth too much!<br>  <br>  First of all, you assume that pro-lifers are religious folks.  That's not true.  Thou dost assumeth too much.  I'm an atheist and I too believe abortion (except to save the mother's life) is immoral.<br>  <br>  "Immoral" . . . are you familiar with the word?  Morality is a code of right and wrong.  Religious people let their religions tell them what's right and wrong.  Others learn right and wrong from personal experience and reason.  The human condition is what it is -- so a lot of morals is shared everywhere . . . and a lot is not.<br>  <br>  A fundamental precept of my morality is respect for human life.  My reason tells me that the Catholic "sanctity" of human life is NOT realistic or supportable.  Sometimes killing is necessary and/or unavoidable: a just war; self defense; assassination of Osama bin Laden.  In the case of euthanasia, killing can even be humane.  There can even be persuasive justifications for the death penalty or abortion for victims of incest or rape.  To me, if killing is avoidable, it should be avoided.  That's what I mean by respect for human life (and NOT sanctity of human life).<br>  <br>  However, I do NOT support criminalizing EARLY abortions.  By "early", I mean before fetal viability.  Keep in mind that modern medicine has lowered fetal viability considerably.  Some fetuses are viable at 20 weeks and most are viable at 24 weeks.  After viability, there's no more ethical "wiggle room" left: abortion is then, absolutely, murder (by my moral code).<br>  <br>  Instead of criminalizing abortion, education and counseling should be aggressively pursued to MINIMIZE abortions and promote adoptions.  The reason for not criminalizing abortions is that they will continue whether or not they're legal.<br>  <br>  The fact is: most abortions result from NOT using contraception, despite its easy availability.  Playing fast and loose with an unwanted pregnancy is irresponsible.  If a pregnant woman's body is her responsibility, then it was also her responsibility before she got pregnant.  Not taking reasonable precautions against an unwanted pregnancy is immoral because the consequences disrespect human life.<br>  <br>  In the case of abortions performed between the 20th and 24th weeks, the fetus should be aborted WHOLE and a second doctor should be in attendance in case the fetus is viable.  If viable, the fetus should be sustained and supported as if born premature.<br>  <br>  Sound extreme?  Not to me and my moral code.  Right to life of the baby trumps quality of life for the mother (who can opt for adoption in any case).|`|etsJPie8aa	You are right on the fact that God gave us free will, and Christians<br>  should stop trying to force their belief on others.<br>  <br>  However, what I like to do is only suggesting the idea of what is<br>  going to happen.<br>  <br>  If you commit suicide you go to hell, that is what the bible says.<br>  <br>  Of course some conditions may apply ^__^ but in most case<br>  you end up in hell,, If you kill yourself to avoid a situaiton you<br>  definitely end up in hell<br>  <br>  Some people like ot know.. so I just inform them of what the scripture<br>  says on suicide.<br>  <br>  I don't force them to not die.. that would be dumb ^_^; but I like to<br>  tell them what will happen if you do,, because I feel like that is what<br>  I should do.|`|QHf2Ov6yaa	ok i'm not a christian so what you're saying about going to hell doesn't apply to my beliefs. but i believe that baby has a right to be born. i mean yeah its free will on whether or not you want to kill it, just like it's free will if you want to kill your next door neighbor. just because it's free will, doesn't make it right.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	So I should stop forcing my beliefs that murder is wrong on murderers?<br>  <br>  So I should stop forcing my beliefs that tax evasion is wrong on tax dodgers?<br>  <br>  So I should stop forcing my beliefs that child abuse is wrong on child abusers?<br>  <br>  The simple fact is -- EVERY SINGLE LAW is a violation of someone's free will to do something.

Why would anyone, for any reason, reasonably argue the right to kill an innocent person?  <br>  <br>  As for "forcing your beliefs" on someone isn't that what pro-abortionists are doing to their unborn child... and with deadly results.  <br>  <br>  The whole "I don't personally believe it" banter is ridiculous.  It is exactly like saying "I don't believe in killing someone but who am I to judge if someone else feels differently?"  Yes, exactly like that.  <br>  <br>  So stop forcing your beliefs down our throats and just keep your opinions to yourself.  <br>  <br>  Is this kinda what you are trying to say?

This is what democracy is all about. <br>  <br>  Do you have a problem with democracy?<br>  <br>  Only in anarchy can people do as they wish without regard for the rules set down by their neighbors and themselves.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|AA10311549	Why can't people argue this issue with logic, fact, and reason?<br>  <br>  1)  "Forcing a belief" is NOT necessarily what is happening.  For example is it "forcing a belief" on someone to make any law?  How about theft?  Robbery?  Arson?  (The examples are limitless).  All these "moral issues" are ALSO issues of law.<br>  <br>  SOME people believe that killing an embryo or a fetus is just as wrong as killing a human being.  And many of these people are atheists.<br>  <br>  2)  Having said that, I would also like to take issue with the absurdity of equating the "killing" of an embryo or a fetus with the "killing' of a human being.  <br>  <br>  AN EMBRYO IS NOT A HUMAN BEING.  The destruction of an early stage embryo IS NOT and can never be conceived as murder.  You can only murder a human being.  <br>  <br>  For example it frequently happens that a patient in a hospital is declared "brain dead," and the subsequent "pulling of the plug" is not considered murder.  These doctors are not prosecuted.  A body (or any mass of cells) is NOT a human being unless it is capable of ratiocination and self-awareness.  <br>  <br>  Thus an early stage embryo or fetus IS NOT A HUMAN BEING BY ANY DEFINITION.<br>  <br>  3)  Also note that the MOTHER IS a human being who also has a right to life!  And obvious example of an abortion which is perfectly justified occurs when a tubal implantation is destroyed to preserve the mother's life.<br>  <br>  4)  Having said the above I am not condoning the arbitrary ending of the "life' of an embryo or fetus.  This is a POTENTIAL human life and thus is to be regarded with SOME rights.  However exactly what these rights are and when does the mother's rights surpass the rights of the potential human being is a matter for further debate.  But I would consider that the terminatiuon of an embryo or fetus require cogent reason.<br>  <br>  Of course eventually we DO get to the stage of a developing fetus where there IS HUMAN LIFE.  When the fetus IS capable of ratiocination and being self-aware there then IS a human life.  And now we are at a greater conundrum.  NOW we sometinmes must judge which life is more "valuable' or "worthy of continued existence."  Of course I AM implying that to "kill" this fetus at this stage can be recognized as murder, despite what the law now states.  I believe that the termination of the life of a fetus capable of ratiocination and self-awareness requires at least the judgment that it is necessary to "save" the mother's life or serious injury.  Again this is a matter for further debate.<br>  <br>  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>  You made the statement "Aren't you afraid that god will toss you into hell for desecrating his gift of Free Will?"<br>  <br>  Are you really serious?  Does one "desecrate the gift of free will" from stopping someone from killing an adult?  Does one "desecrate the gift of free will" when we even put up a stop sign at an intersection and expect people to stop?<br>  <br>  GET REAL!<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  AH!  <br>  FIREBALL is at it again.  She stated: "CUZ IT IS MURDER"<br>  I wonder if she is capable of logical or critical thought.  Please define murder and explain exactly WHY the termination of an early stage embryo can possibly be considered as such?  And also explain why it is murder if our intention is to save the mother's life.<br>  <br>  AND PLEASE ANSWER THIS QUESTION:  "Not doing something is ALSO a choice.  IF not doing anything KILLS the mother then why is THAT not murder?<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  WOW   <br>  IAMACATHOLIC finally has made a statement that is NOT reflective of the "official" Catholic view.  And not just on the issue of abortion but more importantly on the issue of democracy.  <br>  <br>  It was not until Vatican II [1964] before the "Vatican" officially allowed that democracy MAY be a legitimate form of government.  But there was a caviat.  They added the following in their Documents of Vatican II:<br>  ". . .government . . . is to be controlled by juridicial norms which are in conformity with the objective moral order.'<br>  And subsequent passages delineate that this "objective moral order" is ONLY as defined by the Catholic Church!

If English is your first language, it will be a challenge to learn the new sounds and tongue movements, just as it is for those of Asian languages to learn English.<br>  <br>  English and most Western languages have their roots in Latin, while Asian languages originally began as symbols.<br>  <br>  Keep working on it and you'll be very good at it, I'm sure!|`|ZAjlZEXAaa	Don't speak it with your family then, speak it with your friends.<br>  Or teach it to foreign students.<br>  This way you'll practice and teach it to yourself at the same time.<br>  Don't despair!|`|w3plOs6uaa	Well sweety the only way u r ever gonna learn to speak it is try! i dont think ur family would laugh at u if u made a mistake but yet show the right way to say it.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	You know I'm the same. My first language is French and although I understand it and can read it, I have avoided speaking it from about 2 years of being in the UK - just like you because I don't want to be seen to make mistakes. I did that for lots of years until I came up with the right answer.<br>  I took some conversational classes (in secret) with non-French speakers who are learning French . . .  it works. It's giving me confidence and it's working (still not talking to my family in French but I use the odd sentence here and there just as practise) but I speak in French to my colleagues. Last year I went to France with a non-French speaking person and used my French, hesitantly at first (and they didn't expect much) but then I got better. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
AA11440601	The Catholic Church teaches: <br>  <br>  Organ transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the physical and psychological dangers and risks incurred by the donor are proportionate to the good sought for the recipient. <br>  <br>  Donation of organs after death is a noble and meritorious act and is to be encouraged as a manifestation of generous solidarity. <br>  <br>  It is not morally acceptable if the donor or those who legitimately speak for him have not given their explicit consent.<br>  <br>  Pope John Paul II's encyclical Evangelium Vitae states:<br>  1. Organ and tissue donation is heroic and praiseworthy.<br>  2. The donor must be dead before organs and tissue can be harvested.<br>  3.

One cannot have youth only and not old age, light only and no darkness, good only and no evil. We cannot get out of this world of dual experience. In this world there will always be birth and death, growth and decay, construction and destruction; that is the nature of the world. The basic condition of the world does not change. Eventually a person becomes convinced that there is no assurance of security in the temporal order, no prospect of unalloyed joy in this relative universe characterised by a playground of dualities.
R5UIMBvcaa	The outstanding example is the Cyclops incident in Book 9.  When the sailors hear that the island is inhabited by cyclopes, they want to ger away while they can, but Odysseus wants to sick around because he had never seen a cyclops and this is probably his only chance.  As a result, they all wind up trapped in the cave, where Polyphemus eats some of them  Odysseus thinks of a way to get the rest of them safely out, but if he hadn't been so curious to see a Cyclops, they wouldn't have been in that situation in the first place.  After that he is more careful about the welfare of his crew.

K3PR7Mivaa	What a blessing it has been to read these encouraging truths from your answers, my favorite thing about Y!A is the Lord is here. Despite the blinded questions and blinded answers that swarm around here, there is a piercing Light that is woven on Evey question and answer. This Light is so brilliant, and powerful, though a person is completely blind and in the dark, the Power that is Jesus, gives people the ability to see Him.  He is here working and not just on the unsaved, lost, rebellious people, but us as believers who seek Him and know His Light that allows us to see. It causes us also to walk in brighter light, revealing more and causing us to grow.    This question like many others have opened my eyes to see things clearer and in ways that I hadn't noticed before. Praise His Holy Name, Jesus has opened our blinded eyes spiritually and to see the truth of Salvation, but we still at times need to not take our eyes of the scriptures: Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path, its words will I hide in my heart that I might not sin against thee.(ref. Psalms 119 :105,119:11)  The Light of God's precious word continuously sheds His love and light that guides us on our walk with Him, but at times we chose to be blind to the truths He sets before us, either from fear of what the Light may reveal,(need to change our lives) or lack of faith, or sometimes, we're not ready for more(don't understand the milk, can't handle the meat). With lack of Light and lack of seeing, causes decay and darkness to set in stunting our growth. We as children of God need to not be content in our ignorance's, and as sister Sandy said, our religions(that make us put God in our ideas and boxes), but rather seek after the Light of the Lord that allows us to see the Beauty, Power, Majesty, Love, Holiness, and Truth that He is; which leads us to be humble, loving, long suffering to others, compassionate, and able to surrender to His will for our lives..     I was blinded to the fact that God could use even Y!A to bless me, challenge me, cause me to seek His answers, and find wonderful fellow believers to edify His work in my Life... He is working in so many ways opening so many eyes and shedding His loving Light into heart beyond peoples expectations...    God Bless you all, and my He continue to brighten your life with His Light|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    Time after time the Pharisees tried to discredit the Lord Jesus, but couldn't.  In fact, each time they tried to discredit Jesus, it resulted in bringing more honor to Him.  The man's testimony here, is just awesome.  He did not know too much about the Person of Jesus, but he did know that though once he was blind, now he saw.  This was a testimony that no one could deny.  So it is the case of those who have been born again.  The world may doubt, and scoff and sneer, but no one can deny our testimony when we say that once we were lost, and now we have been saved by the Grace of God; and a result of anything we could have done.  Glory to the Lamb of God.  Who was, Who is, and Who is still to come.  Amen.|`|5JqCObDSaa	This one thing is so important to me because when your blind and can't see you don't know what is coming your way, but seeing is knowing and I am really glad I know what I know now because it brought about a glorious change in my life, and change that has eternal benefits and for that I am eternally grateful to the Lord because I once was blind and now I see(know the truth), and have been set free!|`|2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	Thanks for asking this, I love this question. How is knowing this one thing important?    John 9:25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.     This thing that this blind man spoke of he " knew " it, he knew it without a shadow of a doubt, he knew,that he knew, that he knew, that he was blind but now he sees. When we know something so deep within us, it doesn't matter what others say, it doesn't matter what the circumstances look like ( they tried to convince him Jesus was a sinner, but we know Jesus never sinned and was and is perfect ) when you know something for sure, it is like an anchor that no matter all of these things it can't be taken away from you. This is something that a lot of people don't understand that are lost, their eyes and hearts are blinded to the truth and many of them think that we follow Jesus because of tradition; But like this man we are fully persuaded because we know Him, and He has changed us, opened our eyes and hearts to the truth of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, and no one can take that away. This man knew what happened to him was real, and nothing anyone could say to him would change that, and I love that when the Lord opens your eyes you worship Him, because for the first time you see Him as He truly is, and He is worthy of all praise, glory and thanks for ever and ever.    John 9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?   36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?   37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.   38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.     with all sincerity,  andrew|`|ctOge9SLaa	This is such a powerful portion and thank you brother for sharing it with us.  AMEN! Once we were blind, but now we see.  How we need to be those who are so simple before the Lord, with childlike faith.   This man did not have many words that he could use to expound his experience, he just stuck with the fact that all his life, he was feeling around in darkness and that this Person, Jesus Christ healed him of his blindness. He was no longer one who was a slave of darkness, he was one who had received his sight.. HE CAN SEE!.    How the Pharisees and those who generally doubt desire to know the " how's' and " why's" and " how can you's".  Left up to them, this poor man would remain blind physically as they were spiritually.  He is such a powerful picture of having a simple heart that is able to receive by faith.  And the Pharisees are the example of a heart that is unturned and veiled and unable to receive any light from the Lord.    How we need to be touched by the Lord from being religious in any way.  Of doubting or questioning His speaking to us from His word.  I am afraid many times we even approach the bible as a book of knowledge rather than something that is for our very existence and going on.  This man did not care for the complicated things, all he knew was that true sight came through this Man Jesus Christ.  that one minute he was the sad blind person he knew all his life and the next, He was able to look into the face of Jesus Christ and behold Him.    May our hearts continually be in the motion of turning to the Lord throughout our day saints.  It is by being turned, that we are unveiled, and able to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord. Its here that we are transformed from all our oldness into His newness .. Into His very image we are conformed, from glory to glory. It is here we receive fresh revelation of who the Lord is.     Hallelujah.  Lord Jesus.. Keep my heart turned and ever turning to You today.    Grace be with you brother Jimmy and all our dear brothers and sisters here on the forum.  Much grace be with all those who are like this man, will be willing to say, I do not see what You are all about, Jesus, there is something in me that is  blind to you... "I want to see.  Reveal Yourself to me in some way today."      Your sis  sandy    Amen to brother Andrew's sharing ...   ~the Body builds itself up in love~    Amen also to sister giggle's wonderful portion.  Thank You Lord Jesus for all the riches in the Body .|`|grwtwPbAaa	hahahaha!...more later...I was blind yes...and now the Lord has rubbed my  eyes...and opened my heart...more to follow!    Last night Jimmy, when I saw this post my heart was so full of joy...and laughter for the Goodness of Our Lord....but now today...I am more down to earth.  What would our lives be   like...without being able to go to Our Lord?      You know...I have being so touched by Christ  and he won't let me go far away into wilderness areas ...He is entering into so many chambers of my heart, and He is carrying me in his arms of grace so much of the  time...in my life Jimmy... I am learning...that the Word of God is my faithful friend!  Christ is our friend...and His Holy Spirit is fighting for us to see all that the Lord has for us!      If we learn the Word of God  we can't help but learn the Lords'  ways!  A great deal of damage happens in our hearts  not by evil but by ignorance!  We get too caught up in other things...and we are even lazy!      Christ tells us that His truth will set us free..(Jh 8:32)  but so often we don't know the truth of God  properly because we don't dig into His Word enough !  Also many of us don't know how to dig it out!  This is so important to our growth!  WE need help from the Holy Spirit and we need our pastors and wiser in the Word brothers and sisters shedding light!  WE need the body ofChrist in all it's diversity!     In Roman 12:2 Paul tells us that our lives are to be transformed by the renewing of our minds.   What I am seeing from the Lord is to know his Words...as much as I can!  So ...I have a firm grasp on what God's paths are!  If we have no frim grasp on what God's Word is, how can any of us be changed by it?      Personally I  need to spend time in His word by myself for this is how I  develop a  deeper personal realtionship with him.  But sometimes I don't know how!  I am thankful for questions like these which help me to see!  The questions which help me to remove my shades so that I can see and discern the Word of God!     This passage of scripture you are referring to, shows us that Jesus heals a blind man who can't see.  The Pharisees badger the healed man!  They hate the fact that Jesus preforms miracles and heals those who are sick!  They know He is different from other men...they sense (many divisions exist in the Pharisee group ) He is God !  The may even know..of this I am not sure!    This blind man finally cuts through to the heart of thier  issues and attacks against Christ, he defends Christ! This healed man  is berated  as the Pharisees try to see sin in Jesus! They hope to make this healed man say HIs healing was from evil!  The healed man proclaims...boldly on behalf of Christ!   The healed man proclaims..."  If this man were not from God, He could do nothing!"   The Parisees throw him out but Jesus finds him  and believes in Him.  Jesus concludes by revealing the state of the Pharisees's hearts by saying ..."The blind see, and those who claim to see are blind.  Only if they could not see they would be guiltless.  But because they could see if only they would, the guilt of the leaders remained vs (39-41).      The blind man is bolder here than anyone even than under attack!  The Pharisees are looking for a way to explain away Jesus' miracles...and they just can't.  They  were divided over weather to believe in Jesus, and wondered how they would explain yet another miracle away...  So they harrass this healed man...by asking him "Do you want to become His disciple too?"  (9:27)  This remark drips with sarcasm and reflects the blind mans frustration with the constant nagging of the Pharisees!  This blind man takes a POSITION ...and says to the Pharisees...that nothing will change the blessing He received from Christ!  The blessing of sight restored was so great to him!  He shares His faith by being bold, and taking His Position...He stands for and with Christ!      So how does this verse speak to my heart and what do I see?   ...we must remember who Christ is, once we have been given sight Jimmy!  There is nothing, nothing of greater value to us as a people than  to have had the Lord rub our eyes, open our hearts and implant himself into our centres!   He will regenerate us and renew our minds.  He will teach us and lead us to His truths through the Holy Spirit!     None of us will be able to claim ignorance... so we must press forward with the Lord...and see all of his spiritual truth no matter what attacks us....we will see if truths if we are willing to accept His truths!        The obvious thing here is that we must POSITION ourselves in Christ, be BOLD   and keep FOCUSING ON CHRIST FOR TRUTH  and all of His blessed Words...not allow ignorance to be our excuse!  You know brother the Devil will still try to take us down...so we must determine to not become blinded to this truth...seeing the Lord always  as our first love and prize....this  is our first commandement and loving him with all of our heart, souls and mind!  Praise the Lord!    God bless you brother...Christs words light our paths!  WE are not blind once he rubs our eyes open and frees us!      Hallelujah!|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Sure.  Why not?  Look in the real world.

Besides his more well known occupations of carpenter and free-style battle emcee, Jesus' original passion was in laser eye surgery. While in school, however, Jesus spent a little too much time boozing and getting his D wet and in turn failed out. Embarrassed, Jesus returned home and used his influence to have people claim they were blind, but he surgically fixed their vision, fearing his dad would find out.    I'm with you Jesus! I was blind, but now I see!|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Shalom bother      : )  It's important b'c it's the beginning of our spiritual awakening.  It's just the beginning of something i can't describe here - but i know when i share it with people face to face  they see something that lights a spark in them - it's wonderful to see their reaction -- it's like when WE  are awakened, people around us get the first glimpse of the living God and think  ''I must find out what this is about'' ...    What i love about this story is: the blind man wasn't reading a religious book - he had an encounter with Jesus and his life changed dramatically - this is what excites me about  the Lord - just a  touch and we are on fire again - He  knows exactly what we need.    Great question Jimmy    ; )  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    All Great answers.    I love Andrews - especially v28:  Lord i believe and he worshipped Him.

We are blind until Jesus sets us free and opens our eyes.|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	It's funny if you think about it.  I would always describe religious folks as "blinded by religion"....

Can't you just hear him?  "Don't you people get it? I was blind and now I SEE!!!"  His yoke is easy.

May I just add my humble 'Amen' and reiterate the words of that famous gospel hymn:    Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  that saved a wretch like me.  I once was lost, but now can see,  was deaf but now I hear.    I was spiritually blind, deaf and dead until the Holy Spirit got to work in my life and brought me to the foot of the cross in repentance and humble adoration. I had abandoned God after rejecting the religion I had been brought up in, but God had not abandoned me.    Oh, happy day! Where had I been all my life? Praise God for his goodness and his mercy and may we be ever mindful to share the good news with others - and let the Holy Spirit get on with his job of regenerating otherwise dead and lost souls.
4ew4ogH8aa	Don't get married to a guy you've been OFF with multiple times. You'll do it again and then you'll have to go through all the paperwork of divorce. <br>  <br>  First of all, YOU shouldn't have lied to him. Bad precedent. It sucks that his family doesn't like you much, sorry. But, if this ever works out, that wont matter too much. He'll be your family. But I don't think this WILL work. Obviously he is NOT okay with you being with multiple partners and him. You're going to have to compromise first before you go any further. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't stand up for you, why not? Think about it. Does he really want to be with you? More importantly, do you want to be with HIM?! <br>  <br>  You sound like you want to play the field more, rather than settle down to a serious, even if its not only him, relationship. So, DON'T GET MARRIED. You'll **** up your life, and you sound like you have enough problems to sort through already.|`|rThIVk2maa	If you have to ask if you should leave him or marry him, for heaven's sake DON'T MARRY HIM.

If you found a guy that you want to marry someday, don't mess that up by going out with girls. That's cheating... whether he's OK with it or not. You want to marry him... not his family. At least try and set a good example for yourself while they think about whether they want to really get to know you.|`|O4jGlC2caa	It is possible to love a guy but hate the in-laws.  Sounds like that will be the case here.  You can find ways to avoid the in-laws.  You don't have to be their friend.  Yeah, he should stand up for you, but some are mama's boys and incapable of standing up to their mother.<br>  <br>  My only concern is the bisexual part.  He may be OK with it, but what if you have children?  If word gets out you are having sex with women while married to a man, you could create a whole lot of problems for the kids, ESPECIALLY in a small town.  <br>  <br>  I can't tell you whether or not you should get married, although being with one man most of your life may skew your view of things.  You also have to see how strong that umbilical cord is.  I do suggest that if you get married, you move far away from that town and have little to no contact with those in-laws.    Also, of course, keep your sexual feelings in check.

PnMtlZ0Yaa	You need to gradually build up the amount of time that you bounce, and alternate days you bounce to allow for muscle recovery.     After a very hard bounce session, you may feel somewhat stiff, but with a little stretching and proper warm-up, this feeling should go away quickly.     Sore muscles are usually damaged muscles. As with any injury, sore muscles must be given time to heal. This may require a few easy days of bouncing, or another light workout. After a few days you can begin to push harder again.    But don't go too hard or too fast, because you'll wind up back on the sidelines again. Remember, the best way to prevent or reduce muscle damage is prior physical conditioning.     Do you have video to share of you bouncing? It might be your technique... If bouncing is sexual and you are a woman over 18, I may be able to offer a free personal consultation ;)

Mary   also mary is considered in islam , as a very great woman and the purest woman on earth , but not as mother of God !! whom he had made pregnant !! , nor his gf!      HolySpirit  the holy spirit is considered as the head of angels and he it is called gebrael , but its not a part of God nor any divine , he is just a creation of the One and Only true God that is in heaven .      2- Upon reading quran i found many amazing facts from those i found is scientific facts or miracles i will mention some of them:    Few miracles Of Quran   Big Bang  When describing the creation of the "heavens and the earth," the Qur'an states the theory of the "Big Bang" explosion at the start of it . the Qur'an says that "the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before they were aparted:   Quran (21:30) {Have not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We cloved them asunder} [cloved them asunder means separated them].  and this was 1400 years before the discovery of the big bang theory.    Expansion of Universe  this amazing theory was discovered in the 20th century that the universe is continuing to expand after the big bang explosion,,   this idea ; that the universe is continuing to expand. was mentioned in quran 1430 years ago : {and The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are still expanding it} quran (51:47).        furthermore, In nicia council constantine forced people on only 4 gosepels , and burned alot of gosepels that said jesus was only a human prophet no more, and he killed those who oposed trinity , thus forcing trinity on christians ,    Constantine was a roman pagan all his life , he wanted to be called christian but he also wanted to maintain his roman believes , so what he did was that he inserted the pagan beliefs of trinity and idol or statues glorifying and worshiping into christianity , thus deviating christianity from the true word of God ..    thats why nowadays muslims r the real christians (followers of jesus) cause they follow the belief that jesus used to believe and the things he used to command , and they dont follow a diverted or a pagan originated believe.    Conclusion:     finally and in conclusion... The concept of God taught by Islam is, the Supreme being who is uncreated , anyone who is created, born or dies is not God.    islam is simplicity , clearness , direct teachings , and absolute uniqness of God , no embeded paganism or multi Gods.    i found that islam is the only religion that claims absolute uniqness of God and really means it and thus islam is the only religion today that follow the first commandment of all commandments to moses and jesus and mohammed which is :    "For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, [is] a jealous God:" [Exodus 34:14]  and jesus said:  after one of the scribes asked him Which is the first commandment of all? Jesus answered him, "The first of all commandments is, Hear, O Israel The Lord our God is one Lord" [Mark 12:28to33]   and in Quran : "Say, He is God, The One and Only" (112:1)   amen.
6ec6afa27ccfe7badb1528fec2817bfcaa	wrong section for this question, but ok...   Why would it be not right for a girl to ask a guy out? Hey, we are living in the 21st century!! If you feel too nervous about it because you are afraid he might reject you.. well that's all in the game: guys go through that too when they want to ask a girl out.   If you really don't want to be the one asking for a date: you could start with something like "I really like your company", and see how he responds to that. If positive, go for the next step, and tell him you would like to share something (a visit to a museum, a concert, a swim, something you like to do), without making it sound like a real date, just sharing time as good friends, and take it from there. If he does not make a move towards taking the friendship to another level.. hm.. he must be VERY shy, or he just is not interested in you that way...   You must realize that feeling sorry for something you did is worse than feeling sorry for something you did NOT do...  Good luck!

aO4iCwtoaa	No.  If you're Christian, circumcision is not required.    Even if you're Jewish, where circumcision is required, the commandment is to have your son circumcised (it's a commandment to the parent, not the child).  So a parent who refuses to do so could be considered guilty of a sin, but not the boy himself.  Though when that boy becomes a man he would still be expected to have the procedure done if he wished to be a part of the Jewish community.      Beyond that, there is a fairly rare medical condition of the foreskin which makes circumcision dangerous to the child.  When this occurs, you are not allowed to circumcise, as we may not willfully endanger our health. In that case a ritual drop of blood is drawn, but circumcision is not - and again, it is the parent's commandment and not the child's.    I don't know whether this answer applies in Islam, which does mandate circumcision, as I don't have a full understanding on their approach to sin.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Of course not    Harriet|`|4arnbpUCaa	No, Graeme, of course its not a sin.

mGZCXPbTaa	No, you do not need religion to instill morals in a person.  Religion can be (and is) used for some very immoral purposes (think of the spanish inquisition, crusades, and more recently Jihadists using religion as a means to do things that were and are immoral).<br>  <br>  I think of religion as a good tool for giving peace of mind for when bad things happen, or about what happens when a person dies.<br>  <br>  Do you really think if there was no religion people would be out in the streets killing and screwing?|`|U1lmbP7kaa	atheists do not answer to these forums to "rile" people up. we answer to give our honest opinion, just the same as anybody else would. i hate how people say that athiests look for nothing better than to make fun of "religious" people.|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	People chose to keep themselves in order, no religion in the world can do that for us.

They can't back up an opinion that they didn't get from a bible quote. <br>  <br>  If society thinks alike, the less likely society will turn on each other for the right reasons, such as vengence. It's easier & quieter to turn the other cheek but really, it's for those who are scared they'll get hit in the mouth for saying something they shouldn't have. <br>  <br>  Keep the people in a line, stuff their mouths with paper, delete their brain & make them mindless, have them follow each other off a cliff like zombies. Why not, it's the easy way.|`|sfTPrMFpaa	Not at all, many studies show it's all in the brain:<br>  <br>  Most of us feel a rush of righteous certainty in the face of a moral challenge, an intuitive sense of right or wrong hard to ignore yet difficult to articulate.<br>  <br>  A provocative medical experiment conducted recently by neuroscientists at Harvard, Caltech and the University of Southern California strongly suggests these impulsive convictions come not from conscious principles but from the brain trying to make its emotional judgment felt.<br>  <br>  Using neurology patients to probe moral reasoning, the researchers for the first time drew a direct link between the neuroanatomy of emotion and moral judgment.<br>  <br>  Knock out certain brain cells with an aneurysm or a tumor, they discovered, and while everything else may appear normal, the ability to think straight about some issues of right and wrong has been permanently skewed.|`|AA10351810	Society depends on laws to keep people in line with what that society accepts as OK in general.

First and foremost, religion is very useful for keeping people in check.  Just look back in history and you'll find endless accounts of oppression and fear mongering by religious & political leaders. The fact is that organized religion started out as nothing more than a means of controlling primitive people and we still see that in society today.  Secondly, you have to take into consideration that religion wouldnt be such a bad thing were it not for those people who purposely use it to manipulate and exploit others.  The problem is, how do you keep people from abusing the influence and power that religion has on the masses? Dont forget, for all of the good that religion may have done, more people have perished in the name of God than by any other cause|`|htQrkD8waa	religion is not the sole vehicle to "keep people in line".<br>  <br>  religion might be a tool which some parents teach thier children morality and social norms- and religions antiquated social norms get in the way more often than not.<br>  <br>  i don't remember my mom telling me "stealing is wrong because god says so" just "stealing is wrong".<br>  <br>  a childs listening to a parent is inborn- that is the thing that gets kids to listen- whether the parent chooses to communicate it through a series of statements, lectures, admonisions, or fairy tales (religious fairy tales or otherwise) is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  religion might be a delivery system- but if we examine the effectiveness of that delivery system rather than just "getting to the point" you cut through a lot of the crap- do you really think parents teach thier kids to "stone blasphemers to death"?<br>  <br>  its the childs natural reaciton to listen to the parent, unfortunately most parents ignore thier children and the responsibility of raising them giving excuses of "its so difficult" bullcrap- you are LAZY!<br>  <br>  its ALWAYS been difficult- but instead of worrying about bb guns and bottlerockets you worry about the internet.<br>  <br>  actually with all the parental controls on technology its probably EASIER- parents just can't be bothered to use them and thus lose that respect along the line making it more difficult to get thier children to obey later.<br>  <br>  ultimately the real world system of law and punishment keep people in order- and it is not "god" but a jury of your peers that has the final say in this.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	No.|`|WalnRzfGaa	No people that know the laws and understand what consequences there are to the laws tend to keep people in line. that's just common sense.<br>  <br>  no the police would not keep them all in line, but the army would if it got to be that massive.<br>  <br>  you talk of Morals, but in the bible it says you have sex with a family member, kill people that work on sunday and were mixed threads.

Atheists rile people up but you don't see them murdering anybody. Mainly because they will be arrested and sentenced to jail or death. Also, you don't see them running around saying "there is no god, so lets steal!". And most religious people (in some religions) do commit crimes or breach thier beliefs in some way. Thats why they have confession.

There can be agnostic theists, or agnostic atheists.    Atheists do not believe there is a god. Period.     Satanists (unless they are taking the label to shock, which one group does) believe there is a god.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Agnostic is a stance of "we will never know".    There are Christian Agnostics, Agnostic Atheists and so on.    "Atheist to satanist"....What?|`|v1dnnMQuaa	Agnostics dress better than atheists.

Satanist is that you belive in satan - you do not have to be a satanist to be an atheist.  As an atheist I don't believe in Satan or God.|`|3lMujNUZaa	An agnostic expresses the point of view that there is a possibility that god may exist.  An atheist on the other hand is firm in his/her belief that due to lack of evidence it is no likelihood that god exists.  I doubt any atheist would be a satanist, because satan is an invention of god and the atheist does not believe in god|`|9HKfcJz0aa	Well my view is, Atheist means you don't believe in God or religion, Satanist means you worship satan, Agnostic means you are open to the theory of religion but you don't practice any. I hope that helps a bit.|`|WOb3syqQaa	That is one to ponder - I did once meet a dyslexic insomniac atheist who would lie awake all night wondering if there were such a thing as a dog.

They did prayer alot, but God apparently just ignored them.|`|iHDYncuXaa	They aren't mutually exclusive!|`|APrvPTsNaa	Because God expects us to try and help ourselves, not just behave like infants and expect everything to be brought to us when we cry. By your reckoning, no one should have bothered inventing/learning anything. God gives us knowledge, and expects us to use it.    So, my opinion is hilarious, and only yours is valid? Why ask the question then?|`|S0c2MR5Gaa	I do. and just because He doesn't heal me from whatever ails me makes Him not the God who heals? that is plain ridiculous! You make God look like He is a genie in a bottle, required to answer your every "wish." You really have no idea, what you are talking about, do you?? And you mock us about believing in this fairy tale, as you cal it?  I am astounded that you are guided by your own feeble mind. Please don't discuss something you think you understand.

Everyone was born with inbred morals and Love.  Love is the common aspect among humans, not religion.  I can't understand how religious folks feel that it is all about them.  It really is amazing to me....  Religious folks do nothing but judge everyone everyday, all day long instead of working on their own issues.<br>  <br>  Religion breeds conditional limited thinking.  It is very apparent in these questions.  I'm so sorry you were taught this way.....<br>  <br>  I don't judge.  It isn't a matter of right or wrong, period.  I'm very peaceful with my beliefs and have no desire to disrupt yours, I just can't understand why religious people have this need to interfere in the lives of others that don't conform to their own beliefs.  It really is puzzling.  :)<br>  <br>  I could care less if someone doesn't agree with me, I don't force anyone to agree with me.  That isn't the point.  I am me, you are not me.

It really is very simple.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	So, you're saying that you would be immoral without your religion?

I think religion and gods are not necessary. I think one of the shortcomings or downsides of religion actually is it produces some people who think morality is only about doing what a god said and right and wrong are only so because of what a deity set forth. Think about it, if god said child rape was fine would it be? Wouldn't it still engender rage and the desire for retribution in parents and still harm the child?

Sad stuff.|`|AA11700517	I really think that these beautiful Black women need to accept who they are. What they're doing is hurting themselves and admitting to low-self esteem.

Prayer  according  to  me  is  just  talking  to  God  anywhere and anytime.   He  is  our  best  friend  and  always  there for us.  We  can  tell  Him  anything anytime  and  He  is  there.  He  loves  each  one  of  us  as  an  individual  and  is  our  best  friend.

UCq7SjsRaa	Well, we as a family are atheist's. But Christmas for us is all about having family and friend's around. We make sure not to spend a lot of money on presents because that's not what we want Christmas to be about (but we do have a hell of a lot of food!). At easter time we celebrate the arrival of spring and new life by painting eggs and making a beautiful easter egg tree (on the morning of easter my daughter awakes to an abundance of chocolate eggs and fluffy toy rabbits).|`|XkidpdPWaa	We celebrate with an Iron fist to the child's head!<br>  No, I'm kidding.

O4jGlC2caa	People get sick.  Stay home if you get sick, and call a trusted coworker up at the end of the day to get an update on what is going on in the workplace.  I'd rather the busy guy took off work for the day than make me get sick and force ME to take off work for the day.  Really selfish.|`|vnYYH4fMaa	It's better or more recommended for your professional working reputation with your colleagues and company to call in sick. <br>  <br>  The difference between being sick coming to work and meeting a random stranger on a bus or train who is sick is that you don't know them at all.<br>  <br>  That's the main difference. So its better to keep your reputatation intact with the company with professionalism. That's why its good to call in sick.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	You are out of line.  You could get your coworkers sick!  I know that in some offices they give people a hard time if they call in sick (sometimes they think they're faking it) but you clearly work in an office where they would prefer you to stay home when you are ill.  Using their phones and keyboards while sick is bad manners especially if they've already expressed their dismay to you!<br>  <br>  Take advantage of the fact that you work in a place that actually doesn't give you a hard time if you're sick and need to take a day off to recover.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Stay home when you're sick.. it's pointless to come into work and make everyone else sick. We had someone like that at our last office, and HR actually had to step in and ask the person to stay home when they weren't feeling well. It compromises the productivity of the entire office for weeks when you come in and start the chain reaction of everyone getting sick and everyone else having to cover their work as well as their own.|`|rThIVk2maa	Have you been stopping asking your coworkers to get lunch for you? I've been interested to hear how that went. <br>  <br>  When one person in the office is sick, everyone catches it, so  stay home when you are ill and don't pass it around. <br>  <br>  You are disgusting your coworkers, which is clear by your description of their reactions to what you're doing. This is very rude. You're upsetting people you work with, so cut that out.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	You should use your own discretion when you decide whether to come to work sick. If you're really not well, you know you're contagious and you know you're going to feel miserable for 8 hours, then you should stay home.|`|sVNWdW50aa	I don't believe in calling in sick unless I absolutely can't get out of bed. I have very few days off each year, and they are reserved for when my family needs me. I don't have the luxury of being able to miss a day's pay. I do try to avoid co-workers when I'm ill. Since I have my own office, that isn't too hard. I would never dream of using their phone or their keyboards. <br>  I figure if I can work, I should. If the company didn't need me every day, this would be a part-time job.|`|xnsU60hhaa	You are completely out of line and very selfish. If you worked with me, you would be sent home for coming in ill and if it happened again, you would probably get a suspension. I know some offices do allow it, but it is really inconsiderate of you.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes, I think you are.  If you're sick, stay home.  Why infect the whole office and make everybody sick?They give you sick days for a reason.  You're not really doing anyone (including yourself) any favors by working when you're sick.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Well, I am going to rain on your parade today too!  Yes, you should stay home if you're sick.  No, you should not use other people's phones or keyboards when you're sick.  Yes, they do make Lysol wipes and you need to carry them around if you are going to be spreading your germs around!<br>  <br>  When I see a sick person (whether I know them or not), I run the other direction.  Why?  Because when I get sick, I get really sick.  It's not fun.<br>  <br>  I'd like an answer to the question about lunch as well as your first answer person!!!|`|AA10819407	You are to be commended for your loyalty to your job,but...<br>       Sick days are for that, take advantage and use them to get better.<br>       how would you like knowing some one carried your germs home to their children, or an elderly family member, chain reaction, that<br>  may come back to you again...Use the wipes and spray as preventative, before anyone gets sick..<br>  <br>  <br>      Go home....And feel better!!|`|mQZDizMVaa	"I like to portray myself as the busiest person in the office. The last thing I want to do is take sick days off and end up out of the loop."<br>  <br>  Well, I'll be realistic here: Understand that no job is permanent and 'company loyalty' does not exist anymore. It went out with rotary phones.<br>  <br>  I don't wish it on you, but if your company decides to either lay you off, close or merge, do you think they'll say: "Well, don't lay off so-and-so because (he/she) came in sick and was the busiest person in the office."   <br>  <br>  Do yourself and others a favor: use your sick days when you're sick. You won't miss anything by not being in the office.|`|omegLbOAaa	I agree with 'it's here again'. i know how valuable your allotment of sick days are. And if you stayed how *every day* you had the sniffles, you'd used them up quick & you'd get behind on your work.<br>  <br>  that said, when you're sick you need to be respectful of other people. You shouldn't use their phone or their keyboard. I don't know what your work environment is like & why this is necessary, but if you have your own phone/keyboard then use it. If you need to do some work at another person's workstation, then explain to them what needs to be done & let them use their own equipment.<br>  <br>  also, carry around some purell hand sanitizer & use it after you sneeze, cough or before you touch anything someone else might touch after you.

0JE41mXsaa	For non-Christians I would suggest you change your phrasing to:<br>  <br>  "What is the difference between murdering a baby in its crib (typically a 20-year prison sentence) and murdering a baby where it is resting in the womb?"<br>  <br>  To me it always seems to boil down to this unambiguous question.  Why do I go to jail for killing a baby?  But not for an "unborn" baby?  <br>  <br>  CONCLUSIONS:<br>  It makes sense by this logic that if its okay to kill an unborn baby, it should be equally okay to kill a baby... and if that is the case - why is it not okay to kill a child, or a teenager or adult or the elderly?<br>  <br>  So really the question to me is why is a defenseless baby out of the womb protected by law, and the equally defenseless baby within the womb not?  It seems like a contradiction and a slippery slope cheapening human life.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	the only way my parents or family members would use abortion is when someone is raped, and we are a Christian family.  I mean y should that woman be forced to raise that mans child that she didnt want to concieve nor want to have.  Why should she have that baby, and God is with all children, even before they are conceived, and if it isnt His will for the baby to live, than it isnt His will.  Taking a life is wrong but parenthood shouldnt be forced.|`|AA11103371	I think a womans body is her own business.  People with moral objections to abortion should concern themselves with the millions of children worldwide who already live in poverty and are suffering.<br>  <br>  P.S.  No.  It's not a human child.  It's an EMBRYO.  An Embryo is not a person.  A 2 year old in poverty is.  I realize you don't understand the difference.  Take a science class.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	My views and your views aren't what matter.  What matters are the views of the woman who is pregnant.  People who would never dream of forcing a woman to be artificially inseminated apparently have no problem telling a woman that she HAS to carry a pregnancy to term, regardless of her circumstances.|`|LWvh2g2maa	I think it's wrong for that woman to speak at a school.  How dare she fill children's minds with what is only her tiny little opinion!  <br>  Abortion is a personal choice and in some cases necessary.<br>  And the unborn child is NOT a two-year old.  You can't compare the 2.  It's not the same thing.  If it was then we'd be having funerals for miscarriages.|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	I think it's wrong.. but then there are also exceptions.. what if the baby has a problem? what if you were raped then I am pro abortion.. <br>  But then again if it's just some teenager who knew what was going on and went ahead and got herself pregnant like that.. then yeah I'm against it..

People can pick up free, that's right, free birth control at their local HR building. There are also far too many women that get more than one abortion. How many times do they have to make the same mistake in order to learn? It has been scientifically proven that the baby feels pain during this abortion after the seventh month, and an even greater amount of pain during a partial-life abortion. I truly think anyone recieving a partial life abortion has got to be an evil person. Also, in the partial life abortion, did you know that in some states it is legal to starve the child to death if its under 24 hours old and still considered a form of abortion? Sometimes I believe people have a greater respect for an animal's life than for a baby's. I do think a Christian woman would not go through with it because of God's word.|`|heziH5K4aa	Why don't they ever have guest speakers talking about where you can get free birth control and how to use it (local health office)? Pregnancy can be avoided altogether. Most people don't ever say to themselves-you know, I think I want to have an abortion someday. Young adults don't need someone to tell them its wrong, they need someone to tell them how to keep from getting pregnant (besides abstinence-no matter what you say they will still want and try to get sex). Its all about education, not scare tactics and blaming that is so common in this country.|`|NlnM6diMaa	I don't like them it seems to be a rather piss poor form of birth control for some.

Therefore you must go to a private religious school.<br>  <br>  Abortion is legal and should remain so.  I see abortion as one of three viable choices for women.  The other choices being carrying to term and putting the child up for adoption, and carrying to term and keeping the child.   Personally I think abortion on demand up to the first 12 weeks is fine.  All medical people do not consider a pregnancy even viable (meaning the fetus could not exist outside of the womb) until 27 weeks.  I would set the limit for an abortion at 18 except in rare cases of rape, incest, or where the pregnancy is threatening the life of the mother.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	One cell cannot be considered as having equal rights to a two-year-old child. That's ridiculous. It has no qualities with which we would differentiate it from any other animal cell. It has no feelings, emotions, thoughts, memories or desires.<br>  <br>  I think women should be allowed freedom to choose what happens to her own body - I don't think anyone has the right to force a woman to go through a pregnancy and birth against her will. If you ban abortion, you will only send it underground, teenagers will be having unsafe backstreet abortions and risking their health and lives.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	There is no proof that a fetus has a soul and they are not viable without the mother.<br>  <br>  What kind of school do you go to that would allow this biased person to talk such crap?

Can't you understand that?|`|SvEzmp4Laa	If a woman is in high danger of dying during pregnancy an abortion merited.

How can a just society grant 1 citizen the right to kill another, when it has done nothing wrong, simply because it is unseen or causing an inconvenience?<br>  <br>  The Primary reason which Humans grouped together into Tribes,  and Tribes grew into communities, and Communities into City-States and City-States into Governments,  is ALL revolves around stability and mutual protection. One of the BIG reasons to believe in government is that it is SUPPOSE to protect its citizens and create stability.<br>  <br>  Roe vs. Wade,  as it was originally tried and judged,  seems to dilute the governments role as creating safety and protecting the lives of its citizens. It seems to allow government to put arbitrary limits and "narrow" its definition of what a citizen IS.  What constitutes a citizen and/or who is worthy of protection.  BEFORE Roe vs. Wade,  Government saw babies/fetuses as  human life and therefore worthy of protection. Roe vs. Wade was the first time the government "shrunk" its definition of citizen rather then expand it, like it did with the Emancipation (anti-slavery) and Human Rights movements. <br>  <br>  So abortion seems to alter the very thing we think Governments are good at..the MAIN reason we tolerate their bureaucracy, corruption, taxes, and interference in our lives.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be very careful about Justifications that Pro-choice people use AFTER the fact.  They will bring up all sorts of reasons which were not the CENTRAL reason that abortion was even ruled legal in the first place.  They will bring up hypothetical reasons, which MAY be valid, BUT,  We as society,  we as a community,  NEVER got a chance to discuss, and decide on,  because of the way Roe vs. Wade was enacted into law.  SO,  don't be dissuaded by arguments that were thought of AFTER the law was made.  -- They aren't TRULY valid reasons because they were never PART of the original reasoning for the law. <br>  <br>  Also, don't get dissuaded by saying,  "You don't have a right to CHOOSE that for someone else."  - The fact is, in a Democracy,  we don't make choices for someone else,  we decide what WE think.. THEN,  after all the votes are tallied,  we decide what the FINAL decision is.   A democracy doesn't work by YOU trying to vote based on what you "think" I might want...OR by voting based on what will give someone ELSE the most "options" -- that's not how a democracy works.  You should NEVER vote for a law simply to give someone else a choice, UNLESS you believe that "choice"  is actually the BEST choice. <br>  Example: I can vote for School vouchers, which gives people the 'choice" to send their kids to private school,  because I believe that private school is BETTER.  BUT, I shouldn't vote for abortion, merely to give someone else the 'choice"  if I don't think abortion is he best thing to do. <br>  <br>  Saying,  "well I don't PERSONALLY think anyone should get an abortion, but I don't want to make that choice for them"  -- means that they are creating a scapegoat for themselves to not make a real decision as a citizen and a person in a democratic country.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	No one has ever proven the existence of a soul as a metaphysical thing. Various belief systems that do have beliefs in souls have different ideas about when ensoulment occurs. I believe people should be allowed to make this very personal choice for themselves according to their own beliefs and circumstances. For me the issue, with first trimester elective abortion is that this is a fetus that doesn't meet the criteria of personhood. They lack brain development to be aware of their existence or sensation. There can't be equal rights where one potential human is dependent on the body of the existing one. I think the person who will serve as host gets precedence. I think its more important to focus on bringing children into the world where they are wanted and there is the ability to provide and care for them. There are so many suffering already in the world.<br>  <br>  A two year old is self aware, has a brain and nervous system, and is capable of suffering. They also aren't physically dependent in that they need to be hooked up to another person's body in order to breathe, expel waste, and intake nourishment.
e9JRcA35aa	If you start calling and texting him all the time, he's going to think your a psycho. Wait for him to contact you. He's probably just busy and hasn't gotten around to it.

If not, then no, it didn't mean anything. What happens now? that depends on you. You can either wait passively for him to contact you, or you can contact him instead. Not texting, but an actual phone call. Texting is passive, non-communicative, infantile, and non-committal.

He beat her, and beat her child (from a previous relationship), spent or stole all of her money, impregnated her, and left.  Based on my observation, this is not an uncommon outcome in black male/white female relationships.

Ideally, each Christian should devote substantial effort toward recognizing and eliminating their own presuppositions.  We all have them.|`|R26OBoW7aa	Its because the Christians let them selves brain washed in a way that they completely surrender them selves in a delusive way, to a so called omnipotent,omnipresent, all pervasive intelligent planner, that they completely banish reasoning and rationality from their minds. They believe their Lord is in absolute control and command of the universe who also regulate their lives. So according to them when a perfect system is in place and which works according to their preconceived notions other things just cant exist ! It is not known how good is Christianity as a religion but certainly it has been successful in producing hoards of individuals who are insulated from reasoning and rationalism.    Well for that reason all religions do control their followers imagination in a way that it defies reasoning and rationality.

Either JESUS was GOD or HE was a crazy man committing Blasphemy. Too many saw HIS miracles, 500 people saw HIM after HE was Resurrected, how can that be? <br>  I believe HE is GOD.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament isn't a bastardization of the Jewish texts, it is the Jewish texts - it is the Torah plus the major and minor prophets. The only difference is that it isn't in Hebrew but has been translated into english or spanish or whatever. There are different translations but if they are just translations of the original texts it is the same thing, just worded slightly differently. There are 'liberal' translations but I'd personally be wary of them.<br>  <br>  Look into your texts, they point to the Messiah to come - JESUS fulfilled hundreds of those prophecies, a statistical improbability.

Anyone can be, it's just who you are. But as annoying as this sounds, it is well known that many teenagers go through a bisexual phase until they realise what they really want when they are older.

He said he had never done one, but that it was part of the religion to recognize them and deal with them.<br>  <br>  Of course, most people call Catholic priests to do exorcisms.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Heck yes! The Bible talks about driving out demons. (shivers)|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	nope|`|AA10920670	Yes they are. I have been involved in demonology for years. People take the small things for granted an inadvertently let dark things into their lives. Exorcism and deliverance is on the rise, due to the lack of faith. When faith wanes superstition waxes. People turn away from God and begin to dabble in the occult. Even the current "ghost hunting" phenomenon can be problematic to innocent folk.|`|0JE41mXsaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER - let me qualify that by saying that the majority of people with aberations in their behaviour are not possessed in the classical (biblical) sense, but are suffering from some form of mental illness.<br>  <br>  As for exorcisms being real - if you are a Christian then it is easy to look up numerous times in Old Testament and New Testament history when the Devil is present, and/or exorcised by the faithful.<br>  <br>  Orthodox Christians have exorcisms built into our Baptismal Service, and as such are very frequent.  i.e. For each new Christian the prayers of the Church and the grace of the Holy Spirit are called upon to remove Satan and his powers from the one about to be enlightened and sealed by the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  SCRIPTURE...<br>  Example of temptation by the Devil:<br>  Matthew 4:1<br>  Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.<br>  <br>  Example of Posession by the Devil:<br>  Matthew 9:32<br>  As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.<br>  <br>  Examples of Exorcism by Jesus Christ:<br>  Matthew 17:18<br>  And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.<br>  <br>  Luke 8:29<br>  (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)<br>  <br>  Luke 9:42<br>  And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.|`|d4ab69OKaa	Yes, exorcism ceremonies are real. They're still being performed to this day!|`|K07MXHjRaa	yes and they are still performed. a demon can and will take over your body and how else will you get them out? they are very evil and you need some serious Godly help to get them out.|`|MTuUZBzIaa	no, I think they are preachers taking advantage of families with severely mentally ill family members|`|Im9cwUIyaa	No mam.|`|YI8V5e36aa	No|`|SRFfK0BPaa	well I do know that anything that has to do with God or the Devil.. non believers still won't believe|`|kKXZsaLyaa	Unlike others that answered your question, I'm going to back my answer with sources that, if you're interested, you can use yourself to make your own determination.<br>  <br>  Yes, I believe demonic possession is real. If you're a Bible believing Christian then you believe it existed at one time, right? Why would you think it doesn't exist today? Has Satan given up? Hardly.<br>  <br>  Below are some interesting and true books on the subject.<br>  <br>  One of Satan's greatest victories is convincing people he doesn't exist, That is when people are most susceptible.<br>  <br>  To be forewarned is to be forearmed.|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Yes they are real, or let us say they can be. Jesus cast out demons from many and so did His disciples.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes Manson needs one...
WMrNa3Doaa	I think it really depends.<br>  <br>  I think Obama definitely sets a good example for today's black youth.  I think it changes their attitude in the fact  that yes, a black man can get elected as president.  If he can do that, then I think it really expands the horizons that they see and the things they feel that they can accomplish.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I do know some racists people (in my family!!) who probably look down on black people even more.  For instance, my brother thinks that they have gotten "too full of themselves" and that they are going to rise up and take over, and kick the white man down.  My brother IS AN IDIOT!<br>  <br>  So, I think it's mostly positive, aside from the hard-core bigot crowd.|`|lF65kGdyaa	No, but i think once we get further into his presidency and people see how this country COULD HAVE been run the entire  time (the last 20 years for example) they will realize that whitey was and is, the devil....brotha.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	NO, i think its about the same|`|vGWD8Zncaa	I believe that internationally things have changed more than domestically.  People are no longer looking at the USA as pandering to "rich, spoiled WASPs".<br>  <br>  I can only hope black people also start viewing themselves differently.  If blacks start taking more pride in themselves, valuing knowledge, self-improvement and proper speech, then that will also help end the vast racial gulf which exists in our society.<br>  <br>  After all, Barack Obama is a much better role model than most illiterate, hate-mongering rappers and criminals like the Jena 6.|`|30b80549ef581ba10302258d8ca2bfbaaa	hell no lol|`|BQXg09m9aa	No, not really.

Little is more unbecoming on a woman in a suit at a business meeting than slurping spaghetti, or a man meeting with clients and talking with food in his mouth.<br>  <br>  It's not funny.

7J9Eb3VCaa	Ooh those all sound really fun. The Twilight saga theme sounds great especially since she loves the books. Also its such a phenomenon there will be many many decorations, ideas online all kinds of things to help you plan your party. Doing it semi-formal is a great idea because it's no fun to have just a lame boring party especially for a sweet sixteen, it will make her feel special that everyone took time to dress up for her. Now you can incorporate the book serious by maybe having the semi-formal have something to do with vampires. In most movies vampires are well dressed and a little fancy with their gothic looking dresses and such. It's always fun to get so involved in a party like you're in another world for the night. You can serve things like red punch with dry ice so the fog looks cool. I'm sure you will have no problem with this party there are many great websites and party stores to help you out. I hope that helps, good luck!|`|lRJHT36Saa	Moulin Rouge theme!!<br>  Fabulous dresses, great make-up... an excuse to really have fun!

QHf2Ov6yaa	most wiccans won't do this for you. number one, a spell works better when YOU write it yourself, as it has your energy in it. number two, love spells are unethical, as it manipulates someone else's free will. why don't you just do a spell to bring love to you, in general. that way you're not manipulating anybody, and you never know, that love you bring just might be him.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	You're desperate...so who would be in love with you?  You've made yourself very unattractive by being desperate.  You've pushed love away by getting all grabby with it, trying to make things into something they're not.<br>  <br>  You need to work on your confidence and try to be a fulfilled, happy person.  You're in no condition to be in love, and that's why you feel so alone.  You have to love yourself first--all love stems from taking good care of yourself first.  It's the idea of putting the oxygen mask on yourself first before you put it on somebody else.<br>  <br>  You're in no position to be in a healthy relationship, and maybe not even an unhealthy one.  That's not a spell issue.  That's a personal growth issue.<br>  <br>  Even if he were the right one, YOU are the wrong one for him right now!  You have to love yourself so that other people see what's so important and special about you, and then they'll love you more.  Love attracts love.<br>  <br>  Desperation doesn't attract anything you want in your life.  <br>  <br>  Confidence, self-assurance, security...those all attract love.  People want to love people that know how to love.  You love yourself, they know you can do it.  So work on taking care of yourself and ditch all your ideas about love spells.  <br>  <br>  You need to work hard and care about yourself.  No spell will do that for you.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	If you don't want to hear the truth, then why ask for something that you cannot have?<br>  <br>  First, witches (rather well respected witches) will not hand out spells to those whose experience is unknown, and probably lacking in areas.<br>  <br>  Second, if you need a spell to get a guy to like you, then you need to work on your self esteem rather than trying to get someone to like you. You need to learn to love yourself, once that is done, others will love you too.<br>  <br>  Third, if he loves you, he will come on his own and tell you he loves you. If not, you must move on...you CANNOT make someone love you...even with spells. Not that it's unethical, it's not possible. <br>  <br>  Don't want the truth, don't ask silly questions.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	U unleash something with a spell, and wutever you send out, u will get back x3, and with this the love u create with a love spell is not true love, it is only something he is controlled by and that wud be 2 love u.|`|IPAdOJ4Naa	"Sounds like your the one,..under a love spell,...<br>  think about it,...." im desperate, i cant live my life with out him",..<br>  Try Victoria's Secret Love Spell,..works for me,...matter a fact<br>  got it from my" can do" with out him,..on Valentine's Day,...peace"take care,..|`|gNFPy6S0aa	Try this potion on him:<br>  <br>  60mL gin<br>  4mg flunitrazepam|`|AA10430184	No can do.<br>  That is forcing someone to go against their free-will and any legitimate and intelligent Pagan/Wiccan/Heathen/Witch will not give you such a spell.|`|GROkWyBAaa	You should stop being so desperate, put on some make-up, look nice, and ask him out.<br>  <br>  Obsession is not a healthy thing.

If this person doesn't love you on his own, then such a spell would only give him the illusion that he is in love with you and must be with you.  Do you have no respect for yourself?  Do you feel you don't deserve real love?  That the only way you're going to have someone in your life is by tricking them to be in it with magic?  That's very sad.<br>  <br>  Yes, it could hurt the both of you to try it.  His subconscious mind would eventually fight the effects of the spell and he could in fact become violent towards you.  (Because you are attempting to make him do something against his will.)<br>  <br>  But in all honesty, if you've no experience working magic - then no spell is likely to work for you.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can live your life without him or anyone else.  When you learn how to be happy with yourself as an individual, then it will be easier for you to find real love.<br>  <br>  Blessings.|`|m3f0Pa5oaa	NO.  That would affect his free will, and no Wiccan will help you do that.  You also have no idea about magic, which means it WILL seriously hurt you to try.<br>  <br>  I suggest solving this the old fashioned way.  Ask him about his feelings.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Yes, magical spells are not good to use.

Some people here report anything they disagree with even though it wasn't in violation of the guidelines, and if it gets appealed, you now have less power to get some one's question or answer deleted.  So that goes to show people should stop being sensitive and reporting anything they see.  I don't like racist questions either, but I don't report them, I just don't answer them.

Surely, James - Jesus' brother knew Jesus. James wrote the Epistle of James in the Bible.

According the Josephus, a non-Christian (Jewish) historian, James was killed for religious reasons:<br>  <br>  "Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the ***Sanhedrim of judges***, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned...

I know you are concerned that you will stir things up, and hey, he could just be fooling around. But this is about your feelings not his. or anyone else for that matter. Here's what I suggest, what ever school official who deals with this, counselor, teacher, you need to tell them about this, and that at this time you don't want to act on it, but you must document it, if it happens again or gets worse you will have a history of the behavior. protect yourself, Be well. carol

2SKd9996aa	I think a person committing suicide is probably not thinking too much about where he or she is going afterward. A believer will probably beg for forgiveness before doing it. The Bible actually does not state anywhere within what will happen if a person commits suicide. People make their own interpretations, of course, but in actuality, only God knows. It is His decision and I would bet that there are a lot of factors besides the suicide that go into the decision. A person's mental health state, for one.<br>    My dad killed himself in 1997 and I don't think he thought rationally about what would happen to him afterward. He was Christian.<br>  <br>  ETA my dad was bi polar and had just been put on Prozac the week before which has been linked to suicide|`|61a1bb75a10bf426d979acfca18b8d63aa	Anyone considering suicide is not intelligent. They are messed up.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Let me ask you a question : A man takes an illegal drug a few times, knowing its wrong and then gets hooked and says " I sure didn't want this" Therefore there could not have been enough proof to the druggie that god or his rules was real or true.<br>  <br>  The last step is often the punishment and the first steps are the culpable ones.|`|AA11008046	I believe that people in that state have come to a point where they do not stop to consider the outcome.  It is more important to them to end their current misery without considering the outcome of future torment.  I would suppose that any one who has become so disheartened to take their own life has really not considered even theo hurt is causes their loved ones that are left to deal with their decision.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	There is no hellfire.(Jeremiah 7:31) And they have built the high places of To′pheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hin′nom, in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.’<br>  <br>  However none of us can read the heart or understand the mind of another,only God can do that.Thus we cannot be the judge.<br>  We have to remember that some people are just sick and they can't get a grip. I know people who have commited suicide who truly believed in God with all their heart,but because of depression that they could not control the imbalance they had lived under all their lives they committed suicide.Sometimes drinking or drugs lead to that.What is so scary about suicide is that it happens in an instant of thought. Most suicides have happened within 5 minutes of time almost instantly it pops in the head and the person commits it.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Murderers will face judgement.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	they are too depressed to care at the time but hell is graves anyway....UNbelievers will face judgment..|`|yAoldffKaa	Well you have to see from their point of view that the reason people kill themselves is either to rid them selves of pain (thinking there is no life to this) or just punishing themselves. They think they won't get a second chance whether they did something really bad or are just so depressed and have low self esteem. <br>  <br>  Some people can kill themselves knowing that their gonna go to hell like oh 'I don't belong here might as well just get it over with.' You can think some pretty crazy things when you've gone suicidal.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	When someone is about to commit suicide these sort of thoughts do not enter their head.<br>  <br>  They are way beyond caring what happens to them after they are dead.  All they know is that they can't bear being alive for a moment longer and they want to stop the mental anguish whatever the cost.<br>  <br>  I worked on a Suicide Helpline and have spoken to hundred of these people over the years.   Not one of them ever mentioned anything remotely religious.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i think people who committed suicide were being selfish, honestly. and thinking very short-term. when i say "thinking short-term," i don't mean not considering that there might be life after this one, i'm thinking that their life on earth might have improved, but they cut it short before it had an opportunity to. anyway, if they were frustrated enough to commit suicide, i highly doubt they cared what was next.|`|ki8kdpJPaa	Most people who kill themselves are in their own personal "hell", for a Christian to WISH or ASSERT that these people go to hell is immoral and disgusting. <br>  <br>  Walk in the shoes of a person who is bipolar or depressed.

True Christians are just as fallible and subject to the depressions that lead to suicide as any other mortal... however... those of The True Church(all those of The True Christian Faith) will enter Heaven regardless of how they leave this mortal world.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I don't know.  I do know God would forgive the saved person who committed suicide and welcome them into Heaven. I think people who kill themselves are so lost they don't which end is up,|`|LLey4VRzaa	Try it then get back to us and tell us how it went?|`|AA11124121	they don't think that far ahead...|`|77mwgDnZaa	well when you commit suicide you're already in a type of personal hell that makes you come to that decision.  So even if it's just for a brief second that this pain would subside then this would satisfy the suicider regardless of whatever comes next.  <br>  <br>  I personally believe that they don't enter the kingdom of God, therefore, face eternal hell.|`|52ufT5lSaa	I do not believe suiciders believe in a hell at that point. They may think that life is so bad that their is no God. If they are killing themselves they are not thinking clearly to begin with. They are not thinking of heaven or hell.|`|ardo26GOaa	I think people just get to the end of their rope...(God always gives us a way out..)  and they just don't care what the judgement is going to be.  Personally I have a hard time concluding which eternity suicide leads to if you're saved.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	When some one commits suicide they are not in a state of mind they are confused . So they are not accountable before God for taking there life.|`|fnytzXWTaa	I'm Catholic I think, they don't think to far ahead to really be thinking about God.

e5VUwaRsaa	An affair would imply a physical and/or emotional relationship with someone else. Adultery could be either. <br>  <br>  I suggest you leave her. But I know it's easier said than done.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	So sorry to hear that.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's adultery and a marital affair.|`|7J9Eb3VCaa	Yeah kissing can happen for multiple reasons but none the less it hurts to see it whether it was for fun or whatever. It also depends on where you saw it or how you got a hold of it. If it was posted somewhere surely she isn't that afraid of you finding it so there has to be an explanation. Now if it was somehow hidden and it took some snooping to find it there may be a problem. People have affairs for many reasons. Not saying there is an excuse for someone you love to hurt you in anyway whether it be as simple as a kiss, there may be a good explanation. To know what your next step will be confrontation is needed. By doing so you can tell a lot about the situation for example if she gets really defensive she has done something wrong no one wants to admit a fault. Good luck I'm sorry you have this added stress especially since you're deployed and have enough to worry about. Getting things out in the open relieves a lot of stress and maybe can aid in some closure.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	I'm sorry to hear that, but a picture is just a picture.  It's not proof of anything.  For example, it may have been taken before you two were married. Or the kiss may have had no meaning other than friendship.  <br>  <br>  You need to talk to her about it without accusing her of anything right away.  Just ask when the picture was taken.  She'll understand why you're asking and hopefully will have a good excuse (like, it was her bachelorette party). <br>  <br>  But if she is two timing you, then there will be other evidence, like friends will have seen her out with some guy holding hands or something.  Or someone saw a guy enter your home and not leave until the next morning.  Get some good evidence before you express suspicions.<br>  <br>  Even if you find out she's unfaithful, I advise caution.  Some women aren't cut out to be military wives.   If she's miserable and reaching out to random men now, then maybe she just needs to be let go.  Don't make the bad situation worse by recriminations.  You knew very well that you were taking a risk marrying and then being away for long periods.  If trust has broken down, then just walk away peacefully.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	If you view it as adultery and she knows you would view  it as adultery then it is adultery. Unless the person is her brother or her gay friend, it is inappropriate. Furthermore, your gut instinct is correct. Do you feel there is more? Adultery can be emotional or physical, but it is still adultery.|`|AA10034285	No. Of course not. Kissing someone on the lips can happen any time, any where, on any occasion, and is certainly not grounds for your suspicions or anything else for that matter.<br>  <br>  Don't you think you are being just a little bit paranoid, and is that because you yourself have not always been faithful?|`|Qd1fPDMgaa	Do you know who is that other person?? She might have been tricked to get that picture taken?? She is your wife and you have every right to sit down and discuss this with her. I guess before jumping onto any conclusion please have a one-on-one conversation.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	It could be.  Normally the "affair" involves sex.  The picture could imply that a sexual relationship exists, but is not concrete proof.  Hire a private detective to follow her, then you will have your proof.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	Both. It is one and the same.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	You should be filing for divorce as we speak!
6lMFrqBgaa	Depends on who you ask :)<br>  <br>  Now that is a question that's somewhat difficult to answer, as there is no one right answer. Many sources offer different answers, and depending on the source, there are 189, 191, 192, 193, 194 or 195 independent countries in the world today. <br>  <br>   As of May 1, 2008, the United Nations has 192 members (including Montenegro and Serbia - the two newest nations). That number does not include the Vatican, and it doesn't (yet) include Kosovo (disclaimer). <br>  <br>   Regarding England, Scotland and Wales, though all are widely considered individual countries, they are all still a part of the United Kingdom (UK), a European country, and therefore included within the United Kingdom on our country list below. <br>  <br>   The US State Department recognizes 194 independent countries around the world, but that list of countries reflects the political agenda of the United States of America. As an example, it includes Kosovo, but does not include Taiwan, as China claims that Taiwan (the ROC) is simply a province of China. <br>  <br>   Most of the current World Almanacs use 193 countries, which is probably the best answer, but what about Kosovo? (disclaimer) Palestine? Greenland? Western Sahara? The political world is constantly changing and our list of independent nations is shown below. Note that we don't say that our list is the ONLY answer, just that it's our answer.|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Not to sure but i think it's a little shy of 200???|`|MRtX1L2faa	alot|`|MnTvROkmaa	there are 193 recognised countries by really there are 194

ZFllYTlpaa	Simon was a fisherman. His brother Andrew said to him, "I have met Jesus. Come and see Him." Simon loved Jesus.  Jesus gave him the name Peter, which means " rock."  Jesus picked eleven other Apostles and said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men." He meant that He would send them to do His work of bringing people to God. The Apostles gave up their homes to follow Jesus. <br>  One day Jesus said to them, "Who do you think I am?" Peter answered, "You are Christ, the Son of God." <br>  Our Lord was pleased and said, "You are Peter, a rock, and I will build My church upon you. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven." This is the power to help people get to heaven. <br>  <br>  After His Resurrection, Jesus asked Peter three times, "Peter, do you love Me?" Three times Peter answered, "Lord, You know that I love You." And Jesus said to him, "Feed My lambs, feed My sheep." In this way Jesus made it clear that Peter was to be the first pope. <br>  <br>  Peter was crucified in Rome, head downward, because he said he was not worthy to die the same way as Jesus.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Some times i want to just sit and shake my head in wonderment of how some thing that is so obvious is so hard to accept. I think part of the problem is they refuse to except what the first Christians after the Apostles wrote and believed and another they can not understand there was no New Testament then and already within the first few yrs of Christianity there were many different groups teaching a different Gospel and producing letters they claimed the Apostles wrote i suspect to give credence to there teachings and you can read in the Epistles here Paul is already warning people about such going on's such as where he says unless you hear it from us. So it took the Church 300 yrs to finally hold a council to sort through all the hundreds of letters and so called Gospel letters to decide which were authentic.As for example the Arian Heresy was about to take over the Church and Constantine ordered a council to settle the issue and that is why to this day the Nicene creed is what professes what the True Church believes and Teaches all this done before the New Testament was settled.I know this is long but hope some one reads this and gets a better picture of the early yrs of Christianity.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	John 21:15 - in front of the apostles, Jesus asks Peter if he loves Jesus "more than these," which refers to the other apostles. Peter is the head of the apostolic see. <br>  <br>  John 21:15-17 - Jesus charges Peter to "feed my lambs," "tend my sheep," "feed my sheep." Sheep means all people, even the apostles.|`|pakIAYWoaa	Peter truly was awsome man of faith...Jesus called manyh to follow him and had many disciples but chose 12 to be apostles.  The call is not to Peter but to everyman.  Jesus desires us all to walk in the same fullness that Peter walked in.  Peters commission is the same to every Christian.l  The place where Catholics make him pope is when Jesus asked who do you say that I am? Peter answered you are the Christ the Son of the living God..Peter's name meant little pebble, Jesus said blessed are you Peter for flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my Father in heaven. Upon this rock ( large substancial rock) I will build my church.  So the choice is the statement Jesus is the Christ the son of the living God as the foundation of the church or Peter...Peter in his epistle call us a royal and holly priesthood and refers to Jesus as the rock...Isaiah says there is no other rock but God so Peter rocks there was never to be a pope.. In revelation it talks about the deeds of the Nicolaitains, this is where the clergy is raised up above the lay people and God said he hates it.

There are a lot of youth groups, especially if you live in the city.  Make some friends at PFLAG so they can set you up with their family members (you'd be perfect for my sister!).  Myspace may help you.  You can do the kind of advanced searches you find on most dating sites: filter for bi/lesbian girls, age group, religion, smoking/non, interests, location, single, want/don't want kids etc.  They wouldn't be there if they didn't want to make friends!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Because most racist like you say that black people were a an evoultion from monkeys and some German propoganda racist scientist back in the day have all you people thinking so even when a certain time when individuals discovered that black people are actually human.But some still believe black people orginated from monkeys,apes,etc.<br>  Just to learn something new for you(it's so obvious):<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_zoo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_zoo</a>|`|OWfU0OdLaa	It wasn't racist, one bit.

But Sharpton and all his "followers" saw this as a golden opportunity to play the race card like they always do. Blacks will always do this, and white will always be the racist ones.

Anyway, I am white and I am sick of white people playing what I have dubbed "the crying white victim", look at congress and tell me it doesn't look like a sea of white sauce, 95% of the senior management positions are white men, the wealthy and powerful are overwhelmingly white, throughout this country's history white people have gotten some pretty good treatment I think we can agree, this lead to the "old boy networks" and affiliations that many white people have today. Now let's take a look at what black people face, of those incarcerated 44% are black even though they are only 12% of the population and commit crimes at similar rates to whites. In fact, the United States incarcerates black men at higher rates than apartheid South Africa. They make 62% of median white income, they go to schools that are WAY underfunded, they live in constant fear of being shot by police because their toothpick looks like a gun, they are less likely to get loans from banks, and they have been psychologically damaged after 400 years of oppression. To answer your question, it can be taken as racist because the connection of black people to monkeys is something that white racists have been doing for a long time, but I didn't take it as racist, I just thought he made a statement that could have been taken as racist, I'm not sure he mean. This is another reason why diversity is needed, if there was a black man working at the Post, he could have said "Maybe we shouldn't print this..."|`|06Rlukp7aa	Oh, I agree there is a huge double standard on this issue. It is ridiculous, the fact that no one dared offer criticism of Obama during his campaign, or questioned the fact that he is "black", he is half white and possibly part Arabic, but we fawn over the 1st black president. Voting for someone because of their skin color is just as bad as voting against them because of their skin color. I know a lot of people openly "fawned over and even voted for Obama" because he is black, that is sad!  Just as bad as voting against him because he is black.|`|V7MYYe7Jaa	The reason is obvious, from the day when the black people were brought to America in chains they were considered different so they were also treated differently than any other human being here on earth. That in turn made the blacks a target for racism, and from that day until the present they had to endure racism from the ones who are racist. So to answer your question that cartoon denotes racism.|`|DHiqm9Ojaa	I could see why you would be upset about this but the reason for that is because blacks were in slavery for a long time and that is still on some peoples minds. I personally think that you shouldn't get too mad at her because...wait before I say this I should let you know that this is the truth and you'll see if you look around, but as I was saying, you shouldn't get mad at her because you don't see too many blacks in school, honestly, and she might be a little upset about it. For example, I'm black as you can see, and in my school, there are about 2,500 people, but out of all those people only 50 of them are black. Can you beleive that! It gets me kinda mad because you'd think with this segregation problem fixed a long time ago, there would be more. ;(|`|8lNWNxmQaa	Lol, someone *just* said this on the radio.

5anP962Yaa	Saying that something is a "rottura di scatole" means that this thing gets on your nerves.    If a person is a "rompiscatole" (litteraly someone who breaks boxes) means that this person pisses you off, he/she is a "pain in the a rse"    If you tell someone "Non rompermi le scatole" you are not asking him/her "not to break your boxes", but rather you are asking to "don't disturb you" in an impolite way (although there are harsher expressions to say that and the word "scatole" is replaced by the male sexual organ...)

jfcrxSSBaa	 - Ashiri Baputisuto (-san)  Her name cannot be transcribed exactly in Japanese, as they go more by the syllable, and not the letter.  The honorific -san is the standard, but it is never used when referring to oneself.  You would say "Hello, Ashiri-san", but never, "My name is Ashiri Baputisuto-san"  The Japanese normally use their last name first (which is the name they are normally referred to as, unless very familiar), but with English names, they use our standard first then last names as an order, and use the last name + san to address you (again, unless familiar).    As far as the other honorifics, it would all depend on who they are talking to, their position and status with that person, and their title.    -San is the standard, and applicable to just about anyone.  -Chan is the very familiar honorific, reserved for close friends and family.   -Sensei  is what is used to address a teacher or mentor.  - kohai  is a younger, less experienced student. Conversely, the senpai is the more senior, experienced student.  There is a strict code of respect between the kohai and senpai, where the kohai always uses respectful tones and language with their superior, and offers to do things like carry their bags, etc.  The senpai, in turn mentors and offers advice to the kohai.  This system is governed by mibun, a set of rules governing rights and responsibilities.     There are a myriad of honorifics out there, so it would all depend on the situation.    Most likely, if you are her close friend, you would refer to her as  (Ashiri-chan),  (Ashi-chan), or ( (Ashu-chan)    Hope this helps!|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	It would be Ashu-chan (they don't just end with -sh so they add a u). The suffixes are called honorifics. It's similar to Mr., Mrs., and Ms. but they don't mean the same. "-san" means someone you respect, of higher authority, or someone you're not close to. "-chan" is for girls that are younger than you or that you are very close to. If you called a man this, you better watch out! It's an insult unless you are very close to them. It's also used for young children, someone significantly younger than you or of lower ranking, and for pets. "-kun" is for young men, men that are younger than you, or a subordinate. "-sama" is for someone of great respect like a boss or someone you idolize. "-sempai" is for teachers, someone you're learning under (like a tutor or an upperclassmen), or someone of a professional trade (such as a doctor though you'd usually call him "-san"). "-dono" is a feudal term that litterally means "lord". I think that's pretty self-explanatory.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Just google "get a japanese name" or something like that.

bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, you can mix the two, by saying evolution is the hand of God in creation.  You need not believe that God created creatures with a snap of the fingers, but rather he might guide their evolution as they change from one form to the next and go from one to many over thousands of years.  After all God is an immortal being, a million years of evolution to God may be like a blink of the eye, so creation is instantaneous from his perspective.    Genesis says he created the Earth in six days. But we do not need to take that literally. Before mankind was created, what was a "day" to God? A billion years? The human mind would measure time differently from an immortal one.|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

This is generally referred to as theistic evolution.|`|QVFx895Caa	No,  Darwin's evolution is not Bible are fact, it is a false belief of non life came by chance, over a long pirate of time witch came by a big bang theory witch also came about from nothing. All make believe, no science logic, no truth. Quoting from a evolutionist, - If you tell a lie often enough people will begin to believe you, and the bigger the lie the most likely they will believe you. Adolf Hitler.|`|Lr8QxBTnaa	And why not? I mean, we have found the answers to lots of questions, how men appeared, how animals evoluted, even how the universe appeared! But do u notice they're just "how"? We may now how babies get born, but why?! I mean, u have to be a little phylosophic on this one, perhaps if there wasnt God all those things may not have ever happened! Perhaps we know how the athoms get toghethes in molecules, but we don't know why precisely, we know how the heart works, not why it starts to beat! It's all a matter of in what uy're ready to believe in and are u going to hide behind the sience and to think that every matter has it's explainaition.   Another example - even the pope, though i'm not catolic, but the other kind of christianity, i dunno how is it in english, but even he said that alience could exist and that "it's not their fault that they could not get to know who God is and that they were too far away to be touched by it's bless" and on and on. It could all be in a perfect harmony!  And somethiing more - in the bible there are only a few, four i believe, hmm, book? I dunno the english words, but not all Gospels \is it right?\ are used in it, most of them have been hidden, destroyed, denied and we found them just nowadays. We can say, that a lot of the religions have been created in a way, so they could fit the times, they were in. And it doesnt mean they arent true and there istn god just because something isnt said in the bible, there are a lot of new facts on this question and it deppends on how much u believe in god himself and how much - to words, that could have been changed and manipulated during the years.   Still we should not believe to anything, but as i said - it could all be in harmony. I could say much more on this question, but I believe i wont have enough space XD|`|WZsP5Xcbaa	Yes.  Evolution is observable in small increments.  I look at it as God's way of giving living creatures the ability to adapt to an environment and survive.  This does not mean that I simple swallow everything that comes out of the "theory of Evolution" as is presented by Darwin.  You just need to pull the meat away from the bone.  Scientist's reasoning for the origin of the Earth and living things is always changing, because they simply do not know.  For those of us who have faith in God, we do ultimately know where everything came from in the big picture, but I don't think we'll ever know all of the details in this life time.  It's better not to get caught up on such debates.  They ultimately lead us no where.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Con-fusion. Great...|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Biological evolution can and does happen - changes within species are part of the capacity to adapt that God has given them.  But in terms of the general theory of evolution, the two cannot both be true.  A person certainly could not accept the Bible but also believe that all species evolved from a single source.|`|37LKDbtsaa	If you take Genesis as an allegory, yes.    It's only American fundamentalists, who are in denial.|`|qnt1wAfiaa	Yes, it can. There are a vast number of Christians that accept evolution. Even the last pope (John Paul 2nd) came out with something that said it is possible to accept evolution.     There are forms of Christianity that do not coincide, such as the ones that promote 'Young Earth Creationism'.  Mainstream Christianity generally does not have a conflict though.|`|c345a0234bc2cff30d382612a53c4eb9aa	I stopped answering this SAME QUESTION a long time ago because I always get slammed from both sides (especially the fundies)--but yes, as a Christian, I do believe they can, absolutely.    For one, the Bible says that God created the world in six days. But what is a "day" to God? A billion years? 10 billion?    It doesn't say HOW God created fish, birds, and people. I just says that he did. So. . . why can't those methods be proved by science, as they are? The evidence is too great, we continually find skeletons of animals that do not exist anymore, and the metamorphasis of species on-going today.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Pope and the Catholic church accept evolution!!

Its documented in the bible that very large animals much bigger than elephants lived amongst us called Leviathans and so on..|`|89MKzLl3aa	Yes, but remember, unlike science, faith can't be measured and theorized. One can take Genesis literally as the Word of God, and consider the possibility that much of it is allegorical.    By thinking this way, one can think with reason regarding science and believe evidence means truth, and at the same time consider all in faith to be plausible without compromising your beliefs.    This may be hard to understand, but if you think long enough, you will see that there isn't a reason not to live by faith and natural truth in harmony.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Well, you'd pretty much have to admit the first five chapters of Genesis were fantasy.|`|283tO9j9aa	Yes, they can go together. Most Christian denominations and the people who are part of them accept evolution, at least they do outside of the United States. The Catholics accept it, and the Church of England obviously never had a major problem, because Charles Darwin is buried in Westminster Abbey. Unless you take the Genesis account literally, there is no reason to reject evolution- after all, it just explains a mechanism for diversity and says nothing about origins so there is plenty of room for a god if you believe in one.    Evolution seems very plausible because it is! It has a lot of evidence and although it turned out to be more complex than Darwin could have imagined the basics are still in place. It's a very good scientific theory (remember that's different from the everyday use of theory). For everyday life we can consider it fact, because there is so much stuff which supports it.    Personally I don't believe in any gods but there's no reason to reject either your god or good science because of the other one of the two.|`|vxSXsn59aa	Millions of your fellow christians, even including the Pope, seem to think that they can coexist just fine. It's only a tiny, though disproportionately vocal, minority within your faith who reject the concept of evolution. The only thing that a christian has to give up to accept evolution, is a strictly literal interpretation of Genesis, which biblical scholars agree was not meant to be taken literally anyway. Like so much of the bible, it's allegorical.|`|GGUDvicaaa	Yes, they can. Here in Europe most Christians accept evolution as scientific fact which it is. Evolution is science, not theology.|`|KT7cllsLaa	Evolution  is in direct opposition with any form of divinity)deity|`|VNrchvUNaa	"I do believe in God, but evolution seems very plausible."  Wow, you're confused.    Evolution is not only highly probable - it happened and is still happening. It's a fact.    God is highly improbable and most likely does not exist.|`|XAbWoNiRaa	not really.    You can adopt a Prime Mover position, saying God got the ball rolling and then sat back and watched but it defeats the view of a Biblical God that intervenes in human affairs, has a plan etc.  You are then just a deist, which is not how Christians view their god.    True, evolution says nothing about how life got started, I'm just saying traditionally, Christians do not see their God as a scientist watching his subjects in a lab, waiting to see what will surface from the grand experiment.|`|iX0CoNkXaa	No    Evolution is a flawed science but Gods science is perfect.    Theistic evolution teaches God is not in control.    The only evolution that has proof is evolution within a species but not from one species to another.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Yes, they can.  We do not know how long God's days are.  Perhaps they were 24 hours, like ours.  Or perhaps they were each a thousand years.  It is not ours to know.  As long as we know and believe that God created it all, in whatever time, in whatever form, that is all we need.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	Yes, if you assume that the timeline in the creation story is separate from the time line we're on, like a second dimension of time.|`|XN0cYCATaa	No, What You are talking about is Called Theistic Evolution    A variation on the theme of evolution is theistic evolution. It states that God initiated life on earth and allowed evolutionary principles to bring man to where he is--maybe with a little help from God here and there. At least this theory includes God. But this theory was developed in part by Bible believing people who thought that evolution had some merit. In addition, it is an attempt to answer the many problems existing not only in the fossil record but also with how life could somehow randomly form out of nothing. Because of problems like this, some believe they can be explained by simply adding God to the picture: God directed evolution.         For those who hold to the Bible as the word of God, theistic evolution should not be a viable option. The Bible says, "Know that the LORD is God. It is he who made us..." (Psalm 100:3). The Scriptures state that God created. God said, "Let there be..." and there was. The Scriptures speak of the creative word of God. When God speaks; it occurs. He said "Let there be" and it was so. It does not say, "Let there be a slow development through an evolutionary process."         God said in Genesis 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground." The Hebrew word for "make" in this verse and in verse 25 where God makes the beasts, is "asah." It means to do, work, make, produce. This is not simply the limited Hebrew understanding of evolutionary principles.         The land animals were made differently than man. The animals were made from the ground but man was made directly by God: "the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being" (Gen. 2:7). Evolution states that man evolved from life forms that developed in the ocean. Here, God made man from the dust of the ground--not the water of the ocean.         If evolution is true and the Bible is true then how is the formation of Eve explained? She was created out of one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:22). There is no way to explain this if theistic evolution is true; that is, unless you want to say that Eve wasn't made from Adam's side. Then, if you do that, you are doubting the very word of God.         Also, Jesus said in Mark 10:6 "But at the beginning of creation God made them male and female.'" The beginning was not evolutionary slime; in the beginning of creation there was Adam and Eve.         Though this information is brief and far from complete, it should be obvious that theistic evolution and the Scriptures cannot be harmonized.

It's a possibility.  But it does seem more likely that evolution is responsible for the creation of man too.|`|7cLYgf2raa	Evolution and christianism may be about to coincide. But Christianity, belief if the creation of Genesis, cannot believe that God took millions of years to create anything. To believe that God made millions of changes till he got it right, then do away with any evidence of those changes is ludicrous.    To believe in evolution you would have to do away with all the faith scriptures in the bible. Since God spoke faith words and created all things. Then Jesus came and proved that things will still respond to faith by speaking to the wind and the storm and trees.Ignorance of God's word is the only thing that can open the door to believeing in evolution.|`|cJCRc8kfaa	There is a big difference between microevulution, adaptation, and change over time, versus, "we came from primates..."

It's only the less mature churches in the 'bible belt' of the US that oppose evolution - and do so from what would be considered elsewhere to be a particularly naive theological position; a position from which the more developed faiths departed quite some time ago.    But of course, to accept such natural explanations for natural phenomena does always push the concept of god further and yet further into the narrowing gaps of science.

If you've been there a year or more you really have to leave on good terms (unfortunately).  Do what I do.  I write a letter saying every nasty thing I want.  I put it aside for a day or two.  Then I re-read the letter and throw it away.  It makes me feel better after I say what I want but no harm is done because I throw it away.  Good Luck|`|Tswfs7qGaa	Bottom line, it's a bad idea to burn bridges.  Just resign with a very classy professional letter.  Remember that future employers may call a past boss, and you don't want this guy to have any ammunition against you.    The best way to "get back at him" is to remember his behavior and avoiding making the same mistakes in the event you ever get to a position where you manage other people.|`|a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	i have a friend who has always given "appraisals" to his superiors whenever he left a job.  i can't see where it ever got him anywhere.    if you have to, then do it.  if you think it will make you feel better, it will for only a short time.  after that, it will just bother you again.    let it go, brother, and trust that God will bring it around to him.    read 2nd Chronicles 32:7 and 8 --    "Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that [is] with him: for [there be] more with us than with him:     With him [is] an arm of flesh; but with us [is] the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah."
LsUZbEEuaa	Ol, Kwaaikat! Como ests?    In portugus europeu, which is the variant spoken in Mo?ambique, one forms the progressive with ESTAR A + the infinitive of the verb, for example:    Estou a escrever esta resposta.  Ests a ver?  Est a chover.    In speech, the "a" of "est" will elide with the following "a"; therefore, one says/pronounces "estachover" for what is represented graphically as "Est a chover."    So, your friend and her parents are absolutely correct in their speech, and there is nothing odd about it. It is the standard in European Portuguese, which is correct for Portugal, Mo?ambique, Angola, Cabo Verde, et al.    What it is not is Brazilian Portuguese. That's what turned up in your internet search. And that is correct only for Brazil|`|CtkV1XuHaa	In the portuguese from Prtugal it's used to say " Est a chover". The present continous in the european portuguese is formed always by ESTAR VERB + A PREPOSICION + MAIN VERB|`|ZYEmhgbgaa	"Est chovendo" is Brazilian portuguese  "Est a chover" is Portugal portuguese =P    Both are correct of course, but they're used  in differente countries|`|f0da4a517ba6c6b58130dd41efd9fb9faa	As you've probably understood by now "esta+ gerund" is used in Brazil while "esta+a+infinitive" is used in European Portuguese (Portugal, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Angola, etc.) So your friend was in fact correct. My suggestion would be to become comfortable with both forms so you can understand and be understood by all Portuguese speakers.  Boa sorte cara!

6Whz1p5Eaa	Yeah, thats not gonna happen|`|AA12059478	Lol.<br>  No.  The only way to change your eye color is with contacts dearie.  You've seen the Craft too many times.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	If you're friend wants "easy" - then Wicca is not likely the right path for her.<br>  <br>  In just becoming Wiccan - she should be focusing on building a relationship with Goddess and God, learning Wiccan ethics, attuning to the seasons.  How about learning about the next upcoming Sabbat and how to honor it?  Magic is a secondary practice and not necessary to become Wiccan.<br>  <br>  The "change eye color" spell, if it works, would only give others the illusion that the person's eye color has changed, and it's only temporary.  It's rather a waste of magical energy. <br>  <br>  Wiccan ethics would teach one that spells are only used when there is a need, and all other mundane methods have been utilized as well.  Does this person *need* to change their eye color?  No.<br>  <br>  If she wants to learn magic, it's best to start at the beginning and learn the basic mechanics of magic before "trying" spells.  But if it's solely the spells your friend is interested in, that's not the religion of Wicca, and I have to agree with Gypsy's comment.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	What you SHOULD be looking for is a spell that would give you a brain.<br>  <br>  Then you could figure out for yourself that spells are a joke and don't work.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Do you realize that posting ridiculous questions like this has an impact on how non-Wiccans view Wicca?

Wiccans will make fun of you for asking things like this.|`|x8iAd7Znaa	aCID iN tHE eYES wOULD bE oNE!!!!|`|lv4GM0tEaa	Here are a couple of rituals that might help, one is a bit more elaborate than the other.<br>  <br>  ---Close your eyes. You must have complete focus and be concentrating only on changing the eye color, any other distractions must be cleared from the mind. Now fill your mind with the color your eyes are, right now, naturally. Now see that color slowly change to the color you wish your eyes to become. See it overpower your natural color. Imagine that the color shines like a ray of light from inside your mind out through your eyes. Visualize your eyes becoming that color as the light passes through them. (This process should take at least 15 minutes the first few times, and you will have to repeat it after awhile. Glamours fade as you "forget" them.)<br>  <br>  Upon opening your eyes, you may or may not be able to see the change in the mirror. For a more accurate check of whether it worked, ask someone what color your eyes are. If they know you really well they may see past the glamour. (Your parents may see past it, and often spouses or very close friends, because they know you too well.) The stronger you develop the talent to throw a glamour, the more people it can trick. It will take you practice.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---This spell requires candles. You will technically need three candles but, honestly, the more candles you have the better. The color of the candles isn't crucial but can help the spell move along. Try to obtain an orange candle, a pink candle, and one candle that is the same color that you want your eyes to change to. You will also need to get a pink rose, preferably fresh cut.<br>  <br>  Finding the right location for casting this spell will be important. Try and find a quiet and slightly dark room in your home. It will be best if you are comfortable in the room with your mind free of any distractions. Set up the candles all around you, having the main three close to you. You don't have to light them right away. Place the rose near where you are sitting. Be sure you are very comfortable and totally relaxed..<br>  <br>  With the rose and the candles in front of you, you can begin your first chant. Some people practicing magic may leave this chant out and use other methods. You have to decide what is the most accurate for you. Hold one hand over the rose and one over the candle colored the same as your desired eye color. Begin to say, "This is to touch (touch the rose with your hand), this is to be (put your hand over the candle), Shape and ferment for all to see, by the powers of three times three (Put your hands over your eyes), as I will it, so shall it be."<br>  <br>  Light the candles as soon as you are through with the statement. Light each slowly, while remaining relaxed. Then you will need to chant at least three times, "One, Two, Three change for me, one, two, three (present eye color), and one, two, three (color you wish to have). After this you will only have two more steps to complete before your eye color will be changed. You will next have to chant, "By the powers of three let it be seen." You should chant this at least three times. They can be repeated more, especially if you are just starting out and need more time to focus your energies.<br>  <br>  After the candle lighting and chanting, you will need to fall into an even deeper state of relaxation than you were in before. Settle into a very comfortable position and close your eyes. Hold them closed and begin to visualize the current color of your eyes. Follow this after a few moments by visualizing the color you want them to change to. Picture them changing within your mind. This visualization is extremely important. You should be able to sense how long you need to do this. Then you may turn on the lights and check in a mirror. Some people feel that over time they can perform this spell with only the visualization.<br>  <br>  Have fun.

de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You can get headphones or move where you sit. She is deaf for life. The requirement est by the ADA is in no way bullshit as you so charmingly put it. She is pleasant, as you admit, and therefore she is way out in front as co workers go and I know because out of the many I have worked with over the years, I take a pleasant deaf lady ANY day over some of the freaks and monsters I have had to deal with in the past either by quitting or ignoring. Your attitude reminds me of a long ago day when I had lunch with my father and brother when I was 10 and my brother was 13 and he had just broken out in acne and this woman came over to our table and stood there yelling at my father for bringing my brother into a restaurant with his skin in that condition (and yelling all this with my brother sitting right there) and how it destroyed her appetite and she could not eat her lunch after she saw him. My father calmly put down his fork, looked at her and said "My son's face will clear up and he'll be very handsome (which turned out to be true) but you will be ugly all your life." She stood there for a few seconds then left without another word.<br>  You will also be ugly all your life.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Perhaps they referred to her as someone who is a "minor distraction" or "takes some getting used to" because unlike your lucky a$s she was born w/a birth defect, therefore, her sounding like that is nothing of which she has control over you phukin jerk-off!

Then when she tries to actually speak to you, you can sign that you need signing practice and prefer that she "speak" to you with her hands.  You, of course, will need to learn sign language but it might be fun (and it is another language).  Otherwise, you really cannot do anything without getting possibly bringing on an harassment suit or getting fired.  She's doing the best she can; if you've never heard human speech, all you can do is try to figure out how sounds are made by feeling them and making similar sounds in yourself.  You miss all the nuances and inflections and other things that go into human speech.|`|mQZDizMVaa	Understand something: Any one of us could become disabled/deaf in less time than it took to write this-and that includes you.<br>  <br>  Did you say ".....meet some bullshit requirement established by the ADA?" Be very careful of those words. I don't wish it on you or someone in your family - but you could end up disabled and what do you know? You yourself could go under the same ADA.<br>  <br>  I won't add much more, as much has been said here already. But you need to realize that sometimes Fate has a very, very strange way of dealing Her cards. "There But For The Grace Of God Go I."<br>  <br>  Free Your Mind.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Learn international sign language and she'll be able to communicate with you as she would any other person.  You're being ridiculously prejudiced in this whole thing.  Try being proactive and fixing your issues rather than bitching about them.  Oh, and she wouldn't have been hired over another more suitable candidate, equalities act or not. That act states that disabled people can't be passed over for their disability, but they won't get the job over a more qualified candidate.  She earned her job.  It also sounds to me like your co-workers are trying to find a polite way to get yo out of their faces with their responses to your ranting.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	How dare you say that when she talks it sounds like "she's gargling a mixture of saliva and tar as she attempts to form words".

Ugh!|`|4z1gryIGaa	That is one of the most insensitive, idiotic comment I have ever heard. If you can walk/speak/hear/comprehend..etc. You are blessed. You or I have no idea what that woman has been through. I think it's a beautiful thing that the disabilities act exists. What we should just lock them up so you won't have to look as she tries to form words?!! You are a real class act! Your the one incompetent.

But coming here and letting it out is a good way to obtain feedback.<br>  The disabilities act was a good idea, however, I'm not sure they thought it through. <br>  <br>  You have to remember this person has taken a big step in order to take care of herself and I commend her for that!<br>  <br>  You might want to try ear plugs. Or if you see her coming your way, put some headphones on so she won't be encouraged. <br>  <br>  You may want to see if you can be moved within your office. <br>  <br>  And lastl, you just may need to look elsewhere. But jobs are few and far in between now, so be sure you have another one before you quit. <br>  <br>  Start building on your resume. You'll need to figure out an answer for why you left this job. You don't want to share this with a potential employer.<br>  Best wishes
7aK81hsbaa	we told you in the beginning to stop calling him a "tranny" because it's offensive. don't you understand that? why do you continue posting this?<br>  enough already. find a new word.|`|Ao52XHjCaa	I'm going to say yes to the homeschooling for awhile at this point since this kid's life is a out of control at the moment. But the question I have is why is she calling a teenager for advice on this matter when she is the parent? She should be talking to other parents.<br>  <br>  The problem with the homeschooling is that any support mechanism that your school system provides for at risk kids will be taken away. Beyond the stress of constant bullying, the kid needs quite a few other resources that may not exist for him outside of school, and that concerns me a great deal. Especially if his mother is so socially isolated or emotionally distraught that she reaches out to you, who she barely knows, and who is not a parent, for advice.<br>  <br>  I'm still very concerned about the breakdown she had two days ago when you went over to her house to apologize and the kid's breakdown at your place when he talked about suicide. That suicide issue, as well as the cutting needs to be addressed somehow as it represents a problem that won't simply be solved by becoming friends with someone or taking him away from bullying for awhile. The best thing you can do right now is find adult resources for the kid to help him, and now I think you need to worth with the mother to find resources, too.<br>  <br>  While I hope you keep coming here, I hope you are talking to your parents about this, and if for some reason you can not, another adult. This is not the sort of burden that you should be taking on thinking that you can solve it with Y!A Q&As. You need someone closer to the ground.|`|EBt6Wbqpaa	don't feel bad, its natural to strike out at people who ignore good sense and insist in pushing the envelope, perhaps your lesson will  convince him to keep his habits at home and save his life before some person with a real axe to grind get to him.|`|K2SOMH6iaa	apoligizing might help, but what you did is unforgivable. jesus christ, like he didn't already have enough to deal with. you are sick.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Tell her the truth, about what you allowed to happen and how you feel about it.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	Hmm...

There is a lot in the Bible that is not true, and there is a lot in the Bible that is immoral.|`|tXdb3X4Kaa	Atheists can create their own morals. To have a moral, a person doesn't have to derive it from anything at all. One could be influenced by another person's morals, or from their parents, friends, family and/or teachers.

Stealing makes someone suffer, murder makes someone suffer, stoning unruly children makes the children suffer. So I don't get my morals from your bible or your God but from the common sense of not wanting to see my fellow man suffer.|`|v7Wflu78aa	People tend to model their behavior on how their parents treated them, and add to it the rules/ethics that they see around them.<br>  <br>  Children who are molested - no matter how religious they are - are far more likely to molest other children than atheists who have not been molested.<br>  <br>  In fact, the strength of one's morals (or the source) is like the color of the house - bad or good stuff can be going on inside no matter what it looks like from the outside.<br>  <br>  The  main difference is that religious people try to shape their morals (but maybe not their behavior - you never know) around some religious text or tradition, while atheists accept that they should behave in a way that is best for the society and themselves.|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Well you are sort of right. I do get my morals from IGNORING the bible.........the bible likes to kill people, destroy cities, kill newborns, sacrifice living animals, sacrifice your own son, cannibalism, send humans to some crazy eternal hell, demand worship because of my big ego, hate anyone and anything that goes against me, hate anything that has a brain, kill doctors and firemen for helping save people on the sabbath, ect...........................|`|aPuUuWlLaa	This has been asked and answered well so many times. Here's my answer I've given about a dozen times.<br>  <br>  "A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death." <br>  <br>  - Albert Einstein, "Religion and Science," New York Times Magazine, November 9, 1930 <br>  <br>  In short I get my morality from common sense as to the outcomes of certain life choices, social ties and repicrocal altruism, empathy, and upbringing. I think religion and gods are not necessary. I think one of the shortcomings or downsides of religion actually is it produces some people who think morality is only about doing what a god said and right and wrong are only so because of what a deity set forth. Think about it, if god said child rape was fine would it be? Wouldn't it still engender rage and the desire for retribution in parents and still harm the child? So is it wrong because of a god or religion or did we because of the outcomes associated realize its wrong but dress that in the trappings of a god's dictates and religion?|`|XqS5DxR9aa	You're hypothisizing that all atheists are immoral.

What's equally stupid is the fact that so many of you ignorant Jesus freaks have to learn your moral sense from a comic book that you idiots call a bible.|`|faT4MyVkaa	I am guessing you haven't really read the bible, especially the old testament.

It is unlawful to Islam. The Holy Quran condemns it by stating: “O’ you, who believe! Shun much suspicion for verily some suspicion is a crime. Would any of you like to eat of the flesh of his dead brother? But you abhor it. And keep your duty (to Allah). Lo! Allah is Relenting, Merciful.” 49:12<br>  <br>  Backbiting is when a person says mean things about others in their absence. This grave sin has likened to the eating of flesh of the dead body of a brother. It is an admitted fact that a Muslim is the brother of a Muslim and as such deserves his help and co-operation but a backbiter acts contrary to it. <br>  <br>  When a person is backbiting, the person being backbitten cannot defend himself because he himself is not there. For this reason, backbiting is strictly prohibited in Islam and one who is accustomed to this habit, shall not enter Paradise. (Muslim)<br>  <br>  SWEETHEART calm dowwwwwwwwwwn<br>  <br>  I seems you do not agree with what the QURAN says, so stOp your rant and go elsewhere YOU MAY BE SAYING IT OPENLY BUT IS HE IN YOUR PRESENCE NO!!!!!!!
yWhFoBBfaa	Honky was derived in the black community before the civil rights movement unfortunately many whites didn't want to be seen dating black women therefore they would honk the horn when they got to their dates house rather than ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door<br>  <br>  thus honky refers to honking the horn.|`|hexzaIGgaa	Honky, Honkey or Honkie is a predominantly American derogatory racial slur for white people.<br>  <br>  "Honky is a corruption of hungy or hunky, a term which originated in the stockyards and slaughterhouses of Chicago. The term may derive from "Bohunk" (Bohemian-Hungarian), which was used to refer to central Europeans. Black and Hungarian workers were two of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago meat industry. Racial and ethnic tension between the two groups led Black workers to begin calling Hungarian workers, and those perceived as Hungarians, hunky, perhaps in retaliation for the racist epithets to which blacks were subject. The corruption 'honky' emerged shortly thereafter."|`|rcCYssKYaa	Honky is the same as "n*gger" for whites.<br>  <br>  It came from the same place "n*gger" came from.

There are no mannerisms, music or clothing preferences that can define a person as gay.<br>  <br>  I play rugby, recently replaced the transmission on my truck alone, not a sharp dresser, can't dance, and is very proud to be gay.<br>  <br>  Just ask him if he has a girlfriend.

He will then see the shoe, and try to return it to you. That is only if he likes you. It will be much classier if you wear a pair of crystal high heel shoes. For the love of God, do not drop them. Crystal tends to shatter, and leave shards all over the place. Put the crystal shoe down lightly.

Opposition to God’s rightful Kingdom and its preachers unites the nations, and they are thus being gathered to “the war of the great day of God the Almighty” at Har–Magedon. That global “war” will mean total destruction for those faithless nations. This will signify the end of this system of things.—Revelation 16:14-16; Matthew 24:14.
EmOnt7FIaa	Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat things......<br>  <br>  If a single man is going to date a mother with multiple children, than he is probably a pedophile.

syIp6d2Naa	I used to spend as many nights on the dance floor as I could. It was so funny used to be a dance craze would start either on the east coast or the west and it would take a little bit of time to be accepted into the other coast's dances. Well that was the way it was when I was in the service. I learned "the Bump" before it hit the west coast so when I got home I started teaching all my friends. Well none of us were ever shy and we added a little dirty dancing into it and got ourselves kicked out of several of the girl's bars in one night. We finally went to one of the boy bars and they took to it like a duck takes to water and as dirty as we made it they made us look like Puritans. I'm not able to dance any more, I'm doing good to walk, I still miss it and rock out in my office chair to the oldies on "theRADIO.com" as I am right now. As far as why I used to dance, there was music on, and my feet started moving with no consultation with the brain to see if it was appropriate at the time or not.|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	everyone likes to if they are by themselves|`|Ji1DVABtaa	Never even occurred to me.|`|hZiwiboRaa	I dance when no-ones around.<br>  I feel so rebellious for some strange reason when i do it lol|`|2UUcuhHZaa	hi hydro ,listen i will answer ur e-mail later on ok,and as for this one oh hell yes i love to dance ,i doit when am happy i will dance sometimes when am sad ,but all in all i do dance the day an night away i some time do it in the shower but i have to be carefull not 2 fall lol lol lol lol lol  ,well i hope that this answered you ?,bye 4 now|`|YlMR42agaa	Do the D.A.N.C.E 12345 stick to the B.E.A.T get ready to ignite <br>  <br>  yes i luv to dance|`|po4j4xhAaa	I love to dance.

So you don't binge?  If so, then it's their right to try and help their daughter any way they can.|`|f6YsGOynaa	It depends... is your bulimia under control right now?  If part of the reason behind your financial issues that have you moving back home have to do with active bulimia, they are well within their rights.  <br>  <br>  If not, maybe you need to sit down with them and explain to them where you are in your recovery, and what kind of behaviors are inappropriate vs. what's appropriate.  Regardless of the fact that you are back under their roof, they still need to respect boundaries, since you ARE an adult.<br>  <br>  Let them know that you're working your recovery program, so they should let go of control a bit.  You can also let them know that a lot of the reason young women become bulimic is because of a lack of control over their own lives (mainly due to abuses by figures of authority, whether they be sexual/physical/emotional abuse, or just extreme pressure), and if they continue to exert that kind of control over you, it allows you (or pushes you into) losing control over the positive things in your life and causes you to control the only thing you can - your eating habits.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	It is there house.<br>  If you don't like it leave.|`|14zk9dldaa	1. Were they out of line?<br>  I'd say not. It IS their house. Are you paying rent? Then you aren't really in a position to dictate (key word is dictate) what they do as far as your room is concerned. You can ask them.<br>  2. Is it wrong of me to be p/o'd?<br>  Your feelings are your own and no one can say they are right or wrong.<br>  Would I have been p/o'd? Well, yeah!<br>  How p/o'd probably depends on if you are active in your behavior or not.<br>  I'm thinking/guessing you're not, b/c if you were, there wouldn't have been any "leftovers".  Could be or not.<br>  One thing I'd like to say is that food in your room isn't a great idea cause it can draw bugs. :(<br>  <br>  I'd probably want to sit down with them and get the rules. Are you or aren't you allowed to have food in your room? If this is something you want, then assure  them that you will keep only one or two things in there NO MORE (that's from me, lol) and that you will be sure to keep things air tight.<br>  Explain to them you want their trust, but (especailly after living away from them), their constant "going through your room" really aggravates you. Explain to them that feelings of anger only make you WANT to "act out", which is why you want to bring this out in the open. So, they can help you. <br>  <br>  Telll them if they have concerns about you're acting out, to "ask" you outright. You're not a little girl anymore. The healthy goal here is open communication.<br>  <br>  Now, here comes the hard part, <br>  As an adult, asking to be treated like an adult, you need to be prepared to answer them honestly when they DO ask you. And tell them that.<br>  One more thing, I'm assuming they do this when you are not home. <br>  Therefore, they are sneeking.<br>  However, they are asking you not to sneek.<br>  Same difference to me. (you might want to point that out) but if you do, don't do it in a "blaming" way. Do it matter of factly. You don't want them to become defensive, cause they will shut down and not "hear" you.<br>  Make an agreement not use sneeking behavior between the three of you.<br>  Sneaking is an unhealthy behavior. It's all a part of the disorder which is a cycle of disfunction in the family.<br>  <br>  The bottom line here is trust. That's a hard one. But it can be done. Begin to be healthy, all three of you.<br>  And remember, they love you very much.|`|a634fc83e8cc678200f372815e1d735daa	why would you keep a can of frosting in your room? maybe they were afraid of getting bugs or mice ..it comes down to you are an adult living in their home..so its their rules or you can move out..i don't see why they threw it out they could have just put it in the kitchen unless it was open and old...i honestly don't think its that big of a deal its a bag of chips..
NeTNnvSZaa	No it means that to forgive someone is to be like God (divine) and to hold a grudge is human.  In other words, you should rise above and forgive so you can be more like god.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The best is even better than that!!<br>  <br>  Treat a man as he appears to be, and you make him worse. But treat a man as if he were what he potentially could be, and you make him what he should be. -  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|`|xLKPKgZXaa	This is not a scriptural reference as far as I can see. If you think it is please give book, chapter and verse.<br>  <br>  However, the sentiment of the saying (which I think is man-made) means that only the Divine (God) can give total forgiveness. We, as individual human beings can forgive each other for various things but sins against humanity (mass murder for instance) and sins against God Himself (breaking God's laws) need His forgiveness. <br>  <br>  No-one can forgive quite like God does.  The bible tells us that God does not only forgive but He also forgets.  "He removes our sins from us as far as the east is from the west."  "He forgives our sins and remembers them no more"  Human beings do not forget and, even after saying that we have forgiven we sometimes still bear a grudge.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	The second.<br>  <br>  But it is quite possible to become special, or as Christ put it: Children of the Light." <br>  <br>  This will explain how an "easy yoke" can (over time) give a person the perfect quality of divine forgiveness. <a href="http://gospelenigma.com" rel="nofollow">http://gospelenigma.com</a> That resource explains the very neglected Kingdom Gospel that Christ himself was preaching.<br>  <br>  And thanks for this excellent question.|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	It presumably has reference to the fact that Christ has paid the penalty for sin thus perfectly satisfying Divine justice.<br>  <br>  Therefore only God can forgive without offending against the demands of Justice.<br>  <br>  Humans have all erred and offended against Justice.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	"To err is human, to forgive divine." is not a Biblical quote.<br>  <br>  It was a line in Alexander Pope's "An Essay on Criticism."|`|2ivrpXpeaa	You've obviously got mixed up with Alexander Pope and the bible but the real answer was at the convention celebrating the birthday of Spatz in Some like it hot!

AA10034051	Yes there is. After all praying the Rosary is praying the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost<br>  (Matt 28:19; cf. John 14:13-14; Acts 2:21)<br>  <br>  I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. [LUKE 1: 28; 1: 31-32] <br>  <br>  2nd Joyful Mystery The Visitation<br>  <br>  And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: “Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.” And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord. [LUKE 1: 42-45]<br>  <br>  3rd Joyful Mystery The Nativity<br>  <br>  And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days were accomplished, that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. [LUKE 2: 6-7]<br>  <br>  4th Joyful Mystery The Presentation<br>  <br>  And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord: As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord: And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.  [LUKE 2: 22-24]<br>  <br>  5th Joyful Mystery Finding Jesus in the Temple<br>  <br>  And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.  [LUKE 2: 46-47]<br>  <br>  1st Sorrowful Mystery The Agony in the Garden<br>  <br>  And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground. And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow. (Luke 22, 44-45) Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray. And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad. Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me. And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  [MATTHEW 26: 36-39] <br>  <br>  2nd Sorrowful Mystery Jesus is Scourged<br>  <br>  And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children. Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified. (Matthew 27, 25-26) But He was wounded for our iniquities, He was bruised for our sins: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His bruises we are healed. [ISAIAS 53: 5]<br>  <br>  3rd Sorrowful Mystery Jesus is Crowned with Thorns<br>  <br>  And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him. And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: “Hail, king of the Jews.” [MATTHEW 27: 28-29]<br>  <br>  4th Sorrowful Mystery Jesus Carries His Cross<br>  <br>  And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar. Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha. And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king. But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar. Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him forth. And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha. Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst. [JOHN. 19: 12-18]<br>  <br>  5th Sorrowful Mystery Jesus Dies on the Cross for our sins<br>  <br>  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” And saying this, he gave up the ghost. [LUKE. 23: 45-46]<br>  <br>  1st Glorious Mystery The Resurrection<br>  <br>  And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.  [MATTHEW 28: 5-6]<br>  <br>  2nd Glorious Mystery The Ascension of Christ into Heaven<br>  <br>  And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God. [MARK 16: 19] <br>  <br>  3rd Glorious Mystery Decent of the Holy Ghost<br>  <br>  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak. [ACTS 2: 2-4]<br>  <br>  4th Glorious Mystery Assumption of the Blessed Virgin<br>  <br>  And when she was come out to him, they all blessed her with one voice, saying: Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou art the joy of Israel, thou art the honour of our people: For thou hast done manfully, and thy heart has been strengthened, because thou hast loved chastity, and after thy husband hast not known any other: therefore also the hand of the Lord hath strengthened thee, and therefore thou shalt be blessed for ever. (Judith 15, 100-11) By faith Henoch was translated, that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had testimony that he pleased God. [HEBREWS 15: 10-11]<br>  <br>  5th Glorious Mystery Coronation of the Blessed Virgin<br>  <br>  And the temple of God was opened in heaven: and the ark of his testament was seen in his temple, and there were lightnings, and voices, and an earthquake, and great hail. And a great sign appeared in heaven: a Woman clothed with the sun, and the moon was under Her feet, and upon Her head a crown of twelve stars.

8G42oyydaa	I used to be, very frightening, I would wake up in the morning with clothing I put away the night before on the floor by the bed, once I had grass clippings on my feet and in the bed.  I know I had gotten dressed, thank God for that, and left the house, bare footed. I dont know where I went or what I did. I never put on shoes though.<br>  <br>  I used to get up and have coffee with my roommate Debbie before she left for work and would be sound asleep - I would even answer her if she asked me something. She said she could tell I wasnt "present" but was functioning. Not clumsy, not acting drugged just not totally present, the personality is flat and not animated.<br>  <br>  People dont believe sleep walking should be a defense in court, well as someone who has been a sleep walker I believe it should be. Its a legitimate affliction and I can see where it could have serious consequences.<br>  <br>  I also used to sleep with my eyes open a lot.  I couldnt actually see anything - but they were open.  Once my sister came into my room and screamed bloody murder because she thot I was dead, lying there with my eyes wide open staring at nothing, looking like a corpse.<br>  <br>  Could have been because of the child abuse, afraid to close my eyes?<br>  <br>  Thankfully havent had either for about 30 years now.  That I know of. Its scary !<br>  <br>  Never had any bed wetting or other problems I think many of the things listed are associated with people with mental disabilities and sleep walking.<br>  <br>  quote: "That said, there are instances in which people may be asleep with open eyes. One good example is sleepwalking. Usually, a sleepwalker will initially get out of bed and walk around the room with their eyes open. As the episode continues, their behavior can get very complex. They can avoid objects, go to the bathroom, even clean the house. All during this time, an electroencephalogram would indicate that this person is completely asleep. I would imagine you could also see this sort of phenomenon in someone who had been sleep deprived for a long period of time. They might at times appear behaviorally awake when their brain wave patterns are sleep-like. <br>  <br>  This observation actually poses a very interesting question: How are people able to carry out complex motor tasks when they are asleep?"

She could have an accident or get lost and not even be aware of what she is doing! Hope someone hides or locks the keys away from her when she goes to sleep.

Patients may appear clumsy and dazed in their behaviors. <br>  <br>  <br>  Typically, the eyes are open with a glassy, staring appearance as the person quietly roams the house. They do not, however, walk with their arms extended in front of them as is inaccurately depicted in movies. <br>  <br>  <br>  On questioning, responses are slow with simple thoughts, contain non-sense phraseology, or are absent. If the person is returned to bed without awakening, the person usually does not remember the event. <br>  <br>  <br>  Older children, who may awaken more easily at the end of an episode, often are embarrassed by the behavior (especially if it was inappropriate). In lieu of walking, some children perform repeated behaviors (for example, straightening their pajamas). Bedwetting may also occur. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sleepwalking is not associated with previous sleep problems, sleeping alone in a room or with others, achluophobia (fear of the dark), or anger outbursts. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some studies suggest that children who sleepwalk may have been more restless sleepers when aged 4-5 years, and more restless with more frequent awakenings during the first year of life. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *** I hope this helps***|`|HPFPRJegaa	My daughter sleepwalks and has done since she was very small.

lBw50ySpaa	One of our local citizens has successfully organized and run an Earth Day cleanup campaign.  He has locals who are interested help him.  For example, you can bring your old tires to dispose of for free.  Tire stores charge to do that even though some can be sold as used tires for $20.  He has beens for recycling ink cartridges, cell phones, newspapers, and cans.  He hands out free trash bags, gloves orange vests, and safety hints (ie watch for traffic and watch out for needles) to anyone who comes by saying they are going to do a roadside cleanup.  He stages it at the local civic center parking lot, and charges money to allow people to set up a yard sale at the same time.  That helps him pay for it all.<br>  Something I wish someone would organize in our community is a public service get to know you day.  They had these in Kennesaw, Ga when we lived there.  In the spring at a local community gathering area they would assemble a couple of police cars, an ambulance, fire trucks, and the mobile fire education vehicle.  The public was invited through flyers at businesses and sent home with elementary students.  It helps the kids feel comfortable with the public figures.  When it comes to being in a fire, some children will run from a fireman looking like a monster in is fireproof suit.  This way they get to see it first.  The fire house offers a lot too.  They let the kids climb in the police car and use the loud speaker and sirens some.  The kids got to climb on the fire truck and see into an ambulance and its compartments.  One year they even had the bomb squad robot do a demo.

But it is also old news, at least in my little circle.  The influence of emotions on the intellect and will has long been recognized among theologians.  Your main question about behavioral problems puzzles me.  Assuming I know what you mean by 'problems', they are proscribed by Christianity, at least.  I won't put words into the mouths of Jews and Muslims.  However, blaming a world view for the actions of those who don't follow it consistently is unreasonable.  I don't blame Euclid for the wrong answers students get on their geometry exams.  Why would I blame Jesus for the hypocrisy of His followers?  Just out of curiosity, who would you hold up as a better example than Jesus?<br>  <br>  peace<br>  <br>  -----------------------------<br>  As usual, you've skewered my imprecise expression.  But one can live as a consistent Christian.  "Is Christianity a world view?" would make an interesting question here.  But I'm just not in the mood to sift feces for nutrients today.

3EudCWEuaa	A little of both actually.<br>  <br>  I think it is much better to wait until you are ready to learn about all of them independently (when you are mentally & spiritually mature), and when you have a very strong interest, then you should really study all of it with an objectionable view point. I think that will lead a person to a stronger faith and a better understanding of their views, etc.<br>  <br>  At the same time, I don't think it hurts to believe in what your parents believe while you are young. I used to believe a lot of things when I was young that I heard from others regarding religion. It didn't hurt me, and I eventually did kinda what you did and just re-examined things for myself. I am still a Christian, but I do have some different beliefs on several topics.<br>  <br>  But by examining it all myself when I was ready, I think it made my faith and belief system that much stronger.|`|AA11569882	Definately.  You should never blindly follow a religion, it is disrespectful to the God you are worshipping, because how do you know you are doing the right thing?<br>  <br>  I think it would be best to try and learn as much as you can about every religion you can.  That way you'll be making a perfectly informed decision.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I think you need to choose for yourself.  God said, "I have put before you life and death; choose life".  Whatever you choose, it must be of your own choice, not something just "handed down" to you.  I would like to point out that Jesus made the statement He was the truth, the life and the way.<br>  <br>  Just something to keep in mind.|`|VncSMLMpaa	I think that it is good that parents show you that you should read the Bible because it is the inspired word of God. For those who have no guidance at all I think it is very difficult to understand what Christianity is all about. The problem being that there are so many churches and only the one truth. If you read your Bible thoroughly then you will know right from wrong when people try to persuade you of things.<br>  <br>  Young people find they have nothing to refer to in time of trouble if they have never known anything about God's ways and what Jesus did for mankind.<br>  <br>  They should not perhaps commit to a church and be baptised until they really understand what they are doing.|`|RermzbWgaa	A true belief would require real understanding.  I think it better for a person to understand their religion rather than simply a person born into it.  I do not think the two need conflict however (ie.  It is possible to both have been born into a religion and to come to a firm understanding of it).<br>  <br>  Part of the reason I believe God has been in my life is because my parents were His.  I also know what I am subscribing to however and do so of my own free will (even if that will had been influenced by my past....just as all men are).|`|AA10556726	Somehow the words "made an informed decision to become the religion I am now" don't sound like you objectively examined the options or your religion, whatever it is.<br>  <br>  But yes, it is better to be well informed and well educated before making life decisions.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	If your well educated, then you'd understand religion isn't the way to go..|`|jCgnnWmuaa	Research all the other religions when you become a full adult.|`|PDJjy0bPaa	I think you should see and think for yourself, so definitely choose your own.|`|dbw210qqaa	If you are educated you will not choose a religion<br>  <br>  What we all need is a personal relationship with the Creator God, and His Son Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit<br>  <br>  Please read First John|`|TMb076n6aa	It is good to seek God for yourself.|`|50UbJp14aa	yes, because you have an understanding|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	I advise you after you define what a religion should be to have a check list and then use it to rate each to your markings.<br>  <br>  Hints<br>  <br>  what is the purpose of religion<br>  the role it should play<br>  Is it man made<br>  or is it God dictate.<br>  <br>  if made made will one man be enough to finalize his findings and how good and reliable are these.<br>  <br>  if God dictate, what are the criteria for authenticity and credibility.<br>  <br>  Do this before you start your spiritual journey and then rate yourself how unbiased you are.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	Well, after you have educated yourself, that is if you've actually read other books besides the bible, you will find out that religion isn't necessary, it is man made.  <br>  <br>  Love is the greatest aspect of God, not religion.  Jesus said to seek the Truth and the Truth will set you free, he never said to seek religion.|`|6EA2VKXnaa	Yeah!

Being introduced to religion at a very young age sometimes can permanently alter a person's way of thinking and perceiving. It's indoctrination, like those children in the Mid-East who learn about Islam in a very militant, violent way. <br>  <br>  But no matter what someone is taught, if they grow and expand in life, they will eventually settle on the path that is right for them.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I think God wants us all to be informed, educated and bettering ourselves throughout the course of our lives AND I think He wants us to come to know and love Him as well.  I think once we KNOW HIM, love Him and follow Him we have a greater capacity to expand in knowledge, truth & wisdom because of that spirit of truth within us, through Him.<br>  <br>  I think using the foundation we have been given by our parents/home/family and then using our God given abilities, intellect, gifts, talents and sense to decide who God is TO US, where He fits in our hearts & lives and in what WAY and to what degree we wish to apply that knowledge and apparent FAITH would be the BEST CASE scenario in my opinion.  Putting off knowing GOd until we THINK we KNOW ENOUGH sounds like the inference in scriptures to those who "when they are learn-ed they think they are wise..." which typically isn't a very admirable way to be in God's eyes....  YOU should always find out for yourself - regardless of where you start from.

GROkWyBAaa	My main evidence that it was definitely imagination is simple. Look at the story. You were about 9 or 10. You stayed awake till midnight reading a boring (in my opinion) book. You're tired, and so you imagine the witch, because you're only 9 or 10.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Since you had been reading Snow White before you had this experience, I'd say it was most probably because you were a 9-10 year old child with a very vivid imagination.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	i'm sorry, but this sounds like the over imagination of a child.|`|xFbntCMNaa	thats kinda scary. talk to a consulor  so u wont be freaked out...|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	while it is more likely that you were too sleepy and your Imagination got to you..... it is also a very real possibility that you did indeed see a demon, or other manifestation of the forces of evil... they could have used that opportunity to act against you in some way... <br>  <br>  while the souls of departed mortals do not communicate in any way with this mortal world... the forces of evil can manifest themselves as any form they choose... there is no such thing as a "friendly ghost" any such sighting is a connection with the forces of evil... and very dangerous... it is good that you did not try to interact with whatever you saw.... if it was from evil it had nothing good for you.|`|FvMtam2Aaa	Well who really knows?  You might have been part of a time warp appearance of some unknown being who's to say you didn't see what you saw?<br>  <br>  When I was about 5 and my sister was 7 we swear we saw Santa Claus in the living room hiding behind the Christmas tree and pressed up against the wall.  Mom and Dad had always taken the door knob off so we looked through the hole.  To this day we still swear we saw what we saw and nothing around the tree could explain it.  Dad did NOT dress up as Santa and we were not well off enough to be robbed.  So go figure .....|`|EOs2XbM2aa	Well normally I'd have said it was your 9 year old imagination...but I'm not so sure after you mentioned the brown mark on the wall.<br>  <br>  Hmmm.....Interesting XD|`|0U3lbyX0aa	very creepy..how do you explain the scratch?
O7SshRl6aa	The birth rate has been lopsided for eons (really).<br>  <br>  More boys are born because more baby boys die in infancy, male youths participate in dangerous activities and sports, young men go to war and are killed.  If there are to be a fairly similar number of mature men and women at adulthood (for mating), more males need to be born, thus ensuring enough adult males.|`|0pVXLyGhaa	Yes, in the USA there are more boys than girls ages 0-14<br>  <br>  0-14 years: 20.1% (male 31,257,108/female 29,889,645) <br>  <br>  15-64 years: 67.1% (male 101,825,901/female 102,161,823) <br>  <br>  65 years and over: 12.7% (male 16,263,255/female 22,426,914) <br>  <br>  (2008 est.)|`|NBXY35zPaa	All my friends and family have had GIRLS, it's an estrogen overload, I'm tired of strolling the baby girls aisle buying pink stuff.

e5VUwaRsaa	Because Asia is a bit of a hole and I don't think Europe wants it.|`|cb88569354fa813399bd99b338324ae4aa	Just going by location... if there was to be an Eurasia it would be the middle east since it's in between Europe and Asia. But i dont know how middle Easterners would feel about that...|`|ArKT9O7Maa	I agree with that final part.<br>  European and Asian are sub-species of the human species.<br>  <br>  They probably are not recognized as Eurasia because a long time ago They did not know each other existed.  Early mapmakers named them Europe and Asia because they decided to, or they were payed to do so.  Another interesting thing is that during the Middle Ages, all of Europe was Catholic.  There were no Protestants until the Renaissance. The Pope ran everyone's lives, and he probably decided to split the continents because he did not want Muslims to be in the same continent as Catholics.  This is still the system we use today because we found it works.<br>  <br>  This is similar to why we named the New World America, not Columbia after Christopher Columbus.  (By the way, this was because Amerigo Vespucci was the first one to realize it as a new continent (there was no North and South America) and convinced a mapmaker to put his name on the continent.)|`|DmdvmZl6aa	Unless Europe and Asia recognize themselves as Eurasia (which they don't even though it's connected), it will continue to be refered to as Europe and Asia and not Eurasia. I think you just want to talk bad about Americans with this question. I can't believe you are blaming Americans for distincting Europe and Asia.

They're more likely just more overwhelmed than ruder, but it sure seems that way these days!!|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	That's because it's where people congregate to complain about rude people. :)<br>  <br>  I don't think it has made people ruder, if anything they're more polite in my experience.  For entertainment, they do things for free such as going to the park, so since they're not paying, they don't have to stress about being ripped off.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I don't know if the recession is to blame but something must be in the air or the water. lol|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I'm in Massachusetts.

66tTuuIFaa	I'm with you on this 100%. <br>  <br>  The church as a separate and private entity can feel free to marry whoever they deem appropriate. The government as an entity separate from the church should not be allowed to withold marriage from two consenting adults not of the same family. <br>  <br>  There are several churches that have opened their doors to homosexuals and these churches would have no problem issuing a religious marriage if the homosexual couple in question wants such a ceremony. For the rest of the churches they can perform marriage ceremonies based on their criteria. <br>  As long as both heterosexual and homosexual couples receive the same benefits for their marriages then this is the best solution I see to "The Great Homosexual Marriage" debate. <br>  <br>  It's either that or just ban marriage all together. <br>  <br>  Now I personally like being married but I don't think it's fair I'm allowed to marry my partner or choice when my best guy friend cannot marry his partner of choice. <br>  <br>  It's either all or nothing.|`|pOlDMXWdaa	I believe churches should have the right to decide to marry who they want. According to the Bible, homosexuality is a sin. If a church believes this, then they should have the opportunity to marry or not marry a couple as they see fit. To tell a church they have to marry someone that is against their religion would be discriminating against the church's right to religious freedom.<br>  <br>  Your rights end when another person's rights begin.|`|sPDOMTTjaa	I don't agree w/ you; allowing just any ol' church so much power & decision making opportunities only opens the door to a mad mad world. Regardless of what a church thinks about any marriage, you would still have to obtain a license from the state in order to be legally married.|`|cx8SnAnVaa	no you are right.<br>  Marriage is a religious term it should be done in churches.<br>  Civil Unions are a state term and should be done by law.<br>  Prop 8 is clearly overriding church with state, when it accuses those who support it of combining church and state.|`|GB1f4sEEaa	I agree and have put forth this question myself before. <br>  <br>  Mexico is set up that way. A couple go to the government and have a civil ceremony but if they want to be recognized as being married in the eyes of their religion then they go to the church.|`|RfOLqUKlaa	But then people married in a church will still feel self-righteous and sneer at everyone else because they are 'really' married. Just get rid of the churches altogether and then civil union will be the only option.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Church's should not be forced to marry gays.|`|fk4SoQ8Iaa	That's what I came up with after I thought about it.|`|Shi5z6iJaa	i agree then they can have their precious word "Marriage" if that's what it truly is all about|`|Ngo36BgPaa	BINGO - hit the nail on the head<br>  hit it out of the ball park<br>  hit it......oh, you get the drift|`|mFGyonmTaa	I agree as well.|`|K24JFTOcaa	the state run by the people, so take it to them|`|YkseyT7zaa	Marriage is just a word. It doesn't dictate how you actually treat each other or feel<br>  It sounds like a bunch of children wanting the same toy|`|E9chZY74aa	The problem is that you are not God and this country was built on what God thinks is right.  Marriage is defined in the Bible as one man and his wife.  No other "union" is condoned.  Sex is not honorable outside the marriage bed of a man and his wife.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	A church marriage alone is not a legally binding instrument.  Without the marriage license from your local county or state the church ceremony gives you no legal benefits, no legal recognition.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	I see your point. You can't force churches to participate if they don't want to. I just hope that those civil unions will provide all the benefits of fully legally recognized church wedding.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Yes, you are. Why not let the church grant civil unions, and let the rest of the people get married.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	yeah that would work, but even better would be if everyone just grew a brain and quit whining.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	I disagree with you for a few reasons.<br>  <br>  First, this sets up a "separate but equal" system for gay unions that will undoubtedly result in rights being doled out differently for a heterosexual marriage than a homosexual union.  This violates the equal protection clause of the US Constitution, and firmly entrenches the 2nd class citizen status of homosexuals in this country.<br>  <br>  Second, many gays are religious and want to marry in a church.  There is no reasonable, valid objection to gay marriage; it's pure bigotry backed up by superstitions and fables from thousands of years ago.<br>  <br>  Third, bigotry under the guise of religion should not be tolerated in the US.  If churches continue to actively discriminate, and disseminate prejudicial materials, against gays and other protected groups, I believe the government should restrict those churches from preaching to minors, and it should also prevent those churches from using government buildings and resources, receiving government money, and from supporting any organization that has minors as members (such as the BSA.)<br>  <br>  Does this violate the churches' rights to practice as they see fit?  Yes, but we've already established precedents in this country with the Mormons (polygamy), the Branch Davidians, and many other sects.  A church cannot use its beliefs to justify just any behavior.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I am sure you are not alone but I disagree.<br>  <br>  Marriage has become more than religious. I see no reason to mess with the words just to please these people whining about definitions. That is what its called- my fiance and I are not religious I am getting married damnit and I don 't want to be told I can't say marriage because it isn't religious!<br>  <br>  I most definitely do not agree with "civil unions" for homosexuals and marriages for heterosexuals, even just changing the word isn't truly equal.|`|AA11058044	I think governments should issue marriages to gays and straights alike, and if they really want to, churches can give out all the "holy union" ceremonies they want to only straights or whatever their kink is.<br>  <br>  Why should religious types get exclusive access to the word "marriage"?|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	The government should not be given the authority to legislate love or medical decisions.<br>  <br>  Ironic how the same people who fight for a "traditional" definition of marriage have no issue with changing the definition of "torture" and "war".|`|0bOSZIzJaa	Yep.  Makes complete sense.|`|JUviY9hoaa	Nope - You're not alone.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	I'm with you on this.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I think its a fair solution so long as they have equal rights. I wouldn't even care if some one wants to say my own marriage is a civil union. I'm heterosexual but not religious and married in a nonreligiuos ceremony. I am secure in what our relationship means to me and others don't determine its merit or worth for me. Some people though don't think they should have the equal legal rights and on the other side there are those who think using a different term instead of marriage is unfair discrimination along the same lines as the separate but equal ideas of segregation.

(John 17:3) the apostle Paul wrote that, to true christians," there is.......one God the Father." (1Cor.8:5,6)                                                                                                             Jesus is spoken of in the scriptures as "a god," even as "Mighty God."

Good for you.<br>  <br>  But you didn't read enough.<br>  <br>  Did you notice that it was the BODY of Jesus that was nailed to a cross?<br>  <br>  I don't know of ANY way to nail a spirit (God's Spirit, or any other's either, for that matter) to a cross.  I also don't know how to nail jelly to a tree.<br>  <br>  Somethings just can't be done.<br>  <br>  Jesus died when He was a mortal human.  If you had continued reading, you would have also read that He gave up His right to be considered God, that He humbled Himself and became a mortal man.<br>  <br>  While Jesus was on earth, He was as dependent on God as any of us, so He called on God as His Father, while everyone else calls on God as their creator.<br>  <br>  For you as a finite and temporal being to try to understand and look in to the face of the infinite and eternal God would destroy you.  But let me try to make this as simple as possible.<br>  <br>  You are a body, a soul, and a spirit - you are a tri-une being.<br>  <br>  You were created in the image of God.<br>  <br>  God is a tri-une being, consisting of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Prior to Jesus coming to earth, there was no separation or distinction between the members of the Godhead, just as there is no distinction between the parts that make up YOU: body, soul and spirit; three, yet one.<br>  <br>  But what WE can not understand - what WE can not do, God did when He somehow separated Himself so that one aspect of His Being came to earth and inhabited a human body, and so that aspect of God's existence became a human.<br>  <br>  While Jesus was living on earth, He was referred to as both "Son of Man" and "Son Of God".<br>  <br>  Sometimes he responded as the son of man.  He got tired, he got hungry, he was tempted, etc.<br>  <br>  Other times He responded as the Son of God.  He forgave sins; He commanded and rebuked demons and they had to obey; He raised the dead - BY  HIS  OWN  AUTHORITY (power)!<br>  <br>  So, Jesus was both fully man, as well as fully God, because the physical aspect of His existence was flesh and blood and bones and muscles, etc, just like us; but He was more than a mere man, because He was the temple or the dwelling place of God Almighty, by His Spirit.<br>  <br>  This is a long answer, but I trust that it helps you to see the glory and majesty of Jesus Christ, the Lord.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Read this verse....<br>  "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through Him. He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." (John 3:16-18)<br>  <br>  God did not SEND his SON into the world to judge the world...but that the world should be savedTHROUGH HIM.....|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Jesus is God manifest in the flesh.  <I Timothy 3:16><br>  <br>  Can God be on earth & in heaven at the same time?

However, your spirit will live forever. That is what is judged. Mixing the flesh and spirit is like mixing water and oil. Jesus had to come here on earth in the flesh in order for us to be saved. The flesh is weak. While "He" was in the flesh he had moments of anger and doubt. That is just what the flesh does. He is not God's "son" He is the begotten SON of God.

Someone went up to water and asked him why he was talking to himself.  Water said, "I'm not talking to myself, I'm talking to Hydrogen.   Me and Hydrogen are one and so is another Hydrogen.

Jehovah is the Lord God. He did die, BUT was raised. He drank up every evil deed and wicked act from the cup of wrath and took it all to the furthest point of destruction... but because He had no sin, the grave could not hold Him down. Yes God took human form so that He could die ONCE... but then was raised to life again. He died to undo death. He is the life giver. Jesus called Him Father because technically He was, Jesus is the Son born of the Spirit of the Father. but they are one being. the OT saints called God a Father and Teacher. the NT saints called Jesus rabbi which means father and teacher. God is able to do all things even die once... but never again. He will not die twice, to do so would mean He is in error. the second death is spiritual death. He died in this world so you and i won't have to die in the world to come.<br>  <br>  <br>  If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have SEEN him. John 14:7<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ****those who were raised before Jesus were in the truest sense resuscitated. when they came back to life the first thing they began to do was to die again. Jesus is the firstborn of the dead... He died in our corruption but was resurrected in God's incorruption. He is the prototype for all who will come after Him. we will be raised from death just as He was because of faith.****

J4lfOSPiaa	Honestly as a parent, I do not find anything wrong with your choice.  It sounds like you have covered all the bases and you have selected an apartment in a gated community for safety plus you have mapped out the city bus route.  If I had a daughter as clever as you, I would not only throw in the money for the apartment, but buy you a car to get to campus and back.  What is wrong with your Father?  Does he feel there is safety in numbers or something?  Is he concerned for your safety while traveling the city bus?  Can you ask him his objections?  You must be incredibly smart to be a Senior in college at 19.  Good grief what age did you graduate from high school?  I have known adults with less ability to plan than you.

Maybe you can tell your dad this. <br>  <br>  Anyways, he might be worried about you living off campus, because of the commute or the area you would be living in. Also, when you live on campus all of your bills tend to be worked into the cost. If you are off campus, this is not the case. It can really get expensive.

There is no evidence as to the innateness of religion or the lack there of. If you read Hume, he implies that polytheism is created to explain the inexplicable.

Conventional religions usually include a belief in the nature of deity, other religious beliefs, a moral code, religious rituals and sacraments, and a membership in a religious community. Rather, an Atheist's belief system is confined to one factor: the existence or non-existence of a deity. He or she will have a personal moral code. However, it would generally be derived from purely secular considerations, and will be unrelated to any religious texts. <br>  <br>  Most Atheists have analyzed the available material evidence for the existence of one or more deities (gods and/or goddesses) and have concluded that there is no real evidence of the existence of gods or goddesses. They generally believe that the universe, Earth and its life evolved by perfectly natural processes. They see no evidence of intervention or guidance by a supernatural entity. They generally feel that ethical and moral systems governing human behavior can be developed without reference to any code of behavior of allegedly divine origin. Other Atheists are people who have simply never been exposed to belief in a deity or deities and therefore have no belief in them. <br>  <br>  In ancient Greece, the term was used to refer to people who did not believe in the official pagan religion; i.e. unbelievers. "Atheism is derived from the Greek, atheos, and means simply 'away from the belief in a god or gods.' " 3 In ancient Rome, Christians and Jews were often called Atheists because they did not believe in the pantheon of Roman gods and goddesses. Until the word Agnosticism came into general usage during the 19th century, people we now call Agnostics were commonly lumped together with Atheists.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Atheism was there before god-beliefs came about.

GqfiRXu3aa	It depends who you're talking to.  If you're talking with a friend it's always best to say goodbye.  I had a friend who called me right back because he thought I didn't say bye and he was ready to b**ch me out.  If you're deailng with someone else, like a Comcast operator, it's fine to just say "thank you."|`|4z1gryIGaa	I didn't realize it until people this guy I was dating mentioned it.

It all depends on each person.  People can hear by the tone of your voice whether you were rude or not.<br>  There are many phrases that we say that can be taken in different way; merely by the tone of our voice.<br>  Sometimes, I say, "Take care" instead of goodbye, only because I mean it.  I wish for them to take care of themselves.  The tone of the voice also tells them if you really mean it or not.|`|ZAS9Bqwlaa	it just depends on who the person is.....if it's your boss than it's a completely different situation, he or she will probably fire you for just hanging up....any way if it's your friends than you could....if it's your family i would say good bye... saying thank you is a awkward way of sayin good bye but if it's the bizz than you would.<br>  Love<br>  the one and only<br>  Latisha|`|vd2ExGEraa	Well it depends on who your talking to.

Before that, I'd get a priest to clean the house out. While that is happening, I wouldn't leave babies in there.

Revelation 6:1“Come!” 2?And I saw, and, look! a white horse; and the one seated upon it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to complete his conquest. 3?And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: “Come!” 4?And another came forth, a fiery-colored horse; and to the one seated upon it there was granted to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another; and a great sword was given him. 5?And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come!” And I saw, and, look! a black horse; and the one seated upon it had a pair of scales in his hand. 6?And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: “A quart of wheat for a de?nar′i?us, and three quarts of barley for a de?nar′i?us; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.” 7?And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: “Come!” 8?And I saw, and, look! a pale horse; and the one seated upon it had the name Death. And Ha′des was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth. <br>  (2 Timothy 4:3) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled;(1 Timothy 4:1-5) However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons, 2?by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron; 3?forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth. 4?The reason for this is that every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 5?for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over [it].(2 Timothy 3:1-9) But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. 2?For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, 3?having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, 4?betrayers, headstrong, puffed up [with pride], lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, 5?having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. 6?For from these arise those men who slyly work their way into households and lead as their captives weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires, 7?always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.|`|AA11008046	of course it was!

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	Actually "speciation" does occur. The boundaries of the ‘kind’ written about in Genesis does not always correspond to any given man-made classification such as ‘species,’ genus, family, etc. But this is not the fault of the biblical term ‘kind’; it is actually due to inconsistencies in the man-made classification system. That is, several organisms classified as different ‘species,’ and even different genera or higher groupings, can produce fertile offspring. This means that they are really the same species that has several varieties, hence a polytypic (many type) species. A good example is Kekaimalu the wholphin, a fertile hybrid between a male false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) and a female bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), i.e., between two different so-called genera.<br>  <br>  It turns out that the very evidence claimed by evolutionists to support their theory supports the biblical model. Biologists have identified several instances of rapid adaptation, including guppies on Trinidad, lizards in the Bahamas, daisies on the islands of British Columbia, and house mice on Madeira. Another good example is a new ‘species’ of mosquito that can’t interbreed with the parent population, arising in the London Underground train system (the ‘Tube’) in only 100 years. The rapid change has ‘astonished’ evolutionists of course.<br>  <br>  Do these profound changes increase information? No—populations are seen losing information, and adapting within the constraints of the information they already have. In contrast, goo-to-you evolution requires something quite different—the progressive addition of massive amounts of genetic information that is novel not only to that population, but to the entire biosphere.<br>  <br>  The creationist model does not object to, and indeed, requires some form of "natural selection." However, the restraints on what natural selection can and cannot do must be examined closely. Most notably, it does not create new information, it can only act upon information already present. This is a telling argument against evolutionary theory as natural selection is promoted as one of the most important mechanisms of evolutionary development. It is the origin of complex information networks that must be explained by evolutionary theory, and this is, IMHO, the most vulnerable Achilles heel of the theory, for there is no adequate mechanism whatsoever for the creation of information content, particularly of the complexity necessary for even the "simplest" life forms. The bottom line is that there is no known natural law through which matter can give rise to information, neither is any physical process or material phenomenon known that can do this.|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	"Species" is a scientific term, not a biblical one. Scientists claim that new species have arisen from previous species, but they follow their own definition of species, and it doesn't really have any bearing on the biblical record.<br>  <br>  The Bible uses the word "kind," and it is more encompassing than the scientific term "species." Several scientifically defined "species" would fall under only one biblical "kind." The question should be asked: has science observed new "kinds" emerging? The answer is definitely no.<br>  <br>  Besides, all of the supposed new "species" that scientists have observed all all able to breed with the previous "species" they supposedly evolved away from. A good example is the domestic dog. It was supposed to have formed a new species thousands and thousands of years ago. And thanks to mankind, it is the most widely varietied species on the planet. However, dogs can still interbreed with wolves. They are the same "kind."<br>  <br>  Sixty some years of radition/fruit fly experiments have emulated about 10 million years of human evolution. Yet the fruit flies remain fruit flies, and can still interbreed with wild varieties.|`|SXB3I6Vraa	The problem with this question is...that evolutionists will simply equivocate on the definition of "speciation" every time you call them out on it. Essentially they'll just keep lowering the bar for themselves, to the point that even if two animals can genetically mate and produce fertile (non-sterile) offspring, they could still be classed as different species. Under many evolutionists defintions, even different breeds of dogs would have to be considered different "species" because of reproductive isolation, i.e., they simply choose not to mate with each other, or cannot (chiwawas and great danes). They also attempt to sneak the processes of plants into the equation, quite fallaciously.<br>  <br>  There is a good article here exposing all the fallacies presented in the first answer of this question and more:<br>  <a href="http://www.national-anthems.net/forum/article/misc.immigration.canada/244362" rel="nofollow">http://www.national-anthems.net/forum/ar...</a><br>  <br>  and here:<br>  <a href="http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/Encyclopedia/10mut10.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedi...</a><br>  <br>  =edit=<br>  This is the clever little language loophole that evolutionists use:<br>  <br>  They typically say that two creatures that are reproductively isolated are different species.<br>  <br>  reproductive isolation is a category of mechanisms that prevent two or more populations from exchanging genes...Reproductive isolation can occur either by preventing fertilization, or by the creation of a degenerate or sterile hybrid, such as the case with the common mule and the hinny.<br>  <br>  However<br>  <br>  Pre-zygotic barriers to fertilization include everything from a physical barrier (such as an ocean) formed between two populations, to ethological (behavioral) differences, to errors in cell division that cause incompatibility between populations.<br>  <br>  Yes that is right - if an animal pair simply chooses not to mate or if they are simply prevented from possibly mating by geographical barriers, then viola! Speciation event for the evolutionist.<br>  <br>  It is quite easy to make science and evidence say whatever you want it to say when you control the definitions of the terms that you are using to support your own arguments.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	You will only get micro-evolution answers.  <br>  For the theory to be true, the fossil record would have to blend by small changes.

Gould - or ANY science book at all. <br>  <br>  Thank you though for another good argument for only teaching proper science classes in schools.|`|AA11058044	Speciation has been both observed and proven.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Claim CB910:<br>  No new species have been observed.<br>  <br>  Response:<br>  <br>     1. New species have arisen in historical times. For example:<br>  <br>            * A new species of mosquito, isolated in London's Underground, has speciated from Culex pipiens (Byrne and Nichols 1999; Nuttall 1998).<br>  <br>            * Helacyton gartleri is the HeLa cell culture, which evolved from a human cervical carcinoma in 1951. The culture grows indefinitely and has become widespread (Van Valen and Maiorana 1991).<br>  <br>              A similar event appears to have happened with dogs relatively recently. Sticker's sarcoma, or canine transmissible venereal tumor, is caused by an organism genetically independent from its hosts but derived from a wolf or dog tumor (Zimmer 2006; Murgia et al. 2006).<br>  <br>            * Several new species of plants have arisen via polyploidy (when the chromosome count multiplies by two or more) (de Wet 1971). One example is Primula kewensis (Newton and Pellew 1929). <br>  <br>     2. Incipient speciation, where two subspecies interbreed rarely or with only little success, is common. Here are just a few examples:<br>  <br>            * Rhagoletis pomonella, the apple maggot fly, is undergoing sympatric speciation. Its native host in North America is Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), but in the mid-1800s, a new population formed on introduced domestic apples (Malus pumila). The two races are kept partially isolated by natural selection (Filchak et al. 2000).<br>            * The mosquito Anopheles gambiae shows incipient speciation between its populations in northwestern and southeastern Africa (Fanello et al. 2003; Lehmann et al. 2003).<br>            * Silverside fish show incipient speciation between marine and estuarine populations (Beheregaray and Sunnucks 2001). <br>  <br>     3. Ring species show the process of speciation in action. In ring species, the species is distributed more or less in a line, such as around the base of a mountain range. Each population is able to breed with its neighboring population, but the populations at the two ends are not able to interbreed. (In a true ring species, those two end populations are adjacent to each other, completing the ring.) Examples of ring species are<br>  <br>            * the salamander Ensatina, with seven different subspecies on the west coast of the United States. They form a ring around California's central valley. At the south end, adjacent subspecies klauberi and eschscholtzi do not interbreed (Brown n.d.; Wake 1997).<br>            * greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides), around the Himalayas. Their behavioral and genetic characteristics change gradually, starting from central Siberia, extending around the Himalayas, and back again, so two forms of the songbird coexist but do not interbreed in that part of their range (Irwin et al. 2001; Whitehouse 2001; Irwin et al. 2005).<br>            * the deer mouse (Peromyces maniculatus), with over fifty subspecies in North America.<br>            * many species of birds, including Parus major and P. minor, Halcyon chloris, Zosterops, Lalage, Pernis, the Larus argentatus group, and Phylloscopus trochiloides (Mayr 1942, 182-183).<br>            * the American bee Hoplitis (Alcidamea) producta (Mayr 1963, 510).<br>            * the subterranean mole rat, Spalax ehrenbergi (Nevo 1999). <br>  <br>     4. Evidence of speciation occurs in the form of organisms that exist only in environments that did not exist a few hundreds or thousands of years ago. For example:<br>            * In several Canadian lakes, which originated in the last 10,000 years following the last ice age, stickleback fish have diversified into separate species for shallow and deep water (Schilthuizen 2001, 146-151).<br>            * Cichlids in Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria have diversified into hundreds of species. Parts of Lake Malawi which originated in the nineteenth century have species indigenous to those parts (Schilthuizen 2001, 166-176).<br>            * A Mimulus species adapted for soils high in copper exists only on the tailings of a copper mine that did not exist before 1859 (Macnair 1989). <br>  <br>        There is further evidence that speciation can be caused by infection with a symbiont. A Wolbachia bacterium infects and causes postmating reproductive isolation between the wasps Nasonia vitripennis and N. giraulti (Bordenstein and Werren 1997).<br>  <br>     5. Some young-earth creationists claim that speciation is essential to explain Noah's ark. The ark was not roomy enough to carry and care for all species, so speciation is invoked to explain how the much fewer "kinds" aboard the ark became the diversity we see today. Also, some species have special needs that could not have been met during the flood (e.g., fish requiring fresh water). Creationists assume that they evolved from other, more tolerant organisms since the Flood. (Woodmorappe 1996) <br>  <br>  Links:<br>  Kimball, John W., 2003.

Catholic canon (especially in the Middle Ages in the height of its power) was intensely violent, and Sharia Law (touted as law derived directly from the Koran, but the actual relationship is quite a bit fuzzier) also is violent and in many respects cruel.<br>  <br>  So I would say that Christianity and Islam are by their very nature violent... through no fault of the original message.|`|LHcdLTOxaa	How would you explain the holy war being accepted as a part of the religion in Islam?

02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	I'm no fundie nor do i freak out if some one i know is GAY.  But here in lay's the problem as i see it. Most people do not like absolutes specially when it involves Morality.I do not know any way else to say this but my Church for example we do not Hate Homosexuals but hate the homosexual sex act. We only require that they stay chaste just as we would expect non married heterosexuals to stay Chaste as there sexual misconduct out side of marriage is just as much a sin as a Homosexuals sex acts. So what happens when we or another Church says fornication is wrong then usually those with guilty consciouses become offended and do not like the absolute of hearing what there doing as wrong. Just like a shop lifter they do not like hearing what there doing is wrong as that means the excuses they made or just blocking the wrongness out of there minds is now in there face.I hope i've explained this so you understand where i'm coming from and i have no problem with Gays either as long as there not trying to force me to except there life style.And i guess in a way they might say the same about Religious people and granted there are those who do try to force there religious convictions on others but as for me and most Catholics i know we only when asked answer the question and do not go around shoving our beliefs on any one as all we can do best is live our lives in such a way that others would want to be part of us.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Someone who does not want to get out of his closet and admit that he is like a  thief angry at another thief.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Limited.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Conservative|`|jTVbjyghaa	Bible-thumper|`|fitsd4FGaa	Mentally ill|`|AA11008046	These people in the bible are referred to as "stiff necks"|`|yvDzvIbBaa	i call them ''ropers''<br>  <br>  after the Phelps loons.|`|0l1yibjyaa	It's hypocrisy. A person can't claim to have a love for Jesus, yet call out and criticize the homosexual. Jesus spent quality time with all kinds of sinners (including homosexuals). Not once did He chastise any of them.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	Fundamentalists.  They're usually very closed minded and annoying to talk to.  I avoid them.|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"very strict and very religious"|`|xU0xtg2zaa	Homophobic|`|0DC6d8pOaa	Fundamentalist.<br>  <br>  Fundy, for short.|`|qbIng0dIaa	i have heard of the people you are talking about, but i have also talked to some very sensible religious people|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Fundamentalist.

I just call them closed-minded|`|K8QTdUnfaa	wacked|`|yAoldffKaa	I freak out about gay people -shudders-|`|OMgF0RcIaa	Well up here in the North Country the term for those people is "redneck".|`|9PoGLVmXaa	If you don't have a religion then why should we consider you an expert on religion?|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Crazy losers.|`|AA11849917	I would call that person, "very strict and very religious."<br>  <br>  Honestly, this is what your rant sounds like (I'm presenting the same thing, just using a different perspective, so you can see clearly what I think of your rant):<br>  <br>  I also refer to police in the same way, because they don't let ANY body get away with going 45 miles per hour in a school zone with children running back and forth across the street!  They are SO strict, and they give out tickets religiously!<br>  <br>  Me, myself, I don't have a problem with people going 45 miles per hour in a school zone with children running back and forth across the street!  I have no problem with people running over little children!|`|VYLEfiSTaa	If they over react it is probably a result of a lack of knowledge.. Poor Bible studies...Read 1?Corinthians 6:9, 10 says, according to the New International Version: “Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral .?.?. nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders .?.?. will inherit the kingdom of God.” And, according to this same Bible translation, Romans 1:26, 27 says: “Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men.”|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Isn't the proper way to go about this having you tell us all what you mean by 'very strict' and 'very religions' cuz I'm a thinkin it means 'doesn't think a pervo is a sweetie' would just about cover it.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	I would probably describe them as fundies but I actually know some very religious people who are kind and don't shove their religion down anyone's throat.
8MzVCzi0aa	not if the stereotype is stereotypically typical hence stereotyping the stereotype|`|aaRMPDIDaa	That's what a stereotype is!  Its labelling one group a certain way because statistically speaking, it is common among that particular group.  The reason stereotypes offend people is because it generalizes a certain population, and leaves no room for individuality. Not  to mention, most stereotypes are negative.|`|4fc9aa87352e3e2f25ca35455cdfb596aa	No. Because think about it<br>  Stereotypes come from somewhere. But the thing to remember is that a stereotype isn't true for all of the type of people in that group.<br>  <br>  Example-<br>  All whites are racist.<br>  -Not true. Many whites aren't racist. The kids are my school ( i go to a diverse school) have friends of different races.<br>  All blacks are loud and ghetto.<br>  -I'm a good example of this. I am actually kind of shy and I don't speak in slang (unless I just really wanted to).<br>  All hispanics are illegal.<br>  - There are hispanics that were born here, ya know.<br>  <br>  Well that is all I got for now. Have a nice day.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Its called a stereotype because its not true. You can't possibly apply a statement to an entire race. It's just not possible. And when people say "well most of them do" thats complete bull. Do you KNOW most [whatever race] people? No you only know the few you've come into contact with and what the media shows you on the t.v. which plays a huge role in what we think about people that are different from us.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Well stereotypes are true but they don't apply to everyone. So that's where the problem is.<br>  <br>  lol @ "training day" you made my brain go in circles|`|euQFQzc5aa	I was under the impression people gave up on being individuals a long time ago.
hXwX8dwsaa	crap that means I have to rebid on that lamp on eBay|`|tsgP2JfBaa	I think that it's a ridiculous philosophical position.<br>  <br>  But no more ridiculous than thinking that God created the universe in such a way that it has every appearance of being several billion years old - while being only a few thousand.<br>  <br>  It's a position that assumes that reason and objectivity can tell us nothing true about our surroundings.  Since God could have made it look any way he wanted it it to.  It would also mean that God is a liar.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	It's retarded.<br>  <br>  That means that there must be some outside agency able to create the universe with the appearance of design. There's no more evidence for this condition being met for "Last-Thursdayism" than there is for any other form of Creation.|`|9d2cc6a06849ed43a202ad7ecc292799aa	Rubbish as I was watching tv and I would have noticed I am a mother after all and we know everything.<br>  Seriously I am a subcriber to the theory of The Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago and until someones comes up with another crediable theory I am going with that.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	In more general usage, you're refering to Last-Thursdayism, which is the philosophical stance that the universe was created last Thursday in exactly the state the universe existed at the time, with the implication of being much older.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	That's even stupider than nihilism.
lk03YYPEaa	I know how you feel. I spent 4 years living in Utah (no offense to any Utahns), and I've been in that situation many times before.<br>  I personally feel that it's unacceptable to try to get one to change their religion when they've already said no.<br>  <br>  Just tell them "No, thank you," and smile. If they persist, let them know that you're happy with the religion you have, and would appreciate it if they'd stop asking.|`|AA10819407	I agree with "Jonas". I also respond by saying thank you for the invitation, and for thinking of me...<br>  <br>  <br>      I currently live in Ga. USA and I am always asked what church do I go to...|`|AA11828439	Personally, I gave up with polite. Rude seems to work better. I tell them I am a member of the First Church of the Gooey Death and Discount House of Worship. It is a George Carlin reference.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	Firmly and politely let them know you are not interested.  Don't let them tell you a little about their faith and refuse all literature.  Be courteous, smile politely, but ask them to please leave.  If they harass you contact the authorities immediately.<br>  <br>  You can't argue with a fanatic. They know the whole truth and nothing you can say will get them to see your point of view.  <br>  <br>  Some of the faiths that have been known to heavily proselytize have been known to be cults.  I'll provide a few links to some web sites that deal with victims of cults.  You don't ever want to get caught up in a cult.  Members of a cult should be pitied not hated.  <br>  <a href="http://www.rickross.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rickross.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cultinformation.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cultinformation.org.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/</a>|`|u4liwDhAaa	I would say (and have said) "I am a Catholic and do not wish to be converted.

Enough said.)<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|AaXl3vcCaa	i put a sign by my door that says "i am perfectly content with my current religion thanks" and they have not bothered me since, it was a daily thing for them to come by in the town i grew up in|`|GqfiRXu3aa	"Thanks, but religion is a private matter for me."|`|O1b7das7aa	Tell them that you are Jewish. This is what I tell the Jehovah's Witnesses and they respectfully leave us alone.<br>  <br>  If they know you are not really Jewish, just be honest with them. I was honest with a co-worker who kept inviting me to her ladies church group.  I told her that I appreciated the offer and I respected her beliefs, but I am not interested in joining, converting, etc.|`|AA10430184	I politely tell them that my husband and I are quite happy with our beliefs and have no interest in theirs. It also doesn't hurt that I have signs on all of my doors saying "No Solicitors, Please. This Includes Religious Materials."<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, threaten to call the police on them for trespassing on your property.|`|S8pIwxpwaa	Say, "I appreciate the offer, but I'm just not interested. Thank you." Do not say it with a fake smile-- said with a straight face or an honest smile is always best.<br>  <br>  The thank you at the end is needed, because it signals that you're done with the topic.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|6Mngo3eTaa	I think a simple No, thank you should do, unless you've already tried.

AA10034285	Which "scientists" can you possibly mean? No reputable real scientist would associate himself with such a nonsensical inquiry.<br>  <br>  Some people will believe almost anything, especially anything that is taught to them in childhood by someone they trust. That is human nature, and there have always been those who have been eager to exploit it.<br>  <br>  All organized religion is a power game of one sort or another in which the individual counts for very little, but many individuals, who can be cleverly guided by ruthless people, become a force to be reckoned with in politics, economics, and military strategy.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	Uh, if any scientists believe they've found the body of Jesus, it's a very very small group of, ahem, "scientists."|`|U5KIOutnaa	??|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Ha ha.

All of it is.<br>  <br>  <br>  ???|`|htQrkD8waa	is what?<br>  <br>  thier own weight issues?<br>  <br>  in short yes,<br>  <br>  with the caveat that there is A VERY SMALL minority of the population who simply are fat because they have a medical condition.<br>  <br>  <br>  in long answer- yes, but food manufacturers and supermarkets share a part of the burden.<br>  <br>  for the longest time- food manufacturers have tried to effectively hide certain negative and harmfull substances from public disclosure- most recent and most noteably trans fat.<br>  <br>  also misinformation campaigns by the corn industry tend to try to show high fructose corn syrup in a better light- which are only HALF-TRUTHS.<br>  <br>  deceptive marketing practices and also the way supermarkets stock thier foods (did you know that food companies pay a preimium for certain placement in a supermarket isle on shelves?)<br>  <br>  so while yes- indeed ultimately the buck stops at the person in question-<br>  <br>  however food companies muddy the waters and try to confuse the public with erroneous terms like "sugar free" (that doesn't mean no sugar substitutes) and "low fat" and "approved by the american heart association" (which is a label that food companies PAY FOR- there is no "vote").<br>  <br>  as for my quip relating to the recent corn industry's commercials (thier new round of misinformation to decieve you- thier adoring public).<br>  <br>  well look at what you buy- HFCS is in EVERYTHING.  <br>  <br>  now technically it IS harmfull to you- it is more likely to give you diabetes than regular sugar and bypasses your brains "i'm full" switch (which is why you can guzzle a 2 liter of pepsi and not feel full).  <br>  <br>  however- it is true that in order to incur such increased risks as a reality- you are probably consuming foods you should not be consuming to begin with- which is high sugar content snacks.<br>  <br>  but the fact that it is in "everything" means you don't consume it in moderation in reality- so even moderately sugared foods become an issue now.<br>  <br>  this is just an example of why it might be largely the fat person's fault- but the food companies do share some blame for that.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>  "genetics" is a poor excuse- although it plays a part, it is not an excuse to be a "lard ***".  you might have piss poor genetics and have to be more mindfull of your diet and excercise and even then may never be "joe 6 pack" but you will be much much better off than if you didn't, would avoid weight related health problems and at least you would be trim enough to not be considered "fat" or "obese".|`|0JE41mXsaa	For being fat?  <br>  <br>  Most research indicates that:<br>  a) Diet<br>  b) Activity / Lifestyle<br>  and finally c) Genetics<br>  <br>  that affects body fat.  <br>  <br>  If you are doing well with a) (see a licensed nutritionist, or dietitian)and b) (see a physical trainer or doctor) be consistent and nothing works then you can blame (c).<br>  <br>  Note:  New research also suggests that depending on your blood type your body may react differently to food than other people.

AA10248239	We don't celebrate them in our family.  I don't think it has anything to do with praising.  We praise human beings all the time, saying things like, "You did a good job," or, "You're a wonderful husband."<br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad, sall-Allahu aleyhi wa sallam, said that we only have two feasts:  Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.

It's not correct without the right verb ending.<br>  <br>  Saying things like you have read, you used to read etc is complicated because instead of inserting the Spanish word for "have" they would say tu (u accent) leiste (i accent). Every tense has it's own endings that vary by verb type.<br>  <br>  The only way to learn to use them effectively is to take a Spanish class and/or spend a lot of time in a Spanish speaking country.

But it can also challenge and undermine religious power structures. In the Middle Ages, for example, there was a dialectical relationship between the rigid strictures of religious orthodoxy, which aimed to bolster the dominant power structures, and the chaotic discourses of popular religion (the cult of saints, pilgrimages, reform movements, etc.) which challenged and sometimes threatened religious power structures. This dialectic is found in most religions.<br>  <br>  NFA - that is not, actually, what Karl Marx claimed.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	No, you genius, you.

In true New Testament, Christian belief, there are not supposed to be any spiritual (religious) controllers apart from Jesus Christ the Son of God (the true Deity).  That part of Christianity got thrown to the way side shortly after Jesus left the earth.  The part in the Bible that talks about "One Lord (controller), one faith, one baptism" means exactly that.  Jesus Christ is "supposed to be" the only controller of our lives (as far as religion goes you could say).  Anybody wanting to challenge me can email me.  I can elaborate further.

2zLtIog3aa	You will be amazed at how easy it is. I am a 31 year old gay male that recently came out to my mother. I grew up in a very conservative home and in a country where homosexuality was a taboo. <br>  In my mind, I never thought I was would tell my mom. However, due to a broken ankle... I came out to her. <br>  I live in Minnesota, and as you might now,its very cold and icy here. I slipped in the ice and broke my ankle in 3 parts. Since I needed surgery, my 69 year old mother, decided that she would fly up here to take care of me. Needless to say, she wasnt aware that I lived with my partner of 3 years, who was also taking care of me. <br>  After a couple days visiting me, she put two and two together and told me: " I know" and I said, great! do you want to talk about it? She was upset, but not as much as I thought she would be. I started my converstation by explaining that I was human before being anything, and who I went to bed with, was a private part of my life, and not who I was. I told her that I was very happy with my life and not ashamed by it. I told her that in todays world it is more accepted than it was during her young days. I also told her that I had never been with a woman, so I knew that it wasnt a choice. And, that I would never be with one to make society happy. I told her that if I got married and had kids, I was only going to hurt myself, my wife and kids...as it was very probable that I would "Slip" She asked me to reassure her that i was "OK". I told her, YES and very happy! and I was proud to be what I am, and thanked her for being such a wonderful mother. <br>  She is now very close to my partner and we all spend Thanksgiving and Christmas together. It was great. She even got her more gifts than she got me!!|`|a3ZZkY08aa	Just sit them down and tell them you have something very important to tell them....be honest and direct...its hard I know..but once you tell them it'll be like a HUGE weight is lifted off your shoulders|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	You tell people by telling them. No big secret method, you just do it. You speak to them honestly and tell them.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	i would just tell them that you have discovered something important about your self, and you really want their support. tell them that you dont want them to think any less of you and that it's hard to tell them, make sure they know that it's probably harder for you to tell them that than for them to hear. just ask them to be supportive no matter what and then just say, i am gay. and i dont want to hide it from you.|`|LsHkgexvaa	Just pick a time when you are comfortable and tell them about your sexual preference. I know if my son or daughter came to me with this admission, I would love and support them as I have always done. Best of luck to you and your friends/family.|`|fzqtUZ0Oaa	go up to them and say that you are gay. no fancy talk, just immediately let it out|`|F0Ktt82Faa	"hi mom, I'm gay"|`|ql1KyDJdaa	Well my best friend is gay and if it helps i will share with you how he told me. . . . <br>  He said Do you hate gay people or have anything against them? and i said no of corse not why would i. and he said i dont know i was just wondering and i said why and he said because i am gay and then he asked if i hated him and i said noo wayyyy why would i and after that he started being more open to it BUT dont just go and tell everyone like he did make sure they are people you trust because now he gets made fun of because some people are just sooo crule. I hope I helped GOOD LUCK|`|nrdPJvufaa	Don't.  It's none of anybody's business what you do in private with another man or woman.|`|gQZZWHHkaa	Just tell them...one day just say "Oh yeah I'm gay and I wanted to tell you." Thats all I did and it worked
jwT20biwaa	No I do not believe I am inferior because I am a gay man.<br>  <br>  I do believe I am more understanding of differences in people of all orientations, cultures and races as a direct result of being a gay man.<br>  <br>  In my youth I had to hide my orientation for fear of reprisal, social excommunication, and dismissal from church on the sole reason I was gay.<br>  <br>  I embrace myself and feel good that I can see how bigotry, insults and hate have hurt many in my lifetime and having seen that I am more open and aware of the need to be respectful.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Well, people are taught that being anything other than straight, and like everyone else is wrong, and inferior. But we're not all the same. So these real negative attitudes get internalized as we realize we're different. I think a lot of it is subconscious, and it always takes checkin' yourself, and having a healthy mind set, and being positive an accepting of yourself, negative thoughts an feelings will creep in, but you just gotta keep them out. It's similar to what any minority has to face. It's a shame, because we're not born with guilt, we're not born hating ourselves or feeling inferior, it's taught, and you have to unlearn it.|`|N73oZyY8aa	No, not at all.|`|AA11587429	Honestly?  Yes, a little bit.  I always assumed I'd live a life similar to what my parents led.  Get married, have kids, pass my genes to the next generation.<br>  <br>  But it's hard to have kids of your own when you're gay.  I don't identify with "gay culture", so I feel like an inferior gay.  I'm kind of in the middle, and haven't met many similar people.<br>  <br>  I have tons of other strengths in other aspects of my life that make me feel superior - but sexually, I feel short changed.  It's kind of like when you order something at the drive thru, only to discover that they forgot to put half of your order in the bag.  You did all you could to make sure things went as planned, but you still got screwed and it was no fault of your own.  It just isn't fair.|`|ulsWSKQdaa	This is a good question and it's not offensive...<br>  I do not feel inferior; I feel special because I get to live an interesting life|`|KszocgnSaa	Sometimes people make me feel inferior because they insist on pounding things into my head...things like stereotypes and other mean stuff. I don't think that way on my own.|`|XjLvbfTZaa	Absolutely not.|`|gQZZWHHkaa	Not really...I don't know why but whenever someone makes fun of me for being gay I can't help but think "If only you knew the happiness I know you..." I'm not gunna finish it but the first part says it all. I feel privileged to be part of a small group of people that sees a different view of the world. So in other words other people find me inferior but I find me to be special in a way.|`|zVwbYjuoaa	I don't feel inferior but I do feel "different" in certain social situations. However, when I am in a comfortable environment where gays are embraced then I feel like a totally fulfilled normal person, not inferior at all.<br>  The most inferior I ever felt was when I was trying to play straight, but was really gay. Then I felt like a liar and a big mess. That made me feel inferior.<br>  Embrace your sexuality. Gay people live in amazing times in the United States. I am a 45 yo gay man, and 20 years ago I wanted to adopt and I was told it would be nearly impossible in my state. Today, my state openly allows gay adoption.<br>  Why are gay people becoming more widely accepted? Because, gay people came out and the rest of the community recognized that gay people are very productive members of society and should not be discriminated against for this difference. <br>  Gay people are unique in their sexuality, but are equally human.|`|3uRM7FKIaa	Absolutely not do you because you are not? Again it comes down to the stereotype that being gay is "wrong" while being hetero is correct.<br>  <br>  When will you people learn. "Walks off shaking head and muttering about moronic questions in this section".|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	Not at all. I'm gay and I enjoy it. I am no less of a human being. In fact, I probably have a more interesting and entertaining life than a straight person. No, I'm not talking about a promiscuous, stereotypical, "gay lifestyle". I love being homosexual.|`|EAHsmeXLaa	No. anyone who thinks that someone is inferior to them due to their sexuality is insecure and intolerant.|`|eGvyFeW9aa	It actually makes me feel like I'm better than everyone else in most cases.|`|bOrthb6faa	No. But other people assume I am inferior because of my sexual orientation. Pathetic.

JofcuUQ8aa	I see a lot of answers that are correct in that you should report her, however I understand why you would hesitate.  Reporting her would most likely cause you even  more problems in the long term when you are dealing with a person like that.  You will still have the aggravation and fear of facing her every day.  For some, that's not a big deal, but for others it's enough to make you not want to go to school.  It's a bully issue that is as old as the first school.  Sadly, this young lady's parents fell down on the job as far a raising a decent human being.   <br>  <br>  Obviously you are your own person, which I admire.  Unfortunately, there will always be ignorant people who are afraid of people who are 'different'.   It is especially difficult when you get large 'herds' of ignorant people together in one place, where people start 'herding' into seperate groups.  Many young people are cruel and do not understand or care how much they hurt others.   I have come to the conclusion that home schooling is the best option.  I know this is seperate topic that generates a lot of different opinions.  I see no benefit in the 'socialization' aspect of going to regular schools if it adds to the destruction of  self-esteem, causes fear which effects the ability to concentrate in class, and jeopardizes personal safety.  I wish you luck and I am sorry I couldn't offer a simpler solution.|`|O1b7das7aa	Of course it was rude and uncalled for. <br>  <br>  Next time, after she kicks you, take her picture. Then call 911 and file assault charges.|`|a4srLWrlaa	That is really rude!<br>  She has no right to kick you when you're minding your own business.<br>   Whether you're wearing all black or a bozo the clown suit, it's still assault.

It gets on my nerves, so I know exactly how you feel.<br>  Tell a teacher or an administrator if it happens again.|`|q15damBIaa	Grab her foot and pull it up, she will be made a fool of in front of everyone, and you will feel a hell of a lot better, She's just a loser with low self esteem who feels she sould pick on you because you are better than her! Good Luck with Her if all else fails, Yes file a complaint against her for assult. Xxx|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	"This is behavior is testing the water. Today she kicked lightly, tomorrow may be a shove, in a week it could progress to a violent act. "<br>  <br>  this person has hit the nail on the head.  She is testing to see how much  you will tolerate without retaliating. It probably will escalate, since you just walked away without at least blocking her kick.   What she did is assault AND battery.  This is a crime, and it should be reported.  The fact that she didn't do it hard enough to cause damage is irrelevant.  Without consequences she will do it again and with more force.  Remember Columbine?  Those two shooters were Gothic.  They finally snapped from all the abuse they had been subjected to.   If your school administrators have any sense at all they will take appropriate action to keep  history from repeating itself.<br>  <br>  Now, as to what YOU can do.. avoid being alone on school grounds. Even one other friend present will deter a lot of bullies, since they don't really have the guts to take on two of you.  Besides, you would then have a legal witness to back up your side of the story.<br>  <br>  When I was in public school,  it was perfectly acceptable to beat up the bully and prevent them from bothering you again.  It worked for me.  But now with all these ridiculous zero tolerance policies they punish the person defending herself, a basic human right.  I can get a harasser fired (did so), but school kids can't defend themselves from assault?  How messed up is that?  <br>  <br>  You may have to decide if it's worth the suspension to go ahead and land a sound kick to her kneecap if she repeats the behavior.  yes, you'll both probably get suspended, but you'll have taught her you won't tolerate physical abuse.<br>  <br>  What do your parents say about this?  Tried the school counselor?  I really feel for you.  You have a right to go about your business peaceably and not be harassed.|`|AA11280073	That is an assault. Go to the principal and report her. You could also file a police report.|`|hXFndli2aa	Oh man this girl is evil...but i agree with you, this was so not called for...she probably did it to show off and look like lil bad *** or something...don't let her get to you, some of us are just more tolerant and accepting than others.

Maybe she was just lashing out at anyone she could. Perhaps it has nothing to do with your clothes?  <br>  I'm not saying that this excuses her behaviour at all, but it might just offer some insight<br>  <br>  IF you are able, I would try to talk to her calmly about this. Perhaps you can resolve the issue. If nothing is done about it, it's bound to get worse before it gets better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Totally uncalled for rude and ignorant on her part.

I'm sure you are probably afraid of the harassment you'll have to bear (from the kids or the person in question) if you go directly to the principle. <br>  <br>  With the GC you can discuss your feelings on this matter. He or she can give you feedback AND (most importantly), it will be documented! <br>  <br>  This way if anything else comes up with her (which I'm guessing it's not going to end at this), you will have an adult aware of the situation.<br>  <br>  You can't trust people like her and she definitely has a problem.

Son of Terah; grandson of Nahor (No. 1); and brother of Abraham. (Ge 11:26; Jos 24:2) Nahor married Milcah, Lot’s sister and the daughter of Nahor’s other brother, Haran, hence Nahor’s niece. By her he had 8 sons, and by his concubine Reumah he had 4 more sons, totaling 12, some of whom became tribal heads. (Ge 11:27,?29; 22:20-24) Through his son Bethuel, Nahor became grandfather to Laban and Rebekah, and great-grandfather of Leah, Rachel, Jacob (Israel), and Esau.—Ge 24:15, 24,?47; 29:5,?16; 1Ch 1:34.<br>  <br>  The Genesis account of Terah and Abraham leaving Ur of the Chaldeans does not include Nahor’s name in the list of travelers. (Ge 11:31) It does seem, however, that he may have come later, for Abraham’s servant, seeking a wife for Isaac, traveled to Haran, where Terah took up dwelling and where he died, and where Nahor’s grandson Laban lived when Jacob went to him. (Ge 11:31,?32; 12:4; 27:43) Abraham’s servant came “to the city of Nahor,” either to Haran itself or a place close by, perhaps the Nahur frequently mentioned in various Mari tablets of the second millennium B.C.E. (Ge 24:10; 29:4; The Biblical Archaeologist, 1948, p. 16) And when Jacob parted company from Laban, Laban called on “the god of Abraham and the god of Nahor” to judge between them.—Ge 31:53; see HARAN No. 4.<br>  <br>  What about Abram’s immediate family members? Evidently, Abram’s faith and conviction had a dramatic effect on them, for both his wife, Sarai, and his orphaned nephew named Lot were moved to obey God’s call and leave Ur. Abram’s brother Nahor and some of his offspring later left Ur and took up residence in Haran, where they worshiped Jehovah. (Genesis 24:1-4, 10, 31; 27:43; 29:4,?5) Why, even Abram’s father, Terah, agreed to leave with his son! The Bible thus credits him, as family head, with making the move toward Canaan. (Genesis 11:31) <br>  <br>  Abram’s brother Nahor stayed behind, perhaps to finish caring for some business or personal matters. But later Nahor’s offspring also left Ur and worshiped Jehovah in Haran.—Genesis 11:31; 24:1-4, 10,?31; 27:<br>  <br>  When Job was tested, his knowledge of God and his purposes was limited, since no part of the Bible had yet been recorded. However, Job would have known something about Jehovah’s dealings with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. This is because Job was evidently a descendant of Abraham’s brother Nahor, through Nahor’s firstborn son Uz. Furthermore, the brother of Uz was Bethuel, the father of Isaac’s wife Rebekah and the great-grandfather of Joseph. (Genesis 22:20-23) Job no doubt came to treasure whatever knowledge he had of Jehovah’s communications with Abraham and his descendants, and he was anxious to please Jehovah. Thus Job became a man of outstanding integrity, a man blameless and completely devoted to Jehovah.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Abrahams brother.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There are no such things, but in the minds of a certain group of individuals, the hybrid vampire is a human who needs to drain lifeforce, if you will, from other people, either by ingesting their blood or taking this energy psychically. There is not one single shred of scientific evidence that this actually occurs, nor does any supposed evidence such as Kirlian photography provide empirical data. Kirlian measures electromagnetic fields, so by that evidence a "psychic vampire" could "refuel" by standing next to an electromagnet. Ingested blood is not transmitted directly to the bloodsystem - it is chemically broken down by the digestive system. There is no medical condition that requires the ingestion of blood, nor is there any medical diagnosis of any physical condition labeled "vampirism" - Renfield's syndrome is a psychological diagnosis, and like it there are other diagnosis of psychoseses where individuals believe themselves to be vampires, but it is all a delusion.|`|MSEyXHFWaa	"Ok, Nureses and anyone else who reads this, I don't care if your smart and have an education, so don't read or answer!"<br>  <br>  Wait... you don't want "anyone else who reads this" to "read or answer"?<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry, but I've just read it and answered.

7uNASlURaa	Does it matter?  Be yourself, don't try to be the stereotypical homosexual.  You are who you are, be proud!|`|syIp6d2Naa	Well it depends on where your going. I have very long hair and yet had very short hair when I was in the army and working as a nurse. In uniform then your hair had to be up off the collar of the uniform either twisted up or short. When I worked in hospitals I kept it short because I really didn't have the time to do anything else. I am seeing a lot of the females I know leaving their hair long and yet dress very masculine. If your where other lesbians are you should get the message across with out cutting the hair. You might want to do something like a braid, or like one of my step-grandaughters who is black and has long hair she wears hers in braids and when she goes to the clubs no one figures she straight. (as a grandmother I wish some of them didn't notice) :-)|`|XjLvbfTZaa	You don't need to go so far as to cut your hair short.

For example some women:<br>  1. will wear a rainbow article of clothing i.e. a bracelet or ring. <br>  2. cut their hair short (i.e. the DYKE SPIKE)<br>  3. wear baggy clothes and play sports<br>  4. fall in love with plaid<br>  5. wear "I Heart Lesbians" shirts<br>  6. get interested in artsey things<br>  Keep in mind, this will present more of a stereotypical dykey appearance. (though many lesbians do one or more of the above things) However, if that's what you're going for then by all means. I do more of an odd ball thing. I:<br>  1. wear dark or white dress shirts untucked with ties of the opposite color (black with white mostly)<br>  2. cut my hair short and die it black with blonde chunks<br>  3. wear mens watches <br>  4. love converse<br>  <br>  Really you can do whatever you want. Good luck!|`|11zPDTJ8aa	If you want others to know, you need to make it clear by getting a really short clippercut.

If you want to cut your hair short then go for it but I wouldn't do it just to give out a stereotype. <br>  <br>  If you want to meet other bi or lesbians how about you search around the local area to see if there are any sports clubs, social groups or dating places that cater for LGBT that perhaps you could attend to meet other girls rather than hitting the bars.

Iqp3ZUAlaa	The descent has been traced to the Mrudah clan,the the al Sauds say they are related to  the large bedouin 'Anizzah confederation of northern Arabia and the Syrian desert. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Sa...</a>  says:<br>  "The earliest recorded ancestor of the Al Saud was Mani' ibn Rabi'ah al-Muraydi, who, according to the chroniclers of Nejd, settled in Diriyah in 1446-7 with his clan, the Mrudah. Mani had been invited to settle there by a relative named Ibn Dir', who was then the ruler of a set of villages and estates that make up modern-day Riyadh. Mani's clan had been on a soujorn in east Arabia, near al-Qatif, from an unknown point in time. Ibn Dir' handed Mani' two estates called al-Mulaybeed and Ghusayba, which Mani' and his family settled and renamed "al-Diriyah", after their benefactor Ibn Dir'.[3][4]<br>  <br>  Genealogically, the Mrudah are regarded as belonging to the ancient Arab tribal confederation of Rabi`ah, through the branch of Wa'il. However, there is disagreement as to which branch of Wa'il they belong to. The dominant opinion in their native Nejd is that they are remnants of the now-extinct tribe of Bani Hanifa, who are credited with founding most of Nejd's settlements including Riyadh. The oldest written reference to the Mrudah, a short genealogical manuscript from the 17th century, supports this view. Others, including many members of the Al Saud themselves, however, insist that they are descendants of the large bedouin 'Anizzah confederation of northern Arabia and the Syrian desert. The earliest written reference to this view comes from the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, on the authority of Anizzah tribesmen whom he encountered in northwestern Arabia in the early 19th century. Both the 'Anizzah and the Bani Hanifa, however, are branches of the Bani Wa'il of Rabi'ah.[5]<br>  <br>  The Mrudah became rulers of al-Diriyah, which prospered along the banks of Wadi Hanifa and became an important Nejdi settlement. As the clan grew larger, power struggles ensued, with one branch leaving to nearby Dhruma, while another branch (the "Al Watban") left for the town of az-Zubayr in southern Iraq. The Al Migrin ("House of Migrin") then became the ruling family among the Mrudah in Diriyah. After some initial struggles in the early 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud, of the Al Migrin, became the undisputed amir ("prince", or ruler) of the town and its surrounding estates. In 1744, Muhammad ibn Saud took in a fugitive religious cleric named Muhammad ibn Abdel Wahhab, from nearby al-Uyayna. Ibn Saud agreed to provide political support to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's project to reform Islamic practice, which Ibn Abd al-Wahhab believed had strayed far from the ideals set by the Muslim Prophet, Muhammad, and his companions. This marked the beginning of the First Saudi State. Later on, Saudi loyalists came to refer to Muhammad ibn Saud and his successors by the title of "Imam", signifying that they saw the emir of Dir'iyyah as the temporal leader of an Islamic state, rather than simply another clan leader or village ruler."

IBSsKAB3aa	i like the first idea better. you might want to give out some prizes. you might also want to think about telling the people invited to bring another set of clothes and a towel and shoes maybe because if you play water relay races, they will get wet.|`|c8kZgIMmaa	You could have a dance party. You could rent a fire hall or something and have a DJ or a stereo/radio and turn the music up loud and invite all of your friends. You could have pizza, chips, cake, etc. to eat.|`|XVZhoec2aa	uh have a real party with dancing and guys and no parents. beats everything else by far
Im9cwUIyaa	Start with the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans and how they viewed and practiced it.  Then you could talk about monotheism and persecution against gays.  But you could also look up how the Native Americans viewed it.  They believed that being gay was sacred.  very interesting.
1TT9oiO0aa	It's hard, because he's straight, and the chances of the 2 of you being together are minimal. I'm sorry if that is what you didn't want to hear, but you sound mature enough to take it. I just don't think this is worth pursuing - he may be resistant to being your friend if he thinks you're going to want more, and even if he accepts you as being gay (which I think he would), it would only make your infatuation worse if you thought that meant he would like to be with you, in a relationship. <br>  <br>  I think my best advice for you would be to distance yourself from this guy. There's nothing wrong with being his friend, but maybe you could try visiting Gay bars etc to meet more like-minded guys? There are funny, nice, and goodlooking guys who are gay and may feel the same about you. Isn't this more worth pursuing than a straight guy who won't be interested in you? At most you might get a drunken kiss, but anything more than that, I highly doubt. It would only mess your head up even more!!<br>  <br>  I have been in this situation, and the woman was straight but we did end up having a little thing. But I soon realised that it would be pointless, because I'm lesbian, and I didn't want to be the one to "turn" her. I soon left the relationship (although officially it was not a relationship). I turned my attention to the lesbian community and found happiness with a woman there (who is still my girlfriend). <br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|n50UCC2Naa	i havent personally been in this situation,but my best friend has and i fully witnessed it.<br>  she was a straight female like myself but she fell very hard for me,and it literally nearly killed her being around me.<br>  its not a nice thing.<br>  but dude maybe this guy isnt straight=] Theres always always a chance.<br>  sneakily ask his opinion of Same sex relations.That always works ;]|`|ZzYy2szvaa	That pretty much describes my first experience as well, except for the age gap.<br>  <br>  I may only be 16, but at the time, I really fell hard for one guy.  I did my best to stop the feelings, but I just loved being with and around him.  I saw him at school everyday, so that didn't help at all.  I am straight acting and he never knew that I am gay.  I struggled to get over him for months (about 9 months), but I did eventually.<br>  <br>  The advice I'm going to give you know is really horrible, but it must be done:<br>  1)  You must accept that nothing is going to happen, and that if you don't move on, only more hurt and pain will come to you.<br>  2)  Avoid him.  I mean really do your best to see him and to talk to him as little as possible.  I promise that this is the best and fastest way (and probably the only way) of getting over someone.  <br>  <br>  One year after falling in love with that guy (about a week ago) I told him I was gay.  He took it fine.  I hadn't really spoke much to him since august, but now since January we've become friends again.  The feelings have subsided and we can just be friends without complications.<br>  <br>  If your love for him is as potent as mine was for my "crush", then you're in for a rough time ahead, but you'll get through it!<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your question.  If you need more help or have more questions about your 'crush' or how my story goes, email me @ elite360.cameron@hotmail.com, ok?  Good luck!|`|oai2o5rvaa	hi spicey<br>  i have been in a similar situation<br>  whereas im not gay, i had a man crush, u know wat tht is? well anyway he was giving me mizxed signals, like touching my butt and stuff and i liked him back, i thot he was hot. then, as i knew i couldnt do anything with him as i knew i didnt want to and it was only part of growing up, i fully analysed him. im not trying to put you off him but you should pick out his worse habits and focus on them, you will soon go off him, however DONT DO THIS FIRST<br>  always try and see what he is really like. have a convo with him and swing it round to same sexness and you will soon find out hwat your looking for. dont be afraid chum, life is for living, not for standin back.<br>  hope i help,adam|`|h5e62x6Kaa	Yeah, I've been in this situation before. I have this thing how I fall effortlessly for straight girls... It sucks. But I bear with it and stay friends. x] Feel better. If it helps, I think you should just stay friends with him since he sounds like a very great person to be around with. :)|`|VVk0hHgpaa	I say leave him alone.  He's straight!  The chances of  him liking you sexually is about zero.<br>  <br>  To add:  I know you thumbed me down because my answer is true!

You can find us at <a href="http://nosayudamos.ning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nosayudamos.ning.com/</a>|`|AA10270701	Sometime I volunteer with a charity called World Relief.  I would look for a charity or outreach organization in your town that deals with people who speak English.  They are looking for help so you get the good feelings of benevolence as well as an opportunity to talk to native speakers firsthand.  I would also try the oral section of Rosetta Stone.  If you have a mic it will rate your speech..not the best way, but it's worth a shot also.|`|06Rlukp7aa	watch some tv and try to imitate them. Also practice singing English songs, more fun than talking. If you're going to Australia you should google, "Aussie slang" and could practice imitating an "Aussie" just for fun.

4AfZ9Zywaa	i'd look right at him to see if it was <br>  a) a mistake <br>  b) an insult<br>  <br>  then I would <br>  a)accept an apology and move on<br>  b) ask for an apology. if none is given and they walk away, I would inform them that I want an apology. if none is given and they stay where they are, I'd spit on them and wait to see what they do.|`|AA11946005	Not much, because if they are spitting on people, more than likely they are mentally imbalanced, so doing anything would antagonize them further.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Walk away as quickly as possible.  I'd be very upset.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your project.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I have never been in this situation (thank God) but if I was, I would probably call the cops.

Legal action should be saved for when a real harm is done by someone, not just for the sake of being able to make trouble. Stop the teacher privately (after class, in a hall or office) and simply state that you did not appreciate them making a comment about your eyes being red.

Mi primo mayor, Brian, se sintió mal, así que nos ayudo a hacer uno nuevo y mejor. Mis tías y mi mama se sentaban en las casitas y cocinaban todo el día. Solo salían algunas veces a jugar con nosotras. Los hombres de la familia hablarían o jugarían al ajedrez. Fue el mejor viaje de todos.<br>  <br>  Mi primer mu?eco de ni?a (you're a girl right? because if not, it's 'ni?o') fue mi mu?eca. La llamaba Chelsea. Nunca pasaba un día sin que yo jugara con ella. Mi hermana y yo llevábamos a nuestras mu?ecas afuera y jugábamos por horas y horas. Yo adoraba a mi mu?eca. Al crecer, compre muchas nuevas mu?ecas. Pero siempre fue mi favorita. Ella era pelirroja. También era alta y flaca. Siempre tenía atuendos bonitos.

AA12006309	Yes it does.  We're all considered "sexual minorities".  This question gets asked at least once every other day in this section.<br>  <br>  There are lots of transgender and transsexual people who also identify in the LGB spectrum.  Also pre-op transsexuals are also stuck in the unique position in regards to relationships and orientation.<br>  <br>  Example. I have a friend who is a FtM pre-op who fancies women.  Straight women aren't interested in him, because biologically, he's still female.  Lesbians aren't interested in him, because his gender identity is male, he presents and dresses as male, and is essentially MALE, and they fancy women.  Where does that leave him?<br>  <br>  So yes, we are a sexual minority, we do face the same forms of discrimination that the LGB community faces, and we need to stick together as a cohesive, supportive community.|`|7aK81hsbaa	what about "united we stand, divided we fall"? i think it applies. all of us have been persecuted by 'main-steam' society. and all for sexual reasons.|`|fmr98EBtaa	I think the T is grouped into LGBT because we're all "gender confused". I really don't mean that literally or hurtfully (I'm gay myself), but I think that the general public groups them because they believe we're all similar in that we either don't like the "correct" gender or that we don't act according to our gender. I personally have no problem with the transsexuals being grouped with me. We obviously face the same sort of discrimination and stereotypes. Plus, after all the hardships I have experienced, why would I want to discriminate against someone who has had to go through the same things I have. Even if I may not be able to completely understand your intentions, it's not a problem with me so long as you are doing what makes you happy. :P|`|qzwWVgWMaa	I don't think the 'T' is appropriate with LGB but I have a reason for saying that.... I am a gay male but I feel that while the 'L' 'G' and 'B' define a sexuality the 'T' is a gender issue. I have no problem with transgenders, I know quite a few who are all friends of mine and they are obviously equal members of society are as us, gays, lesbians, and bi's but I don't feel we all belong in the one category. Sexuality and Gender are totally seperate things. My transgender friend agrees with me on this.<br>  <br>  At the same I have no problem with it being LGBT I just don't think we should all be labelled so vaguely. As a community I do think that we all work great together so at the same time I don't think there is a real point in changing it at this stage if that makes sense. It's all a VERY complex issue, sexuality and gender, I guess we are all human at the end of he day :)<br>  <br>  Just my opnion :)|`|AA12316360	I think it belongs there because whether it is gender or sexuality based, it is considered a minority, for what are perceived sexual reasons.  Whilst I totally get where you are coming from, the reality is if you start taking it away from the LGBT then you will need resources just for the T bit, in some areas, these resources do exist, but in most areas, they do not, so they get lumped together.  Chances are that the LGBs will understand the plight of the Ts on at least one level.  In order to provide things like youth groups, drop in centres and therapy, they get lumped together, or there will be less money for both, and as the Ts are in an even smaller minority than the LGBs, the liklihood is that the money would be given to the larger minority and the Ts would miss out entirely, so for that reason alone, I think it belongs there, though strictly speaking, it is not a sexual orientation issue, it can be, but it is usually a gender issue, not sexuality.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	"T" being in 'LGBT' is OK I suppose. Why not?<br>  <br>  If you fancy girls then you are not a male to female transsexual. You're a straight male.<br>  <br>  If you really fancy girls then you wouldn't need to have female hormones and be castrated would you?<br>  <br>  It just doesn't add up.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	There's nothing I hate more than an oppressed group being prejudiced against their own.  Jeez, enough people hate us, why turn on ourselves.  I totally understand: bi people are sometimes hated by gays, too, although I'm sure you have more trouble.  That guy is as much a bigot as people who won't talk to gays.  He thinks he's better than you because he has a constant gender.  Please!<br>  <br>  Don't give up.  Just be yourself and people won't be able to hate you.  (Okay, so for all I know you're a real ogre, but I doubt it.  I've met lots of trans people and never one that I didn't like.  I think your situation makes people more understanding and compassionate.)  You will find lots of friends in your life who will love you for who you are.  My friends and my darling love don't care that I'm bi, I'm just ME.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be strong.  ((()))

Therefore, that represents a lot of surface area that we have YET to really exploit to its fullest. <br>  <br>  We have ALSO yet to really tap the full energy potential of the Earth and develop the subterranian areas of the Earth.  <br>  <br>  So, we are A) thinking mainly of the dry land portions of the Earth and only really those which fall into a very limited habitable "clime" within that.   B) We are thinking primarily 2 dimensionally and NOT subterranian or  vertically,  or under the sea. <br>  <br>  So is 8 billion REALLY the max?  Is 10 or even 12  really the max?<br>  <br>  THEN, the real caveat to all this is WHAT if God knows the max carrying capacity and what technologies we will develop and has already calculated all this in, and plans on "intervening"  (AKA end times)  BEFORE we exceed this maximum ???

This is one big reason the population in the past remained stable. It has only been in the last two or three centuries that the world population has skyrocketed to outrageous proportions. We haven't had a world war for over 30 years. That's a long time. And that's why our planet is overpopulated. I am not saying this to be cruel. It is just a fact.

tNx9IchNaa	In my honest opinion kid, its not the most important thing in your life. It might seem like it, but driving is just a small part of growing up. Trust me, once the realities of owning a car come to you one day, you might look back on these times more favorably because they are simpler. In the meantime, if you really want to convince your parents, try challenging them to let you get your license by keeping certain grades or doing work around the house for a few months. If they still won't budge, murder might be an option? Totally kidding - but even if they won't budge, you will have control over whether they are in a retirement home one day. ;)|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Its a large number of parents and it has nothing to do with her ethnicity. A large number of accidents involve people from ages 16-21 so she has a reason to be worried. Not to sound like a parent because i am not one yet but kids your age think driving a car is just fun but it can be very dangerous and you have to pay full attention to what you are doing and you cant just watch where you are going you have to watch what the people closest to you are doing as well and teenagers have Add without driving so imagine one behind the wheel
AA11047076	Its all part of Islam's retroactive adoption of everything from earlier religions into itself in order to appeal to as large an audience as possible  This was common to most early religions (Judaism being distinctively different in that it often took stances directly opposite to the religions around it when it was founded). and was done to make it easier toconvert people.  Since Mohammed wanted to convert the Jews and Christians, as well as the Pagans around him- he included figures from both earlier religion sin what he taught to try and co-opt them into Islam and thus broaden its appeal to those he wanted to convert.|`|073ad2ba60d8cf71ef3514ad2f5a92eaaa	He was not a jew. Judaism is assumed to be the religion from Prophet Moses pbuh. Prophet Ibrahim was Muslim it's in the Quran. sorry cant remember the verse. There was no Islam before Prophet Muhammad so that the followers be called muslim. All the prophets were muslim means that they surrender to Allah and his commands. They had the same source so u cant say that because now some jews are the enemies of Muslims. Prophet Moses, Naoozo bellah, is the enemy for muslims or our Prophet.|`|tfkpNh89aa	As far as islam being an Abrahamic religion, it is only so because muslims claim it is. They claim Abraham practiced islam. <br>  <br>  Yet nowhere in Genesis do we have Abraham practicing anything that muhammed taught. Therefore the claim is a false one.<br>  <br>  We know that God is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  If God is Allah, then that means Allah is the Holy Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Therefore, all muslims must worship the Holy Trinity. <br>  <br>  Try convincing them of that and see how far you get.  By their fruit you shall know them.|`|7d41bc8d8005e8cdc7e2dd4b1921581caa	WHAT ISLAM SAYS ABOUT THE TRUE PROPHET ABRAHAM (peace be upon him) <a href="http://islam.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.islam.org/Mosque/ibrahim.htm" rel="nofollow">http://islam.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsit...</a><br>  <br>  Muslims means when they say Adam,Abraham,Moses,Jesus (peace be upon them all) and all other true prophets were Muslims = Islam refers to a state of belief in the absolute oneness of Allah, and the message of his prophets, and that a Muslim is one who submits himself wholly to Allah.<br>  <br>  so prophets before prophet Muhammad (pbuh) were also teaching the same thing, so those teaching made them Muslims. You can't even understand that.|`|nWB0NC9Iaa	The Place of Prophet Ibrahim in Islam, Christianity and Judaism<br>  <br>  Faith, sacrifice, commitment and patience.<br>  <br>  These are just some of the qualities that characterize Prophet Ibrahim or Abraham as he is called in English (peace be upon him).<br>  <br>  So it should come as no surprise that he is revered not just in Islam, but in Christianity and Judaism as well. Prophet Ibrahim is also a great personality to discuss in dialogues between Muslims, Jews and Christians. Here is some basic information about him from the three perspectives:<br>  <br>  1. ISLAM<br>  <br>  "Salam (peace) be upon Abraham!" God says in the Quran (37:109).<br>  <br>  In Islam, Prophet Ibrahim is the friend of God and the father of Prophets (Ismail or Ishmael in English and Ishaq or Isaac and the grandfather of Prophet Yaqub or Jacob). He is also one of the ancestors of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).<br>  <br>  Anyone who rejects Prophet Ibrahim is not a true believer in Islam. Prophet Ibrahim plays a key role in this regard.<br>  <br>  In terms of beliefs, a Muslim must believe in all of the Prophets. This includes not just Prophet Ibrahim, but his sons Ismail, Ishaq, his grandson Yaqub and of course his descendant Prophet Muhammad.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the five pillars of Islam, the importance of Prophet Ibrahim becomes even more evident.<br>  <br>  The second pillar of Islam is Salah, the obligatory five daily prayers. Every Muslim who has reached the age of puberty is accountable for their prayers, be he male or be she female, whether they live in the desert of northern Arabia, a village of northern Pakistan or an urban center of North America.<br>  <br>  During one part of each of these five prayers, Muslims must ask God to send His blessings upon Prophet Ibrahim. Now calculate this: you've got more than a few million Muslims, every day, five times a day, in virtually every time zone on this planet asking God to send His blessings on Prophet Ibrahim in the course of his/her prayer.<br>  <br>  More importantly, the direction in which every Muslim must face when praying is towards a structure Prophet Ibrahim built with his son Ismail: the Kaba, in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.<br>  <br>  With regards to the Kaba, God says this about it: "The first House (of worship) appointed for men was that at Bakka (another name for Makkah); full of blessings and guidance for all kinds of beings: in it are signs manifest, the station of Abraham-whoever enters it attains security; pilgrimage thereto is a duty men owe to God-those who can afford the journey; but if any deny faith, God stands not in need of any of His creatures"(Quran 3:96-97).<br>  <br>  This leads to the second way in which this Prophet, described as the intimate friend of God (Quran 4:125), is revered: Hajj.<br>  <br>  Hajj is the pilgrimage every Muslim must make to Makkah at least once in his/her lifetime. Hajj is also an obligation no Muslim is allowed to reject or ignore. It is in this rite that Prophet Ibrahim's importance becomes even more prominent.<br>  <br>  In general, Prophet Ibrahim's centrality to this fifth pillar of Islam is indicated by the Prophet Mohammed's statement, You must adhere to the traditions and rituals (of Hajj), for these have come down to you from (your forefather) Ibrahim in heritage (Tirmidhi).<br>  <br>  First, the Kaba is the central structure around which the Hajj takes place. No Hajj is valid without going around this structure built by Prophets Ibrahim and Ismail in counterclockwise fashion seven times.<br>  <br>  Second, Muslims who perform the Hajj or Umra must run in the middle portion of the distance between Safa and Marwa (two hills close to the Kaba) seven times. This is a commemoration of the sacrifice of the wife of Abraham, Hajira (may God be pleased with her) for her son Prophet Ismail<br>  <br>  Prophet Ibrahim had settled his wife and son in the valley of Makkah by God's order to pioneers a civilization. It was from this civilization that the Prophet Mohammed was born.<br>  <br>  Finally, Prophet's Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his beloved son Ismail for the sake of God exemplifies not only his sincere devotion to God. The commemoration of this sacrifice is practiced with the sacrifice of an animal during Hajj and one of the two Islamic holy days: Eid-ul-Adha.<br>  <br>  Both father and son willingly submitted to God's command. God substituted a ram in Ismail's place at the last moment. God talks about this incident in Quran 37:100-107.<br>  <br>  The sacrifice that is offered by Muslims all over the world every year (at Eid-ul-Adha) is in commemoration of the supreme act and spirit of sacrifice offered by Prophet Abraham in lieu of his son Ismail.<br>  <br>  2. JUDAISM<br>  <br>  According to A Concise Encyclopedia of Judaism by Dan Cohn-Sherbok (Oneworld Publications 1998), Prophet Abraham is the father of Jewish people.<br>  <br>  According to Scripture, he was the son of Terah and the father of Isaac, who was born to Sarah, and he is also the father of Ishmael, who was born to Hagar.<br>  <br>  After leaving Ur of the Chaldees, Abraham traveled to Canaan, visited Egypt and returned to|`|Czl7BGV7aa	"Muslim" means "one who submits to the will of God." When you take this literal meaning, then it means that Abraham was a "muslim" in the sense that he "submitted" to God's will. It doesn't mean that Islam was his faith, only that he submitted.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|kvRhnn7daa	Don't they just consider Abraham to be a forefather? Not the founder.

cIZS6Wr2aa	Because of the times.  This world today says to our young people, "Accepting everyone, every belief, every sin is good!  Anyone who doesn't accept everyone and their lifestyles and beliefs is bad!"  They equate acceptance with love.  Christians are warned to be careful what we accept.  We get our code of morals from the bible, not tv or the world.  The world loves it's own.   Jesus warned us that the world would persecute us for our convictions.   His words were true.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Because they see only this secular world, which accommodates sin regularly, and actually are against righteousness.

Do not be fooled. Many people believe that it is living a holy life that gets you into heaven. This is not true. It was for Israel. Not for the Body of Christ. We are saved strictly on Christ's performance on the cross, NOT on our performance here on earth.<br>  God held the nation Israel to higher standards than other nations, because they are God's chosen people. Thus it was that they were commanded to live a holy life, under the Law. The law was insufficient, though. That is why there was the "loophole" of sacrifice for the washing away of sin, because the wages of sin is death. Innocent animals paid the price for what men did, with their blood.<br>  <br>  Christ changed all that. He paid the last price needed for sin, because God concluded ALL in sin, and unbelief. God did not elevate Gentiles up with Jews, but rather cast Israel away for a time, putting them as being no different than Gentiles. <br>  So, ALL people are concluded in sin, and unbelief, so that God could have mercy on ALL.<br>  <br>  The people that you speak of in this question, if they are believers, are abusing the grace of God. They shall suffer a loss in heaven, as written by the apostle Paul. If they are not believers, then they are just doing what is natural for them. If they are unbelievers that have rejected Christ, then they will be judged accordingly.<br>  EDIT: You may thumbs down me all you want to. That is the problem with people that profess to be Christians. They believe that they will enter heaven by living a holy life. If that were true, then salvation would be of works. Try paying more than lip service to the grace of God. When you understand that you, yourself are saved, ONLY by God's grace, and NOT because you are holy, and deserve to be in heaven, then maybe you will stop judging others.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	People can no more choose to be homosexual than can they choose to be heterosexual or anything in between. Why would anyone choose to be gay? There are no consolation prizes. Rather, gays and lesbians can be fired from their job, lose their apartment, have no implied inheritance rights, little legal protections, face ridicule and scorn, face vile hatred and castigation from the likes of Fred Phelps and Jerry Fallwell as well as every major religion. Who would choose that?<br>  <br>  As far as mores and morals, heterosexuals engage in far more sodomy than homosexuals. I do not see religious leaders calling for a ban on oral or anal sex. If those acts are the true foundation of your arguments, why did the fundies push for restrictions against same-sex marriages instead of a Constitutional amendment banning sodomy?<br>  <br>  Newt Gingrich, big supporter of DoMA and huge sodomite who cheated on his wife while pushing that legislation. Trent Lott was on his third marriage when pushing for that marriage protection. Gays have hurt the "institution of marriage?"<br>  <br>  If homosexuality is such a big deal, why was Jesus completely silent on the subject?<br>  <br>  I am surprised that so many people respond to a question dealing with homosexuality yet these people have absolutely no experience with the subject. They speak from a position of complete ignorance. It's like trying to describe chocolate without ever having tasted it. <br>  <br>  Ask a homosexual if it was his/her choice. Almost every one will tell you no. Why would someone choose to be persecuted, face a life of discrimination, risk loosing their apartment, risk losing their job, risk the public scorn of others?<br>  <br>  Religion has no monopoly over marriage. Marriage has always been about inheritance and property rights. Read Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe by John Boswell for a very in-depth examination of the sacred text from which the Bible was derived.<br>  <br>  Early Christian Gnostics had no problem with same-sex unions I believe it was the Catholic Church in the 13th Century that broke away from the Gnostics and added all these rules. Keep in mind that movable type wasn't invented until the 16th Century so Bibles were not accessible to the masses until many many many years after Christ's death. Even the Gospels were not written until many years after the death of the disciples.<br>  <br>  God hates shrimp!<br>  <br>  Oh, and as for your comment that only Christians weigh in, I think you got that wrong. Only homosexuals should weigh in on a subject about homosexuals.

He even tells us what sin is in His Commandments. The Bible has been around thousands of years longer than any of us have been alive, so we are without excuse in our ignorance of His Laws. People choose to believe that some sins are OK, because they have rejected their Creator and His Law. They don't want some "Sky Daddy" telling them how to live. This is the most brazen form of rebellion that we see today. Satan has warped their minds into believing that they are their "own little gods". They have been "turned unto fables" - such as the lie of Evolution, which is a philosophy (not a science!) that removes the need for a God. Even Thomas Huxley said that they rejected God because they didn't want anyone interfering with their sexual mores. That pretty much sums it up.

However, I don't think one needs to view the gods as being cruel simple because bad things happen.  They have an entire universe to run.  Death is part of the natural cycle.

That is why religion is incredibly powerful.<br>  <br>  And, there are other ways of thinking about your pain, your desires, the unfairness of it all - and I don't mean drugs.<br>  <br>  The pain your feelings is like the pain from a broken arm, and every time you reach out, or bump into someone, the arm hurts even more.<br>  <br>  Painkillers (drugs) won't fix your arm.  And, there is no magic pill that can fix your arm.  But there are things you can do to start your injury mending, and not get hurt while you get stronger.|`|0JE41mXsaa	You do understand that CELIBACY is also a lifestyle choice?  (i.e. no relations of a sexual nature with anyone)<br>  <br>  That you have an option and do not HAVE to be with women.

And we are then a triune person. Person with 3 parts. A spirit, soul & body.<br>  <br>  Now God talks to us through our spirit. And that is that God speaks to us through our heart faith or our heart ears. But our heart ears need to be open to Gods voice.<br>  Our soul is in the middle. And our soul is our mental reasoning & so chooses to listen to Gods direction to our heart (that is born of Gods Spirit) Or our soul (mental reasoning) chooses to listen to our flesh. Now many times, if we aren't renewing our mind in Gods Word. Or not praying to God in spirit & in truth; Our flesh can speak louder than the voice of God. It depends on if we have been practicing listening to God & His written Word...<br>  As we learn to listen to Gods voice to our heart & then Gods voice gets louder. But if we instead listen to the voice to our flesh lusts, then we will reason it is OK to lust after those other women...<br>  <br>  Throw the pornography in the garbage & read the Bible. Pray to God about it. The spiritual soul of you needs to tune in to Gods leading. As a Christian, we are suppose to die to the destructive lusts of the flesh & make the soul choice to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  As a man, you should ask God for that perfect someone. Get married. Since you are saving yourself for that perfect someone.<br>  Be specific to God for that perfect woman. Remember that God first told Adam, to be fruitful & multiply. That a man shall leave his parents & find a wife & they two shall become one flesh.<br>  <br>  <br>  Love is everlasting. Intimacy is a form of love. And so sex is very intimate. Purposed for a husband & wife to share. And that sex according to Gods way is every intimate. Even to become spiritual soul mates. And love is everlasting rewards. So? There has to be sex (the right kind) in heaven. Certainly not destructive flesh lust sex. Since flesh & blood doesn't go to heaven.

True when your solitary, you can do as you please.  But with a truly connected group, you have the opportunity to learn from others and see how different dynamics work.<br>  There are lots of wanna-be's out there however.  I suggest before you go looking for a group, take a really good assessment of what you are truly looking for.  It it to learn from a true practitioner?   Is it companionship with like minded people?  Figure that out first and then search for it.  It will save you a lot of heart ache later.  One last thing, find out where they got their training and how long they studied to get to where they are.  There are a whole lot of self initiated/self proclaimed High Priests and Priestesses out there that are absolute frauds.  Beware.  To become a 3rd degree in a true traditional Wicca coven takes at least 5 years on the average.  To even be initiated usually takes a year and a day traditionally.  But the wisdom and knowledge you'll get will blow most people away.  Ask to learn "the Keys" to the spells.  They are the science behind spell work.  If they don't know what your talking about.

Warm water works best and should be mixed thoroughly before proceeding to the next step. <br>  Step TwoCombine corn syrup 1 tablespoon at a time into your mix until you have the desired consistency. Real blood is slightly thicker than water and readily drips when splattered across any surface. <br>  Step ThreeAdd food coloring sparingly until you have achieved a deep brownish-red appearance. Adding green coloring darkens the blood, while red brightens it. <br>  Step FourMix your ingredients well and let them settle for a few minutes. The longer the fake blood sits, the more it will settle to the bottom, just like the real stuff! <br>  Step FiveSkim off the scum or residue that appears on top with a spoon or paper towel. <br>  Step SixTest your blood’s consistency. If it appears too runny, add another teaspoon of corn starch and remix. Conversely, if it is too thick, add small amounts of hand sanitizer, knowing that the blood will no longer be edible.<br>  <br>  Fake Blood recipe 2<br>  What You Need:<br>  1 c (250mL) peanut butter<br>  1 qt.

Also no woman should be permitted to have more than two children in a lifetime.  The government should enforce militia law that dictates a woman must have her tubes tide after her second pregnancy, and men that are fathers to two children must have a state funded vasectomy.

The book is called "The Mystery of Iniquity" by Michael Rood. You can buy the book from www.michaelroodministries.com. The book talks about legal prerequisites to the return of the Messiah, and also comes with a free DVD called "Zechariah's Thermonuclear War". I strongly recommend that you get this book.

Luke 21:20-24 inclusive is Jesus teaching about the destruction of Jersualem. (further supported by Matt 24:15-21 and Mark 13:14-19)  It is very important not to pluck one verse out of several and try to isolate it and/or its meaning.  You must keep the scripture in proper context Lukes teaching in chapter 21 are v1-4 the widows mite; v5-7 Disciples ask two question; v8-19 signs of Christ's coming; v20-24 destruction of Jerusalem; v25-28 second coming; v29-33 Parable of the fig tree; v34-38 warning to watch for His coming.  <br>  It is not proper Bible study principals to isolate the one verse and create an expose like you have here.

These and other questions like them have consumed many a curious biped through out the course of history.<br>                It was not until the dawn of the age of information and the birth of the great question answering on-line forum that we could add to that the thirty or so useless questions a minute here that are either;<br>  <br>   A) A complete waste of time because some of the questioners/answerers are either immature or insincere and post rubbish to amuse themselves <br>  <br>  B) Easily answered with a little research into the subject <br>  <br>       The result is that anyone's question is a "crap shoot" at best, no matter how silly or serious you consider it, or in fact, it may be.

4r6d8Aieaa	Through my extensive investigation of pediatric nursing, I have obtained valuable information and learned many things about this occupation. There are so many different courses of study in which pediatric nurses can specialize . <br>   <br>  Before doing  this research I had some knowledge of a nurse′s responsibilities, but now I have a deeper insight into what is required of a person in this field.  There are sacrifices one must make, including spending long hours devoted to work, and spending less time with family, not to mention additional duties in the event of emergencies. To me, pediatric nurses are heroes saving the lives of all children.
Bb6fQtl0aa	The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.|`|zBqt99avaa	inshallah|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	ok|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  lol @ one umma......<br>  <br>  that's my line, give it back :@<br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  really, is this really hard to understand?<br>  <br>  we do't need to BELIEVE in the same thing.......<br>  ......we should WANT the same thing<br>  <br>  ..........and we should want UNITY..........<br>  <br>  <br>  but as they usually say<br>  <br>  "oh no, how can we unite with Shias who curse the people who killed Imam Hussain (as)?"<br>  <br>  whaaaaaaat?<br>  <br>  what's some one problem when we curse those who killed the ahl-ul-bait???????<br>  <br>  do you support what they did?<br>  <br>  <br>  as i said..........<br>  <br>  want the same thing...................<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|KNV7oPr3aa	its not a sunni shia thing|`|n49i9t6paa	no it wont!|`|NlQhkgFCaa	InshaAllah soon|`|nWB0NC9Iaa	Salam alkum<br>  <br>  It will only stop when they realize they have been taking the wrong path.

Your body in 10 years will not be able to compete with women who do not age.<br>  <br>  Now tell me that is good for a relationship.<br>  <br>  God has said that to lust in your mind is to commit adultery, why? Because your mind betrays where your heart is and if his mind is in a video with girls who are always willing and never age then his heart is not with you.<br>  <br>  Porn of any sort, book, video or online is destructive for any relationship.|`|mimykKnhaa	No, it is totally normal. I watch porn, so does my fiance. We still love each other, and desire each other no less.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	God places a man and a woman together in marriage for life.  That means the only one that he/she is to look at sexually or to have a sexual relationship with is his/her spouse.  If a man is watching porn, no matter the reason they give, is wrong.  A man should never need to look at another woman in a sexual way- even if they never have sexual intercourse with them.  Sex is to be between and husband and wife.  If my husband watched porn, I would think I was not enough. It is sin, no matter how wonderful your sexual relationship is with your spouse.  And remember it also degrades women.|`|AA11058044	There are many ways in which porn can be very helpful to a relationship - helping to spark a rich fantasy life; pointers and ideas to try out; part of foreplay; keeping someone from straying to a live partner; providing an outlet for sexual tension when a partner doesn't have the same level of sex drive, etc.<br>  <br>  There are also many ways in which porn can be damaging to a relationship - taking the place of human relationships; warping expectations of what is acceptable activity in a relationship; creating unrealistic goals or standards of male anatomy; becoming an obsesssion in and of itself. <br>  <br>  There's no one answer that fits everyone.  In some cases, and for some relationships it's fine, and for others it can become a huge problem.<br>  <br>  Much like alcohol, it's not the porn or alcohol that's necessarily the problem, it's how the people using it react to using it.  Some people can handle it, some can't.|`|xNaN3VkJaa	I think it is bad for the relationship in that, in many cases, (no sweeping generalizations allowed on R&S) he is not taking his wife's feelings into account. Now the wife may be into it too, i understand that. But if she's not, he may not realize that women may feel a need to compete with these ladies. That they need to look like that, or perform like that or whatever. I think sex is best left only between a man and his wife. That's it.

Porn is visual stimulation.  Some women are turned on by porn as well.  Some women aren't turned on by porn but do not see it as harmful.  Some women are turned off by it.  The affect porn has on a relationship is totally up to how both partners respond to porn.  A man watching porn is not necessarily due to not being satisfied by their partner.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Men are naturally attracted and interested in images about sex.  Some men more so than others.  Just like some guys like cars, and others don't.  That doesn't make looking at photos of cars, or women, wrong.<br>  <br>  Many women do not enjoy porn, in fact, it makes them feel uncomfortable - seeing it, thinking about it, or knowing you like it.<br>  <br>  Think how a vegetarian feels when you are talking about how you love prime-rib.  The vegetarian's emotions of disgust are understandable, and your loving prime-rib is understandable - there is no right or wrong with meat, cars, and pornography.<br>  <br>  So, just like a couple has to deal with feelings about raising kids, where to live, where to vacation, how to handle unequal sexual desires, so they have to come up with an agreement THAT WORKS FOR THEM regarding pornography.<br>  <br>  There is no RIGHt or WRONG - you guys  make up your own rules, and then change them if they don't work, and then change them again, and talk, and change, and talk. <br>  <br>  Remember, the reason we talk about our disagreements (in a relationship) is not to decide who is right, but to work towards a solution (it may take months or years) that works for both of you.|`|AA10096992	It depends. If he watches porn in lieu of sex with his mate, yes, it is bad. <br>  <br>  If it doesn't interfere with a healthy sex life, there's nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  No, it does not mean he is the least bit unsatisfied with you.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Not necessarily.

Porn adds nothing to your relationship (reading and learning from non-porn sources is a very good thing to do).|`|NUGErTlzaa	My boyfriend watches porn.  I actually never even knew he did, but one day I was cleaning our bedroom and accidentally found it.  At first, I was kind of shocked, but then eventually calmed down.  He is a very loving, caring and loyal man to me and our sex life is very healthy, but I can not be there every time he is in the "mood" to satisfy his needs, and frankly, sometimes I'm tired!  lol.  <br>  <br>  Fantasizing and watching porno is healthy and natural, as long as it doesn't reach the point of addiction.  If a man starts choosing his porn, over you, then I would say there is a problem, but if he does it, on his own, every so often, I do not think there is a problem with it.  It is natural to feel physical - mind you, not emotional - attraction for other women and men, but that doesn't mean a good man or woman will act on that impulse.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Porn is always a controversial subject to discuss among couples.  It's something that's left to people that are open minded.  Women also watch porn but don't admit to it as often as men.  <br>  <br>  Watching porn has to with with something we call having a fantasy.  There are some things that men or women are not willing to do with their partners for fear of being misunderstood.  There's always some respect and for that reason people leave fantasies just to their imagination.  Sometimes porn can be an outlet for that.  You can imagine being and doing something with someone else without actually doing it.  There is no harm in that.  So if your partner doesn't satisfy you and you don't want to hurt their feelings, you may just watch some porn to satisfy those needs.  <br>  <br>  If a human being is not allowed access to satisfy those needs with something as harmless as porn, then that person may stray and do it with someone else.  That could be a real problem.  You may wish to discuss this subject without being judgmental and could come to some understanding.  Spicing things up in your relationship may also help to get your partner to lose interest in porn if that's what you want.|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	I consider watching porn, cheating.

Afro centrists often attempt to portray the Nubians as the above peoples against anthroppological measurements and DNA testing(haploid markers).I know I will get the usual thumbs down from people who can NOT provide any scientific proof to the contrary.Genetic flow indicates a flux out of, and, into Africa. <br>  <br>  Because peoples originate in Africa, does NOT mean they were Black.Two forms of Homo sapiens(modern humans are a subclassification, Homo sapiens sapiens), both extinct, existed at the same time-Idaltu(had N*egroid/Black features), and, Cro Magnon (had Caucasoid/White features).Personally, I still favor the old theory, that the ethnicities had different origins at the same time, otherwise, the ethnicities all would have shown gradual changes instead of clearly different ethnicities whom show some overlapping of ethnicities/characteristics.|`|Z2NlyWeYaa	wait a second.... if the romans were african then surely all of the countries they invaded would be part african in heritage. So what you're saying is that white americans... who mostly originate from the UK... which was once ruled by the romans... are of african origin - so are not actually white?|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i am greek and italian and ur theories are totally redicilous<br>  when Greece was invaded by africans??lmao<br>  this black lame dude says socrates statues look black??lmao<br>  WTF I AM SEEING IN THIS AMERICAN FORUM GOD HELP LMAO|`|CvSKPHiqaa	what are you trying to prove?|`|lF65kGdyaa	If you study hieroglyphics at all you will see (visually) that there were a large variety of races involved at every level of Egyptian society, during the time of these ancient inscriptions. It is not believed that African blood was mixed with Roman blood until the end of the Roman empire when various tribes (which eventually included the Moors) sacked parts of the empire. The Moors have been attributed to the African blood linage to be found in those of southern Italy, or that region now known as Sicily.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I understand that the Egyptians, like most people, were of mixed race.  However, the origins of humanity go back to AFrica, so they say, and if that is correct then we are all of African descent, if you go far enough back.  What of it?|`|ohUm00RYaa	Yup ancient greece was invaded by african who set up most of what ancient greece know.<br>  <br>  Don't you ever wonder why statues of socrates look black?|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	LOL. "they were African". Egypt,Greeks are STILL AFRICAN. people say the "Middle East" is not in Africa but it is also a part of Africa. The media is a B****.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	not this again....|`|fpyLWbVxaa	What are you talking about?
QsPwh6xtaa	good  for you and your church :)......all i have to say is dont stop getting the word out the lord said to get his word out to the high ways and hedges...so basicallly everywhere....just go to another mall & try again :)|`|89MKzLl3aa	There are solicitation laws. For example, some neighborhoods don't allow people to go in and advertise businesses by leaving flyers.|`|JUviY9hoaa	My guess would be you annoyed the mall patrons trying to shove religion down their throat when they were shopping... <br>  <br>  It would annoy me.|`|GGUDvicaaa	Yes, you have freedom of speech. If you don′t attack people, everything should be okay. However there lays a problem: "Only Jesus saves you from sin and Hell " IS sort of attack and although it′s your opinion, it may irritate people.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The mall is private property.  The restrictions on government in the First and Fourteenth amendments to the U.S. constitution do not apply to private enterprises.  Next time, get permission.  You would not want Muslims to set up shop in your front lawn to spread their message, would you?|`|2ogimlBxaa	You have to get a permit to preach at those kinds of places.<br>  <br>  It also depends on if your preaching was disturbing the peace.|`|AA12383652	You dont have freedom of speech on private property.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	Yes but a lot of Christians can be forceful with preaching.  Its good with evangelizing but when you push religion on some ppl they just snap back and act out in ways they think r appropriate to deal with the matter.  But remember the beatitude in Matthew ch.5 :10-11 I think<br>  <br>   "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, <br>        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <br>   "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.|`|wM7pprr1aa	Free speech and other constitutional rights apply to protecting you from government censorship, private property, such as malls, are not public forums, and can limit your rights as they see fit, provided they do not attempt to limit your rights beyond their property.  Had you peacably left the mall, and preached in the streets on public property, and they tried to stop you there, /that/ would have been a violation of your rights.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	You have a right to practice your free speech.  Just not on private property without the permission of the owner.<br>  <br>  The mall is private property, the owner disallowed it.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Freedom of speech does not grant you the right to interfere with the conduct of others nor does it grant you the right to go to any place and speak.|`|B667elmWaa	It depends on what you were saying. There is no such thing as total free speach. It comes with responsibilities to fellow humans - Christian or otherwise. If you tell a non Christian they are going to hell it can be highly offensive.|`|eLbrMleWaa	I would be annoyed if I was trying to shop and I heard bible stuff...<br>  <br>  Why don't you just keep it in church.|`|syO08G5Daa	You need the malls permission|`|5nbwhB29aa	Yes, you have free speech, but the mall is privately owned and therefore can ask you to leave for violating its rules. Just like a club or business can enforce a dress code or a person can ask you to get off of his or her property...|`|hMtwZ0Sjaa	Yup. You probably annoyed enough people into requesting that you be removed. <br>  <br>  And yes, the mall owner does have a right to remove you from his/her property, and no, doing so is not a violation of your free speech.|`|aSyHNzKZaa	No, we ( Christians)  don't have it anymore . But everyone else does .
7wqIJbPjaa	i agree with you, i think it's a different attraction. like the way i hear my best guy friends talk about girls, actually when i hear what they say it makes me glad i'm gay haha, but yeah, it seems like were looking for way different qualities and aspects in a girl.|`|eybHcHz9aa	Nope. <br>  I'm bisexual, and it feels the same. ie, different for each and every person, because of the personality.<br>  <br>  Though all the crush feelings are the same and the things I look for are also the same.|`|vzbv0YADaa	It's definitely different.  A lesbian (unless she's very masculine) often loves women the same way straight women love men, if that makes any sense.<br>  <br>  Also, a lesbian sometimes wants to be the woman she's attracted to instead of just wanting her as a man would.<br>  <br>  For me, there is an additional aspect: I think of the female form as just the way people are supposed to look, the way I imagine people in all-white towns think of humanity as white.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	Yes. Of course lesbians like girls in a completely different way from straight guys.<br>  <br>  Guys have male equipment, male egos and testerostone.<br>  <br>  Lesbians have female egos, estrogen, boobs, vagina and clit.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No, i just think every attraction for every person is different. That must just be your type of person :P I wouldn't worry about it :)<br>  Good for you making friends at the club, its great when you can fit in...i wish i had at 16 :(
lcj1AKt1aa	Touch all the corners of the house and plead the blood of Jesus. Just say, 'in the name of Jesus' all the time.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	demons and evil spirits can make you sick<br>  <br>  you probably have alot of good spirits there too trying to fight off the bad ones<br>  burn sage and say that only the good spirits are welcome to stay <br>  anything dark and evil are not welcome|`|xYacZrTLaa	not that i know of don't worry about it its probably your imagination i had the same problem the sink came on by itself in my moms bathroom and it scared me so bad but it was just cause the plumbing was f***ed up its probably just a normal house problem don't worry and about the "ghost" it is probably just your imagination go et your eyes checked out (not being sarcastic) make sure you are not seeing things handle it delicately-GOOD LUCK|`|2eGgbhVoaa	I don't think they can make you sick. They do not have the ability to take the life of the living. However, unhappy spirits can scare you a good deal. Maybe you should tell them to go away...worked for me when I was a child. Or do some research into house and what was there before. Try and understand why there is a presence there.<br>  <br>  If the problem persists I suggest you see a medium or an exorcist. I feel for you.|`|7awb0wgWaa	I heard of that **** before.<br>  Just pretend its halloween and scare htem back!<br>  No jk. Call a priest or a monk. in worst case scenario, move out.<br>  also u could research teh house. maybe its some historical place where there wa a bloodbath! then u should really move out.|`|c2uywBsIaa	Yes they can make you ill. They can make room temp drop and they also can make rooms smell like roses or like s hit.<br>  Watch Paranormal State on A&E thay will answer some of your questions.|`|OAyoP4xHaa	Yes.<br>  I've seen and heard some weird things in my home as well.<br>  Things like hearing walking back and forth when no one is upstairs.<br>  Low moaning sometimes.<br>  I used to be scared so bad, I was about to move out.<br>  I was just fed up one day and asked "whoever" it was to stop. It was making me upcomfortable and I wasn't there to hurt him or anything.<br>  I haven't had a problem since.<br>  Somtimes I hear it now and again, but there is definately a layer of peace over our home now.|`|Z5736pbqaa	Juat stay calm. My friends mom gets the same thing. Try not to panic and if its really getting to you then get a phycic to visit.|`|4d20446491a7a798682c4161206db004aa	Call Ghostbusters!|`|nqQXdMIwaa	idk try looking up sites that have ideas also try calling in a priest to bless ur house.|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	ooohh ghosts carry aids, you should really get outta there right now!!!|`|hzFCefhtaa	pray to god.and trust him
YseYDxxaaa	It's never 'easy' to know how to handle situations like this. <br>  <br>  Just let them know that you are truly sorry and let your friend know that you love her. If you have anything nice about her dad that you remember, I would let her know about it, and let her know he made a difference in your life, too. Your presence will make a difference. When you get there, greet and hug your friend and then either shake hands or hug her family. It's usually expected that you step up to the casket and pay respects (if that's something you can handle) aside from that, just be there. Make sure your friend has tissues if she needs them, and just find a spot to sit quietly. It's nice to dress up a bit, but not in something that will draw a lot of attention. Some black dress pants and a dark button up shirt or a nice sweater will do. Dress shoes are good, too. You don't have to stay very long, maybe 20-30 minutes. While this time is hard for your friend, she will really need you in the weeks to come. Call and check on her. Ask her if she wants to hang out or watch a movie. Maybe take her favorite snack and be there to just listen. Knowing that you care will mean so much to your friend and her family.|`|AA11625640	Dress modestly. It you want to share a memory of your friend's dad, that would be appropriate. Be calm, avoid cliches like I know what you are going through, or it will get easier. Also, don't talk about other people who have passed on. It is okay to blend into the background and just be there in case your friend needs you for a hug. If you will be more comfortable, bring your parents, you may be emotional and they might be a help.|`|ZATeGhkbaa	Just get drunk and say what great person they where,|`|u4liwDhAaa	Let the family know that you are sorry for their loss.  Let them know you will miss him too.<br>  <br>  Behave in a quiet, respectful manner.<br>  <br>  Wear a nice dress.  If you don't have a dress, wear a nice pants outfit or nice skirt and blouse.<br>   <br>  Staying will depend on the mood of the group gathered.  You will probably be going to the funeral then out to the cemetery.  Usually there is a gathering after this.  Depending on how your friend is getting along, I think if you stay about an hour you'll be fine. <br>  <br>  I would "lay low".  Since you didn't mention how her father died, it's best to be quiet and respectful.|`|lUO6wLGAaa	Dress nicely, as if you were going to a fancy restaurant.  (No jeans, t-shirts, etc.)  <br>  <br>  You won't have to say too much.  You're mainly there to be a friend to her, and to others in the family.  Just say that you were very sorry to hear of his passing.  You've known him for a long time, so if you want, you can say something like how he was always very nice to you, or that you remember the time he took you both to the amusement park or whatever.  Mostly, though, you just want to tell your friend that you're really sorry that he's gone, and that if there's anything you can do, just say the word.<br>  <br>  Also, you'll probably be introduced to some other family members.  Realize that they're hurting too, just like your friend is.  Be very polite, and say you're sorry for their loss.  <br>  <br>  Cheering them up really isn't possible, although it's very nice of you to want to say that.  Just be respectful, and let them know that you care about them.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Follow her lead.  Probably shouldn't try to cheer her up.  You should give her a hug and tell her how sorry you are.  Depending how close you were with her dad, say something nice about him.  She'll probably have lots of people there, so if it's the wake where people are eating (and not the funeral home viewing) I think once you visit and eat some food, maybe 45 minutes or an hour would be acceptable time to stay.  If you're just going to the funeral home viewing, 15-30 minutes is fine.<br>  <br>  Clothes:  A dress or a skirt and blouse.  No bright colors.|`|vd2ExGEraa	well, if people are crying try to say encouraging words. if their not you dont have to really say anything. Umm..well this one is hard, act very sad i guess look people straight in the eye. dress very modestly. 45-60 min is a good time. do both (lay low AND be cheerful)                <br>                                                          <br>  <br>      I hope i helped a little bit and im terribly sorry|`|C59bTKO2aa	Depending on what part of the country you are in there are 2 kinds of wakes.  The first kind is held at the funeral home or sometimes a church; and the casket or urn is there.  You walk to the casket and if it's open, you view the body.  If this is something you aren't comfortable with, then look at the lining of the open lid and don't lower your eyes.  Bow your head, say a short prayer (15 sec) and as you are turning away look to see where the family is seated, usually right up front or in a small area to the side.  Walk up to your friend first, if she is standing give her a hug, if she's sitting then take her hands in yours and tell how sorry you are and how much you admired her dad.  Go up to each family member, introduce yourself to the ones you don't know, and tell each one you are sorry.  Once you have spoken to everyone, go back to your friend and tell her you are leaving and that you will see her at the funeral (if you are going).  In rural areas, sometimes the male relatives will sit with the body all night (that's what wake means, they stay to make sure the deceased person isn't in a fugue state and doesn't wake up alone and closed inside a casket).<br>  <br>  The second kind of wake is held in someone's home or a hall.  The body is not present and food is served.  The family is usually moving around the room talking to different people. Do the same as before, offer each family member your condolences starting with your friend.  Also ask her if you can get her a plate, she might have forgotten to eat.  Sit with your friend for awhile if no one is with her.  Ask her how she is holding up, then let her talk about anything she wants.  If she is surrounded by family and doesn't need you right then, it's okay to leave after a 1/2 hour.<br>  <br>  Wear a simple dress, subdued colors and no loud jewelry.
OsY0lmTCaa	I don't think anything about gay people. I think things about individuals. Some gay individuals are very cool and some are right rectums! <br>  <br>  Each person is unique and should be taken that way.|`|1hS27eJuaa	I don't judge anyone as a whole group.|`|Vo6YukG2aa	I thinkkkkkk (as you like to add many K's) they are awesome.<br>  I wish I knew more of em .|`|csFp83i1aa	i dont mind being around them but i dont think what they are doing is right. i am not going to just not talk to them because of that but i will let them know i dont agree with that and no one is born gay you make that decision yourself so i mean i am okay around gay and lesbians but i just prefer they werent gay or lesbain|`|7wqIJbPjaa	i like emm. :]<br>  <br>  they make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside lol.|`|58eHufb3aa	WERE ULTRAFABULOUS AND u know it!!!<<<3333333333<br>  <br>  No honestly, we tend to not judge other peoplezzz.........|`|DWwv3v9Raa	People are people, sexual orientation doesn't matter, they have all the same responsibilities as everyone else, they have to work to supply their needs.|`|MJ5juxzpaa	they're nice people :]]<br>  some can be cold blooded bitches but thats from my own experiences i like lesbians they're fun and str8 women too ;)))<br>  and some str8 men that arent ignorant :]]]|`|a6wPnHRQaa	I think I'm pretty cool too!!!|`|QkfGYIcxaa	im indifferent|`|k1c8jCm6aa	They are like any other person =P.|`|j27SONW9aa	Since im gay...i "thinkk" they are swell<br>  <br>  lol:)|`|AA11164025	haha i agree with brandon|`|DTmNYgiKaa	eh i stay away from them|`|7kAN5zqWaa	I'm all for them

But you can only know if you ask. GO up to her one day and tell her your true feelings. I'm sure you guys can be girlfriends.
7n2ozGooaa	Firstly, you are soo mature for your age, it's great to see a youngin' concerned and aware of what's going on in society.<br>  <br>  I'm a mum, still in my 20's, but truly feel what your saying... The media is getting worse and gone are the days where kids were more innocent and just enjoyed life, life without mobile phones, life without iPods, life without the internet....<br>  <br>  I'm concerned what my son will grow up to be like, whether he decides to go with the crowd or stand up for his rights and just "live"... But then, with so much temptation around, I cannot always protect him from what's to come... He still needs to experience life in it's fullest to be able to learn and to live... You can only do so much as a parent... I mean, you only learn from your mistakes - This saying is soo true... it makes you a stronger person.<br>  <br>  There's nothing you can do about the changing times... Time will change if you like it or not. By the time you become a parent, times will probably be worse than today, but then again, it could be better... we will never know till that day comes....Just stay strong, be there for your family, be true to yourself and always put God 1st :)

19QSiNqgaa	probably not true, a lot of gay activists have been " claiming" every unmarried famous man in history in an attempt to convince the world that if a good thing happened and an unmarried man was involved " he was gay" other examples of "retroactive outing " are Michelangelo, da vinci and there have even been attempt to convince us that Jesus was gay"because he hung around with guys most of the time. and the bible never says anything about him porking a chick,."|`|qbb9YiRsaa	I can't find anything that says that.
