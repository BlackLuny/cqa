My boyfriend was in a rush to get to work, and so he parked in a handicap area, and put up his old handicap sign on his mirror...(he has surgery 2 years ago, and he changed the date on the sign and put it up on his rear view mirror) well, when he got out of work, he saw a ticket on his window that said "Alterted handicap ticket" i guess the cop recognized that he had changed it. how serious is this offense? he will have to go to court, but is there any serious punishment that he could face? the past year he has been on probabtion due to a ticket he had gotten, and instead of putting points on his record, the judge told him that he is on probabtion for one year, and during that one year he is not allowed to get any ticket...so with this handicap sign issue, he broke his probabtion...so OVERALL story, what is he looking at, and how serious is it? I would really appreciate any real help, I am a little worried about him.. thank you.

He has failed at everything he has touched. Made his father finally proud of him when he was appointed president by the US courts. Won the second time only because the opposition had nothing to offer the Americans. I think Mickey Mouse could have beat him. I guess John Kerry was donald duck. Anyway the question for all you conservatives is why is his family leaving him? His brother, his daughters and now his wife? His old ***** mother is the only one behind him. Well she better be there for him when his is unemployed and a single parent. Nobody in there right minds will pay to here him speak or buy any of his books. That's if he can find a publisher.

Well what happened then, is that in the whole proses they went to his room and found my friends weed, money, scale, grow box, about 2 ounces of weed, and about $2000 in cash, which they confiscated. That money wasn't even drug money, that was his pay from work. Basically he short with money now, and he got no weed to smoke, his broke. All this because the feds made a mistake. He did not get arrested since they could not get an approval for an arrest warrant. I mean the whole thing was ****** up, his right were violated, he did not let them go inside, they simply broke down the door, the whole thing just makes me angry.

I know with the news nowadays i do not agree with my son for getting the knife in the first place, and i do sympathise with anyone who has just lost a dear one through knife crime.      my 15yr old son was able to get a knife from school because some boys were after him, knife was later found on him by a tutor and the police was informed, this happened in june 2008. we just attended the police station for an interview and was later told that he will be charged with having a knife at school. we are attending a youth court next week. Can anyone advice me on what might be the outcome either conviction or any youth referal. Can u be convicted for holding a knife if when it happened when u were only just 16.

There was a town crier and a night watchman who watched over the communities from a tower, and when they notices unlawful activity occuring, they would do a hue and cry and the whole neighborhood would get together and handle the situation on the spot.

Just because you don't like someone doe's not mean that you don't be a man and look them in the eye. If McCain thinks he can deal with the world the way he has dealt with senators in his 26 years he is sadly mistaking. Their are many cultures that see it as a sign of disrespect when you don't look at them when addressing them.  McCain is a bitter man. He is desperate for the presidency as it would be the final feather in his cap of accomplishments or lack their of. Keep in mind this is not his first rodeo. McCain appears to exude hate is he capable of being over people without being a tyrant I don't think so.

I was at school today, and to get off campus at lunch you need to have your ID, because only Seniors are allowed to leave. I left it at home. When I get up to the guy who was checking he made me turn around and go get proof even though I showed him 12th grade books and last year's ID that was in my car. I was a little flustered as now I was going to be late, but I turned around. There was a barrier so picture it like a U-turn at a stoplight. The speed limit is 25, I was going no faster than 15 but when I turned around my tires spun and squealed and left a little maybe a one foot skid mark. Sure I was going faster than I should have, but it was in no way reckless, and my car has an extremely low center of gravity, about five inch ground clearance so its not like my car was tipping over or anything.      I get my schedule, go back, and then the guy (no police affiliation, just like a "campus supervisor") parked his golf cart in front of me, wrote down my plates, and said that I would be getting pulled out of class tomorrow to get my reckless driving ticket and meet with the Vice Principal.      I said spinning tires isn't reckless driving or exhibition of speed (keep in mind I'm going less than 15 mph, but I really am not sure if it is or not I just said that) and that even it was, can you legally give me any sort of ticket? He looked a little angry and just shook his head and didn't say anything. And because I was a little angry floored it just to show my disapproval, but again not breaking the speed limit, just letting my exhaust rumble a bit.

I sometimes wonder how many they would get without it.       I also wonder how anti-abortionists think its ok to allow the death penalty. Sounds kind of hypocritical to me.      And if you are against the death penalty then you have a funny way of showing it by voting Republican. I don't think Jesus supports the death penalty. I don't think Jesus would support most Republican ideology outside of abortion.      Isn't that interesting? The Christians vote for a party that goes against most of the Bible's teachings outside of abortion. YET, they vote against the party that follows most of the bibles teachings outside of abortion.      I have to keep reminding myself that there Truly is NO limit to how stupid people can be.

20090305074039AAAeX0j	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Are some Americans willing to have a decreased standard of living just to make sure "the rich" pay more?	Many economists say raising taxes on income and investment drags the whole economy down.  And when Charlie Gibson told Obama that lower taxes sometimes increase revenue, Obama responded that "fairness" was also a goal.      So, do some people want to decrease the size of the economy for all, in order to also decrease "inequality?"  Or would an attempt to institute "fairness" not be implemented if it would shrink the economic pie for all?      What does Obama think?  What does the American public think?

Ok so I got Liberalism zings and need some conservative ones, I know they are out there, maybe you could help a sista out. Here are a few examples for the Liberalism 101   ? We are anti-God. We believe everyone should have the right to sin and experiment with sin. We do not believe that God should judge us. We don't believe in consequences or actions as long as we can blame someone else.      ? Liberals tax fairness is just like their political correctness and their fairness doctrine for the media. Liberals don't want fairness; they want it all...as long as it yours and not theirs things are not fair.       ? We are anti-Family. We don't believe in the husband and wife family. We believe that every household should be a single-parent household and that single-parent should be married to the gov't.      ? We believe in liberal education. No test, no scale of pass or fail. You pass if you believe in gays rights, abortion, anti-God and anti-democracy. If you are unable to get into college it isn't your fault it is because of your race or gender.       ? Truth is just an obstacle to overcome    ? We are pro-civil rights as long as they are the rights of minorities, gays and foreigners.            SO what about conservatives?? I need like 10 good ones THANKS!!!!!

A recruiter gives them a big story and they believe it all then go to war and get killed. Kids at this age don't have enough experience in life to know what they want to do or know how to do anything yet so these recruiters feed them a line about their future and they believe it. Maybe they should start a training program for 18 years old kids (like an after school extra curricular activity if they are still in school), few times a week until they turn 21. By then, those who don't really want to join would have dropped out, and those who remained would be more experienced and educated. Why can you fight for your country at 18 but can't drink a beer until you are 21?

20090305072807AAW1yrM	Politics & Government;Politics	Social democracy does WORKS. Communism DOES NOT!?	They're not the same thing!       I am a Social Democrat and here is how I think things should be. Tell me what you think.       How a Social Democratic System works.    ? A mixed economy consisting of both private enterprise and government-owned or subsidized programs of education, health care, child care and related social services for all citizens.   ? An extensive system of social security (although not to the extent advocated by socialists), with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the citizens against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement.   ? Government bodies that regulate big business enterprise in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labor rights (i.e. supporting worker access to trade unions), consumer protections, and fair market competition.   ? Environmentalism and environmental protection laws; for example, funding for alternative energy resources and laws designed to combat global warming.   ? A value-added/progressive taxation system to fund government expenditures.   ? A secular and progressive social policy, although this varies markedly in degree.   ? Immigration and multiculturalism.   ? Fair trade over free trade.   ? A foreign policy supporting the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights and where possible, effective multilateralism.   ? Advocacy of social justice, human rights, social rights, civil rights and civil liberties.      ? Social democratic policies actually enhance individual rights by raising the standard of living of the great majority of the population, increasing social mobility, raising the power of workers and consumers in society.   ? The unregulated market that fiscal conservatives advocate is incapable of addressing global poverty and inequality in an equitable way.   ? Social democracy stabilizes economic conditions by providing economic security to individuals and eliminating the threat of extreme poverty.   ? The argument that social democratic governments spend too much and run up deficits is undermined by the record of conservative administrations (e.g. in the United States and the United Kingdom) which have run up unprecedented deficits.   ? By restricting some economic rights, social democracy makes the market more fair (for small businesses and consumers, for example).

When asked if the move means Fox will no longer report news, the spokesperson assured Fox will continue to report news and will replace the reporting staff with a more cost effective but highly regarded seer of manifest signs.”      Okay, I made that newspaper article thing up, but I swear, the thing about the ‘news’ is true.      … so… my question is…      Is this or is this not among the most disgraceful violations of journalistic professionalism we have ever seen?      … and, if you’re up for it…      Is this the low or is the most shocking still to come before a new day finally dawns over this nightmare?

20090305063615AAgRK1T	Politics & Government;Elections	On voting day, when going to vote for your chosen party and they appear not to be on the list...?	.. can you walk out of the polling station, or do you HAVE to vote a party on the list eg one of the big ones like Labour or Tory's?       Just over the past year, I have been voting for a recognised party, who I agree with many of their policies eg health care, immigration, schooling etc. A leaflet was put through my door a couple of years ago before our local election, and I was interested in voting. Beforehand, I would vote for one of the larger parties with more seats eg Torys. When I went to the polling station, the party I wanted to vote for was there, so I marked X in the box and that was that.       However, when the next election is due, and I go to the polling station on the day and my chosen party is NOT marked down, am I free to leave and not vote? Do I need to explain why to the people who are behind the polling desk? Or do I HAVE to choose a party there and then.      Certainly WONT be voting for Labour! Never have and never will! :)

20090305062832AAZuvIy	Politics & Government;Government	My comment is on President Clinton’s Secretary of Labor and former Harvard Professor Robert Reich?	had the following philosophy with respect to foreign and U.S. companies and jobs. Foreign companies that build plants here in the U.S. and employ U.S. workers are as valuable to the U.S. economy as U.S. companies operating here. Furthermore, U.S. companies that build plants overseas and employ foreign workers to produce products that could be produced in the U.S. have no value to U.S. workers and the U.S. economy.       1. Answer: Reich has it right. He is smart and people can understand him. Anytime United States can produce goods that can be exported to other countries at a profit our nation will benefit. The reverse has been happening for many years with manufacturing being located overseas producing goods that are consumed in the US. This was a natural result of capitalism as the cost of foreign labor is cheaper than domestic labor.   2. Response to answer: but what about producing product for our own consumption? We can produce many things that we import.  In our text book in the early weeks they referred to China which limited the amount of companies that could do business with in its boarders protecting local companies until they joined the World Trade Organization.  They were only trying to protect their interests (even when most were government owned).  Also on page 65 tells us about Japan's "self-sufficiency'.  They have very strict import laws to support their culture.  I have to say they are looking out for their people!      Does any have any comment on response #2?

20090305080409AAMIS9s	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What are my chances of getting unemployment in PA?	Ok so last year I was fired from a job that I worked over a year at.  I moved up quickly in the company.  It was a gas station that I worked at.  I went from cashier to manager in less than 6 months.  In that 6 month time frame I missed one day of work and was late 15 minutes another time.  After missing one day and being late another they promoted me to manager.  I took the job from another guy that was the manager there but couldn't handle it so they demoted him.  After becoming manager I worked on average anywhere from 40 to 70 hours a week.  I always went in if someone called off to cover for them and was repeatedly told I was doing a great job.  The last 6 months I didn't miss a day but was late again by 30 minutes.  This happened after I worked the whole weekend.  I do mean the whole weekend with only 8 hours of down time.  That is 40 hours in 2 1/2 days.  After that they pulled me in the office and told me that I was getting fired because I was late twice.  Once before the promoted me and once after.  I didn't sign anything when I left.  They also have a warning system in place there and I never got warned once.  No verbal, no written and no final.  Just fired.  The guy who got demoted was promoted back to manager after I was fired.  I have spoken to my old boss since then and he said he made a mistake in firing me but isn't currently hiring.  The guy who replaced me even put in a good word for me at another place.  I am currently having a hard time finding a job and applied for UE.  This place is fighting it.  Do they have a chance do you think?  UE said that it sounds like I have a good case.  Apparently this place fights all of their UE claims.  Any insight would be helpful as this is new to me and I am curious.  Thanks so much.

20090305073739AATga2T	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Unions in today's workplace... Necessary?	I really want to get people's opinions on this.  But I want this to be an educated or at least sound like and educated debate.      All-too-often I am asking and debating with people over the support union's showed towards Obama during his election and what this means for Obama's support for workers unions in the upcoming years.        Recently two situations occured where worker's unions have actually threatened a friend of mine's father, and also my father for working too hard.  Basically this is how it went down both times.  My father and this other guy, on two separate jobs and occasions, were working hard, working overtime and showing a general interest in their job.  They both were working for the same large corporation, but at different times, when this happened.  Both were approached by union leaders and told that the union does not want to have to work up to their standards and their efforts so if they do not relaxe with the extra efforts they would make sure that they didn't have a job any more.        It seems to be a recurring theme, that unions are pretty much in place today to give people the opportunity to do exactly what is necessary, nothing more, showing no extra effort, and forcing those who are actually interested in their job to do less.        Another thing is this new bill that may be passed by Obama, the "Check Card", which will allow union officials to recruit people by just having them sign a card.  These cards may have no indication of the nature of the union the people are joining, they will basically be able to propose any reason to convince workers to join, and it is negating any opposition from the company the union will be forming within.      Anyone against "corporate america" and feel that america should be more about "the people", well here you go you are on your way to having everything you wanted.  But let me let you in on a few opinions.  Just doing simple math, take the number 250,000 and just say multiply it by .20 .   You get 50,000.  Now take 50,000 and multiply it by .20.  You get 10,000.  So even though the numbers aren't correct tax numbers you get an idea of how much more the top tax bracket pays towards our economy, and you get an idea of how little the lower income brackets contribute.  Now compound that with the fact that labor unions are going to make it so that corporations are going to have to pay more, have workers work less, and give more to them in terms of benefits, you are going to have large corporations ship out all their work to other countries, shut down or collapse.  Ultimately your, non-corporate america, will lead to complete economic disaster, because as much as you hate it, large corporations already keep this economy afloat.      Oh and when there are fewer large corporations to foot the taxes and less jobs in the US ultimately leading to less tax money coming into the economy, where do you think the money will eventually come from.  You america, you will all eventually feel the effects.

I own stock in a pink sheets company and the stock value, unfortunately is down to $.02. I have heard through the grapevine, that the CEO who owns 170 Million shares of the total 200 milllion shares, is considering merging with a larger private company who would like to be listed publically. The problem is, that we believe he is going to announce a merger and he will supposedly have sold his stock holding to the company for approximately $2 million, while not giving the existing public shareholders any cash, they just get to keep their stock at what it currently trades at which is only $.02!       1. I would like to know if this is legal?       2. Doesnt the CEO have to have this merger company offer the existing public shareholders the same price per share to sell?       3. Isnt the CEO required to have a shareholder meeting to discuss a corporate structural change before it happens?       4. And finally, Isnt the CEO's fiduciary responsiblity, (who is also one of only two Board members), to us as the shareholders and wouldnt he be required to conduct a shareholder vote?....even though he as the single largest shareholder would certainly pass the merger vote, but doesnt his legal responsiblity require him to notice all shareholders of a vote before this merger can just HAPPEN, and then he tells us in a press release?       THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP IN ANSWERING THIS, AS WE ARE ALL SMALL SHAREHOLDERS AND WORRIED THAT THIS CEO IS DOING THINGS ILLEGALLY AND IT WILL MAKE OUR STOCK WORTHLESS.

Although I have never exercised in my life nor do I play sports, my calves are bulky and firm due to my walking hobby when I was younger. my question is, am I the wrong mindset or are my legs really that weak? the same question for my breathing, is it just in my head or am I really grasping for air when I do? When I start getting tired, I feel like I'm taking in too much air and at the same time I feel like I'm not taking any at all. It's like I'm taking it in, but it's not going to my lungs or going where it's supposed to be. Also, I'm not sure if this would help but snot comes out of my nose after some time. it's not drooping down my nose or anything that serious, it's just a small amount to be exact that I can wipe off real quick. (I don't have Asthma)      Thanks, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

In his DEP packet, it says to bring a letter from our landlord saying how much rent we pay.  Because we don't pay any, will this affect the housing allowance to where we won't get any because we don't pay rent?  Thanks for your time.
20090305081706AA8xT9c	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Are we really giving him a chance to prove he can do what the American people wanted him to do?	This is just crazy to me. Our President has not been in office 60 days and has already come under scrutiny for what he was elected to attempt to rectify. The Bush Administration ran amuck for 8 yrs, without much questioning or doing any justifying at all, and brought the US to where we are today, hence the ensuing investigation. So why is our new President being scrutinized for trying to right the wrongs of the Bush Administration? Why is it news that Rush Limbaugh has challenged him to a debate? He is a commentator, not a politician. His opinion is just that, his opinion. At the end of the day, he doesn't have the power or probably any real desire to change everyday ordinary Americans lives...this is a great marketing ploy to boost ratings as well as an attempt to weaken the confidence of our Presidents supporters.      I know that everyone is aware of the global financial mess that we are in. It happened because of unethical and irresponsible behavior by all parties directly involved. However, we are in this mess together and have to endure this as a counrty, this is not the time to point fingers. Some feel it isn't their problem their neighbor bought a home they can no longer afford but it will become their problem if the neigbor gets foreclosed and the value of their property falls.       There is a trickle down effect in society that people seem to have forgotten. When someone suffers some misfortune, though it may not affect you directly at the time, others are affected that you might not know or see. When are we all going to get over this selfish attitude that we or our situation is more important or of more value than the next person? That is why we are where we are, everyones only concern is themselves and how they can benefit, irregardless of the consequences to others. This is the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, but a unified resolution to the problem doesn't seem likely.      The financial situation of the US is a problem our President inherited. Of course with any major issue, things get worse before they get better. Yet it is being insinuated that his actions, in the less than 60 days he has been in office, are the reason for the recent stock market plunge. That is laughable; not because the market fluctuates with the economical cycles and globally all markets are in a funk, or that it was uncertain beforehand but that people actually feel that one man can cause an entire global market to fall. If it's that easy, then Wall St. has alot bigger issues to be concerned about if u ask me.       In my personal opinion if you want to see something effectively changed, sometimes you have to modify those old ideas and ways of thinking and try something new. The American people want CHANGE, not a continuation of the same but we must also realize this is but one man, who is trying and with opposition that effort can be just that trying. We must have patience and faith in what it is we believe he can do and just give our President the chance to show and prove, not try to block him. There is uncertainty in everything so we never know the results of anything until we give it a try.

My soon to be ex husband keeps saying that he only physically assaulted me one time, yet I had him arrested and emergency protection orders done on him several times. Where would I find a copy of all of the arrests done on him?    He lives in Fresno, and the arrests were done in Fresno and Madera Counties. There is a history with this man and Police and Sheriffs in both counties.   I live 300 miles away. Is there a way to get the records on line? I have paid for searches like Inteligator.com and GovRecords.com and haven't found what I am looking for.

20090305083709AAXTq6S	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is this considered a form of workplace harassment?	Two co-workers frequently use my last name as a euphemism for screwing up, doing something stupid, etc., "You just pulled -------" or they call each other by my last name.  They do it when I'm out of earshot, but I've still heard the comments.  One is from an older male co-worker whom I don't particularly care for, and so usually steer clear of.  I'm pretty low-key and not hypersensitive, but I'm finally tired of the back-handed insults. I haven't said anything to either of these people, or to HR, because I wanted to get some opinions first on how to handle this.
20090305083800AA86VV7	Politics & Government;Politics	When will Barack Obama address the issue of bedwetting?	I know that President Obama is busy, but for many families, including mine, bedwetting is an important issue. They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I think that's because it sets the tone for your whole day. Well, the same could be said for bedwetting. When someone wakes up in a wet bed or wet absorbant night pants it sets a bad tone for the day. Not just for the bedwetter, but for the whole family. Will Barack Obama address this problem? And why isn't there more outspoken pressure for him to do so? Is it because the families of bedwetters are ashamed to lobby for this?
