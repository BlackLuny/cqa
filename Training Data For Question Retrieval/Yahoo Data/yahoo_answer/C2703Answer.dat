65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	I really like the Fresh Step multiple cat formula with carbon scoopable litter.  I have 3 cats and 3 boxes, and I've used just about every kind of litter.  I've heard good things about some of the corn or wheat-based litters but I haven't tried them due to expense.  <br>  I scoop every other day (I try to do it every day but, you know...) and dump the whole box and scrub them out about every other month or so.  As long as I don't miss more than one day of scooping, I don't notice any odor and my visitors don't notice any either, which is my main concern.  Good luck with your kitties!|`|AA10873763	I am the worst, laziest cat litter tender on the planet and I have tried everything from the most expensive to the cheapest, scoopable and not-scoopable.<br>  The best I have found is Yesterday's News.  I tried this expecting to trade "effectiveness" for "environmentally friendly" as is often the case and I was blown away.  I have two cats (used to be four) and all I do is dump it once a week.  No odor, no sticking to the bottom of the litter pan, no worries about the dogs getting into it on occassion, no accidents, nothing.<br>  I will never use anything else.  I don't know how it works, but it does, and better than Tidy-Cat or anything full of chemicals.<br>  Honestly, give it a try.  You can print a coupon from their website.|`|pve5w0zGaa	a good quality clumping litter, mixed in with a little (1 or 2 cups worth) of baking soda, plus sifting out all the droppings and urine clumps "every-day" will keep your house stink free|`|Ka3fbxszaa	I have been using Arm and Hammer Super Scoop...Great stuff. I have a house full of cats with 4 litter boxes going and feel like I finally found the right litter! It is available in a scented and unscented kind. Plus...since is is clumping I think I save money in the long run without having to dump the whole box all the time!|`|AA10356572	the best cat litter is one they all use -as a rule of thumb you should have as many litter boxes as you have cats.. ideally in more than one place.. so if you have 4 cats you might have 2 litter boxes in basement and 2 upstairs.|`|AA10892706	DEFINITELY Tidy Cat for Multiples. It's got the green color on the bag. I've had multiple cats all my life and this litter is the best.

I started using it because it was natural and better for cats, me, and environment, now I use ONLY this because it gets rid of odors like nothing else. Its the only thing that works at the fresh stuff and the stale pee odor that never seems to go away. Plus it doesn't smell like fake fragrances masking cat pee, just smells piney. I get lazy occasionally and don't change it as often as I should, and it still works.|`|tnWqBJlNaa	Honestly, it seems no matter what litter I buy, still have some lingering odor.   Some litters like the ones with activated carbon or baking soda work better, but I've always had still a problem with odor .  That is until a friend recommended a product called innofresh pet litter box odor absorbers.    It's a little activated carbon odor absorber that just clips onto the side.    I have two litter boxes and just having these clipped onto the side makes a huge difference.   The company has a pretty good blog that I've read at <a href="http://innofresh.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://innofresh.wordpress.com/</a>    Turns out they have other odor absorbers too for fridge which I also buy.<br>  They all work great and it's easy to get on line.<br>  Anyway, for litter box, these rock.|`|hGGf68GQaa	I use the tidy cats for multiple cats scoopable litter.

Have training sessions every day with her at the same time.  Put her on a leash and call her name.  Then gently pull the leash towards you (don't jerk it, that will make the whole experience unpleasant and therefore she won't want to listen).  Always use the same command, so she won't get confused.  After a while, she'll get it.  You can also use treats and that will work too!  Good luck!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Put her on a long lead, call her name and the command you want to use, if she come keep backing up with lots of praise. If she doesn't come give her a little tug and then lots of praise and treats.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Try group obedience classes, it really  helps you learn to teach your dog, plus it socializes dogs with other dogs and new people.<br>  <br>  You can also hold a small treat in your hand, call your dog, and give treat when she responds properly.   Toys might do it too if your dog likes to play ball.<br>  <br>  Then again, if you have a dachshund -----  depends on whether they've sighted prey or are in the mood to come.<br>  Actually, depends on my tone of voice, if it's casual they tend to take their time, if I sound urgent, they do respond.|`|PjTmG33Iaa	My uncle, who helps train our puppy, said to get the dog on a leash, and say "Come here" and if the dog doesn't come(this might sound mean) you have to yank the leash toward you, which with force the god near you.

Facing your dog, back up a few steps. <br>  <br>  Step3Call the dog by name, followed by the simple command "Come." (For example: "Spike, come.") <br>  <br>  Step4Reward your dog with a treat after he approaches you. <br>  <br>  Step5Slowly increase your expectations for your pup by calling him from another room. <br>  <br>  Step6Gradually move into the backyard, front yard on a long leash and so on. <br>  <br>  Step7Praise and encourage your dog as he comes to you. <br>  <br>  Step8Remember to say "good" right when the dog exhibits the behavior you want.|`|1gbR22CRaa	Call her. When she comes give her a small treat. Every time she comes when you call give her a treat. By the end of the day she'll come every time.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Giving a dog some treats works most of the time, but there are limitations to this. Try to consider this topic about basic obedience training, <a href="http://dogtime.com/basic-commands-obedience.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/basic-commands-obedie...</a>|`|D78jfOMZaa	Train her, but don't forget to give her little treats. It takes time but trust me they are very intelligent.|`|czvcEabpaa	LOL.  My lab is only 2 years younger than my daughter.  He has been trained in the ways of children. LETS GO!|`|rNmekxLcaa	Doggy treats!<br>  <br>  Food never fails.|`|zBT6Y0zgaa	if she is not responding to her name try whistling or making that kissing sound. Or i pat my leg|`|AA10638323	simple. make coming to you the most wonderful experience possible! NEVER EVER EVER call your dog to you and then punish the dog... if you where to call me over, then ***** me out, I'd be highly unlikely to come to you next time you called. <br>  <br>  Food treats work well with this, but I prefer a novel, special toy, Something that squeaks works best. With your dog in a confined area (a fenced in yard, your home) have the toy in hand, and call your dog's name and say COME. No fanfare.... simple & direct, while looking at your dog. If your dog just stares at you blankly, show the toy, shake it, make it look fun, and repeat the dog's name and COME. <br>  <br>  as soon as your dog gets up, encourage it! Say more exuberantly COM! and squeak the toy... DO NOT SAY GOOD DOG OR ANY REINFORCEMENT YET!<br>  <br>  when the dog comes all the way to you, get happy, and say loudly GOOD COME and give the dog the toy & play briefly with lots of hugs and love. then take the toy and keep it to use it ONLY to enforce the COME command. <br>  <br>  After a few days of this, begin to only use love and hugs and praise as the reward. Do this randomly, for the toy should still be used on occasion as a reward. This keeps the dog guessing "does he have the toy?? Yes? No? Oh-well, I get lovies anyways!"<br>  <br>  The trick here is consistency and using the toy as the reward. If this toy is given as a regular play toy, it looses it's "value" to the dog. <br>  <br>  Repeat this throughout the day, at random times. Before you know it , you r dog will eagerly come to you, whether you have to toy or not!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|J1i9GDGiaa	dog treats but you dont want the dog jus coming to you for food--it helps if the dog knows its name like if you scratch and rub it alot while repeating the its name the dog will be inclined to come to you for love and will respect you more rather than a tool for treats|`|I8Utxf4Vaa	Lure her in with a nice, steamy, hot, warm, delicious, amazing, super bowl of pasta.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Ahh... the song of the Siamese.  there is nothing like it ...<br>  <br>  Siamese/Orientals are famous for their vocal abilities. As you get to know your kitty and pay attention to the types of sounds she makes, you will be able to "translate" her language more easily. Also observing her body language which accompanies her "spoken" language you will be more able to "tune into" what she is telling you. ConCATulations on your new kitty!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Communication---An-Analysis-of-Feline-Body-Language&id=331749" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Communication-...</a><br>  <br>  I would assume that if you adopted her, she has been spayed already, but if not, please do make an appointment as soon as possible. A Siamese in heat is REALLY loud.. and can drive the most devoted cat lover out of the house to go see a movie <grin> for a few hours of relative quiet. <br>  <br>  Siamese and Orientals thrive on lots of attention and play. When they are feeling "neglected" they can very easily tell you in no uncertain terms that they miss you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! <br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by two Oriental Shorthair Neuters<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthair cats|`|ApG0DpzXaa	Congratulations, you adopted a baby, she has four legs and fur, but let me tell you she's special.<br>  <br>  I've had many Siamese over the years, they are not like other cats.<br>  They are more emotional, and more intelligent.  They "talk" with an amazing variety of sounds.  Some 'talk' at times that seem to make sense, they are asking for food, they are asking for a door to be opened, they are playing with another cat.  Occasionally you get a 'philosopher' who talks continually for no apparent reason.  Do not worry about her differences in sound, just don't try and train her not to talk, that would make her miserable.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	I am involved in Siamese rescue, so I've heard my share of vocal Siamese.  I've been on the phone more than once when one of mine has started howling, and have had many people ask me what on earth that awful noise was, LOL!  They have quite a bit to say, and say it in things that range from a cute squeak or chirp, all the way up to a howl that belongs in a horror movie.  So it's perfectly normal, she's not in pain, she's just part Siamese.|`|7feafcca345dc1ba46e01adef7b6e44faa	SHe may need to be spayed if it's heat realted. If she has been spayed and is just crying....be aware each cat...even withtin the same breed has different voice abilities. Some sing very, very, umm.....poorly. Siamese, and Orientals have plaintive wails....not as badly as Burmese( OH my GOODNESS!), but not as pretty and trilling as a Devon. I think perhaps you just are not used to your new singer, who is probably trying to get on American Idol. You can tell her she can't carry tune....but she'll NEVER believe you.|`|WNhjMJ2laa	Well all cats do that if they're in heat..... if not<br>  <br>  she probably wants something when my siamese makes noise he usually wants clean water or fresh food. <br>  <br>  I don't think mine meows any more than other cats he just sounds different.|`|SwIOyL0laa	That's typical of the Oriental breeds.  I have a Siamese who wanders around the house wailing, and there's nothing wrong.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Siamese are a very vocal breed.  As long as the vet has given her a clean bill of health I would guess she is fine, just vocal like shes supposed to be.  But if you haven't been to the vet since you got her, I would take her in just for a basic check up and to make sure her shots are up to date.  She also might still be adjusting.  But siamese are known for their vocalizations.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Siamese/Orientals do talk a lot and have a lot of vocalizations.  Is she spayed?  If not, it could be the talking when in heat.  If not spayed, get her in now and have her done.
L22hVXTIaa	If it is a pale yellow in color, it's supposed to be there. It acts as a lubricant to allow male dogs to extend and retrack their penis in and out of the sheath.  Now and then, it will drip.  If he had an infection, it would be a dark yellow or greenish color.  But, you can always check with the vet to be sure.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	The creamy yellowish stuff is normal. My dog had it so we took him to the vet and it is just like human precum in a weird way. Yes, I know your dog is fixed (mine is too) but thats how the vet explained it to us. Its his body getting rid of the pee that doesn't come all the way out, the stuff that doesn't make it out of his penis. She said it was nothing to worry about and he will clean himself (or in our case our female cleans it lol!)|`|hMF3kg3Baa	I would take him to the vet. Even if you think it is not hurting him, it may be. It is probably bugging him if he keeps licking it. Dogs lick wounds because it bugs them. It may be hurting.|`|5dawOJcpaa	maybe his feeling h0rny|`|gHeSO4yRaa	You should definatley call the vet AND make an appointment today,  Most vets don't like to give medical advice over the phone because of it possibly being the wrong information.  Your best bet would be to make an appt and have his "thingy" :) checked out.  Good luck.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Make an appointment with your vet.  Sounds like a urinary tract infection.|`|AA11244754	call the vet and tell them what you have noticed and see if they want you to go ahead and take him in to be examined, remember the old saying: better safe than sorry.

I would add in 1 table spoon per 5 gallon. In time you can increase it. these two things help with ick alot as ick doesnt do well at higher temps, and a thicker slime coat makes it hard for the ick to "breath", plus it helps with stress levels, and since ich is stress related, the less stress, the less ich.<br>  <br>  When medicating you need to pull the charcol filter out, charcol diactivates meds, so if it was in there when you up the meds in, the meds are not working. With it pulled out you shoud do a 5-10% water change every other day, basily to clean up the bottom of the tank. Every other water change, add in more salt, again amount varies on the size of the tank. So lets say you have a 30 gallon, and you added in 6 tables spoons of salt in. Every other water change I would add in about 1 table spoon of salt again. <br>  <br>  Also if this brand doesnt work, I would suggest either nox ich or the jungle brand, these work really well in the past for me. And once all is said and done, keep up on a 10% water change weekly, or 20 % bi weekly. Dont wait a full month or longer between changes.|`|t4zobY3Haa	I think you should wait till tomorrow.<br>  <br>  After all 3 days is 72 hours so thats the time you should put it on<br>  <br>  If you want to be EXTREMELY precise try putting it on tomorrow at the same time you put it on the day before :)|`|eH54r81Aaa	Wait till Saturday.<br>  and ADD SALT!<br>  buy it from a fish store, not normal salt!<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	id wait till tomorrow. give it a full three days.

JGq9rKBOaa	How many snakes do you have? <br>  <br>  While I usually recommend raising one's own mice as the most humane way to get snake food, if you only have one or two snakes, you have to be careful with the mice or you'll end up with far too many. Not a problem for you yet, clearly, but I'd recommend revising your breeding plan before trying again. Of course, you could always just breed a few litters now and freeze them for later when they get to the proper size.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd recommend the following.<br>  <br>  1. Get new females. Having litters back-to-back is mentally and physically stressful. If they haven't already proven themselves to be good mothers, breeding them again isn't going to increase the chances. <br>  <br>  2. Make sure they're in an ideal setup. What do you have in the tank they're in? Make sure they've got hiding places and nesting materials, like tissue paper. Use a thick layer of Carefresh or other paper-based bedding on the bottom. Even though they're feeders, they need to be kept in conditions that keep them comfortable and allow for natural behavior - it reduces stress.<br>  <br>  3. Feed them a good diet. What are they getting now? I'd recommend Harlan Teklad lab blocks, I forgot the formula number, but the kind meant for pregnant, nursing, and growing mice - it has more fat and protein than the maintenance foods.<br>  <br>  4. Disturb them as little as possible. Don't move them after they have litters. <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd recommend at least a 3 tank setup. One for males, one for females, and one for breeding. I'd start with 2 or 3 females in one cage, introduce a male and let him stay for about a week. After the week, put him in his own cage. The females can all raise their litters in the same cage. When the babies are about 3-4 weeks old, separate them by sex - you don't want an exponential growth scenario here. What you want to aim for is a small, controlled number of breedings - don't let the same female have multiple litters back-to-back, and don't let the females breed if they are too young.
ArBOK95aaa	when cats are about to give birth, their stomachs become very hard, making it hard to feel individual kittens. If she is having contractions, you might feel them.<br>  <br>  Cats usually stop eating 12 hours before labor.  They become very restless and act as though they can not get comfortable.<br>  <br>  I'm concerned because you said this cat hasn't been eating normally for several days.  This could be an indication that something is wrong.  I can not recommend highly enough that you get this cat into a vet to make sure that everything is ok, because so many things can go wrong.  She could have started labor when she went off her food, and has had a kitten stuck in her canal all this time.  IF that happened, then the kitten is dead, and could be decaying and causing toxic issues for the other kittens and the mother as well.  I'm not saying this happened, I am saying it is a possibility, and if this cat were in my care, I would spend the $20-30 for an office visit to make sure that things were going ok with her.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	from what i remember our cat started pacing a lot and panting when it was time for her to actually have her kittens. if she isnt acting like she normally would it is probably going to be soon. :0)|`|VMY7No0eaa	Sounds like it.<br>  they get nervous acting and if she is trying to get you to hang around then I would say yes.<br>  SHE wants you to reasure her<br>  when you come back make sure to check in on her right away.<br>  If you can at least bring her inside to have the babies that would be better for her.<br>  (keep toms from killing the kittens...or other animals)|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Yes it does sound like the birth is very near, some cats do become a bit clingy at this time especially first time mothers, its as if they are nervous and confused about whats going on,so keep checking on her, but i feel it would be safer for her indoors as foxes will smell the blood and come and eat them,you say you feed her kitten food this is not suitable, she needs food with vitamins intended for an adult cat,especially during pregnancy as she is eating for quite a few! this to is important too when she is feeding them, so she will need a more suitable food to help with her milk production.|`|cdef7d57cde545f4d5b263c965f9a1f9aa	It sounds like she is due very soon. I had a female cat that someone was giving away and she was less that 1 week from her due date. She woke me up at my past boyfriends place because she had gone into labor and was very wet and going to deliver in the next few minutes. So I went back to my place in the middle of the night and stayed up and helped deliver 6 healthy kittens, but mom was sick and ran away after 24 hours and I hand raised them.

ALL members of the family have to WANT a dog too (otherwise the animal suffers).<br>  <br>  Border Collies are very clever breeds but are more usually suited to experienced dog owners.  They demand so much exercise and time.<br>  <br>  Please read my BEFORE YOU BUY section of my website.|`|cmJFC5LOaa	Think shes right that is a very small accor, and border collies love to run, i know you want some one to agree with you but they need a bigger yard sorry|`|pd5rERcfaa	Border Collies are working dogs in every sense of the term.  If they don't have a lot (repeat: a lot) of physical AND mental exercise they will become very unhappy and very tough to live with.  Please do your homework, this kind of dog needs a very active lifestyle.  Don't forget to check your local shelters and breed rescue groups, adopting saves lives.
aYjF2SOKaa	Why are none of your rabbits fixed?<br>  If you're any kind of responsible pet owner, you'd have your females spayed as soon as they were old enough to try and eliminate the risk of cancer. You must not really care about your pets.<br>  Breeding should be left to the people who KNOW what they're doing, not irresponsible people who think they should let their rabbits breed because they're cute.<br>  Before the kits are born, make sure the does are alone, and in separate cages, so there is no competition. between 28-30 days into the pregnancy, your does will start nesting (hopefully, anyway) and they will start to pull large chunks of fur from their chests/bellies. Give them PLENTY of extra hay and bedding. Do some research into rabbit breeding. <br>  <a href="http://www.rabbitrehome.org.uk/care/breedingrabbits.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbitrehome.org.uk/care/bree...</a><br>  Read that, and find some sites for yourself.<br>  Seriously, reading your more recent adds to your post, I'm now even more sure that you shouldn't have any animals, let alone '7 cats'...If you had that many cats, why would you have rabbits running loose around your garden anyway? Jesus, do you have any idea of the dangers your bunnies are in if they're running about all day with no pen surrounding them? What about if some other cat were to come into your garden and maul them? Or, if you DO live in the middle of London, a disease ridden rat could bite your bunnies, 'cuz, you know, you're never more than 3 feet from a rat in London, nice, huh? <br>  Grow up a little.|`|P9byozx9aa	DON'T TOUCH THEM. Unfortunetly mother rabbits will eat their young if they think a preditor is near them, don't ask why they just do. Don't touch them till they are at least 5 weeks old. Make sure the females are seperated, the other female may kill the babies. That the basics, if you want to be a little more advanced, feed the mother, a little squash, or a little peanuts to help them produce more milk still feed them their regualar diet.|`|oREAHmqRaa	we didn't do anything,  my rabbit who roamed the garden would mate with the rabbit from up the road..... yes the rabbit from up the road would go out its garden and down road into my garden and mate every so often with my rabbit and they had Bunny's. oh my sister handled  bunnies one time and mum ate them|`|PTyinkf6aa	dont give them a johny|`|hclSguIPaa	i duno much? but we bread our rabbit - DO NOT let the male near the babies apparently i can eat them or attack them ! also it may be an idea to keep the females appart ?<br>   hope it helps ! :)|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	well if your indoor rabbit is Houdini then I DOUBT he got out on his own and had help from some one (you) in doing so. Some one wants kits and now they are asking how to care for them. I guess whenever you own males and females this is something you should know about. Why arent your females in cages? are the just running around in the back yard free? if they are cages, did the male get a bobby pin and pick the locks on the cages and get in??? you should go on Dave Letterman in that case. <br>  ANYWAY yes if they successfully bred your looking at 2 litters in 29 to 31 days. The females need to be separated, the male taken out. THE MALE WILL NOT EAT OR ATTACK THE BABIES. despite what the other person said. What will happen is that the females will feel competion with each other for food and space, they may begin to fight and in the process hurt each others babies. They may become nervous or feel over crowded and kill there OWN babies or neglect them. SO seperate the females and get the male neutered. Also if he is left in there he will re-breed them right after the kits are born and then they will be pregnant again while nursing and this is no good for the moms. Your male is likely bigger than the dwarfs. Hopefully the females can handle the kits during labor. IF they do NOW you will have the job of finding them all homes and since rabbits are not that popular you may have to keep some. Hope the litters are not big. I suggest you plan litters more carefully and have homes lined up before "Accidently" breeding them again<br>  <br>  PS: YOU CAN AND SHOULD TOUCH the babies. The problem is dont mess with them much. You need to check them daily. To take out any dead ones that can attract predators and cause rot and decay in the nests. You need to be sure to supply them a nesting box and LOTS of nesting materials. The moms with cover them with hair. With the first week after kindling you can move the hair aside, Count them and check for dead ones. Put any that have come out back in, and thats about it. After there hair begins to come in you need to handle them a little. Though not much and try to keep the mom from seeing then she wont get upset, but most mothers dont care that you TOUCH them, they care if you bring too much attention and too much messing around with there nest.<br>  <br>  Wow your defensive.. so I am right! I LIKE being a stuck up cow, I dont bow to silly questions and kiss but for points. Also if you wanted to save there lives you wouldnt let them run around on a patio and backyard free. You know how many things eat rabbits???? I really dont care what you think about me. You dont know me either and I know what you are. SO thats all that matters. Despite your anger and hatred at me, I gave you solid information that you asked for. SO thats what you should be reading, and just skip over everything else. I DO KNOW EVERYTHING.... what I havent put in there is that I have raised over 200 rabbits for shows and the meat industry. I know rabbits, and that was before I started my job as a Animal Shelter Manager for 9 1/2 years and still am very active in animal rescue. I also worked for 5 years as an animal abuse and neglect officer for the state of Minnesota and if you wish I can email a license number to you. In most cases if I was to hear you were letting your pet rabbits run around your property with out proper shelter then i would have cited you for neglect.<br>  <br>  OH I NEED TO ADD, that I KNOW what you did, HOW???? because any WILD MALE Rabbit can and will breed with free running domesticated rabbits, and since you are too dull to mention that in your question then you KNOW that the mini lop male is the father, giving me reason to think that you WATCHED it happen and planned it. <br>  WILD RABBITS ARE EVERYWHERE MY DEAR.... in london or a big city.... well you just proved since your arguing with me, that you did it on purpose. Only the guilty argue, plus your male just slipped on out to the patio from where? an open door? a hole in your wall? a invisible curtain between the walls... and he just happened to escape on to this WALLED PATIO.... ahh interesting... keep digging yourself in a hole hun its ok  OOOH and the question "what to do when breeding rabbits" hun its just another justification... you didnt put what happens when bunnies accidently breed? ahhh yeah<br>  <br>  YOUR a kid... point taken and argument done.

EJpiaCMQaa	It does sound like your parakeets are either closely bonded or ready to breed.  Preening and feeding each other are signs of bonding, so the two are already close.  Males will bob their heads and both parakeets pupils of their eyes will dilate if they are excited.  <br>  <br>  The best age to mate parakeets is around 1 year of age.  I don't know the ages of your parakeets, so I don't know for sure if the one is ready to breed.  Parakeets shouldn't breed at all if they are under 6 months of age.  <br>  <br>  As for sexing parakeets, adult males have bright blue ceres.  Adult females have tan, whitish-blue, or brown ceres.<br>  Baby males have pink translucent ceres, which may have a bluish or purplish tint.  Baby females have opaque white ceres, which may have a bluish tint.|`|JHguT3c9aa	They might.. Female budgies have a white to pinkish cere, and males have a bluish one.

zv8QaMe1aa	3-4 days isn't likely enough time for them to work out their turf issues..... can you keep them in separate rooms, or keep her cat at her place and look in on him there?   It likely would have helped if you'd kept the "interloper" (that's how your cat sees him) in his carrier for a while when you first brought him in so that they could sniff each other out for a while before he was loose.... kind of hard to do that retroactively though -- wouldn't be as effective.  In the meantime, reassure your cat that he's still your number 1 cat but don't let him bully the newbie... some pennies in a can to shake as a "no no" noise can be very effective with cats..... separate rooms would likely be better for such a short term though.|`|zpwJR60baa	Check the following from the San Francisco SPCA cat to cat introduction. <br>  <br>  Are both cat fix?

Cats, males especially, are territorial, two of my males, who practically grew up together still fight today|`|se27sAUwaa	There is no way they are going to get along in that little amount of time. You can either keep them in separate rooms, each supplied with litter boxes, food dishes, toys, etc. Or you need to give your girlfriend her cat back and explain to her that while you would LOVE to help her out, it's not worth torturing your own cat and possibly having both of them injured. They would need a few weeks, maybe even months to completely adjust to each other and eliminate fighting. My kittens have been together for 2 weeks now and they still go at it sometimes.  <br>  <br>  (Just out of curiosity - is your girlfriend just too busy to deal with the cat or is she away? I could understand if she was away and and asked you to watch her kitty. That's very nice of you. But if she's home when she's not doing whatever it is that she's doing then she needs to take her cat home. People do work and own pets at the same time, she should not be an exception.

That often helps alot.  No matter the thing to do is introduce them slowly, and let them smell each other through a door.  Put a shoelace with a cat toy attached to each end and leave one cat on one side of the door and the other on the other side, Maybe not seeing each other but playing and getting used to each others scent will help.  Often this takes a few days though.  There is also a pheremone type of liquid you can buy at pet stores, I'm sorry I forget the name but you put it on both cats and it's supposed to calm them, I've heard alot of people say it helps so maybe give it a shot.  And whatever you do feed them in different areas and keep your pets fav toys separate, and ask your friend to bring her cats bed an fav toys along it might help. Good luck|`|HinZuPZ6aa	keep them in separate rooms.<br>  <br>   the other cat is invading your cats territory and space and hes sticking up for himself

Ask a western performance trainer about a topline, and you'll get a conformation lesson on what to look for.  Ask a dressage expert about topline, and you'll get a training and function lesson, involving the development and use of muscles, tendons, and ligaments.<br>  I have ridden in both disciplines, and tend to define a topline by the way the muscles are conditioned and functioning, regardless of conformation.<br>  When the longissimus muscles of the spine are over-conditioned, a hollow back is the result.  These muscles have to relax in order for the spine to elevate and round.  So when correct work allows the back to elevate as the hips engage, the muscles that are being developed are the loin and abdominal muscles.  No, it is not possible to over develop them....and a good topline will include the relaxation of muscling well into the base of the neck.  The area of concern in the neck is the underside, which is often overdeveloped when people try to hurry the training of flexion at the poll, and the resistance to force causes building of the muscles at the underside rather than along the topline as the neck is naturally brought into correct position for the horse to be brought onto the bit.<br>  If you want to build a topline, it starts by developing impulsion from the rear while the horse stretches the neck forward and reaches for the bit.<br>  As the abdominals and loin muscles strengthen, they compete with the longissimus muscles that keep the spine hollow and stretched, and cause these back muscles to relax......then the spine is freed up and can elevate, and the pelvis can become engaged.  The neck can assume a natural position for work on the bit, in a rounded frame.<br>  Once that is happening, the topline is functionally correct.  Any horse with any conformation can be improved when correct work allows the development of this working topline.  So, back to your question, it depends on whether you are evaluating conformation, or evaluating function, as in a working topline.|`|AA11484393	I was not going to answer this question, because the other person had it spot on.

L22hVXTIaa	If they believe it's pancreatitis, why aren't they treating him for that?  Exploratory surgery is pretty extreme - especially when they aren't sure what they're looking for, and pancreatitis is treated with fluids and meds.<br>  <br>  I think, if I were you, I'd want a second opinion before I let them open up my dog.  Also, if he's very weak, has fluid built up in his abdomen, why aren't they getting him stable before proceeding.<br>  <br>  To me, some of this doesn't make sense - I'd get a second opinion, but do so ASAP!<br>  <br>  ADD:  Have had two dogs who suffered from pancreatitis and never had a mention of exploratory surgery from the vet.

Pancreatic tumors can produce the symptoms of pancreatitis and can also produce a non-bacterial accumulation of fluid.  Unfortunately, prognosis for pancreatic exocrine neoplasia is not good and the vet may suggest immediate euthanasia.  I really thought about skipping the question since I didn't have anything positive to say, but thought it might help to research the condition so you know what you are dealing with and can make decisions you feel comfortable IF this is the case.  It is 100% possible that I know absolutely nothing about what I am talking about.

If they don't think he'll survive the surgery they should tell you. they will let you decide to do surgery anyways or put him down. <br>  <br>  Whatever happens, I wish you all the luck in the world.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Your doctor is suggesting an aggressive form of treatment. Pancreatitis can be caused by an obstruction of the pancreatic duct, or inflammation of the first part of the pancreas. In this case that part is surgically removed. Another possibility is cancer, and the cancerous tissue would be removed. From blood work done I think your vet has an idea of what is going on, but has not told you everything he may have to do. This has caused you more worry. Surgery is always a risk, but so could conventional treatment. If all goes well, your dog could be as good as new after recovery.
e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	The smallest pythons are of the genus Antaresia, and come from Australia.

It's called the Children's Python and it gets up to 3 ft but averaging at 2-2.5ft, which is pretty manageable. However, this particular species is not an easy one to find at any pet store but few reptile and snake stores have them. The next smallest python, which would be the much easier one to find, is the Ball Python. This one is very very easy to find in a pet store because you dont even have to go to a reptile or snake specific store. You can go to a pet store like Petco or Petsmart, or any other general pet store and they'll most likely have it. This is the most common pet python to find in any pet store because it grows to 3-5ft long and are extremely tame. Because of this, it is also an inexpensive kind of python usually costing between 80-130 bucks each.|`|aM3dtyuDaa	childrens python

P9byozx9aa	Because there are domesticated rabbits and when people hear about eating cute little bunnies it just brings people down to think that someone would eat a cute little bunny|`|4gZYucHMaa	Because there are some sick freaks out there who will buy a rabbit from the pet store and cook it up.<br>  <br>  I agree, there are rabbits that are for meat (however sad I think that is) but taking house pets as meat is just low.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Because Rabbits are know commonly kept as 'House' pets,its like reading or hearing about someone selling Cat or even DOG meat! That's how i see my rabbits. In most peoples images Rabbits are cuddly,cute & Innocent creatures. I guess that they don't feel the same way about Kangaroos! <br>  <br>  That's my take on the subject.xxx|`|03fiqGJwaa	who cares. i wouldn't eat one. they're just too pretty and soft... all that cuddly stuff.<br>  <br>  other animals for the most part are not.|`|4SQx8smEaa	I do not eat any of those meats.|`|HDz8fAfIaa	>< I love animals, they have a mind to you know, let's say instead of humans, cows took over the earth. And they decided these humans look tasty so we'll eat them, how the heck do you think you'd feel? >> <br>  <br>  Plus, bunnies are to cute to eat.. *hugs my pet bunny, Rascal* ._. Shes so soft.|`|nJtU2EmIaa	Bunnies are cuter than some of the other animals we eat. Just like how an attractive person tends to land the job, get payed a higher salary and is simply better treated than an unattractive person, more folks feel sad about eating cute bunnies than big, ugly kangaroos. Sad, isn't it?|`|hTi4MuKoaa	well.. you can do anything you want but i think its that when they were kids it was always awww look at the cute bunny<br>  I would never eat a bunny cause I have pet bunnys so yeah
vjijiJT3aa	they might not be ready, keep all the breeding materials in the cage such as a nest and materials for them to make bedding in their nest also go to a pet store that has petamine and you can give them that with their food it encourages mating, you do all that and they will breed when their ready.|`|SlXguu9uaa	cuz one of them is ugly|`|bZDzSfuRaa	I've heard that they need a box in there cage, then they'll mate.  Sounds weird but that's what one of the employees at a pet store told me once.  Worth a shot!  Good Luck!
Ow6lKFXiaa	Of course they do.  That's why they are such good jumpers.  They can tell exactly how high, low, far, or deep something is and the calculate the jump perfectly (well, most of the time anyway).<br>  <br>  Kia:  LOL, just as I read your answer my 1- year-old kitten went "wacky cat" and went SMACK into the wall!  LOL|`|DtkLsetkaa	Of course they do.  Otherwise they would be running head first into walls every single time.<br>  <br>  Haha!!  Yeah mine do that every now and then too.  Hence why i said "every single time" because it sure as heck does happen on occasion :)|`|ArBOK95aaa	yes, and can see for 120 miles.  they see in some color, but not all the colors we see in.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	They must have , we used to have a male cat who provided us with countless hours of entertainment . we used to throw pillows at him and he would see them coming and duck out of the way.He was 17 when i had him gently put to sleep last year . We miss him so much.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Never met one that did not... even when 1/2 blind.|`|gHK8Cybiaa	obviously they have or they wouldn't be able to judge how far to jump at something|`|3b6i9eiyaa	Depth Perception<br>  <br>  Depth perception is enhanced when the visual fields of the 2 eyes overlap.  Merely viewing an object with both eyes simultaneously, however, does not guarantee improved depth perception.  Stereopsis (binocular depth perception) results when the 2 eyes view the world from slightly different vantage points and the resulting image is fused into a single image.  If the 2 images are not fused, double vision may result.  Most dogs probably have 30-60° of binocular overlap (versus approximately 140° cats and humans).  Animals and humans with only one eye, however, still have the ability to perceive depth.  Monocular clues relating to depth include relative brightness, contour, areas of light and shadows, object overlay, linear and aerial perspective, density of optical texture, and motion parallax.<br>  <br>  Visual Perspective<br>  <br>  Obviously, height of the eyes above the ground has a major impact on the perception an animal has of its environment, and this height varies in dogs from less than 8 inches at the shoulder to more than 34 inches.  This means a field of tall grass may appear as impenetrable brush to a Shih Tzu but an Irish Wolfhound visually orients itself in the same field with no difficulty.  Some breeds, such as the English Springer Spaniel, may have developed behavioral traits, such as leaping into the air while searching for objects, which may serve to enhance their visual perspective.  Cats have the same difficulty as small dogs so will attempt get above the ground to increase their visual perspective. <br>  <br>  Visual Field of View<br>  <br>  The extent of the visual field in dogs (i.e. the area that can be seen by an eye when it is fixed on one point) also varies by breed.  In brachycephalic breeds where the nose is shorter and the eyes are more laterally placed, the extent of the visual field and amount of binocular overlap are undoubtedly different from that of mesocephalic breeds who have longer noses and more forward looking eyes.  The visual field of view of the average dog, however, is estimated to be 240 degrees (versus 200 ° in cats and 180° in humans), suggesting that, with each eye, the typical dog can see from 120° ipsilateral to between 15 and 30° contralateral, for a total monocular field of view of 135 to 150°.  This wide field of view increases the ability of dogs to scan the horizon.
vY1dS3hUaa	You should go to your town hall and have the vet's quarters examined.  If they turn a pet away, well gosh darn it everyone should know about it!  I would suggest calling another vet and having them do the check up.  Maybe a vet that won't turn you away.<br>  Good luck!|`|4TX26viFaa	Each state has a veterinary board, just google your state and the words 'veterinary board', you'll find a page to send a complaint to.<br>  <br>  Ferrets aren't rodents, they're mustilids which are carnivores. A vet may NOT have training in exotics, which the ferret would be classified as. Most vets start their training with livestock and domestic animals (cats dogs and rabbits, little else).  But for her to argue like that is extremely unprofessional. Yes, on that case you should report her. <br>  <br>  She at the very least should just have kept calm and referred you to a different vet locally.  Maybe you got her on a bad day?  Still, I would not go back there with any other animal.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Arggh!<br>  <br>  I hate people like that! Who think they are always 'right'. Seems like you dealt with it very well AND gave correct info! For gods sake,SHE should be the one with 'the knowledge'!! Personally i would contact the Vets manager,or someone there with 'great' importance & report her,that's disgusting the way she spoke to you! Ferrets are well known P E T S!<br>  I agree with you!<br>  <br>  Best of luck.xxx|`|jyGTlpzTaa	If she thinks ferrets are rodents I would agree her degree needs checking...why dont you contact the BVA:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bva.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bva.co.uk/</a> if you are in the UK, or find your vet society in your country.<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd let it be...she's clearly an ignoramus, she'll get whats coming to her for being so rude.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	The best thing to do would be to call your local news Station tell them about it, they will put it on the new and if more people come forward saying they have had some of the same problem, they will investigated.|`|X3bu0B8faa	You can contact the American Veterinary Medical Association. They can guide you to who you need to speak to on the National level. Locally, contact the State Licensing board, see if this person has had other complaints against her, also report her to the Better Business Bureau. Make sure you write letters because phone calls can sometimes be ignored. Write a note to your local paper, explaining about your pets,and tell about this Vet. Don't get nasty, just state facts and tell folks that you are really sad that Vets don't treat all animals, just a chosen few- My Vet treats anything- even snakes. If he doesn't know about them, he finds out or refers you on. He tries!|`|XI2iylR4aa	Hi, I don't know if reporting the vet is going to work.  Some vets don't treat certain animals, and that is their right.<br>  <br>  However, she was very rude on the phone, and that is not right.  A vet should understand how important a person's pets are.  That is just common sense.<br>  <br>  Here's what I think...it is a blessing that the vet was such a jerk on the phone, because now you're going to bring your ferrets to a more competent, understanding vet, and the bad vet won't get any of your business.<br>  <br>  If you really feel the need to retaliate, maybe you could post on yelp about your experience, or on yellowpages.com.  Also you could try ferret websites, just to get the word out.<br>  <br>  But, even though I think the vet was a jerk and totally out of line, I don't think there's anything you can really report her for.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'm glad you found a better vet!<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, there is a way to check a vet's license info:<br>  <a href="http://www.jugglingcats.com/veterinary/vet_license.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jugglingcats.com/veterinary/v...</a>|`|1RSQj9rRaa	Wait for a while and then you can phone in again with your ferrets, if you get the same response you could maybe talk to the manage of the vet clinic.
OdDbR4Psaa	A white patch on his body could just be a sign of his colour changing. Make sure he has no fuzzy like growth, white spots that look like grains of salt, open wounds, bloating or any other signs of diseases. Also make sure his temperature is right, and check the pH, ammonia and nitrite levels. If everything else seems fine and he's still eating and moving, he should be fine. <br>  <br>  Here are the common signs of fin rot to look for<br>  <br>  * Fin edges turn white<br>  * Fins fray<br>  * Bases of fins enflamed<br>  * Entire fin may rot away<br>  <br>  If he does have fin rot,  the first and most important step to make sure the water is always clean and warm. Always remove uneaten food and extra waste. Also make sure there are no hard plastic plants or gravel that could tear his fins. <br>  <br>  Add some aquarium salt just in case. 1/2 teaspoon per gallon of water, it's a good preventative for many diseases anyway and will not harm your betta. So if he doesn't have it, a little aquarium salt won't hurt.|`|8ed6a85ddcc1f1964de9e22f4c977be3aa	there is a good betta website that also has realy good infromation on this kind of stuff called www.bettatalk.com the lady who wrote the info is very experienced|`|qYPCkscTaa	It's not fin rot, you would've noticed his tail edges getting darker & shorter way before it started attacking his body. It sounds like a fungus to me, Aquarium Salt will help, but not get rid of it, you need a medicine just for fungus. <br>  First, you need to identify if it's true fungus or body fungus. Here are the symptoms of both:<br>  <br>  True Fungus:<br>  Whitish tufts of cotton-like material found on the fin, tail and body.<br>  <br>  Body Fungus: <br>  Grey-ish white stringy material covering most of the body, white or gray patches.<br>  <br>  To treat True Fungus, use MarOxy, and then either Maracyn-Two or Maracyn to prevent any secondary infections.<br>  <br>  To treat Body Fungus, use Maracyn.<br>  <br>  Hope your fish gets better :)<br>  All products can be found at PetSmart or Petco, or another local petstore.
831e6e241697fdb4e0bff3e5c9c2c142aa	I would definitely quit going to him!! He should appreciate you coming back and all the past business. You shouldn't have to deal with a vet that is going to be a jerk. Your #1 concern is your kitten/cat not the vet, so just take them somewhere else where the 3 of you feel comfortable and are treated like you should be!!It is not worth it to be made to feel bad about something like this! I had this same problem with a hair salon, totally ridiculous!! Good luck!!!:)|`|2075f8e6b7bfcd44fc4bfe85505d1df7aa	Yup, I agree with everyone here. Stop seeing thi vet if he's going to be so petty.<br>  <br>  I did the same thing as you but it was for vacinnations. My vet took it ok, but he did explain to me why his charges are higher and the freebies he is giving out to offset his charges. But he was cool about me getting the other vet to do the vacinnations.|`|a0d49e57c3c1527675256264698dad37aa	Yes if he's going to act that way I would, no telling what he would do to your cat if you had to leave her.  Sounds like he has issues.|`|c3e5f1f070a824a8ca32dc108370958daa	I would just go to the other vet.  He's being petty and that's usually reserved for hairdressers...lol!

As much as you spent already, you don't have to go to just because his feelings got hurt.  I would go to another place because as long as you spent $$$$ there, he was smiling in your face.  You leave, it it shows where his head is.  It's sure not about your kitty. (pardon the pun)|`|AA12191722	If he's going to act like that, than yes, since you already have another vet anyway, you may just want to quit going to him.  He should be a professional and get over it.|`|AA11656632	He's acting childish &  not professional at all. I ditch him & stick with the new vet.|`|AA11125915	tell him "Listen, doc, it's been real, but now me & my cats have to get the f*ck on. Later"

(they sell them at Wal-Mart: store may vary)|`|decc7960724803240bcffe832e835f5baa	did you take him to the vet specifically for his teeth?  look at your pets back molars, pull his lips back gently, chances are those far back molars are covered in a greenish/brown tartar, get your pets teeth cleaned annually by the vet, they will also pull any teeth that are absessed or infected. brushing the teeth twice a month isnt going to do much, my vet told me in order to make a difference you need to do it once a day  like humans.  make sure you are feeding him a good food, that doesnt have corn in the first couple ingredients, nutro, solid gold, organix are good.|`|6b7352123726385d404e7ac5813a4cd0aa	Depends on what it smells like. Dogs naturally have bad smelling breath from the food they eat but if it's not smelling like food, then likely it is something in the teeth or gums. He could have gotten an infection since being at the vet. Check the gums and make sure nothing is inflammed or swollen. If you're sure it's not the teeth, get him some of the freshen up bones and treats.|`|a0e3f4f78237ccff362798a941b4ab03aa	try those bones with freshning stuff|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	He could be having problems with some internal problems.

1909d02279c114b441a9e48dfa30204daa	Practical experience is often more important than schooling, unless you want to work for a corporation or the military.  If you are young, get a job with a clinic.  You will probably have to start by cleaning kennels.  If you prove your worth, you will be able to work your way up to helping the vets.  This is how I started, and I have been a vet for over 15 years now...  I don't put much stock in someone with a tech degree from our local CC but no experience (owning a pet doesn't count) who walks in demanding a ridiculous salary.  I'd rather hire someone green and train them myself.  Later, If they still want to go, I pay for some of their classes so they can learn more about why we do what we do.  When you do go to school, ask if vets are teaching the classes, and how much hands on time you will get.  Good luck!!!|`|91f76c6fa43be75b11cb1be783108196aa	Why is it that people want to save animals? I see announcements on the TV that says you can save a dog a cat for 1 dollar a day, but you can use that same dollar to sponsor a child in a third world country why do we still give money to save old Yeller.   wouldn't you prefer a million dogs to die that to save the life of one child or are we so racist that we rather give to the animals rather than other countries because their not Americans.

I did crate training and shes only gone in the house about....5 times, not bad. Basically, when your gone, sleeping, not playing with him or to busy to watch him to let him outside, he is in a cage. It doesnt take long before you can let him out of the cage more..Like I said though, look it up on-line for specifics, its getting very popular.

Get a crate a little larger than the pup keep it in there when you are sleeping, when you are not home or are not available to watch it. Take it out immediately when you take it out of the crate or after playing or eating. Praise for going outside. If you catch it having an accident in the house tell it "no potty outside" as you take it outside. If it has an accident and you do not witness it then unfortunately you cannot do anything. Do not yell at the dog reprimand in a firm voice. Do not hit the dog. Don't rub it's nose in it's mess.|`|41fbace3a35d7b3b723b169b135d2511aa	I would try crate training.

0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there again Hanna.......here's the guidelines for kitten and cat vaccinations that I answered in your previous question:<br>  6-9  weeks - 1st Feline Distemper FVRCP<br>  12 weeks - 2nd FVRCP<br>  12 weeks - *1st Feline Leukemia (see following * note)<br>  15 weeks - 3rd FVRCP<br>  15 weeks - Rabies (required by most states, but some if the cat is also an outdoor cat)<br>  16 weeks - *2nd & Final Feline Leukemia<br>  <br>  Prices will vary so you would need to call to learn the amount. The average is about $45-55 for the first round of vaccinations and a little less for the second a few weeks later as they are required in order to be effective. If you are referencing to Banfield vet at PetSmart they can do the vaccinations and give you a price list too.|`|AA11299986	talk to your friends family and neighbors to see where they take their animals, do some investigating yourself, call vets offices ask them how much they charge for an office visit, follow up visits, shots, spay/neuter, etc.  arrange to visit the vets office and have a look at it and make sure it is clean etc.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	You cat is old enough for her vaccination right now.  Any local veterinarian can give her the shots she needs (and some states demand that a vet give the rabies vaccination).  If you take her to a vet, and she's allergic to the shot, the vet can giver her an "eppi" shot to counteract her allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  Unless the PetSmart folks have staff knowledgable enough to know what to do if the cat reacts badly to a vaccination, I wouldn't take the cat there.<br>  <br>  There are some vaccinations you can administer yourself for between $3.95 and $7.95.  The major problem with admintering these yourself is if the cat is allergic to something in the vaccination... Some vaccinations can be purchased through the internet at places like www.drsfostersmith.com, but because most vaccinations have to be refrigerated and shipped quickly, you end up paying about $25.00 in shipping costs...<br>  <br>  It all comes down to: who do you trust to give your cat the best vaccination care?  A vet, Petsmart staff, our yourself...?|`|491e6d55d8ef4331ab2f9c8110ee7cb2aa	you really should give her the shots<br>  it might be $30<br>  yeah if you dont have a vet near by|`|bc48360c6ed9e0d30580107c36ab706caa	She should get her first shots now, I adopted my kitten at 8 weeks and they already had her shots done. She need another vaccination after i bought her home and it cost about $25.00. I am not sure about petsmart as a place to get her shots, I go to the place (Bide-a-wee) where i adopted her from.
AA11580097	Having more than one rat does not mean that they don't bond to you. All mine love coming out and will climb onto me no problem and have bonded fine. I think they are much happier in a group(or pair), they have each other to snuggle up to and play with. I could never keep one on its own for its whole life as its impossible to be with them 24/7 and they love cuddling up and grooming each other. New rats can be introduced at any time, they don't have to be from the same litter. In one cage, I have four rats and none of them are brothers, they all get on fine. I also have a group of three unrelated boys that get on fine. <br>  If you're going to get another rat, I would suggest letting them meet on neutral territory like in the bath, so you can control any fighting. Do that a few times before putting the two girls together. They may fight as they sort out who's boss, but as long as no blood is shed, don't worry about it.|`|AA12377144	YES, they can get lonely, and you can't always play with them. Rats are not territorial and will accept another rat just fine. I have done that. I got Holiday a week or so after Winslydale, and all of my past rats got friends sooner or later.|`|095c168559e5f71090adacb612291cacaa	I have a rat, she lives alone. I take her out every day for a while, and she seems fine. I have heard that your rat will bond to another rat, and not to you if you have two or more. If you have the one, it will bond to you. If my rat is on someone else's shoulder and I put my hand up, she immediately climbs up my arm to my shoulder.|`|85111cc14878eecedf2892b4b1b9b839aa	Yes. Unless of course, you are always at home. Pets usually like company, either from their owner, or another animal of the same species.|`|AA11948848	Yes, Rats are naturally with other rats, it also depends when you got your rat if it had another rat in the cage with it, if it did not then no, if it did then YES.
41fbace3a35d7b3b723b169b135d2511aa	You cannot toilet train a dog. Do you mean housebreak a dog? Take it out every hour to use the bathroom. If it doesn't go bring it back in and either keep leashed to your or put in crate. In 15 minutes try again and repeat every 15 minutes until they go. When it goes tell them "Good girl/boy goes potty" and give them a treat.|`|de6a2b12133673eab0ae9b5de3806afbaa	well, I've seen it a movie, so it has to be true ;)

An xray won't show anything, but there are some blood tests that can possibly idenitfy the cause of them. A vet might also be able to do an EEG, if he or she has the equipment, to make the diagnosis. A brain CT could find the cause, but that would be next to impossible to perform on a dog, and cost quite a bit. Start with the blood tests. I don't know how much they run off the top of my head, but it should be the first and cheapest of all the possible tests. As far as fees for visiting the vet, you will probably be charged for a welness exam, which at my vet, runs about $40 I think.|`|AA11811680	i don't know that but ur dog is really sick|`|AA11987860	I come from CT, but I do know that dogs can have seizures from eating chocolate.

That doesn't mean that the dog wouldn't make a good pet, but I wouldn't recommend spending a bunch of money on a mix-breed dog when there are thousands that need rescued. Also, because of the way they are bred, these dogs end up with genetic disorders...that can be fatal.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Since cats are generally fastidious about their "toilet habits" when cats start "missing" the box, something is amiss.Depending on how far along she is in her pregnancy, if I understand you correctly, her increased body girth may be making her uncomfortable and she is not happy with the size or height of the box. As the babies develop, she will be getting heavier and more "bulky" so it may be hard for her to get into the box. Try a lower sided larger box.<br>  <br>  If this is not due to a later stage pregnancy,  and it is recent behavior, if it were my cat, I would be visiting the vet. Cats may have litter box aversion due to pain upon defecation and they associate the box itself with discomfort. <br>  <br>  A covered box in the future is a great idea. I have three of them for two cats. The boxes are large and high. My cats love them, and I enjoy not having to clean litter from the floor, and no more urine on the walls. But I do not recommend a covered box for a pregnant cat who may have problems getting in and out of the box.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs.|`|VMY7No0eaa	she may just not like the type / texture of the sand you are using. <br>  Is the litter box spotlessly clean?<br>  cats are funny that way.|`|4TX26viFaa	Usually it means their butt was over the side as they stood in the box.

0SuJ9wkXaa	I am a Jack Russell Terrier mommy and I love him to death. He keeps me exercised, entertained, and happy every day! But you need to make sure that you don't have a job that requires you to be out for a long day. You need to spend LOTS AND LOTS of time to train and love them.

I love him like he was my own child....|`|aCqSF87Raa	If the dog is not allowed indoors at ALL then do not get one. <br>  <br>  You cannot expect a dog to live outdoors 100% of the time - poor weather, extreme heat/cold, hail, thunderstorms, etc are some instances where the dog needs to be INDOORS (generally by law, as many dogs die this way.)<br>  <br>  And having an "outdoor" dog does not excuse proper training, socialization, OR exercise (meaning running around the backyard is NOT enough, all dogs need walks.) I would think it would be harder to train and socialize a dog who is never in the house....<br>  <br>  The dogs you seem to like absolutely NEED more than backyard runs, and they all tend to be LOUD when they're bored or have excess energy. They ALL need a job to do and prefer to be indoors with their "pack" anyway.<br>  <br>  Dogs are not lawn ornaments. Yes they may like to run around and many may enjoy the outdoors, but not all of their time/lives should be spent out there. PERIOD. Wait until you have a place where the dog can be allowed inside.<br>  <br>  PS - i don't totally dislike "outdoor dog" ideas but there are times when a dog should not be left outside.

I would not suggest keeping a hound in a back yard because they will live to escape and follow other scents. Also, herding and work dogs need a great deal of mental stimulation so you need to consider how much time you will spend with them and what activities you will want to do with them. Life only in a back yard can be very boring for a dog. Generally a dog that is left only in a back yard will make their own entertainment, such as digging holes, barking for hours and pacing. What kind of activities have you considered doing with your dog?|`|Yqy9fXcyaa	i think if you want a outside dog and you like beagles,basset hounds, and collies. i would chose a collie because there are active and really i think there outdoor dogs.|`|P6LJBVdtaa	you should get a yorkie they are soooo cute i love them:) and if its a girl you should name it sofie or bella:)))

However they both work well and I think the Dumb Cat is the best. <br>  <br>  They are about $10 for the spray bottle and about $30 for a huge refill.

(hat was not made to be a rude statement.)<br>  <br>  When you catch your cat doing something good you praise her. A cat's (or any animals) shouldn't be all bad or more bad than good. You have to make it fun!<br>  <br>  Clicker training is a very good way to make your cats mind work, to make it want to do good things, for good things. You want it to say, "Hey! Look at me! I'm doing something cute!". They will want to get your attention, to show you what good things they have done that day, "Hi! Hey look, I'm not scratching the couch! I'm scratching the post!" Click! Treat. "Good kitty!".<br>  That's how life should go, when you praise your cat more often than scolding it.<br>  <br>  Now I'm not saying you are disciplining your cat, and it doesn't have any fun. I'm just making a point.<br>  <br>  A cat does need discipline if it does something bad. In that case you can get out a spray bottle and squirt them when they jump on the counters, or scratch the couch.<br>  <br>  For scratching the couch, you can get double-sided tape. This annoys cats paws. You can also get Soft Paws/Claws (UK, Claws, US, Paws). Soft Paws work great! Most cats don't even notice them after a few minutes and it saves your cats claws (and bones), and your furniture and carpets!<br>  <br>  Counter, put something light on your counters that will fall off if the cat jumps up. You can also use foil so when your kitty jumps on the counter the foil makes a crinkly sound. Most cats don't like this (also works for couches.)<br>  You can also use a spray bottle so when she jumps p there, spray, no, and put her on the floor. A can of coins will work too.<br>  <br>  Clicker training is really fun for cats. It is like a game, and usually can  be used to distract your cat from a behavior, solve a behavior (such as being bored so they scratch everything), and many more!<br>  <br>  There is a book about Clicker Training:<br>  <br>  Getting Started Clicker Training for Cats by Karen Pryor-<br>  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/node/20" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/node/20</a><br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Getting-Starte..." rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Getting-Starte...</a><br>  An amazing book!<br>  <br>  The reward has to be something the cat likes, and will want again. You can make the reward different, it doesn't have to be the same thing. Always click while the cat is doing the motion.<br>  <br>  Before you do anything, you have to teach each cat what the clicker means. Do this one cat at a time.<br>  <br>  Take your clicker, and go into a quiet area with one of the kittens. Click! Treat (throw it on the ground in front of the kittens nose). Always click before treat. Do this until your kitten doesn't want to do it anymore, or you have done it about 10 times (which would be lucky). You want this to be fun.<br>  Next cat and repeat.<br>  <br>  Another useful (very useful) thing to teach your cat is to follow and touch a target.<br>  Put a spoon or your finger out in front of the kitten nose (about 10 inch. away). Rub tuna, or something very strong and good smelling (to the cat) on the object. The kitten will instinctively move forward and touch (smell) the object. Click and treat.<br>  Get to where you can move around the object so your cats follow it.<br>  <br>  Rollover<br>  Rollover. Take your clicker (use your tongue, pen, clicker, or bottle cap with a dimple in it) and when you see your cat rolling around on the floor (such as scratching his back, or inviting you for a tummy rub) Click! Treat, or rub his tummy. <br>  Do this a few time then next session use the word "rollover".<br>  <br>  Sit<br>  Hold your hand in front of your kittens nose with a really yummy treat in it. Turn up your hand so the kitten has to sit and look at it. Click as he is sitting. Then treat.<br>  Do this few times, then the next session you have use the word "sit".<br>  <br>  Up<br>  When a cat jumps on an object take the opportunity to teach him up. When he is jumping up, say up click and treat.<br>  You can also use the target (more sensible). Put the target above the object you want your kitten to jump on. Click while he is jumping up.<br>  Do this a few times, then next session use the word "up".<br>  <br>  Now you have the idea, right? I hope so!<br>  I hope I helped! Have fun with your cat!|`|0zriLTZXaa	Some cats will care if you squirt them with a water gun at first but they will keep doing it. When your cat does it again say no in a soft voice.

You never discipline a cat. If a cat displays bad behaviour just pick it up, look it straight in the eye and toss it away like you don't want it. They get the message.

It would help us to know how old your cat in order to help you better. <br>   A large percentage of are those concerning cat behavior. Many so-called "behavioral problems" result from the cat owners simply not understanding what cats are trying to tell us. And often cats' behavioral "quirks" are their most endearing traits.<br>  <br>  So the best wait to understand cat behavior is not by discipline water squirting, but just like dogs, cats can be rewarded.  They way to reward a cat is brushing, play time several time a day with a cat string. <br>  When they do a good behavior, you give them a treats.  Treats is the most effective tools.  Just like the dog,  you also tell them "good kitty".  When a cat jump up the counter, you tell them with a firmly word "down", and help them down the table. Once down you give them a treat.  When they bite on your plants, you can get bitter apple for your plants.  For scratching furniture, have a portable scratching post next to the couch.  If you catch them scratching your couch again, put them on the scratching post right away.  Also get double stick tape for the couch. Also having nail trim helps!

They cannot be disciplined with harsh physical methods. Cats are actually built rather delicately and are also creatures with a sense of dignity.|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  As Amanda pointed out, we don't have enough information to really answer your question completely but  we do want to help so I will do my best without all the facts.<br>  <br>  Actually what you said in your question was right on the money. "Please help and don't be rude." Cats do not appreciate our being rude to them, either, even if we are angry or upset with their behavior.  We need to deal with them politely.<br>  <br>  While cats can be sometimes be "annoying" with some of their behaviors, all cats behave the way that they do because they are communicating something to us. It is our job to learn their language and understand them. Just as we want them to learn what "no" and "down" means (good luck on the "down") we need to learn their language. Since they really can't verbalize their feelings, they speak "cat".<br>  <br>  So for your reading pleasure and to give you a lot of insight into why cats do what they do.. here is a great website for you. You may even want to print it for future and easy to access information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/whydo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/whydo....</a><br>  <br>  I especially love her answer to the question, "Why do cats suddenly take off at 90 miles an hour?" But almost every common feline behavior is addressed, with great humor and excellent facts.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Your cat is really not being a pain in the rear because she is being bad.. she is telling you something.<br>  <br>  Disciplining a cat must be done with great patience and done gently. Cats are very sensitive to sound and tone of voice. Cats can easily become scared of their people and this is something that needs to be avoided. Never hit a kitty for any reason, either. Again, that only gets them frightened and resentful, and upset.<br>  <br>  I will use a water pistol from time to time if I catch one of our cats misbehaving, and try hard not to let him associate the water gun with me. Using a can filled with pennies, makes a huge noise and can distract a misbehaving feline. Again, make sure that the cat does not associate you with the sound.. you want your cat to associate the behavior with the noise. Clapping your hands loudly can work to stop a behavior instantly .. to change the cat's mindset.<br>  <br>  Here are some good sites that can help you to train your kitty.<br>  <a href="http://prefurr.com/?p=128" rel="nofollow">http://prefurr.com/?p=128</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clydesight.com/livecat/catdisc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.clydesight.com/livecat/catdis...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I think you will find them helpful and that you and your cat will come to a better and deeper understanding. And don't forget when your kitty corrects an unwanted behavior to praise your cat strongly.

Many of the rescues are in Canada, but there is one in Woodbine, MD (Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue).  Good Luck!!|`|baca3e20aec5983eb3834efae2ec8406aa	I have a PMU that is a Register Quarter Horse.  I got her from northern New York.  If you google Horse rescue you should be able to find one.

ce562ebbddf191d82c3fc058b2a4d0bcaa	Livebearer fry are the only ones that can swim immediately after being born.  Egglayer fry are hatched and have an egg sac attached for a time.  Some of them absorb it quicker than others.  Until they start freeswimming, they are called wrigglers for good reason, all they can do is wriggle.<br>  <br>  Many absorb the egg sac within a few days, but others take up to a week to slim down and look like real fish.  Once they have absorbed the nutrients in the egg sac, you must feed them frequently or they will starve to death.  I feed all my fry at least 3 times a day.  Water changes are very important at this time too.  You should do 30-40% changes every 4-5 days until the fry are a couple months old.  This gives them the best chance to stay healthy and grow quickly.  Fish are stunted by lack of protein and poor water quality.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	It depends on the species, in general it's the time it takes to digest their yolk sac, but they are all born able to swim to some degree, some just happen to better than others :o)<br>  <br>  Reckon on a couple of days to be safe.|`|qYPCkscTaa	It really depends on the type of fry; some swim immediately and others in a few days.|`|UtaNIzQUaa	I thought all fry swam as soon as they were born. swim or be eaten.
gdH0Xmfjaa	There are many techniques for getting a horse to stop, my favorites are the pulley rein, and the always fun running them into the wall - i wouldn't recommend running into the outdoor arena fence just because if the horse decides to jump it...bad things happen. <br>  <br>  Why don't you ride her somewhere where she can't see the pasture? I so wouldn't put up w/ that. Maybe a stronger bit is in need until she gets the picture that she can't run away whenever she feels like it.<br>  <br>  She might be herd bound as well...other horses shouldn't be out in the pasture while your riding - big no no for me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I wouldn't reccomend trying to RIDE her in the feild, unless you plan on hauling some a$$.|`|y2nQ0o6Raa	I would recommend putting her in a different pasture for a while if she's turned out with other horses. As for her running, don't wait for her to build up speed before circling. As soon as you feel her start to tense, start bending her left and right and maybe do some figure eights. Don't be afraid to put your leg on and really make her come up into the bridle. Most people will completely take their leg off and pull when a horse starts to run, but that will just cause the horse to hollow its back and brace against the rider. Sit up straight, put your spur on, and hold the rein steady to push her into the bit as you turn to circle. She might do some leaping and bucking if you pull too much, but if you take your leg off you're just rewarding her for that behavior. Once you have her on a circle, use half-halts to make her round, don't just hang on the rein. Do the same if she throws her head up, but don't drop your hands down because she'll just brace more.<br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|TYyZwOtlaa	It sounds like she knows her pasture is an area where she doesn't have to work, i think she probably think if she goes back to her pasture, she wont have to do any work. Maybe you could try and beat her at her own game, and ride her in the field, or if she misbehaves too much, maybe just lunge her in there.
rVv5TC4Uaa	Im sure they are competing to see who is dominant or your chi is just mean.  Dogs have a way of working these things out.<br>  I would let them go at it unless you think the toy is really in trouble.<br>  then of course you would have to intervene.|`|547Ln6rNaa	My Labradors do this all the time (bitey face), you step in when it gets rough or if it has gone on to long. Otherwise, let them play while it is still play.<br>  <br>  My girls also have dominance wars and it depends on how they feel as to who jumps on who, they both hump each other at different times, but the bigger one tends to hump the little one when she has a toy the other wants. We don't allow prolonged humping, but we let some go on as they are sorting out their order.  <br>  <br>  Since you are saying he and she, watch out for when this becomes more then humping and becomes sexual interest if the animals are not neutered. About 7 months was when my girls had their first season.|`|lFdWmDjGaa	Well, if its cries of pains, try to make them stop, but if its just playful yelps thats ok. Its agood thing that your dogs are playing when theryre puppies though because that gets them used to other dogs so theryre not aggresive. If you think the one puppy is getting hurt, try buying them toys like tug of war ropes, it could become theyre new favorite game! :)|`|Zjq6vcAvaa	they r trying to esert dominance.if u have the patience to train them then i sugest u start earlier and stop them with verbal commands that u r using with them,but if u let them fight there is a liklyhood of injury soon,better seprate them now.best of luck.cheerz

4a9c5505ee9d9ef46125185dbfd85573aa	first, how old is the puppy? sounds like your leaving her in the kennel too long. One hour for each month is the rule but of course this rule varies.  some dogs have more control than others.  at 5 weeks I was coming home every 4 hours to let my pup out.  she must be a small pup, try a smaller kennel, one that gives her room to turn and lie down.  A kennel, in my opinion should be somewhere to sleep, not to play.  As my dog got bigger I gave him larger cages then when he finally grew up I bought an extra large kennel that he knows to go into when I get ready to leave, or when I start to cook and when we sit down for dinner.  Good Luck|`|8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	That's part of being a puppy "parent". Messes to clean up, time spent doing things you dont necessarily want to do, like cleaning up "accidents", dirt, chewed on shoes and more. You cant punish your puppy for being bored while you are away and not able to take care of her. If she is constantly making a mess or getting out of her kennel you may want to think of other alternatives for her while you need to be away. I know it is not realistic to be home 24/7 just seek out other options because this doesn't seem  to be working for you or the puppy.|`|AA11847146	Get rid of that dog and buy a lab...you wont go wrong there|`|2c5dc5b99d8b55f4638a68b5fe1de9daaa	The big keys here are how old is this pup, and what kind of "cage" are you using to keep her in, and how long you're leaving her. <br>  <br>  If your pup is under 10 weeks, then you should be taking it outside at least every three hours. Making them wait too long where they have to make a mess and go defeats the purpose of crate training and they won't learn anything. The crate should not be so big that she thinks she can play in it - the point is to confine her when you cannot watch her. It's not for punishment. If you can't be with her to let her out, can you get someone else to come in and do it for you? <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, without more information, we're pretty limited in what we can do to help you out.|`|41fbace3a35d7b3b723b169b135d2511aa	Use a bungie cord or a wire hanger to secure the kennel door.|`|b88a21edc3771579644822181096419eaa	what kind of create does she have that she can break out of?  my dogs have steel crates with bolting doors, there's no way they could get out.<br>  <br>  try leaving her in the crate when you're home so she can get used to it and be comforted by you at the same time.
6b7352123726385d404e7ac5813a4cd0aa	Crate training works wonders! Dogs won't go to the bathroom where they sleep so getting s small crate, only big enough for her to stand up, turn around, and lay down inside is best. Keep her crated and as soon as you let her out, take her outside immediately! Allow her to come back in ONLY after she has done her business then make sure you praise her like crazy to let her know it's good. Then after feeding, take her out immediately as well. Anytime you are not actively playing with her or she is not eating, she should be crated. It shouldn't take too long to house train her using this method. Good luck!|`|8f1a3fcf108593e595fa6e5afb008a9eaa	LOL about the shirt thing.

That will cure a surprising # of diarrhea cases, especially if they were caused by eating all kinds of Thanksgiving food her stomach wasn't used to.  If she starts acting sick, or still has diarrhea tomorrow, then she needs to go to the vet.  If she stops having diarrhea, then start giving her small amts chicken and rice tomorrow (broil the chicken or use a can of white meat chicken- the goal is to make it low fat).  Give her a little every few hours.  As long as she keep it down and the diarrhea doesn't return, gradually increase the amt you give her, then transition her back to her regular food.

694c151586a2e668b071364887958430aa	I just had both cataracts taken out of my teacup poodle.  She'd had them since I got her 2 1/2 years ago from a shelter--and maybe for years before that.  So I'm not sure why you have only two weeks to decide...you should ask your vet why the time limit--she may have a good reason.  Maybe the cataracts are growing so fast that the eyes will be damaged.<br>  <br>  You could have just one eye done, although it's cheaper to have both done at once, than to have them each done on separate occasions.  <br>  <br>  There are lens implants available for dogs, but they aren't absolutely necessary.  Dogs who just have the cataracts removed, with no implants, have "getting around vision"--blurry, but they can distinguish objects and between light and dark.  Having the implants put in will increase the cost of the surgery, so you should ask what the price will be with and without implants.<br>  <br>  If you decide not to have it done, and both cataracts become complete, you will have a young, blind dog.  Cataracts left in place can luxate (or slip out of place), cause lens-induced uveitis, or other problems.  So it may be that you will have to have the surgery done in the future anyway, and the eyes or your dog might not be as healthy as they are now.<br>  <br>  Blind dogs can get around just fine with some adjustments.  They don't have the same attachment to their vision as we do.<br>  But if you can avoid having your dog go blind, that would be the best option.  Maybe the clinic offers a payment plan.<br>  <br>  And I can't emphasize this enough:  HAVE THE SURGERY DONE BY A VETERINARY OPHTHALMOLOGIST!!!!!!!   This surgery requires special skills, training, and equipment and the eyes are not very forgiving for poorly-performed surgeries.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1909d02279c114b441a9e48dfa30204daa	I don't understand why it will be too late to do surgery, but there are a lot of dogs that have cataracts and live well.  It depends somewhat on how blind she is.  If they totally obscure her vision, that may have more of an impact than if they are only partially obscuring her vision.  Still, there are a lot of totally blind dogs.  If she isn't a nervous type of dog, and you can keep her surroundings stable so she can get around, she will probably do okay.  Blind dogs take extra care, though, to keep them out of trouble- for instance, if they are allowed to wander off, they can't find their way home, and sometimes people who don't know a dog is blind get scared because it looks weird and can be cruel.  Of course the best thing is usually to remove them, but surgery is expensive and is not without risks.   Good Luck!!|`|24457376cb5cf833a3c6f509ac556bc2aa	It may not be cheap and it may not seem necessary but it is the kindest thing to do for your dog. Without the surgery your dog will go blind. I had a dog much older than yours that was not a candidate for surgery and she lead a miserable life after going blind. Don't do this to your dog she is still young.|`|AA11761734	ummmmm, i don't think so.|`|127879a936c132efbe66f0e7a95f061faa	Just like with humans, cataracts in dogs will cause blindness. Growing up our beagle got cataracts but it wasn't until she was almost 14 years old. We decided against the surgery, feeling it was too risky at her age. As the cataracts got worse she would become more aggressive, barking at everyone until she realized who you were. Occasionally she would trip on the stairs but never got hurt. <br>  <br>  I know the surgery is expensive, but at 7 years old your dog has a lot of years left. Perhaps you could check out other vets and find one to do the surgery cheaper. If not, maybe your vet would let you do a payment plan, mine has in the past.|`|AA11105335	I have some links to organizations that may be able to help. I'm not positive, but it's worth a try for you and your dog.<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|ee0f2ba9b89a043d0e71eaabc247cf75aa	I was in the same situation as you, only my dog was 2 years old.  I really looked into the pros and cons and the cons outweighed the pros.  <br>  <br>  I didn't do the surgery on my dog, only because there were more cons then pros in my dogs case ( complications of complet vision loss, death during surgery, ocular infections, vision only partially restored and no garentee the cateracts will not come back).  <br>  <br>  I would consider it more seriouse if they believe its could contribute to glaucoma, but it varies from patient to patient.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the quality of life for your pet.  His vision might be slightly impared but I don't think that will dramatically effect his quality of life, esp. if you don't have 1,600 to throw into the wind, in hopes 6 to 12 moths later the cateracts don't come back.  <br>  <br>  I would research it more with the for the reasons why your dog has cateracts, if age isn't the only contributing factor.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.

1909d02279c114b441a9e48dfa30204daa	I would recommend having it done as soon as you can.  Even a partial tear can lead to joint instability, which will cause arthritis.  Then when you do have the surgery done, your dog may have residual lameness from the arthritis.  Also, if he is favoring the injured leg, he could rupture the ACL in his other leg, which would mean a second surgery and a more difficult recovery.  If your vet won't do it, seek a second opinion.  Good Luck!!.|`|a970644a172e450d6f341157b06744b2aa	I agree with the previous post.

Do this several times. When he can tolerate this increase the time to 15 or 20 minutes and when he tolerates this increase the time to a half hour or 45 minutes and so on until he can tolerate being alone without you for an hour or more.

Give him the food inside of the play fence, and only take him out to do his doggy business, or to play outside.<br>  <br>  This will make him realize that he should not be so dependant on you and thus will stop him from following you all the time. Another good thing to do is to buy another dog, or easier, a toy. Usually they follow you because they don't have anything, or anyone, to play with except for you. <br>  <br>  It really depends on the dog's age. Did you buy him as a pup, or the adoption center. With this you can tell why he follows you around. Sometimes concerning the adoption, he may have had a traumatic experience and that may be the reason for following ou, or it might not be. I also suggest training him, this keeps him disciplined.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your dog ^^|`|ee13467362ea156e50f5ecd63d7c5893aa	Hi, I would suggest getting another dog as a companion to your clingy one.  It will give him someone to play with and focus on instead of you.  Make sure they meet and like each other before you make the commitment.  If you dog is not crazy about other dogs, he will still most likely accept a puppy.  After getting the second dog, you must remember to show more attention to your 1st dog always and things should go well.<br>  Bobbie

I always thought that dogs just inhaled their food like you see on the pet food commercials on tv. Mine's never done that, and he's a pretty hardy dog. He just eats once a day (in the evening). I've tried him on several different foods too. It surprised me when he settled in with regular Purina Dog Chow. Every once in a while he gets a little bored with it and I change it over to Beneful. Do the different brands that you try still have the same main ingredient? Are they generally beef, lamb, chicken? Maybe it's not so much the brands that he doesn't like, but the main ingredients? Just a thought.

Your dog was just done differently for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  As for feeding him, you should pick a good quality food and stick with it.  Changing his food is going to give him diarrhea as well as contribute to his pickiness.  What you can do is add a little oil (about 1 tablespoon) to his food which is great for his skin and coat.  Also, you can mix in a bit of low-fat cottage cheese or some no-fat, no-sugar yogurt (it's good for digestion), a few vegetables, or you could mix in a bit of canned food to get him to eat.  <br>  <br>  I also don't agree with taking a dog's food away after a couple of minutes, try giving him more time.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	the neuter is done the same way as a cat.   the sack is cut and  the testicles are removed and stitched   the sack will get smaller and smaller in till it is level with the body.       pick a good quilaty food and put it down and give him 5 min. eat and then pick it up and  feed it again at next feeding after two days he should start eating what you give him.  you can e-mail me if you have any more questions

This will help you get the most out of your investment. The type you choose will depend on your lifestyle, your dog’s behavioral patterns and what type of activities you plan to do with your pet.<br>  If you’re not planning on traveling with your dog a basic wire crate is a good choice for an everyday crate. If you're going to keep it in one place you probably don't need a collapsible model.<br>  If you have a growing puppy select a crate that your puppy will grow into. Make sure it comes with a divider panel, which will allow you to adjust the size of the crate as your puppy grows.<br>  It’s highly recommended that you crate your dog while traveling by car. You may be able to purchase a crate that you can use at home as well as in your car....Please loor article: <a href="http://www.askedweb.com/askedweb/Selecting_Dog_Crates_Isn%E2%80%99t_Difficult_When_You_Ask_The_Right_Questions/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askedweb.com/askedweb/Selecti...</a><br>  As you can see, choosing the right dog carrier depends on your dog’s size and temperament, the intended location and use, and the function and features that you expect the carrier to fulfill. Choose the dog carrier, kennel, or dog crate that best suits your needs and how you see the crate functioning. You’ll want to pick the one that offers the most convenience for the uses that you have in mind.

So a medium crate is not going to last him very long. Otherwise you're just going to have to upgrade in 6 months.<br>  <br>  I used X-large Vari-Kennel (Crates) for my dobermans, so I would recommend a large. Even at WalMart, you are looking at about $60-$70 depending on style.<br>  <br>  Check you local newspapers.<br>  If you find a used one, make sure you disinfect it thoroughly.|`|AA11765670	I got my crates from Walmart.  Even though two of my dogs are big, I had to get several different crates as they grow.  you don't want to get one too big.  Yard sales is another way to get one cheaper.

If I called the dog tripod it might be cute in the tone I would use. Dogs don't understand English they attach meanings to sounds.

NQqYDsE6aa	I'm assuming you mean that the actual nose leather is dry on the outside? If so, that is normal for most dogs and you don't need to worry about it. <br>  <br>  If the nose leather feels hot, you might want to check puppy's temperature, as hot nose leather and bright pink ears (on the inside) can be indicators of a temperature. <br>  <br>  If you're worried about dehydration, you can carefully pull up puppy's skin on his back. If it stays up for a bit before "snapping" back down onto his back, he is dehydrated and needs more water. If it goes right back, he's fine.<br>  <br>  Since you're a novice dog owner, you may want to consider a general dog forum or a breed specific forum or Yahoo Group for help and advice. That can be very useful and help keep you from tearing out your hair at the roots over dog issues. There are also a lot of good books out there - check some of them out and purchase some of them. "Dogs for Dummies" would be a good starter, and "The First Aid Companion for Cats and Dogs" should be in every dog owner's library in case you ever face medical issues.

Does the dog have any other signs of illness?  Lethargy?  Dogs noses are wet to increase their sense of smell.  If you are really concerned, take him to the vet.  If he/she is a puppy, I'm sure you'll be getting shots and deworming, and regular check ups.  As far as drinking enough, do you see him/her drinking? Some dogs drink more than others, watch to see if he/she drinks anything, also check the urine color (if you can see it) if it is dark yellow, there is something wrong and he/she is not getting enough water.  If it is light yellow to clear - he/she is getting plenty of water.<br>  <br>  However, prolonged dry, cracked skin on the nose, with discoloration, scabs or open sores is not normal. If his/her nose is warm and dry for a prolonged period of time, it could be a sign of illness.  Get him to a vet.|`|89bedcaf6ce6df65fe1e65dd07ce2a69aa	a dry nose may not mean anything there nose may get wet when they are palying it almost like when we sweat|`|8fed5e76b23f1370f7f5bd5cec6b95cfaa	It doesn't matter, as long as its wet in the inside of his/her nose.|`|BIXFVpVxaa	if he has been eating and drinking well he is just fine if not he is dehydrated and if he will not drink maybe put some flavored water into his to make it more appealing
MUkl4cowaa	You should not breed a female dog until she is atleast 2 years of age.  any younger and you could run into complications which may result in you loosing the pups as well as the mother....... is it worth it.   Plus a female will only let the male breed with her if SHE is ready not YOU.....or him.   As far as her mounting him She is showing dominance, and is not mature enought to know they are different (male/female).  Also note:   Puppies are cute but VERY expensive to breed....... With boxers you have tail docking, and possibly ears, shots as well as general vet checks just to start.   And what if there are complications are you prepared to spend the money on Emergency if necessary........ Do the research before the act........ Your pup is like a 7 year old child do you still want your child to have children......???|`|AA11284584	Six months is too young to start breeding your female.

But the behavior she is portraying ("...trying to get on top of the male and acts the way the male should...") is simply showing her dominance over the male.  She is trying to be superior to him and  is showing that by mounting him.  Dogs will do this to eachother to show who's boss between them.  Yea, it might be gross, but that's nature for ya....|`|Lib9M0y3aa	learn about breeding dogs for the next 1 1/2 years first. way to young to breed.|`|ae108db02c12ef58e1d75f3c981eba34aa	For one thing don't let your dog breed at six months.. that is way to young and many things can go wrong with mommy and puppies.  You need to wait until she is two years old before you breed her.  Never breed a six month  old dog.. I hope it is not to late for you to stop this..But really you should have known better than let her have puppies at that age.|`|yQOuTpHfaa	THE FEMALE IS WAY TO YOUNG TO BREED!!!!! You need to talk to the vet and get some advice on proper breeding procedures.  If you were to let her get pregnant now it could be very harmfull and possibly deadly at her age!

SqDdnSqtaa	It really depends on the wording of the law. Some make the breed outright illegal to own, others permit ownership, but the dogs must be muzzled when in public. Still others specify that the dogs must be neutered/spayed. Oh, and if you think it just applies to those "fighting breeds" like pit bulls (of course if you know anything about the breed history fighting came more recently and this wasn't the specific purpose)...<br>   <br>  " that owns a purebred or mixed dog that looks like it might be one of the targeted breeds. These dogs include Jack Russell Terriers, Lab mixes, Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, American Bulldogs, Bull Terriers, Doberman Pinschers,  and many other breeds."<br>  <br>  A little research will reveal how many other breeds are slowly being snuck into these laws. There are states working on labling Grate Danes, St. Berrnards and Labs as dangerous. Yeah you read right, LABS! These states will require the spay/neutering of these breeds with NO EXCEPTION to show dogs. The problem with BSL is that it lables a breed but does nothing to curb irresponsible dog ownership. It just pacifies people into thinking that something is being done to prevent a dog attack when in fact they still happen in areas that have BSL in place. Do you think people who keep vicious dogs will just give up? Nope, we will just be talking about banning another breed, no more pet dogs ,no more pet cats, no more pets,and then PETA wins(this is the main agenda of PETA mind you). And it all starts with banning the first breed, after that the rest is easy, think about it...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chako.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chako.org/index.html</a>|`|AA11826043	This is from my blog, it is a freelance piece I wrote about this crises.

Then we had a visitor who picked her up by her front legs.  Really hurt her badly, she was months reover from the torn muscles.  She was never freindly to strangers again.  <br>  <br>  The Dog whisperer has a couple episodes on dogs like her.  Your dog is part of your family.  She needs obieience school.  <br>  <br>  I have 12 dogs of all sizes.  I have a squirt bottle filled with plain old water.  When my dogs misbehave I give them a squirt with the water.  Not in the face.  Just a squirt.  Most of the time all I have to doo is look like I am going for the water bottle.  <br>  <br>  A Maltese is a tiny dog.  Too small to hit in anyway shape or fomr.  If you or any of your family have been hitting her this may be part of the trouble.  It is possible she was injured or really firghtened by one of you visitors.  ARe thiere kids in you rfamily?  It may be that the children at too chaotic for her.  Keep in mind that to a dog the size of a Maltese people are the size of skyscrapers, moving skyscrapers. Think about it a few mintues and you will see how she could be very frightened.  And how too much confusion would effect her very negatively.  These tiny dogs are just not for evey one or evey home.<br>  <br>  I feel so sorry for your dog.  About to loose her home and family and she wil never be able to understand why.|`|1909d02279c114b441a9e48dfa30204daa	Have you done any training or socialization with her?  Did you do any obedience classes when she was younger?  If not, then you have created this behavior, but that doesn't mean you can't change it, at least somewhat.  You need to be willing to spend some time and money working with a good trainer.  If this isn't possible, I would think twice about trying to give her away-- chances are no one else wants a crazy dog either, and she could end up in an abusive home, or you could get sued if she injures someone.  If she is aggressive enough to bite without provocation, then you should consider euthanasia.  I know it sounds harsh, but there isn't much place for aggressive dogs in our society, especially not in families with children.  You can also look for a Maltese rescue group and they might be able to help you too. Just be sure anyone you give her to really understands her problems.  Good Luck.|`|19d47e8f293e0b25e6346d7e02e94d3daa	Don't give her away unless you are giving her to a trainer that deals with aggressive dogs.....your dog is a serious liability, because she could bite someone which would result in criminal charges and/or civil suits against you. I have been in the same situation as you.....try contacting everyone  you can, not just us here at Yahoo Answers....call all over for dog trainers, behaviorists, veterinarians, etc. There are many causes and treatments for aggressive behavior. For example, there are a few medications available: xanax (only as needed), prozac (daily), and clomicalm (daily). Prozac and xanax are dirt cheap...clomicalm costs a little bit more. <br>  <br>  The first step is to determine whether the cause is neurological (a chemical imbalance, for example) or behavioral (poor socialization, bad training, etc.), but it is usually both so you want to treat the problem comprehensively. Contact a vet and have an appointment to get your dog on medications. Next, contacting a behaviorist is very important, because he/she will be able to find the behavioral cause of your dog's behavior and treat it appropriately. A trainer is another option, but if the trainer doesn't work, go for the behaviorists. Behaviorists will be recommended by your vet, and also work in private practice or at vet schools. There are also many aggressive dog trainers (they train police dogs, guard dogs, etc), and I"m sure there is one in your state near you.<br>  <br>  Please realize that although she is not biting you now, and she is protective, she may eventually go after you. I haven't evaluated your dog, so I don't know if her condition is neurological or behavioral or both. Only the vets and behaviorists will be able to assess that. Some people you talk to may say to euthanize her. For me, euthanasia is a final option, and should only be used if all other attempts towards treatment have failed and all the professionals say it is your only option. Sometimes, aggressiveness is able to be treated (easily or somewhat difficultly), so it is important to not give up on her.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!|`|319c2ab90128a91e508500878bc495bbaa	Shes just trying to protect you the only thing you can do is bring her to obidence school.|`|AA10099648	I have two Maltese.

You need to let her know YOU are the LEADER, not her. If I didn't stay on mine they would take over too. The Maltese is a super intelligent dog. <br>  <br>  The person that said to use the water sprayer is correct. DON'T EVER HIT HER. You don't have to hit her to make her see she is not the boss. Every time she does something wrong spray the water at her and just yell, "NO"! Just use that one word whenever she misbehaves.  Don't mix anything in the bottle, just plain tap water. Change it once a week and rinse it out.<br>  <br>  Mine would run me if they could. Use the bottle and the word. Have someone come over and see what she does. It won't take many times and she will stop. BUT you have to be consistent and NEVER allow her to get away with it. That is why I asked how many live with you.

I wish you well and if you need help look to Cesar Millan. He has a website and he is amazing with dogs.
bbdee6c30e5c509fe8caa44506c8ea1aaa	It could be seasonal allergies or environmental allergies, or it could be anxiety or boredom. Without knowing more information, it's impossible to tell. Try eliminating things from his diet, such as treats  and table scraps. Try taking a look at your schedule, too. Did it recently change, where the dog might be stressed out? Did anything in the house change? Things that you might think are small can be a big deal to pets. Some dogs are allergic to wheat. Many dog foods and treats contain wheat. Or it could be dry skin due to the winter... homes that heat with forced air have very dry humidity. There are so many things that it could be, which is usually why it's also difficult for a vet to figure out what's wrong.|`|AA11898333	It may have to do with the humidity in your house.  Dogs can get dry skin just like people in the winter time.  <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions, but not necessarily quick fixes:<br>  <br>  - de-humidifier for when the heat is on in the house<br>  - hypo-allergenic (oatmeal) shampoo or any other type of relief shampoo<br>  - medicated anti-itch spray<br>  <br>  All of these things can be found at almost any store.  If none of these things help, then yes... you'll need to go to the vet, yet again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	He could have environmental/Inhalant atopic alergies. Both my dogs have allergies, one is allergic to something in his environment and other is allergic to beef. The food allergy is much easier to treat, because as long as he does not eat beef he is fine. However my Lab is allergic to something in the environment and I am pretty sure it is dust. He gets worse everytime the heat kicks on when it has been off for awhile, and he does it with the air conditioner too. But I have been around and around with the vets to No satisfication. The Benedryl never worked nor did the steroids. They all had nasty side effects and did not give him any relief. I feed my dogs holistic foods so I decided to try and treat him with holistic medicines and it WORKS 100% better with no side effects, Go to an all natural pet store or www.azmira.com there is Allerg'Free and Yucca Intensive the 2 together help so much. For the itching I use Richard's Incredible Organic Itch spray, and this is the most amazing stuff. I tried every thing on the market to stop the itching and baldness but nothing worked until I started using this. It has antiboitic properties so it prevents infection if your dog as created a wound. From the moment it goes on it works wonderfully. <br>  Just like us getting allergy outbreaks at different times of the year so does a dog with allergies, it is easier to help if you know what causes it. So it would make sense that your dog has outbreaks at certain times of the year.

AVcTCrSGaa	Mmmm...the vet says she is okay?  If she's not losing weight, she must be eating something.  You may need to try different types of dog food.  I have two cats and when we got them (at 4 months old) they had been eating too many table scraps and one of them wouldn't touch cat food.  I thought he was going to starve...he got SO skinny!  But I did not give in and after trying several brands of food, I finally found one that he will eat!  I admit, it's an expensive process but if your dog isn't sick, she's probably just picky.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	try feeding twice a day.   put the amount of food you wish to feed  down in the morning  and evening.  give her about 5 min to eat the food  and if she walk away from the food then pick it up and try again in the evening.  she will start to eat when she is hungry. please find a good quality food please and just feed the dry kibble.|`|WEvHjYh8aa	I have a pit too! She's alittle picky! If the vet says she's healthy than that's good! I beat a raw egg up once a week and mix it with her food! She loves it! It's good for her coat and muscles!

I would buy a small bad of another kind of food, and see how she likes it until you find one she wants to eat. Our dogs were like that, we bought beneful, and thats the one they liked, and stuck with, all the other brands(more expensive brands)they didnt like. So really if she is healthy just buy some small bags of different brands until you find one she likes.|`|0d228d06221d0c3678d71b67d8a7f016aa	depending on how long ur dog has not eatin. if he/she has not eatin in more than 2 days take him to the vet n if it was just a while give him sum time then take him to the vet if does not eat!|`|19e3717a8feeffe83cf67c210d01eb66aa	If the vet says she's healthy, then you have nothing to worry about. Pups are like kids, they won't let themselves starve. Just make sure you always have food out for when she does get hungry. Try switching her food too, but not all at once. you have to mix it and eventually give her the new food. just switching abruptly can make her stomach upset.|`|Ca96U72Kaa	i have a dog that doesn't like to eat too, I have to pick up everything and put it in her mouth, every single bite, otherwise she just walks away and one of the other dogs eats it|`|llzWui7daa	Get some chicken liver and boil it.  let it cool for about 5 mins, and then feed it to him/her.

When they are teething, they eat less, and when it is turning to spring, they cut down significantly on their food..<br>  <br>  Be ware of the new recalls now..<br>  <br>  Blue Buffalo recalls products<br>  Wilbur-Ellis Co., the U.S. importer of the tainted rice protein, said Thursday it was recalling all the ingredient it had distributed to five U.S. pet food manufacturers. The San Francisco company in turn urged its customers to recall any products that may be on store shelves.<br>  <br>  So far, just two of those companies have done so: Natural Balance Pet Foods and Blue Buffalo Co.<br>  <br>  Natural Balance, of Pacoima, Calif., announced a limited recall Monday of its Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food.<br>  <br>  Blue Buffalo, of Wilton, Conn., followed Thursday by recalling 5,044 bags of its Spa Select Kitten dry food.

Between the Labs being "puppies" till they're about two years old, and the Border Collie having stamina and intelligence like you wouldn't believe, you may be infor a challenge to keep him from getting bored.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	Just from the border collie side, you will have your hands FULL!  BC's are smart and highly active.  They typically need more than just the daily walk too.  They need mental stimulation to keep them truly happy.  A bored BC is going to find ways to entertain themself and this often leads to destruction in the home.  This breed needs a job...  and they excel at dog sports such as agility, frisbee and flyball.  They're obsessive and neurotic at times and they will drive you crazy pestering you to death for some play time.  Training, for something more advanced like obedience competition, is a really good idea as it helps with giving them some mental stimulation.<br>  <br>  So depending on how much of the Border Collie is in your mixed breed, be prepared... they are way more work than the average dog!|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	they are mixed breeds not purebreed.  they could be like the labrador or like the border collie       the border will need a lot of things to do or will find things to do that you will not like.    labs can be hipper dogs also.    you will need to take the dog to obedience class as soon as you get the dog.     i hope you are not pay very much for this mixed breed dog.    if you are adopting it you will have to have it spayed if they do not do it.|`|73gWmEgeaa	I actually adopted a lab / border collie mix myself.  His name is Tucker and he is 18 mos. now.  He is awesome, he's actually a lot less hyper than my pure bred lab and he sheds less too.  He is very smart and very sweet, likes to cuddle and give kisses.  He doesn't care about chasing a tennis ball but he'll tear after a frisbee.  He learns commands and new tricks quickly. He is a little reserved when he meets new people but once he decides your O.K. he is very friendly.  Tucker does like to "chew" so I keep a lot of different types of chew toys around for him. So far I haven't had any health issues but, hip dysplasia is always something to look out for in any large size breed.  My labs have gotten ear infections on occasion but so far no problem with Tucker.  I wouldn't trade him for anything. Enjoy your new pup.|`|IYyQMtKaaa	it's not a designer dog it's called a mutt.what's wrong with a full blood dog? i hope you didn't pay any money for it.|`|dcc5ad8fb6e7603baf057f34e32833e0aa	Wow, you're brave !<br>  <br>  I have a border - Smart as a whip, an ACTIVE - extremely loyal and loving - prefers only 1 boss - so decide who in your household is in charge.

77691785155ac844fcded5bfc8765990aa	The key is properly training your dog. Staffies are great family dogs. You didn't mention if it was a pup or a rescue. Either way I never leave young children alone in a room with any dogs. My dogs are well trained, I am just overly cautious.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	Personally I love the Staffies.  I think they look great and have wonderful character.  I do however hate pit bulls and think they should be banned.  I know they are similiar and some believe the staffie is the pit bull with a better temprement.  I don't know about that but I do know that a staffie is less likely to attack a human than a pit bull is.  I guess this debate comes down to interpretation.  Anyway -  I think you have a great choice of dog.  These dogs are loyal, loving and protective.  I do however know of three staffies that are dog aggressive.  This again is a serious problem but I own an Akita.  Akita's are dog aggressive also but I have socialied him really well and all he wants to do is play, play, play.  I believe that if a dog is aggressive towards other dogs it's down to the owners and not the particular dog, (except in pit bulls).    Anyway - Well done great choice of dog.|`|132f9cce39ae4a3e8ea480d899cca790aa	Ok My thoughts on any breed of dog is that the owner is what helps make the dog what it is or isn't. I have owned many bulldog breeds or had hands on with them thorough volunteering at shelters. I honestly believe that all bulldog breeds are getting a bad name due to ignorant people not understanding that these dogs that have attacked were typically not in a family setting but either unsocialized and thrown on a chain or even worse abused or fought. I have a pit bull at this time that is 1 year old that I adopted and didn't know any of her history but truly knowing the breed I knew how to watch for her signs of aggression and so far she has done great with my 5 year old and 1 year old. I do advise to get an amstaff pup if you decide to get an amstaff just so you can teach him or her to be calm around your children not due to the fear of it attacking biut the high energy level the amstaff breed has because the are still terriers which means a high play drive and easy to knock a small child over and lick. <br>  <br>  <br>  Quick note <br>  Due to the wide spread pitbull ban if there is one in your area this  does include amstaffs because they are a pitbull breed as well.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	your staffy should be a great dog if you train it the right way. some people may not rember that pit bull come from a mixter of staffy and  other breeds of the same type of dog.  dog and people aggressive dogs are aloud to be that way because people make them that way. make sure that you take your dog to obedience training class. if youb are not already doing so.|`|AA11597202	Most of the problems are down to the owners letting the dog get dominant - no training.

Pit Bulls are also a lot of work, and need a lot of exercise, and room to run. So if you are planning to have 3 dogs make sure they are all fixed.|`|e3MEc2KSaa	You may have no problems at all, but you own some very aggresive breeds or are about to, the person that said a pit is just another dog was correct in the fact that yes it is a dog, but this is a very powerfull breed in fact all 3 are.  and if there is a conflict it will not be good if you have ever seen a pit or american bulldog fight trust me you dont want that to happen, then you get in the middle of it and you get hurt not that the dog meant to hurt you, they dont even know what they are doing at that point, in my humble opinion you would be playing with fire.|`|ee924070953658265c515090c8cc5139aa	I know Pit bulls get a bad rap and are most likely loving pets.

gqjrBmu1aa	The fastest way I've learned is doing a lot of flexon exercises. When your horse masters lateral flexion, you can practice horizontally. Pick the reins up about 5 inchs in front of your saddle horn and gently pull up and back. Your horse may want to back up at first just as he wanted to move in a circle when you did this laterally. Simply just tell him whoa but do not drop the reins as your horse may think that this is your cue to back up and think that by you releasing pressure you are rewarding him. All of my horses picked up the horizontal flexion easy after they had gotten the lateral down.<br>  <br>  When you've gotten your horse to gently tuck his head under with little force and just the simple lifting of the reins start him doing this at the walk. You always start at the walk. You'll notice the difference immediatly with his head tucked at the walk. This will slow his forehand and cause him to use his hindquarters. The best way you can tell if he is collecting himself properly is if you feel like you are going up-hill as when he is collected his hindquarters will fall under his body as he uses his hind legs to push rather than his forelimbs pull.<br>  Once you've gotten this down at the walk- move up to a trot and then lope. Pretty soon you'll notice the nice shape that your horses rump is changing into, you'll be able to ride longer because having your horse collected will be easier on his body and maybe even yours. And another perk- you'll notice transitions, lead changes, roll backs, and even stopping will become easier. <br>  I hope this helps, good luck and happy trails.|`|ZB8x6HOzaa	The thing to remember with a green horse is that consistency is key. You need to ask him to collect the same way every time you ride, and eventually the message will sink in. Now, some people will recommend draw reins or other gadgets, but unless you are working with a professional trainer, I advise you stay away from these artificial aides as they could prevent a hollowed-out bend, not true collection. Instead, here an exercise I use to teach collection.<br>  <br>  Pick up a sitting trot on a 30 meter circle. The goal is to get your horse balanced and collected throughout the whole circle. Ask for collection and bend by sliding your outside leg back behind the girth and riding with your inside leg at the girth. Your inside hand should come slightly toward your inside knee (not much, just that general direction). Your outside rein should be held in the direction of your hip. Squeeze your legs into your horse's side and keep a constant firm pressure on the reins. Don't haul on his mouth, just keep the pressure even. He might toss his head or try to speed up. Don't let him speed, and don't fight if he tries to toss his head. Just keep a firm, steady hand. He'll fight with himself for a second, then he should drop his head. The moment he relaxes, ease up the pressure on the reins and reward him. He may only take a few steps before his head shoots up again, then repeat the exercise. This will take some time. He needs to build up the muscles. Spend about ten or fifteen minutes going both ways on the circle, then give him a loose rein and let him stretch out for a few minutes. It's a simple exercise, but difficult to master. This is how I taught my OTTB to collect and balance, it really worked for me and the horses I've trained. Once he can collect on the circle, you can practice doing figure eights and serpentines and going down the long side of the arena. Remember, be satisfied with small progress and baby steps. There are no short cuts.|`|BoT5zWhtaa	drive him into the bit, and back back back|`|QIDWaHsNaa	Have you tryed driving him?

619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	the best way is to find a dog obedience trainer in your area.   the dog need basic training before you start fetch training.|`|a6e32f83bd9df3cd5c5301fb5f669903aa	Work on this when the dog is hungry. Have a pocket or hand full of dry dog food. Whether you begin working inside or outside, you will want to work in an area where he does not have wide open space to run, and not a lot of distractions.  <br>  <br>  Toss his favorite toy or whatever, and when he goes and picks it up, and comes running back near you, drop a couple of pieces of food on the floor by your feet.  He will drop the toy and eat the food. Say the verbal command "fetch" or "go fetch". Repeat this exercise as many times as possible. It may take several sessions before he will retrieve an item and drop it at your feet on command. Once he has learned, it won't hurt at all to reinforce the training using the food or treats once in a while.<br>  <br>  You do not have to have specific "basic" training to teach a dog anything, except perhaps in the case of "do or don't" commands such as "bark/don't bark", "take it/drop it". In such cases the dog should learn one before learning the other.<br>  <br>   When you are training a dog, what you are really doing is CONDITIONING them. Yes, it's desireable to get certain training out of the way first so that your dog is easier to live with, but you can condition a dog to fetch on command even if he is not conditioned, for example, to lie down on command.|`|GJMx4POeaa	throw the bone and teach the dog how to fetch it
8034835c66d2e724900f993d1409feadaa	We have a hybrid "breeder" (and I use this term loosely) in our neighborhood. He is an idiot. All of his dogs are constantly sick. And the "healthy" ones keep getting out & terrorizing the neighborhood. I agree, they are beautiful dogs, but you can rarely find one that is predictable. He will not listen to veterinary advise, is constantly fighting parvo, and neighbors throwing poison into his yard. This moron actually believes that wolves and wolf hybrids have two stomachs, and therefore, should only be treated with holistic methods. But he always comes crawling for vet help when he has one at deaths door. And then, when it is saved from parvo, or whatever garbage the neighbors keep throwing inside of his fence, it ends up hit by a car, or shot while trying to kill someones pet or livestock. I know there are probably responsible hybrid owners out there somewhere, but this fool has left me feeling disgusted, and sorry for the poor dogs.

Alaskan Malamutes can be very hard to handle and need a lot of exercise. They need large, securely fenced backyards, they need experienced people to handle them. They are very strong and I personally would not recommend a Malamute for an old person. A Great Dane would make and excellent dog. They are very big and need a lot of space, food and exercise. You should ONLY even CONSIDER buying either of these breeds from a REPUTABLE breeder as these dogs are prone to MANY genetic diseases. <br>  <br>  Great Danes have very short hairs and will need to be a family dog; living inside, especially during the winter.<br>  Alaskans are snow dogs.

But from your own experience working with dogs, you know how important a good match between owner and dog can be.

Weather can always be worked around with proper shelter, but a bad match with your grandmother couldn't be.  Please consider letting her make this choice with you.|`|cpPjXUmFaa	How about a Lab, or a Golden Retriever?!  Just kidding...The Great Dane's get really really big.

I'd go with the Great Dane.|`|qa5Rl7QUaa	I love all pretty much all dogs, but you do have a valid question for both breeds. Considering that your grandma's only 4'9" a Great Dane may be a bit too much for her. On the other hand a Malamute needs a lot of running/exercise room. If it helps you, I used to have a Siberian Husky and I'm from Southern CA where the summer gets pretty hot. My poor dog would be panting during the time, but he made it up to 16 before he passed.

84bebe9d1cd0026e8fb8343c9b375525aa	I have a dog with many allergies. I would reccomend taking him to your local vet and getting him allergie tested. Since he is only 9 weeks old he could be forming allergies to something outside early such as grass, a certain flower and a tree that is around your house. Our dog is allergic to a certain tree and moss so you never know what your dog is going to be allergic to. He could even be allergic to human dander. Our dog is! We had never heard of that before our dog. The vet will give you shots to give your dog monthly to take most of the allergies away. good luck. Hope this helps!|`|ZUx5DBzWaa	I have a beagle that has allergies she is 8 years old.

0dbcab5a78b72d97386463d98eaa4726aa	There really is no difference between the 2. The bite force could be explained as the dog's initial impact, his entry into the bite and his desire to bite. Pressure is just that, pressure during the bite. There is absolutely no correlation between the breeds you mentioned and bite power. The pressure will depend on what "drive" the dog was in when engaging. Bites out of "prey drive" are the hardest ones in any dog because to let go means no food. Defense bites are violent and hard, but not as hard as prey. Fight drive bites are also hard, but more controlable. There are some big, huge dogs whom you think would break a limb if they bite and they really do not do much. There are little dogs, "60 pounds" that bite like the devil and you will lose a body part if they do not come off. The bottom line is that the force of the bite is depended upon the dog's HEART. A bite is not something that you can teach a dog to do harder, a dog is born with the desire to have a full, crushing bite and no amount of training is going to make him bite harder if his heart is not in it. <br>  PS. The hardest bite I have ever felt in many years of having hundreds of dogs bite me, came from a 55-60 pound malinois that I swore would take my leg off with that bite. I still have the scar, through a bite suit years later.|`|KsJHl4pCaa	Don't fight dogs!|`|SfiSMFGSaa	i hope you're not planning to use dogs to fight|`|0xJZJggVaa	Yeah, this is pretty much a myth.

By exercising your dog right before bedtime you aare speeding up the metabolism  which includes potty functions. As your dog gets older you should be able to sleep through the night. You may want to take up the water dish after 7pm and cut back on the exercise just before bedtime....although a sleepy dog is a good dog.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	how much are you feed him?    what kind of dog is he?

A lot of breeders vaccinate at 6 weeks too, but the puppies are still getting protection from the antibodies in their mothers milk. Those antibodies start wearing off at around 7-8weeks so that is when you need to vaccinate so that way their isnt a gap in protection. If you vaccinate at 6 weeks the vaccine is really kind of pointless because it doesnt really help protect it because they are already protected. Its kind of like giving the puppy the shot one day and then a few days later giving it again, it really doesnt protect it any better. The puppy shots are done in a series of usually three shots each 1 month apart. That is because each shot protects them for about 1month before its effectiveness wears off so you again need to booster a month after the first shot, and so on. The puppy isnt really safe from the diseases like parvo until it is fully boostered. They have some protection from each shot and each shot adds more protection until after the 3rd set when they are considered fully vaccinated. The vaccines usually inclue Distemper, Hepatitis, Lepto, Parainfluenza, Parvo, and Corona virus protection. On the 3rd shots (16 weeks) they get their Rabies shot. Depending on the area they have a vaccine that protects the dog from Lyme disease (and the cool thing about that vaccine is that the shot neutralizes the disease in the tick so if the tick falls off after biting a vaccinated dog, the tick cant pass it on to you) also there is a nasal bordetella vaccine available to protect the puppy from kennel cough.  well if you have any other questions email me.

When they are 4 weeks or a bit older, you can start feeding puppy food. A high quality puppy food like Innova (dry) or California Natural (dry) would be best. You can either put the dry food in the blender and add a bit of warm water or you can just soak the kibble in some water (instead of blending it) until it's the consistency of porridge (oatmeal). Gradually, you can blend it/soak it less so that it's a bit harder. You should feed this until 7 1/2 weeks old. When they are almost ready to go to new homes, you can stop soaking the food and you can just give them normal kibble.|`|AA12398827	Yes, you can try starting them on puppy food moisten with water to make it soft because they arent able to chew well enough to break up the peices.

Get a high quality puppy food and put it in the blender to chop it up add just enough warm water to make a oatmeal like consistency.  then you can begin to feed your puppies that.

d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	First off do NOT buy hartz. Ive read many many articles saying that all the hartz products are dangerous and sometimes fatal towards animals. We recently had a flea problem with our 2 cats. We bathed them weekly, tried powders, sprays, flea traps, etc. nothing seemed to be working. Finally my grandma went to the vet and talked him into giving us some advantage. It works miracles, let me tell you. If you can, get this product. any fleas they have will die, then when fleas from around the house jump on your pets, they'll get sick and die too. your problem should clear up within a month. theres advantage, and advantix, make sure you get advantage. Its a bit pricey but it works! also dont mix the dog flea medication with the cats, or vice versa. this can cause your animals big problems. You're only suppose to be able to find advantage in an animal hospital, but the petco around here sells it in their store. its about 50 dollars. (Like i said, pricey....but its better than blowing hundreds on flea products that dont work).<br>  <br>  You should probably bathe them once with flea shampoo, just to get a head start and kill off as many fleas as possible..but after this just go with the advantage. I know plenty of people (ourselves included) that didnt have luck with anything else until they used this product.  We still occassionaly see a flea bite on the cats but its most likely just a flea that was left over, bit them, and got sick and died. Before they were covered in flea bites so this is a huge improvement. Also where ever you have fleas in your house, encourage your pets to go to these places (after you treat them, of course) the fleas will jump on them, bite, get sick, and die. Pretty soon you'll have gotten rid of your flea problem. It might take a couple months to completely get rid of it..but you'll notice a huge improvement right away.|`|8ceb62d4b80b19d9a1d44d5f1834737aaa	First off, take all bedding, yours and your animals, and machine wash them. Put your animals outdoors for the time being. Vaccuum your home thoroughly, including couches, carpets, beds, apolstery, floors, everything. Spray the home with Raid Flea Killer spray, spray everything, in the animals cages, your furniture, your floors and carpets, everything. Next step is to either dip or flea bathe your pets.  Using a sponge gets the shampoo or dip in better. Leave the shampoo on for a few minutes, or if you dipped your dog/cat, let him air dry, not rinsing the dip off of him. Now you can bring them indoors. Apply Frontline, best stuff out there.|`|34a57c291f9c1ba416922a9cadc97d48aa	Incorporate Garlic into their diet, it is a brilliant natural repellant|`|7a1a97b05947f9e6367106facb3184c1aa	I agree that advantage is probably the best.

AA12260609	so many people are fooled when a vet recommends science diet............. science diet is not promoted by the vet because it is a healthy food, it is promoted by the vet for the 40 percent profit that they are recieving on the dog food;. Sure, people will ask why does the vet recommend it if it is not a good dog food? well the answer to that one is, for the money........... They get a 40 percent profit on the food and if they recommended a true healthy diet they would not only not be needed for sick pets anymore, but because they would loose money.<br>  Alo6t of the health problems in dogs and cats come from the diet. If you feed a healthy food, then the dog will not need vet attention besides shots and wormed, and so many people even do that theirselves.<br>  <br>  raw is GREAT............

The healthiest food (I was so shocked when my vet told me) is actually IAMS.  It may have to grow on your dog, it's not kibble n bits.  But it's the best for the dog.  If you don't like that idea, the only other thing would be to buy the really small bags of food and try a different bag every time the first becomes empty until you find something it loves so much you can use it as a treat.  Be careful with treats... they throw off dogs digestive systems and cause bad poops.  You dislike diarreha and constipation and tummy craps, so will your dog.

863f9d322f5fa861f23223c0e93862a6aa	I don't know much about dog training but I know an old remedy for nail biters. The remedy was to scratch a bar of soap so you would have soap under your nails all day and never want to put them in your mouth. <br>  <br>  Now for your dog I think something similar would be an excellent cure for his hand biting. The first step would be for you and the other people who are around him most often to use this method (a bad tasting lotion might work but I think soap under your nails would be the best) and to also not encourage him when he does bite your hand. A stern no bad boy a long with the taste should quickly solve the problem. Hope this helps|`|7c000cf444eb1024a5936f1c7f912a15aa	I had an Akita that did that and it hurt, but after research I found out that it was a sign of affection.

If not, stop now and do not breed your dogs. Even if they are registered through a different registry, they are probably not "good" breeding material.<br>  <br>  Next, you must know the pedigrees of your dogs. If they do not have any champions in them, your pups are probably not worth breeding. Stop right there and do not breed your dogs.<br>  <br>  Third, check to verify if your dogs falls within breed standard set by the AKC. Go to AKC.org and check out your breed. If your dogs are in any way out of standard, do not breed them.<br>  <br>  Then, if the dogs do have champions in their lines, and falls within standards, take your dogs into the vet and have it tested for any genetic issues that may cause them to be unfit to breed. If your vet is qualified, have the dogs temperament tested also. Temperament is one of the most important attributes in a dog. If they fails any of these tests, do not breed them.<br>  <br>  Finally, make sure that you have at least $3000 saved incase you have any problems that may arise during the pregnancy or whelping. If you can’t afford that, stop and fix the dogs!<br>  <br>  Now for my lecture....Not all dogs should be breed. Breeding takes time, energy, and a lot of money. There are so many dogs in shelters or puppy mills now, that should never have been born or breed.  I really do not think that you should breed this pup, since you haven’t seemed to have done any research! That is extremely irresponsible and reckless.

Generally, the more the dog looks like a wolf, the more wolf he has in him. If he looks more like a husky, then he's probably mostly husky.<br>  <br>  As cool as it sounds to have a high percentage of wolf in your wolfdog hybrid, it's really not cool at all. <br>  <br>  You see, dogs are essentially wolves stuck in the puppy stage. Dogs act like juvenille wolves throughout their entire lives. <br>  If the percentage of wolf is high enough in the hybrid, then you wind up with a creature that is extremely difficult to train, very adept at getting out of your average fence, and really not a pet at all. Once the hybrid gets out of the puppy stage, he becomes a wolf, and you wind up being a caretaker instead of a dog owner. <br>  Wolves can get out of a six food fence faster than you can realize. They will kill your neighbor's pet cat and not even think twice. They've got no interest in training or listening to you, or sometimes, even being pet. They are beautiful to watch, but your neighbors won't think so when they howl all night.<br>  <br>  Owning a wolf hybrid is one of those things that sounds like a good idea in theory, but in practice, goes horribly wrong. <br>  <br>  Now, if your wolf hybrid has a low percentage of wolf in him, then he usually turns out to be just a particularly difficult husky, with less wolf behavior, and less wolf behavioral issues.<br>  <br>  The good thing is most wolf hybrid breeders overreport the amount of wolf actually present in their puppies, so most people only think they are getting a high percentage hybrid. There's no breed registration, so you really have to trust the person you are purchasing the puppy from. There may not even actually be any wolf in him (German Shepherd/Siberian Husky cross and a Wolf Hybrid look really similar).<br>  <br>  Check with the laws in your state, too. In many states, wolf hybrids are completely banned or heavily regulated. <br>  <br>  So in conclusion, don't get a wolf hybrid unless you are dedicated to providing a safe, escape proof habitat that keeps both your wolf hybrid in and your neighbor's dogs out. Be prepared for an animal that grows up to want little to do with humans, and know the laws in your area.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...|`|1ad26db7827a4a6d7ac91bcef2fda815aa	fantastic looking animals, be very aware if you are going to get one that both breeds are indipendent and dominant by nature, give them an inch and they will take a mile. But if you make it clear from the start who is boss and make the dog work for you, you can have an exceptional companion, that is also a stunning looking companion too. Firm but fair training is a must, and socialization with other dogs a people really important to keep some of the less desired natures in check. I have personaly found that food reward based training should be avoided, and to rely on praise for reward. Make sure you have an understanding of pack drive with these breeds and what an alpha dog would do to keep its pack happy. Being aware of this can also help if your dog getting a little wayward.......rather than scolding and punishing, repacking by you as the alpha is much more painless and easy to do without getting physical.

Training is required mainly because of over-aggression, chewing, barking (sometimes), digging, biting/nipping, separation anxiety, and fighting between dogs. Teaching the dog to behave properly is as important as well mannered people around him or her. Children should learn how to interact with dogs; avoid engaging dogs in improper and provocative play like roughhousing,and chase. Teasing, screaming and running wildly through the house are bound to unnerve even the most docile dog, leading to aggression. Instead, children should be instructed to leave the sleeping and eating dog alone. They should be taught games like ball play, hide and seek, and how to gently touch and pet the dog in a calming and sweet manner. Dogs must be taught as well.|`|eb4fbba4d475bd541d0088e11eb19f3eaa	I suggest NOT getting a wolf hybrid until you get to know the breed.

Other names applied to this condition include wooly coat, coat funk, pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome, and severe hair loss syndrome. <br>  <br>  In Pomeranians, this condition is suspected to be an X-linked inherited disorder since many more males than females are affected, and research is being carried out to identify a linked gene marker so that dogs in this breed can potentially be tested for the condition. Other breeds with increased prevalence of black skin disease include the Alaskan malamute, keeshond, poodle, dachshund, chow chow, Samoyed and American water spaniel. <br>  <br>  Many of the afflicted dogs are diagnosed with growth hormone responsive alopecia. Not all affected dogs have abnormal growth hormone levels though, and though many affected dogs develop abnormal signs after puberty, dogs of any age can be affected. In Pomeranians, late onset signs are sometimes associated with reduced 21-hydroxylase levels, enzymes which are involved with processing of some of the reproductive hormone precursors. <br>  <br>  Currently, the condition is still considered to be of unknown cause since similar signs of hair loss and black skin are not consistently associated with a standard set of hormone changes. Other conditions that can mimic this condition include Cushing’s disease, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and reproductive hormone disorders that should all be ruled out by testing. <br>  <br>  If the condition is due to a laboratory confirmed growth hormone deficiency, hormone therapy is instituted. Benefits last from six months to a few years.

It worked.|`|TBfyd0Deaa	My parents Cairn Terrier got this not so long ago. I went and bought a skin and coat supplement from WalMart that helped a lot-- it's almost gone after 3 weeks of taking it. The supplement is in a brown bottle and says Skin and Coat Supplement on the outside-- it's an oil, so it's kind of messy, but it's only about $2.50 for a nice size bottle.<br>  <br>  I also use Brewers Yeast tabs for my Cairn who is prone to dry skin. I give him 2 tabs a day and it cleared everything up too. The Brewers Yeast is also found at Wal-Mart (make sure you get the pet version as the mg per tab may vary if you get people meds) and comes with 250 tabs for $2.50 also. Brewers yeast also is a natural preventative for fleas, or so I have read. I still use flea medicine in the summer regardless.

If their mother is not properly vaccinated or the area they were born in is contaminated then yes they could get it. They are only protected by their mothers milk if she has been vaccinated. Parvo can stay in the environment for up to 6 months so if it is in the yard the mom could bring it in and the puppies could get it. Parvo is transmitted fecal orally which means they have to ingest contaminated feces to get it. Are the puppies having bloody diarrhea or vominting because those are the main signs of Parvo. I would definitely take them in. It could just be worms or something else but they should definitely see a vet ASAP! Puppies dont have good immune systems yet, so being sick for a long time is bad and it doesnt take much to really dehydrate a puppy. Good luck

But have you done absolutely no research? There are many different types of dogs that are considered "hypo-allergenic", but nothing is non-allergenic! And what doesn't bother one person's allergies, will affect someone else's allergies. Someone with asthma is going to have the hardest time finding a dog. I would not recommend buying one for her, she has to meet the pup and the pups parents to determine if she will have a problem with the puppy. All puppies are hypo-allergenic, because they have not developed the dander, skin oils, and bacteria in their saliva yet. <br>  <br>  Second, if any breeder is selling their puppies claiming that they are "hypo-allergenic" then you need to run away, and fast!|`|e4891efcb808213d898f07ad2c4ee8e2aa	The best deal you can get is by adopting a dog from an animal shelter.

Try looking on petfinder.com to find dogs in your area that are in need of homes. Or you can visit your local animal shelters, because not all animal shelters list their animals on petfiner.

Allow the dog to jump up to get the treat... Make sure you keep saying beg as you are doing this and as the dog takes the treat...<br>  <br>  5 - Give the dog lots of affection, more when the dog actually jumps up to get the treat... <br>  <br>  6 - After a few tries, the dog will get the hang of things and will learn that standing up on back legs to reach the treat = beg...|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	yes  there a books  on how to teach tricks to dog.    first  get the dog to sit  stay and then when it sits try taking a treat and holding it just over the head.     some dogs never learn how to sit up because they do not have the balance to do it  good luck|`|647e8a48ad9fe5f5763a7ce619d1e9ffaa	1# first get and treat.next put it in front of your dogs face .Then make the dog get up and try to eat it.|`|FvaNpPjfaa	put here paws on a table then put a treat up there then take her paws down and keep repeating it she should get the idea that when she puts her paws up she gets a treat then start doing it with a special word or gesture|`|bfIWs5RFaa	I would probably have the dog sit and hold a pc of food above his head.

They were used as circus dogs where they did tricks. It is not in there nature to bark a lot. If the puppy does bark just tell them no each time it barks unnecessarily and it will break the habit before adulthood. All dogs eyes stain, you just can't tell in darker dogs. They come in black,cream, gold, white, chocolate silver and blue. Your best bet for not having the stain is black and chocalate. There are products you can buy that will make the stain less visable.<br>  <br>  Male vs Female<br>  The male is usually an affectionate "slob".  He'll be more exuberant and more demanding of attention, never getting enough.  They also tend to be more steadfast and reliable and less moody.  No matter the age, he'll be more likely to act silly and puppy-like.  On the other hand he's more likely to try to dominate you, particularly during his first year or so.  He'll be more easily distracted during training.  The female is generally much more discriminating than the male.  She can be affectionate, but when she's had enough she'll move away.  She's usually quicker to learn and less distracted during training.  She is less likely to wage a dominance battle with you but can be cunning and resourceful in getting her own way.  She is much more prone to mood swings than the male.  One day she may be sweet and affectionate - the next day reserved and withdrawn or even grumpy.

The type I'm thinking of are use for travel...are mostly plastic, have wire doors and windows. You can lock them. They are easy to clean and you can move the birds inside to a garage when the temps take a dive.<br>  <br>  or:<br>  <br>  How to build a <br>  Chicken Coop  <br>  <br>   Introduction - Materials list <br>  Use the following plans and information as a guide only.  <br>  <br>  These plans and information are for the most part general and should you choose to use them, it would be advisable to do a bit of your own research. Where necessary you may need to make changes to suit the local environment. The best type of information and knowledge available is local knowledge. Check with your local council to see what may or may not be required from their point of view, including any animal welfare obligations. <br>  <br>  A chicken coop is a place of shelter, a safe retreat for chickens and a place where the hens can lay their eggs. A chicken coop is accompanied by a run, which is the chickens' outside area. The scope of the run can vary greatly depending on local conditions, the type of predator (wild or domestic) that might be lurking around seeking a free chicken meal and anything else that could be a threat to the well-being of the chicken. These factors will also determine whether the chicken can be free-ranging or confined to a fenced or fully enclosed type of holding pen. <br>  <br>  This chicken coop should comfortably house at least eight chickens and generously allows for: <br>   4.5 sq ft of space per chicken <br>   3 nests shared between 8 chickens <br>   9" of perch length for each chicken <br>  <br>  The design also allows for: <br>  a bit of a storage area, chicken hatchway (i.e. entrance hole), ample ventilation, ample light and a door that opens inwards and is big enough to enable easy access and cleaning of the chicken coop. <br>  <br>  The floor is designed to take "deep litter" which is at least a (3") covering of wood shavings or similar. <br>  <br>  NOTE: There is no design or allowance for any feeder system, water container or supply system. Although some people make their own, most people find it easier to purchase a feeder system /water container from the appropriate store. <br>  <br>  Materials list <br>  Excludes hardware and any feeder or water supply materials.  <br>  <br>  Stock Size/ Material  Used For  Amount  <br>  4x4 Suitable for exterior use  Skids  2 pieces at 72"  <br>  2x4 Suitable for exterior use  Floor Joists and boundary joists  36 lineal ft  <br>  4x4  Corner studs  4 pieces at 72"  <br>  2x4  All framing walls and roof  150 lineal ft  <br>  2x3  Perch and perch support  8 lineal ft  <br>  2x2  Nesting perch  40"  <br>  4'x8' plywood sheets 3/4" thick suitable for exterior use  Flooring, wall cladding and parts of nesting boxes  7 sheets  <br>  1x4 suitable for exterior use  Cladding battens, door stop and part of nesting boxes  120 lineal ft  <br>  1x12 suitable for exterior use  Part of nesting boxes  9 lineal ft  <br>  1x6 suitable for exterior use  Roofing boards and litter board  200 lineal ft  <br>  Tar paper, breather type building paper or similar roofing underlay.

It takes longer, but sometimes, it's more reliable.

Also they don't work for all types of worms.<br>  <br>  You should NOT indiscriminantly deworm your dog.

kgwpvJMoaa	First, I don't condone casual breeding of hamsters.  To be a responsible breeder, you need to do a bit of research first.  The first stop would be the Internet Hamster Assocation of North America.  A responsible breeder will be a member and uphold the Breeder's Code:<br>  <a href="http://groups.msn.com/InternetHamsterAssoc" rel="nofollow">http://groups.msn.com/InternetHamsterAss...</a><br>  <br>  Secondly, you should read some excellent articles written by some of the top hamster breeders in the US and posted on the California Hamster Association website:<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/calhamassoc/BeforeBreed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/calhamassoc/Bef...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/calhamassoc/BreedingEthics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/calhamassoc/Bre...</a><br>  <br>  Next, you need to know the age of your female.  Breeding her at the wrong age will cause her harm.  A hamster should not be bred until she is between 4-6 months of age. Breeding her any younger and it will have a negative effect on her. The pups and pregnancy will drain needed energy and vitamins from her since she is still growing herself and without them she will never achieve the full size she would have if she hadn't had a litter so early.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, waiting longer than 6 months to breed a female has its consequences too. At 6 months the female hamsters hip and pelvic bones fuse. If she's already had a litter, then everything will be fine. If she hasn't had a litter, then the bones will fuse too narrow for pups to be safely delivered. If the female somehow does manage to deliver the litter, most, if not all, will be dead from the trauma of being forced through a bone structure that's too small.  What usually happens though, is that the pups can't be delivered and will die inside her.  An infection will set in and the female hamster will die slowly as the infection spreads throughout her body.  Antibiotics will not cure the infection as the babies will still be inside, though they will help the symptoms of infection.  The only way to save the female at this point is to be spayed, though you will be hard pressed to find a vet that will do this procedure.<br>  <br>  If you realize all of this and still want to mate, then you need to put the female into the males cage each night and watch them.  A female will go into heat every 4-5 days.  Going "in heat" correlates with ovulation.  A female will show signs of being in heat several hours before she ovulates.  If she is in heat, she will take the "freeze" position when the male approaches her.  In the freeze position she will lower her body and raise her tail and hind in the air to allow for a better mount.  If she is not in heat then she will quickly attack the male and you need to get her out of there before she injures him.<br>  <br>  You may find that 4-5 days go by and you've tried her each day and she has not gone into heat.  This is a problem that many breeders face.  Due to the shortened days and decreased temperatures, female Syrians will not go into heat.  Breeders circumvent this by adding at least 14 hours of artificial lighting and heating the room the hamsters are in to around 74 degrees.  Once the lights go on the hamsters, you must wait at least 2 hours before trying to breed the female.  She may show that she is in heat prior to that, but she will not be close to ovulating and thus the breeding will be unsuccessful.  There are nights that I am breeding hamsters until 2 o'clock in the morning.  The earliest I even consider trying to breed the hamsters is 11pm.<br>  <br>  -Janice<br>  <a href="http://www.holmdenhillhaven.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.holmdenhillhaven.com</a>|`|BoT5zWhtaa	She will know, you won't.|`|AA10816466	it probably goes in heat

AA12398420	Swelling is one sign. But it looks as though you are not a very responsible pet owner if you keep your poor dog on a chain.<br>  It is very uncomfortable for them to be in heat and there are enough dogs dying to get a home.

I'd also sort some secure fencing out and a kennel so you don't have to keep her chained up and she's got shelter if she wants it.|`|d19278fc2ae0a6a14f0f7ae6b2d3b0ffaa	ALL  GOOD INFORMATION, BUT YOU CAN TELL IF SHE IS COMING INTO HEAT BY SWELLING.

Buy lots of them and many different types. (it may sound expensive but better that than your new shoes or furniture) If she bites any human, tell her firmly no and immediately put something sanctioned in her mouth. She is teething so she really want to chew stuff to ease the pain.<br>  <br>  Once she learns what's appropriate to chew and what's not, the rest will work itself out as she gets older and stops teething.<br>  <br>  I used a canvas stuffed bone that you put in the freezer and it really helped.

Also  stuffed toys (just watch the stuffing) are good, greenies or Nylabones too!<br>  <br>  As for the older dog, you may want to control the environment when both dogs are in the same room.

Of course - don't let her eat the cat food becaues from what I've heard it's not good for dogs. <br>  <br>  Our trainer told us to not worry about her not eating the dog food for a little bit (like one or two days max) because she'll eventually realize that she won't get the cat food and get hungry enough to eat her own food. <br>  <br>  It worked like a charm, and now we leave the cat food out and she won't touch it.

Kibble has been around for some 80 years, and dogs certainly do not know how to differentiate between little pellets of "dog formula processed stuff" and "cat formula processed stuff".  You could potentially train the dog to leave the cat's bowl alone, but especially if this is an ingrained habit, imuch, much easier would be to put up a baby gate and leave it high enough off the floor that your cat can get underneath but your dog can not, or to create some other sort of little gate or crate set-up that just the cat can get into.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	Why does she need to?

fd084ea5251793e8be9788692c598ce0aa	I hate to state the obvious, but what has your vet said about this "swelling"?  Is it the equivalent of a "corn" or something more severe?  Soaking may relieve some pain, but I don't think it will eliminate the problem.  It could be an odd fatty deposit or a cancerous growth or a sting from an insect, an infection from something he stepped in, a piece of glass, etc.  Please let us know what the vet says this is.|`|709c6903bb9d12e5785ce1c84dd91533aa	It could be a cancer lump, you should have your vet check his paw and make sure he is ok.

So, to be on the safe side, consult an animal doctor, he or she will advise you in what it is and what kind of treatment your dog will need. Sorry I couldn't be of more help to you. I hope your dog is feeling better soon.
Gdrt18TPaa	When our dog was in heat, we bought regular children's diapers and cut a hole in them for the tail. It seemed to work very well for us. <br>  <br>  There is a little powder that comes out of the hole, so it depends on whether it will irritate your dog or not.

eriPTAOKaa	A Tie is a natural phenomenon of dog breeding in which the bulbus glandis of the male's penis swells inside the *****'s vagina. The dogs are virtually licked together for 15-20 minutes, during which time ejaculation takes place. <br>  <br>  A male dog actually ejaculates three times during the mating procedure. The first is during the initial part of the mating, is fairly brief, and consists of a fluid which is called the "presperm" fraction and just prepares and lubricates the female's reproductive system. The second fraction is the one that contains the sperm and is quite a small quantity of fluid. This is produced during the time when the dog is thrusting vigourously and BEFORE he turns. <br>  <br>  Once the dog has turned then the third fraction is produced. This is a large quantity of clear fluid produced by the prostate. This has the function of "washing" the semen down into the uterus and makes sure that the sperm get as near to the area where they can be most effective as possible.|`|AA11976328	mayb its bcoz they really are very attached to da owner....maybe they really want to live long enough to be with the owner always....all MAYBEs....|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	i just depends on the male dog.   there is no set  time for the amount of time they are tied.|`|47004d6023833c5777866194b66ed33daa	The dogs can not separate until the males penis relaxes. Sometimes due to excitement or the inability to relax because of things going on around them this takes longer.
gkHNcZbbaa	Depends.  In the wild they wouldn't cry - unless they'd lost their pack/mother/siblings, or were injured.  Domestic dogs cry for the same reasons - is your dog a pup who has been taken from his littermates recently? is he lonely?  Is he scared?  Does he need the toilet?  Is he hungry?  My pup cried when we brought her home, so we kept her in our room for 2 nights (NOT on the bed!) then put her in a crate downstairs with a t-shirt of ours, a hot water bottle and a ticking clock.  It worked like magic.  She's 6 months now and sleeps through the night!|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	does the dogs sleep in crates or are they left outside?|`|a3f2457aa73bf77b6ff5d8dbfbc3dbefaa	They are bored, lonely and scared.  If you let them sleep in your room/bed they will probably settle (or chew up your blankets)|`|3UIdQBsUaa	Is this a particular dog? If so what are the conditions?  We had a dog that slept in her crate at first while she was being housebroken and she was not impressed about being seperated from the rest of us.  Once we put the crate in the bedroom she was fine and slept through the night.  If the dog hasn't had enough exercise he/she could be bored and is vocalizing frustration with being crated or just with the people in the house not being there to pay attention.  In this case its important to address because the next stage of this behavior would be for the dog to start being destructive toward your "things" like chewing up furniture, etc. Those are probably the 2 most common.  I have heard of others who's dogs have had real problems, once had eaten a rock (dogs will eat anything) and was trying to pass the rock, when the dog would lay down for the night to sleep the rock would cause a great deal of pain so the dog would cry.  Along that same line there could be ANYTHING that causes the dog to be uncomfortable or in pain that would cause whining/crying.  Does the dog have a comfortable place to sleep or is he/she on the floor or hard floor of a crate?  Is it cold where the pup is sleeping?  If so a nice blanket to keep warm would be in order|`|47004d6023833c5777866194b66ed33daa	They are pack animals and do not like to be separated. A dog will not only howl when it is lonely but, will also howl for reassurance the pack members are near. Some dogs will stop but, others may not.
a60719bf3d87870f841467742b1e5a83aa	I used to be a dog groomer, so maybe I can help steer you in the right direction. The brand of clipper that I prefer is Oster. There are many brands that make a do-it-yourself home kit, but personally I think they make those just to frustrate you into going to the groomers. Do not waste you money on any new clipper under $100, and yes, unfortunately, true pro clippers do cost around $200+. The clipper traditionally came with 1 blade, but that may have changed since my pro days. Depending on the "size" of the blade, they do cost around $50 each, and you really do want more than one blade even if you use only one size. The reason for that is that the blades get hot as you use them and you do not want to burn your baby with a hot blade. Yes, they _can_ get hot enough to cause a bad burn. The blades get hot not only due to their own friction but because the motor of the clipper gets hot and the heat is transmitted to the blade. Having a spare blade or 2 to switch to makes it so you do not have to stop and wait for the blade to cool down enough to continue clipping. Optimally, you would have 2 clippers and a minimum of 2 of each size blade that you use. Then there are the products needed to maintain your clipper and blades.<br>  <br>  What might be your best bet is to find out if there are any grooming schools where you live. Back when I trained it was a small privately run school, and not all that expensive when compared to other trade schools. The course wasn't very long either, a couple - 3 months if I remember correctly. A school will show you how to handle a dog that is not thrilled with the whole situation, and to do it without hurting the dog. They usually have an arrangement with a supplier to provide the students with the needed supplies, usually at a discounted rate even if only a small discount.

Dog lovers will tell you that following the passing of a beloved pet that they truly are not able to immediately transfer their affection to another pet. The human heart just doesn;t work that way. Your father needs time to work through the grieving proceess and to accept and face the loss of his beloved companion. You have to remember that some men are more close to their dogs than they are to the rest of the family because they find that the dog can give them unconditional love, support, and is able to respond their masters emotional needs.  It is not just a dog, it is a best friend that he is having to watch die.  Now think of it that way....see how tough it is for him?<br>    Chances are, if and when he feels that he can open his heart to accepting another pet, it will be his decision. The best thing you can do is to respect the way he is coping with the pet's dying and to understand that this is probably emotionally heartbreaking on him.|`|60e41e781e4fe0684fa8ca97041a0efeaa	oh  that   so sad  but your sister is write God give us to many year and dogs so few year because there many dogs need love and care of us please adopt another dog he need all love that you guys have|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	please ask him if he ready for another dog before you get him one. please do not get him one for a surpise.     when you decide to get him what he likes.   like the lab.

Xcjf8M3Yaa	While most dogs will run after an object when you throw it, this  isn't "fetching". Fetching means the dog bring an object back to you on command and then gives it up to you. In order to teach this properly, your dog should know how to "sit" and "come" first.<br>  <br>  Have your dog on a leach and tell it to "sit" before you start. Next, place the toy on the ground a short distance away.<br>  <br>  You must keep your dog in the sitting position until you're ready for her to retrieve the object. This means you might have to hold onto your dog's collar if it keeps trying to get up and her the toy.<br>  <br>  When you're ready, let go of your dog's collar and say "Fetch". She might go to the object right away and grab it with her mouth. If not, you have to take her over to the object. You might even have to pick up the toy yourself and give it to her.<br>  <br>  Next, command your dog to come if she walked to her object by herself. If you had to bring her to the object yourself, bring her back to the place where you started.<br>  <br>  Give your dog the "sit" command again and then say "drop it". You might have to show her a treat in order to get her to give up the toy. Either way, give her lots of praise!<br>  <br>  You can increase the distance that you place the object.

AA11507042	If I were a dog, and I heard someone sneeze, I might think it was another dog "woofing" to play or at something interesting.<br>  <br>  Dogs have their own language and a sneeze to this dog may trigger something in him, linguistically speaking, that he may recognize.  Try whining at your dog.  Most dogs will raise their ears and lean their heads as to say "is there something wrong".   Different words in the english language can trigger different reactions by accident, or even on purpose.  I think the word "treat" is universally recognized, and may be evolutionally bred, by dogs around the english speaking world.  My dogs go crazy when they hear the word "treat", but that has been taught.    <br>  <br>  I have 3 hunting dogs, and they know when I get my hunting boots out of the closet, they see a gun pulled out, or the tailgate of my pickup is opened, there is a chance we may be going hunting.  So they bark, jump up and down and act really excited when they even "see" this event beginning to take place.<br>  <br>  I work with Wisconsin German Shorthaired Pointer Rescue and one of the things we do with dogs is the name game.  If we get a dog from a shelter that has been a stray, generally the shelter names the dog, probably something different than the original name.  We will sit there with the dog, and start saying names until the dog gives us a reaction, just like your sneeze.  So we will rename the dog if we get a positive reaction.<br>  <br>  I have a good time just having conversations with my dogs.  Sometimes they pay attention to what I am talking about, but mostly they look bored.  Maybe it is just me.  <br>  <br>  If you want to change the behavior, when he comes running, ignore him.  He will get the picture eventually that nothing is happening when he hears a sneeze and he can go along with his business.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and enjoy your dog.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	my rescue sheltie run away and then come right back to check on the person that sneezed.|`|7apTt06Zaa	WELL I WILL TECH YOU A LITTLE SOMTHING I LIKE TO CALL ED NOT DOING  WHEN   YOU DON'T HAVE ALLERGYS AND MAYBE HE WILL STOP|`|bf1ac664119a21166bbfafd870bd2f7aaa	My dog does exactly the same thing, i think she thinks we are calling her.

krXQaZAfaa	Hi there, I am a Veterinarian Technition and hope I can help answer your question.  Lymphoma is when lymphocytes (the primary cells of the lymph system) become cancerous within a lymph node, the node swells and hardens. Malignant lymphocytes readily travel through the lymph vessels to nearby lymph nodes. Soon all the nodes are enlarged.  Ultimately, the bone marrow (where most blood cells are formed) is affected, the immune system is destroyed, and severe anemia and weakness usually claim a canines life.  Basically, Lymphoma is cancer.  You should bring your dog to the vet to verify what stage of Lymphoma he is in.  Here are the five different stages of Lymphoma: FIRST: only one lymph node involved; SECOND: several lymph nodes in the same general area involved; THIRD: all peripheral lymph nodes involved; FOURTH: all peripheral lymph nodes plus the spleen, liver, and/or anterior mediastinum in the chest involved; and FIFTH: bone marrow involvement, regardless of any other areas involved.  Depending on the stage of your dogs Lymphoma will depend on any treatment options, if any.  Usually if your dog is in stage one or stage two the tumors (infected lymph nodes) can be removed before the cancer spreads.  Chemo is also a good option, an expensive option, but a good option at those two stages.  Obviously, the higher stages, the harder to treat, just like human cancer.  Lymphoma a rapidly growing cancer that is able to go and grow anywhere where there is lymph tissue. This is virtually every organ in the body.  Eventually, the cancer will infiltrate an organ to such an extent that that organ fails (often this is the bone marrow or the liver).  The patient loses his/her appetite, vomits or gets diarrhea, and weakens, usually vets will urge you to humanely euthanize before your dog suffers.  I know everything I just told you can be overwhelming, but I wanted to be honest, so you know what to expect.  Hope this helps!|`|LPEO6AsCaa	It is cancer so I would probably think it is not.  You can probably have the tumor removed but I think it would most likely not solve the problem.  As soon as you get the dog take him into your vets for a complete check up and ask your vet what all the options are.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	you need to ask a vet in your area about it.

9nFSMMiXaa	Confine the cat to one room with everything he needs and spend time just sitting in the room with him.  Stroke him while he eats and talk to him so he gets used to your voice.  Only allow access to the rest of you home when he feels safe with you in one room.  Remember that you are some kind of stranger, it takes time to become family with a grown adopted cat.  Personally I only ever adopt adult cats, there is more of a challenge to train and fit them into the household and the rewards of success are endless.<br>  Cheers, Shona<br>  I have three cats at this time in my life.|`|KpUhk6nJaa	Cats are very independant he/she will soon come to you when they're ready to be pampered.|`|XXFUPHsVaa	sweetie you need to let her come to you when she feels safe it will take time as alot of animal shelters house cats and dogs next door to each other and the mere sound of something strange can trigger stress in cats so be patient with him|`|ZeAXVyULaa	I advise you hold your cat every day for like an hour. first catch the cat and sit on the couch, then you can watch t.v. or just talk to her, give her treats once in awhile, and try to play with her often. even if your cat doesn't want to see you, you can drag a mouse on the floor for her. =3<br>  <br>  Good  Luck|`|lpQ279Braa	You may have done something like leaving her alone too much or accidently stepping on her. Don't try to push anything. You have to rebuild the trust. Kneel down on the floor and hold your hand out to her. Call her. When she comes over, don't make any sudden movements. Let her sniff you. When she seems satisfied, then you can pet her. Mainly, she needs to come to you. This works with dogs as well.|`|AA10791101	Most likely it is something you have done.  Some times it is not easy to know just what it is.  <br>  <br>  One of my cats does not like that mean woman that lives in this house.

Had a cat hated being touched.  He was born on my place, so I know he was never harmed. Just did not like people touching him.  Then we had a lightning storm that went on for hours.  I was in a rocking chair watching,from a safe distance.  Suddenly thump, this cat landed in my lap.  he stayed there til the storm was done.  From then on he let us pet him.  Cats are very independent critters.|`|AA12260782	Have you ever heard the term "Feral Cat"?<br>  It's when pet cats are born and raised outdoors and don't have contact with people before they are a few weeks old.  No early contact means they don't learn that humans are friends.  <br>  They are rescued be well-meaning people who take them to shelters.<br>  These cats are then billed as "shy" or "slow to warm up".  Really they're sort of in shock.  Shelters are not comfortable places and these cats sort of freeze up and allow themselves to be handled, which is mistaken for friendliness.<br>  Once you get them home an comfortable, they revert to their true wild selves.<br>  Things to try:<br>  ~Bribe her with food.  Sometimes they can be re-habilitated and make wonderful pets.  Teach her that you make a great friend.  All things good and yummy come from you from now on.  Only kibble in her dish.<br>  ~Don't force contact.  Let her come to you.<br>  <br>  I have to tell you that these cats rarely come around.  Especially older cats.  Any thing is possible though.  I have heard several stories where people get these cats, let them out of the carriers and never see them again.  A neighbor of mine has a cat living behind her sofa that she never sees.  It eats and uses the litter box at night when she goes to bed.  She's had that cat for 15 YEARS!!!<br>  Same story for a man that brought his cat to the vet clinic where I worked.  His lived under the bed for 9 years.<br>  <br>  It might be better to "cat proof" your yard, get a dog house and let her be an outdoor cat.  She will be more comfortable and happy, and you won't be injured.<br>  <br>  Take the cat back to the shelter.  It seems heartless, but you deserve a good pet and this isn't one.  <br>  Notify the shelter of whats happening.  Sometimes shelter workers will pass off a feral cat as friendly because they don't want it euthanized.  This is wrong.  They need to know you're having problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kXaLbjNKaa	Are you leaving the cat alone for long periods of time?  Sometimes they are just loners...try bribing it with some cat treats everytime you come home.

Some antihistamines would help with that, like Benadryl.<br>  <br>  My first thought however is a tooth root abcess. If you lift her/his lip and look at the teeth are they shiny and white with no chip, breaks, or cracks? Or are they covered in tartar with a red gum line? Usually an abcess, or pus pocket, will form as a lump under the eye due to a bad upper tooth on that same side. Usually the largest premolar, the carnassial.<br>  <br>  A warm compress on that area may help. If the swelling doesn't resolve in a day I would take her to your regular veterinarian.|`|eipDfitCaa	i'd go to a vet soon, in case it is something serious that it could lose an eye

DON'T wait,, it is easier when they are younger.....
655e207d8e6798c43fcd255cdb8b49d0aa	Depending on the breed of dog there might be no training needed.  I thought my german shepherds were all wimps, but I had someone come up behind me one evening and touch my shoulder.  Scared me and I yelled and my shepherds looked anything but wimpy.  The male had the whole cujo thing going on with drool and teeth showing, lips back.  He wasn't barking either, just came around the corner of the house with a low growl.  The female thought that took too much time and went right for the guy, barking the whole time and she sailed through the air and her feet hit him in the chest.  I never did find out what he wanted he took off, we live out of the way and there aren't many houses around, so he didn't belong, but I don't know that he wasn't broke down or something.  Only the female attempted to chase, but she came back when I called.  On the other hand, my daughter and I or my roommate can act like we are fighting and the dogs start playing with each other and you can't make them attack .  They did however pick up on the fear or maybe sensed something else that one night.  Since then it's happened with my male two other times, when we were traveling I stopped to get gas and he wouldn't let some people walk up to the truck - that wasn't me because I didn't even know they were coming to the truck, he jumped out of the window and came around to stand by me though, and wouldn't let anyone get near.  Really think before you train a dog to attack, some dogs might already sense when they need to be aggressive.  I think had they had any more training people may have been hurt instead of just warned off.|`|4q5MxAgbaa	You cannot do it yourself.  You must find a reputable trainer in your area specializing in protection training.  It can be very dangerous to both you and the dog if you try to do this yourself and don't succeed.

There are many books and classes you can take. Considering youre asking this question online I'm assuming you've never researched how to care for a dog much less train him to attack.... CONGRATS on adding to the already growing list of MORONS who wonder why their dog attacked someone for no reason!|`|atzw0IP4aa	I guess I would try to find a trainer that can help you. There are bite schools if you want to do it the right way with out tramatizing your dog or having anyone get hurt. The police dept might have a trainer for their k9's Look online.  PLEASE seek out a trainer. <br>  <br>  I tell my dogs "make friends" with the people that are cleared by me , and "who's here"  fro her to be on alert. I will let her bark and then when I can get to her outside I make her sit if it's ok. Other wise they read you and would not stop barking. <br>  <br>  Please seek a trainer as you want to be the pack leader and not have anyone get hurt by accident if you can not control the dog, they would remove the dog and euthanize. So please think wisely. It would be a tragedy if an inicent child or adult or another animal got hurt by your ignorance.<br>  <br>  It is also the dogs temperment. if you have a soft temperment, they will be a great pet and not have that drive. I understand wanting the protection and sometimes having a dog with you is enough. Ist off they are a companion and pet and part of your family.|`|xZeuHcjZaa	You should not teach a dog to do that!!!!!! If you want to have someone attacked you do it and get your _ _ _ kicked.

Only dogs in service of the military or law enforcement should be trained for this behavior. If you still feel that you need yourdog to be a protector start with the basics and obedience train your pet so that you will have an animal that is responsive to commands. You can buy videos and books on your breed and how to train them at your local pet supply store. Good luck and I hope you end up with a very well mannered protector.|`|b3e89bb25aaa43114ed957406f62fb51aa	It will cost you a minimum of a couple of thousand dollars. You have to go through 3 courses of shutzin training. This can only be done by professional trainers.  Keep in mind that your dog will be hit & beaten to make him more aggressive. He will lose his personality & playfulness & be stone cold.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that he won't be your dog anymore. He will be a living machine trained to do only one thing.<br>  Also, the first time you sick him on someone.

OGhVQ9Ojaa	Of course it would do harm to it if you give it cat food. The ingredients in cat food and dog food and totally different. Both food are made after much analyse on the animal. Giving the dog cat food would cause them to have stomachache. If your dog has small teeth, you can grind the dry food into smaller pieces for it, or cut the can food into smaller piece, but NEVER give it cat food to it. It is counted as pets abuse in some countries, it could end up losing a LIFE! :)|`|4DcU5krdaa	Hi,<br>  You didn`t say how old your dog is.<br>  Sometimes I will use cat food in very small bits to help train a certain exercise, but no don`t feed you dog cat food regularly.<br>  If you are feeding kibble make it moist by adding water or a beef or chicken broth.<br>  I can understand that this can now be a problem for a lot of pet owners with the recall of so many canned or pouched dog foods.<br>  Floren DeWaard<br>  Wiley Creek Kennels|`|e41a4d80df8e5a9e6f0d182f3531b31caa	It would cause intestinal problems (like diarrhea and vomiting), and since it is not balanced for dogs it would eventually reek havoc on the dog's entire system.

9nFSMMiXaa	Shetland sheep dogs are smarter and probably more robust, Maltese dogs are very easily lost, they frequently wind up at shelters and dog pounds after a child has left a gate open.  A shetland will be more inclined to stay with the children or in the yard if the gate is open.<br>  Having said all that, Maltese are very sweet and make wonderful pets for older people with a properly enclosed yard.  I have only ever found one lost sheltie though and I have picked up more than a dozen maltese in my time, wandering lost along the road and sometimes on it.  Maltese are lovely and I talked my niece into adopting two eight year old boys when they needed a new home.  They are just not the brainiest of dogs, they're a diamond short of a necklace, sparkly and beautiful but you can see that something is missing.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	shelties are the best i have had 6 of them over the years.  but you have to make sure that they are well  socialized or they can be quite afraid of things  they need obedience  and agility training.  just make sudre that you get the puppy from a  good breeder of shelties..    you can e-mail me|`|20490665d5893b995dabc8048d39fb4faa	They both are great with kids.|`|0134264a66d9981e602519c54661e796aa	Maltese not good with kids that are young<br>  <br>  www.eurobichons.com|`|88bbf035694e0d3f071e611312050cebaa	There are pro's and con's of both breeds, so I would suggest that you go to the library and get a good book on dog breeds and do your research  <br>  Make a list for both breeds regarding positive and negative attributes and see what happens.<br>  <br>  From my point of view ( I managed a kennel in the past), the Maltese is a rather fragile dog , so it needs to be watched carefully around very young children.  Adults need to be watchful as the little dog tends to be under foot and can easily be tripped over or stepped on.  A very busy household might not be the safest place for this breed to be.<br>  The coat of the Maltese is like cotton candy and requires daily grooming to keep mats from forming.  If you want the dog to have a short coat, then frequent trips to the grooming salon is necessary ( find out what the cost is in your area) . If the line that the dog comes from has rather prominent eyes, then ,you will need to be watchful for eye injuries<br>  .<br>  The Sheltie is a rather hardy breed that  is very watchful with children.  It ,too, should be brushed daily.  By doing so, you will have gone a long way in keeping fluffs of hair from gathering  in the house. <br>  <br>  These are just a few of my observations!<br>  <br>  Good luck in your research.|`|debd9c746580dbc944784f9038b27ce7aa	Shetland Sheepdog is much better than a Maltese, especially when kids are involves. Maltese are way too small for children to handle. Kids can't help being clumsy and they will drop the poor little dog. I have a 12 year old cousin who once dropped my uncle's little Australian Silky. He broke his front leg and had to have surgery. It's not right to let a little dog live in a household with children who will poke, drop and tease him. A Sheltie is much more tolerant and is EXCELLENT with children.|`|AA11742786	maltese

8f51fd6f808ebfa83012c2642a39a00baa	I think, that when you are in a hurry to get dinner for a few friends, KFC isn't a bad choice.  The chicken is fattening, but if you don't eat it every single day, then you don't have to much to worry about.  <br>  <br>  The store in our local town is always clean, and the employee's are always polite.  The best way to tell if you should eat at a restaurant is by checking the bathrooms.  If they are dirty, RUN!!! <br>  <br>  As for KFC being cruel, I think you are referring to the way that the companies they buy their chicken from treats them.  KFC themselves are not cruel.  They are not the ones that are killing the chickens.  They purchase already slaughtered chickens.  Yes, they support the killing of the chickens.  but what more do you expect from a place called Kentucky Fried "Chicken".  I don't think it would work with anything else.

They don't really mind whether you have a yard or not as they are pretty active inside but that doesn't mean he doesn't need, want or like exercise.<br>  ~ They're pretty easy to maintain. If you mean grooming requirement, they need a brush down every few days with a firm bristle brush to get rid of the dead hairs. If you don't know how often to bathe a dog, you will now. 2-4 TIMES PER YEAR ONLY. Despite what other people say, bathing a dog every month is TERRIBLE for their skin and coat. They don't need baths to keep them smelling good.<br>  ~ Yes they shed their coat twice per year. They are NOT good dogs if you suffer from allergies. Remember that ALL dogs shed so don't get fooled by people selling dogs that "don't shed" at all.<br>  ~ They love their exercise but are not too demanding when it comes to exercising. A 30 minute walk each day will be plenty for this active little dog.<br>  ~ You really can't tell how high a medical bill will be! Just like all dogs, they have accidents which may require a surgery which costs $3,000. You already own a dog so I am sure you already know that vet bills can get pretty high if the dog comes down with something (requiring medication).<br>  ~ They have their fair share of health problems! They are prone to becoming overweight (obese) so you can't feed him too much. They are prone to back problems, PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy) and glaucoma. PRA is a hereditary diseases which affects the eyes and causes blindness. One more reason why only to buy from a reputable breeder!<br>  <br>  Also, just for future reference, the breed is Pembroke Welsh Corgi, not Penbrooke Corgi.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tn17Ndyvaa	EVERY newbie ALWAYS asks ...*&* the answer ALWAYS is=ALL DOGS SHED! <br>  ALL ANIMALS SHED! <br>  *YOU* SHED!<br>  Duh........<br>  <br>  Corgis shed PROFUSELY!(look at their DOUBLE COAT)<br>  <br>  Go READ the BREED STANDARD!|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	the name is Pembroke.   yes.          after potty and obedience training.         they shed.       they are a herding dog so they need something to do. so a fair amount of exercise.          the last two question you need to  check with the breeder you will be getting the  pippy from.

Fourteen for a dog is like being 90+ for a human.|`|AObH48dGaa	She is up there in years, and is probably slowing down due to her age. BUT..you said she "looks uncomfortable"? That is NOT good. Take her to the Vet, and find out what's making her uncomfortable. It could be something serious that is making her tired. Better safe than sorry..|`|a3810d156169b7ddc900b950f188e616aa	let your dog sleep, she is old,  and has earned that right,.....|`|sRVI44jeaa	Old dogs do like to sleep the day away, but if this is not what she normally does then I would take her to the vets for a check up.  What do you mean by uncomfortable? If she looks like she is in pain get her to the vet asap. Is she still eating and drinking ok.
hIrBZS3oaa	No one on this site can tell you what it is without looking at her.  Only a vet will know for sure.  It could be something very minor like a fatty tissue deposit, or it could be something very serious like a tumour.|`|0xJZJggVaa	Please get her in to a Vet ASAP. It might be nothing major, but she really needs to get it treated.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	please take the dog to your vet as soon as you can.   it could be several different things.|`|f464a569517bd592a904db90e83e43c0aa	Make an appointment today with your vet.  It's very important to have her checked out as soon as possible.  Good luck and let us know how she's doing.|`|s82rF82uaa	When dogs get old they tend to get lumps certain breeds more prominent but, they could be lymph's, or fibro tumors which are rarely anything. But, did you just find them and what breed or mixed breeds are we talking.. Cocker and terriers tend to have skin problems.  They pop out all over. Some cancerous most aren't better take your baby to the vet.  Where they are located is what concerns me.  Good Luck
3sB49YNnaa	It sounds like she is pregnant.  DO NOT, I repeat, do not take her to the vet unless you have an emergency.  Transporting pregnant guinea pigs is very stressful.  Stress is a major trigger for pregnancy toxemia.  Pregnancy toxemia is a major cause of death in pregnant sows.  So what little benefit you might get from a vet visit at this point is more than offset by the risk of toxemia.<br>  <br>  The pear or banjo shape is pretty predictive of pregnancy.  Put your hands gently on her sides and feel for pups inside her.  You will feel them up to a month before she has them and you will feel movement starting  a week or two before delivery.<br>  <br>  If she is used to living with other females and is bonded, she can and should stay with them.  I am assuming that you are sure that the others in the pen are females.  Any boars should be removed before she delivers, not because of anything they might do to the pups (they won't) but because they will re-breed the females within hours of delivery.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pig's delivery.|`|AA10196640	It is almost impossible to tell if she will be pregnant or not at first and as she is new you will not be familiar with any change in her behavior or routine. The only way i can advise is by playing the waiting game, guinea pig pregnancy last for 10 wk (give or take a few days). <br>  1. So mark on a calendar the day that your pigs where put together and calculate the ten week.<br>  2. Pregnant females take on a VERY noticeable pear shaped appearance as the babies grow.<br>  3. Weigh her weekly to see if she is putting on alot of weight and record the weight.<br>  4. About 6wk into the pregnancy if you gently take her and place her on a cushion on your lap with your hands under her sides then you should be able to feel the movement of the babies.<br>  5. The only sure way is to visit a vet they may charge a fee or if you have a experienced breeder close by then i am sure they would be more than happy to check to see if they can tell and will give very good advice if she is. <br>  <br>  <br>  Guinea pigs are ready to be sexually active when they are 4 weeks old so determine sex and place the girls with their mother and the boys with their father around 3 weeks old. (to determin sex go here: <a href="http://www.cavyspirit.com/sexing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavyspirit.com/sexing.htm</a> )<br>  <br>  Good luck!! Am praying for you and the piggy!|`|lenqvpWKaa	Sounds like it. You should definatly take her to the vet very soon to see if she is defitatly pregnant, if she is, ask if the other guinea pig will be ok with the new babies and make sure you get all the info.<br>  <br>  Because if she isnt pregnant she could have some kind of tumours or something so you better get her checked as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  (Good luck with the little ones if she is pregnant.)|`|VkXQq2y2aa	It does sound like your piggy is pregnant. <br>  i think the other piggy will be okay, but after she has her babies she might become defensive towards the other piggy.<br>  <br>  I don't know alot so i'm not sure if she will be okay since you say she is so little, but i will pray for her!<br>  <br>  Goodluck!<br>  =]|`|RjyNInW6aa	It sounds like it yeah. Either that or she has tumors. Separate the baby from the soon to be mom piggie. I didn't separate my 2 and the one not having pups had her lags severely bitten by the mom. The mommy was a little over protective. Okay maybe a lot. good luck!|`|PVzf9JUwaa	Yes she is pregnant take her to the vets to see if she is healthy and everything is in working order [: There pregnant for about 62- 70 days then split the girls and boys up after 4 weeks [: Gooood Luck ;}|`|J80ImgAUaa	she is pregnant, pregnant piggies don't do much but lie around all day.Don't pick her up for nothing that could injure the piggies to come plus move th other young piggy cause the mother to be will get defensive plus once she give birth if any of the piggies are male in about two to three weeks the male piggies haves the capacity to pregnant a female piggy. Piggies have the capacity to reproduce in a very young age different from other rodents. Hope i helped and good luck.  PS. I have three piggies two peruvian a female and a male the other one is a female silkies
7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	Its sounds like you doing everything correct. The problem is you really can't get that upset until around six months to a year. I have a Caterhula that does the samething. She is either in her crate or outside. Until she gets it.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	Get rid of the  potty pads in the house and do not use them outside either.    When you put the puppy outside if she does not go then put her back in her crate for a little bit.       Then put her outside  again till she does go potty.|`|AA10231002	She's confused and you are not paying enough attention to her.<br>  Dogs - evan puppies- talk to us non-stop every waking moment of every day.It's up to you to realize that your pup can't say HEY-I GOTTA GO.She uses her whole body to communicate her needs.And you have to watch her for signs of what she's saying.She's just like having a toddler underfoot so you need to keep one eye on her 24/7.<br>  You were'nt potty trained in a day and neither will your pup be.Accidents are bound to happen.But you can cut down on them if you start watching her a little more.Then you'll see she's roaming the room with her nose occasionally going to the floor.She may go to the door or where a pad used to lay but a dog being a dog has to find just the right spot to do it's buisness.When you see her do this you need to get her outside and keep her out until you see she's done everything she needs to do.If she's already pooped she probably won't have to again for at least a couple of hours unless she was interrupted.<br>  Put her on a schedule and stick to it.First thing every morning you have to go straight to the bathroom right?Well so does she.Put her out on your way and leave her out there while you do what's absolutely necessary.Bring her in and feed her then about 15-20 minutes after she eats take her out again and play with her or take her for a walk but don't think about letting her inside until she's done everything she should do.How long this takes is up to you.The faster she moves the faster she'll go.Exercise helps everything move the way it should.I'd plan on being out with her at least 45 minutes.<br>  She'll be thirsty when she comes in.Let her drink and put her outside again about 15 minutes later.If that's not possible then she should be confined to the room you've put pads down for her to use.Cover as much of the floor as possible.Dogs don't like to potty where they eat or sleep.They only do so if they're made to.So leave a small part of the room for food,water and a blanket for her to lay on and playspace.You're daily going to cut down the area covered with pads.And as soon as you get home  put her outside and stay with her until you see she's gone unless it's obvious she just went on a pad.But within 30 minutes of you coming home you need to again take her out.And every hour or 2 after that until you go to bed.Depending on her size and how much you notice her drinking.Everytime she goes outside you need to go with and play with her until she goes.If weathers nasty then take her to the room with the pads and play with her there until she goes.Then clean up the mess.<br>  <br>  There'll be lots of times you can't go out with her so give her outside toys to play with.Soccer balls are great for them to chase around and try to chew.Tie a knot in the middle of an old sock and toss that out there for her to chew and toss around and tennis balls and plastic squeaky toys will give her something to occupy herself with until the need to go strikes but while she's out you need to watch her from a window where you'll go un-noticed.<br>  Always remember that you can't go potty on command and a dog should'nt be expected to either.|`|AA10806778	IT ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL MY SISTER POTTY TRAINED HER CHIHUAHUA FOR LIKE 3 TO 4 MONTHS NOW...RIGHT NOW HE'S ABOUT 7 MONTHS AND HE JUST LEARNED TO POTTY TRAIN PROPERLY OUTSIDE...BEFORE THIS HE USED TO PEE SOMETIMES ON THE CARPET, SHE ALSO WAS VERY FRUSTRATED WITH HER CHIHUAHUA, CUZ HER YORKIE WAS VERY SMART AND GOT THE WHOLE POTTY TRAINING THING DONE IN LIKE A WEEK...IT ISN'T A VERY BIG DEAL YOU JUST NEED TO BE PATIENT WITH YOUR DOG|`|PSGJZLUbaa	It just takes time, sorry.    She is learning so keep up your training and try to ignore her infrequent mishaps.<br>  <br>  O'm not a dog person but I do have 3 children.   I have trained my dog better than I trained my kids.  hehehe    <br>  <br>  I used a spray water bottle with the barking issue as my dog was already fearful of water. ( we got him from the dog shelter when he was 4 mths old.)   the water spraying really works... I just have to pick up the bottle and my dog retreats to his kennel where he knows it's safe.   No-one is allowed to touch him when he's in there.  good luck and try to be patient.|`|qWXfvjqraa	First of all this is a BABY! You have to remember that.She's going to have accidents,just like a human baby would.Puppies tend to test the limits of their owners.Dogs look at us as other dogs,they have to find their rank in the group.I withhold affection when one of my dogs crosses the line,a few hours of the cold shoulder usually makes them think over bad behaviour!As for barking,alot depends on the breed and size of your puppy.When people come over,reassure her,pick her up and introduce her to whoever comes in the house,this way she knows they are accepted by you and she can relax.
378b13982f38188afccdf2a26222cf1eaa	You sound like you love your piggy friends lots!!! Good job.<br>  I own three myself. The answer above is absolutely right about the pellets!!!!! <br>  1. Make sure they have a non stop supply of a grass hay(not alfalfa which is a legume based hay)-Most people use timothy hay-orchard grass is yummy too.<br>  2. You did not mention bedding materials but carefresh or carefresh ultra is safe and absorbant. Avoid pine and cedar which contain phenols and can damage pet's respiratory tracts. Sawdust is too dusty. Aspen is good and safe.<br>  <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/bedding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/bedding.ht...</a><br>  3.Limit the broccoli to 2x per week and give small amounts because it has a good amount of calcium which can cause bladder stones in guinea pigs. (it is good for vitamin c tho)<br>  4.Parsley also has a lot of calcium so beware. <br>  5.Romaine is good for them-as well as red leaf, and green leaf lettuce and red, green, or yellow belle peppers. <br>  6.Apples and citrus fruits may cause mouth sores when given too frequently. The sugars in them, although natural, can cause obesity or diabetes. So limit fruits to 2x/week. Those are all good fruits though! :O)<br>  7. When letting them outside just be sure that the yard has no pesticides or animal poop on it. Limit their grass intake since it has been known to cause bloat. An enclosed area with a top is a must in case of other animals.Supervision is required.<br>  8. I am sure they are happy you are such a good piggy owner to inquire about their well being!! <br>  Someone said this before and they are right, vita c drops can affect the taste of their water and turn the piggy off to drinking.(may lead to dehydration) You may want to stop using them. They get enough C fortified veggies to keep them healthy.<br>  9. Nails should be trimmed every 3-5 weeks or as needed and be careful of the quick. Have styptic powder available in case. If you're uncomfortable, have your vet trim their nails. Upside down clay saucers or rocks can help file their nails naturally so trimming will be less often.<br>  Sounds like they have a good, safe, and entertaining home. <br>  if you have any piggy q's:<br>  ashleyjuliette22@hotmail.com<br>  You are doing really well with your piggles.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	If they're getting proper food that isn't too old, and fresh veggies, the vitamin C drops aren't necessary. If anything, they might make the water taste funny and put the pigs off drinking it.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't feed them guinea pig mix at all - a plain pellet is best for them! Look for one that has timothy hay as the first ingredient, if they're adults. Pigs under a year can get alfalfa pellets, but then should be switched to timothy. <br>  <br>  Some other veggies that you might want to try are kale, swiss chard, mustard greens, dandelions - those are my pigs' favorites!<br>  <br>  Sounds like you're doing a great job so far =)|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Sounds pretty good. I have a massive list of foods they can and cant eat on our guinea pig forum. We also have tons of other information and are pretty helpful if something happens or you have questions...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cavygalore.proboards.com/index.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavygalore.proboards.com/inde...</a><br>  <br>  come check it out! Its FREE and very fun!!!|`|RjyNInW6aa	I feed my pigs lettuce and veggies in the morning. They have hay and pellets in their cage all day. that's what I have been doing for years. do the same at night and refill the pellet bowl if you don't want to be woken up at 4 in the morning. I wouldn't advise the drops in the water because my pigs wouldn't drink it but as long as they drink it should be fine. it sounds like everything else is good. Congrats on the new family members!|`|YFTZM86maa	I'll second and third the drops as unnecessary.  All sites I've been on that discussed drops say don't use them.  A guinea pig mix food can add weight..too much weight.  Pigs can get spoiled, like mine, and won't eat just pellets, so adding a pinch or two of  a blend ( with no seeds) to pellets helps.  You can switch out food over a 2-3 week period, and most bags of food will give guidelines on how to do that.  <br>  When outside, be sure that the run has a cover so predators can't get at the pigs.  Worry  about large birds swooping in!<br>  Also, do a weekly health check.  Check over the entire body for masses, missing hair, cuts, fluid discharge and foot and nail problems.<br>  Sounds like you are doing an excellent job so far!|`|aBwQ06A6aa	You're doing great. And I'm glad you do the vitamin C drops, it's  very good for them! Just one thing, though, you should bathe them every week or so. Just use shampoo (no conditioner) and make sure it's unscented. Lather them up like u would ur own hair. You can do this in a bucket filled with lukewarm water. When you rinse their hair u can use a cup, do it very gently and make sure nothing gets in their eyes. You may be doing this already, so i typed it all for nothing, lol.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!! :D|`|mDcQxod0aa	Sounds like your going a wonderful job.<br>  Remember never to give them iceberg lettuce. & Make sure the food you give them is clean and good. :)

FPaJpqmNaa	Jahrhunderte lang glaubten die V?lker Europas an die Existenz eines Rattenk?nigs, der seine Untertanen, alle Ratten der Welt, von einem Thron aus ineinander verschlungenen Rattenschw?nzen regiert. Natürlich eine rein fiktionale Vorstellung, aber dennoch eine altertümliche Erkl?rung für ein Ph?nomen, das es in der Natur tats?chlich gibt: Eine eigentümliche Erscheinung, bei der mehrere Ratten mit den Schw?nzen verknoten und nicht mehr voneinander loskommen. Warum so etwas passiert, k?nnen Forscher bis heute nicht eindeutig sagen. Von einigen wird vermutet, dass eine durch Krankheit hervorgerufene Ausschwitzung der Rattenschw?nze das Aufeinanderkleben derselben zur Folge hat. Theorien gibt es jedoch viele, plausible wie eher unwahrscheinliche. <br>  <br>  Interessant ist, dass das Rattenk?nig-Ph?nomen fast ausschlie?lich bei Hausratten (Rattus rattus) auftritt, eine m?gliche Erkl?rung w?re daher folgende: Es wurde festgestellt, dass die Bildung von Rattenk?nigen h?ufig in der dritten bis vierten Lebenswoche erfolgt, zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem die Tiere zwar schon frei beweglich, jedoch noch auf mütterliche Pflege angewiesen sind. Ebenfalls in diesem Lebensalter erreichen Jungratten eine Entwicklungsstufe, wo die Schw?nze überproportional in die L?nge wachsen und diese noch sehr biegsam sind. Eine m?gliche Verknotung der Schw?nze ist hier am wahrscheinlichsten. Auch das thigmotaktische Empfinden der Hausrattenschw?nze (= reflexartiges Umwickeln eines Fremdk?rpers nach Berührung) k?nnte bei der Bildung von Rattenk?nigen eine nicht unwesentliche Rolle spielen.<br>  <br>  Verkleben mehrere Ratten miteinander, bedeutet dies nicht unbedingt das Todesurteil für die Tiere. Ganz im Gegenteil, auch in solchen Situationen zeigt sich das enorme Gruppen- und Sozialverhalten der schlauen Nager. Es gibt Belege dafür, dass die bewegungsunf?higen Tiere von ihren Artgenossen liebevoll gepflegt und mit Nahrung versorgt werden, sodass sie problemlos noch einige Zeit weiter leben k?nnen. <br>  <br>  Funde von aneinandergeknoteten Ratten sind seit dem Altertum bekannt, einer der letzten wurde 1963 in Holland gemacht. Nur in den wenigsten F?llen konnten die entdeckten Rattenk?nige für die Nachwelt erhalten werden, sodass heute leider nur mehr eine sehr geringe Anzahl an pr?parierten Exponaten verfügbar ist. Im Naturkundlichen Museum in Altenburg wird derzeit der gr??te Rattenk?nig der Welt aufbewahrt und noch dazu der einzige, der als Mumie erhalten werden konnte. In Deutschland gibt es nur noch in G?ttingen, Hamburg und Stuttgart je ein Alkoholpr?parat. Der Altenburger Rattenk?nig besteht aus 32 mit den Schw?nzen verknoteten Ratten, wobei von manchen Tieren auch die Hinterfü?e in den Knoten eingebunden sind. 27 Ratten sind genau zu erkennen, 5 liegen verdeckt bzw. sind nicht mehr vollst?ndig erhalten. Alle Ratten sind ru?geschw?rzt und ohne Fellhaare. Die Ratten werden anhand von Sch?delmerkmalen den Hausratten (Rattus rattus) zugeordnet. <br>  <a href="http://www.rattz.de/rattzelei/rattenkoenig.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rattz.de/rattzelei/rattenkoen...</a><br>  <br>  oder schau mal hier (alle mit Foto):<br>  <a href="http://www2.t-online.ch/c/26/10/31/2610316.html" rel="nofollow">http://www2.t-online.ch/c/26/10/31/26103...</a><br>  <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattenk%C3%B6nig" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattenk%C3%...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rattenwelt.de/koenig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rattenwelt.de/koenig.html</a>|`|99086a2ce29186b01401c24a692255ccaa	Einen Rattenk?nig gibt es beim Kegeln. Das ist derjenige, der die meisten Ratten hat, d.h. wer die meisten Kugeln in die Bande gespielt hat!!!|`|0a19bae0b0cd10f54bd8b508ff221814aa	Ein Rattenk?nig ist ein selten beschriebenes Ph?nomen vor allem unter Hausratten. Als Ursache für die Entstehung geben manche Quellen an, dass sich die Schw?nze einer ganzen Anzahl von Tieren verknoten und die Tiere anschlie?end durch Blut, Schmutz und Exkremente zus?tzlich an Beinen und Flanken verkleben. In der Folge sollen die Tiere untrennbar an den Schw?nzen verwachsen, die vielfach gebrochen sind. Allerdings wird diese Spekulation von der Fundlage nicht gestützt. Ohne Verknotung lebend zusammen klebende Ratten und zusammen gewachsene Ratten sind nicht dokumentiert. Fast alle Funde sind nur an den Schw?nzen verknotet. Die einzige Ausnahme, der Rattenk?nig von Altenburg (unten) klebt durch Mumifizierung zusammen.<br>  <br>   <br>  Frühneuzeitliche Abbildung eines Rattenk?nigsDie Ursache für die Verwachsung soll in zu engen Bauten liegen, in denen vor allem Jungtiere zu eng beieinander liegen und so die Verklebung und gegenseitige Verletzung stattfinden konnte. Viele Rattenk?nige sollen lebendig gefunden worden sein. Diese Entstehungsgeschichte der Rattenk?nige steht jedoch unter anderem im Widerspruch zum bekannt ausgepr?gten Komfortverhalten von Ratten. Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen, welche die natürliche Entstehung der Funde zweifelsfrei nachweisen, gibt es nicht. Die natürliche Entstehung von Rattenk?nigen nach dem oben genannten Schema wird daher h?ufig bezweifelt, viele einschl?gige Quellen halten ein natürliches Vorkommen für nicht gesichert oder behandeln das Thema nicht. Als Ursachen sind auch postmortale Verklebung oder Mumifizierungen und Manipulation (etwa Zusammenbinden der Schw?nze get?teter Ratten) denkbar. Nach Meinung englischer und franz?sischer Quellen handelt es sich beim Rattenk?nig um einen alten Mythos des deutschen Sprachraums, teilweise auch des niederl?ndischen und d?nischen, der aus zuf?lligen Funden von im Spiel an den Schw?nzen verknoteten Ratten entstanden ist. Die meisten Funde werden dort als Manipulation und Mumifizierung skeptisch betrachtet. Au?erhalb Mitteleuropas, Frankreichs, des Baltikums, D?nemarks und eines Fundes auf Java wurden nirgendwo Rattenk?nige thematisiert und Funde ausgestellt.|`|7780d21f873eef86c20038c37af480ebaa	Was ein Rattenk?nig ist,haben die Vorschreiber schon aus Wikipedia und anderen Quellen geschrieben. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://freenet-homepage.de/mauritianum/rattenking.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://freenet-homepage.de/mauritianum/r...</a><br>  hier ist ein Photo....erstaunlicherweise wurden diese Rattenk?nige von den anderen Ratten am Leben erhalten..

px27V5N9aa	They are acting their age!<br>  <br>  More ground work and reaffirm that you do not tolerate any 'horse play'.  They need to wait til you are gone before they act like kids.<br>  <br>  That's all you do...act like their mom and let them know that you will not tolerate ill manners. :)<br>  Aren't they just adorable though at this age?  Makes ya wanna hang them at times! LOL|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Turning them out with an older mare would help a lot. She'll teach them manners.|`|iy3NISVGaa	It is widely thought, especially here in Germany, that youngstock need to go through the "terrible teens" with others of the same age. This way they learn respect for other horses and understand that biting and kicking hurts.<br>  All youngsters at most studs are turned out in same-gender herds after weaning and they stay together until 2 and a half, when they are brought in for backing. This is done here very quickly, which I don't agree with, but that's another story. ( I must say I do not do this. My babies come in their own box every night so they learn to be separated and so I have them in the hand and they get checked every day.) <br>  I think the suggestion of finding an older mare to teach them some manners is feasible, but the poor dear would get no respite.<br>  Make sure they still respect people by being very firm and consistent but not aggressive when handling them. And please don't overdo the handling. This will make them sour and cause even more problems. Never forget they are still babies.|`|8cikAYp3aa	think of yearling as the "terrible two's" of childhood.  or worse being a "preteen".. they push all boundarys, develop selective deafness where your voice is amazingly beyond their ability to hear, unless its with the food dish.  <br>  <br>  now more then ever its important you enforce that your the leader, you will not tolerate nor be part of their games and bad behavior isn't permitted.  Carry a crop if you need to.  don't let the bite or rear with you.  Dont allow them to charge or drag you. Make a point of working on ground maners, and requireing them to stand still for grooming, hoof care, to lead politely and stand tied ( with you near by/within sight)  if you dont the problem will quickly get worse.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	You need to enlist proper help to train them at this stage.  To have one is a handful but two is impossible. <br>  <br>  Get local. Ask around at stables, farms, tack and farm shops, et c., for help.<br>  <br>  Dartmoors can have real potential, as I am told, but I do not hang hopes on any specific breed. It is the qualities of every specific animal that counts.<br>  <br>  During these trying times, attempt to find the endearing qualities in each filly. Before long, they will become mares that will have their own heat-and-season-related issues. Love it or leave it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!|`|AA10776535	I have one that will be a year old in April, he just started doing crude he has never done, he bit my mother.

He thinks he has better things to do than listen to me and thinks he can do his own thing. You have to be firmer with them and let them know who is boss. My gelding tries to do all sorts biting, rearing, bucking, running near me, etc. And I've had to be a lot firmer with him especially through the winter when he's inside of his stable a lot more. You're just going to have to be persistent and make them remember their manners again.|`|5kUxkun3aa	we have 3 filly's in a shed and 2 colts in another. as they are only yearlings we do not mess with them to much. they are handled when we have to. farrier comes every 6 wks. when the weather gets better they will start to go out in the paddocks through the day until summer then they will be turned out all the time. that is the way we do it every year.<br>  come october they will come in and start their training.<br>  be careful you are not expecting to much from them. they are young and they learn by play.|`|wKCgaoZVaa	The best bet would be to train them using Parelli methods.  If you go to www.parelli.com  and then click on solve my problem, taking a look through them all and just go from there.  Its a really great method as its speaking their language and yet works for you too.  Just never get angry as horses don't understand anger.<br>  <br>  Make sure they have plenty of turnout with shelter and fresh water so they can kick up their heels and get rid of that excess foal energy. Only do short sessions with them as foals get bored pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck with it all =)|`|2dJIJr6uaa	are they in the fields on their own? as if they were with other older horses (probably better to put them with the mares) they should learn to calm down :)|`|a0ZvQVdcaa	You should separate them defiantly i.e. Put one in one livery and the other at home or something :)

nWvmwijuaa	D’après une légende, le cygne, sentant venir sa mort, chante de fa?on merveilleuse, et une seule fois. Le chant du cygne représente donc plusieurs choses : l’approche de la mort ; le fait que juste avant de mourir, comme s’il disait adieu à la vie, l’animal fait la plus belle chose qu’il a jamais faite. Et c’est bien ?a qui est tragique : c’est la plus belle chose et c’est la dernière.<br>  <br>  Alors l’expression chant du cygne, on l’emploie d’abord pour les artistes : si le dernier roman d’un écrivain est son plus beau, on dit, c’est son chant du cygne. Le dernier disque d’un musicien, le dernier tableau d’un peintre… Mais on parle de chant du cygne, même si on n’est pas dans le domaine de l’art. Pour un homme politique par exemple, s’il se lance dans une grande opération, mais qu’on sent qu’il arrive au bout de sa carrière, on peut dire : ? C’est son chant du cygne ! ? C’est à dire qu’on pense que c’est la dernière mission importante qu’il pourra accomplir. Un peu comme un testament, un dernier travail où l’on met toutes ses forces, tout son talent.|`|28d89fb4824567a18934e45cb20da383aa	ce serait un chant d'amour; les cygnes malgrè tout ce qu'on en pense à propos du vilain petit canard, symbolisent l'amour eternel et la fidélité.|`|53OCQtc7aa	Le jour du jugement dernier,entendre enfin satan dire :<br>  "j'ai perdu"|`|dd4d5ab96eec23e18bc163bce276dec6aa	Faire coin coin coin coin sur un air de Beethoven !<br>  Tout cela à tire d'aile, bien s?r.|`|r8UXwHO1aa	heu...

yhly3ecLaa	Salut,<br>  Les ours sont les bienvenus en Suisse, en tout cas pour une partie de la population. 2 ours venant du nord de l'Italie, se promènent dans le parc national des Grisons, il mangent occasionellement un mouton, sinon c'est une attraction touristique importante. <br>  Le derniers  ours a été tué vers 1850. En Suisse, il n'y a pas de la place pour beaucoup d'ours, mais quelques uns, pourquoi pas. Comme dans une région d'Espagne ou il y en a une bonne quantité (Covadonga je crois).<br>  <br>  En Suisse la (re)venure de l'ours et du loup est un des thèmes parlementaires les plus "chauds". Les chasseurs disent que ces bêtes sont réintroduites. Je pense que non. Ils ont fait partie de la faune traditionnelle de l'europe centrale et occidentale depuis la nuit des temps. Etiquetés comme des boucs émissaires ils ont été chassés et pourchassés. Exterminés. Maintenant ils reviennent.<br>  <br>  La cohabitation du loup et de l'ours avec notamment le pastorage ovin et bien compliqué en Suisse. L'ours n'est revenu très récemment. Pour le loup, il y a un "concept loup", qui fonctionne à peu près :  plus d'environ 30 moutons égorgés = on tire un loup. Les moutonniers sont plus ou moins dédommagés. <br>  Pour l'ours , cela devrait être plus simple:<br>  - Il n'est que partiellement carnivore.<br>  - Il a une image bien plus favorable que le loup. Ours - ourson - Teddy Bear. <br>  Il suffit qu'il ne devienne pas un animal apprivoisé, car là l'ours mange aussi les humains. Sinon, il s'en fuit.
sRVI44jeaa	I own Golden retrievers and they are very smart and easy to train. They do need regular brushing and shed a lot of hair.<br>  I don't know about when they are crossed with a Lab. But make sure the parents have been xrayed and checked for hip/elbow dysplasia as both breeds suffer from it. If your pup has hip dysplasia it will cost thousands of dollars to help fix it.<br>  Consider a pure bred Golden Retriever they are fantastic.|`|12e67832e3db94d47bafc734b06e4b47aa	YOU DO NOT IN-BREED DOGS or MIX THEM WITH ANOTHER BREED!!!!!<br>  <br>  Sorry but I just don't know what is wrong with every one asking this kind of question.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to breed so the pups would be Mutts Mongrels?????<br>  there are so many of these in homes shelters etc & ALL dog do need looked after no matter what the breed, the longer the coat the more you groom them some breeds are aggressive some are not but the aggression is usually due to there owner not taking responsibilty  for there dogs|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	they need obedience training just like all other dogs.     the amount of brushing will depend on the type of coat the dog has.  have you seen both parents of the puppies?       the are just mixed breed.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	Goldens shed profusely.  I mean PROFUSELY!  You need to use a shedding blade on them daily.  But Goldens are wonderful dogs.<br>  <br>  We have had 2 golden/lab crosses.  Both are spayed females.  They are my favorite dogs in the world for temperament and desire to please.  They are easy to train and love to be near you. They weigh about 75 lbs. We also have a golden that spayed.  She sheds more than the lab crosses and her hair is longer.  All of ours have been house dogs, but many people here in the middle of farm country keep their dogs outside.  The only high-maintainance part about them is the shedding.  They do eat loads to keep up their body weight.  I've never owned a pure lab, but the crosses are wonderful.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember is that both breeds are prone to hip displasia.  It's a genetic disease that requires hip replacement or amputation.  You want to have your puppy checked early to make sure she doesn't show signs of the disease, especially if you pay  a lot for her. Some breeders will guarantee hips in these dogs.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	I too own Golden's and they are wonderful dogs.  Very smart and easy to train.  Of coerce you will have to bring it to obedience training but once trained Golden's retain all that they learn.  Golden's are very loyal to their families and also very friendly to other dogs.  It is important to seek out a very good breeder and carefully check them out.<br>  Labs have the same temperament as a Golden and are also very friendly.  Labs tend to be a bit more hyper than a Golden and retain this for a bit longer.  Both breeds needs regular grooming and excellent vet care.  Which ever you choose or even a blend they are wonderful dogs to own.|`|0xJZJggVaa	1. No they aren't hard to maintain. They will need a lot of brushing.<br>  <br>  2. All dogs need grooming and regular vet visits. Ear infections can be a factor, especially if they are in the water a lot.<br>  <br>  This is a very nice mix though. Usually both these breeds love to swim and retrieve. I would recommend obedience classes.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new dog.

sRVI44jeaa	Since she is 4yrs old you should have noticed when she has been in season before, take note of the times between each season then you will have a rough guess as when she will come in again. for eg. she was in Jan 06 then Aug 06 she comes into season every 7months approx, so she would be due again March 07. A b*itch can go into season every 6 to 12months. If you can't ever remember her having a season maybe she was spayed before you got her.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	she should have been in season every 6 months to 9 months.    if she has not been season i would have your vet check her out.

Quite a few things could make him sterile.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Parvo is a virus and unless it rendered him sterile then he is capable to produce puppies.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	i never have heard of it causing  that problem.        i hope that you are using him at stud because he fits the standared for a rottie that is being show in the breed ring.|`|fr2FolfSaa	Actually i have a question for you..what signs did your puppy show when he had parvo and how long did it take for the virus to pass because unfortunatley i bought i puppy this past saturday and he got parvo a couple days after we got him and im going through a rough time with him.
JGq9rKBOaa	It's just a dominance thing. As long as they aren't physically harming each other, I wouldn't separate them, since they seem closely bonded.<br>  <br>  There are a few things that might help reduce any sort of territorial or dominance behavior - how much space do they have? The smaller a rabbit's cage, the more protective they tend to be. This is true for a lot of social animals - if you give them more space, they get along better. I have three guinea pigs who usually have 15 square feet, but their table broke and I had to reduce the cage size temporarily. They started rumblestrutting, mounting, and barbering more than usual, but went back to normal once they had their space back.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure each rabbit has a home or hiding place within the cage. At least two, maybe three options in the cage. Nothing expensive - my rabbit's favorite is a cardboard box with two doors cut into it. If you don't have room in the cage for 3 cardboard boxes, that's a definite sign that your cage is too small!<br>  <br>  If they're in an indoor cage, and you don't want to spend money on a larger cage, I'd recommend expanding with a puppy exercise pen. They're about half the price of a large "rabbit cage" (which tend to all be far too small) and about 2-3 times the size.|`|m32Oq4cfaa	Definitely dominance.  Just let them be, as long as they aren't fighting.  I have an altered pair and they still do this from time to time.  It's normal.|`|Cp8Y0cHcaa	Only way to stop it is to get them both de-sexed<br>  <br>  She is showing the other one she is the boss, in charge.<br>  <br>  It can get a whole lot worse<br>  <br>  They need to be separated, she can really harm her.<br>  <br>  Had to separate my two females, but they still fought through the wire, and ripped open my bunnie's lip.<br>  <br>  Had to go to the Vet.<br>  <br>  separate and please get them de-sexed<br>  <br>  only way to bring back piece, and so they can live together happily, with no humping or fighting.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	I'm not 100% sure what you meant by "they have both been done", but if you meant they have both been spayed, I will agree with the other answerer's about this behavior being a display of dominance. Socially speaking, female rabbits can be good friends, but usually don't make very good roommates for the exact reason you have described. One rabbit will almost always attempt to assert itself as the leader. She wants to make sure the other rabbit understands who is boss. Since she is getting rather vicious about it, it suggests she isn't completely confident in her role. If the other rabbit continues to be completely submissive, the dominant one may stop, or at least tone down this behavior once she is completely sure of herself as leader. However, if the other rabbit starts trying to defend herself it could turn into a bloody fight resulting in serious injury to either one or even both of your rabbits. I recommend separating the two. It can be a pretty miserable existence for the submissive rabbit if the rabbits continue sharing the same living area. You can still allow them to spend time together outside their cages, but if the behavior resurfaces during their play time together, you'll have to let them out to play at different times.<br>  <br>   If you meant something else besides them both being spayed, I would say the aggressive rabbit is in heat and wanting bred, her behavior is an attempt to entice the other rabbit into breeding her, and it will continue until she is either bred or the two are separated. Hope this helps.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its a show of dominance and territory ..seperate them ..they could kill eachother

hTFMeCvEaa	Make sure they are really hot spots.  Hot spots are not contagious to other animals or to humans.  However, some skin conditions such as ringworm ARE, and may look very similar.  Your BF's dog chews sores on himself because he's itchy for some reason.  This could be fleas (which could spread to your dog), or an allergy to something such as food, or because he's been bathed too often or not often enough, or has the type of hair coat that clumps when it sheds and traps moisture close to the skin.  Don't wait "a few days" to begin treating hot spots.  Shave the hair away from the sores and clean them gently with warm water then let them air dry.  There are various medications that you can put on the hot spot to help heal it, but in general stay away from sticky oily ointments that would hold the moisture in.  You want to keep the hot spots as dry as possible.  They can easily become infected, and the dog may need antibiotics to cure that.  The biggest thing is to track down the reason for the "itchies" and solve that problem.  The poor dog is most likely pretty miserable.  Good luck!  Hot spots can be hard to treat, but you don't need to worry that the sores themselves are contagious to anyone.|`|UQjd93Pxaa	No. No and No|`|ucfHCJVraa	LMAO!!!<br>  NO!!

Si se les ense?a desde peque?os no tienen miedo y pueden ser muy cari?osos. <br>  Un conejo bien cuidado puede llegar a los 10 a?os perfectamente. Si tienes varios es mejor castrarlos. Son silenciosos.′Aún así aconsejo a todo el mundo que quiera un conejo que se informe antes de tenerlos hay muchas páginas buenas que te explican su cuidado y un buen libro, para evitar sorpresas. Y NUNCA reegalar un animal sin preguntar a su propietario y si es para un ni?o hay que tener en cuenta que los padres deben de estar deacuerdo ya que en muchos casos los aborrecen y son los padres los que se tienen que ocupar del animal, además pueden da?arlo si no lo cogen bien ya que tienen una columna vertebral que se fractura con facilidad.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, los conejos no transmiten ninguna bacteria que hace que se caiga el pelo, es cierto que pueden tener ti?a (hongos) que se puede contagiar, pero también los perros y los gatos y tiene un fácil tratamiento. Si quieres tener más de uno mejor castrar, especialmente en las hembras ya que tienen facilidad para desarrollar tumores de utero.|`|8lfL3XuXaa	eso es precioso y si le cuidas tu de peque?o incluso t dejara k lo cojas y no t morderá a gente k los da gratis.<br>   <br>  <br>  xao.|`|9kj0RNmnaa	No lo recomiendo.Es muy delicado y costoso en su mantenimiento,aunque sea un animal entra?able y tierno(especialmente para los ni?os).<br>  Saludos.|`|DaOIip2caa	Me parece una buena opcion para un piso, por no tener problemas de espacio y no dar problemas a los vecinos con ruidos molestos.<br>  Mis vecinas tienen uno y están encantadas con él. <br>  Lo que si es cierto que no puedes coger un conejo silvestre del campo y meterlo en la casa, aunque sea recien nacido, porque no lo soportan.

ltIuUBXNaa	My best suggestion is to try to google the info, but I'm not sure if they have been well studied. What type of behaviors are you looking for? You also want to know how long it takes to carry out the behaviors; in order to attempt to answer that aspect of your question we would need to know which behaviors you are interested in.  When & what they eat? Temperment? How they go through "normal, everyday life"? I would look it up under Berber Skink studies, the care sheets that are available are based on wild behavior as much as possible.|`|RkK673VHaa	can u be a bit more specific on how much detail and exactly what u need to know,|`|q4gAzykQaa	I am not understanding the meaning of berber skinks so tell me the meaning of this word first.

They love stragers too they normally won't bark at them just sniff.<br>  <br>  ~good luck in getting a dog!!!
70f5a199bf3d7a3a30b71dfb3f8c36f0aa	You will not find a serious breeder anywhere that breeds yo-chons. They are not a breed but a mixed breed (mutt). There are so many wonderful mixed breed dogs in rescue shelters so why would you pay for one from a backyard breeder or a puppy mill breeder? Responsible breeders ONLY breed full bred dogs and are  always looking to perfect the breed. They do all the testing necessary to insure the parents are healthy before breeding them. Bichons need to have hips xrayed, eyes cerfed (by a dog ophthamologist) yearly, patellas certified and maybe more. You will have to get a responsible yorkie person to let you know what health tests they require. "Designer dogs" are a current fad and many will end up in shelters. Please consider rescuing a dog in need. You will not be sorry.|`|cETQuE9waa	Check at a rescue or animal shelter there are plenty cute puppies and dogs there that need homes.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	these puppies are just mixed breed puppies.     Please check your local shelters in these areas.|`|TSjjbK28aa	if they are breeding mutts and selling them, there is no such thing as a reputable yo-chon breeder.|`|YJmGf4RLaa	reputable breeders do NOT breed mixed breed dogs.   So there are none.   backyard breeders  manufacture these.  since you did not know that I suggest you wait a very long time before you buy any dog.  <br>  <br>  Look for your mixed dog in small dog rescues|`|t7tmIeyzaa	My family and I are looking for a similar mix- something good with kids and good for allergies....<br>  <br>  SaidieJane- implying someone should wait because they don't know about dogs is a bit rude.  After all, the IS the place to ask questions, right?  If you don't want to help, simply don't reply.
d5498018d53f97c8c7f315ec4d5ea570aa	Yes there is a wonderful natural product  not carried in pet stores because it has no perservatives and cannot be stored in a warehouse for months on end.  I use this on my shih tzu's and love it.  It has no bleach peroxide and nothing that will hurt the dogs eyes if you wipe across the eye area. It also comes with a powder that keeps the moisture from being absorbed by the hair.  The lady who runs this site is wonderful and will answer any questions you have.  I am posting some questions and answers from her site hope this helps.<br>  <br>   Eye Envy is the most effective product for curing runny, ugly tear stains on your dog or cat. Our solution removes tearstains effectively, safely and gently. Eye Envy is an eye treatment solution that is non-irritating and proven to prevent eye leakage and discharge, quickly and through an easy to use method that your pet will thank you for. Eye Envy also comes in an herbal version. It is guaranteed to be effective, endorsed by veterinarians, catteries, and groomers the world over. If your pet is prone to tearstains, Eye Envy is for you. It is also effective in treating urine stains, red yeast infections, food stains, helping droolers, and of course for that unsightly brown goop around the eyes that affects dogs and cats everywhere.<br>  <br>  Frequently Asked Questions<br>  <br>  Q: What causes excessive tearing and staining:<br>  A: Staining can be caused by a variety of things:<br>  <br>  Clogged or Shallow Tear Ducts: Studies indicate that 20-25% of small dogs and cats are born with closed of shallow tear ducts. Tears overflow because there the eyelid space is not deep enough to contain them. <br>  Excessive Tearing: When the face hair is wet from excessive tearing, it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria and yeast infections (AKA: Red Yeast, which causes deep reddish-brown stains); Low grade bacteria infections may also cause excessive tearing. <br>  Cutting Teeth: Cutting teeth may cause changes in the head & mouth structure of your pet, placing pressure on the tear ducts. <br>  Irritation & Allergies: Some animals get hair or eyelashes into their eyes causing irritation.  Many breeds are susceptible to allergies. Shampoos and other chemicals can also irritate their eyesSome foods cause allergic reactions; animals may also build an allergic reaction over time to a type of food. <br>  Water: Water with high mineral levels causes staining <br>  Food & Treats: Diet can play a significant role in tearing.  Many commercial foods contain additives, preservatives and food coloring. This could lead to staining. <br>  Fleas: Fleas survive in moisture, which they get from the eye or moth area. This could cause irritation and in addition red stains left behind may be from flea feces.  These are just a few reasons. There are MANY more!! <br>  Q: What is Eye Envy so different that all the other products that I've bought and don't work?<br>  A: Eye Envy works at the true problem, a bacteria infection.  Eye Envy contains a cleanser, an astringent (to dry the area) and herbal flower extract (acts as a natural antibiotic) and an antibacterial.  <br>  <br>  Eye Envy is a topical tear stain remover.  Other products are often masked as palatable supplements, taking months to work and requiring your pet to ingest antibiotics (e.g. tylan, tylosin as tartrate, collidal silver). <br>  <br>  Q:  What if I've used bleach or peroxide to clean the area around the eyes?<br>  A: Bleach/Peroxide make the hair shaft very pourous, causing the stain to set into the hair.  Eye Envy will only lighten the areas previously damaged by bleach or peroxide, but all regrowth will be clean.<br>  <br>  PLEASE do not use peroxide, bleach or woolite on your animals. <br>  <br>  Q: Is Eye Envy safe to use on my pregnant dog or cat?<br>  A: Yes.  Since Eye Envy is applied externally, it is 100% safe to use on pregnant, lactating and even small kittens (over the age of 7 weeks).<br>  <br>  Q: Should Eye Envy be refrigerated? If so, how long is it's shelf life?<br>  A: NO WE CARRY THE BRAND NEW NO REFRIDGERATION REQUIRED PRODUCT.  THIS PRODUCT HAS A SHELF LIFE OF 3-4 MONTHS.<br>  <br>  Q: Is Eye Envy applied inside the eyes?<br>  A: No.  Eye Envy is to be applied externally only.<br>  <br>  Q: What happens if a small amount gets into my pets eyes?<br>  A: There is nothing to worry about is some solution gets into your pets eyes. The ingredients are safe and have been tested. <br>  <br>  Q: How many pads come in a jar?<br>  A: There are approximately 28-30 pads per jar. Our pads are made of special material to avoid any "fuzz" from getting into your pets eyes.<br>  <br>  Q: Can I use Eye Envy on my dog/cats legs, tail, mouth area? Is it safe?<br>  A: Yes. The ingredients will not harm your animal. Also, EE can be used for chin acne and urine stains.<br>  <br>  Q: Should I refrigerate my product when it arrives?<br>  A: NO WE CARRY THE BRAND NEW NO REFRIDGERATION REQUIRED PRODUCT.  THIS PRODUCT HAS A SHELF LIFE OF 3-4 MONTHS. .<br>  <br>  Q: I have a white dog, do you recommend the powder?<br>  A: Yes! With any white animals it is recommended to use both the solution and the powder. <br>  <br>  Q: Does Eye Envy fade/bleach colored animals?<br>  A: No. The produt does not contain any peroxides or bleaching agents. Your pets hair will not discolor|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	you need to check with your pet stores in your area .    Some places carry what is called Diamond Eye.|`|FhdyUQwGaa	the stains aren't actually caused by tears (otherwise all dogs would have them) they're caused by bacteria. Talk to your vet. Usually a small amount of tetracycline (an antibiotic) added to the food will completely clear up the problem. Remember that the hair that is already stained is going to have to grow out and that takes awhile, but the problem will eventually go away.|`|O3q8Qvivaa	You can try changing their food, I found that when feeding eaglepack natural my bulldog and shih tzu had less staining.

7vpFLzhVaa	90% of the foods sold in grocery stores are at the lower end of nutrition for your dog. This website has tons of good information about different dog food brands. It explains what's good and what's not good about them. I would suggest going for an ultra premium brand with no grains (especially corn, it's a filler and offers no nutritional value) and human grade ingredients. Try Innova Evo, Canidae, Timberwolf, Solid Gold...you won't find these brands in the grocery store or Petsmart. Don't let the price fool you. Generally, you will feed less of these brands than you will of the store brands, so the cost really evens out.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a>|`|AA11039147	Well it depends on how much you want to spend on dog food.

You dont want her to end up being a breeding machine at the hands of her new owner.<br>  <br>  The only way you can know when her season is due is to keep track of when she had her previous ones.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	it would be at least 6 mo. from the last one.    Without  knowing when  it was just check her every day to see if she looks like she is swelling in the vavula area.     You might look it to getting her spayed as soon as you can then you would not have to worry|`|AA11212056	get her spaid before you rehome her if she's over 6 months old|`|ORDP5wMRaa	If you don't want to be caught unprepared than have her spayed- please. Even if you are a temp home you can charge it to her next owner- it's the responsible thing to do.|`|a77ca6320b51405076762e4f4a8a57d7aa	Was she rehomed from a rescue center? if she was it's very unusual that she hasn't been spayed by them, you could ask them to spay her before you pick her up. If you are privatly rehoming her then you need to ask her previous owners when her last season was. It's adviceable when you get her to spay her as it will make life much easier for you and the dog, not to mention limiting her chances of contracting fatal illnesses/diseases caused by being left entire. Generally signs of a ****** coming into season are eating more/less, being more affectionate, cleaning herself more, and when walking her you may notice dogs are taking particulary more interest in her. Some bitches don't show any signs of coming into season untill they actually start "spotting" blood, which will be obvious to see if you have wooden floors. She must be kept away from other dogs the entire length of her season which is usually around 3 weeks and be supervised outside etc at all times. Her exercise should be 2 or 3 lead walks around the block etc. Good luck.
bbcab637d840974186b9017ba2df9e28aa	Hola Rapa:<br>  <br>     El embarazo psicológico, no existe en perros, ese es un problema de las mujeres, en canitas se llama pseudogestación, se presenta por un desequilibrio hormonal, y de verdad que tiene que tomarse con la seriedad que tu médico te ha comentado, efectivamente por una retroalimentación negativa en las hormonas sexuales pueden predisponer a la aparición de neoplasias uterinas y en glándula mamaria. La "terapia de choque" sirve en muchas ocasiones (si es a lo que te refieres), ya que si se somete a la hembra a situaciones de estrés como, ba?o o estética, etc etc (sin maltrato) segregarán de forma natural una hormona llamada cortisol que por ser corticosteroidal es luteolítica por lo que al lisar el cuerpo lúteo se acaba la pseudogestación, PERO, esto no siempre funciona, y como tu canita tiene una historia de pseudogestaciones, puede desencadenar en Neoplasias o piometra, para lo cual deberás someterla a cirugía. El método de elección y definitivo es la esterilización (OVH) con esto se termina con el problema. Aunque también entiendo que muchas personas piensen que es un problema que tiene poca o ninguna importancia, pues algunos colegas no dan la importancia real que este padecimiento se merece. Espero serte de ayuda. Saluditos.|`|1bfb58defc075d52f16e1dcad1460d16aa	Lo que tiene tu perrita es un embarazo psicologico, tienes que llevarla al veterinario para que le de unas pastillas para cortar la leche, ya que al no tener cachorros se le puede hacer una mastitis.Seria bueno que le hicieras tener una cria , pobrecita,ya que su instinto le dice que quiere ser madre, y los de los tumores es cierto.No la sometas a ninguna terapia, es solo un desorden hormonal.<br>                         Besos Ana|`|BlDrpyM7aa	Le spasa a casi todas las perritas, el embarazo psicologico es algo que les pasa con los dias, pero hazle caso al vet y no permitas que se encari?e con peluches porque puede producir mas leche y esta se enquista causando una infeccion. Alejala de los juguetes y en cuestion de una o dos semanas la leche se secará, no traten de extrerla, tambien producirá mas, esten atentos a cambios en sus mamas como que s epongan  mas hinchadas d elo normal, estan muy rojas y les salga la leche con sangre o liquidos amarillentos, alli hayq que llevarla d einmediato.

Soy PMVZ. Espero aclarar tu duda.<br>  <br>  El problema del que sufre tu mascota se le llama "embarazo psicològico", y presenta los signos que describes.<br>  Como puedes ver, no es normal que secrete leche sin estar pre?ada. Este problema se debe a un desbalance hormonal (existe progesterona -hormona importante para mantener un embarazo, si es que hay- que esta circulante en sangre y que no deberìa estar ahì, y como no existe una destrucciòn del cuerpo lùteo -el que produce esa progesterona- este sigue presente y es lo que causa el problema).<br>  Requieres ir con otro veterinario -MVZ- para que le de el tratamiento adecuado (no digo que lo que te dijo el suyo sea incorrecto, sòlo que siempre debes pedir una segunda opiniòn, por el bien de tu mascota), que va a incluir hormonas para deshacer el cuerpo lùteo y probablemente tengan que realizarle una OVH (castraciòn) dependiendo de còmo la encuentre, porque este problema puede reincidir.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte dado informaciòn ùtil.<br>  <br>  Hasta pronto!!! ;)<br>  <br>  P.D. Creo que existe una confusión con lo que mencionan acerca de la terapia de choque: No es de forma literal el que le vayan a dar electrochoques ni nada por el estilo, es -como bien dijo ricardomvz- sólo un estado en el que al animal se le somete a estrés por diferentes vías, para disminuir o quitar los signos. Esto sucede de forma natural en algunas especies -las cabras, por ejemplo-, por eso se puede aplicar a las perras también (con las condicionantes que te aclara también). <br>  Te sugiero que sigas los consejos que da ricardomvz, pues tiene bastante experiencia en la profesión (he visto muchas de las respuestas que da y verdaderamente denotan sus conocimientos).|`|1XWgbentaa	Lo que tiene tu perrita es un embarazo psicológico, es un desorden hormonal. Por eso produce leche, la cuál al acumularse puede producirle una mastitis, y también puede provocarle un tumor! Nunca escuché eso de las terapias de choque, por las dudas no las hagas! Ve a un buen veterinario, se puede tratar con hormonas. Mi perrita sufre de lo mismo.<br>  Y deja que tenga cria, aunque sea una vez. Suerte!|`|CXZ9nNmtaa	mira lo que tu perrita tiene son embarasos sicologicos y despues de estar en celo y no haver sido cruza con un perro pasan los dias que dura el embarazo que son 60 y ella cree que tiene cachorros y produce leche no le hace da?o solo que cuida los juguetes pensando que sonn sus cachorros hay perras que ellas mismas toman su leche eso le pasaba a mi perita y no le hacia da?o para que no lo vuelva a hace en su proximo celo cruzala con un perro y una vez que tenga cachorros se le pasara y sino hazla castrar y ya no tendra este tipò de problema.suerte.|`|IfGHHVLFaa	a esto se le conoce como embarazo sicologico  y es muy  normal  que sus hormonas produzcan leche pero ten cuidado porque si no tiene crias puede que le salgan tumores en su matriz|`|JntswnP3aa	Fijate q mi perra tenia (o tiene) lo mismo. Solo que yo no estoy con ella, ya ke yo vivo en estados unidos y mi perra esta en mexico con mi papa y mi hermano.

Pero la verdad no podemos ningunas de las dos, porke se necesita que uno este pendiente y mi hermana vive con su esposo a una hora de ahi, y como ella esta embarazada casi no puede salir porke su embarazo es de alto riesgo. Mi papa y mi hermano ni se preocupan mucho por ella y como para ponerles un cargo mas, pues no creo q le hagan mucho caso.<br>  Y como dicen las demas personas, no dejes q le den electrochokes, asi no se alivia. Busca otro veterinario y asegurate que sea profecional.<br>  Saludos!!|`|KKq816n5aa	tiene <br>  el embarazo psicologico|`|aV21mScUaa	Hola la raza se escribe schnauzer, lo indicado si no tienes pensado hacerla tener cachorros es que la esterilices y asi evitarás estos trastornos que son pseudo pre?ez. Es correcto lo que te ha dicho tu veterinario sobre no permitir que agarre los peluches ya que de esta forma solo alargaras el proceso.<br>  En cuanto a la terapia de choque no tengo conocimiento de que se trata por lo que no puedo aconsejarte, <br>  Aqui te anexo un poco de informacion sobre la pseudo pre?ez:<br>  La pseudogestación es una alteración que se presenta en las perras no pre?adas después del celo, las cuales desarrollan comportamiento materno y signos físicos de gestación.<br>  <br>  La falsa pre?ez como también se la suele designar, se considera un fenómeno normal en las perras, aunque no todas lo manifiestan. Es un error común llamarlo embarazo psicológico, ya que el problema responde a una serie de cambios hormonales que determinan variaciones en la conducta de la perra y no es en sí una alteración del comportamiento.<br>  <br>  Las actividades hormonales , que ocurren en los ovarios de una perra pre?ada después del celo, son casi idénticas a las de una hembra no pre?ada en el mismo período.<br>  <br>  Los síntomas de pseudogestación comienzan seis a doce semanas después del celo. Estos pueden ser sutiles e incluir aumento de peso, incremento del apetito, agrandamiento abdominal. La perra puede elegir lugares para refugiarse la mayor parte del día como pueden ser: debajo de una cama, en roperos, sillones o en pozos cavados en el jardín. En estos sitios casi siempre escarba y rasca el piso o desarma la cucha. Se manifiesta temblorosa, lloriquea con un quejido corto. La observación más común es que las perras presentan sus mamas cargadas con leche. A veces los signos son sugestivos de un parto inminente: inquietud, irritabilidad, menor actividad física, conducta de anidación, disminución del apetito, vómito y crianza de objetos inanimados como peluches, pelotas, juguetes etc.<br>  La sintomatología por lo usual resuelve después de dos a tres semanas. En estos casos no se recomienda ningún tratamiento. Como medidas generales hay que evitar la autolactación de la perra, colocándole un collar especial alrededor del cuello para que no se lama. No aplicar pa?os calientes o fríos u otros estímulos mamarios que puedan promover la producción de leche. Impedirle toda posibilidad de arrinconarse en dormitorios, sillones etc.. <br>  Sacarla muchas veces por día a caminar para que se distraiga. Dan más resultados muchas salidas cortas que unas pocas largas.<br>  <br>  El problema clínico más preocupante que puede presentarse es la lactación, pues ésta incomoda , puede manchar cosas en el hogar, ser molesta para la hembra y es un probable sitio de infección. El ayuno por 24 horas con un retorno gradual de 3 a 5 días a la ración diaria ayuda a reducir la lactación. Si la situación no mejora se puede probar con una terapia hormonal, según indique el Médico Veterinario.<br>  <br>  La extirpación de ovarios y útero en el período de reposo sexual del ciclo previene la recurrencia del problema en forma definitiva.|`|boBlmkkWaa	La llamada pseudogestación o embarazo psicológico, es una de las dolencias mas comunes que se presenta en perras que no han sido apareadas, y puede presentarse inclusive después del primer celo, al no seguirse el curso natural de la reproducción, después del celo. En todos los mamíferos este estado es debido aun trastorno de los ovarios, asociado con el ciclo reproductor de la hembra. En circunstancias normales, tras la ovulación, aparece en el ovario un cuerpo amarillo, cuya secreción asegura el mantenimiento de la gestación. Aún cuando no haya fecundación, aparece este cuerpo amarillo, pero en este caso, degenera enseguida. Si no ocurre así, la perra se encontrará en condiciones análogas a las de un embarazo.<br>  <br>  Con el embarazo psicológico, se presentan en la perra los síntomas que tendría si estuviese realmente pre?ada, y se puede  observar:<br>  <br>  -         Vientre abultado<br>  <br>  -         Desarrollo de las mamas<br>  <br>  -         Producción de leche<br>  <br>  -         Cambios en la conducta<br>  <br>   Una perra con embarazo psicológico, se muestra nerviosa, puede tener alteraciones en su apetito, prepara el sitio para el nacimiento de sus cachorros, excavando algún agujero en el jardín, o buscando algún sitio donde esconderse. También es frecuente que adopte algún juguete, cojín o zapatilla, como cachorro, dándole a éste, el mismo tratamiento cari?oso y protector que daría a su propio hijo, inclusive puede imitar darle alimento, calor y hasta mostrarse agresiva si se le quita ese objeto. <br>  <br>  Se debe dejar que la naturaleza siga su proceso y darle un trato como si estuviera realmente pre?ada. Se le dejará tranquila, evitándole situaciones de nerviosismo, que puedan desarrollar su agresividad.<br>  <br>  Los efectos, pueden variar en intensidad, provocando cambios en el comportamiento. En aquellos casos donde la producción de leche es abundante, es necesario acudir al veterinario para que realice la medicación correspondiente, para eliminar esta producción, pues puede llegarse al caso de producirse una mastitis.<br>  <br>  Los pseudoembarazos, suelen repetirse, y no se resuelven, permitiendo que la hembra quede embarazada y críe.<br>  <br>  Los frecuentes embarazos psicológicos, pueden ocasionar que esta perras sean proclives a sufrir una infección intrauterina, denominada piómetra, que no es mas que la infección del útero, lo cual conlleva a la necesaria extracción del mismo, cuando es atacado a tiempo, pues en caso contrario, ocasiona la muerte del animal en la mayoría de los casos.<br>  <br>  La piómetra es mas frecuente en las hembras mayores de cinco a?os, y aparece tras un período de celo. Esta se revela por la pérdida del apetito, aumento de sed, de orina y además vómitos después de beber. Si no es tratada a tiempo, la perra se va debilitando, aumenta el tama?o de su abdomen, y se producen derrames por la vulva. Por lo general, al llegar a este estado, ya es necesaria la intervención quirúrgica, para salvar la vida de la perra. <br>  <br>  Así, que los embarazos psicológicos, no deben ser descuidados, o tomados como uan “excentricidad” de nuestra perra, deben ser controlados, y poner especial cuidado, para evitar que en el caso de presentarse una piómetra, pueda ser atendida a tiempo.

M3jRtq2Aaa	All dog registries are simply human creations.  They really mean nothing in the scientific sense.  Dog DNA is Dog DNA.  An AKC dog has dog DNA just like an APR dog or an AKC dog.  They mean nothing.  It's a brand name. Just register the dogs with the APR or the ACA, either will do it, and don't worry about it.  AKC is not holy or worth more than anyone else.  Any nut case can start a club and print up certificates on the computer.  It is just a brandname.  And the AKC isn't holy either.  Lots of breeders lie about the dam and sire in order to register the litter.  The AKC name mean nothing any more than any other brandname.  A dog is a dog is a dog. They all have dog DNA.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	The legitimate kennel club in the US is the AKC..

Is she an exceptional specimen<br>  of her breed, conforming closely to the breed standard? Has she any hard to<br>  find virtues that would be a critical addition to the breed? Has she been<br>  tested for genetic problems that can be passed on from the parents and does<br>  she have an exceptional temperament? Has she been shown, and at least is on<br>  her way to being a champion, if not already one?<br>  <br>  If you want to bred and do it ethically, you must be committed to<br>  learning all about your breed..its standard, its genetic diseases, the good,<br>  the bad and the ugly. You must understand that your female could die. You<br>  might have nothing but dead puppy bodies whether she lives or not. You might<br>  have to pay for an emergency c-section to save her and/or the pups. If you<br>  lose her, you are responsible for all the feeding of the pups, which will<br>  require you to feed them every 1.5 to 2 hours. ALL hours, not just the<br>  daylight ones. The puppies will poop 24/7, and this becomes your<br>  responsibility to clean whether the mother survives to raise them or not.<br>  The pups still need to be vet checked, vaccinated and dewormed no matter<br>  what. When they reach certain stages of their lives, they need proper<br>  socialization and guidance. They will be your responsibility at least for 8<br>  weeks. After that 8 weeks, you are responsible to make sure they never wind<br>  up homeless in a shelter or rescue. To ensure that, you will have to do<br>  homechecks and make up contracts to be certain the new owners are going to<br>  take care of them for life. You have to agree to always be available to take<br>  back your puppies no matter what.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a responsible breeder, look up your local breed<br>  club, jump in and educate yourself. Listen to the advice of REPUTABLE<br>  breeders and learn all you can about your dog. If you just wanna make<br>  puppies to sell for lots of money, don't bother. We have too many of those<br>  already.|`|BbuC28Qcaa	If the female is not AKC registered, no, you won't have registerable puppies.<br>  <br>  ACA is not a good registry at all, and a backyard breeder's dream registry. I suggest having your female spayed.|`|Wlrc6mp3aa	I've not heard good things about ACA but I can't say for certain as I don't have any experience with them.<br>  <br>  One way to be certain would be to contact each and ask them directly what their policy is for this type of registration.<br>  <br>  That's the only way to be sure.|`|yyP7f8mnaa	You have poor quality, puppymill puppies, registered with scam registries, and they should under no circumstances be bred.<br>  Their puppies would NOT qualify to be AKC registered.<br>  Please have them spayed and neutered asap.|`|S4dxECPIaa	Your female is from a puppymill.  Sounds like your male may be also.  Did you buy them from a pet store?  From a backyard breeder?  <br>  Anyway, no, the pups can't be registered with the AKC, the only registry that counts.  <br>  It's questionable if dogs from puppy mills are purebred.  Owner's of these mills are not real careful who breeds who.  They also inbreed a lot.  This means your dogs are probably not genectically healthy.  They would be likely to produce puppies with defects.  <br>  Best bet is to spay and neuter your dogs.|`|nvPHccPbaa	You can register anything with ACA but it doesn't mean anything. It's a pseudo-registry so bad, irresponsible breeders can breed whatever they want and not be held responsible.<br>  <br>  The only two legitimate all-breed registries in America are American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club. There's no doubt they have their problems but they have both been around for centuries and they do check up on people who register their dogs with them. If the facilities are bad or the pedigrees are mixed up (they do DNA testing), they're denied registering privileges. That's why pseudo-clubs like ACA were created.
4R34sXT2aa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  Je suis sincèrement désolée de la situation que vous vivez et je compatis à votre peine. Tous ceux qui aiment les chats et les animaux en général, qui ont connu ou non cette épreuve sont solidaires avec vous. Dites-vous bien que  vous lui aurez apporté du bonheur et que vous avez eu à son égard, un dernier geste d'amour pour l'empêcher de souffrir. <br>  <br>  Il y a quelques années, j'ai vécu aussi une situation semblable. Je ne  me suis pas posée les mêmes questions que vous et j'ai eu tort !<br>  <br>  La situation était l'inverse, "on" avait tué la fille d'Océane (Phénix) qui avait alors deux ans. D'une part cela a été difficile pour moi car quelque part c'était mon "double" animal, elle me suivait partout. Elle a été tuée un jour, ou pour une fois elle n'était pas venue à mon travail avec moi. D'autre part, pour Océane, sa mère, car elles étaient toujours ensembles quand Phénix n'était pas avec moi (au boulot, au sport, partout et c'est elle qui venait).<br>  <br>  Au bout d'une semaine, j'ai constaté qu'Océane perdait beaucoup de poils (par touffes), je me suis inquiétée sans plus car c'était aussi une période de mue. Une semaine après, elle m'a fait peur tellement elle avait maigri (pourtant je la voyais manger). Je l'ai amenée en urgence chez le vétérinaire qui n'a constaté aucune anomalie apparente. Il a tout de même pensé qu'elle pouvait faire une "dépression" et lui a donné une sorte d'anti-dépresseur. Une semaine après pas d'amélioration, j'ai bien cru que j'allais la perdre elle aussi.<br>  <br>  Mais il y a eu à cette même période un miracle : Cheyenne. C'était un chaton de quelques jours (malade et plein de puces) que j'avais failli écrasé en pleine nuit (heureusement, il a tourné la tête au bon moment et j'ai vu ses yeux). Il était couché là, dehors, en plein  milieu d'une route et seul ! Je l'ai ramassé et ramener à la maison. <br>  <br>  Vu l'heure tardive, je n'ai pas vraiment eu le temps de faire les présentations. Quand Océane a senti le bébé, elle lui a craché dessus (pas bien fort je l'avoue) et elle l'a ignoré. Ayant toujours du lait maternisé chez moi et tout le nécessaire, j'ai nourri Cheyenne et l'ai nettoyé au mieux. La visite chez le véto le lendemain m'apprend qu'il a une dizaine de jours et atteint d'un coryza dans une forme assez grave. Antiobitiques, piq?res et tout le toutim et aujourd'hui il a 6 ans. Cela dit, 48heures après, Océane le nourrissait et reprenait du "poil" de la bête. <br>  <br>  Je suis persuadée, encore aujourd'hui, que si Océane est toujours là (elle a 11 ans), c'est grace à l'arrivée impromptue de Cheyenne. Ce n'était pas prémédité car moi-même était noyée dans mon chagrin et je n'envisageais pas de prendre un nouvel animal. En fait Cheyenne nous a aidées toutes les deux. <br>  <br>  Voilà, je vous ai raconté un peu de mon histoire pour bien montrer qu'un animal peut ressentir les choses très fortement et déprimer comme les êtres humains. <br>  <br>  Pour ce qui concerne la fille de votre petite Nouchie, surveillez bien que son attitude ne se modifie pas : nourriture, jeux, utilisation de la litière. Si une anomalie devait survenir, ne faites pas comme moi, allez voir votre vétérinaire rapidement. <br>  <br>  Je ne connais pas votre situation, et je ne vous donnerai pas de conseil s'il vous faut ou non prendre un nouveau compagnon à votre petite boule de poils. Je pense que le déroulement de la situation vous guidera vers ce qu'il y a de mieux pour vous et pour elle.<br>  <br>  Au début, je pense que ?a va être dur car elle va chercher un peu partout sa mère, elle va chercher à se rassurer en vous suivant partout, soyez attentive à détourner le problème en la faisant jouer et en vous en occupant un peu plus qu'à l'accoutumée. Là où ?a risque de se gater c'est lorsque vous vous absenterez car elle était habituée à avoir de la compagnie.<br>  <br>  Si vous décidiez de lui donner un nouveau compagnon à 4 pattes, le choix a peu d'importance sur le sexe et l'age. Je me permets de vous dire de penser à faire une bonne action en vous rendant dans un refuge. Si vous faites cela, expliquez bien la situation. Et pour que votre petite locataire accepte une nouvelle présence plus facilement, n'hésitez pas à utiliser félifriend. Ce sont des phéromones de synthèse qui permettent à un animal de reconna?tre un nouveau venu (humain ou animal) comme un ami.<br>  <br>  Je vous souhaite beaucoup de courage et vous avez toute ma sympathie en ce moment difficile. Plein de caresses et de calins à la fille de votre petite et belle Nouchie.<br>   <br>  ******************<br>  <br>  Je viens de lire vos précisions complémentaires. Surtout ne culpabilisez pas, sans information vous ne pouviez pas savoir que la pillule était dangereuse pour la santé de votre minette. Normalement, en raison des risques connus, il était prévu que des indications ne nocivité soient indiquées sur la notice suite à des procès qui ont été intentés pour la même raison que vous : la perte d'un animal aimé. <br>  <br>  C'est douloureux, aussi douloureux que de perdre un ami humain n'en déplaise aux railleurs. Gardez en mémoire les bons moments et les souvenirs que vous avez partagés avec elle. Nouchie sera toujours près de vous car elle est et restera dans votre coeur à jamais. Je comprends d'autant mieux votre peine que, encore aujourd'hui, la cicatrice laissée par la mort de Phénix n'est pas guérie. Elle me manque terriblement mais j'ai dans ma mémoire tous les bons moments passés ensemble, toutes ses facéties (elle adorait l'eau) et ces images positives me réconfortent.

6ff1c5d8716046ac371e8a5ddb670780aa	You need to figure out why she is peeing so much.  Is it submissive peeing?  Is she marking territory?  Does she have to go out and just can't make it that far before she goes?  The first step is a vet exam.  The second step is getting some enzymatic cleaner to get rid of all traces of pee because with her sensitive nose any trace will say "here's the bathroom."  You can get that in any good pet store, but don't use bleach or detergent or it will become inactive.  The next step, providing she's medically okay is to start from scratch in house training.  A good reference book is "How to House Train a Dog of Any Age" by Karen London and Patricia McConnell<br>  <a href="http://www.dogwise.com/itemdetails.cfm?ID=DTB777" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogwise.com/itemdetails.cfm?I...</a><br>  Crating her while you're gone is a good way to prevent peeing too since dogs don't like to eliminate where they are sleeping and eating.  You can feed her in the crate to help make the crate a positive experience, and when you are home leave the crate door open.<br>  When you take her out and she pees outside you'll want to reward her.  You can also teach her a cue word such as "pee-pee" or "outside" or "hurry-up" ( that's what we use)  When she pees you can say "hurry-up" and then give her a treat.  Take her out a lot at first and reward her with a treat every time she pees.  Soon she'll catch on and you'll be able to say your cue word and she'll pee on command.  This works really well if you're pressed for time.  Good luck.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	Get her a crate and start putting her in it when you can not watch her and at night.

Z0KfV6RYaa	DOGS ARE NOT THE SAME AS CATS. IF YOU WANT TO POTTY TRAIN YOUR DOG CRATE THEM. THIS IS THE BEST METHOD. IT IS NOT CRUEL, IT SAVES BOTH THE ANIMAL AND YOU FROM A LOT OF HEARTACHE DOWN THE ROAD. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS AS EARLY AS YOU CAN, 8 WEEKS IS THE BEST AGE. TAKE THE PUPPY OUT OFTEN, PLAY WITH IT, LOVE IT, FEED IT, REWARD IT WHEN IT POTTYS OUTSIDE, THEN PUT IT BACK IN ITS OWN SPACE. THIS WILL NOT ONLY HELP POTTY TRAIN YOUR BABY BUT IT WILL MAKE IT SO MUCH EASIER TO MANAGE AS WELL. IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR SO. YOU MIGHT NEED TO PUT THE CRATE FAR AWAY FROM THE BEDROOMS AS THE PUP MAY YELL. YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG AND KNOW YOU ARE DOING THE BEST THING FOR ALL OF YOU. THIS METHOD ALSO GIVES THE DOG A SAFE PLACE OF ITS OWN. AFTER A FEW WEEKS, YOUR ANIMAL SHOULD BE TRAINED AND AT THAT TIME YOU CAN LEAVE THE CRATE DOOR OPEN SO YOUR BABY STILL HAS ACCESS TO ITS OWN SPACE BUT IT ALSO HAS EARNED THE FREEDOM TO GO IN AND OUT. YOUD BE SURPRISED HOW MANY TIMES THEY RUN BACK TO THEIR CRATE IF SCARED BECAUSE IT HAS TRULLY BECOME THEIR DEN.|`|HclKftzAaa	We taught our dogs to go in a litter tray.<br>  <br>  It was not too difficult, much the same as teaching them to go outside.<br>  <br>  If you see they need to go to the toilet, you run them to the tray and put them in it. If you ever see them go in the tray, you praise them a whole heap. If they make poop, put it in the tray, and show the dog, tell them 'good dog.' You can also scent the box, by buying something from the pet shop that encourages them to use that area.<br>  <br>  One thing we also did, was use the same material in the tray as what is outside (bark chips for us). If you have grass outside, then putting some grass smell in the box will teach them too.<br>  <br>  It's not cruel, with more apartment dwelling people getting pets, there are even trays available specifically for this, purpose.though they are expensive.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uniquedistributors.com/dogpotty.html?gclid=CNrfo7KO_o4CFQflhgod-yotwQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.uniquedistributors.com/dogpot...</a>|`|3ANWwYTaaa	They actually have puppy pans or boxes, made especially for dogs, check it out.

I'm pretty sure that bulldogs get pretty large so I don't think a litterbox would be feasible.<br>  <br>  Our home does not smell, because after much research I devised my own system. I bought 2 litter pans. In one I drilled small holes all over the bottom for drainage.  I took one and filled with flushable cat litter, I put the one with the holes I drilled over it. I put kennel turf in the top one (synthetic grass that drains). When my dog urinates it goes through the drainage holes down to the cat litter. I just lift off top litter pan, scoop into toilet and GONE! When she goes no. 2, I just pick up with toilet paper and flush. No mess, no smells! When we go out for walks, she has no problem going in grass, because she doesn't know the difference between the synthetic in her litterbox.<br>  <br>  To train her, I just crate-trained like you normally would, but instead of going out into a yard (which we don't have), I walked her by leash to the litterbox. By 6 months she was fully trained.|`|a37QjGnDaa	I trained my pug to use the litter box, there is dog litter to use in it.

The litter is not scoop able so became somewhat expensive to clean. $15.00 a bag. He now goes outside and doing very well<br>  Good Luck|`|azcwMiO8aa	I don't like newspapers or litter boxes for dogs, and I can't imagine a bulldog making do with a litter box.  Some dogs kinda "travel" when they do there business, so that can be messy, and it is much more natural for a dog to go outside to do his business.  We don't use a litter box for the cat, either.

She may have a health concern, I would recommend taking her to the vet to get checked out.  Is she getting sick--throwing up, loose stools?  <br>  <br>  She may not like her food either.  Try to feed her the highest quality food you can afford, don't feed her the generic store brands as these foods contain lots of byproducts and has a very low amount of good nutrition.|`|6DJ4S2I8aa	My puppy had the same problem. He just wouldn't eat that much ( well no where as much as you would expect a puppy to eat). But he grew soo quickly ( I swear he would look taller the next day) so he was skinny but not " fell every bone' skinny<br>  <br>  Get her checked out by the vet. Could be worms, or something else. The vet will advise you on whether or not its a medical problem.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, try to change what you are giving the puppy. Milk, sardines, wet dog food in addition to chow, put a little bit of meat that is really fragrant ( ie fish with no bones of course) and see if that works. <br>  I always ensure that my dogs never lose their taste for milk, so when I see that their appetite/weight is falling of for no reason, on comes the milk and sardines in the morning. They can't get enough sometimes.|`|9Db9WRDdaa	Usually, you can try adding Vita Gravy to their dry food or maybe even add some cooked chicken as well.  This is what my vet told us to do for our 4 month year old puppy.  I was hesitant at first about the cooked chicken but its not table scraps :) its just good food.  After a month or so, we stopped giving our puppy the Vita Gravy so she wont be SO finicky about her food and now she just gobbles up what we give her.  Also a couple questions, what age is the dog and how many times a day are they being fed and lastly do you leave the food there all day for them to eat?  I hope this helps.
krXQaZAfaa	A martingale is not going to prevent pulling.  If you want to train your dog to stop pulling go pickup a prong collar.|`|M4Th1EcQaa	i suggest using a harness, it really helps and gives you more control over them. <br>  Using a harness allows you to control their body, a martingale collar is the neck which can injure your dog.<br>  If you can get something that isn't needed on the neck, that is better<br>  it is easier for you to control and makes it more comforatble for you dog|`|FQskK6Jnaa	We start our puppies out on martingale collars.

3u9YHnkoaa	I gatti sono gli animali più belli del mondo proprio perché sono spiriti liberi, indipendenti e tanto tanto ruffiani. <br>  Sicuramente, confronto ai cani, si affezionano di più alla casa dove abitano che al padrone, ma comunque non si comportano nello stesso modo con tutti gli umani che vivono loro attorno. Il mio gattone mi fa capire che sono io la sua padrona e non gli altri abitanti della casa (ad esempio di notte viene a dormire sempre e solo con me. Anche se gli altri lo portano nel loro letto, lui scappa e viene da me).|`|5bae585c1654fecf2c6387e3fbf3ae04aa	me tapine, sono allergicaa!! sigh sigh...|`|6de6c51062a72957b929210dfb6663e8aa	Assolutamente si`!

I gatti hanno rapporti diversi con ogni componente della famiglia con cui vive.|`|BpZ0yFqtaa	Io ho molti gatti (11) e in casa mia son sempre stati molto numerosi. Perciò ti posso dire che non esiste una regola assoluta: chi s'è affezionato più a mia mamma, chi a mio papà, chi a me o mio fratello... Quanto a fare le fusa anche qui i comportamenti sono diversi: chi non le fa per niente e chi basta una carezza e attacca il motore. Non è detto che le facciano per fame: capita spesso che uno dei miei (si può dire a turno!) se ne arrivi mentre guardiamo la tv, salga sul tavolo facendo le fusa e...si acciambelli tra le braccia di uno di noi. E guai a respingerli: sono unghie piantate, se vogliono le coccole vogliono le coccole e bisogna guardare loro anzichè la tv!!!<br>  E le fusa spesso le fanno anche per conforto quando stanno male, e non auguro a nessun padrone di gatti di dover sentire, come già successo a me, il proprio gatto fare le fusa in punto di morte :-(|`|CJ3ycocbaa	Il mio è adorabile..

C'est une responsabilité sur plusieurs années et c'est d'ailleurs en partie pour cela que les refuges sont pleins ; passe encore pour les chats, mais il est souvent difficile d'adopter un chien qui a déjà quelques années ; il sera difficile à éduquer, risque de ne pas s'adapter et les animaux en fin de vie occasionnent souvent de lourds frais de vétérinaires que tous les budgets ne peuvent supporter.<br>  De plus, pour que l'arrivée d'un nouveau compagnon se passe bien, il faut que ce soit un choix, et celui-ci se fait selon des critères précis : race étudiée en fonction du besoin et des possibilités (chien de garde, chien de chasse, petit chien pour appartement...).Un chien jeune sera éduqué selon les principes de la famille qui l'accueille et le lien qui se noue avec l'animal fait qu'il devient un membre de la famille dont on s'occupera au même titre qu'un enfant (nourriture, soins...).<br>  Il est s?r que dans certains cas on ferait mieux d'adopter un animal à la spa plutot que d'en faire naitre, surtout pour les chats ; ils sont tous plus ou moins dociles et agréables et la plupart des chats n'ont aucune race précise. Mais là encore le choix se fait en fonction de l'age et la couleur.<br>  Pour toutes ces raisons, les commerces d'animaux de compagnie ont encore de beaux jours devant eux et les problèmes de pouvoir d'achat ne feront que défavoriser la SPA ; en plus de décourager l'adoption d'un animal, cela risque surtout de conduire à encore plus d'abandons.

Je lui ai demandé pourquoi et il m'a répondu que le fait de s'occuper de sa chatte et des chatons jusqu'au sevrage entra?nait des frais supplémentaires. Soit. Mais surtout, demander de l'argent, permettait que les gens ne prennent pas un chaton comme ?a sur un coup de tête. Les gens réfléchissent plus quand il faut sortir de l'argent, voir en retirer au distributeur. Et c'était le but recherché, que les personne qui craquent pour un des chatons se posent avant bien la question de ce que représente le fait de vivre avec un animal. Il évitait ainsi certains abandons futurs mais surtout tout risque de trafic !

cPuicv06aa	Hi there!  I have two beautiful purebreds and I absolutely love and adore them so much!  Not only are they cute and cuddly, they are kind, warm, loving and fun.  They are also very smart.  As far as children, I would say no problem, that depends also on how they are raised, like with any pet.  I brought my girls home at 10 weeks, my cats were 4 months only and everyone continues to be the best of friends after 6 years now.  I highly recommend these beautiful sweet pets.  They are very low maintenance also.  Words of wisdom, they will eat alot but don't overfeed, they like to be up high on things like sofas, etc., we built ramps ourselves for the one sofa they are allowed on so they don't jump and break their little bones....Best of luck!  I do not think you will be disappointed at all.  |`|cPuicv06aa	Hi there!  I have two beautiful purebreds and I absolutely love and adore them so much!

Him, his daughter, his grand daughter and a half brother.    I'm not really fond of the short hair personalities, but the long hairs are truly laid back and couch potatoes.  I love my hound dogs.

8970c896a046bf504ea639f7bf851576aa	Io sono un padrone di un cagnone considerato pericoloso, ho un dobermann. se la legge obbliga l'utilizzo di museruola non è per puro sfizio, ma per tutelare certe persone che come te hanno paura. io quando vado in giro col cane se devo essere sincero non gli metto la museruola poichè il mio cane ha ricevuto una certa educazione, però evito la gente perchè so che qualcuno come te, puo aver paura. quindi evito luoghi affollati, e schivo la gente che mi viene in contro. comunque la museruola, come pure i sacchetti per i bisogni, li ho sempre con me in modo da utilizzarla se serve. molte volte i cani peggiori sono quelli piccoli sono che per la loro esile stazza non posson fare molto nei nostri confronti. mi auguro di cuore che ti passi questa paura perchè sanno dare tanto e sono degli amori. se vuoi ti presto il mio cagnone per un pò cosi cambi subito idea =)|`|3d8e41cea0c064455e2bb9cef267174aaa	Museruola: NO.<br>  Ti parlo da "portatrice sana" di rottweiler, molosso che soffre assolutamente la museruola sia dal punto di vista fisico (ostacola la respirazione e con l'ausilio del caldo può uccidere il cane) che da quello psicologico (è pur sempre una violenza ed un trauma per il cane al quale viene impedito di rapportarsi al mondo col senso più congeniale nei cani e cioè gusto e olfatto). Certo la legge vuole museruola E guinzaglio sempre e ovunque, ma solo per quelle 17 razze incriminate (di cui solo 4 presenti in Italia). Secondo voi di più di 400 razze riconosciute non esistono cani più "pericolosi" dei rottweiler? Vogliamo parlare dei mastif (o mastino inglese) del peso di 90 kg e passa (a fronte dei 50 del rott) in grado di maciullare un uomo? E come questa molte altre razze che vengono ignorate perchè non di moda e non in grado da suscitare clamore come il rottweiler visto come cane "nero e cattivo". I telegiornali campano su notizie del genere senza verificarne la veridicità, ed io posso testimoniare che il mio rott (portato rigorosamente al guinzaglio ma senza museruola) è stato aggredito svariate volte da meticci di taglia piccola e ..... non ha mai nemmeno ringhiato in sua difesa.<br>  <br>  P.S. Fino a qualche anno fà il doberman era additato come cane che impazzisce a seguito di crescita smisurata del cervello. Oggi non figura nemmeno sulla lista Turco...come mai? Improvvisamente i doberman sono cani da compagnia e non più da difesa...strano no?|`|80a29710257cfbe218bfc6acc34b4a66aa	la legge prevede guinzaglio e museruola, punto. si può non essere d'accordo ,ma è la legge.<br>  Ci sono cani 'grossi e pericolosi' che sono estremamente educati perchè hanno padroni seri e responsabili, che non farebbero male a una mosca.... altri 'cagnetti' invece, maleducati e mordaci, che fosse per loro ti staccherebbero un braccio!! i padroni sono da educare...|`|f70a1c09a068c6d2079a3dd12321da00aa	io nn ho un cane "pericoloso" xò secondo me nn dovrebbero portarle le museruole i cani xkè tutti i cani nn sn ne diavoli ne angeli.<br>  io penso ke i cani siano pericolosi qnd il padrone li educa ad essere pericolosi e poi tutti i cani hanno un carattere come noi xciò se il loro carattere nn è molto dolce xkè fargli portare le museruole????????????'|`|7bda9e55f802883f5ff1d3f9691c010daa	io non ho cani, però quando avevo 6 anni sono stata aggredita da un canelupo che era lasciato a se stesso per strada con il suo padrone a pochi cm di distanza. ovviamente mi ha lasciato molto scossa, sopratutto quella bocca ringhiosa a pochi cm dalla mia faccia.......<br>  le museruole e i guinzagli servono! è inutile negarlo.|`|89115733aaa0f7a4b095a3349d4a360caa	Sicuramente chi possiede cani considerati "pericolosi" (ovvero che potrebbero addirittura uccidere una persona) dovrebbero essere muniti di museruola! <br>  Lo dico da possessore di cane!|`|9UpFbOE6aa	Sicuramente dovrebbero portarla,anche se io ho 1 dobbermann, che è tranquillissima, è più vivace il mio spitz!Io se la portassi in giro, la metterei, 1 x il rispetto delle persone che hanno paura dei cani, 2 xchè non si sa mai se va ad attaccare 1 altro cane, 3 perchè è la legge!<br>  mi è successo 1 cosa l'altro gg, portavo in giro il mio spitz, 1 bassotto-chihuahua, nn so che razza era, è riuscito a slegarsi il collare e andare ad attaccare il mio cane, si era aggrappato al collo della mia tilly!LA STAVA X MORDERE , POI HO PRESO IN BRACCIO QUELLA SPECIE DI CANE DONNOLA (era lungo e basso)E L'HO RICONSEGNATO AI PROPRIETARI,nn ho detto niente ai proprietari, ma x la sicurezza dei loro cani e di quelli degli altri dovrebbero rispettare le leggi(in questo caso mettere 1 collare + stretto!!!)IL MIO CANE E LA(DONNOLA )SI POTEVANO FARE SERIAMENTE MALE!!)dovremmo stare +  attenti!Rispettando le leggi!|`|NWYxLL6vaa	La museruola non serve assolutamente a niente... e' solo uno stupido palliativo ma non risolve il problema. non bisognerebbe obbligare i cani a metterla. A mio avviso l'unica soluzione a questo problema sta negli allevamenti e nei privati che vendono i cuccioli spesso senza interessarsi più di tanto se la persona che compra possa essere adatta o no a quel tipo di razza. Se fossero più attenti e selezionassero maggiormente le persone gran parte del lavoro sarebbe fatto. E se selezionassero con maggior cura i cani da fare accoppi9are sarebbe ancora meglio. Un esempio: una mia amica ha comprato 4 anni fa un cucciolo di pitt bull maschio. Lei all'epoca aveva 19 anni. Per fortuna il cane è buonissimo e lei devo dire si è comportata bene con lui. Ma quanti ragazzini ci sono che sarebbero in grado di educare un cane così??? Infine basterebbe rendere obbligatorio un corso di educazione di base a tutti coloro che intendono acquistare queste razze, che NON SONO PERICOLOSE, ma che sicuramente necessitano di una educazione e socializzazione molto particolare.|`|Ub6wLDpNaa	io non so se il cane con la museruola soffre............. tu soffriresti se ti mettessero una museruola ?<br>  no, museruola no!!!!!<br>  ho capito che hai paura dei cani, ma se vedi un cane per strada non costringere il suo padrone a mettere la museruola al cane, pensa soltanto a cambiare il lato del marciapiede e non succederà niente.|`|a07786928cbf04adf65db5f28b26859aaa	Se sono pericolosi SI|`|b6c1d4e24f7a034e5b385874381651cfaa	Non esistono cani pericolosi, se diventano aggressivi la colpa è esclusivamente dei padroni che non hanno saputo educarli bene oppure li hanno istigati di proposito alla violenza. Inoltre, per un cane portare la museruola non è di certo come portare il collare o il guinzaglio, è una sofferenza  e basta, soprattutto durante il periodo estivo; per cui io non la metterò mai a un cane, però a certe persone più che volentieri, così almeno capiscono cosa si prova. Ciao!|`|eba06fc566fd78d63dc98d0a21978ac8aa	Partendo dal presupposto che non esistono cani pericolosi, ma solo cattivi padroni, esistono in realtà cani dal carattere più deciso rispetto ad altri, che sono quindi più impegnativi da educare.<br>  Comunque: i cosiddetti "cani pericolosi" sono sottoposti a normativa (tra l'altro l'elenco cambia in continuazione, io ho un dobermann, ed ora ne è fuori); tale normativa è consultabile su internet, ma comunque prevede che ci voglia l'assicurazione obbligatoria (una specie di R.C. cane...)e il guinzaglio o la museruola ( cambia di continuo però, quindi vai a vedere gli aggiornamenti).<br>  <br>  Se un cane è pericoloso o meno, però, non dipende dalla razza: io ci lavoro con i cani, e ti posso dire che ho preso mille morsi dai gatti e solo un paio dai cani, e uno solo dei cani era uno delle "razze pericolose"; e anche in quel caso è stata colpa mia, perchè gli ho causato dolore e non ho preso le debite precauzioni....<br>  <br>  Trovo che sia una STUPIDAGGINE, che è servita solo a "tenere buone" tutte le persone che dopo gli "eventi inspiegabili" di aggressioni canine erano sul piede di guerra.<br>  Ma vi siete mai chiesti come vi sentireste VOI legati a una catena tutto il giorno, cona acqua e cibo razionati, senza una coccola, senza un pò di amore? Senza avere la possibilità, richiesta da una animale "da branco" come il cane, di far parte di un gruppo? Anche io in quelle condizioni morderei la prima cosa che mi passa davanti.E come mai sono quasi tutti Rottweiler e Pastori tedeschi e Pitt-bull??Semplicemente perchè uno che vuole un cane da tenere legato alla catena non prende un beagle o un chihuahua.....<br>  <br>  Sono le pesone che andrebbero tenute con la museruola, per evitare che dicano troppe idiozie...............|`|004b5d61466197bbcce14e4f81c6872caa	I cani pericolosi esistono, o per lo meno più pericolosi di altri. E li abbiamo voluti noi così, noi uomini. Li abbiamo voluti cattivi, forti, mordaci, aggressivi e  per ottenerli abbiamo incrociato le razze con queste caratteristiche.

98cbabfe27423bbb32604382c4c71f1eaa	In der tat sind die meisten Schneckenh?user mit rechtsdrehenden Spiralen gezeichnet. Nur etwa 1 von 20.000 Schnecken haben eine linksdrehende Spirale. Diese Schnecken nennt man "Schneckenk?nige"!<br>  <br>  <br>  Als Schneckenk?nig bezeichnet man Schnecken, deren Haus in die andere, nicht arttypische Richtung gewunden ist.<br>  <br>  Die Windungsrichtung von Schneckenh?usern ist im allgemeinen definiert durch die Drehrichtung, die der Geh?usegang von innen nach au?en beschreibt, wenn man das Haus der Schnecke von der Seite aus betrachtet, auf der das innere (geschlossene) Ende des Schneckenganges liegt (Uhrzeigersinn = rechtsg?ngig). Am einfachsten betrachtet man dazu das Geh?use mit nach vorne zeigender Mündung und nach oben zeigender Schalenspitze (Apex). Befindet sich die Mündung nun rechts von der Schalenl?ngsachse, so handelt es sich um ein rechtsg?ngiges oder rechts gewundenes Geh?use.<br>  <br>  Weinbergschnecken haben normalerweise rechtsg?ngige H?user, die H?ufigkeit linksg?ngiger Weinbergschnecken wird auf etwa 1:10.000 bis 1:1.000.000 gesch?tzt. Bei solchen Tieren sind auch s?mtliche Organe (z. B. Herz, Atem- und Geschlechts?ffnung) seitenvertauscht.|`|89ea677ee58259eff0a9f5a8cf176be7aa	Es gibt in der Tat auch linksdrehende Schneckenh?user.

Ich erinnere mich nur, dass die linksdrehenden Schnecken einen Vorteil haben. Ich glaube, irgendein Fressfeind ist auf die Bauweise des rechtsdrehenden Hauses spezialisiert und hat mit dem linksdrehenden, wenn er das Haus festh?lt, Schwierigkeiten. Weshalb dieser Evolutionsvorteil sich aber noch nicht in gr??eren Zahlen von linksdrehenden H?usern niedergeschlagen hat, wei? ich auch nicht mehr richtig. Kann sein, dass sie bei den Fortpflanzungsbemühungen mit der Konstruktion der anders drehenden Schnecken nicht klar kommen.

6GGLffdraa	This sounds crazy but my friend suggested this and I tried it (cuz I have a constant shedder/dander-er as well) and it worked like a charm. Take a lint roller (like the circular sticky thing you would run over your clothes to remove lint) and roll it over your cat. My cat loves it! I mean, if it is hurting your cat or your cat has long hair, maybe try brushing but if you have a short or medium haired cat they don't seem to mind at all. Mine lays down and lets me do her whole body. Crazy cats but hey, it works!|`|2887544a9688b33e1ebb1a4e3397d4e9aa	I've never ever heard of anyone bathing a cat. Nor of giving a cat a haircut. Sounds pretty tortuous for the moggies. I've got a really good stiff comb-like brush which I use nearly every day when they're moulting. And they like it (but not everywhere). Well of course, the position of the air might have something to do with it... right, you're Americans... different cat practices UK and USA.|`|djHlBmH3aa	Try to brush them really good & then give them a bath with pet shampoo. They might not like it so it might take 2 of you to do it. That's what we did when they had alot of dander. It helped.|`|pLbRwbX8aa	Easy.<br>  <br>  You have to bathe your cats with pet shampoo.  This will help get rid of the excess hair and remove the dander.  When cats lick their fur, the saliva hardens and becomes a protective coat of dander.  Bathing them every month or so removes this.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Matt|`|h2DTaV4Raa	i would deffinitly suggest getting them shaved.<br>  i have a cat, and she gets whats called a teddy bear cut, <br>  which is getting shaved but a shorter hair cut, it seems to work brilliantly.

rGdfCGw3aa	Chihuaua's are great. Definately active and probably an excellent companion for you pom mix. I just got my 1st ever after owning strictly big dogs and I'm varying from having a ton of fun to pulling my hair out. But overall I wouldn't trade him for the world. He's SUPER adorable and always ready to play.<br>  Here's a link for more specific breed info: <br>  Hope this helps!! =)|`|Kh0utbR0aa	Chihuahuas have a beautiful temprement, very protective, very loyal and above all, very very cute!!! As all little dogs like to do, they think they are the boss sometimes and are a little bossy here and there but mostly, i cannot fault them. I have both a male and a female chihuahua, one short hair and one long hair, and they are beautiful with dogs, kids, cats and birds a like! - I would have to disagree with the post above me as i have 2 pugs, a GSD as well as the chihuahuas and they get on perfectly with other breeds... if they are brought up with bigger dogs, they interact perfectly with them! They have SOOO much energy and because theyre little you dont need to walk them as runnning around in the yard does the trick.|`|2d63894d5d03bc3e3ec3921e71eba0d7aa	We're doing that very thing right now. We have Max who is almost 14 and Faun who turned 2 and we are going to add another shortly and he's 11 weeks. I have silky terriers and love the breed. I'm lucky that our breeder and friend works with us. She brought the puppy over for a visit and it went really well. I wasn't sure it would because Max has lost most of his hearing and can get nippy. Next we will get the puppy for the weekend. If things go well then the puppy is ours. If you have a friend with a small dog ask them to visit and see how things go. Give the dogs time to get to know each other and sniff around and see what happens. Good luck to you and I hope things work out well.|`|AA11294969	I don't think they have a good temperment.

A reputable doggie daycare separates dogs out by size and temperment so that everyone has a safe play session. I would only have her go 2 or 3 times a week and watch her carefully for signs of stress. Some dogs thrive at daycare but others don't. Ask if you can observe a play session from a distance. She will act very differently if she can see you or smell you nearby. Some petsitters offer doggie playgroups as well.|`|C0aim4AMaa	my friend has a pomapoo and she plays great with my other's friend chihuahua. chihuahuas can be yappy and hyper and overprotective and only like it's owner, but they are fun but only get from a breeder because other wise the dog may have a really bad defect!|`|LwdNdSX4aa	I dont' think the breed of the dog should be the deciding factor, as they all have their certain 'tendacies'. If you like chihuahua's, then certainly get one. <br>  <br>  The main factor (I have 3 dogs and 1 cat) is each dog's personality. I believe you need to find a chihuahua that has a close personality to your pomeranian/poodle......which will be difficult, as you really don't know what the puppy's personality will evolve to when it grows up.|`|MFeF0iU4aa	I dont think a chihuahua is the best breed for your situation. They can be very fragile, especially if you have larger dogs. Also, chihuahuas "tend" to like their own breed and not other breeds, they can be more moody than other breeds also and may be injured by your pom. I would suggest you get another small breed that is similar to the size of your pomeranian/poodle. All dogs vary but please do extensive research on a breed before you buy to make sure the dog fits your lifestyle. =)|`|OU2DXft5aa	It'll be great for you to get a chihuahua, but it might be better to get a pompom :) But It's seriously your call, If you find a chihuahua that you love, then buy it!, but if you find a pomeranian that you love, buy that one.|`|XnXjWidJaa	the dog you might wanna get might night like other dogs. be sure you know if the new dog would be all right with all the new animals|`|b9f2c89b642ac9144add0b1b762daf90aa	be grateful for what you have|`|be6dce19da1f01683498b931581603c2aa	You should most definitely get a chi. i have 1 and they love to play. my chis name is max (Maxie) and he is really hyper. most chis I've seen are. but it depends on their personality 2 not all dogs re active though.just because it's a chi doesn't mean its going to be a fun loving dog though.|`|d7aPghceaa	that would be nice for your pomapoo...a chihuahua iguess would be okay...something as active as your pomapoo i would think too--i have a shorkie (shih-tzu and yorkie) nice little dogs very good tempermant and playful.|`|pJOSWsMsaa	i think you should not get that dog because you have a bird and other animals you can play with|`|uEO3eP3Eaa	Chihuahuas are really agressive.

Do you walk him at all and if you do how much.|`|213Tajn3aa	give him something nice to chew on|`|nGjMvGYqaa	There are a couple of different things you can try:<br>  The first thing is to increase his activity level. Some dogs bark out of boredom. If you exercise your dog more vigorously, perhaps he will not be so excitable. Another thing you can do to is to try to give him toys that will occupy his attention. I recommend Kongs. Put some peanut butter in it and let him go to town. Another toy that works wonderfully, is an Everlasting Treat Ball. It can keep dogs occupied for hours and hours. <br>  <br>  The next thing you can try is to see if something specific is exciting your dog, like perhaps neighbors or cars, and then do your best to eliminate that stimulus. <br>  <br>  If these suggestions do not work for you, I suggest calling your vet, and have a check up. Have your vet check him for overall health problems. If she cannot find anything wrong, you may want to check with a behavorist. Good luck!|`|m5KMqkY2aa	Spray bottle with water.

Too many dogs with horrible manners to enforce her shyness.  Maybe if your dog park has an area ONLY for small dogs, but otherwise avoid them.   Better to join an obedience class and have play dates with another dog from class that has nice manners.<br>  <br>  If she is shy around other people, take her lots of places with you but DO NOT force her to interact.  Let her take her time and hide behind you if she needs to.  DO NOT coddle her or make any fuss about her, just let her hang out near you, behind you, wherever she is comfortable.  <br>  <br>  A shy dog may never be "social" because it's just not its personality.  The best thing is to make sure their shyness doesn't turn to fear aggression by giving them new experiences that are not threatening.  Let your dog take her time coming out of her shell while you are out and about in town, at parks, etc.<br>  <br>  If you can help your dog to simply be "okay" with other people and dogs in the area that is really important.   What you don't want is her to feel constantly scared or stressed.  <br>  <br>  Finally, obedience training can increase confidence in a dog by giving it something to do that it can succeed at.  Consider signing up for training classes, tricks classes, and more advanced classes to build its confidence and trust and respect of you.|`|LZgTKxdwaa	Take her to obedient classes. She will get to be around other dogs and get training at the same time.<br>  <br>  Dog parks are another good way to socialize her. May take some time for her to warm up to other dogs...then again she may never. It just may be the way she is. I am not so freindly and making me go around even more people just makes me that much more unfriendly. Dogs are like people and they each have their own personality.|`|XwfZdXdFaa	you should get to be other dogs and people slowly it would want to be with other dogs thats how my dog was|`|iGz0VhNQaa	well before you introduce your dog to a crowd try bringing over one person at a time from time to time for him/her to get used to company. over time she/him should become less shy. just take it slowly

Stai tranquillo, nella mia esperienza con i pesci rossi ho notato che spesso crescono in modo "asimmetrico" nelle diverse fasi della loro vita: ciò è principalmente determinato da fattori genetici, è possibile che il tuo pesce fosse "destinato" dalla nascita a sviluppare una coda più lunga! Ad ogni modo se vuoi cercare di stimolare la crescita del tuo pesciolino in senso complessivo puoi acquistare nei negozi di acquariofilia specifici mangimi in pellet o granuli ricchi di vitamine e sostanze che stimolano la crescita del tuo pesciolino. Ti consiglio ad ogni modo di lasciar fare a madre natura che sa il fatto suo... buona fortuna!|`|cAE9hUyMaa	poco spazio|`|i84GfSU5aa	buh...è diventato adolescente :-)|`|pAoAjRSxaa	anke x i pesciolini rossi il tempo passa , di loro cresce solo la coda nn c'entra n'iente con il mangime|`|c4e7aa903fff003aa3241f81526e4813aa	Forse ha la coda di paglia

Mais pourtant, depuis que je suis petite, c'est toujours un émerveillement de voir des animaux de si près. <br>  <br>  Les zoos en général ont beaucoup évolués : si certains restent vétustes, avec de petits enclos et des cages inadaptées, beaucoup de zoos ont fait des efforts pour adapter au mieux les infrastructures aux besoins des animaux. <br>  En outre, les animaux sont souvent des enfants et petits enfants d'animaux qui ont toujours vécu en captivité, récupérés de cirques etc... les remettre en liberté n'aurait aucun sens, et ils ne sauraient pas survivre dans la nature. <br>  Enfin, comme tu le soulignais, certains zoos font de beaux efforts pour permettre la conservation d'espèces en danger, et parfois même leur réintroduction dans la nature.<br>  <br>  Mais un zoo ne vaut pas une belle réserve, où les animaux ont un territoire suffisamment grand, et où ce sont les humains qui restent dans leur voiture pour les observer...|`|Sm0PgVrVaa	E SUIS POUR D'UN COTE CAR ON A LA POSSIBILITE DE POUVOIR CONNAITRE ET VOIR DE PRES DES ANIMMAUX QUE L'ON AURAIT PAS EU L'OCCASION DE CONNAITRE,MAIS D'UN AUTRE COTE SA ME FAIT DE LA PEINE DE VOIR CES ANIMAUX ENFERME DANS DES CAGES ET QUI A MON AVIS NE DOIVENT PAS ETRE SI HEUREUX,MEME SI IL SON BIEN NOURRI ET CHOYER(dans certain zoo)je pense qu'il faut essayer de se mettre a la place de ses animaux et se demander comment on vivrer la captivite a leur place ,meme bien coyer et nourri,la LIBERTE pour tout etre vivant a une grande importance.|`|TiNaYSZhaa	c'est de la mer** en barre sauf pour les parcs naturels qui  font venir au monde des especes en voies de disparition  exposer des animaux au publique pour de l'argent c'est naze perso je prefere les voirs dans ma télé a l'état sauvage bien loin de cette humanité pourrie...|`|UKjMFP8haa	c'est bien bien mieux de faire des résèrves et parcs naturels pour protégér l'environnement|`|ZGXO0ZLGaa	Je n'aime pas aller dans les zoos, personnellement.<br>  <br>  J'ai toujours l'image de certains animaux, les yeux dans le vague.

Imaginez-vous : vous naissez dans une forêt, destiné à être un dominant dans votre petite tribu, et une bande d'humains vous enlèvent à votre vie et vous enferment.

J'ai trouvé cela super car dans ces conditions les animaux se reproduisent normalement et les espèces sont préservées. De plus, il y a un espace vétérinaire dans chaque zoo où des opérations se pratiquent sur place. J'ai été réconciliée avec la formule "zoo".

AA11633383	A litter box is best cleaned once a day.  You may be able to get by with less, but when a cat goes outside the box it is trying to tell you something.  In this case it sounds like she thinks the box is too dirty.  Try cleaning the box at least three times a week and see if that curtails the behavior.  |`|7qr2GprBaa	He's letting you know it's too dirty. <br>  <br>  You really need to clean it more than once a week. If you have one cat you could probably get away with every other day, or even twice a week. If you just don't have the time to do it more than once a week, get a second litter box and keep them right next to each other. He will most likely use both equally, but that should keep them both adequately clean for a full week's time before you have to clean them both out.|`|D02rAMWoaa	The litter box is probably dirty & needs cleaning.|`|AA10785667	Did you change litters? Sometimes the cat doesnt like the new brand of litter or there could be too many fragrances in it.<br>  Or you could use a bigger box. ( I think my cat needs a bigger box)<br>  Or the cat can have a urinary tract issue if its male.|`|L7ggNfGMaa	ok so a cats litter box needs to be cleaned more than once a week. cats are so sensitive to smells and feelings that you need to be careful. If your feline does exhibit some more types of behavior that aren't normal than you should take her to the vet.|`|WH0a9vSYaa	Get a bigger box. If the box is too small, she will stand on the edge and end up going on the floor.|`|CvCuJsjhaa	I would change the litter once a week and scoop the box every 1-2 days. She might also just be missing the side of the box, so I would recommend a covered litterbox that will allow her privacy.

wWDAWmBdaa	I traveled from California to Ontario Canada with 3 kids under 7 and 5 cats on my own. I drove. It's the best option. You can stop when you like and it's much less stressful for the dog. Your trip is probably less than half what mine was. It's easier to travel with a dog than cats too. With one dog and one child it will be a breeze.<br>  <br>  To fly them in the cabin not only do they have to fit under the seat, but most airlines say they ahve to be 12lbs or less.<br>  <br>  Edit: My kids actually loved it. I had a 2 year old a 4 year old and a 6 year old. We made it a huge adventure. The kids pretended we were on a wagon train. They loved every minute of it. i'm sure your child would too if you make it fun. It only took us 6 days so I'm sure if you wanted you could do your trip in 3 days. Now I drove long days, but if you make it fun it will be a trip you and your child will not only enjoy, but remember for a very long time.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I moved across the country and we chose to drive. After investigating all options and not feeling good about any of them we felt driving the dogs was the way to go.<br>  Putting the dog in the plane can be really risky. Talking with our vet we felt that was out of the question when he told us of injuries he has seen dogs end up with after being put in cargo. Burst eardrums, broken bones, heat stroke, hypothermia, trauma from not being secured in the plane correctly and being thrown around while the plane is in motion, etc.<br>  Trains do not allow animals and animal relocation companies that drive your pets for you are astronomically expensive. <br>  If you must fly, there are precautions you can take, like research which airline has the best record with flying animals, ask to watch your dog be loaded and unloaded, and alert the captain that there is live cargo and to climate control the cargo area. <br>  But if driving is at all an option, that is what I would do.|`|8xBlKPPWaa	drive!!!!!!! stop at hotels, make an adveture out of it. take lots of pictures, go swimming when you see a lake or beach front.  many places have attratctions stop off. the kid  will have a ball and the dog will be safe. yes it will take some time longer to git ta where ya goin but think of all the fun and memories, just take lots of pic's. also make up a cooler of food and drinks. and if all else fails (my 2 yr old would win out over the dog anyday)  ship him dogs are shiped everyday its not that big of a deal. best of luck|`|Cwqkbp49aa	If you don't want to drive, flying the dog in the cargo is not a bad option.  If you are worried about it being too hot, they sell electric fans that connect to the kennel front.  I flew my dog on the plane, and they took GREAT care of him...my brother said when he picked the dog up they had walked him and given him water!  The flight was about 4 hours long.|`|dWDmEyvTaa	You can fly your dog out there so long as his crate can fit under your airline seat. Airlines require your dog to be able to turn around in the crate and be small enough to fit under the seat. Jack Russels are pretty small if yours is normal wieght. You should totally be able to fit him under your seat in a crate.<br>  You can find regulation sizes of crates online for certain airlines. <br>  You'll also need a health care certificate from your vet within 10 days from your flight. Your pet has to be current on rabies vaccinations only but you should get the DA2PPC and Bordatella too. Some require fecal and heartworm tests as well. You can call the airlines to see what they require. For sure Rabies though!<br>  Good luck!!|`|rumjGcdPaa	you can send a dog by train but keep in mind they are still in a cargo compartment and will be in their crate the entire time. I would think you could do the drive on your own, better option for the dog.|`|7Azn0IJkaa	Hi there are companies that do pet transport.  They'll drive your dog to wherever you need them to be taken.<br>  <br>  I won't link to any of them b/c I have never used them nor do I know anyone who has used them, but I found several by just Googling "pet transport".<br>  <br>  You might ask your vet or something if they recommend a service like this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Qi3Cxomxaa	please please go to www.doglaw.hugpug.com<br>  they say don't put dog in cargo in any but a direct flite. ttragic consequences are noted there....i.e. death of 7 dogs etc...please go to that website. they talk about the liability issue too.. heating , etc. also, for those with pugs, etc reading this, pls note this notice from that site: <br>  SHORT NOSE? STAY ON THE GROUND<br>  When you fly, leave your Pekingese, bulldog, or pug at home. For these pug-nosed breeds, breathing - never easy - is just too difficult at high altitude. That's according to the Air Transport Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association. Some airlines don't accept dogs of these breeds if the temperature may be warm.
Jp0EHMplaa	We were feeding our puppy (black lab) 3 times a day at first, but when he was about 12 weeks old we fed him twice a day.  <br>  <br>  One problem he had until he was about 5 months old was he would vomit really early in the morning, like 4:00 or 5:00 AM.  Of course, his stomach was empty because he hadn't eaten since the night before, so it was really just bile and stomach acids.  Our vet said his stomach may have been upset because he went so long without food because his body processed the food so quickly that there was nothing in his tummy to absorb all the acids.  We would give him a tiny amount of food or a biscuit when this happened to calm his stomach.|`|Pheu2e1Qaa	2  TIMES A DAY ONE IN THE MORNING AND ONE AT NIGH|`|Pn9AA9vjaa	4 times a day|`|dnUvfn4jaa	You should be capable of feeding your puppy after his naps, in the morning, afternoon, and the evening...just remember, after every activity with your puppy, he should be going outside for a bit to do his buissness.... but yeah...sometimes he'll let you know when he's hungry...<br>  <br>  best of luck to you!<br>  <br>  x.tammi.x|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	at least 3 times a day.

Dv9o6ZSzaa	HI my friend.<br>  For sure now your dog can't learn where he should poo!<br>  He is very young. but from two or three weeks from now you can teach him.(you can use a news paper with and placing some soil on it and place these where you want him to poo and force him to do his work on it. and use another news paper in your hand and when he poo where that you don't want punish him(don't contact the news paper to him. just make a noise through it) .with a little patient you will succeed. after a while he will poo where he learn without news paper and soil.<br>  Also now you should take him to a vet.<br>  His crying is for his place or he is hungry.<br>  His place should not be a cold and dirty place now and should be SOFT. Use a basket and place pampers beneath it and change pampers periodically when get dirty. Also don't give him a cold milk otherwise he with get stomachache. use a milk powder which is lactose free like AL110 and make milk with adding water and make it about temperature of your body not hot!. You should feed him about every two hours but don't push him. After he ate his milk massage his stomach very slowly. You can feed him with a little ampul (just using the plastic section for sure!) or smallest child nipple to feed him slowly.

aCqSF87Raa	Why would you want to breed in the first place? Are the dogs healthy (proper breed specific tests done, no illness), do they have a good temperament, are they good examples of their breed, are they show dogs?<br>  <br>  Do you have thousands put away to spend on the mating, vet care, whelping, c-section if needed, post-whelping care, regular check ups for the pups and mom, shots for the pups?<br>  <br>  Can you house a lot of large breed puppies? Do you have time for them? Can you find them homes? Do you have contracts drawn up for owners that outline terms of sale and whether you can take pups that don't fit into their homes?<br>  <br>  There's more to it than throwing them together. If you were a breeder of any dog you would know this. Leave the breeding to the pros and get your dog(s) spayed/neutered.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	It is NOT ok! It would be like breeding 2 merles together. You could end up with blind or deaf pups. They could also be born without eyes. It's all luck and chance where the harlequin "spotting" will hit on the body.

qPslA7R6aa	Do not take him out until he's had his shots, he doesn't have to come into physical contact with another dog to pick up a disease.|`|6JQUIZFTaa	Has he had his series of puppy shots.? You do not want him in contact with other dogs until he has had the initial shots, as he could catch things.  Rabies shots are not given until they are older.  <br>  I had a sheltie and we walked her with a collar and with a halter.  She was fine both ways.  Shelties are quite smart and easily trained.  They love children and are great all around family pets.  Our Sheltie used to herd all of our son's friends when they came over to play.  When our daughter was a baby, our Sheltie appointed herself to be the baby's nanny.  She slept under her crib and the moment our baby cried,  our Sheltie came looking for one of us.  Our Sheltie was truly one of the best pets that we have ever owned.  She was so loyal.  You have made a nice choice.|`|WiHSBubdaa	Wait till you get all his shots. He can be taken out in the back yard to do his buisness but dont let him have any contact to other dogs and i adivie you wait. When a pupy is first lerning to walk get them a halter. Pupies tend to pull alot and it can choke or hurt them to have a regular collar. If you go to petsmart they will be glad to help you.|`|872g2wrTaa	Don't walk you dog outside until it has had its second set of vaccinations...they should have them around three months...six months and nine months. Rabies isn't the problem..it is parvo virus and distemper. Parvo is very very contagious and its only after the second shot that a dog begins to be immune...and they don't get immunity from their mums milk..<br>  <br>  keep your dog inside and walk him in your yard until he has had his second shots. Parvo is a killer.|`|sI58cE4maa	I would recomend a sensation harness also called an easy walk harness. It would help to teach him good leash walking skills right away. As for rabies just don't let him run free where he might come in contact with wild animals. There have been no cases of dogs giving dogs rabies in the US for a very long time.|`|ve01wlCaaa	I dont think it matters what collar you use. The one that goes around the dog's chest is designed to give you some more controll over the dog. I dont think you have to worrie about the rabies if you are taking your dog out for one walk around the block, but do try to get it vaccinated as soon as you can. Good luck!|`|ABtvW2APaa	If he has a distemper shot, it is ok to walk him.  I would get a harness (the vest one), or a gentle leader, which is a lead that goes around his mouth.  The harness provides no neck strain and prevents pulling a little bit.  The gentle leader prevents most pulling, but some people like to wait until puppies are fully leash-trained to use that.|`|IUUtQsfeaa	I don't think rabies is your biggest worry here, like many others Parvo is the one you have to watch out for. If your pup comes into contact with other dogs feces that is infected with parvo, your pup can get it and trust me it does not take long for Parvo to hit hard. <br>  <br>  After you get those shots feel free, but for now maybe stick to the yard.|`|LY5uznMSaa	I have always been told DO NOT take a pup out until they have all shots! Think about what COULD happen. That would be terrible. <br>  BUT i have two shelties one i have raised and the other i adopted at 1. I waited and took Roxi out after she had her shots, but before that i took her in the car to places and made sure she was exposed to lots of noises and new sights. I also took her to meet other dogs that I knew did not have diseases. Shelties are very timid if they are not worked with. I am sure you know this though. <br>  <br>  The best luck i have had with collars is: <br>  Roxi is dominate and likes to lead they way. I had to get on of those snap collars  (martingale collar made of all nylon, the chain is too much for such a little dog)for her. Its not a chocker, and its not a regular collar. I used it on her when she was about 11-12 month tough. I don’t think you would have much success with using it on a puppy.<br>  If you pup is nervous you night want to get a harness, this way if she become scared you can control her and protect her. But your pup is only three months old....i would really just wait to take her out. Walk her around your back yard (with a normal collar) and let her get used to the collar and leash. <br>  <br>  That was a lot of talking…and I really did not even answer your question!<br>  Hope some of it helped<br>  Ashley|`|dZfj0S6gaa	Get him used to a harness.I had a mix that did not take to a collar,but no problem with the harness.If you do take him outside,be sure that he doesn't get around other dogs.Keep him on a short leash.I prefer a 'tape type 'because if your finger should get wrapped around a cord leash  and the puppy should bolt, you will get a nasty burn or worse.Have fun with the pup.|`|m58afopCaa	I would wait until you get his rabies shot (16 weeks or 4 months old). It's more for liability reasons than anything else. If your dog bites someone and doesn't have its rabies shot, you'll be in deep you-know-what. You can be sued. <br>  <br>  .... And don't say, "But my dog would NEVER bite anyone!" I've got scars from clients who've said exactly that. You never know what you're dog will do under stress or when it's trying to protect you.<br>  <br>  Also, wait a week after the shot has been given. It takes that long to kick in.<br>  <br>  Collars... it's up to you! Either works, but dogs have a tendency to pull more with halters/vests than they do with collars. When your pup gets big, you REALLY won't want that. :)|`|qvTye973aa	You might be able to, but remember, it's not just other dogs you have to worry about.  Cats, bats, racoons, skunks and lots of other animals can get rabies, too.  If he'll stay with you and you can be sure he won't be exposed, it should be okay.|`|u59wJoWyaa	Yes you can walk him without rabies shots...they don't even usually give that shot until what 6months??<br>  The type of collar depends on how much control you have over the dog at this stage. Bigger dogs usually do better with the chain collars that tighten if they try to run.|`|zituIhQ2aa	he will be fine...unless you are worried he will be attacked by a bat or something.....also he is about old enough for his rabies shots...

You have a child that is prone to aggression and what better object to direct the child anger at then a puppy!  I would be remiss to tell you to get either dog breed.  Your child needs your full attention and until you have that under control than NO dog should be brought into your home!<br>  <br>  Also I don't know where you got that information about Golden's from but it is far from the truth and accurate portrial of a very well bred and quality Golden.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	A golden ret.  would be best because border collie needs a job to do.       I would get a older golden than a puppy.      I would make sure that it is kid friendly.  You  might need to wait till the kid is a little older or you can stop him from hitting and throwing.|`|6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa	If your child is a "hitter and a thrower", no offense, but maybe you should get him under control first, before you get a dog.  If you don't want to teach your child to stop hitting, or throwing things, whatever, but you WILL need to teach the child that he can not behave that way around animals.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	I wouldn't get either dog right now.  Your 3-year-old needs some discipline to teach him how to stop hitting and throwing things before you should get a dog, or the child is likely to find himself on the recieving end of a dog bite.<br>  <br>  The golden retriever is a much more mellow dog than the border collie, and if you already have a hyper child, you don't need a hyper dog as well.  <br>  <br>  It's not likely the dog will consider you its favorite owner unless you can protect it from your child's hitting and throwing behavior.  It is far more lilkely that the dog will become aggressive towards people and towards other dogs.<br>  <br>  I wish I could hold out a more positive answer for you, but with an out of control 3-year-old, bringing a dog into the house is just asking for trouble.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, good luck!|`|NbgxNAYZaa	I think if it was me I'd go with the retriever.

High praise when he does his job outside.<br>  <br>  NO corrections, discipline or punishment after the fact. If you find a puddle or package - that was your fault not his.

The initial cost is the most as it includes the dog, puppy shots, neuter, and all the little things like leashes and dog beds.  <br>  <br>  You can be thrifty and get a nice dog bed at Walmart for $30 or pay $100 for one which is fancier. <br>  <br>  Also, it will depend on your breed.  I have small dogs and they cost me $100 a month per dog.  $80 for food and training and an extra $20 for the average of vet bills and meds that I don't pay monthly but do need to pay yearly. <br>  <br>  I feed raw or cooked meals (not kibble) and I train them every month since I think continued training is imperative.  I think it would cost about $30 a month if I skimped on food and training. <br>  <br>  Before getting a dog, I'd go thru store isles and catalogs, call up some vets and training places and write down all the costs.

Especially if you get a dog with an unknown background (potential health problems can occur).  <br>  Its hard to give an exact number, but in the first year it will be a bit more expensive because you need to pay for there first 3 vaccinations start at 8-10 weeks old and end at 16-18 weeks, then you need to pay for rabies vaccination at about 6 months old, need to buy brushes, bedding, toys, crate, leashes, collar, spay/ neuter (anywhere from $200-380), they need their nails clipped once a month (about $15 for that), food (good quality food is about $50-70 a bag), you need to make sure they have monthly dose to protect them from fleas/ heartworm/ ticks....<br>  <br>  For me and my 14 week old Pomeranian we pay about $140 a month for food and vet bills (she still gets one more vaccine, and gets nails clipped once a month). After that at 6 months I will have to pay for her rabies vaccine and spay- $380 for that. After all her puppy stuff is taken care of I will be paying about $80 a month on food/ grooming/ toys.<br>  <br>  It all adds up fairly quickly.

The first year is often very expensive-the price of the dog + $1000-$2000.  After that, I have spent between $1500-$5000 a year on my 4 dogs.  I'd be prepared to budget $200 a month for a dog, and have access to a good amount of credit or savings for emergencies ($2000 minimum, $5000 is smarter).  <br>  <br>  If you travel often, you have to consider boarding fees, as well.  I usually have a friend that I trade sitting with, but last week, she was unavailable, and I paid $397 for boarding with the vet (5 days).  <br>  <br>  If you are a first-time owner getting a puppy, plan on that puppy destroying at LEAST $1500 worth of household goods before you figure out how to prevent it.

I'm often lucky because they are young, healthy and well bred right now to have money left over each year. I also have a Visa card with a large limit just for vet bills though if needed.<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb says the better the dog is bred and the younger it is the less you will spend. The older it gets or if you get a poorly bred animal the more it's going to cost. <br>  <br>  There is too much to take into account to be too specific, but I would rather allow more than I'm going to need than join the band who have very sick dogs and either struggle to take it to a vet or the poor animal dies because they say they can;t afford it.
eDySIDPQaa	Yes, I have one, his name is Bo, jet black and weighs in at 163 lbs..<br>  <br>  he is gorgeous,,,and he needs combing and brushing every other day to keep the coat in excellent condition, we are currently in the process of continuing to show him...he has taken 4 best in shows, and is winning alot...my son had him on the show trail before he passed away and we are gonna continue with him.<br>  <br>  he is a big ole baby and loves to sleep with us,he lays longways with his feet on my back or on my shoulders, the oversize king size bed we have is full right now, it is storming here and Bo, Newfoundland, Demon, my Min.Schnauzer and Koda my male Akita are all on top of the bed together asleep.<br>  <br>  and at night, it is a battle to get room and settled before the dogs hit the bed.<br>  <br>  Breeder/show/handler 15 yrs<br>  <br>  and not all Newfies hump humans.........I have never seen one yet that does and Bo never has...and never did with my son or his wife....|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Yea but they are hairy so they need to be brushed and groomed at least no less than 3 times a week|`|cETQuE9waa	No not really.

You need to make sure they are fed giant breed dog food and have joint supplements. Due to their size they are prone to hip/joint issues as well as other health problems. Make sure you have the space too for them to run and get exercise.
JtYNXoRdaa	It doesn't really sound like she is an aggressive dog and the only thing I would be worried about is possibly small children that could get to her and surprise her.  It's always best, with a sleeping dog, to shuffle your feet or walk a bit more loudly than you would or make a noise so they know you're coming.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, with smaller dogs, they simply don't want to be picked up at that moment.  It's a warning.  My small Shiba Inu does the same thing occasionally.  Though, since we have had other issues with her trying to be "alpha dog", she gets laid out pretty quickly for any kind of behavior like that.  Is your pup normally okay with being handled?  If so, I wouldn't worry that there is a medical problem that may be causing her discomfort or anything, just that she's saying, "I'm sleeping, go away." <br>  <br>  And I'm still trying to figure out what's okay.  Is it okay for them to growl at that point if they never show signs of aggression anywhere else?  Just a small, "Hey...leave me alone right now." Or do you get over them and say, "Listen here, you little punk, this is MY palace, I AM top dog and if I WANT to pick you up I will." (Ha...not literally those words, but getting them to understand that they are not above you).  Like I said, my Shiba gets the latter treatment, but because she has other dominance issues.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped...no, I don't think this is necessarily anything to worry about, but definitely something to keep an eye on and decide how you want to handle it as the leader...because you ARE the leader, right?  ;-)|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	You probably surprised her.  Look up some sites that deal with that and see what advise looks best to you.  I'm sure you surprised the dog when it was comfortable under the covers.  You can help dogs with aggression.  It was probably the former owners that instilled the aggression.  Good luck!|`|zJuX49PYaa	Id make sure shes not in a ny pain! bring her to the vet and have her checked out. <br>  <br>  Dogs will bite there favorite owner if they are in pain!|`|vUMJKJDbaa	Dogs do have mood swings but that is probably not it. When dogs (and humans) fall asleep, your eyes start to close and you start dreaming like you are half asleep and half awake and so do dogs. They can get startled just like us and want to protect themselves. My dog does that too and thats why i try my best to not to startle my dog at any time. Even when dogs eat, they consintrate on only that and if you touch them, they can bite.|`|3FZhgqfNaa	She may be deaf (or partially deaf).... and you startled her.|`|20fqa5hCaa	She was probably asleep.  My girl sleeps at the end of the bed and sometimes if I startle her with my foot she growls.  Dogs are just like people.  Some of them don't wake up well if they are startled.  As long as she made no move to hurt you and this only happens when you are waking her up I wouldn't worry.  Just be aware when she's sleeping and don't allow strangers to go right up to her when she's sleeping.  With my dog it has never escalated to anything else and when she is awake she would never thinking of growling at me except in play.  As for the play biting, you need to decide whether that is okay.  Many people feel that it is not allowable.  My dogs don't do it, so I've never given it much thought.  But it is not aggression on her part.|`|tV9Q1P1gaa	maby your dog was asleep and you scared her. but if your really woried call a vet. hope everything works out
91CX5jHaaa	They are a good choice for kids and other dogs.  They ae very social and accepting of other dogs.  Big question is are you aware they can be very barky, especially at play?  You can adopt a great sheltie from rescue for around $200, and it will be already neutered and vaccinated.  If you choose to go to a breeder, make SURE it is a responsible one.  Ask the breeder if the parents are tested for VWD, Are OFA'd and CERF'd, and thyroid tested.  If the breeder doesnt SHOW you the results of the testing, or says they don't do, or need the tests, RUN AWAY.  If you'd like, I can help you find responsible breeders and rescues in your area.  Or you can research it yourself at www.assa.org.  Good luck!|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	Shelties are very neat dog to own.  I have had 6 over the last 35 years.        As long as you are willing to take the dog to take the puppy to Obedience class and also  Agility if you want.     They are not a dog that you can just put in the back yard and not do anything with.      Please get on the akc.org site and find out more about the breed.      You can e-mail me if you want to I will talk to you more than i can here.|`|q6rrpwhhaa	They are great dogs.I think it would be ideal they have a great tempermant and are amazingly loyal.They grow to aroud 13 - 16 inches and usally weigh 10-40 pounds.When you have it out stay in control as they have the instinct to herd and chase things.This gives them energy so be prepared to walk it 3 - 5 walks that last 20 mins each time  :) They also have a high level of intelagence.<br>  Shelties also can have problems with their eyes.Not to worry , just go to vet for check ups and he/she should be fine.Oh and remember to brush it aswell becuase of there thick fur they will have to brushed daily:)<br>  Hope it helped and good luck :D|`|e004478162280785c599c6d3f8057085aa	Sounds great!  Do you have a fenced in back yard?  That would be great for them to run around together
z4ktz1h9aa	It is fine to crate your dog while no one is there.  It protects him, and your belongings.  Your dog only needs one or two meals a day, a 5 hour span of not eating is perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  For a dog bed, you can just use some old blankets or towels.  No need to go out and spend money on one.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well he doesn't need to sleep in a kennel when no one is home, if he has been trained to behave in the house.  I leave food and water out for my dogs, they decide when to eat or drink it.  I am not sure what you mean by a 5 hour span when no one is home.  If your dog is a puppy, they have limits as to how long they can be left alone.  It is usually 1 hour for each month of age, plus one hour, so a three-month-old puppy can only be left alone for 4 hours at the most.  If it is a dog, than I don't think 5 hours is long.  Some times my dogs sleep in a bed, and sometimes they just sleep where they want to.  They have an assortment of old pillows and doggie pillows and all kinds of blankets here and there to sleep on, but sometimes they just sleep on the floor.  Dogs are funny sometimes.|`|Cwqkbp49aa	Depends on age, for some of your questions.<br>  <br>  Pups generally need guidelines, so a fenced in area or kennel is good for them.  Dogs genereally see a kennel as their home and "safe haven", so it really isn't a bad thing.  Maybe try to leave some dog toys in the kennel with him.  I have one dog that has to be restricted to a certain area, he can't be trusted when nobody is home!  I have another dog who is able to roam free all the time, because he never destroys anything.  Each dog is different.<br>  <br>  I prefer to feed twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.  Never after 8pm (no water after 8pm either, if they are still a pup).  But each owner prefers to do this differently; do what is good for your lifestyle and schedule.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you could use a pillow or blanket; you don't need to buy a dog bed.  Anything soft for them to lay on is comforting, especially if your scent (like a old t-shirt you've worn) is on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|41fbace3a35d7b3b723b169b135d2511aa	My dog is her kennel approximately 8 hours a day while we are at work. I do not leave food or water in there for the mere fact that I think it's cruel to let her eat or drink, but not use the bathroom. She eats every 12 hours. Once in the morning before going in the crate and again in the evening. She also sleeps all night in her kennel. Dogs don't think of kennels like we do. She loves hers and can sometimes even be found napping in there with the door wide open on weekends when we're home.<br>  <br>  As for a bed: You can use an old blanket folded up or an old pillow. My puppy has an old pillow and pillowcase. She chews everything so this way I'm not wasting any money.  Surprisingly, she hasn't torn up this one.|`|4SuyVDFvaa	if he's house trained and doesn't chew things or destroy the house, let him be loose.  we leave our shar-pei loose all day.  we just close every room except the bedroom (he likes to sleep on the bed!), open the curtain so he can sit in the chair and look out the window, turn the tv on and he is good.  if you want just a soft bed, you can get an old comforter, fold it in half, sew up 2 sides, put buttons or zipper on the other side, and fill it with cedar chips.  For a wooden bed, get an old drawer that is big enough for the dog and do the comforter thing inside it|`|gLJBnqYmaa	We just used an old pillow with a blanket wrapped around it and fluffed it up. It's not necessary to buy a dog bed unless it's going to be fancy.|`|2WhG6rDAaa	Yes, he needs to be in his kennel when no one is home, or he won't be properly trained and you will regreat it. a 5 hour span is fine, mine are in crates for 8 hours while I'm at work. I would make sure he goes to bathroom before he goes in the crate.. and don't give him water while in there, or he might go inside.<br>  <br>  As for the dog bed, I strongly suggest purchasing one. You won't have the materials they use at the store, nor will it have the scent that they like.|`|xGRl6gY1aa	I would crate the dog while gone.  I think 5 hours is fine, and no water, but make sure the house is not to hot or to cold.  I would use old blankets and pillows.  If you have a small dog you could use an old dresser drawer, and put pillows and blankets or towels in it.  If it is a large dog you could bild a short bigger box and do the same.
MaUlbbCMaa	<br>  YOUR PET IS TRYING TELL YOU SOMETHING!<br>  <br>  I have had cats and dogs for the past 40 plus years’ changes in behavior especially potty changes usually mean a health problem. Cats will associate any bladder or bowel pain they feel while using the litter box to the litter box so they stop using it. I had to learn the hard way when cats are peeing and pooping outside of their litter box then they are definitely telling you something is going on. It’s best to check that first before you move to anything else. <br>  <br>  In the past pets of mine had a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and one had diabetes and stopped using the litter box, one of my other kitties had inflammatory bowel disease and she stopped using the box for bowel movements. My other cat would come into the bathroom and pee in the shower or jump in the tub and pee. They are trying to tell you something when this happens. Bring your pet to the VET for a well kitty/dog check up, my kitty had a UTI from high sugar in her urine and diabetes as you can see many reasons. One of my dogs who was house trained started peeing on the floor I scolded her wrongly as I found out next day I saw blood in her urine. She was in pain and either couldn’t hold it or trying to tell me something too.  Have her checked out soon as you can.

Is he indoor only? how long have you had him? how long have the problems been going on? ... unless you have caught him in the act dont be so sure it is him causing the problems... sometimes it's the kitty's you dont suspect that is causing the issue.... how old is the kitty?  also i would try confining him to one area if possible like a bathroom , remove the bath rugs if their in their so he cant ruin them....also if this just suddenly started happening.. and everything seemed fine before... then he should get a vet check up... also I would say did anything happen in the house at the time of his issues, like , a new pet? someone move out? move in? loss of another pet? anything out of the ordinary, also re-modeling in the house? new cat food? new litter get used?    anything.. it could be related to that... also you can try this litter from petsmart of petco called 'CAT ATTRACT'  works great, but make sure to follow the instructions on the bag. well that's really the first place to start.... trying to see what going on and if you confine then you can make sure it is him causing the issues, also the sooner the better, cats tend to be creatures of habit and the longer they are alloweed to do something the harder it is to break... best of luck.... |`|AA10906018	Isolate Lazlo in your room....AFTER you have him get a check up from the vet.

25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	I think that you should wait a little longer to get another one. Wait and see how the first dog acts. If he acts good, then buy another dog.

The reason why i say this; is when you are trying to train the both of them...it will be hard to get their attention together...they will not take you seriously and go about their own ways together. Rite now, having only the one dog, he see's you as his leader. I would get this one fully trained first, and then think about the second puppy! Hope this helps!|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	There is nothing wrong with you getting a second dog if you feel that you have the time for a second one and can afford it. Since your current dog is only 5months old I personnel would wait until that puppy is at least 9months to 1 year. This way your current dog will be mostly trained by the time you add another one to your pack.

You got ripped off once, please do not make the mistake twice.|`|uTIgyCCHaa	No good breeder would tell you that "everything will be fine."  In fact, breeders usually advise AGAINST raising 2 puppies at the same time.  The best time to get a second puppy is AFTER the first is 2 yrs old.  That way you've had plenty of time to train it, bond with it, and get past the "puppy stage."  So many people get 2 puppies thinking that it would be so much fun to watch them play, or they think that a 2nd dog will keep the first busy and out of trouble -- not true!  If you want both dogs to be well-trained and loyal to YOU, you must train them separately and spend quality time with them separately.  Think of your pup's attention span -- it's nearly impossible to train two puppies at the same time, walk two puppies at the same time, or even get them to acknowledge you when they're together.  Not only that, but there is a great risk of them developing severe separation anxiety when they're apart if they are together for most of their puppyhood.  They can become anti-social or aggressive around other dogs.<br>  <br>  Two puppies is LITERALLY twice the work.  If you don't have that kind of time, you should wait.  There's something called "littermate syndrome" that you risk when you get two puppies.  They don't necessarily have to be littermates to get the "syndrome," but the younger and closer in age the two are, the more likely you will have problems.  It is possible to raise two well-rounded pups, but it's a whole lot of work.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doglistener.co.uk/choosing/siblings.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.doglistener.co.uk/choosing/si...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.topdogclub.com/training/Buying-More-Than-One-Puppy-Should-You.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.topdogclub.com/training/Buyin...</a><br>  <br>  |`|7ciDto6Daa	Well of course the breeder said everything will be okay.<br>  Because there trying to rip you off.<br>  No responsible breeder would breed two different dogs.<br>  Please dont buy, There trying to scam you.|`|d8a4772185e73e1a17e8fdc35620b47faa	As long as you have enough time and money for them go for it.

AA11736483	You should never bathe cats unless it has gotten into something really bad. Kittens you should be especially cautious because they cannot regulate their temperature well. Baths strip off the natural oils from a cat. These oils help protect them. Scents also play a very important role in cats and a bath will remove the cats unique smell. Besides, cats hate water.|`|7MU2IK7Iaa	Cats are averse to water and bathing is torture to them.<br>  A healthy cat cleans herself - an unhealthy one should go to the vet, not into a bathtub!|`|nAK8bm91aa	ok, first don't give her whole milk anymore, give her 2 percent to loose the weight. Now you can give her a bath using warm water only and towel her immediately and completely dry. She may however scratch you so be careful, cats DO NOT LIKE WATER BATH'S, This is why they constantly clean themselves naturally.|`|sfVyVt6Eaa	Well cats don't usually need baths, but if you just like putting a cat in a tub with water lol, then start about now. I tried to give my cat a bath once...the results weren't good mainly because my cat isn't used to the water.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Does she need a bath?  Usually cats clean themselves.  At 4 weeks, her mom should be cleaning her for you.|`|sVf68yC8aa	YA DUNT NEED TA WASH A CAT<br>  <br>  BUT IOF YA DO..........<br>  <br>  DOSE WITH VALIUM FURST|`|2Mug8KaBaa	I got my kitten when she was 5 weeks old, and I gave her a bath right away.  You just have to use something REALLY gentle, no flea shampoo quite yet.  I used Dawn dish soap because it's really gentle and I remembered seeing people use it on wildlife during an oil spill, so I knew it was okay for animals! Anyway, good luck with your new kitten!!|`|25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	Only wash her if shes dirty. Don't wash her on purpose. That's my opinion. I think you should wash her with your hands just to be safe.|`|SwsT8Nmgaa	if its an inside cat every two monthes but for an outside cat every month!|`|3CWHp1PJaa	Don't do dat. Lol! Don't!|`|eBtxuJ0maa	No dairy milk.
krZx8FRhaa	take her out on a leash only to go potty, do not let her "play" outside, until she learns outside is the ONLY acceptable place to potty. Once she stops going in the house, then you can allow her to go outside. If she is going in the house, you either aren't reading her signal on when she needs to go out or you're not taking her out enough. Feed her on a schedule. Do not leave food out all the time. That way, you know when she eats, and you know in 10-15 minutes, she'll need to go out. Even feed her water on a schedule. Also, grab a piece of food before taking her out to potty, as soon as she goes, give lots of praise, and give her the food EVERYTIME she goes out side.|`|s76aC4G8aa	yes, use a leash and do not permit her to run around until she's finished her business.  She's gotten it into her head that outside is for playing [not pottying] so she runs around and has a great time doesn't eliminate until she comes inside.  So you aren't waiting until she goes before bringing her inside.<br>  <br>  Outside is ON LEASH taken to a spot in the yard you walk around and say potty time, when she potties you say good potty and give her a treat, then you try for poops.  Be consistent, be patient and be clear in your training.  go out the same door each time, say lets go potty as you leash her up, say go potty while walking her around and don't forget to praise and treat when she goes.<br>  <br>  If she has an accident in the house smack yourself for not being diligent enough, ignore the dog and clean it up.  Yelling and rubbing their nose in it will set your training back to ZERO.  You will make her afraid to eliminate so she'll hide it from you because she'll see elimination as a scary and dangerous thing to do around you and you don't want that, pottying should be happy and stress free.<br>  <br>  Make sure you get her out every 2 hours to pee, set a timer if you must to remind yourself, soon she will equate the sound of the bell with pottying and she might beat you to the door to go out.<br>  <br>  Be patient and be consistent and most of all NO PUNISHING, YELLING HITTING OR RUBBING THEIR NOSE IN IT.  All you'll do is reinforce the bad behavior by paying attention to it which will make them do it more.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|dRCWdKBEaa	take her to a training class, it doesn't matter how late you do it, it still works.|`|25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	Well then buy a leash. You can also use voice commands. Use them for two or three weeks, and I'm sure your puppy will learn to obey you a little more. Hope I helped. Good Luck!!!

Otherwise, you will be putting her into the ground.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Why do you own a dog if you can not properly take care of her? What happened if she got hit by a car and is in serious pain?

Get off the computer and to the vet now before you are thought to be a neglectful pet owner!|`|GLsCVPCuaa	u HAVE to|`|UEHsqSaTaa	POOR THING! Take her to the vet. Your dog may have a itchy ear and could be scratching.I got the limping leg off the internet. <br>  <br>  <br>  Paws:<br>  The first thing I do is examine the pet’s paw for thorns and stickers. Grass sand spurs caught between the pads of the foot are a very common cause of limping. Once the thorn is removed the wound rarely becomes infected. Thorns are more of a problem in dogs whose toe pads are heavily furred.<br>  <br>  Paw Lacerations are also quite common. These are often due to treading on sharp glass fragments. Even large lacerations heal quite well without suturing. I usually recommend that cut footpads be soaked four times a day in warm hydrogen peroxide solution or tame iodine solution (Betadine, Wescodine, Povidine). Bandages tend to trap unwanted moisture and debris in the wound. <br>  <br>  Overgrown or overly short toenails can cause limping. This is particularly a problem in older, less active pets. These nails often break off exposing the quick of the nail. These nails quickly become infected. In other cases, overgrown toenails twist the joints of the toes causing toe arthritis. And painful toe joints. These nails need to be clipped off short under a mild anesthetic. Antibiotics are rarely required. Very active dogs and dogs housed on concrete often wear their toenails down to the quick. With time, the quick on these nails recede and pain subsides.<br>  <br>  Elbows:<br>  Unstable elbow joints of dogs and cats are subject to arthritis. The most common causes are elbow dysplasia where fragments of bone (medial coronoid process) are present in the elbow joint and ununited anconeal process where a portion of one of the bones that forms the elbow fails to fuse. These conditions tend to affect large breeds of dogs such as Labrador and Golden retrievers and Rottweilers. Signs often first appear at 5-7 months of age with a limp that worsens after exercise. These dogs are stiff in the morning or after rest. Both elbows can be affected. The elbow may be puffy. These conditions can be treated medically with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines for a number of years or immediate attempts can be made to repair the joints surgically. Neither problem corrects itself and some degree of arthritis of these joints usually develops regardless of the treatment used. Dogs with this problem should be kept lean and given joint-enhancing glucosamine and chondrotin supplements.|`|AA10210947	limping and bleeding from the ears are not related.  The bleeding from the ears is probably due to a serious ear infection that needs antibiotics and ear medication to remedy the problem.   The limping could be numerous things. Without being seen by a vet there is no way to diagnose this problem|`|mnufOa6eaa	Your dog needs to go to the vet now! If she is bleeding from the ears, limping, and getting worse every day, I'd say that's a major sign to get her to the vet!<br>  <br>  Would you like someone to leave you like that? She's in pain.|`|XgqwQ7szaa	You have to take her to the vet. You can always earn and work the money back but your dog is most likely going to die if you don't take action now.|`|AA10532902	she may have been hit by a car, and the bleeding from the ears is a bad sign, my vote is to take her to the vet- or wait to see if she gets better|`|d5KW3h0Iaa	it could be old age or maybe she got hit by a car and has internal bleeding the best thing really to do is take her to a vet|`|WPYRSSlQaa	it might be related if she is stumbling around as in loosing her balance<br>  but take her tro the vet|`|AcxGrmnuaa	doughboy SHUT UP and get your lazy butt off this computer. <br>  I think she heard a loud noise, or she might be sick.

Thousands of people in the U.S. become infected with roundworms and hookworms every year. <br>  Humans become infected with roundworms when they ingest infective eggs from the soil or from their hands or another object. Large numbers of the eggs can accumulate in the soil where dogs and cats are allowed to defecate. The eggs are sticky, and can collect on the hands and under the fingernails of people. Children, and others who may not have good hygiene, are most prone to becoming infected.<br>  <br>  People become infected with hookworms when the hookworm larvae in the ground penetrate through the skin. Persons who have contact with the ground, especially for long periods of time, such as plumbers or electricians, and sunbathers, especially those lying on wet sand or ground, are at increased risk.<br>  <br>  Roundworm eggs and hookworms eggs and larvae need to be in the environment approximately two weeks, before becoming infective, so direct contact with an infected animal generally does not result in transmission. However, young puppies may continually contaminate their entire litter area. Adults and children who handle the ***** or puppies or who clean the area may be especially at risk.<br>  <br>  If a human ingests roundworm eggs, the subsequent larvae can migrate through the person's tissues (this condition is called "visceral larva migrans") or eye ("ocular larva migrans"). Hookworm larvae migrate through the skin and cause a disease known as "cutaneous larval migrans."<br>  <br>  To prevent human infection, good hygiene is extremely important. Teach children, especially, to wash their hands after playing and before eating. Do not let children play in areas where dogs or cats may have defecated. Do not allow cats to use sandboxes or the garden as litter boxes. Worm your pets as recommended, keep the environment clean, and control rodent populations.|`|HgBvRwjraa	Yes you can get worms, but it is not easy.

Good luck! :)|`|553dd522bbfdb5683aa63a9643bd3ae8aa	Poms have tiny stomachs so you are probably filling her up with the treats. Have you tried the new doggy sauces that are on the market? These you pour on her food to flavor it up and are healthier than table scraps. Good luck.|`|da8b0f2f8459558e4fcbaba67fe77cf6aa	Small dog snack are made with high amounts of sugar.  Dogs can smell the sweetness of them.  Companies make treats extra sweet so it seems like your dog really likes them, but they are really just getting hyped up on sugar.  I'd try to slowly ween her off of them.  If you take them away right away, she will not eat anything.  Cut down the amounts of treats you give to her a day until you practically never give them.  Certain can foods will have sugar levels that your dog may like.  Pedigree is made with high sugar levels, that's why it's such a light color.  As opposed to Alpo, which is much darker, made with a lot less sugar, and is actually a lot healthier for your dog.  But since you have a small dog you'll probably want to try the tinier can brands.  Read the labels to make sure there is not too much sugar.  Too much sugar will eventually cause an unhealthy heart, and shorter life span, not to mention messier poop.  It is also important to give kibble as well.  I find that dogs will eat kibble easier if you mix it with can food.  This is the healthiet way to feed a dog, and will keep it a lot happier when it comes to meal time.|`|fb77ec9826284e13d65123d0b56dae4caa	First thing is to stop giving all the treats.  Why eat food if your getting candy bars.  You may want to try adding a little can food or the frozen Bil Jac food.  But the canine carryouts is really  high in fat.  Its just wheat flour coated with fat so she is not getting enough nutrition.  Also, Iams and Vita Gravy is a gravy to put on dog food so that they eat it.  I don't know if you are buying Premium foods or grocery foods.  Usually premium doesnot taste good to dogs cause its not coated in fat.  So you may want to try a low grade food like Dog chow or pedigree or kibbles & bits  and mix it with a better food.  Another trick is to wet the dry dog food so that it is soft and smells better too. Or mix in a few itty bitty pieces of treats in to the food and each day lower the amount of treats in it.  The downer is changing foods to many times also makes dogs picky.

Most social animals such as dogs, cats and others who live in groups develop bonds with each other. Your pet does not see you as their owner, they see you as a member of their pack. In the wild you will see wolves and wild dogs interact and when it comes to allowing new members into their pack it is not taken lightly and is a rare occurance. Your dog may see other dogs or animals as intruders before they realize that they are new family members.  Just make sure that you let your dog know that you are the one who makes the decisions and not the other way around when it comes to allowing new animals into the house.|`|6eab440e2dad893ee04a7db563b09e12aa	possibly..awww give him lots of love!!|`|b0a3fa8a98cdc0ff30552cf483df1822aa	as he's a new family member, now is the time to accustom him to accepting new pets- whether they are yours or just visiting. i have a male chihuahua, who i am guilty of spoiling and 'mothering'. when he was 5 months old, he decided if i was holding him and anyone else tried to pet him or touch me (my boyfriend included) he would growl and sometimes snap at their fingers as if he was trying to protect me.

Conviene usare un sapone leggero o uno shampoo per cani, non vanno bene i saponi per umani, neanche se delicati, perché se per l’uomo il PH è leggermente acido e cioè 5.5 nei cani il PH è neutro e cioè 7 quindi utilizzando shampoo non appositamente studiati si rischia di provocare nel cane delle dermatiti e forse questo può essere il tuo caso.<br>  Detto questo, per averne la certezza, porta il tuo cane dal veterinario che ti saprà spiegare al meglio la situazione.<br>  Tutto si sistemerà, ma la prossima volta compra uno shampoo studiato appositamente per lui e, anche se ti costerà un po' di più, il tuo cane ne guadagnerà in salute!<br>  Ciao ciao.<br>  :o)|`|9d5uEo6Taa	Non spieghi bene che tipo di macchie sono... non credo piuttosto può dipendere da qualche infezione|`|3t2TLHcJaa	non vorrei demoralizzarti, ma da quello che posso aver intuito...è una bella micosi...portalo dal veterinario..|`|jgKReznxaa	Gli animali vanno lavati solo con gli appositi saponi adatti a loro!

70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	She's been through some very serious physical stress,and it will take some time for her to recover,but she should recover completely.Just let her sleep,make sure she eats regular meals ( feed a high quality puppy food.) I would give her some plain yogurt everyday ( not fat free,not artificially sweetened),and ask your vet about adding a puppy vitamin to her food.I've had dogs with parvo,but they were vaccinated adults,and got over it in a week.It's a lot harder on a puppy.Just give her time,and she should be OK.|`|46181f764bb037eb34818a9404702b95aa	I would have your vet do a full check up on your dog.  You don't mention the circumstances on catching parvo, but there's a chance she's caught something else as well.  You probably won't get a positive on her yet, as young as she is, but she could aslo have a case of heartworms started.  <br>  <br>  I do rescue, and nursed a litter of 4 Border Collie pups who caught parvo at the pound we rescued them from (it was a pound- nothing more).  They were eating a mixture of Bil-Jac fresh frozen food and dry puppy food when they got better.  Good food is important, so that she can rebuild her strength.  Do some research on what high quality brands are available in your area.  They are pricey, but worth it in the long run with better lifelong health.   I also gave them acidophilus (a probiotic that replenishes the good bacteria in their gut-- available at Wal-Mart and elsewhere, get the billion parts one, read the label for this).  They perked back up and were complete terrors within a few weeks.  One went to a special prison training program, and another went to a competitive agility home.  If you're not comfortable with your vet's opinion, don't feel guilty about getting a second opinion.  I've learned, it's my dogs and my money, and I want to get my money's worth, especially on their vet care.  I would also hold up on continuing her puppy shots till she regains strength.  You don't  want to keep battering her immune system till she's healthy enough to handle it, and a week one way or the other on a booster shot won't hurt her if she's not exposed to lots of other dogs and people take off their shoes when entering your home.
krXQaZAfaa	Hi there, I am a Veterinarian Technician and I hope I can help you! <br>  <br>  First of all, congratulations on your new puppy! How exciting! Secondly, I do have two suggestions/strategies to help you stop your puppy from nipping! There are two different types of biting, agressive and play. It sounds as though the puppy is play biting. Please be aware if play biting is not stopped, it can lead to agressive/territorial biting even over something as silly as a sock they want to play with. I am also wondering if it is a quick bite or a clenched on bite, there are different ways to go about those. <br>  <br>  Anyways, luckily for you, it is not too late!! The first strategy I would like you to try is something littermates would teach each other when they were very young pups still with mom: Each time your puppy bites you I want you to let out that loud, earpiercing, yelp that I know you have heard from other dogs. That is how other dogs communicate to each other that the behavior is not acceptable. <br>  <br>  It is important that you DO NOT yell, hit (not even a tap on the nose!!), or bite your puppy back (trust me, I have seen EVERYTHING! It will create fear in your pup), instead let out a loud yelp. It might take a few times for your puppy to realize what your message is, but remember it is so so important to remain consistant! Don't yelp every other time she bites, yelp each and every time or you will leave your puppy confused as to why sometimes she can bite, and sometimes she can't. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work (it really should if done consistantly!) then you can try to associate a word with a behavior and a consequence. Think when you try to teach your puppy to sit. You associate a word ("Sit!") with a behavior (when they actually it) with a consequence (a cookie, praise, rubs, etc. remember... consequences are not always bad! they are just a result o a choosed behavior!). So apply the whole sit concept to the biting. Your word could be as simple as "Ouch!" (say it sternly, you can use a louder voice, but don't yell) when she bites (behavior) and the consequence (as SOON as your puppy releases from the bite reward them with a cookie, praise, rub, etc. Again, it might take a few tries (ok, maybe a week, so again, stay consistant. <br>  <br>  If you feel like the cookies, praise, etc. are not working you could absolutely still use your word "Ouch!" and then immediately pick your puppy up (not in an angry way, just sternly) and put her into her crate for 1 minute. Go on doing your business as she is crated, ignore any barking, crying, eye contact. Then after the minute is up let her out and praise her! Each time you say "Ouch!" and place her in her crate she will associate the behavior (biting) with the consequence (crate). <br>  <br>  Dogs are smart and want to please, she will catch on! Just remember to stay calm and assertive!|`|HjYn0nPpaa	It is never a good idea to let your puppy play with your hands or feet – no matter how cute it seems. This teaches your puppy it is OK to bite skin.<br>  <br>  Dangling treats and encouraging a puppy to jump for it can encourage snapping for food as well as working growing joints.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|fpxktwR0aa	Not in a mean way but being assertive grab him by the lower jaw with your thumb hooked behind the two lower fang teeth and briefly hold him shaking your other finger at him the repeating sternly NO TEETH, PLAY NICE! He will soon get the message. Do not smack hit as a response this will only encourage more aggressive behavior|`|sbC75HQ0aa	slap him/her on the nose and in a firm voice say NO BITE!!!.............it worked with my dog and now she is as sweet as she could be.....oh also when she does stop biting praise her!|`|txQ8tWIcaa	spank him or flick him on the nose. (This is not cruel, it's discipline) and watch the Dog Whisperer. It's a great show that will show you some good tips. <br>  Try taking him out on longer walks and playing more, this usually helps too.|`|p7swtBYzaa	It's not nasty, it is normal puppy "mouthing" - please read all the posting about this or get a book on puppy behavior.<br>  <br>  Make a sharp yip sound and completely ignore him when he does - stop playing with him.   That's what his mother would do - he will learn eventually that mouthing is unacceptable.<br>  <br>  Get a book on puppy training and behavior.

Ele ocorre entre 7 a 10 meses de idade, na maioria das ra?as. O cio é a época de "namoro" da fêmea, pois fora desse período ela n?o aceita a cobertura do macho. Diferentes das fêmeas, os machos n?o apresentam cio e podem acasalar em qualquer época. Os machos podem detectar o odor das fêmeas no cio a uma grande distancia. Um ferorm?nio é eliminado junto com a urina das cadelas nessa fase, e é ele que atrai os machos. <br>  <br>  Como identificar o cio:<br>  A regi?o genital externa das cadelas (vulva) come?a a inchar e observa-se um sangramento de leve a moderado. Chamamos de primeiro dia do cio, o dia em que se observa o início do sangramento.<br>  <br>  Dura??o do cio:<br>  Em média, o cio das cadelas dura de 15 a 16 dias. <br>  <br>  Freqüência do cio: <br>  O cio das cadelas manifesta-se a cada 6 meses, normalmente. Mas há cadelas cuja freqüência varia a cada 5 ou 7 meses, o importante é que o intervalo seja constante. <br>  <br>  Períodos do cio: <br>  Na primeira metade do cio, observa-se um sangramento leve que diminui ou desaparece totalmente em torno do 7o. ou 8. dia. Nesse período, a cadela deixa-se cheirar pelo macho, mas n?o aceita que ele monte sobre ela. Na segunda metade do cio, apenas o sangramento é evidente, embora muitas cadelas ainda possam sangrar. Nessa fase, as cadelas permitem a monta e o acasalamento com o macho. O final do cio é notado pela diminui??o evidente da regi?o genital e quando a fêmea passa a rejeitar o macho.<br>  <br>  Como evitar que a fêmea fique prenha: n?o permitir que ela tenha contato com machos do 7o. ao 15o. dia (ou final) do cio. A castra??o é uma excelente op??o para quem n?o quer que seu animal tenha crias. Uma vez castrada, a fêmea n?o terá o inconveniente do cio. O uso de anticoncepcionais n?o é um método totalmente seguro para a saúde do animal.<br>  <br>  "Cio seco": <br>  Algumas cadelas n?o apresentam sangramento durante o cio. Nessas fêmeas, é muito mais difícil identificar o momento certo para o acasalamento. Para quem tem um casal de c?es e n?o tem muita experiência, isso é um problema pois os acasalamentos indesejáveis poder?o acontecer. Algumas pessoas, por n?o perceberem sangramento na fêmea, acham que seus animais nunca tiveram cio. Cadelas mais velhas podem apresentar cio seco.<br>  <br>  As fêmeas têm cio até o final da vida. N?o existe a "menopausa" em cadelas.|`|VXLGd8Pkaa	O cio em média dura 15 dias.|`|bCFwjKfSaa	O cio varia de 7 a 15 dias, é o tempo medio, pode durar um pouco mais ou um pouco menos. <br>  Acontece duas vezes por ano, mas pode ocorrer até tres ou quatro vezes por ano, o que n?o é raro. Pode ocorrer o cio seco tambem, que nao acontece o sangramento em nenhum dos dias. Por isso é bom sempre anotar os dias do cio da cadela ( inico, fim e de quanto em quanto tempo ocorre), pois se ocorrer o cio seco, voce saberá que ela esta no cio e poderá evitar uma gesta?ao inesperada.

bgi54pWNaa	I had a husky quite a few years ago and she was one of the best dogs that I have ever owned. Yes they will protect you. Obedience classes would be beneficial for you and them, also they are very vocal not so much their bark but more like a howlish/ whining that they do. These are not outside dogs!!! Well no dogs are for that matter but being out in the heat for long periods of time these dogs can have a heat stroke. They love snow of course!!!! The Winter is their most favorite time of year!! They can be very loving and loyal dogs I will definitely get another again but I currently have too many rescues I am taking care of right now. Good luck and feel free to e-mail me with any more questions.|`|AA10029366	Siberians are very loving, but not loyal. They think you're fun until something more interesting comes along.<br>  <br>  A well-bred Siberian is NOT AGGRESSIVE. They are not a protective breed (having been bred to work in teams, and with multiple dog mushers, not to protect people), and they cannot be counted on to protect you if you are in trouble.<br>  <br>  They may be beautiful, but they are not the breed for everyone. They require a firm, experienced owner, and do not make good "first" dogs.<br>  <br>  More info on the breed:<br>  <a href="http://www.shca.org/shcahp2b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shca.org/shcahp2b.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shca.org/shcahp2a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shca.org/shcahp2a.htm</a>|`|bQrTAlTpaa	Escape artists! Yes!  You can almost guarantee that there will be at least one Husky in every dog pound across North America on any given day!  Check Petfinder and see the number of them available for adoption.  Not really good around younger children, not good around cats, and boy do they SHED!  Need lots of exercise, a dedicated committed owner with dog training experience.  They are also great at "landscaping" your backyard.  Hope you don't have any trees.  Not that they are all bad.  They are pretty to look at and I have seen some very highly trained ones.  Those ones had really smart owners who really worked hard with them.<br>  Those are just my observations over the past 25 years.|`|D8D1dadEaa	YES , they are very loving and protective .  if soemone yu dont know comes to yur house , they will bark and yu will notice it .  i always felt SOOOO safe with my dog around .  our dog would wander off , but only if someone purposefully let him out , but when he was younger he would always find his way abck home if we couldnt find him .  once he got older , he didnt even bother to wander off .  they are very loyal , protective , loving dogs and are also soo beautiful .  yu couldnt ask for a better pet .|`|EhtIZxcsaa	Huskies are wonderful dogs with a GREAT personality and a love of life! They will NOT protect you, but will invite a stranger into your house...and show them where all the good stuff is hidden. You will NEVER have to worry about them attacking anyone, dog or person (unless it is a poorly bred one).  They WILL take up for themselves. So if any other dog comes up to them aggressively, they will defend themselves. They can be stubborn, like to howl, high prey drive (will chase anything that moves) sheds a lot and are more toy then food motivated. Will RUN off at a drop of a hat, can escape from the house, crate, fenced in yard and love to run.  Make sure you like hearing WooWoo every morning, when you walk in the door, every evening, just because they can and they want to....<br>  <br>  Here is pat of the  Husky personality. My son was laying on the floor doing his homework. Keebler, my husky,  walks by, sees the pencil moving along the paper, runs up and grabs  the pencil, runs away from my son and takes off with a look like 'catch me if you can'<br>  <br>  They aren't for everyone, so do your homework and make sure this is something you want. <br>  <br>  They are  a wonderful breed of dog.<br>  <br>  Late Entry....<br>  <br>  Gee, Who is the thumbs down troll. Apparently, someone who knows NOTHING about Huskies!!|`|Q4IKIoxBaa	I owned a husky for 9 years, he just recently passed away.  Huskies are a very good pet.  They are loyal to just about anyone. But I have noticed that if you are the sole care provider for a dog, most times...he/she will love you no matter what.  When they see you...they will greet you...because they associate you with love and happiness. This might sound pretty girly....and the trainers and behaviorists might not agree but i have owned huskies my whole life.  They love you, if you love them.  However they are pretty hard to control in certain occasions.  They need to be stimulated...walks, runs, or you could even get into mushing.  My family and I own a sleddog kennel.  If you ever need anymore information, email me..I would be honored to help out.  Good luck!|`|S9MT4Tdaaa	They do make great pets, but i wouldn't recommend one for someone who doesn't have much experience with dogs. Definitely not for the first time dog owners. They need extensive training and socializing and when they do have this they are well balanced lovable dogs.|`|EKcLpIgyaa	Yes but they are runners and often escape easily and often if not properly secured.|`|Gm9KiIsZaa	Huskies will be loyal to anyone, not just you . THey are very friendly dogs and probably wont protect you. they are very poor guard dogs. <br>  <br>  Email me with question on what you want to know about them :) if you want!|`|M3xICUb6aa	You should get a Portuguese Water Dog.  They are loyal and loving---but they are too nice to protect you from danger.  (they will alert you though to people approaching....they just wont attack.|`|QzEUhb8Saa	Huskies were developed to be working dogs. That means   they have a lot of energy and need a lot of exercise. They do tend to be a one person dog although they are not unfriendly toward strangers.I have never known one to be protective of anything but his own food or chew toys.  They are intelligent and learn new things quickly but they can be independent and hard headed.They also tend to be escape artists and will not come back until they are ready. Anyone who thinks it is cruel to harness them and make them pull a sled has never tried to make a husky do something it does not want to do. If you can not give a husky enough physical exercise, challenge it mentally, anything to keep it from being bored. A bored husky will destroy everything in your house. They can also be very vocal with barks, howls and whines. Now that you have read all the negative things I have to say about huskies I will say they are very high on the list of breeds i would own as a pet. But they are a dog that needs a job.|`|XbfeW12kaa	I heard from a friend of mine that huskies like to run away. Usually they run away and burry themselves, but don't take my word for it! I think a loyal dog would definately be a cockerspaniel/cockapoo. I've got one and she's the most loving dog, she always has to be around me, even now she's laying at my feet as I write this, but not only is she loyal to me but my family too. And one time my mom wa sjust playing and pretended to hit me and my dog jumped on my mom and started growling. But that's just my opinion.<br>  All dogs are good. =)|`|kg4aOcKeaa	That really depends are what you are looking for. When getting a dog you are going to want to match your energy level first, and then think about what you want out of the dog. <br>  <br>  Huskies are usually very high energy level, simply because they are bred to be hard workers so if you are able to exercise them ( walk them for about 2 hours or so a day) then they will be great pets. They can be nippy and if not socialized properly, aggressive. Read a few books on them, and puppies in general and you'll be able to find just what you want. <br>  <br>  <br>  The problem with what you are asking for is that you want a protective dog and loving dog, which is fine. But it is difficult for a dog to be both of those things without vigorous training. Police dog training would work well for what you are looking for. But if you train a dog to protect you, don't expect it to be overly friendly to people and be cautious of situations you bring the dog into. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|vJg5k342aa	First of all, Huskies are not for the novice dog owner.  They require firm, consistent training throughout their lives.  They are NOT protection dogs.  They are notorious for being ineffective watchdogs or guard dogs.  Do thorough research on them before committing to one.  They can be very stubborn and need constant reminding that you are the boss.  They will take off running at the first chance they get so they must ALWAYS be on a leash.  They are escape artists so fences and invisible fences are not a good idea unless a tie out is used for backup.  They're very family oriented though, so they will be unhappy if left outside or away from the family for too long.  They shed constantly and heavily twice a year.|`|ftFRP0Omaa	they are escape artists and love to be outside and roam around. that is all I really know about them.

s9qjh3L1aa	It is from the asparagus.Some humans have the same reaction.<br>  Just feed him the dog food and the other raw stuff you have been feeding him that he hasn't had a reaction to.<br>  <br>  here is a list of things..<br>  <br>  * Apples (they contain potassium, which stimulates the immune system, and pepsin, which helps the stomach)<br>  * Broccoli (rich in vitamins)<br>  * Carrots (rich in vitamins, great treats to substitute for biscuits)<br>  * Cabbage (rich in vitamins, good for digestive system and skin)<br>  * Cucumber (good for teeth and bones due to potassium content; can combine with carrots to promote a healthy liver and kidneys; in juice form, a good diuretic … peel cucumbers unless organically grown)<br>  * Celery (chopped or juiced; can help with arthritis)<br>  * Garlic (removes waste from blood, can help repel fleas; use fresh garlic finely minced)<br>  * Green beans (lightly steamed; healthy and low-cal treat)<br>  * Parsley (can reduce allergy symptoms and aid kidney function; chop finely or boil parsley and add the juice over food)<br>  * Kale (rich in antioxidants and can help reduce allergy symptoms)<br>  * Spinach (very healthy; serve chopped)<br>  * Bananas (in small quantity; a coveted treat)<br>  * Olive oil (a tablespoon a day is good for skin and fur)<br>  <br>  * Preparation suggestions: Many veggies can be served raw, lightly steamed or in juice form. For most vegetables such as broccoli and carrots, it is far better to steam them instead of serving raw for improved digestibility and nutritional value. Also, since dogs have small digestive tracts, you can puree vegetables to enable your pet to digest more. If you use canned vegetables, get the salt-free kinds.<br>  <br>  * Organically grown benefits: Due to their smaller size and more compact body systems, pets can be more prone to the toxic effects of pesticide contamination than are people. So it is best to feed them produce that is organically certified, which also has higher nutritional value for everyone.|`|ks2z4po8aa	Googling foods and plants that are toxic to dogs one'll find long lists where it states: "Asparagus fern Asparagus setaceus Contains a wide variety of poisons resulting in a large range of symptoms."<br>  <br>  As for the poster above, Broccoli is also harmful to dogs, especially in its raw form... The toxic ingredient in broccoli is isothiocyanate and it is reportedly a pretty potent gastrointestinal irritant. <br>  <br>  You should definitely check the entire list, avoiding any of the fruits, vegetables and plants, and especially in their raw form... A couple of pieces of carrots are fine, but entire sticks of carrots can cause vitamin and sugar overdoses.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  <br>  TCMA|`|HF9sDyN2aa	it could be but asp. isnt bad for animals (like onions, grapes, raisens, choc. etc.)  maybe it just didnt agree with your pooch or the dog had a bug.  my boxer ate a bunch of chicken poop and it all came back up later in the house ( didnt know it until then).|`|ynEdpoj8aa	It sure could be even if he handles other vegetables well.  I would wait until he was feeling better before trying it again or just avoid it if he doesn't go nuts for it.|`|hju2jSsvaa	It could be from the asparagus, but mine eats it all the time.  I cook his asparagus tops though.  He likes raw carrots and broccolli.
AjSoD7pdaa	my pit likes iams canned food..not the mushy kind but the  meaty chunks in gravy. also i feed him kibbles and bits with meat chunks in it|`|F27az9NEaa	Pick a richer, more healthier dog food.<br>  Pedigree isn't a very good food.<br>  Also, ignore the ignorant person who said place a chain on your dog's neck. Psh..idiots.<br>  That's considered animal cruelty.<br>  Anyway, APBT are usually around 50-60 pounds, anything larger and you're working to hippo status.<br>  Pitbulls are an energetic breed, and those who I've met are pretty lean and very muscular.<br>  If you have concerns your dog is extremely thin, call your vet and talk about a diet plan for your dog.|`|DpNk8ZpLaa	Try to wean away from the canned food.  It is far too processed and does nothing good for his teeth.<br>  <br>  Get him on a extremely good kibble and supplement with a raw diet.<br>  <br>  You don't mention what kind of exercise this dog gets -- is he getting regular exercise?  I'm also not sure how old your dog is, but remember to keep the exercise appropriate for the age.  <br>  <br>  Because you have a traditionally aggressive breed, I hope this dog has completed, or is in the process of completing obedience classes.  It is especially important for you to socialize this breed with other people and dogs.<br>  <br>  While the last two points are not strictly related to food or weight gain, adequate exercise and mental stimulation will help his appetite more than being a lazy, couch potato-type dog.|`|ssiymvFIaa	I have pits and have for years.  My biggest is 96lbs her name is bisquit.  She was thin at first but my husband started mixing her canned food with dry food , and it was a weight ganner food that he got from walmart.  This was 2 years ago.  Finally as she aged we relied less on the can foods and just gave her the dry food.  This will have her relying less of the tast of sweet foods.  Then he started weight training her.  She would pull weights.   After that she just started feeling out with muscle tone and in weight.  Don't get the wrong idea she is a house dog.  I do not have my dogs on chains.  They are my big babies.  But when i take bisquit out for excercise she pulls weight.  Now whe is swole.|`|M1Z05yRZaa	i have been around ppl that raise pit bulls a lot of my life and the 1st thing you could do is but a whain with a heavy lock like a weight around its neck for a collar... it helps build muscle in the chest neck and front legs and then mix stuff in his food but keep using whatever it likes so it keeps eating... like eggs for protein and theres dog foods that r made for the purpose of gaining weight and muscle mass... its more expensive but worth it and like i said just mix it with his food a little at a time and add more as the weeks go by|`|Xvb79Ebzaa	give him choped pork for every meal! jk<br>  ummmm...........<br>  give him an extra serving of food
