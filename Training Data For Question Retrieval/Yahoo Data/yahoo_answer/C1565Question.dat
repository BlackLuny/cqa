20070303155329AA1zR0J	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Asheville, NC help on camping?	I went camping 10 years ago near Asheville, NC. I am looking to revisit the places I went to but cannot pinpoint the exact locations. I have tried google satellite images but to no avail.       What I can describe is I remember two things: 1) There was a rock slide where water ran down a rock face and people could slide down it into a pool. It was fairly popular because it seemed it was an attraction of some sort. 2) There was a small river that had huge boulders in it. We were able to actually jump from boulder to boulder down the river.      I can try to explain more of what I can remember, but any help is useful in trying to fin these locations. I am planning a camping trip in this area. Thanks!

20090202220510AAQ3lQc	Travel;Europe (Continental);Turkey	Classical Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria in 11 days?	I will be flying in and out of Istanbul and will be there for 11 days from April 1 this year. I am wondering what would be the best tourist route to see Classical Turkey, Greece (and maybe a glimpse of the most beautiful island heh) and Bulgaria in 11 days. I am not very much a beach person, so I am thinking that a ferry ride from Piraeus to Samos and onto Kusadasi may suffice. No idea if it is going to be scenic. I cant seem  to get much info from travel guides nor googling. So I thought I would ask.      My tentative itinerary is as follows:      Day 1 Arrive Istanbul. Leave Istanbul on Filia express to Athens   Day 2 Spend a day in Acropolis   Day 3 Delphi Tour   Day 4 Take ferry from Piraeus to Samos to Kudadasi - Any suggestion of which ferry that runs at this time of year?   Day 5 Ephesus tour   Day 6 Gallipoli   Day 7 Istanbul - Personal agenda   Day 8 Edrine - Personal agenda   Day 9 Sophia   Day 10 Rila Monastery   Day 11 Sophia?Poliv back to Istanbul - Is bus the best way or train?   Day 12 Fly out of Istanbul      Appreciate if you can advise of specific routes, transport details and approximate cost. Any other travel tips or suggestions to itinerary most welcome.      Please also advise  any tips for travel as a female if I choose not to join local tours.  Any tips for those tours like Ephesus or Delphi or Galiipoli appreciated.      I will be staying in hostels. Any tips welcome. Yep I am on a budget. Don't mind walking but I do have a bag in addition to a day back pack. If I were to take public transport, where are the storage facilities or locker room details.      Much thanks, Pearl.
