20090309131833AA7PEFv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Fourteen year old daughter's latest crush?	My daughters have all been into boys for a few years now - nothing crazy, just the normal crushes and 'dating' and gossip about who likes who. There are a few dances that they go to 'with someone' and such. They are in eighth grade, high school next year.      Allison has recently informed me of her latest crush - a boy two years older than her, a sophomore in high school. He will be a junior when she is a freshmen. I am not against age differences per se, but then again, it's never really come up. My daughters are open and honest with me so Allison pretty much knows what the rules are such. She also trusts me so that opens up our relationship quite a bit.      She knows this boy through friends and friends siblings (he isn't one of her friend's brothers, though, I know how sticky that can get!) and he can drive. I remember when I was her age hanging out with kids who could drive and it was the coolest thing ever, but now I'm so scared! He wants to hang out with her this weekend at a Battle of the Bands type thing, where his band is playing, then they're going to get ice cream afterwards. I don't know if I should let her. What's your take?

20090309131846AAMYFib	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 4 year old is not happy with her ear piercing stud posts sticking out. Any advice?	OK, so before anyone accuses me of being cruel for piercing a 4 year old's ears, it was her idea and her choice. I had planned to make her wait until she was about 7, but since we are fostering my neice while her mother gets her drug problem sorted out, and since she came to us at two with her ears already pierced, it seemed unfair to allow her to wear earrings but not my own four year old.      Anyway, to cut a long story short, the posts of the studs they put in for her are way too long for her rather small ears, The butterflies at the back of her ears are fastened tight and won't slide further along the studs, the result is that the earrings 'hang out' on the posts. Sure, we can push the studs back in so that the surplus post is behind her ear instead of at the front, but 20 minutes later it is back to where it was.      If this doesn't make sense, here is a picture of what I mean  http://barcodes.uampi.com/avasear.jpg       She is unhappy about what she calls the 'stalks' sticking out, but there is still 5 weeks left of the 6 week healing period before she can change them.      Has anyone had a similar problem and found a way to get the studs to behave?

20090309132358AAwqrvg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	2 weeks late. I have no symptoms of pregnancy. 2 negative pregnancy tests. Use protection & on pill. Pregnant?	As of today (March 9th) I have been 2 weeks late for my period. I've been on birth control for almost 2 years. There has been times when I forgot to take my pill until the next morning but that only happens about once a month. I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year and we still use condoms every time during sex even though I'm on birth control. I took a pregnancy test a week after my period was missed and it was negative. I took another one about 3 days ago and it was negative as well (both were First Response). I have NEVER been even a day late for my period and I'm freaking out. My stress levels have not been any higher than normal and I have no signs or symptoms of pregnancy. Could there still be a possibility that I am pregnant?

20090309132857AA1FsKG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Very sick 3 month old baby?	Bar the doors, make a sign, contagious offspring!!!   My 3 month old was diagnosed with the flu on Thursday.  Doctor promised that we were pretty much over it by the time we went in, but after a 5 1/2 hour wait in the local ER Saturday, seems it's still here, and strong.   Being so little there is absolutely nothing they could give my DD.  She won't take much of a bottle, so we're giving her pedialyte (sp?).  We're running a humidifier at night, using saline drops and suctioning her nose.  She's taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours (recommended by Doc).        This is absolutely overwhelming.  I'm not getting sleep, baby's not getting much sleep, daddy's not getting much sleep.  I'm not sure how to deal/cope.  I'm to the point I honestly don't know if I could handle having two children.  I'm emotionally, physically, and mentally drained.     My heart hurts because I don't know what to do to help my little one.  Being a mommy, I think I should be able to fix everything.         Has your little one every been very sick and there was nothing you could do?  If so, who did you deal/cope with the situation?   Doctor says 3-7 days for the flu.  It's been 5 and doesn't look like relief is coming too soon.

It's been 24 hours since I took the last dosage of the Cytotec, and I thought that the worst was over. Now, I'm having contraction-like pains again, and they're so bad that I'm still hurting even after taking Percocet about 1/2 hour ago.       How badly did your miscarriage hurt?  I phoned the on-call nurse and she said to wait and see if it resolved itself in a few hours... Right now I feel like I'm going to freaking die.

20090309140309AADNIS8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Y are people so f***** childish, and play so many games what happenes next.?	I had a daughter and she's about to be 3. Well when I had my daughter she was a preemie. Well the father of my child was very persistant about signing her birth certificate exc. I told him to lets establish paternity now, he declined. Well he was paying child support and stopped, he then says with this payment I am going to get a paternity test. I said fine. He stopped paying, never got the test and never contacted me. He wanted a test b/c I wanted nothing else to do w/ him I just wanted to move on! Allow him to see her but leave me alone. So I left him alone I had a job taking care of my kid. i met someone and we decided to get married. before I got married he contacts me again saying he wants a test, I said fine again you pay for it then fine. So he never contacted me after that. That time he called he said a bunch of mean things to spite me, I explained to him she's fine and i am getting married. So finally I get married, my husband is wonderful w/ my daughter and he is all she knows b/c when her dad was getting her he always dropped her to his family and nevr put in time w/ her. Anyhow I finally went o file child support and filed for paternity test, he was sent a letter to willingly come to take it he declines and makes the clerks office have to serve him which he knew they had 60 to 90 days to do. He says they want him they can come find him. After all this now I take the steps to get it done and he's playing games? why. Why not get everything done and everyone move forward in their lives?      Question why didnt he jus t go take the test when asked, why prolong if this is something he always wanted and thought I was running from and what happenes now that he already signed the birth certificate? Why does he even have a choice after that and how come they havent put the order through already?      What happenes next?
20090309144949AAPHIwS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	At 10wks would u start telling people your pregnant?	So far only only close friends/family know hubby and I are expecting! This weekend we have a big family party. I was wondering if it would be okay to announce our big news to everyone?! I have had several ultrasounds to make sure the the baby was growing and everything bc i had some complications that have since resolved themselves. But this past saterday my new OB (the dr who is going to deliver the baby) had me come into his office for my first visit with him. I was seeing a different OB but they can only follow you till your 10-12 weeks so I had to switch. NEWAYS!!! The new dr looked at everything with the baby and said it looked great. We looked at the brain and everything and he said it was looking great. We even heard the heart beat!! I have only previously seen it via ultrasound but we got to hear it this time! I asked the new dr if he thought I was out of the danger zone and he said yes most definately. He said all the baby has to now is grow. Everything else is there. So do you think hubby and I can start telling the rest of my family!?!!?!?! Would you?!!?! I don't see them all the time so I thought it would be a good time!         I will be 11wks3days on sunday when I see them!      thankss!!!!

20090309144809AAoIj8Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does it bother you when kids are dressed in rags, and their parents are dressed in the best?	I can't stand it when I see parents dressed really nice in name brand clothes, and their kids are dressed in rags. I realize you can't spend a whole lot of money on kids' clothes because they get ruined easier and the kids grow out of them so fast...  but I think kids stilll deserve to look nice!  I shop for my kids at Target, Old Navy, and Gap, on the CLEARANCE rack!!  I think shopping on the clearance racks is cheaper than buying used clothes at Salvation Army!  And the clothes are SO cute, and I've never had any issues with the quality if their clothes.  I know of a lot of moms who spend every weekend at the mall buying new clothes, and getting their nails and hair done so they can look pretty. Why can't they spend a little extra time with their kids, and cough up a few dollars to buy them some nice things too? I hate seeing kids in sweatpants with holes in the knees, old faded t-shirts, and clunky winter boots, and their parents dressed in the best.      Is it just me? Am I too picky? or.....  what do you think?

20090309141200AAGkeKl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Abortion is it bad or not?	I know many people would say its bad, but have you ever given a thought to it. Would you rather live knowing your family never wanted you? Humans dont simply follow the rules if we don't have abortion how much do you think child abuse would rise. You say they are the victim at least they weren't old enough to know what its like to be locked up in an attic and tortured and spanked each day. There are some families who do want their child and No those people wouldn't have abortion but what about does who don't. They should take their responsibility right? and what if they don't? what if there too stubborn to take care of their child? Wouldn't that child suffer more than rather growing up as an angel in heaven. Should they live the pain of being stabbed and tortured. When people get mad and have no control over there feeling who do they take it out on? Their half helpless kids who probably would soon wish that they were never born. Those children who were beaten and abused.

20090309145402AAYkSLX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I have a feeling my friend is lying about being pregnant?	Okay, so I have been friends with this girl Jessica for 13 years, she was with this really asshole boyfriend, they broke up because he cheated on her, or at least was talking to other girls on the internet. I was on vacation about a week ago when she told me that she was pregnant, she didn't even sound freaked out about it or anything. Which seems like the opposite of the way I thought she would react, I know her pretty well cause we have been friends since pre-school and we're now sophmores in highschool. Anyways, shes telling EVERYONE she's pregnant, when she first told me I told her I didn't belive her because I always kinda know when she's lying to me. She even told her Dad. But she got mad at me for not believing her. So she called me a bad friend. She said she took 4 pregnancy tests and all were positive but one, then she took me to the store and we got a pregnancy test with 2 tests in it, and she took one and before she even took it she said, "Oh well it might say not pregnant because one already said that." So I was like ummm okay? And I was in the bathroom when she took it, and she was like how do I do it. I said I thought you took 4 of these, and she said yeah but they were different, and I was like just cause it's a different brand doesn't mean they're different it's the same concept, and sure enough when the results came in it said, NOT PREGNANT. I was like what? And she was like yeah see I told you it was gonna say that because it's not the first pee of the day. And she told me she was constipated because "when your pregnant you get constipated" so we went and got laxatives, she didn't talk them because she thought "it might not be good for her baby" but I think it was because she was lying about having "pregnancy constipation." I think it's a total lie but she won't admit it. And she was afraid of taking laxatives, but when we went to the movies that night she couldn't help but smoke a cigarette because she smokes. And it just doesn't add up. And I told her to take the other pregnancy test out of the box, but she was like no i'll save it. And today I told her it was weird how her tests only say pregnant when no one else is around, and she got mad and said she'll spend the night at my house this weekend and show her a test when she has her "first pee of the day".   So do you think she's lying? And should I tell her dad I think she's lying? Or make her admit it to me then tell her Dad herself? Please this is the most heartbreaking situation. Sorry it's so long it's the only way I can explain it well. Also, she has been seeing her ex boyfriend still, the alleged father of the baby. And I hope she's not still having sex with him to try and get pregnant just to not get caught in her own lie.      heeeelp.

20090309144932AAXP8a2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I don't feel loved from anyone?	first i'm going to say this is long and if you want to help me read it all.   and sorry for the spelling/grammer         First I’m 15 about to be 16. In the past 3 ? months my life has went from great happy go lucky to crap. First i found out my dad was cheating on my mom. i didn't tell my mom for almost a month but it was destroying me inside( i lost 35lbs and i was having nightmares) i told my dad i knew first, he threaten me to not tell her. i finally told her. the had a huge fight for 2 days then my dad left with saying he hated me. (haven't seen or spoken to him since) my mom is blaming for the split saying if i was a better son... or if i would have told her when i found out... she told me she hated and wanted nothing to do with me and that i was a selfish person. and the last month and a week she hasn't looked or spoken to me.      To make things worst me brother who has been the medditor is leaving for college in like a month for early enrollment. Since this started I’ve been confused and thinking this is all my fault and etc… like if I were a better son neither of them would leave or hate me.      The one good thing has been my girlfriend( together for almost 3 years) I love her so much. She knows everything and has been there for me. We started having sex about when everything in my family happened. WE WERE having sex 3-4 a day for about 2 ? months. Having sex with her made me feel like someone actually loved me you know.      But I stop having sex with her a week ago because I felt like a bad boyfriend. She told me that I hadn’t been smiling since the stuff with my family and I haven’t told her I love her in two months.( I do love her). I mean she constantly trying to make my feel better and says that she loves me like 100 times a day but I haven‘t been able to tell her I love her back for a while. I use say it to her all the time but… she is also worried about my health and I’m 6’2 and I’ve went from 205 to 135 in like and month and a half.      So I stop having sex with her. I was having nightmares of her cheating on me every night since I found out my dad was cheating. I told her and she said not to worry that she only wanted me. So we stopped the sex and we made promise we wouldn’t have any type of “sex” with anyone but together (so no masturbation). It been driving crazy.      I also told my two best friend about my family problem last week. They kind of forced it out. They have been supportive and listening to me. Of them a girl my best friend has really been there for me the this last week and has been sleeping over and my house and vice-versa last week.      Yeah now I can tell my girlfriend is a little hurt from me not spending as much time with her and I haven’t been able to say I love you to her. My best friend whose girl that sleeping over and stuff almost kissed and I am confused. I love her as a best friend and she hot and everything but her not my girlfriend but I haven’t had sex in a while and I’m horny and confused. I want sex. I been thinking maybe if I cheated( I know just like my dad) I could get ride of the nightmares. Or I start back having sex with my gf I feel like I’m using her. and she deserves better then me. I’m confused from everything.      I don’t know whats wrong with me I know people care about me I just don’t feel love I use to feel from anyone.      Thanks for reading this I know its all over the place like my head right now. I would appericate advice.      But please don’t recommend a psch or school concelesor b/c I won’t go      thanks
20090309145914AAFyO3z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did you get into better shape during pregnancy then you were before?	Before I got pregnant with my second I was trying to get back into shape. I was overweight with my first pregnancy, and I am again. I'm not saddened by it, I just wish I had taken more of an effort. So, that's what I'm trying to do now. I know I can't do things like I would if I wasn't pregnant, such as don't over exert yourself. But, can I still get into shape while pregnant? I know I"m not going to see massive results, but maybe lose something. Inches, fat, whatever. I know it's ok for me to not gain a whole lot of weight, since I am overweight, so I was just wondering if it was possible to lose some inches or fat while pregnant.

My last period was middle of January. I keep running to the bathroom thinking it's "time". I never start! I don't understand where it is?? I got off the pill in September 2008 and had my next period in January 2009. Well now it's March 9th ... or 10th and I have no period. I know after getting off of the pill it takes several months to have a normal period, and that was my period in January. Now I've skipped February? I have cramps on and off, so odd discharge over the last few weeks on and off. No nausea, and my boobs aren't hurting like usual when I'm getting ready to start. I've been extremely fatigued and lazy for the last couple weeks, but then again I just got over the flu. I'm getting a blood test done tomorrow for pregnancy, but when my mother was pregnant w/ me, she didn't have a positive result for months. I'm afraid I might be pregnant and my hormone levels are like my moms (not high enough). Any thoughts?

My boyfriend and I always use a condom but the other night we didn't have one with us but things were getting heated.  So he put his penis in for a few minutes but we both knew that we shold be using a condom so we stopped.  Could i get pregnant after doing that? That happened on the 15th day of taking my pills that month.  Would i have been ovulating at that time? Could that cause me to become pregnant? Can you become pregnant while on your period? Were both worried that i may become pregnant? Please answer back with helpful info not smart remarks. Thanks :)

20090309163127AAbc3VR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What should i do about this? Really need some advice?	Ok so i have two different doctors, one is a high risk doctor and the other is my regular ob. But my last apointment she told me i lost 11lbs and i have tried everything (im 12 weeks pregnant by the way) protine shakes, high protine snacks, i eat from the time i get up in the morning until the time i go to bed, i eat a well balanced diet and sneak some junk and fast food in there now and then, I track my calorie intake and most of the time its in the 3000's but never under 2000 a day. Before i got pregnant i had this problem i would gain 4 or 5 pounds and loose 10lbs, ever since i was a little kid, but she tells me i am not eating enough even though i know im eating more then enough, and ever apointment i get a lecture of how im not eating enough and she wants to hear nothing else, and thretens to put me in the hospital if i dont get my *** in shape and start eating like i should (which i do) im 4'11" and weigh 84lbs by the way currently. I have crapy insurance and so i cant switch doctors because there are not many i can go to and the rest are guys (which i feel very uncomfterable with a guy ob) but im just thinking i shouldt go anymore only if i have a problem or something, my other doctor i just get ultrasounds and anything else he says to take up with my other doctor, idk wut to do im getting so frusterated that no one is listening to me, yes i dont have a medical degree but i think i know my body better then she dose, i have after all lived in it my entire life. Any suggestions on what to do? Anyone elses doctor not listen to them, i really wish i could change doctors but i would have to pay out of pocket      and please dont tell me to eat more, if i eat anymore ill explode = [

My 12-month old son has some horrible excema on his face (especially around his mouth, but also on his cheeks, on his eyelids, forehead, etc.).  He is teething right now... I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced such rashes on with their babies when they're teething?  I've heard a rash around the mouth or on the cheeks is normal for teething, but the rash on his forehead and around his eyes is baffelling me.      I have taken him to the doctor and they said it's fine (it's not in his eyes, just around them).      Thanks!

Okay I had a problem with my last pregnancy that I was carrying too much amniotic fluid, you are only supposed to have 180liters of fluid and I had 250.  That caused me to stretch ALOT and had lots of stretch marks on my lower belly.  I ended up having to have an emergency c-section.  What I want to know is has anyone ever had (with the next pregnancy after that one) the scar from that burn or itch severely?  It seems the bigger I am getting the more it bothers me.  If you have had that problem what did you do to help it?  Any suggestions would be helpful. :)  Thank you!

My sister and other son live with us, so doing it on the couch, or on the kitchen floor doesn't work. We can't sneak away to a motel because we truly just don't have the money.

I know this may seem like a redundant question, but my husband and I are sexually active, and I just can't do it with my son in our bed.    We also can't move him from bassinet to bed and vice versa either while he's asleep, because he wakes up so easily.    What do you co sleeping moms do?

If he doesn't say anything about getting another ultrasound though, can I ask him if he can send me to make an appointment to get one? I'm really anxious about that possibility of finding out the gender at 16 weeks. I think it would be worth an extra ultrasound to try and see if it's determinable. So should I ask him if he doesn't mention it to me?         Thanks, I appreciate the time.

20090309153513AAwceSA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I switch my baby's pediatrician?	My baby is 9 months old and his pediatrician seems unsympathetic and the whole staff seems unfriendly. Every time I call w/ a concern, they call me back hours later and tell me it's normal or to just monitor him for a day to see if his condition gets worse. Yes, he may be perfectly fine, but I am a first time mother, and I ever have any questions about his health I am hesitant about calling them now. He was coughing and wheezing, so when I talked to the doctor about that she said it was normal and that was how babies breathe in the beginning. I told her his upper lip was a bluish tint and she said it was just his coloring. She seems to brush off my concerns w/o checking into them. Is that normal for a pediatrician to do? Are my feelings unwarranted? Do you think I should try to find a better dr.?

20090227151902AA4jDhb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I talk to my step-dad about my step-brothers horrible diet?	My step-brother is 12 and all he eats is mac and cheese, pizza, and pasta. My step-dad doesn't realize how horrible this is on his system and the lack of nutrients he is getting. I am a nutritionist and personal trainer and he won't even listen to what I have to say, or what my mom has to say. He does not look overweight, but I know his fat content is way above normal. Once he hits puberty and continues to eat like this because his dad doesn't care or understand he is going to be so fat. Last time we went out to dinner he ordered (from cheesecake factory which gives you a huge serving) five cheese ravioli, but instead of getting it with the tomato sauce it comes with, he asked for alfredo sauce instead. He had three sodas with dinner also, and a piece of cheesecake to himself. Its just so insulting to be in the profession I am in and to be completely ignored is just so hard. My step-father is also a big wuss and won't discipline his kid or tell him to eat healthy and lets him do whatever he wants. I'm concerned about his health and I think he is too old to be at a point where he stills eats like a 5 year old. Any suggestions from other professionals or parents?

I accidentally left one at my MIL's house and she didn't see it until we came back a week after.  The leftover milk turned green already and of course, stunk so bad.  I cleaned it by washing thoroughly and boiling all the parts.  I am not sure though if this is enough cleaning.  A part of me just wants to throw the bottle out.  What do you think?      Also, I scrub all the other 6 bottles everyday.  Anyone else who uses the same bottles, can you please tell me how you clean yours?       Thank you very much.

20090227151638AA1UR7L	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	In your opinion whose fault is this?	Alright so my school has these school functions where you can pay 5$ to miss 3 hours and go watch a baseball game for example. If you don't pay for a ticket you go to class where you watch movies for example because the majority of the class is at the function therefore teaching is not effective.      I have tried to convince my parents in the past  to let me stay home instead of either options. The school frowns upon this. There are no reprecusions for it however.      Normally I always attend school or the function because my parents would not let me stay home.      Now the night before the function my sister tells me that she plans on getting us out of going and convincing my parents to let us stay home. I replied " Good luck with that"      I proceeded to set both of my alarm clocks for the next morning planning on going to school.      In the morning my sister tells me that my mother has agreed to let us stay home. I slept in having no reason to believe that my sister had not told the truth.(she never lies to me or my parents)      So I find out that she had not communicated that the school disproves of staying home instead of going to school functions. She selectively  informed them which is sneaky and wrong.       I in turn and my sister get grounded for the weekend. I think it is unfair because I believed my mother had decided it was all right for us to stay home.      If i had known I was not allowed by my parents to stay home I would have obviously gone to school as I have usually done in past school functions as it is definitely not worth any trouble over.      Thoughts and opinions?
20090227151739AAsYTS9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How to get my bf to be more understanding about pregnancy?	I am about 10 weeks pregnant. I am having a very hard time. Three weeks ago i came down with the flu and bronchitis at the same time. It sent me to the ER twice because I couldn't breathe and was dehydrated. This week I have a sinus infection( i have a history of repeat ones). and I have all day sickness. Also I get migraines( about 5 a week) which are worse with the pregnancy since they took away my meds. I was taking imerex(sp?) and codeine when i needed it before the baby.   I lately I have just been laying in dark rooms with only ice to help the pain. Because tyenol(sp?) is useless to me. I want my baby very much and am trying to be tough so the baby will be healthy. However my boyfriend is not understanding. Every time I lay down ,take a nap or cry because of the pain. he tells me about his friends wives who where fine when pregnant. How they work 12 hour days and stuff.    The bottom line is I feel sick and I hurt most days. All I want is a kind word and him to rub my back and understand what I doing  to grow our baby healthy.    How do I explain that without getting hormonal and throwing him down the stairs(jk)? Is it that he doesn't get it because I am the first pregnant lady he has to see up close as this is his first  baby.   Don't get me wrong before the baby he was a great bf. He works hard and is a good provider. He is just not supportive in this. Also he is a lot older then me by 20 years( i am 28 and he is 48). I don't know if that plays a part in it. Maybe older men at not as sensitive about feelings.

20090309174730AAuqIEy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Dealing with temper tantrums at bedtime?	For the past month or so, my five year old has been protesting going to bed.. I have made sure that she is not afraid or anything, she is just not wanting to go to bed. When she finally does get in the bed, she goes right to sleep. When she stays up late she is very cranky and hard to get up the next morning.    Last night it began getting out of control.. She had an absolute fit when I told her it was time to get ready for bed. It was not a screaming and crying fit, it was her arguing and backtalking and even slinging things. I told her that she did not talk to me like that, and she just shrugged her shoulders and pushed the kitchen chair over. We had such a good day, and I hated to do it, but that earned her a spanking. She got three spanks on her bare hiney and after that went to bed with no problem.   Tonight I told her it was time to get ready and she started to aruge. I asked her if she remembered what happened last night and asked her if we needed to do that again. She went straight upstairs and began getting ready and is now in the bed.   I hate to use spanking as a "threat" but I do not know what else to do at this point. Last night is the first time she has got a spanking for that. She has got spankings before, but not for arguing at bedtime. It worked like a charm though, and I doubt I will have to do again, becasue just a threat of getting her bottom spanked will straighten her up.    Is it ok to do the spanking thing? or is there a better way to prevent tantrums at bedtime?

20090309112750AA6WiBc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I dont know what to do?!?	I became pregnant when i was 16 years old with my daughter, who is now one, and i am almost 18. I think i might be pregnant again but somethings arent making sense to me. My daughters father and i had sex on feb. 28 and my period was supposed to come march 1. I calculated the fact that feb only had 28 days unlike other months which have 30 or 31, and my period still isnt here. I told my daughters father that i may be pregnant so we took 2 test, on two seperate days, and they both said no; they were also two different brands. So i called my OBGYN who delivered my daughter and i have an appointment friday. Could i be pregnant?!?

I work in healthcare and am required to lift upwards of 75 lbs on a daily basis (not every day but I work in home health so I have no one around to assist me usually). I am 6 wks pregnant now so I don't have my first OB appt for 2 wks and have not told my boss yet. I don't know what weight restrictions my OB will put me on and when, but I know she is not going to permit me to lift a 200 lb patient off a bed when I am 8 months along! I have short term disability benefits thru work. My job is not one where I can make it thru 9 months pregnant. It involves a lot of lifting and carrying heavy bags (as well as possible exposure to diseases like shingles). Will STD cover the time after my OB puts me on weight restrictions?

I cried so much when i found out i was pregnant again i didnt want a baby, i felt i already had my little girl but my partner(Now ex) talked me into keeping the baby i always struggled with my feelings people would say to me "when the baby is born dont forget about sarah" who is my other child i would sit and listen worrying that i thought it would be the other way around that i would love saras more than the baby. Then at 22 weeks i went for the second scan to find out she had fluid in her heart and chest i got refered straight to a specialist who told me it was the worse case he had ever seen and there was nothing they could do he only gave me a 10% chance of her surviving the pregnancy and she would then die on the way out. I decided to get induced so at 23 weeks i delivered my beautiful baby girl the moment i saw her all thoses doughts i had had went i new that moment that i loved her so much now 3 years on i cant stop thinking about it the guilt of knowing i didnt even want her for so long i feel it was my fault what happened my body did that cos of how i felt it hasnt got any easier i just dont no how long i can go on feeling this way

I am in my first year of college and my boyfriend (19) is in his second year. He is supposed to go to a college 9 hours away next year to start on his basketball career.

He has been pressuring me to have an abortion or take the abortion pill even though it is against everything i believe. My heart tells me to have the baby and give it all i can. He keeps telling me how i hold 3 lives in my hands and that i will mess up his life if i go through with it and that i shouldn't bring a child in this world if we will be struggling with money. He told me that if i choose to keep it, then he will do everything in his power to make sure i dont have it. He told me there is no way he wants to have it. Is it wrong for me to want to keep the baby? He has layed out all the negatives of having this baby, but what are some positives if i keep it?
20090309113239AAM3jO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can I pass blood clots or what looks like tissue, and still carry on with a healthy pregnancy?	I went to the ER last night because of light bleeding cramping and lower back ache. Did an ultrasound and the doc said it didn't look like a normal pregnancy should look like at 7 weeks. She said there was a clot or a collection of uterine tissue that looked like it would pass through the cervix, and it did, it was about the size of 1/2 tsp. After the ultrasound was done, I started bleeding more heavily and passed what looked like a blood clot a little bit larger than 1/2 tsp. I was very upset when the doc came in to go over all the test results with me, so I didn't ask any questions. Now I'm kickin myself in the butt for it. I'm just wondering if anyone else has bled and passed tissue and still carried on with a healthly pregnancy?

Hi there      I am 22 weeks pregnant and am waiting to see the Dr about some pains etc etc i have been getting, as my health care worker (used to be a midwife) has suggested i may have SPD.      My pains i get and have had it happen 4 times now in just under 2 weeks they are like the worst period pain going right deep down in my uterus and then my vagina feels very heavy, and they even make my womb contract at times and the pains come every min or so and then die down, Paracetamol seems to ease my pains along with a bath but after find it very painful to walk bend and just generally move.       Also this pain can be brought on when i have walked about for a long time or when i have sat down for too long. Also when waking in the morning i am in alot of discomfort and have been from about 14 weeks pregnant and no amount of pillows etc etc seem to ease this and it will continue to be painful throughout the day. I get a very dull ache in my back everyday and like i say its worse in the mornings. I do find it hard to move about even if these pains have not been severe and i find it real struggle to bend and get out of bed.      Did anyone suffer from Spd? what did you do to naturally relieve some of the pain you are in? what did your pain feel like?    Is any one who is pregnant at the moment and suffering from this?

I had a 4D ultrasound done on march 7th I was 19 weeks and 5 days then.The tech asked me if I was feeling every lil kick Isabelle was making.And I said yes and asked her why.She toldme that I have a placenta basically on my back instead on the front of my uterus.She told me there is only a few inches between my baby and me and thats why i could feel everything.Could my placenta being towards my back cause a problem in pregnancy or labor??She did say it could cause back labor which i had with my son.

20090309124742AAFfQ3V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Some pregnancy questions ?	please, only answer these questions on your first child :)   the reason for these questions, is for a school project.   how old were you with your first child ?      Premature birth questions:   how many months premature where you ?   how much did your baby weigh ?   how long were you in hospital ?   how long was the baby in hospital for?   what was wrong with the baby ?   what kind of needles did you have in you ? like IV etc.. ?   how long till you could take the baby home ?   were you allowed to hold the baby ?         pregnancy questions:   how long were you in labour ?   how long after giving birth, did you lose the pregnant belly ?   when your water broke, did you go straight to the hospital?   from the time your water broke, how long till you started pushing?         Random questions on it:   what kind of stuff did you bring to the hospital for the baby ?   did your partner stay over night with you (if you did stay the night)?   if you had a boy, do they ask you if you want them circumcised ?   what do they do if they take your baby's foreskin off ?   do they do it right after birth ? or do you get to hold them first and they do it at a later time ?      i know none of these questions, really fall under the same thing. but please if you answer then, copy and paste the questions, so i know what your referring to, so when i put all my information together for my project, it makes since :)      thank you so much in advanced for helping me :)      what is a 'midwife'?   is there any symptoms your about to give birth before your water breaking ?   what are braxton hicks ?
20090309134346AATCcVS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Uhm....why does everyone say that this should be done?	Okay, so while answering some questions last night, I came across one that said that you need to start sleeping specifically on your left side. Which makes absolutely no sense in my mind.       The only reason I could come up with, is that you don't want the wait pushing on the baby's head if the head were towards the right, but what if the baby's head is on the left?      So I'm just confused haha. I'm 18 weeks and not my doctor, nor my pregnancy counselor, nor my family, nor my midwife has mentioned needing to sleep on my left side. Does ANYONE know what that was about? And if it's true, think you can explain it to me?      Thanks!

Has it been right for any of you. I did it the other day and it said my baby is gonna be a girl. Im impatient to find out. lol.  I know that its just a myth, but I was just wondering for fun. thanks.

20090309123154AAzDOKz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I make the transition from co-sleeping to my daughter being in a crib?	She's almost five months old and I co-sleep with her. I find we both sleep better if she is on my chest listening to my heart beat. I don't move at night when I sleep so she doesn't get hurt. The thing is now, I'm constantly travelling between France and England and I feel as if it would be easier if she slept in a crib. The thing is my flat is way too small for a crib, my bed is in living room as I have a 3 room flat and it's tiny.      Would it be a good idea to put her into a cot now or not bother until I move completely to England?
20090309133502AAIIj56	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Shouldn't I have more symptoms?	I misscarried last year in july. Since then my body stop ovulating and i did two cycles of provera and clomid.

Last time though I was still getting negative hpt's at 6 weeks (even the one at the dr's). This time though I think i might be pregnant again but I don't seem to have as many symptoms. I feel tired all the time, nausea,hungry all the time (wierd for me), and my breast are only tender if i push them towards my chest (a little sensative). Going to get blood test this week.

20090309133447AAFuvc2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What would you do if your nanny got pregnant?	I know everyone's situation is different so ill give you mine. I work with 2 children ages of 1 and 2.5. I love them dearly, i know thats not relevant but i do:)      *Anyway, by boyfriend of 6 years and i have been talking about getting married soon and planning our future. I work full time as a nanny, and i am finishing my AA at night classes. Then i plan to go into a nursing program.       *So i missed 1 pill this month. I never do that, but i am 1 day late on my period (I know no big right?) And my boyfriend and I have been talking about what we should do if i am pregnant. He works full time. I work 3 days and long hours a week as a nanny. I am worried that if i am pregnant that the parents will fire me. They are very catholic, and i am afraid of being judged. I know im 22 and in a committed relationship but to others that isnt enough (we would still prefer to concieve after marriage)-but things still happen i suppose.   We make it financially and have a 2bdrm. apt in a good area of town. Im just afraid that if i am pregnant that we wouldnt be able to make it financially if she lets me go. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IF SHE IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ANY SITUATION THAT SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LET ME GO. I am a very understanding nanny, and while some are okay with the nanny being pregnant and working with your children, or even bringing the baby to work, some are also not. I just would like to hear your opinion. I also would like to know what to expect if i DID get pregnant. I have always worked for companies that would allow maternity leave, etc before i worked as a nanny, about 10mo ago. So i never thought of what i would do until now that i am a nanny.      *Please no judgements, Its not what i need, i would just like opinions. A simple "Yah i would let her go" is fine, but this isnt an invitation to question my morals. I do appreciate the help. Thank you

20090309123653AANXBeJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby with a bad cough!?	My 7 month old baby has a bad mucousy chesty cough. She has had it for about 4 weeks now and she wakes in the night unable to clear the mucus. We have taken her to the doctor who said that her chest is clear and that we just need to ride it out! Does anyone have any tips/ideas? I have tried elevating the mattress, Karvol and tixylix etc? Just wondered if there is anything I haven't tried?
20090309124544AARzZ2n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant? Extremely worried.?	I don't want to be really explicit, so sorry if this sounds a bit vague.       Is it possible (or likely) to get pregnant if you have not had sex but have had semen on your fingers, wiped it off (but not really really thoroughly, and haven't washed it off with water/soap etc) until the fingers aren't wet any more and then had the same finger inside you a few minutes to half an hour after? Doesn't semen have to be ejaculated into the vagina for pregancy to occur? Urrrrgh, paranoia :S. Please help. Will taking a pregnancy test 7 days after the event be able to tell you if you're pregnant?
20090309125234AAkhd5i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	9 1/2 Weeks Pregnant, All test Say Fine, But HCG level doesn't. Please Help With Advice!?	Went to ER on Friday for brownish discharge. They took HCG level and it was 72,071. Today is Monday and went back to have a repeat and HCG dropped to 70,*** (something) they did both types of ultrasounds an we got to see my baby and it has a wonderful heartbeat of 167 (heartbeat should be above 120). Cervix is hard and closed so doesn't "SCREAM" miscarriage but what can be wrong? I never had this with my first child and this is my second pregnancy. The ER ObGyn Dr said I shouldn't worry unless I have clots or see RED blood. I haven't seen them or had any BAD cramps. Its just this HCG level thing that bothers. I will be 10 weeks on Thursday so I know the worst is almost over!

Aged 22, Combined pill aged 14-19, docs stopped me on that due to migraines, tried mini pill, awful! then depo for the last 2 years, with a year and a half of irregular/constant bleeding, unsure whether there was underlying prob doc stopped depo injection and did not give me one in aug 2008.       Since Aug 2008, i have not used birth control with longterm partner, bleeding settled down, and have not had identifiabe period since august, both partner and i are sick of the bleeding so are happy with letting my body get back to normal - with consequences of pregnancy acceptable, i have had no bleeding for 2 and a half weeks, which is very very unusual and the longest i have gone without bleeding in 2 years. My partner has noticed i'm ratty, irrational, tearful, complete opposite to my easy going relaxed self, am i admit, i feel he is really 'getting on my nerves' at the moment... 2 weeks ago my nipples were soooo sore, now in addition my breasts ache and are sore also, especially when i take my usual bras off, sleeping on front is agony, cuddling up in bed also hurts them, we have had unprotected sex 3/4 times a week since september, i take regular HPT's and last took a preg test thursday night and was negative, i cant wait for a period as i havent 'had a real one' for years.... what next??? xxx
20090309141211AAq6oUr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you think I'm pregnant? Someone please help :(?	I'm a virgin, but my boyfriend fingered me deeply last Tuesday and last Saturday and he said he didn't have any semen on his hands but i think there's a chance he could have. I've been freaking out that I could be pregnant for a week now.  I was supposed to get my period on Wednesday, but last night I thought I got it.  It was more of a dark brown discharge. This morning it turned into bright red with some of the brown stuff, but it's not heavy at all.  I usually have a really heavy flow at the beginning of my period.  Could this be spotting because of pregnancy?  I've read that stress can make your period lighter, and i have been REALLY stressed out lately because of school, problems with my dad, and this pregnancy thing. Do you think I have anything to worry about?

20090309175010AAaxPYJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Immunisation question?	Is it still effective if two different brands are given as two boosters of a vaccine?      Infarinx hexa (for diptheria, tetanus ,whoofing cough, polio, hepatitis B and Hib) was given at 2 and 4 months. It could have been repeated at 6 months but the one that has been given was infarinx IPV ( whidoes contain antegens for diptheria, tetanus, wohoofing cough and polio.) There is a vaccine called comvax which contains antigens for hepatitis B and Hib, and would it be still effective if I give it to her, so that it covers what has been missed out at 6 months?      My poor baby, when i realised doctor has messeed up with vaccines I went there to clarify it, he just slips away from the problem saying correct vaccine was given, it was written in the book incorrectly. How on the earth I would take his word and do nothing when he hasn't even entered a batch number of the vaccine so I got no way  to check it out with medicare?         Pls help me guys I am so helpless.
20090309174642AA51iDs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How much should I charge for childcare?	I am going to start caring fulltime for my husbands counsins child while the parents work. I already have four children of my own, so it will be lots of work, but I am up to it. They were considering day care but are more happy with the idea of me watching her. I just do not know what to charge them. I would like to only charge them about 2/3 of the cost of daycare. My kids have never been in day care, so I have no idea how much it costs.  What should I charge her? How much does day care cost for a one year old usually?

I know I sound totally stupid, but I'm only 13. so please don't call me dumb, i do tend to worry more than others..      I was at the park, wearing THIN leggings, and thin underwear from victoria's secret.

But right before i fell on the playground bar, my friend punched my stomache and i had to go pee so i kinda, well peed a little.      I want to know, is there any POSSIBLE way that i could be pregnant? i'm expecting my period soon, in a couple days, and the temperature outside was about 45-50 degrees. if sperm can "swim" can't it swim in my pee...      how long does sperm even live? i get different answers all the time.      NO IT DOESNT DIE WHEN IT HITS AIR.      make me feel better please! =[
20090309174559AAbpVXO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Calling all Moms and Moms to be:  Did your daddy to be ever have a freak out?	My husband has been estactic for our baby boy to get here ever since we found out (we tried for almost a year) and it's his first child, my second.  Yesterday, however, he came home and as soon as I mentioned the baby he started acting all funny and sort of shied around the conversation.      Then I asked him what was up and he told me he thought he couldn't do it and was freaking out about the baby being born and I didn't know what to do, because I am as cool as can be.  So, I guess after all that my question is, did your S.O. do this at any time during your pregnancy?      I am 33 weeks so I'm close, but hopefully not too close.
20090309174725AAttaVs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My whole family thinks that I'm a lesbian?	Not that being a lesbian is a bad thing or anything but the fact of the matter is that..I'M REALLY NOT!      A few months back I went through a feminism stage where I really disliked men because this boy was bullying me (I sound very immature, lol..) and I just started saying to nearly everybody in my family "I hate men! They're so ugly, They're so annoying!" and silly things like that. And I even said a few times "I don't care, I'm a lesbian" and I sounded quite serious if you ask me.      Most of you are probably going to say "Go and get a boyfriend" but I can't because I respect myself too much and at the moment I only just turned 17 and just so people don't think I'm a **** I'm saving myself until I'm 18-19.      I would talk to them about it but I'm too embarrassed to even talk to them because I feel like they think I'm something that I'm not. It's making me feel insecure. I want to move to a place where NOBODY knows me because of this. I'm being really serious aswell....      I'm 100% NOT a lesbian, I love males, I plan on getting married and having kids. There is No reason what so ever for them to assume I'm a lesbian, I don't look like the stereotypical tomboyish lesbian, I'm EXTREMELY girly, I love fashion, make-up, hair, pink.. ect. It's definitely the way I spoke about men in the past, and now no matter what I say or do my mom STILL thinks I'm a lesbian.      Please help me out here :-(
