People go on and on about how biased mainstream media is these days, but do these same people actually try to do anything about it?      Well, lets say there actually was someone out there in the world who wanted to try and stop media bias instead of sitting on their computer, complain about it, and fool them self into thinking they're actually doing something about it.      How would this person go about doing that?

20090227085215AAPrplD	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Are you tired of hearing about the octuplets in the news every single day?	It seems as if the mainstream media is obsessing over the story of this woman who already had six kids and gave birth to octuplets. Every morning, every station it seems, keeps talking about her, her doctor, her grand parents, etc. Aren't you tired of this.      Frankly I think she did it for the fame and fortune. She wants to get onto "easy" street by getting book deals, getting onto Oprah and Dr. Phil, getting million dollar homes, getting taxpayers to pay for nurses and social services etc.

20090227091556AAMaHf4	News & Events;Current Events	Do you believe in non-violence? Do you think initiating dialogue with terrorists is a good idea?	i think its worth a shot...       India: Martin Luther King III, son of legendary civil rights leader Martin Luther King Junior, who is on the last leg of his 14-day visit to India to commemorate 50 years of his father's visit to the country in 1959, said non-violence is the key to solutions of all conflicts. "It may be the terror at Mumbai, or the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians or the one at Sudan. I believe non-violence as a philosophy can succeed in solving all these conflicts," said King who is the founder of Realising the Dream, an NGO that aims at promoting peace and harmony across the world as well as alleviating poverty.       King believes in initiating dialogue with terrorists. Speaking to mediapersons at the American Center in the city on Thursday, King III said: "We should even speak to a terrorist who has also a son or a daughter. We should open dialogue with them. That is the way we can tackle terrorism."'       Earlier in the day, King paid a visit to Mother House (Mother Teresa's Convent) and offered floral tributes. Later, he visited Gandhi Memorial Bhavan.
20090227091926AA4Ij67	News & Events;Current Events	What will CBS do, now that pouting, swearing, club throwing Tiger Woods got eliminated yesterday?	They won't be able to virtually ignore the rest of the field so that they can relentlessly and disgustingly hype Woods, and bless the ground he walks on....at the same time that their cameras show him slamming his club down after a shot that is not perfect enough, or screaming swear words when he is unhappy.  The announcers must be under the threat of death if they dare to comment on his boorish, disgusting behavior.  Watching the demeanor of class players like Retief Goosen, or Palmer and Nicklaus in years past, and then watching Woods is enough to make you throw up.  Seeing him lose yesterday was the best news I have had for quite a while.  What a world-class jerk.

"Canadian fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a snooping Russian bomber over the High Arctic on the eve of U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Ottawa last week."      Russia is saying that it was a training exercise, but, being a Canadian, it makes me a little worried.         http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadia...       ~~

20090307160822AAmyvsn	News & Events;Current Events	Who else agrees that this recession is a good thing?	I mean people will save their money.  Cook for their families every day, stop eating out everyday, use coupons, shop at Wal-Mart like Blue-Collar, working class Millionaire's do.  Comparison shop, save their change, stop trying to be "big" and live large like some Hollywood actor who could care less about you or some Hip-Hop performer who is living on the edge and would take us out at the first chance they got.  No more SUV.  No more sports car.  No more keeping up with the Joneses.  No more Timeshares.  No more Mc Mansions.  No more Nanny.  No more Maid.  No more 25 pairs of jeans.  No more Digital Cable.  No more 5 Satellite Dishes.  I'm sorry for the brutal language, but Americans did not save like the Asians did so they are losing patience.  The economy will turn around.  Be frugal, be patient, eat less, want less, stop trying to out do your neighbor in houses and cars.  Stop looking for the "fast money."  We are not Rockefeller's, Vanderbilt's, Gucci's, Armani's, Kennedy's, Windsor's, Walton's, Ford's.  Save your money, save your money, save Americans!
20090307162201AAspk0e	News & Events;Current Events	Do you believe people who don't smoke marijuana are oppressed?	I believe they are. People who don't smoke marijuana are a dying breed. More and more people are taking up this dangerous drug and their culture has become commonplace in society. It's viewed in a positive light in TV shows like Saturday Night Live, stoner movies come out to the theaters like every month, and more and more pot smokers are getting their way when it comes to the laws regarding possession and use. As a non-stoner, I am outraged by this sudden barrage of pro-weed culture and propaganda and I know all other non-stoners are too. People who don't smoke pot are oppressed by society. They are forced to put up with these stoned losers and have no choice but to give up their mind and free will and join their ranks. Marijuana is a very dangerous drug used by very dangerous people. How can a non-stoner tolerate all of these debates on legalization and a culture promoting smoking something that's been proven to cause cancer and mental problems? It is up to all non-stoners to retaliate against these pathetic druggies and prevent more and more cities and states from going up in smoke from legalization/decriminalization. I don't think there are any non-stoners who support legalization because we all know better, right?
