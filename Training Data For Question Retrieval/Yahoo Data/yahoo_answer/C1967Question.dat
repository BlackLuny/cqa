20090223130252AAUyPr0	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	10 POINTS FOR BEST ANSWER: T-Mobile Blackberry Curve 8320 moisture sticker?	Hi. About two weeks ago, I lost my blackberry and paid the $130 deductible for a new one. Ever since I got the new one, it has been freezing and restarting itself periodically. Yesterday, I went to take it off the charger and it wouldn't work at all. When I called for a replacement phone, they asked me what color the water damage indication sticker was. I couldn't find it so they were going to make me buy a new phone. I said I would call back when I had the money. Then, I was looking at the battery today and I found a tiny white rectangle with a red stripe through the middle. Does this indicate water damage? I would be more than happy to pay for a new phone if it was something I did wrong but I have been super careful with my new curve so I doubt it is my fault. I haven't dropped it or gotten it wet at all. BUT I read online that having it in the bathroom while you shower can possibly trigger the sticker and I have done that. So, I guess my question is;       What does an undamaged water indication sticker look like for the new Blackberry Curve 8320 with 4.5 software and the smooth battery?       The insurance company is Asurion, by the way. I don't know if that makes any difference though.        Thanks in advance!

20090223143755AAgqLmU	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Best Technique To Fix Xbox 360 Game Disc?	My Fifa 09 Keeps freezing   it worked perfectly fine the last 2 months I've been playing it but today when I finished a match it went to the part were it loads like the Player wages,other matches,Transfers,etc   and it barely reached 17% and    BAM!   It just stoped    and I kept it there for like 10 minutes and it still didnt budge.   I noticed it froze when I tryed to bring up the Xbox Dashboard and it did'nt work either    plus the background wasnt moving side to side.   So yeah I think this happend because I never have my xbox in once place .I usually move it from my room to the living room to my other living room and yeah.   So the game just has some Scratches around the edges and stuff but all over not just one spot.   not real big scratches just the size of a finger nail or two       So yeah whats the best Technique so I can use to fix it?      I checked this vid out and looks pretty Reliable but I just want to know your opinion on this.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwXSuDhp8...       Because I could use the toothpaste technique or just take it to some store to clean it.   So yeah what should I Do?

20090223150728AA7HjeA	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Computer causing speaker noise?	I recently built a new computer for use in my home recording studio.  With this new computer, I have noticed that I get terrible noise on any sound system that is connected to it.  My computer speakers buzz constantly.  I also have a PA system that I plug into the computer from time to time.  This gets noise just as bad.      My old computer that I used never had this problem.  As soon as I upgraded, HORRIBLE (and I mean HORRIBLE) noise constantly pumps out of my speakers, almost to the point where I cannot enjoy listening to music.        I have ran tests and have come to the conclusion that the noise is definitely coming from the computer itself.  It is not RFI.  And it is not EMI coming from any other electronic devices in the room.  I have isolated the computer to be the problem.      I know that you can buy ferrite beads and donuts to wrap cords around to reduce noise, but is this the only solution?  If I were to do this, I would need to buy longer cables to connect my sound systems to my computer.      Any suggestions?  This noise is driving me crazy!

I thought you had to forfeit your phone if you cancel, and/or pay exorbitant fees.        Are these sellers just getting the iPhone with an AT&T plan, selling the phone but keeping the plan, and then using an older phone for two years -- all to make a small profit?
