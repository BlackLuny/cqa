I DIED!   when i came to, i told him calmly never to use those words.  and he said he knew that.   i'm thinking of telling the teachers about this (and hoping none of these words came from them, dear lord!).  i mean, i know you learn the bad and the good in grade school but they should be able to know (and hopefully put a stop to) this, right?   i may be overreacting, too.  i mean, my boy did say that he knew those were bad words and that they should not be used.  but wow.  just wow.

My 20 month old daughter seems having trouble sleeping, for the first 2 or 3 hours she sleeps ok but afterward she starts turning, twisting and making strange movement on  our bed like sitting on her knees.

Sometimes I also notice her scrubbing her head as if it was itching.....any opinion please?
20090205003351AAN6ngC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it O.K. for my son to be getting up at 6:30am to sleep with me at 14 years old?	When we both have to wake up one hour later at 7:30?       We both wake up at 7:30, when I have work and he has school. Every morning at 6:30; I'll find him fast asleep all curled up, hugging right on to me, and pretty tight! I think its SOO adorable and sweet. It really makes me feel good inside and just totally lucky, and I'm so happy for him because this is the first time in his life where he actually experiences love, affection and cuddling everyday; I adopted (now as a single mom) just last october, really just had abusive parents and a not so good childhood.Took a little over a month for him to completely open up to me and trust,  and knew that I actually loved him and would never hurt him. Its basically that he just wants to spend that last hour with me to cuddle and to talk with eachother for a bit before we have to get up and ready.      That all being said, Is it O.K. as in Healthy in his development stage to just continue how its going? I just can't see how it would have any negative affects, but I would love to hear your opinion or input.. Its always just for that 1 last hour, but on weekends when there isn't school, he always wants to sleep with me.  I'm completely fine with it on weekends. Thats when we might be up until 2-3 in the morning watching movies etc, thats usually when we spend the most time with eachother. But for now, is it not something I should really be too worried about, if its fine for now as he's still just hitting development?

My husband thinks it is bad when our son cried and throws tantrums and will make our son look him in the eye and will tell him that there is nothing wrong with him and to cut it out. I see him do this and my son looks like he is just bottling up all those feelings. He even tries his best not to cry. I think this is unhealthy for my son, how can I explain all this to my husband without alienating him, or making him feel like I don't think he loves his son. He is just so controlling when it comes to our little one, I worry that he won't develop emotionally. PLease help

20090205001623AAlGLFG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it a good idea to compromise with your kids?	I read somewhere that if you and your child don't agree on something it is a good idea to ask them to come up with possible compromises until you both agree. It said that it teaches kids to problem solve and learn how to resolve conflict with mutual respect. This idea makes sense to me, however I wonder whether this is giving kids too much power for their age.
20090205005351AAneO2k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Is there anyway to get out of foster care before turning 18? And are girls more often adopted then boys?	Hey ...   Im 16 years old and ive been in foster care since I was 5. Ive been in three different foster cares with other kids and im usually moved around pretty often. So id like to know if there is any way to legally be an independent without turning 18 years? If I could go get a job and live on my own.   Ive stopped expecting someone or a family to come along and adopt me a long time ago and I cant get any information on my birth parents because of the legal thing and I was given up young. The fostercare I am at now is hell and worst then the last few ones I have been placed in and ive tried running away twice before but it never works. No one gives me a look or any consideration because I have anxiety problems and im insecure. Im damaged goods I guess lol..? Ive stopped hoping for a family at this point you get tired after waiting and hoping for years. If there is any legal way to go on my own thatd be perfect but I doubt it. ... I dont know where id go if I tried to run away again either      Also are girls more often adopted then boys? Is there an actual proven facts I mean. Almost all of the girls my age at the foster homes ive been to have been adopted out. Im almost always the oldest one at all of the homes ive been placed at in the boys too though ...      thanks ...       lee

20090205011033AAZ9vLn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	HELP! Troubled teen- do wilderness/brat camps work?	I have a fifteen year old daughter with ongoing behavioural problems.      Anger, violence, drinking, smoking, compulsive liar, school work gone down the drain. etc etc      We have done the rounds of therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc.. I have even resorted (even though it nearly killed me) to calling the police on her whilst she was smashing up the house..      She has been given a clean bill of health and not diagnosed with any mental illness. She has many emotional issues though specifically with her father who has emotionally abandoned her in the last few years. (I brought her up on my own.)      Somewhere underneath the angry ball of fire there lies a great kid, she has many lovely qualities, a great personality, bright as a button, and is stunningly beautiful.      She has now started making up lies to her friends about me saying I am putting poison in her food. I know she doesn't believe it herself (she wont even make herself a sandwich shes so lazy) and thankfully neither do her friends or the school. Its attention seeking or a cry for help. Either way its incredibly upsetting and hurftful.      The stress of it all is taking an enormous toll on my health and happiness and I am really at the end of my tether now.      I have been looking into the possibility of sending her to a wilderness camp in America ( or brat camps as they are sometimes called.) I wonder if anyone has any knowledge or experience of them. It would be a strain financially ( I have no idea how much they cost but I can imagine it will be thousands) If I think it will get her back on track as a human being it will be woth it..      Any advice would be hugely appreciated,       Thanks

20090205013134AABrJFz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When is the best time to take a HPT?	Due to my situation a clinic is sending me a home pregnancy test which will come via UPS today any time after 9 A.M.   I was told that it would be better to take it first thing in the morning, but if it comes later should I wait to take it until Friday?      My sleeping schedules are off lately anyway, so my 'morning' doesn't come until after noon. Would it cause the same results waking up and taking it then compared to waking up earlier and doing it?

20090205012704AA84kUw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	And what if you have no choice but to be a neglectful parent?	There seems to be a great deal of things in society that are judged as 'black and white' and 'right and wrong' and yet it seems that so many of them have such huge variables that these calls cannot be made practically.      We've heard of those parents who work so much they neglect their child.  The community uproars and says 'You are a neglectful parent, you are bad, look at what you are doing to your child, look at how you are affecting them emotionally and psychologically.  Your child should come first, not a job, not money.  How despicable of you to let this happen.'      What if this parent is working 17 hour days just to make ends meet?  Just to make sure he and his daughter have a roof over their heads and can eat at least semi-properly.  He knows that if he does not work his *** off like this then the rent would not be payed and food would not be bought, they would live in subsidized welfare establishments or he would be on the street and his daughter would be taken away from him and put into a foster home.     He knows that a life in a low income neighborhood would be a horrible place for his daughter to grow up and she would not have the necessary comforts like good clothing and education and food and a healthy community.     He knows that even if he put her up for foster care there would be a risk of an unsafe environment, and the simple experience of being dragged away from her daddy and a loving home would ruin his little girl far worse than his not being able to read her bed time stories.   And yet every time he comes home late and she's waiting at the bottom of the stairs, and he has to hustle her to bed, she needs sleep for school, he sees this look of hurt and confusion in her young eyes. Every time he tells her he loves her but he won't be able to draw with her or take her to the park or do homework, that she should ask the babysitter, and she turns and walks away with a hanging head, and he can't do anything about it.     He tells her constantly that he loves her and he tells her he wishes he could spend more time with her but daddy needs to work or we won't be able to eat good food or have nice things or a nice place to live; she nods and says she understands but he knows she doesn't, that sort of thing doesn't make sense to children deep down inside.     He hugs her and kisses her cheek before running out the door, is it his imagination or is she more distant and stiff every time, is she looking at the floor for a reason?  It breaks his heart every time.      And yet he can't escape this cycle of poverty and people say he is a neglectful parent though that couldn't be further from the truth.     It is so easy to jump on the band wagon and judge people but what about those instances when there is no clear line?   What good is caused by the people who jump to conclusions without knowing the full story?    There is no quick, convenient, overall solution.
20090205014452AA8dTyu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	21 week old feeding/night sleeping routines?	Due to poor weight gain I was advised by my GP and health visitor to start weaning my daughter at the age of 17 weeks. She is now 21 weeks and is having 2 solid meals a day. She is a breastfed baby. She is back on track with her weight which is a good thing but I am interested to know what patterns/routines other breastfeeding mum's have once solids have been introduced. I have been cooking fresh foods from Annabel Karmel books and they are going down a treat.   She has only slept through the night on 2 occasions.   I have been reading books about this but it will be really helpful to see what other real people do so I can try different options.   Her (feeding) routine at the moment is   7:30am Breastfeed then baby rice (2tsp dried rice)   10:30am Breastfeed   1:30pm Breastfeed and baby puree (2 cubes)   4:30pm Breastfeed   7:30pm Breastfeed (By this point she cannot keep her eyes open and goes straight to bed.      She wakes up anytime between 10pm and 4am where I have been feeding her. Apart from earlier this week when she slept for 12 hours 2 nights running.       Should I be feeding her so frequently during the day or should I wake her at 10pmish to give her another feed. Do your breastfed babies go through the night? Should I be adding in another solid feed....AAARGGHH it's such a mine field so any suggestions would be welcome.       One more thing!! Because she has managed to sleep through the night a couple of times I came to the conclusion that she must be getting enough during the day which is why I ask about night feeds!       If you could give me some of your baby routines would be massive help. Thanks!

20090205014627AAplyqY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think Obama's success is evidence that the heterosexual nuclear family is over-rated?	A child needs a supportive and loving family, but not nescisarily a mother and a father. If someone can become the most powerful man on earth without having daddy around, i think that should be taken as a leson that we need to be more open minded about family structire.    An unmarried person is capable of raising a child so long as they have other family and social support. A lesbian or gay couple are probably able or rasing children with no more dificulty than any other couple.

He just turned 1, he engages in a lot of eye contact, he "talks" to me while looking at me, he knows how to indicate to me at dinner time if he wants a bite or a drink.  He brings toys to me that he wants to play with and he loves to play chase the baby.  The only two things that I'm worried about is that sometimes he doesn't respond to his name.  I've noticed he does this mostly when he's engrossed in something but it's still worrisome to me.  I don't know if perhaps i'm exaggerating.  Another thing is that he has not learned how to wave by.  Sometimes if I wave bye to him, he'll give me one short sharp wave, but not all the time.  Should I be worried?

20090204105753AAAZGAe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Speech delay in an 18 month old...is there something wrong?	I've just returned from my son's 18 month well check-up and I'm a wreck! The pediatrician seemed very concerned that my son has not spoken a single word yet and therefore, has recommended a speech pathologist. My son doesn't talk a lot, but when he does, it's repeated consonants, grunts, whining, etc.       I've always been the type of mom who is involved by helping practice walking, reading to him often, singing songs, labeling items, etc., so please note that an effort has been put forth and I haven't left him neglected.       Also, I've honestly always kind of wondered that there might be something different about him. He was slow in all physical aspects of development (sitting up at 7 months, crawling at 11 months and walking at 16 months). Not only that, but he just rather interesting to watch at play. He is OBSESSED w/ spining things (toys, turning over his cars and trucks, the wheels on his stroller, etc.) and is always really intregued by things (turning them over and over in his hands and I mean, really, examining them). He doesn't point or clap his hands, but he does give kisses w/ or w/o request.      I guess now that I've heard this speech concern from the doctor I'm even more worried that there's a chance that my son could have some form of autism. I was just wondering if anyone else has run into a similar situation and what the outcome was...otherwise, if anyone has further advice or recommendations. Thank you so much for your time!

20090204152616AA4zO9Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	I have noticed something about children who have been adopted, and I want to know what you think.?	At my high school, there are like 10 or 20 kids who have been adopted. What I have noticed about many of them (if you are adopted, I have nothing against you, and I am trying to refrain from using stereotypes) is that they seem to be odd, and somewhat "Messed up". What I mean is, some of them are insensitive, and in a way unorthodox. Could it be that they are this way because some parents cannot really love adopted children as if they were their own? I mean, my cousin is adopted, and he seems pretty average, but these people of which I speak are not exactly. Any thoughts?

The doc says it's his bodies natural way of getting rid of what is making him sick, and I understand that, but meanwhile, his sleep is disturbed and I give him some Triaminic with some Benadryl to help him rest at night, but his coughs are so harsh.  I feel his pain. And at night it seems to be worse because it's the time when you want to rest and your body is busy still coughing trying to get rid of all the ickies.

Any other remedies that you have found that work for your kiddos? Please share.      Thanks for the comfort. And sorry this was a bit long winded.

20090204215410AAF9pXD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Odd 2 1/2 year old tantrums?	My son is a sweet, mellow, reasonable little guy. For the past week, however, he has had several really scary meltdowns over "nothing" - tonight, for instance, I calmly told him not to throw a toy. He got so angry that he didn't know what to do with himself - he was writhing on the floor screeching and crying. He didn't want me to touch him - kept saying "no, momma". Nothing helped - the more I talked to him the angrier he got, and he didn't want me to hold him but he also didn't want to be put down. He kept walking from room to room (or while I was carrying him pointing all over the house wanting me to go there). He didn't know WHAT he wanted. I finally just put him in the bathtub and he calmed down (after throwing a few bath toys in anger). I thought he was going to hurt himself the whole time - he slammed his knees on the floor, etc. Does this sound familiar? Should I be worried? His meltdowns are so frequent and not because he isn't getting something he wants - I honestly don't know why he's so upset. He's good at communicating - it isn't that kind of frustration. He is scary to watch - like a little caged/enraged animal. Any thoughts? Thanks!

I love him and I want to be a complete agreement with him but then again it's me and that what i want. I don't want any more kids.        So should i tie my tubes at 22.  Yea i found a doctor that will do it. I just have to schedule.

20090204224737AAMmnA5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Early pregnancy symptoms before period due! I knew I was pregnant?	Hi everyone, I just found out through a blood test with the doc that I'm almost two weeks pregnant. I knew my body was telling me that & that it is possible to get symptoms 1 week before your period is due.   So to all the ladies out there wondering if you can get pregnancy symptoms before your period is due, the answer is yes, ya!   The first symptom I got was    -very tired   -sore boobs/pain in the boobs   -tiny amount of nausea which continued to grow slighty each day   -cramping   -waking up during the night for no reason   -cervical fluid more than usual after ovulation      Anyway I thought I'd let you ladies know if you were wondering the same thing, as I was asking everyone in here is it possible to get early pregnancy signs & some women were saying no alot.   I wish all you ladies who are trying to conceive all the best & hope you fall pregnant too. :0)

20090204213942AAGvbKA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Personal experiences with E.P.T. please?	I know that they say to wait until a couple days after your missed period to test but I am going crazy waiting! I'm not completely sure when my exactly period is due, I know between the 6th and 9th. I feel crampy like I am about to get my period and I have also felt like I have a fever on and off all day today. The weird thing is that I had cramps about a week and a half ago - like stronger cramps than I usually have. My question is if any of you have taken a pregnancy test (preferably E.P.T. brand) before you missed your period and gotten a positive result?       Please no rude answers, I know you guys can't tell me anything for sure. I just want a little peace of mind, I can't wait but don't want to waste a test for nothing.      Thank you!

20090204224237AABtqzR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What could cause nightly fevers?	my baby cousin i watch has been sick lately.    he started by having really bad stomach cramps/pain with a 103 fever upon waking one morning.  he was quickly brought to his pediatrician's office who drew blood and checked him out.  she ended up prescribing ibuproferen/pedialyte and some medicine for the stomach cramps.    the fever dropped to 100 over the next hour and stayed there for another hour.  the stomach ache went away completely.      by noon, he was asking for ice cream and running around happily.  but around 6, he started getting a fever again and complaining that his belly hurt.  he was given ibuproferen as directed.  it went down again for awhile but he started complaining of a belly ache again around midnight.      he woke up coughing (no more belly ache for now) and acting normal but quickly started getting feverish again.  he was given more ibuproferen as per doctors orders.  he was then brought back to the doctor to be looked at again.  she could find nothing wrong and suggested a virus was possible.    has anyone ever heard of this happening?  he is 3 if that helps.

20090204213726AA554Bd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My daughter hates washing her hair. Please help.?	My daughter is 3 years old. I'm wondering if this is common for some kids to fear washing their hair. The main problem is the water getting in her face and ears. She seems terrified the soap (or water) would hurt her eyes. I've explained to her the shampoo doesn't burn nor does the water but for a 3 year old - I 'm not sure she fully understands.       I've tried various methodes like having her tilt her head back or having her hold a wash cloth infront of her eyes. But the minute she feels the water get too close to her face (or ears) she starts panicking. I'm just at a lost what to do. At times she seems to be doing better but then we're right back where we started. Can anyone help with some tips if your child is experiencing the same thing?

20090204214639AAub2US	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do Adolescents Think? (Adolescent Certainty)?	Hello! I need your opinion this for my Education class. What do you think the term "adolescent certainty" means. A general idea of it provided by my professor is that it refers to “the idea that adolescents think they fully see the cause and effect or the magnitude of a situation when they really don’t but still are very sure they do.” So basically why is it that adolescents think they are fully capable of making adult-like decisions even though their cognitive capacities have yet to fully develop?      Also, do you have any examples of a situation during your adolescence where you were stubborn or hard-set in your way of thinking about a particular situation/idea, when in reality looking back there was lot more you could have considered? If so, what do you think made you change your thinking? Was it time? Experience? The school of hard knocks?  Education? Wisdom of others?      If you have some input or insight into this concept I would GREATLY appreciate a response from you. It would also be helpful if you included your name (first only is fine) and age so that I can compare answers. Please consider doing this for my class... I am desperate for interviews! :)      Thank you SO MUCH for your time!

20090204220238AAI0wNu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do I sound like I could be pregnant? Also question about Blood Testing?	Okay so for the last two days I've been having like a very small dot of blood on the tissue when i go pee. Its like not even noticeable, its super light pink with like the center being a bit darker...sort of, but not by much its still super light pink. Anyways. Last week I took a pregnancy test (too early maybe) and it was negative. I was constipated and so i started to freak out more than i was already. I already talked to my partner and he said there was no way he could see how i had could be pregnant. I don't even feel pregnant. except for that bit of blood. Which never lasts the whole day, and shows up the 2nd time i go pee that day. The day before the dots started, i went for a blood test. im at a university so they just got the results today. I made an appointment thinking i may have something wrong with me excluding the blood test. they said at the appointment the dr. would read the test result back to me...does this mean it came back positive? wouldn't they tell me right away if it was negative? Maybe this is how this clinic works though as the doctors are just drop ins and i don't know if the lady at the front desk is a RN. I have to pee alot when i drink juice, i had a like vending machine sized cranberry juice today spread out over like 3 hours. I seriously had to pee so much...i had the like urge to pee and i'd only pee like 3 drops.When I brushed my teeth this morning my gum between my front teeth bled a bit...which hasn't happened in a while. My period is due in like 2 weeks. And i've been off my other one for 17 days...any ideas. is this implantation? could my blood test be positive? im so so nervous...its driving me insane and making me miserable. i haven't eaten in like 3 days. My lower back also feels tense, on the day before i started spotting i had like really strong kidney pains and the next day they were gone totally. i also think i had a dot of like bright red blood early last week...when i say dot i litterally mean like smaller than a pin head. what does this mean? help!

20090204222735AAJVA6Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do you know your pregnant when you skipped your period for a month in the first place?	Could you get pregnant when you skipped a period? For example; your supposed to start around the 11th or 12th of the month. But AF never came.    Then like 20-26th. You had unprotected sex. (then spotting for a few hours like the 30th)      How do you know if you are pregnant or not when you skipped a period? Like when do you test?
20090204222810AAx6mzN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I ordered the "your baby can read" program?	I did some extra home tutoring so that I can gather up 200 bucks to buy this program. I don't believe in pressuring your baby or forcing them to learn or whatever.... but if you just  show ur baby some DVD's and read them the flashcards and they can get a headstart then i think its totally worth it...      but now im feeling bad because i feel everyone around me is looking down on me as if spending 200 dollars is a BIG waste of money and like telling me that "your baby cant even walk or talk on its own and ur buying it stuff to learn to read"       so how should i feel now

20090204223450AArqrEe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	If you were laid off, how did you handle your daycare situation?	If you really love your daycare provider like I do, how do you handle the dilemma of whether or not to keep your spot there in hopes of finding another job soon or saving much needed money?      I was laid off in December, and have kept my young girls in their daycare because they love their teacher so much, and I trust and adore her as well.  They're only going 2 days a week now but we are still paying full time rates as she is unable to extend us part time rates.  It's been almost 2 months and I still haven't found a new full time job.  But it would be extremely hard to even look for a job if I didn't have some time off during the week for searching, networking, interviewing etc.  I don't know how much longer it's going to take to find one and I don't know whether or not to continue our childcare there.  I'm torn...  There have been so many changes in our family life in 2008, that I'm so reluctant to remove their special teacher in my daughters' lives too.  We can make it work financially for now, but should I?  What would you do or what have you done already?      Thanks!

I totally took one for the team.    Had I not moved in the way of the ball it probably would have gone into the goal.       But I intercepted it with the inside of my thigh, a really sensitive place.   You can see where the lines of the seams of the ball hit. It looks like the ball cut me.        Its been 4 days since I got hit and the bruising has gone down but the seam imprint is looking more and more permanent, like a scar.       Could that actually happen?   Could getting hit extremely hard like that leave a scar or some sort of permanent mark?

Supposedly, you thread a needle and stick it in the eraser of a pencil and hold it over your wrist then it should swing in the direction of your palm if you are having a boy then the pencil will circle then repeat but it will swing across side to side for a girl then circle. Have any of you heard of this?

Cheeses's....or any place where it is to be expected but, why do I feel like a lone ranger in this?

We had sex prob. every night before she left for the beach on June 15th. I even came down to the beach for a day/night. On June 17th. We had sex and I came in her twice.       Well after i left.

They didn't use a condom, but he was a little tipsy. and kept falling asleep during the process.  He said he didn't nut at all. he barely had it in her cause he couldn't keep it up. So they stopped. She was very honest and told me everything. His story was even the same.      But after she came home. June 22nd. We started our relationship back. and we had sex a lot...

At 1am the  9 month old wakes up drinks about 6 oz. of formula and instantly drops back to sleep until 8-9am - just wondering if that sounds normal? What is the longest stretch of sleep a baby that age should have. I see no problem with the 1am feeding since she snoozes for 7-8 hrs. after going back to sleep from eating!       Just curious what others have to say. -      BTW: this baby is about 31"L and weighs 27lbs. she is and has always been in the highest percentile- so maybe she really needs the extra feeding!  She also takes only one nap  for 1 hour during the afternoon!       Thx. guys for the input ;)
20090204225804AAMI0gM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long should I wait to take a pregnancy test?	My husband and I just started trying this past month and although it's quick, I feel pretty sure that I'm pregnant.  My LMP was Jan 9 and I'm guessing my cycle is ~33 days (don't have much to base that on because I just got of bc a few months ago) so that would mean I ovulated ~ Jan 28th.  I started just "feeling" pregnant last weekend-and First sign was my breasts...they have been noticeably fuller since the weekend.  Then I started noticing an icky metal taste in my mouth yesterday, I feel more emotional, have had light headaches, felt crampy which doesn't usually start this long before my period, and I've been feeling more and more naseous over the past couple of days.

20090205005628AAIEQeS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Our 4 month old baby wakes up screaming every hour every night?	When our baby was about 2 months old, she started sleeping through the night with no problem at all.   She was happy, went to sleep easily and woke up smiling every morning around 6 - 7am.   Then at around 3 months she started waking up a lot during the night.   We moved her from her moses basket to a travel cot and then to her cot in the nursery during this time and during the day she was really happy with the new surroundings, but at night it was the same pattern..   Sleep for an hour, wake up, we put her dummy back and reassure her, sleep for another hour, wake up.....   More recently when she's been waking up, rather than just wimpering, she is starting to cry and scream until we go and settle her.   Im not even sure how awake she is as her eyes are often closed and we seem to settle her just by stroking her and putting her dummy back and she quietens down really easily.      But last night, it was every half hour, and she would scream and scream until we went and calmed her, sometimes with her dummy, sometimes just soothing her, but it doesnt last and she soon screams again...      I guess we're just not sure what to do...   She is suffering a bit with colic and reflux and she is heavily teething (I think shes in the wars a little bit!) so Im not sure if its that that's bothering her, but we give her various things to sooth them, none of which make any difference at night.      I've read about night terrors, but they seem a little more extreme than what she is currently displaying, I hope....      Could it be separation anxiety? Teething? Bad dreams? Bad parenting??      We are running on empty, getting about 1 hours solid sleep every night and kinda need to break the cycle somehow...      Help?!!

20090205035416AAiv8pz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Food stamp question..?	So, I am reading an article on yahoo news and it was talking about how people can not feed their families with the food stamps they get each month..        One mother talked about how some days she will only eat crackers and cheese so her boys will have something to eat.. or the single man that sometimes goes days with out lunch so he will have enough food to last all month long.      there were other family's on there that did the same thing      The thing I found the STRANGEST was that the mother of the boys, both teenager got about 450$ a month in food stamps and the single man 350$ a month and there is only him to feed..      I get 150$ a month in food stamps and I have my grandson and his father at my house and we eat very well,,and NO it is not all TV dinner and snack food.. my grandsons father is a some what 'stay at home' dad so he does most of the cook for all three of us,, I do the food shopping.       Am I wrong to think that some (NOT ALL) people on food stamps are just not buying and/or cooking the right foods.. How can a mother of three NOT be able to feed her family on almost 500 dollars a month?

The last time I was pregnant was 9 years ago and times have changed. I have been into New look and Mothercare and managed to buy 1 pair of jeans. Im only 8 weeks pregnant but after having 2 children previously my tummy seems to be sore when I wear my normal jeans. Yesterday I bought some over the bump jeans from Mothercare. However I was shocked to find the price of them. ￡30 for something that wont last 7 months. Ive looked on ebay and there is nothing that I like on there. My partner and I have 4 children between us already so you can imagine how tight money is. Im already in a size 16 normal clothes and 18 maternity clothes so I want something that will smooth any unsightly other bumps out!!! Im also big breasted too. 38G so any info on maternity tops that don't make me look like Im spilling out all over the place is greatly appreciated.      Thanks for all your answers.

20090205030553AABpVwe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think it's appropriate to?	Slap your kid across the face when they do something wrong.       Now, I am anti-spanking but if you have to, fine, a couple swats is perfectly acceptable for say a 7 year old.       But would you ever slap a teenager across the face for say..mouthing off or being disrespectful?   Do you see it as a suitable form of punishment?      I see it as crappy parenting and I think it shows a great deal of stupidity on the parents part. It shows they are real podunk at heart and don't know much more than to hit when angry or when punishing.       I think that slapping a teenager across the face is really stupid  and that they are better ways to handle a mouthy or disrespectful teenager.          What do you think?

20090205045646AAx6myf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Any advice for a mum with a "clingy" child?	My little girl, 8, is going through a clingy phase. She has cried a little before school, I've been in and the teacher is aware, she even made her "star of the week" to help her confidence.   Last night she said she is worried about growing up and having to leave me ~ I said she didn't have to leave if she didn't want to, just to settle her, as obviously when she's older that'll change.   Its cute, but her sister wasn't like this. She is OK when with her mates, I've observed her, she has fun, and has a nice group of friends.   I don't know why it happens, I have to work, so I do not keep her off school when she cries, unless ill of course.   I worry, plus her crying last night made me feel sad/ill almost.

20090205023926AAlgRLn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Teenage parenting? Your input?	I see too many teen parents getting bashed on on here. Not all teen mothers are smoking, drinking, sleep around type people. Most people just jump to the conclusion that the teen is pregnant because she couldn't keep her legs shut while she was drunk. I am 16, i am not pregnant but i have had a pregnancy scare before. I have never smoked or been drunk. The worst i have done is trying different kinds of alcohol, and i hated all of it. I am pulling a 96% average in school, and i am graduating high school early this summer. Like i said before, i have had a pregnancy scare before but i have only been with the guy that i am with right now and he has been my boyfriend for 9 months now. He is as good of a kid as i am too, he's 19. We both have jobs working at restaurants and he is going to college as well right now. Also, if by chance i were to fall pregnant sometime, i would take responsibility for my actions and raise my child. I would take my child in as a blessing and see my pregnancy for the beauty in which it really is. I mean, it would be hard to be pregnant at this point in time, but i would not just give up on my child and rant about it like i see a lot of teens do. I guess what i am asking is, why do people look down on ALL teenage parents??

I have a child from a previous relationship and we are both in our twenties. We have both noticed that he has very little semen when he ejaculates (a few drops at best) and there are often little lumps in it. It is also very thick. We eat well (he's home for all three meals) and we drink lots of water as our beverage. We have experimented with how often we have sex, from twice a week to three times a day. Nothing has changed his semens appearance.       We also track my ovulation and have sex at the right time.      My question is...Has anyone had luck getting pregnant with only a few drops of semen, and has anyone found out their husband was sterile?

20090204191415AALIyzK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did you notice less taxes taken out of your check after you had a baby and claimed them on your W2?	I just started back to work part-time. It's my first time working since my son's been born (he's 18 months).      I claimed him on my taxes (my W2) and I noticed that a LOT less taxes were taken out of my check than there was 2 yrs. ago before he was born. The ONLY thing that changed on my W2 was having a child to claim as a dependent.    Did anyone else notice a LOT less taxes taken out of your paycheck after having a child (and claiming them on your W2 form)?

20090204191526AAdsYFy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	About my baby eating rice cereal?	Ok. So i just started feeding my baby rice cereal he just turned 5 months. He is not interested at all with it and he doesn't care to eat from a spoon. I don't know what to do to make him interested i keep telling him if he hurries up and learns to eat it well from a spoon then he can move on to the good stuff. lol   Anyways, how long does it take for them to learn to eat from a spoon? My lil one has no patience he wants it quick and he wants it now. lol   Do you have any ideas on what i can do? How long did it take your baby to get the hang of it? I've even tried feeding him half his bottle first then the rice cereal but it seems like any ideas i can come up with just doesn't work. What did you do?
