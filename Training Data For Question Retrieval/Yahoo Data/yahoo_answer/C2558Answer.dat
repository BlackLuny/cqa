When you drop the pan if you buy 6 qts you should have enough with some to spare, just keep checking the stick after you get 4 qts in it and start the car and let it warm up and shift the car through the gears a few times while sitting and keep rechecking the level until you get it filled.|`|66e8976b6d841286e506d4ec5394ee46aa	I think you have the wrong parts, likely because of your terminology.  Valve cover gaskets, on a V6, would come in pairs.  A pan gasket, properly called an oil pan gasket, goes on the oil pan on the bottom of the engine.  As you have a transversely mounted engine, the transaxle (transmission) pan is also under the engine bay, but on the transaxle instead of on the engine.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you are trying to change the transmission fluid.  You need a transaxle pan gasket, transaxle filter, and likely about three quarts of transmission fluid.|`|p39mloh4aa	On a v6 engine, you should have two valve cover gaskets.<br>  The oil pan gasket would be larger, it would get installed on the bottom of the engine. If you drop the transmission pan and drain the torque converter (if accessible) I would fire the car back up on 5-6 quarts of fluid. Then add fluid until full by checking the dipstick.|`|wSFiPw78aa	Yeah its fine to have a little bigger as long as you matched the gasket up with all the bolt holes your fine.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Do you mean a 250 2 stroke or 4 stroke? If you mean 4 stroke, then yes go with the 250. It is a far superior machine compared to the 125 but you will also pay for that superiority. If you mean 2 stroke, then it just depends on how much power you want. The 250 2 strokes are very fast machines. There is nothing wrong with a 125 MX bike but the 250F is just much easier to ride and can turn faster lap times. The corner speed is where the 250F really puts a hurting on the 125. Some will tell you the 250F is expensive to maintain but that is just not true. It will cost twice as much to rebuild as the 125 but you'll do it half as often if not less. The great thing about the 250F is that it's almost like having 2 different bikes. You can run it at high RPM's and just scream around the track, or you can lug it around the woods at very low RPM's without stalling or fouling plugs. The 250 2 stroke will also give much more versatility than the 125. If you go for the 250 2 stroke get the YZ250 and don't even waste your time looking at anything else. It is the most awesome 2 stroke MX bike on the planet. Also there is no real difference in the physical size of a 125 versus a 250. There is not enough weight difference to notice and in many cases the 125 is actually a little taller than the 250.|`|r3K7wbLlaa	It depends on the place you want to ride them.<br>  <br>  In the desert, almost anything will do.

But if this is your first bike like it sounds get a 250 4 stroke, u won't be disappointed.|`|d7769476217737e47fe0892141eebc84aa	well it depends on 2stroke or 4 stroke.  a 125 2stroke is about the same as a 250 4 stroke, and a 250 2 stroke is about the same as a 450 4 stroke. i have YZ250 2 stroke and I'm faster on trails and tracks then my body who has a RM450 4 stroke also know as 450F.  go big ill tell you that. everyone i know who buys the small bike first always, less than a year getting a bigger bike.  don't buy an RM go <br>  KX250 or KX250F or KX450F<br>  or CR250F or CR450F<br>  or YZ250 or Yz450F, the only thing you have to worry about the 2 strokes is 2007 is the last year most companys will make a 2 stroke dirt bike.

Start out in 2nd gear to get going before moving back in drive (or upshift).  And go real light on the gas pedal.  OD is overdrive & doesn't kick in until you reach highway speed.  Appears you haven't had much experience driving in the snow.  I spent a winter in Maine & drove thru the NH mountains, Vermont & up to Montreal without any problems with a rear wheel car.|`|k6rfhP05aa	How are your tires?  If you can barely get moving, sounds like you are on a bald or summer tire.  First and foremost, get a good pair of snow tires.  Second, when the white stuff is deep, switch to a lower gear and go slow, especially when coming down a hill or incline.       O/D, or overdrive, will kick your engine over to a higher gear when you're cruising along.  If your are driving in snow, you're not going to get to those speeds anyways.  Keep it slow, you won't have to worry about O/D.    Edit.  You are saying this is a brand new car with new tires, but you indicate a 2007 Ford?  That is two years old in my book.  Also, you didn't mention the model?  So I will take a stab and guess.  The 500, Taurus, Fusion and Freestar come in SEL models.  The OEM tires these models use have received very poor reviews for snow traction according to tire rack.  So again, your OEM tires are the reason you have zero traction, regardless of their age.  My advise, get some good snow tires or better all-season tires.

I would advise you to take it to a garage because otherwise you may have a serious problem could get worse. I know people in the motor trade who have been asked to sort out problems that were left for so long that they were irreparable.     It shouldnt cost too much to get it checked out. Ask the mechanic to look it over and maybe take it for a short test drive and then tell you what they found out so that you can decide whether or not you want to spend money on the car, if needed.    Of course it may be that the problem can be fixed within a matter of minutes and will cost almost nothing at all, or even that the car is just struggling to cope with the weather we have had recently.|`|fij4cX5haa	Sounds like there's gum in your transmission.

KegxJHn5aa	Believe it or not, I discovered this quite a bit ago. Right when I turned 14, I was told I could take my Learners Permit test at the DMV, but I didn't listen to them at the time.    I don't have a unique experience with this specific situation, but I acquired my Learners Permit at 15. I'm fairly sure that 14 years of age is the point where you can actually take the Learners Permit test in Florida, but you have to pass that Drug, Alcohol, & Controlled Substances test before you even enter the DMV. It was mandatory for me, but I took that as part of a homeschooling assignment on www.flvs.net.    I would give it a try if you really need it, but make sure that your parents have your Social Security card and real birth certificate, or else they won't give you the Learners Permit at the end of it all.    If you want a summary of my diagnosis, yes. I am fairly sure you can earn your Permit at 14. Just make sure you have all of your bases covered first, or else you're going home disappointed.

The piston ring lands must be in perfect condition. The piston skirt clearance must be within tolerance. the end gaps of the rings have to be ground and matched. Six cylinder motors are noted for cylinder wall wear because of the long stroke. If you have over 200,000  miles on the motor the cylinders should be bored and honed the least amount to clean them up. That will mean new fitted pistons to complete the job. The rods should be re-conditioned so that the big ends are perfectly round again.    Save yourself and buy another car.

Call your agent|`|0B0ycKw3aa	Hello there:)    If you are a young driver attempting to find cheap and affordable car insurance you are probably already aware of the challenge that lies ahead. The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.

hktfe1UGaa	There is nothing more that I can say that the first person that answered already has said. He pretty much summed it all up. They are 2 different aircraft, and are used in different ways. Give that guy the 10 pts, nice answer Chief.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	Which is better the 737, or 777...    Depends on what you use it for!!!!!!!|`|wveAbByxaa	It's really not fair to ask a question like that about ANY aircraft in the DOD  inventory.  What I mean by that is that each aircraft is designed for a specific purpose.  The B-1B is a high speed bomber with a large payload capacity.  The B-2 is a low speed bomber with a small payload capacity, however it has stealth characteristics.  The B-1 is made to drop bombs at a faster speed but with more munitions, and the B-2 is made to go in un-noticed, drop a couple of precision guided munitions to take out radar and such, and then get out so that other aircraft can come in and finish the job, i.e. B-1, F-16, F-15E, A-10 etc.    I wasn't sure how to add another comment so I am just editing my original content.  Threesheve is correct.  I had the two "stealths" mixed up.  I am a fighter crew chief and have been for 18 years now and know a lot about fighters and a little about heavies/bombers.  Threesheave set me straight though.  Thanks!|`|VhhEz92Oaa	I agree that the comparison of the two aircraft can't be valid as to which is better, but I also have to mention that both are heavy bombers.    As the first answer mentioned, that "the B-2 is made to go in un-noticed, drop a couple of precision guided munitions to take out radar and such, and then get out so that other aircraft can come in and finish the job".    That is simply not true.  I think he confused the role of the F-117 which was made to do just that, but the B-2 Spirit can carry 80 Mk-82 bombs while the B-1 can carry 81.    Yes, the B-1 has a higher payload capacity and also has provisions for external stores, but that doesn't make the B-2's capacity small by any means.    Both aircraft were designed with the same basic mission, heavy bombing, but one is fast and non-stealthy, the other slow and has low observability.    Which is better?  The Air Force would rather have more B-2's than B-1's, and they should know more about it than we do.  You decide.

tOgxkYkKaa	As your car is driving, it pushes the air out of the way... wind resistance, of course.  As it does this, it creates a pocket of low pressure directly behind the vehicle.  Now, as the car stirs up all the dust and dirt it gets caught up into the air surrounding the car.  When the  air carrying the dust comes to the back of the car where the low pressure is, the low pressure pulls this in and because the surface of the rear of the car has no wind brushing against it so its able to come to rest there.|`|FTpy9M8raa	look out the back window as the car moves the air in front it cause a vaccumn behind it   walla  dust dirt and what not

sCqdisvnaa	BMW keys include a transponder which is recognised by the EWS (anti-theft) system in the car.  They must be ordered from a dealer, and you need to provide proof of ownership (bring your registration in when you place the order).      Buying a key from EBay works only if you have a transponder chip available to retrofit into it, or if you only want the key to open the doors, but not actually start the car.    Since the 740 keys include the alarm remote, the cost is fairly high.  Expect around $80-$120.  Call a couple of dealers to see which one near you has the best price.|`|8oG11Mq4aa	Here is a new uncut one on ebay motors:    http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/BMW-7-SER...
Ty32khkaaa	They probably didn't do the oil filter right. They leak if they forget to remove the old gasket. Other than that it could be a few things. Keep an eye on it.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you either have bad rings or you have a very bad oil leak like maybe the rear main seal. you won,t have any oil pressure if it,s dry.|`|EVZ8rO2waa	Synthetic oil is great for your engine but it is better to start using it when the engine is new because synthetics have a much lower viscosity than conventional oils & they will seep out of any weak or worn out seals or gaskets. Check under your car for any leaks after you have driven the car several miles to warm it up. If you continue to use or lose oil, your best bet is to switch back to conventional oil with a higher viscosity.|`|120795afd4e1011681d5fd1a51b845a9aa	The smoke could be caused by a possible head gasket leak, if you are in a warm climate. If is cold enough outside when you first start your car you will see a small smoke cloud due to the difference in temperatures.   The oil pressure dropping is mostly like an oil leak somewhere in your system. Several possibilities, oil filter, oil drain plug, oil pan gasket, valve cover gasket, head gasket. You should have a shop check for oil leaks and also check your coolant level and condition.  The oil leaks could be a result of switching to FULL Synthetic oil if the previous owner only ran conventional oil in the motor. There is nothing wrong with conventional oil. It is just that FULL synthetic oil is structurally smaller and can leak past prvious built up residue from the old oil. I would highly recommend having a shop check for oil leaks first and possibly a head test to check your head gasket.  Hope this helps.

AA11719714	There is no clear cut answer.  You just call a few insurance company agents that represent different companies in the yellow pages ask for a quote.

YGfUK7s2aa	Different lifts for different uses. If you want to make your truck look like it could run over these little "rice rockets", go with the body lift. it will give your truck a look of being huge while at the same time saving your tire treadlife. if you want serious off-road performance, go with the suspension lift. this will seriously cut your ties' treadlife down while on the street, ut it will also give the extra clearance for going over obsticles at your favorite rock-crawling, or mudding hole.|`|AA11316085	this question requires a long answer, so ill say this ,DONT do a body lift, it fuks everything up.|`|uAe51LgDaa	Yeah the answer is BIG and so i would lyk to suggest you to refer this site ... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blogs.americantruckbuyer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogs.americantruckbuyer.com</a><br>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.truckstopunlimited.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.truckstopunlimited.com</a><br>  <br>  At those above sites u will hv to search 4 ur needful but am sure u will get it for sure...<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  Puneet M

q3XHbOSdaa	I would go with a Honda TRX90. You don't want to get one of those cheap ones that you get $450.00, because when it breaks down, you will have a hard time getting parts for it and finding someone that will work on it for you. A Honda TRX90 has a MSRP of $2749, but you can get it cheaper than that I'm sure. They have electric start and come with a 6 month factory warranty with the option of buying an extended warranty.|`|KyplSe66aa	Sounds like the governor is on.

729xSGMMaa	In Australia we got the F5i for a year or two but it's now been discontinued with no replacement.<br>  <br>  Back in the day, the 600F was the mid-sized sportsbike in the range.  Honda needed a more track-oriented machine but didn't want to sacrifice the rideability and versatility of the 600F, so they released the 600RR and sold it alongside the 600F.  The RR is a great track bike, and these days race wins and horsepower generate a lot more reviews and sell a lot more bikes than comfort or city/highway rideability, so the market has shifted.|`|j9VOwWblaa	Every ride the RR?  The F4i was an in-between bike and I believe the sales were starting to drop.|`|FTpy9M8raa	cause it was an old model and maybe thy might be comming out with a replacement next year
729xSGMMaa	Firsting, of the gear shapper cages the taking to off.   Then for shapper cutter easy out.  Next to grinding wheel commute and shapper cutter grinding begin.  Grinding to shapper cutter limits for sure! Otherwise new gear shapper cages, new shapper cutter, many shekels and again to start!  Finally shapper cutter replaced and gear shapper cages back in the seat.  Not to last the breaking of free play.  Luck more better!|`|HKd0klSkaa	"how to grinding the gear shapper cutter?"<br>  <br>  I wish I knew what language to answer this in. I think it might have to do with an automobiles transmission.

k3jKO3Y0aa	The squealing is just because the brake pads are new--that will probably go away. They should make good on anything that is wrong with the repair they did--however, they never promised you a rose garden. See if you can get them to explain the  feeling of looseness and the rattling. If the wheels feel loose I guarantee it is not the brakes.  Ask them to drive it if they haven"t already. ''Something" is a little vague for a description of what they replaced. But if $400 was the total bill for tires and brakes plus something, then the something could not be very much.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	if they didn't fix it right the first time keep taking it back until it's fixed right, they should not charge you for something they didn't do right the first time.|`|AA10705471	Since your family has been going their for a long time, I'm sure they will fix what ever is wrong, with out charging you, as long as it was something they already fixed. Now, could it be something else has gone bad...sure, and your going to have to trust them to explain that. The squealing could be from putting "after market " brake pads or shoes on, they sometimes do that...squeal. You might ask them to put brand name, or original equipment pads on, but they will want to charge you for the new pads...it's up to you, how much does the noise bother you?. Next time you have brakes replaced, ask for original equipment parts, they may cost you a little more, but you get what you pay for. The rattle could be anything, a rock in the hub cap, or something loose, have them check it good, and make sure they tightened the lug nuts , that is a common problem.|`|AA11172882	have them show you what they did each time and explain what it is and does and why they did it<br>  <br>  and if you are still not confident you can take it to another shop...but be careful how you interpret what you are told by the other place....they may say a part is bad but if needed you can wait a short time|`|AA11454796	as the owner of a repair shop i suggest taking it back & calmly insist on taking the mechanic for a ride in the car. while driving, explane what you're feeling when you say "it feels like somethings loose". try to re-create the symptom or concern while he's in the car, & point out the noise when you hear it. especially if they've been good to you in the past. there are still alot of shops out there who really do have your best interest at heart.|`|Vd8SlFzsaa	take it back you have to give them 1 more try to fix it and they should not charge you to fix what you already paid for..<br>  then if it is still not right take it to another shop and have them look at it and tell you if all the repairs were done right.
g22PY2tgaa	most vehicle HVAC systems have doors that are controlled by actuators to direct the air to different areas depending on how youve set the controls. they redirect flow to the windshield, floor, etc.  sometimes in older vehicles these doors get stuck or the actuators stop working.  usually this is not a cheap fix since you may have to disassemble a good portion of the i/p to get necessary access.|`|afba51cd96d4e89b842a67184cc3332baa	Maybe you forgot to open up the vents|`|HiPuiRe3aa	the flaps that control the vents are usually vaccum controled to open the proper ones as you turn the dial to chose top or bottom or whatever.

dlurym9Naa	pueden ser varias cosas, la primera es verificar que la manguera que se desconecta tenga la abrazadera que sirve para mantener la manguera en su lugar; otra podria ser que algun empaque interno al girar tape la tuberia y esta ejerza demasiada presion y por consiguiente la expulsion de la manguera...chequea lo anterior, mas creo que no ha de tener la abrazadera...suerte...|`|AzMVRu0Oaa	otra cosa puede ser la  bomba de la direccion, lleva una valvula de alivio que a determinada precion la libera para no exederse, si esta da?ada, puede ser que por eso te bote las mangueras. . . .|`|00c61b986152c82573c6c3fcde75e346aa	Mi esposo que es mecanico dice que es la manguera de succion, que le esta entrando aire al sistema o que la manguera de presion no es la correcta.|`|RLwXwqCPaa	cambea las abrazaderas y asegurate de que este el nivel de aceite bien. Usa la abrazadera correcta dependiendo del diametro de la manguera.  Cambia la de precion alta y precion baja ambas.  Asegura que pongas el aceite indicado en tu manual y no uno diferente. Suerte.
xQfcW8TTaa	que tal amigo, como muchos dicen, tienes que checar tu radiador. te recomiendo que quites manguera superior e inferios y con una pistola a presion (o como le llaman: karcher) lo limpiez bien bien y luego drenas todo el anticongelante y le metes nuevo. si con eso no se soluciona, pude y que la junta de tu cabeza este flameada, que quiere decir esto, que esta rota en alguna union de los cilindros con la cabeza, provocando que la temperatura del cilindro pase al agua y genere altas temperaturas, pero mejor primero prueba con el radiador, porque para cambiar la junta lo debes de llevar con alguien que ajuste motores.a y como dice mi amigo de arriba, en cuestion de la presion, compra  un nuevo tapon de radiador y ponselo a ver que pasa.suerte amigo!!!!!!|`|JlkoA6LCaa	yo tuve ese problema y resulto ser unos cables que hacian corto, te recomiendo lo lleves con un electrico a que le revise el sistema|`|RLwXwqCPaa	Bueno en vista de que ya cambiaste todo. Yo te recomendaria antes de que compres el radiador que fueras a la autopartes  y compraras un liquido para chequear el empaque de tus cabezas. Es facil de usar esta prueba. El liquido va a ser verde y si cambia de color eso significara que tu problema va estar en el    empaque de las cabezas.  Suerte . oh se me paso decirte que pongas un ojo a la tapon del radiador muchas veces este no guarda la precion y por eso se calientan los carros tambien no se si ya cambiaste esta.|`|Xl2HOrWjaa	la unica forma es esa: llevandolo a un experto en radiadores.<br>  <br>  revisa  bien tus niveles de aceite y anticongelante. y tambien que nada obstruya la parrila. ( en altas velocidades se supone que el motor se debe enfriar, sobre todo en bajadas).<br>  <br>  asegurate de que realmente el motor se esta sobnrecalentando y que el indicador no te esta enga?ando. (tal vez es lo que falla)<br>  <br>  para checar que el radiador falla lo puedes checar encendiendo el motor y dejando que el ventilador se accione cuando llegue a su temperatura. Pero aun asi, no sabrás si el anticongelante está llegando correctamente. <br>  <br>  la neta.... ahi si ya no sé. ponme como la peor respuesta.|`|IBCyk864aa	SI YA CAMBIASTE TODO........PORQUE NO CAMBIAS DE AUTO?|`|1d24678208f93331fc3d83e3535b9221aa	?El bulbo se acciona y funciona el ventilador?<br>  <br>  Purgá todo el recorrido del agua.|`|6d258125cf3b7b831452b4805422903aaa	arregla el radiador de seguro que eso es.|`|9c56f78e9c620c3245cfc2b0595ea205aa	Supongo que si el electroventilador, el termostato y el sensor funcionan deberias controlar el radiador, primero antes de desarmar asegurate que las entradas de aire que tiene el radiador estan limpias seria extra?o que en un modelo 2005 ya este tapado el radiador.<br>  Ahora antes de tocar nada haz lo suguiente por que estoy pensando que el problema no esta en nada de eso, saca la tapa del radiador con el motor en marcha y observa si aparecen burbujas estoy sospechando que la junta de la tapa de cilindros se quemó y es por eso que te calienta|`|ZyiesnBGaa	pues fijate de tu radiador q no este tapado  y usa anticongelante y checa el tiempo del motor y partes mecanicas posiblemente algun cable tambien sea lo q falla es igual q el atlantic o el pointer se calientan mucho|`|be14cdc65ccad4de4490430c76c20ac2aa	Amigo, mejor vendelo y te compras el mio:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mx.autocosmos.com/autos/usados/clasificado.aspx?cid=17059815" rel="nofollow">http://www.mx.autocosmos.com/autos/usado...</a><br>  <br>  Perfectas condiciones????

qVkKKlMnaa	I don't believe there is a shut off switch it just runs really bad until you put more oil in.  I ran mine really low once and it sounded like an old V8 until I put more oil in then it ran like a champ.<br>  <br>  Also really depends on which motor you have my experience is with the 4.3 not the other motor.|`|AA10978238	yes it does.<br>  <br>  if you start the engine and the computer doesnt see oil pressure after 5-10 seconds it kills the engine to save it from oil starvation.<br>  <br>  Greg S, you obviously dont know jack **** about these trucks.<br>  they have 2 oil pressure sending units, 1 for the guage the other to read pressure to kill the engine if there isnt any.|`|A0jaUxSlaa	Cars  do not generally have a shut off switch for low oil  that would create a dangerous condition if it were to shut off in the middle of the highway or something.  There should be a light to alert you to the fact that oil pressure is too low.|`|QZOjadG4aa	Most cars only have the low oil pressure light on them. The service engine soon light comes on sometimes. <br>  <br>  I have seen cars running on virtually no oil and it makes you wonder why there's no "kill" switch when you hit a certain volume but this is most likely for liabilty reasons. If it malfunctioned someone would sue or the oil was low but the car was driveable and they needed to get some place regardless of the oil level they'd sue. <br>  <br>  Most cars will run for quite awhile with no oil. This is helpful if you hit something in the road and split the oil pan. <br>  <br>  What typically happens is the friction between the piston and the cylinder walls reaches a point where the friction wins and the engine stalls. This doesn't mean the engine is totalled but on a very old engine that has had low oil pressure for many years the rings might fuse to the cylinder walls when or if there is no oil pressure. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ccac0420fe0ac5521b5db15ffc8bd579aa	The oil pressure sending unit supplies power to your fuel pump after the ecm stops supplying power.In other words, when you start the engine, the computer powers the fuel pump.After the engine starts,the oil pressure sending unit keeps the fuel pump powered and the computer turns off it's power to the pump.The idea is that if your oil pressure drops,the fuel pump will quit.They can cause low fuel pressure because they dont supply enough current to run the fuel pump at full speed.|`|vJ1sVkY6aa	yo jeffyukon i got some bad news pal the oil sending unit doesn't keep your fuel pump running it simply is a back up power source for the fuel pump in case the fuel pump relay goes bad when it hits around 30psi the fuel pump will turn on.I will bet you anything you want you can start any gm you like and break off the oil sending unit and the car will run

AA12364879	Depending on whether or not you mean clicked once when the key was turned, or clicked repeatedly, there are a few possibilities:<br>  1. The battery is bad and not holding a charge.<br>  2. The alternator is bad and not charging the battery.<br>  3. The starter is going bad and needs to be replaced.<br>  4. An electric item has malfunctioned and is draining the battery as the vehicle sits.<br>  5. One of the battery cables is loose or worn.<br>  6. The wires are loose on the starter solenoid.<br>  7. One of the ignition wires has been rubbing against a solid surface and it is creating a short or open circuit where the casing has rubbed off.<br>  8.

Take connectors off and clean them and the battery posts.  Try again.  If your interior lights are dim your battery is dead which could be a bad battery or alternator not charging.  If you have good lights and the click you get when you try to start it is a loud one than you probably have a starter problem.  A lot of weak clicks is a weak battery or connection.  If you disconnect the battery make sure you run it for 10 minutes after it does get started to reset the computer before you shut it off again.

2c6dca00af5416fdb5b3970d9b634144aa	It could be, but the price of Acetone is pretty high, and I'm not sure you could benefit that much from it.  Acetone is not too friendly with some plastics and/or rubber, so I think I would worry about the after effects of putting it in the vehicle.  It may not hurt a thing, and may do the trick, but one must consider what after effects shows up a year down the road?  To be honest with you, I can really see nothing it would hurt, but who knows?  It certainly brings forth more questions than answers at the present.<br>  Good Luck!!!<br>  Part 2:<br>  Look at this logically; if this was the answer for getting amazing gas mileage, does it not make sense that this would be the best idea to come along since sliced bread?  If somethig sounds too good to be true, then it usually is.  Acetone is made from a petroleum base, and the cost of burning it in your engine would be much more than gasoline.  I just don't see how this could be practical, economical, or mechanically safe.  Some stuff will burn a hole through your pistons if you burn it in an internal combustion engine by itself.  Acetone does burn really well, and has a higher octane rating than gasoline, but I can see it burning the pistons up after a while due to it burning much hotter than gasoline.  This is the main ingredent in injector cleaner, and you can only burn a small bottle of this stuff with a full tank of gas.  This makes sense, because Acetone is very explosive, and could in fact cause major engine damage if it is not regulated as to how much is injected into an engine.  I have burned Acetone in an engine to clean the injectors, but no more than 20 seconds, due to the extreme heat it produces .  Nitro will burn better and get super mileage, but like Acetone, it's not practical.|`|770511c6b2d73609f5a1c6ede2431b45aa	i didnt check those links, but that sounds dangerous to me. nail polish contains acetone. nail polish is flammable. flammable plus gas just doesnt sound good for some reason.|`|AA11205814	yes|`|AA11584218	I wouldn't.

The biggest problem I would worry about is the introduction of foreign additives that your engine is not designed for. I can see where acetone may keep varnish, sludge and carbon deposits cleaned out, but will it damage valves, pistons and change detonation over time? <br>  <br>  It probably wouldn't hurt to try it, but I wouldn't take the risk.<br>  <br>  You can drastically lower your fuel bill by putting water in your tank. Won't go anywhere, won't need gas either, but that's also not a good idea!|`|40635462c3f52e8086ec4974910b4061aa	Adding a gallon of Coleman fuel dramatically increases fuel mileage. We ran out of gas in the middle of the night in the desert.<br>  A sign in front of us said 28 miles to the nearest town. We'd been camping and the only thing we had as fuel, was Coleman lantern fuel. I thought, it wouldn't last very long, but, at least we'd be closer to the town before we ran out again. We made it all the way to town and to a service station on a gallon of fuel, without running out of gas. <br>  This was in 1977.<br>  This was a 75 Chevy Caprice Classic with 4 passengers, 350 V-8 engine, pulling a pop-up camper.

It was one of the worst things I had ever driven I would even rate it below the LDV flatbed I drive at work and that was a really bad drive. Not only that, it felt cheap & flimsy & was one of the most comedy handling cars I have ever driven not to mention the fact that it is simply ugly. For tax purposes I guess that it's ok, for reliability you will be screwed however. Remember FIAT stands for Fix It Again Tomorrow.

With 99000 miles on the clock it's probably avoided the dreaded head gasket problem that affects a lot of MG's & Rovers. Still ￡1400 is probably just a little much for it though. I would haggle it down a few quid!<br>  <br>  Obviously the major thing to look for is the head gasket problem, look around the oil filler cap & if you see white stuff or gunk that doen't look like oil, walk away! Other problems include the subframe being quite weak, look for slightly misaligned wheels as it could indicate a knock to the front that hasn't been fixed properly. I once had a similar problem to that when my friend crashed my 214Si (similar in every way except the lights at the front) into a lamp post, even though it was nothing more than a light tap the chassis & subframe were still bent to the point where the car had to be scrapped! Later Rovers & MG's aren't known for rust problems so that should be ok. The only other problems that you may encounter are down to build quality i.e. loose trim etc. Other than that The MG ZR / Rover 25 / Rover 214 is quite a reliable car!|`|2Q4C0f5Raa	Check the head gasket, common problem with the K-Series engine. The 1.4 is usually the least affected of the range but it will probably still go at some point. <br>  <br>  To check it; Open the header tank and look in the water for unusually discolouration and then open the oil filler and check in there for thick white emulsion.<br>  <br>  If it needs doing you've got a few quid to spend. I'd say if the car is a 2002 or newer it's not a bad price for you.
b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	It could simply be crap in the coolent system causing your problem in the water, it might be an idea to drain the coolant flush the system & put new coolant back in(ensuring there are no airlocks in the system). Once you have done that you should keep an eye on the coolant and oil to see if the gunk reappears. If it doesn't and the car doesn't seem to use up too much oil (every car uses a little) then you should be safe. The other problem with it cutting out could be a whole multitude of problems though. The first (and least expensive) port of call should be the fuel filter and fuel pump, replacing that ensures that the car is getting adequate fuel flow to the injectors. The next thing to check is the sensors & then finally the ECU itself. Thankfully the car will tell you exactly what's wrong with once you have it hooked up to a diagnostic computer at a garage. |`|TEUilsbHaa	Like the other guy said....try draining the cooling system out first and<br>  see if that helps.(don`t forget to refill it).As for the engine cutting out<br>  it could be anything,but i would check the coil packs under the<br>  plastic cover on the cylinder head.These have a hard life and are<br>  exposed to quite high temperatures and usually fail after a few yrs.

LuqZXXyBaa	The first answer is wrong.... Insurance always follows the vehicle, not the driver. If your mom gave you permission to drive the vehicle while she was away then you will be covered under permissive use. Tell your mom to check with her insurance agency about this. You don't live with her and you are not a regular driver of the vehicle. You don't have to be listed on the policy if you do not live with your mom, have your own car/insurance, and live in a different town. |`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Well, unfortunately you aren't on her policy, therefor you were driving the car illegally in the first place. There is no insurance company in the world that will pay for the damage in that situation.     A) you were lucky not to be arrested by the police for driving without insurance    and     B) You (or your mum) are liable for all the necessary repairs to your mums car!

4d1ed0b771143afc8f21cd1ebe05d5c4aa	You will have to inform the DVLA, and your insurance company.<br>  Because insurance companies dislike modified cars, your insurance will probably be more than that for a RenaultSport Clio 2.0.<br>  <br>  As others have said, you will have to upgrade the brakes and suspension to cope with the additional power and weight of the 2.0-litre engine. You'll also need to use the transmission and driveshafts from a 2.0-litre Clio.<br>  <br>  The cost will probably be far higher than selling your car and buying a RenaultSport Clio 2.0. Don't do it the hard way, when there is an easier, cheaper, and well-proven option.|`|EWIrcjBBaa	It's definitely possible.<br>  Before investing in a new engine, try seeing what aftermarket modifications you can do to your car. For example, if your engine is Electronically Fuel Injected with a motronic, jetronic or other similar computer, you could put stronger injectors in and increase the airflow of the intake.<br>  <br>  Aftermarket engine control also is possible because you can run a higher spark advance and adjust the fuel precisely.<br>  <br>  You could see if you could add a supercharger or a turbocharger as well.<br>  <br>  The downside to adding more power of course is that you get less efficiency.<br>  <br>  Somebody else said that you'd need new brakes, but this is not true.<br>  You only need new brakes if you're going to be exceeding the vehicle's previous maximum speed. Unless your new engine or modified engine is going to be reaching much higher RPMs, your maximum speed will say mostly the same because of the drive line.<br>  <br>  Also, it is not necessary to tell the insurance. The only people who need to know are those who are doing your smog certification.|`|AA11528998	Anything is possible but cost can prohibit<br>  <br>  Not only would you need to fit the engine but also the transmission, drive line and upgrade the suspension, brakes and steering.

Diesel is quite a dirty fuel & cokes up the engine a lot especially during short journeys in town. Take it for a journey that's a bit longer & rag it a bit to decoke the engine & that should help a lot.

elp9j6LWaa	Small cars are relatively safe and these days, carry many safety innovations that allow them to be much safer than small cars of years past.  However, it still pays to remember, a car that weighs half as much as an SUV, will probably take quite a beating when hit by something twice its weight.  That's just simple physics.|`|wpgRMjgraa	No...and I will get many thumbs down for saying this but I have driven them before and you have "ZERO" protection plus you are about 12 inches below everyone else.<br>  <br>  They have very poor handling as well as poor stability when you are passed on the highways and roads....<br>  <br>  Also taking a turn at normal speeds will wake you up very fast...|`|ojxfzv7Faa	It's not as simple as crashing a large car or truck into smaller vehicle. You have to think about stopping distance, the center of gravity and things like accident avoidance. Larger isn't always better, but same with smaller vehicles. I wouldn't want to be in a Chevy Aveo in collision with a Hummer H2.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Neither car is necessarily going to be safer. A large, older car will probably come off worse if it hits a new small car, even though it has the size advantage. Likewise an older small car will definitely come off worse against any newer car, whatever the size but will also come off worse against any large car. This is because manufacturers are constantly improving the safety standards of their cars.<br>  New cars are built to such a safety standard that you could probably survive a head on impact from a fully laden articulated truck! This includes smaller cars and large ones!|`|oDoCe5gYaa	They are safer in accident avoidance and can be safer than other cars, it all depends on the make/model/year of the cars you are comparing.  I would avoid a head on collision in my Mazda miata with the first guys Ford truck.|`|8P33hizLaa	i think bigger cars are safer because when you get in an accident you have smaller chance of getting crushed.|`|bW931jBaaa	No. I would trust my F 350 crew cab to come out on top in a head on collision with a Honda civic or ANY other small car.<br>  |`|pU6AwuOZaa	I live in the Uk and I was a bit intrigued when one of the answers said a Honda Civic was a small car. Unless it is a different model, because the Honda Civics would be classed as a large car.<br>  <br>  Small cars are safe. True, if you get in an impact with a large SUV they will sustain more damage, but that is only one type of accident. All car manufacturers care about safety (well it sells cars) so they make sure that every car is as robust as possible. If small cars were not safe, no one would drive them.<br>  <br>  In fact, when the Chrysler Voyager (which is a large car) was launched in Europe, NCAP (the EU's testing body for cars) awarded it no points at all for front impact protection, saying that it preformed worst in its group by some margin.<br>  <br>  I think that a small car is perfectly safe. I ride a motorbike so by comparison everything is safe, but I would have no worries about getting a small car. |`|7XgHUJTbaa	Peacefully salute<br>  No for an example:<br>  mercedes benz or volvo S80 sedan & any another car in the same category, mercedes or volvo well known by cars more stable & more safe than any another car.<br>  That cause technology is a must as now a days but not as manufacturer extend cars with steel or iron than carbon or fiber parts.<br>  But that is not a witness cause BMW make it's cars lighter weight & more safe with also carbon or fiber technology.<br>  i had seen before an experiment for the 4 & 2 wheels cars as I remember,<br>  (Opel corsa hutch back) 4 wheel versus (mercedes but i don't know the model but mercedes is stronger as we know it's  sedan) rear wheel &<br>  you can't imagine that Opel corsa demolished as I remember the front of the mercedes. <br>  That experiment from i think 10 years.<br>  you must ask a physical car specialist.<br>  but German, American & sweden cars is the best over all,<br>  mostly German cars.<br>  Thanks<br>  Mohab Mohammad|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Depends on what situation you're talking about.<br>  <br>  A driver in lighter weight car is going to "lose" (sustain more damage and more of an impact) in a head-on collision with a heavier car.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about accident avoidance (missing an accident) instead of accident survival (getting hit and then....), the smaller car is probably somewhat safer because in general lighter cars are more easily manuevered than heavier cars in an emergency situation, especially if the heavier car is an SUV or Truck with a higher center of gravity than the lighter car.  |`|3xXpAsrGaa	big cars are more safe when coming in a collision but more prone to accidents because they are bigger wider and more top heavy which means you have a more risk of rolling. small cars turn better and are less likely to flip unless you are a crazy driver.|`|AtRpdjczaa	Watch this video and see for yourself:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBDyeWofcLY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBDyeWofc...</a><br>  It all depends on how well the car is built.

Gt5JzC2Daa	Depends on your requirements/driving style<br>  <br>  If you blow a tyre (say by hitting the sharp edges/thick metal plates you sometimes get at roadworks) then you can crack an alloy wheel, which would normally require it to be replaced. If you're really unlucky the wheel might disintergrate, and dropp that corner of the car onto the ground, potentially causing some very expensive damage. Steel is ductile (rather than brittle) and so will bend rather than shatter, so it's far less catastrophic. It's true very badly rusted steel wheels can fail too (by "bending") but you're likely to spot excessive rusting before it becomes a real problem.<br>  <br>  For a given diameter of wheel, alloys are lighter. This reduces the ratio of unsprung to sprung mass (the wheel's aren't sprung, but the "body" is) This should mean that when you go over a bump/pothole, the vehicles body is more likely to continue in a straight line, where as the wheels will go up and down. Supposed to make a difference with ride comfort, but I don't know quite how much difference it makes (but it's one of the reasons why people tend to prefer heavier cars. The weight of the wheels don't increase by nearly as much as that of the body!). Alternatively you can get a larger diameter alloy wheel which weighs the same as a steel wheel that's of smaller diameter. Larger wheel diameter, means more contact area, which can have better grip in the dry (larger diameter wheels will have a greater risk of aquaplaning)<br>  <br>  Steel can rust, which looks unsightly. Alloy can still corrode (especially in acid conditions), but they are fairly easy to clean.<br>  <br>  Steel is cheaper, and so you're less likely to have someone (attempt to) "nick" them!|`|BZMPax7Naa	The aluminum alloy wheels are lighter, nicer looking, and corrosion resistant.  Steel wheels don't look near as nice. They are heavier and can rust.  The one drawback of alloy wheels is that if it gets bent.  You can't repair it.  On steel wheels you can usually bend it back.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Alloys do look nice but (depending on their size & how much rubber you actually have on the tyre) they do tend to provide a harsher ride. Alloys are also easily damaged by kerbs etc whereas all you need to do is replace the cap on a steel wheel.|`|raA86xtpaa	depends on what's important, and road conditions...<br>  <br>  alloys are good for performance applications, less weight, and more unique designs.<br>  <br>  steel are better for harsh conditions, bad roads, and high stress applications where power is more important than speed.|`|kkVRNJCFaa	if your going for looks it has to be alloy<br>  if your going for comfort it has to be steel<br>  if you want a higher resale it has to be alloy
XsZsk55Jaa	The SR-71 is the fastest air breathing operational aircraft at about Mach 3.5.   Rocket powered aircraft have gone faster, the X-15 to Mach 6 or 4500 miles per hour.

You must have noticed earlier when you used to apply hand brake it was coming on and on release it was off. Now it is ON all the time. The reason being that your handbrake is either sticking somewhere in the rear wheel which has to be adjusted or the sticking part released and lubricated or the handbrake switch inside the car under the handbrake lever is sticking. Not a big job to set the button released which you can do it yourself. It so happens with the switch sticking, a drop of oil with set it right. Of course to adjust and release the wheel mechanism is a bit time consuming. If you have a bit of tools and a little bit of mechanism, having help from some body you can surely clean the assembly and lubricate the lever moving part which sometime becomes sticky with dirt and mud, just cleaning and oiling would make it right. Sometimes the cable near the wheel Assembly is sticking and this is covered with rubber, you have to cut the rubber a bit and pour oil inside this insulation to release same. Take help from someone to press the pedal otherwise you will not notice it whether it is moving or not.

KWArXP1Laa	is it a steering or suspension problem is it pulling the car to the left or right or are u getting surges from the engine?more info|`|mKVFIklaaa	Does it roll freely if you push it on flat ground in neutral with the handbrake off? If not, the brakes may be sticking.<br>  If they're not sticking, there may be a problem with the engine: Does it stutter under acceleration or is there a definite 'flat spot'? Have you changed the plugs & leads?|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	I still have no idea from that suggestion. The only thing I can suggest is that it is either your brakes sticking on (or you have left the handbrake on!) Or there is something other than the oil & fuel filter wrong with your car, it is after all a fiat & is more likely to break down than any other car on the road...|`|2iExHm4Eaa	Add some more specific info on what exactly the car is doing because I dont understand what you mean by the car "pulling".<br>  <br>  Is the engine missing and then jolting forward?

After that your car will have to be taken off the public road as it can be towed away even if you aren't using it! Legally you cannot drive it once the road tax runs out, the week only applys to the fact that the DVLA will not fine you until after that first week (to allow for postage time!). However, if the police catch you without road tax they can still take away the car, fine you, give you points on your license, and they can charge you for all the time that they store the car while you wait for your insurance to come through! In short, don't use it after midnight & park your car on the driveway!|`|zDVPTWtUaa	Simple answer is no. You also need to inform DVLA that you are the new owner. This can be done by completing the appropriate form when taxing the vehicle.<br>  <br>  Consider that many police forces now use ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras (some of which are linked to average speed cameras and if they take a picture then you will receive an automatic fine.<br>  <br>  If your car is towed away then you will be charged a fee for towing plus storage charges. The vehicle will only be released when you tax the car and pay the fees.<br>  <br>  Cheaper just to tax it.

Which will lead to you being fined, if not worse, because without your car being taxed (and MOT'd), your insurance will be invalid anyway. Don't do it, it's not worth the risk. Go to Post Office in the morning and get it taxed. Its cheaper than a fine and points and whatever else the Police can charge you with for not having tax and insurance.

Ideally, the passenger seat should be as far back as you can get it too, especially if your car has driver & passenger airbags!<br>  <br>  Note I did say a child (as in 1 single child) not more than one child!|`|hktbfRPWaa	No. Every person in your car must have a seat and a seat belt.

What you need to do is connect the positive cable (the red one) to the positive terminal of both batteries Then you will connect the negative cable to the negative terminal of the good battery and finally connect the other end to a good ground.

Excessive revving at this stage will only compound the problem. You need to get a new clutch fitted ASAP, or if the car isn't worth the cost - you need to get another car.!<br>  <br>  Best thing is not to drive the car anymore, until you have got it fixed. Further driving will lead to damage to the flywheel, and will, if you continue to use it, need the flywheel skimmed. This is not a good idea, because it will only serve to add to the repair bill.<br>  <br>  A brand new clutch replacement kit will include, a new driven plate, a new clutch cover/pressure plate, and usually, a new clutch release bearing.<br>  <br>  If you go to a garage, it can be an expensive job - into the hundreds of pounds. If you can do it yourself, or have knowledgeable and capable friends or relatives, it need not cost more than the price of the replacement parts - typically ￡60.00 to ￡120.00 depending upon which variant you have, and where you source your parts.<br>  <br>  You may be able to pick up a good new and unused kit on eBay, fairly cheaply.<br>  <br>  Don't be tempted to use second hand parts, the amount of work involved is just too much,  to risk using used spares...|`|a7b8ce8902b61735d21f88afc5a9dd69aa	Hi<br>  <br>  It sounds very much as though your clutch is slipping.

There are hundreds of cars in the price range of under ￡2k. And don't forget the first ￡500 is already spent, either on the 25 repair or a new car so the new car, whatever the price, is already part paid by ￡500. Once you have found a prospective new car have the AA or RAC do a check, it.s worth the ￡50 or so. Hope this helps. (xxx lol)|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	As much as I like Rovers (after owning three) I would still have to say get the Hyundai. The Head gasket has gone on your Rover (a ￡400 - ￡500 fix for starters) & the coupe is a better drive anyways! Even if you do get the head gasket fixed it is highly likely to go again in the not too distant future. Personally I'd cut my losses now, it's what I'll probably do if my Rover 45 ever has the same problem!|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Just remember that the Hyundai will be noticeably more expensive to insure and run - and probably has been thrashed.

As for the Hyundai Coupe, again, its a pretty high mileage car and although they look cool, my advice would be to use the ￡2000 to get a smaller, lower millage car thats going to give you a few years of service. Huynidais are relaible in general, but the insurance costs will be MUCH more then the Rover. You may even find a dealership that will do you a minimum part exchange on the Rover, regardless of its condition, so you could add that to the ￡2000.

RQPbrYWEaa	If you want to do it at a dealer, it should be hopefully under $100 due to labor charges....  You can also try doing this repair yourself.  First is to check the horn fuse in the engine compartment to see if it failed. or you can swap with a new fuse to confirm that it is not a fuse problem.  Then you can try buying an aftermarket horn which is $15-$18 at advance autoparts or auto parts store and follow the below directions for replacing the horn. My old accent had the horn rust out AND have a fuse fail so both needed to be replaced...  I am all self taught and am good at reading directions carefully.<br>  <br>  Do it yourself  for the hyundai with pictures;:<br>  <a href="http://www.elantragtclub.com/elantra/id127.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elantragtclub.com/elantra/id1...</a><br>  <br>  another factory horn replacement:<br>  <a href="http://egt.gwebworks.com/garage.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://egt.gwebworks.com/garage.shtml</a><br>  |`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	If it's a fuse then pennies.

b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Barry B is right in a way. There is definitely something wrong with your engine, or the engine management system. The engine management system is putting your car into, i guess you could describe it as a "protection mode". It's trying to protect your engine from further damage (as Barry B says) but it's leaving you with enough power to crawl out of harms way, i.e onto the hard shoulder or a parking area. |`|lBRud4y5aa	Spanner icon means a service is due.

In many of those school shooting incidents you have heard about in the news, word got out to emergency personel via student and teacher cell phones.<br>  <br>  The other issues is that teachers should be monitoring their classes for cell phone use.

fN0x4E1naa	Because it kills the Petroleum Industry's profits and they have the money and the lobbyists to prevent that from happening. <br>  <br>  I must say my favorite post was from Ken E. Seriously? While I would completely agree that pouring water into the gas tank would most certainly not be a good idea, HHO (which incidentally consist of hydrogen) can provide extra fuel to your vehicle. <br>  The common misconception here, is that HHO breaks the first law of thermodynamics by trying to create excess energy from nowhere. This law has always been a real thorn in the side of those who have tried to create perpetual motion machines and the like. Fortunately for HHO, the first and second laws of thermodynamics work to enforce HHO, not break it apart, as the HHO is being created via electrolysis by energy that the car has wasted. The internal combustion engine is under a quarter of it's total efficiency and an Hydrogen Assist Fuel Cell acts only to improve that efficiency.<br>  Science is based on results. The core understanding of the Scientific Method is that a theory can not be proven without results and must in fact be found in probable or impossible. <br>  That being said, there are numerous example of reputable institutions and governments reliance on HHO as a means to reduce emissions and improve fuel mileage. The US government has converted many of their military vehicles to HHO. South Korea has enlisted a private company to convert 100,000 of their vehicles. Even  super cars have been built with HHO technology providing 450 HP with a stunning 40 mpg.<br>  |`|AA10826645	They do exist!  Do your home work before posting!

Don't buy into it.<br>  <br>  The stories about turning water (H2O) into a volatile gas (HHO) is based on valid science and that just adds credibility to the scam. Unfortunately, the energy required to convert the water to HHO gas equals the energy returned when it is burned as fuel, and since internal combustion engines are notoriously inefficient, the actual power to convert the water far exceeds the power that is returned.|`|k6IFEGYzaa	Another conspiracy theory I'm afraid.

The colder the air is when it gets into the engine, the more power you can get out of it (how much depends on the engine and how it has been built).  Also, the more air you can get into the engine the more power you can get out.  I am not familiar with a  "short ram" intake, but I am guessing it is similar to ram air, which is basically some sort of scoop positioned so that the car moving forwards will push air into the scoop (and through it into the engine).  I have seen these on the hood, in the grille (some race drivers like to take out one of the headlights and run the air intake through that location), and under the bumper.  If you position the scoop so that the air only has to flow a short distance to get into the engine, you have basically achieved both cold air and ram air.  The most important thing is that the engine needs to stay balanced.  By this I mean if you make a major change to one part of the engine, think about how that will effect the rest of it.  For example, if you make it easier for the engine to draw air in (low resistance intake or a scoop and a high-flow air filter), make sure the exhaust you have will be able to easily flow the extra air back out.  Don't go overboard, however, and put on an exhaust that flows too much air or you will loose too much back-pressure and the engine can run weaker as a result.  The same thing applies for fuel injector or carburetter size.  Balance is key.  Good luck.|`|AA10923152	well if you can do a short ram and have it coming in from your hood that would be the best.

b7781d9ab228b9235f38f0cae381705aaa	My girlfriend has a 02 Grand Am and this job is kinda stupid.  You have to take the headlight assembly out of the car!  <br>  <br>  First, remove the plastic trim between the front grille and the rad support.  There's about a dozen plastic push clips that have to come out.<br>  <br>  Next, pull up on the black painted sheet metal retaining clip(s), there might be two, I don't remember anymore.  It's about 1-1/4" wide and bent at 90 degrees.  If it's rusty, use a prybar against a block of wood on the rad support to lift it up.  It needs to come up a few inches, then the whole headlight will come out.<br>  <br>  I recommend replacing all of the bulbs at the same time (yellow wedge bulbs too), because you've done so much work just to get to the headlight bulb, it would suck to have to do it again in a few months because your corner marker bulb burnt out.<br>  <br>  Reverse the procedure to put it all back together.  Make sure you get the adjuster mechanism lined up before you push the clips back down to secure the headlamp assembly.|`|AA10987972	it`s a bulb and you get to it under the hood you may have to take out the battery or what ever is on the other side to do this|`|fc7bb2d9a2097a7395b9d2760b40b848aa	If memeory serves me correctly,<br>  Open the hood and you will see two black knobs about the size of a milk bottle cap. Undo these and the entire assembly will come out to access the bulb in the back . Undo the large black ring on the back of the assembly and gently pull the bulb out. Reverse the process for installation. <br>  <br>  NOTE<br>  Dont touch the new bulb with your hands......<br>  The oils on your hands will effect the life of the bulb.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

AA10987972	left front closest to the rad|`|363f92c06f1199a4592395c669517c4aaa	Wow, you've got stuff strewen out all over answers.com...<br>  <br>  #1 cylinder is first cylinder on driver's side of engine.  #2 is first cylinder on passanger's side of engine.  Odd cylinders are on driver's side, front to back its 1-3-5-7. Even cylinders are on passanger's side, front to back is 2-4-6-8.<br>  <br>  My method of finding top dead center is to pull both valvecovers.  This allows you to see both #1 and #6 cylinders.  See, #1 cyl fires every OTHER time the timing marks on balancer line up.  The next revolution, #6 cylinder lines up with timing mark.  So its easy to get confused and think you're lined up on #1, when you're actually lined up on #6.  So I watch the valves to be sure.  When #1 is ready to fire, the timing marks line up, and the #1 valves are closed.  If the #1 valves are closed, and the #6 valves are sorta open, #1 is ready to fire.  Thats when I twist distributor body so rotor is pointing to a plug socket on the cap.  Then I put a plug wire from that socket to the #1 plug wire.  Then I add the other wires around the cap, going counter clockwise for a pontiac in the correct firing order.   <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you guys are rushing or panicked.  Its a bad thing to do when firing a new motor.  Excessive cranking can ruin a new camshaft.  I hope you know how to do the 30 minute cam break-in once she fires off.  Bring RPMs to 2000 as soon as it starts, and vary 2000-2500 RPM for 30 minutes.  This provides enough splash lube as camshaft breaks in.  I always have a helper looking for leaks or fire when I break-in a new engine.  Fire extinquisher is a must.  A lot of excessive cranking or idling during the first 30 minutes will ruin the engine.  Take a deep breath and double check the basics, besides the firing order.

The best way to have it done is with a machine that draws it out and replaces it with new fluid.Don't bother with draining it from the bottom as that only changes 6 or 7 quarts. The preferred method will remove all the old fluid(12 to 15 qts.)It cost me 60.00 at a Jiffy lube last time I had it done.

You can replace the belt driven fan with an electric one, which will come on with a relay only when the car actually gets hot.<br>  <br>  If you already have an electric fan - and it comes on immediately even when the car is cold, you might have a stuck relay.<br>  <br>  I forgot about the thermostat--most people went with that, but if that doesn't fix it, then go down my list.|`|AA10987972	replace the thermostat|`|AA12065549	most likely, your thermostat is stuck in the open position<br>  replace thermostat, usually less than 5 dollars, and should be fine|`|G9QHxZZIaa	probably a stuck thermostat...does your car overheat when it is hot out?|`|c634e13f1d954986b3b16f4985dc9d84aa	assuming that there are no driveability concerns, it sounds as though your heater core is plugged up. as far as the temp guage, that is probably the sending unit. both of these problems are easily (and cheaply) fixed

The clutch usually takes a while to wear out.|`|oice6iXAaa	Sounds like a bad synchro mesh. The clutch and the transmission share certain parts, and when they are out of allignment you will get the grinding sound.<br>  <br>  If its grinding real bad and you have to force it in gear, and the engine dies, thats a tell tale sign that the clutch is not disengaged from the flywheel.<br>  <br>  Your car is acctually trying to go, but stalls out because once its in gear it wants to go right then.<br>  <br>  DO NOT try to move it anymore. Take it to a clutch shop and get it repaired before you damage the transmission gears anymore.<br>  <br>  Im sorry to say it but its going to cost you between 200-400 dollars to get it fixed.<br>  <br>  Those prices are from my history of getting clutches replaced and other neccesary parts.

555743f6036a03a182f81c8392f9189baa	If its the 100 octane at the pump, you shouldnt notice a difference.  There is no real issue with running the 100, unless your car requires it.  Besides, most modern cars will adjust timing to compensate for the fuel you're using.  Either way, using a higher octane will not damage your car.|`|1nPvXaOOaa	it will be fine it will probably run really good. its just really really expensive|`|ITrdiH73aa	it will not hurt at all|`|gvbjSdy3aa	It will not harm his car.|`|VUdVuwEpaa	no it will not ... i run 102 octane in my 87 shelby dodge charger|`|EKbsCexbaa	Well if it is true racing fuel and not just the 100 Octane available at the pump then yes you could have a problem.  That fuel is designed to burn hotter than normal and could potentially burn up his pistons/valves/and melt spark plugs.  But if it is just 100 octane pump fuel more than likely it will just run like a "bat out of hell" for a while!

ls7B0hrqaa	the amps specs say it will put out 2400 at 1 ohm...1300 at 4 ohm and that sub will only hold about about 500 rms sounds like the amp might be too much for that sub|`|78fe6dc35e11bf043461d2380c58c2a1aa	Your subs are good quality but this amp is too powerful for them. Even at 4 Ohms this amp will produce 1200x1 or 600x2 RMS. Your subs are only rated at 200-500 RMS each according to crutchfield.com. The PMA800DA is closer to the power you need at 800x1 or 400x2 RMS and this is at 4 Ohms. With the PMA1200DA you would need subs rated at 1000-1200watts RMS each for 1 Ohms. I install car stereos and accessories on the weekends and if you need any advise please let me know. The Alphasonik brand is awesome quality but there are some good quality Class D amps out there much much cheaper. And for power, unless your a raphead in need of god aweful bass, 1ohm is not neccessary.|`|b0cab2db611ffa5885013d5da69d9979aa	<a href="http://www.ikesound.com/product-product_id/6022" rel="nofollow">http://www.ikesound.com/product-product_...</a><br>  solid amps, believe me, and the price is damn worth it , i would definetly take this in a heart beat, enough watts , and this amp dont kill the electrical system in your car! good luck buddy!

b0cab2db611ffa5885013d5da69d9979aa	the 12in type r's are 750 rms.  that amp you have is the only 1000 rms, it will work, but no head room, as in your situation you will need it. only thing to do is to port the box, and the amp will be fine. sealed box is kinda pushing it , but will work , not to the fullest though.|`|efbb49a16047f43f1a1f84d247740993aa	It depends on how your car is. If it you dont place sounds dampening like Dynomat your car will most likely rattle and make your system sound like crap. Also if you are using an enclosure you need to make sure it is secure in your trunk otherwise it can bounce where it is causing excess vibrations. I looked up your amp and it only contains one output so if you are running you speakers in series this will be the only way they will run effectively dropping the 1000 watt down to 500. Also remember to watch the power drop in your car. You may need a 1 farad capacitor to help.

As in, for a supercharged engine? Or a high hp normally aspirated engine?<br>  The crank, rods, pistons, cam, etc all need to be matched specifically to your goals, or it wont be worth doing.

I don't recommend this for a beginner as it requires some very good experience to do.

I would expect it to have problems more due to age than miles.  I have a 2000 4runner with 165,000 miles and no major problems.  <br>  After 10-12 years seals start to wear out and you get more leaks.  If the AC works, keep in mind that it could leak and stop working at any time.  My biggest driveability concerns would be that it couldn't pass the smog test without repairs and that the transmission is in good shape.  You will need to check the fluids every 1000miles to make sure you don't have any new problems.  You won't be buying peace of mind with that car, but you will be saving a lot of money and in certain phases in life it is wiser to save money.  And its always better to stay out of debt.  To me, popping the hood once or twice a month is a lot easier work than putting in 60 hours in a cubicle in order to buy a new BMW.|`|5c2491bd314b906969d7d9b49e9694aeaa	Toyota's are good cars.
