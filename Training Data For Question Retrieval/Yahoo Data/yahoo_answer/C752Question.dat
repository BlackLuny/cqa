I remember on the whole first date/getting to know each other phase he referred to him as a meat and potatoes type of guy. I like to cook and will probably make him dinner sometime. I could ask him what kinds of food he specifically likes, but that wouldn't be a surprise!      He's not a farmer, but he's kind of a country guy. This is the Midwest of the U.S. so the food's pretty traditional. He's also in his mid-twenties so I would doubt he's referring to anything like fillet mignon. I'm guessing he'd like something like pot roast and mashed potatoes.       Any suggestions of what to cook for him? Thanks!

It tastes apricot/peach and a lil bitter. Any suggestions for a mix/cocktail to make it taste decent so i can have it like an actual drink not just chug-and-chase. (even alcohol i don't have a problem with that).   I was thinking maybe something with strong flavor or idk.   I also have pills here which sound like a better option but whenever i even think about the pills it gets me nausea.   Oh and the syrup is called Rofedex if that matters in any way.   Thanks in advance.       And for the people that always say : "drugs r bad" or "don't do that sht" well..SCREW YOU!

20090219201448AAKJkSp	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Is animal lard used in cooking vegetable chow mein?	I've been craving chow mein lately, so I've been getting in from this Chinese restaurant (I'm guessing it's more authentic, too, since it's in SF and most of the patrons are Asian) but I know the Chinese are notorious for finding a way to put meat into everything.      Well, I've been a vegetarian for over a year now and I'm not so sure how my body would handle meat at this point. Anyways, I'm just wondering what the likelihood is of chow mein being fried in lard, or somehow having lard in the noodle itself. The first time I ate it was a couple days ago and my stomach felt a tiny bit upset afterward, which is why I suspected there may have been some sort of animal products used.      I'm eating it right now and so far I feel okay, but I'd prefer not to break my habit of vegetarianism, either.
