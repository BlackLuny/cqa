Qmef98Kaaa	You don't say whether it's going to be commercial or residential cleaning, not that it makes too much difference, except it marketing mostly.    The one thing you left out in 'things to do', is get liability insurance. A must not only to protect your self from claims (usually false) but also gives your prospect and customer peace of mind.  Call around to lots of insurance agents to get quotes-it varies alot.  And, if you're thinking about going into office cleaning, ask them about who cleans their office!    You usually provide supplies, but that can vary too.  A nice little hint is to transfer your supplies into nondiscript bottles so your customer is in the dark as to what you are using.    I have alot more information, resources and tips below...

DorePwVOaa	You'll want to study film production - a program that offers a BFA (Bachelors of Fine Arts). My original major was Film and Animation at Rochester Institute of Technology, but it sounds like you want to stay in southern California, which I think is smart, since you're already in that location. Here's the thing: something like what I took is very hands on - it will give you the actual experience that film companies are looking for. "Film studies" or "Cinema studies" will involve watching and critiquing a lot of films - setting you up to be a film critic, not a film maker. Go for a school that lets you actually hold a camera!

But I am going to give you some honest advice when looking for services.    Whether your going to hire a firm or a consultant I would make sure the following aspects are in any contract:-    - Make sure you have the option to cancel the contract on a monthly basis, don't get stuck in a contract for more than a month.    - Make sure you know exactly what your getting ie. keyword analysis, content optimisation, content creation, site structuring, link building, press releasing, etc....    - Ensure you are going to get a monthly progress report of how your campaign is shaping up.    - Make sure any techniques used are white hat and make sure this is in the contract.    - No one can guarantee a high Google rank no matter how good they think they are, I would simply ignore anyone making this claim. They are simply trying to win business.    - SEO services are not cheap! Any consultant or company charging you under $20 an hour are probably giving you half a service, on the other hand over $75 dollars and your being ripped off.    - Make sure you have a company address and full contact details    - Make sure the firm states if adwords or search marketing techniques are to be used. Some companies guarantee the top position but simply pay for it through adwords without telling you.     - Remember testimonials can be fraud, so look for some sort of certification as to internet marketing. Web Design is not SEO, I know a lot  of web designers that pass their seo work to an expert.    I hope this helps you decide on a company or consultant.

EsYfnOrkaa	Mortgage rates vary, by the hour or even minute anywhere in the World. Rates are determined by the property, the buyers credit worthiness, and the laws of the land. To find out what a mortgage will cost you, go on the internet and find a lender in the Country in which you want to borrow money, Each country has it's own laws as to who is allowed to lend in that country, many American companies, have branches in the UK, and can lend to any qualified person on property in that country.  The current rates here in Augusta Ga are different from the current rates in Atlanta Ga and the Uk will have different rates for different parts of the Uk still depending on your credit rating and the location of the property.
iu7L8jepaa	You really should talk with them. They'll be impressed that you're interested- every non-profit wants staff members who are passionate about their work, and it definitely sounds like you are- and will be able to give you more specific advice than anyone on here (unless someone here just happens to work for them.)    Just email staff members listed on their website, or send a letter to the Human Resources department of their organization.  You could call, too, but emails and letters would probably be better.    Sounds like a neat organization!  Good luck!
EsYfnOrkaa	There is nothing unprofessional about asking if a place is haunted. But the owner probably does not owe you a truthful answer, since it is so subjective! I don't believe in Ghost, so if someone asked me that question, I could so NO, even if the last tenant told me objects were floating around, i don't have to believe what they said or pass it on to the next tenant.    Different states have different laws, Georgia even says a landlord does not have to tell you about a sexual predator living next door, because they publish a public list of the location af all sexual predators on the internet. You also don't have to disclose a murder in the property, since they are a matter of public record, that the renter or buyer can determine on their own, and Realtors cannot say anything negative about a property, except to tell buyers and tenants to check the state websites.  Your state laws can be very different, so check with your agent, and or a lawyer if you need more direct advice.|`|fvN18yvGaa	You cant be serious...if u weren't joking id think ud have the brains of a dog bowl...Unless u heard of something happening there what landlord do u think is going 2 tell you that..hes looking for a qualified renter..he doesn't care about ur phobias or personal issues..|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	You could say something like, "Is there any other information about this apartment that would be useful to know?

5ocZVuaCaa	First things first.. call the IRS, request an installment agreement.  Divide the amount you owe by 60 and this will give you a rough estimate of a monthly payment.  They will ask you to provide them with your expenses and income, and if you truly do not make enough money to pay at this time, you could be considered for a temporary non collectible status. This does not stop penalties and interest though, so your balance will continue to increase.  Also any refunds you may be expecting will be applied to the balance due.    Secondly, take all of your return information for the year you included the pension income you received to a tax professional. You may have overlooked some deductions and may be able to lower your tax bill by filing an amended tax return.     Good luck, and remember, IRS employees are people too, they just have difficult jobs.
K7x1RHVFaa	Okay.     I like this one as you have to pay attention to your explanation to catch the twist.    For those who missed it, you mother filled out the hospital forms and thus the deduction if there were one would go to your mother.    Having been through many hospital experiences she was the one who accepted liability ofr the debt and not you.    Had you filled out the paperwork we might be talking about itemizing your medical expenses to capture this expense. You only asked if it could be done and not how to do it.  It can not be done until you pay for it but once you pay for it, it can be deducted, but once again, only your mother can deduct it. The debt is not yours.    I know you are missing this fact but the hospital is seking money from the wrong person and they know that. they should be after your mother.    I hope this made sense.     Good Luck.|`|Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    You can only claim on your taxes things that have already been paid.  So, no, you cannot put that on your taxes.    Also, to claim your medical expenses, you have to be able to itemize your deductions.  This means that if you have enough deductions you can take more than the standard deduction.  Usually you can only itemize if you have a mortgage because the mortgage interest is usually very large and enables you to itemize.  So even if it was a paid bill you probably would be better using the standard deduction and not listing the medical separately.    Hope this helps.

This deduction is itemized deduction. You will take deduction only if your itemized deductions are more than your standard deduction..You can deduct the expenses that are more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (Form 1040, line 38).

ZeDjn4cVaa	Until the property is completed, advertised and available for rent, it is not reported on schedule E.     Until that time you can only deduct property taxes related to the building.  You cannot deduct mortgage interest, travel, etc. All of the mortgage interest, travel, and other costs you incur are "capitalized" and added to your cost basis of the property. You care then allowed to depreciate this cost basis over 27.5 years beginning in the year you start to rent the apartment.  Your travel costs using a mileage log and the standard mileage allowance can be added to the cost basis of the apartment.    So you do get a deduction, but it is spread out over many years after the apartment is being rented.    Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  Enrolled Agent    This advice is based upon my understanding of the tax law at the time it was written as it applies to the facts provided by you.  See my profile for more information.|`|AA11284831	I would strongly suggest that you consult with a local tax pro.  I see several issues at work here that need professional intervention.    Since this is an investment, your interest deduction is limited to your income and you have no income from it yet.  The interest, as well as the travel costs, would be added to your basis, not deducted as itemized deductions or business expenses.  Alternatively they could be treated as start-up costs and amortized over time once it starts generating income.    Locate a CPA or EA who specializes in this type of investment.
AA10305589	Sorry but I haven't read that she is on public assistance?  I believe she was working for the fertility clinic where she got the implantation.  As she was working, she likely had insurance to cover the hospital costs.

AA10283296	If they file at about the same time, both returns will be halted until the IRS conducts a review and your parents will have to "prove" they have the right to claim you.    Sorry you are in the middle of their problems, it stinks.|`|Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    The IRS will only allow one person to claim the children.  There are tiebreaker rules for when two people claim the same dependents.     First, parent always wins.  Second, if both are parents, who the dependent lived with the longest wins.  Third, if time for each is the same, the one with the highest Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) wins.  Fourth, if neither are parents, the one with the highest AGI wins.    It will take awhile for the process to take place so you will need some patience.    Also, the one that files electronically first will go through and the second one will be rejected from electronic filing and will have to mail the return in.  It will take time.

AA11697663	2 things, first while you probably wont pay fee's on the card. you will take a hit to your credit score for opening a new line of credit. Also if you really don't use the card at all for a long period of time you risk the bank closing the card, which might also take a chunk out of your credit score in the future. a better option might be, (if you already have a credit card with bank of america) call them and ask them if you can change your old card to the hello kitty card. (just watch the rate and rewards change). If all go's well you might get the new look for an old card plus all the history of the old card and wont take a credit hit and will now get to flash your new looking card around like you did with the old.|`|GqTSa85daa	Should be no fee when no balance.|`|AA10274297	Sign up for the card, enjoy it, and the person who designed the card will probably get a promotion if they get a lot of people like you to get the card!

ssQb7bB3aa	Not all doctors deal in blood, organs or tissues. However, everyone who chooses to do medicine has to  1. do and be good at anatomy in medical school - human/cadaveric dissection is a main feature of anatomy  2. be an intern/resident after graduation. During your last years in medical school, internship and residency, you have to be able to draw blood, give injections. You probably will also rotate through ER (Emergency department) where trauma patients will be seen. Some things seen there cannot be predicted beforehand and cannot be forgotten easily.    It's good to have a bright daughter. If one is bright, it doesn't necessarily mean medical school or being a doctor. There are many careers out there which need intelligent people. The ultimate question is what does *she* want to do? Perhaps, it will be a good idea to let her shadow different people in different careers - that's one way of finding out what different people do in different careers.|`|fAcVndo7aa	I would definitely advise her to think about choosing another path.  Pharmacy, mental health, and research all utilize the same skill set without the blood-and-guts factor.    I have known a couple people who were able to overcome their squeamishness, but it's pretty rare.  If she really thinks she might want to get into medicine, maybe she could consider either joining or doing ride-alongs with your local EMS (Emergency Medical Services) organization, or volunteering in a local hospital.  Either one could give her some exposure to the field while still leaving her the option to get away quickly if something is too much.|`|VR0h4L32aa	what grade is she in.............|`|LcnSBvqWaa	medical school is not for the squeamish, there are a lot of other professions where you don't need to deal with those things..|`|rw5N5rcKaa	I am not a doctor even though my name might imply that I am.    There are MANY areas in medical fields which do not involve having to deal with blood, organs, or tissue.  For example, Psychiatry, Nutritionist, Epidemiologist, or Chiropractor  (no need to debate the value or legitimacy of any practice here).   The point is, do some research on everything available in that field, and then determine whether or not the exposure to unpleasantness in Medical School would be a tolerable investment to reach that goal.  Could some anxiety therapy help her get through it?   (but I don't advise winding up on prescription drugs if this is not the right choice for her.)  Perhaps the course selection for a specific career path can avoid some of the particularly grueling dissections and pathology material.|`|tvDbQTJiaa	It is mental affiliation/inclination of the student that helps in the profession, he/she should take up for studies.

EsYfnOrkaa	Mortgage rates vary as to location, borrower(credit rating), and property. Yes, today's rates are as good as it gets, unless of course something changes to make them better or worse.    I suggest that today's rates near 5%, as low as 4.5% in Augusta Ga. where values have increase 5.8% in the last year, are pretty darn good. So go ahead, and refinance knowing that you probably won't miss anything much lower in 6 months unless we have a much worse slide in the overall world or national economic market.|`|fvN18yvGaa	The lowest interest rate applies to those with the best credit which is around 5% give or take some 10ths...why wait its not going 2 get much lower and soon as the economy shows some growth the fed is going to raise the rate again cause basically that's the only card they hold as far has a financial entity...their not a government agency but they control the monetary rates in America.

If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stocks, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds.  However, some young people will go all stocks, and some very conservative people will go all money markets.  The links below have on-line questionnaires which will give you an idea of how to do "Asset Allocation," determining how much to put in each type of investment.     You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Highly knowledgeable people can buy a properly balanced portfolio, but most folks have a difficult time balancing things on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks.  Back in 2000, Some people bought all Internet stocks; they got burnt when they all crashed together.   You have to diversify across industries.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds that will diversify for you.  Buy no-load, low cost funds.  Mutual funds should have expense ratios of less than 0.5%.    If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can. The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free.    I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest expenses. For stock funds, I would suggest putting ~70-80% of your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~20-30% in a foreign stock index fund. However, there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion.    If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.     I will warn you that there is a tremendous amount of stock investing books and websites that teach stock investing strategies that don't work.  Particularly bad are people that teach "technical analysis" systems that sound impressive, but don't work.    Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.
K7x1RHVFaa	It may not be anything you did but something your husband did not do.    He probably took too many exemptions on his w9 so that he received more money during the year and less money on his rebate. Ask him if he chose 0,1,or 2 on exemptions and if he listed himself as married or single.     You are probably listed as Single and 0. He may be Married and 2.     It is all in the exemptions.    edit     using your numbers:    You owe 6 in taxes and supposedly paid 706 dollars in federal withholding.    He owes 603 dollars and supposedly only paid 660 dollars in federal withholding.    Either you are paing way too much or I am missing something here.

It doesn't matter what it "should" be only what it is. Taxes are like a bell curve. At a low income they take out very few taxes, but you get a lot back because you have less taxable income and you are in a low tax bracket. As your taxable income increases, it does so slightly faster than your deductions. So if you make $20,000 you have about $13000 taxable income. If he makes double at $40000 he has $33000 taxable income so a portion of his income is in a higher tax bracket.

An alternative, less accepted definition of recession is a downward trend in the rate of actual GDP growth as promoted by the business-cycle dating committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research.[1] That private organization defines a recession more ambiguously as "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months." A recession has many attributes that can occur simultaneously and can include declines in coincident measures of activity such as employment, investment, and corporate profits.

OxM9UgEwaa	http://qbangg.blogspot.com/|`|ffxB7EdZaa	Keep it clean and simple. Don't write a book about the product, instead offer a clear, short and concise description, the price and things like dimension, shipping cost, etc. If a customer has more questions see if you can't offer a live chat. No one likes having to spend a lot of time finding what they're looking for, which makes a search bar very helpful. Customer reviews are a wonderful way to gain and lose sales (only use CRs if you know you are selling excellent products.)   Let the customer know a little about your company (or you) and make sure your prices are competitive. Having comparison shopping directly on the page of the product makes an awesome addition (preventing your customers from venturing away from your page and possibly never coming back.)    Try to keep the heavy advertisement to a minimum. No one likes the ads to run across their screen or make it difficult to click on something without opening a pop-up window screaming that them to rent DVDs or let them know they've just won a fake lottery.    Another great thing to offer would be monthly specials. (Free shipping on orders over $___, etc.)    It would be helpful if we knew what you were selling.

eqSKmV7taa	PAY OFF THE CARDS!!     While your credit score is important, paying off your debt is way more important!! Not only will you be saving major cash by not paying all of that interest - but you won't have that payment hanging over your head every month!  And in this economy, paying them off, cutting them up and only using cash is the smartest thing you can do!!      As far as how it will affect your credit score...it depends on why your credit score is low in the first place.  But honestly, trying to improve your credit score isn't the way to make sure you can buy that furniture.  Making sure you can truly afford it is what really matters.  Save up and only buy it when you have the cash.     This is a link to an article that cover the info on credit scores and the factors that go into them...    http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/2...    This is a link to a CC payoff calculator.  Enter your info. and look at the amount of money would cost to pay it off over a year vs. just paying the entire balance off with your tax refund.      http://www.bankrate.com/brm/calc/creditc...|`|AA10283296	1.  It took 9 months for my credit score to go up after I paid off $22,000 in credit cards.  The reporting agencies do what they want.    2.  Paying them off will be good for your credit until they cancel the cards for non-use (I've had 3 cards with zero balance cancel) that way they keep your score low and the interest HIGH!    So, pay them off, then use them every couple months paying them off in full.  Once a year let them make a couple bucks in interest and you should be ok.    However, unless you have cash stashed, you may want to keep part of the money in cash.  Things are going to get really, really bad before much longer.    As to the "FDIC insured account", the FDIC will NOT be able to withstand 2 or 3 large bank failures and no matter how much money the feds throw at the problem it isn't going to fix it.  I wouldn't trust any bank with my money right now.|`|9ZDCN4pAaa	You need to consider your credit to debt ratio. It is helpful to use a credit card occasionally to show that you can take credit and pay it back. But ideally, you should have a high credit limit and owe so little that you can pay it off in full at the end of the month.    In this horrible credit crunch that the country is in, it will be harder for everyone to get approved for credit. This is really a good time to pay off all credit card debt and put your money in an FDIC insured, interest-bearing account.

qJ6Qqstvaa	First thing is to check if either of the loans have prepayment penalties. See how much the penalty is.     Second you have to see how much interest is left on each loan. ALL LOANS YOU PAY ALMOST ALL INTEREST ON YOUR FIRST PAYMENT AND ALMOST NO INTEREST ON YOUR LAST PAYMENT. Banks, insurance, and loan places are smart about this if you take out $20000 dollar loan for 10% a year. First year you pay 90% towards interest and 10% towards car. Last year you pay 90% towards car and 10% towards interest. Banks are not stupid about this  they get their loan interest in your first years of payments so if you do pay it off lets say the last year they basically collected all their interest.     Check with who you got the auto loan with to see how much interest you have to still pay on the car. If your only paying 1% to 4% a year in interest it is wiser to use the money for something else.|`|AA10274297	Congratulations if you are in a position to pay off one of the loans in this economy!    First thing is to check if either of the loans have prepayment penalties.  If only one does, then pay off the loan without the prepayment penalty first.  Otherwise, pay off the $18 K loan like you said.    If you have good credit, the best way to improve it is to pay off debt.  There is no advantage to staying in debt and parceling out your payments just to show you can handle debt.    The idea of having a debt and paying it off regularly and systematically is a tactic designed to rehabilitate a credit record that has had problems in the past, to show that the person has improved their ability to handle debt.  But if you don't have any past credit problems, there is no reason to do this, and you would be much better off to pay off the loan and save the interest costs.    Hope this helps!|`|JI1oShZVaa	It definately wouldn't hurt your credit to pay it off!!    I've found some good sources here...    http://auto.deal4-you.com/    Good Luck.

(Usually around $20-$25)  Why pay more than you need to pay?|`|WKUGB4Hoaa	Howdy, what are the advantages of having a company do your taxes vs you doing them?  There was an article on AOL a few days ago that didn't paint a very positive picture about many of these places.  Hiring a CPA cost way to much and I doubt if any are available right now.  I used to used Turbo Tax until the year you had to go online to get a code to unlock their program.  My computer crashed and I went through hell trying to get another code.  Since then...no Turbo Tax for me!  This doesn't imply that they don't have good software...just a bad taste in my mouth.  Turbo Tax, H&R Block(Tax Cut) and TaxAct all have good online software.  I've been using TaxAct for 4 years and enjoy their software!  You can download it if you desire but I always use the online program.  You pay to efile with them so I think it's better to purchase the deluxe program and get the free efile...the cost is the same.  Much depends upon if you're going short or long form and you need to decide that.  Most programs will guide you step by step through the entire process but if you're unsure then go to a firm.  One thing I like about TaxAct is for a small fee they will keep your records so filling out forms the following year is much easier.  If you go that way be sure to copy and save all info they give you and you give them (user name etc).  Check out their sites and see what each offers then go with the one you feel comfortable with.  TaxAct allows you to download the free program so you might do that and try it out.  I don't know what the other sites are like so it comes down to your personal preference.  Good luck!
Ns6I7MmBaa	Are you sure you went through the entire e-file process to submit both?  If you did, the one you did 2nd will be rejected.  If the first one is accepted and is wrong, you will need to file 1040X amended return (make sure you do that before April 15th if you owe and/or got too much refund).
AA10283296	Pay off the highest interest card first.  Roll that payment (which should be minimum plus) into the next highest, then when that is paid off, roll the entire payment into the next one until you are done.    The longest pay down will be your first one, then if you are combining the payments, the next cards will get to zero much faster.  Just make sure you miss no minimums or due dates on any of them.    Good luck|`|AA10274297	If you have good credit, I would suggest calling the credit card company that you have the longest history with, and telling them that you are thinking about consolidating all your debt on one card, if they will give you a good interest rate and waive the transfer fees from the other cards.  Have all your other account numbers ready, and they may be able to do the transfer right then over the phone.  If they don't give you a deal, go to your next oldest card and try the same thing with them.  This will only work if you have always been current with your card payments.    If your credit is less than perfect, then you should pay as much as you can each month to the card with the highest interest rate, and pay the minimum on the other cards.|`|637333c441e6b619e7c53007af176cd5aa	Take the card you owe the least on and make large payments on it.

Thinking back on it that probably was a large contributor to the collapse of the economy but it's always the fastest way to pay the cards off even if not to get out of debt.    I was reading a somewhat unconventional article the other day which pointed out that most people average 10% interest on credit cards (though of course it can be more than 20$) and at best 7% on their retirement funds/investments, savings accounts are usually only 4% at the most too. So in the long run you might be better off eliminating your debt than saving money. If you have no savings or anything that perspective means nothing, but if you do then that's your most likely way to get a handle on your debt.

Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    First, you can't just go in and change the numbers on your return to add another W-2.  You have to do an amendment on Form 1040X.    Second, when you add more income you change the entire tax picture.  The added income could cause you to go into the next tax bracket or maybe the withholdings on the $8,000 was not enough, for example.    You need to wait for your refund to arrive and then complete the 1040X.  You may need to return some of that refund check so you probably shouldn't cash it until you know how much you will need.  You might want to seek the help of a tax professional for the 1040X.    Hope this helps.

Can't be efiled.      If you reported tuition reimbursement make sure you also reported tuition paid so it doesn't result in additional taxable income.    Not sure how you calculate that your return should be way more than 1000 but if you made a total of 32k your tax liability before education credits would be approx. 4400.  Compare that to what was withheld.

onkUcy19aa	Investing in the right artist or artwork at the right time offers a potentially nice return. Don't forget the added ownership and enjoyment while waiting for price appreciation. Like any business, supply and demand directly affects pricing. Other factors include authenticity, condition of the art, aesthetics and rarity. Art education remains foundational in making wise choices for art investments.    Step1Visit places that sell original art. Go to an art gallery, museum and auction house to develop a sense of both great art and art that sells.   Step2Read books and magazines on the art world. These offer background information and newsworthy items to enable you to spot trends, find new artists and understand how the art business works.   Step3Buy art after you research the type, painter, average prices and authenticity.   Step4Allocate a budget to invest in art over the long term. Artworks go up and down in price. Buying at the peak or before changing trends often means a poor investment.   Step5Invest in art that you enjoy. Know why the art appeals to you to determine if it might appeal to someone else.   Step6Keep original frames and documents of any artwork. Replace a missing frame according to its period.   Step7Insure art investments that already have value with your insurance agent.     And finally, support your local artists by buying their products.|`|IqeyFh4Qaa	If you want to support local artists donate or buy their art.

I want to open my own restaurant which can get me more money than if I was work in a restaurant owned by someone else or was to even become a manager the owner will still make more money. Choose whatever field you desire but try opening up your own business. My great uncle opened a nursing home and was RICH!!! I mean it. Although he lost it all when someone died there and they sued him. (This all happened in 2000) My dad had his own business for computer programming and made 125,000 dollars a year.

Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    It is 8 - 15 days after IRS acceptance.  The IRS will either accept or reject the return when it is filed.  If your return was not rejected then it was accepted shortly after filing it.    The delay this year from the IRS is because of the stimulus recovery rebate that was received last year.  Those that did not get all they were entitled to will get the rest of it this year.  Because of this, the IRS had pulled all tax returns with additional stimulus money for further processing.  They have since changed the process, but, unfortunately, those returns that were already pulled will still be delayed.  It should maybe take the 8 - 15 days plus a week or so.    Hope this helps.

They may reduce your payments or even forgive some of the interest but don't expect a free ride.  They won't remove your info for bad debt so you're stuck with that for 7 years.  Any loans you try to get from now on will come at higher interest rates.  For the other cards you owe.  Depends upon the issuing parent company.  If your bad debt came from a branch of the parent company then start checking your monthly statements.  If paid on time you shouldn't see any increase in payments but woe to you if you ever pay late.  Interest will rapidly rise to 25-30%.      Try to live a hermits life until you get the cards paid off.  Take them in descending order, highest rate or amount first on down the line.  Next time choose your card (just one!) carefully.

There are a few legitimate data entry companies but are not hiring and have large waiting lists (1-2yrs). The majority of data entry jobs you seen online are scams. A real company will want you to have skills inc fast typing, may want you to know MS Excel, and will usually ask that you have high speed internet. Once in a long while you may found one online on a job website but thats rare.

Cute shades on :-) Ok now on to your question.    If you are looking for a way to make money on the Internet and work from home you have found the perfect website to help guide you in the right direction. I have been working at home successfully for the past 2 years so I know what works.    There are many work-from-home programs on the Internet today that will promise you the world, however most of these programs don't deliver on their promises. If you aren't careful you will end up joining a work-from-home program that just takes your money and leaves you with an empty pocket.    I know from firsthand experience which programs actually work and which ones will just steal your money. See, two years ago when my company was having layoffs I was worried about losing my job, so I started searching the Internet for ways to create a part-time second income.    After investing 8 months of my time and over $5700 in bogus money making programs I finally found a few work from home programs that actually work. Of the 28 programs I signed up for only one of them made me money. I have provided a review of this powerful system which you can check out.    I am now happy to say I no longer have a job with my previous company. No, I wasn't laid off, I retired just 6 months after I started using this system. I have been consistently earning between $15,000 and $22,000 per month using this work from home system.    Check it out and I hope this is the answer you've been looking for.|`|KaOIK0AXaa	doubt you will find this very legitimate. if your a college student its convienient to get a night job bartending or cocktail waitress. you can make up to 300 a night!

I was a medical transcriptionist working from home for 13 years.     Many transcriptionists get their training through a course of study while others carry their medical terminology knowledge with them from other health related fields. You would need to get the terminology down, and then get started. Many companies want experience so there's a catch-22. However, doctors and hospitals may be hiring, and after a time you can work from home as many transcriptionists do.          http://www.MedicalTranscription.com|`|gynyVFLbaa	Im a stay at home mom who works from home.

WKUGB4Hoaa	This depends upon how much you have to invest.  Check with your local bank or Credit Union on Certificates of Deposit (CD's).  While the rates might not be the best they are certainly better than most returns in munies and stocks.  You might consider setting up CD's on varying terms like 6 months and 1 year...see what your institution offers.  Spread your CD's out so you're not locked in to just one date for the CD to mature.  You might want to talk to an advisor about penny stocks or buying into community planning funds.  Community funds aren't taxed (yet) and may be worth the time and trouble to find a few good ones.  Also, keep some of your money handy using a low interest savings account.  Not much for returns but the cash is available without charges if you should need it.

Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    An independent contractor is someone that works for someone else but doesn't have taxes withheld from the pay.  They usually get a 1099-MISC reporting the income to them, if it is $600 or more from one person.    Also, being an independent contractor doesn't have anything to do with being a minor and a dependent.    So, as an independent contractor, you will complete a Schedule C as part of your Form 1040 personal income tax return.  This form lists your income and expenses to come up with your net income or loss.  This gets added to or subtracted from your other income.    And, if this figure is over $400 you will need to complete Schedule SE to see if you owe social security taxes.    Hope this helps.

Did they give you a w2 or a 1099 Misc?     Either way, yes you need to file a return.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	You can be both.    Report the income on schedule C and schedule SE.  If you made more than $400, you owe self-employment tax.  If you made more than $5450, you also owe income tax.
Uqkqcnivaa	Hi!    No, you cannot both claim the same dependent.      You would have to try both tax returns a number of different ways to know which way would be best.    The one with the highest AGI (adjusted gross income) should claim HOH if they claim the child.  If the other claims the child then both should file as single.  This is because HOH has to supply over 50% of the support and it is very hard to prove that when making the lesser amount.    Be sure you include the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit when doing the calculations for the best outcome.  Also, Child Care Credit if you are claiming daycare expenses.    Hope this helps.

Nursing is hard work but has more opportunity to advance to a teaching or desk job.  Cooking is hard work and remains so.  The cooks I know who work in a Metropolitan city make around $14/hr in a retirement home.  It is hard, hard work. In the United States, you can't live on that salary.   If you don't succeed as a cook in an upscale restaurant, you will have to take whatever job you can find.  Do you plan to have a family?  If so, you will need to support them.

Ua5atQC7aa	It depends on your governing documents exactly how it's set up, but in the United States, all the owners together own the land (it is different in other countries).    Although, like the answerer above, the owners put away money each year for repairs and renovations, in a couple hundred years, the buildings just might need to be torn down - or maybe there would be a catastrophic event that would require the same.  In that case, there is specific language in your governing documents to tell you how that would work.|`|b5ac10770b1fd5e9934abfc88ae662b0aa	It depends on what state you are in.|`|h1m17rStaa	The land is a common element that is owned jointly by all unit owners.  The assocation manages it.    Most condo buildings should last 50-100 years or more.  I don't see too many people worrying about when it's going to fall down, or what happens to your land afterwards.    Ultimately, the association should be collecting enough dues to adequately maintain the units indefinitely.  Like decades forward.
f0518a87a415f5c8d89dad567e658c3faa	The only way you can legally withhold your rent for repairs is if you wrote them a specific letter stating that you were doing so. This is above and beyond any letters or phone calls that you made to get the repairs done.   Also, you have to either be saving the withheld rent or using it to get the necessary repairs done.  If and when they serve you with an eviction notice you need to contest it so that you can go to court and state your side of the situation.   You are going to need to bring with you any & all documents showing them that you tried to get the management company to take care of the repairs. And also that you either have the money you have been withholding or you have the receipts to show that you paid to have the repairs done out of the rent that you withheld.  As long as you have these documents no judge is going to let them evict you and put that on your record.|`|h1m17rStaa	Get your behind into housing court.  You don't want even the beginnings of an eviction on your record.  And unless your lease is expiring in two weeks as well, you'll still be liable for rent after you move out.    The court can set deadlines to get the items fixed, and protect you from financial damages from the landlord in the meanwhile.  It's quick and relatively easy and cheap.    And remember, whoever has the most documentation in a clear fashion will usually win.  So get all your letters, records, etc.. and get to it.|`|9WbBGwk8aa	The first thing to do is to go to the housing authority of your state and see what are your rights as a tenant. And you need to be faster than them and call the sheriff dpt or the police and let them know what's going on. I don't know what state you live in but here in Maryland you can't evict someone without giving them at least a 30 days notice. Check and see i'm pretty sure it's the same thing there. And make sure that you have copies of all the letters you sent them when you are going to the police. They can't just evict you if you didn't fail to pay the rent but withheld it because THEY weren't doing their job. I had the same problem with my property manager  (they wouldn't fix my diswasher) but when i threatened to stop paying rent, i woke up the following morning to not only a fixed dishwasher but a new one. So it's my belief that it's your right as a tenant to do it and in no way can they evict you based solely on that. So run and put the law on your side b4 they do because as you know the person who calls the police gets to do the talking when they get there. Good Luck.

They do business in most states and are your best opportunity for someone to say yes.

There's no restrictions on that, as long as you can qualify.    It had better be at least a year since you took that FHA loan, though.  You don't want HUD accusing you of using their product to buy an investment property pretending it would be owner-occupied.  Generally, you're expected to occupy the home within 60-90 days, and live in it for 1 year.  After that, there's nothing they can really do about you moving out and renting it.|`|2C29b3Gbaa	Yes you can purchase another home and let them know you intend on occupying this new purchase as your primary residence. and yes probably should be over 1 year or HUD will think you pulled a scam on them.

P5jxbUZyaa	Acorn.org is similar to some of the other homebuyer programs out there (like American Dream).  The mortgage rates are good, but there are other fees involved with the mortgage.  For example, there was a program I looked into a little over two years ago similar to acorn.org (sorry I forgot the name), but I would have had to pay an additional $100 a month for 3 years over my mortgage.  That would have put my payment at $75 more than the mortgage I currently pay.    Look at all of the facts before you decide.

cMt1seRPaa	Yes, most analysts recommend that you hold these two stocks, but of course you can't always take their word on it, but that seems to be the general consensus.     I would hold for a few months and see what they do.      www.marketwatch.com has a lot of good info on DPZ and EYE  read the press releases and look at their annual figures|`|7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	Personally, I take what the analyst's are saying with a grain of salt.  They are usually late to the table.    DPZ  Technically, DPZ has been falling at a rapid rate of decent the last month, but could be hitting a support level at today's low of 18.20.  The next support is at 17.54. Fundamentally, the PE/earnings growth for this year is terrible and next year doesn't look too promising.  I wouldn't be a buyer at this point and if I was in the money I'd take some off the table.    EYE  Lots of insider selling going on and a pretty high short interest of 7.2%.  EYE is at the 1 year support level.  You're down about 6% at this point.  This quarter's earnings shows some good improvement over the last 3 quarters, however the PEG for FY2007 is not so hot.  The debt/equity also is in the yellow zone.      You're down 6%.  If is holds at the current support level, hand on.  If it drops another 3-4%, you'll have to decide how much pain you can take.    Good luck.  ---

Follow that up with Peter Lynch's "Beating the Street". That should provide you with two strategies that you can learn from in building your own investment strategy.    Other good books include "The Motley Fool Investment Guide" by Tom and Dave Gardner or "Real Money" by James Cramer.    I have read all these books and many others and devised a strategy that adopts a bit from each one.     Another thing you can do is invest using a fictional portfolio. Let that run for a few months to see if you are ready to start trading with real money. In the meantime, invest in mutual funds. Once you are ready, sell the fund and invest on your own.    Remember, the time spend learning about investing is far less then the money lost by not being prepared.  ...|`|vaLKpcynaa	You can create yor own portfolio on moneycentral.msn.com:    Link below:    http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/con...
7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	First, the stock must have good fundamentals.  For good ideas on searching for stocks with good fundamentals, look at William ONeils book called "How to Make Money in Stocks." This book combines fundamental analysis and technical analysis and teaches that the best thing to do is to use both strategies together. I am sure, you can find this book in libraries, and you may read it if you are interested.    Next, screen for stocks with good technicals.  I use Telechart to screen the 7000+ stocks in the universe, but there are also many good stock screens available online. From there I narrow the selection down to what I call myUniverse of Stocks to approximately 2500. This screen is based on...  Price > $5  90 day Volume > 250,000  Capitalization > $100M    From here I use multiple screens to narrow my selection down to several hundred by choosing for instance...  Relative Strength >70  MoneyStream >70  Profit Margin in the upper 50th percentile  Revenue Growth  Earnings Growth  PEG     Once I have my selection I look at the charts for a good buying opportunity...  MACD crossing above the zero line  Stochastics are not overbought  Good Industry in good Sector (Top 20% industries)    After this, your selection is down to a dozen or so, and for these I check the recent news, Schwab ratings, MSN ratings, etc.    ---|`|5exPk273aa	Investing in "individual" stocks takes a lot of knowledge and practice; so I would not suggest doing this until you understand completely how the stock markets work.    Instead visit Vanguard.com and learn about mutual funds, index funds, and exchange-traded-funds (ETFs). Trading funds is less risky than trying to trade "individual" stocks.    Unless you plan on spending everyday of your life looking at stock charts trying to determine the best time to get in and out of "individual" stocks, I would look into some sort of fund.

If they take less than that then they will lose more money then they have probably already lost on the house. As to why they won't budge on the terms, they probably are using that to gauge how serious the buyer is. In their minds, If somone can't meet the up front costs then that would likely mean they'll be left holding the bag on another foreclosure for this house. I hope you get it.     PS..... Paying the points up front will buy you a better interest rate so it might be worth it.|`|dYPvwm3laa	The bank is playing this game because the manager and the loan officer in their department doesn't want to have to report a loss on their shift .

We have a bank foreclosure in our neighborhood that has been on the market for about a year .

S4swOoyDaa	I work at Quicken Loans, so I thought I should answer your question.     First of all, you'll need to confirm this with a mortgage banker, but I doubt you'll be able to qualify for anything close to $170,000 mortgage on a salary of $1,300 a month or less.  My guess is that you are paying around $450 a month in rent and when you saw or heard an ad for the Secure Advantage loan, you figured it might be affordable.  But you have to understand that determining what you can qualify for with a mortgage is very different than what you can afford to pay for rent.    The Secure Advantage is a loan that offers payment options.  The lowest option is what's called a "deferred-interest" payment.  What that means is that the payment doesn't cover any of the principal of the loan and only a partial amount of the interest due.  The difference is then added to your principal.  And the option to pay only the minimum lasts for 10 years or until the principal owed grows to 115% of the original amount borrowed.      But you can't qualify for a Secure Advantage based on the minimum payment only.  You have to be able to afford more than the minimum payment.  In fact, I tell people I know that they should only get a Secure Advantage if they can afford any of the payments and choose (for various reasons) to make the minimum payment every so often.  Salespeople on commission are a good example.  They may have a bad month and only pay the minimum amount, but then have a great month and make a full payment (with principal and interest).      Remember, having an option to pay the minimum amount is much different than only being able to afford the minimum.  And because of that, you most likely wouldn't be able to qualify for a Secure Advantage Loan for $170k.      I recommend getting in touch with a mortgage professional and have them go over your credit, income, debts, and they'll tell you what you qualify for.  It's probably going to be a lot less than $170k, but you won't know until you talk to a professional.    So finally, I guess I have to say I do recommend you wait to get a mortgage if you are looking in the $150k and up range.  Whether you get a fixed-rate loan or opt for another type is up to you, but you need to make sure you can afford a home.   You may have to wait until you graduate and make more income.    I've included a link the Secure Advantage page on the Quicken Loans site.      Take care and let me know if you have any questions.|`|h1m17rStaa	Those loans are not for everyone.  In fact, they shouldn't be for almost anyone.    The real rate on those loans is always higher than a comparable 5 year ARM.  And more than a 30 year fixed.    Every month you pay $450, you'll actually add $470 to your loan balance.  After the first year, you'll owe $5600 more than you did when you took the loan out.    Homes aren't appreciating much if at all in most markets right now.  How are you planning to afford a refinance (which costs about $5K on a $170K loan), when you won't have any equity since you spent your equity to make tiny monthly payments instead.    Also, these don't do 100% financing.      I'd look elsewhere.  There's many better products available, and if you can't afford to repay the loan over 30 years, like on a 30 fixed mortgage, you probably shouldn't buy it in the first place.    Plus, they will qualify you on at least the interest-only payment of $920, plus taxes and insurance.  That'll put you at around 80-90% of your gross monthly income towards housing alone.  Meaning you won't qualify anyway.|`|ABoo1doVaa	That loan is what's called a neg am loan. You are going to owe more than what you borrowed when you go to refinance, so if you pay too much for the house or the market drops, you could have some serious problems.
7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	A bearish reversal or otherwise called 3 black crows are 3 consecutive big down days after a top.  The candlestick rules are ...  1. Three consecutive long black days  2. Each day closes at a new low  3. Each day opens withing the body of the previous day  4. Each day closes near its low    This is a strong candlestick indicator with no confirmation required for the reversal pattern.    Another less strong candlestick is Two Crows, where  1. The trend continues with a long white day  2. The 2nd day is a gap up and a black day  3. The 3rd day is also black.    Two black crows is not as strong a reversal pattern as 3 black crows above.  For the 2 crows, a confirmation signal is suggested.    Finally, another strong, but not as strong as the 3 black crow pattern is Three Outside Down.  With this pattern no confirmation signal is required.  The rules (pattern) for this is...  1. An engulfing pattern is formed using all of the previously set rules  2.

If you are talking about capital gains taxes, if you just bought the property in January your home has probably not increased in value by that much and therefore there will not be much in capital gains that you would have to pay.

Since the investor requires 6%, then 1000 compounded semi-annually is 1604.71 for the remaining 8 years of the bond life.    Now the bond pays 4.5%, so 1000 at 4.5% is 1427.62.

They have now been replaced by Digital Duplicators, scanners, laser printers and photocopiers, but for many years they were the primary means of reproducing documents for mass distribution.    Like the typewriter, these machines were children of the second phase of the industrial revolution which started near the end of the 19th century. The second phase of the industrial revolution is also called the Second Industrial Revolution. This second phase brought to mass markets things like the small electric motors and the products of industrial chemistry without which the duplicating machines would not have been economical. By bringing greatly increased quantities of paperwork to life the duplicating machine and the typewriter gradually changed the forms of the office desk and transformed the nature of office work.
7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	To calculate PEG, take PE and divide it by earnings growth.  Most PEGs are you see are based on 5 years growth, unless otherwise stated.  This to me is too far into the future.  It's hard enough to guess earnings growth for this year and next, much less 5 years down the road.    So, I digress.  If you want to calculate PEG for this year and next, take the current PE and go to MSN website for one...    http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/inv...    Look at the earnings estimates growth rates for 07 and 08 in the last 2 columns.  For example, HON with a PE of 21 will have a PEG of  PEG this year = 21/22=0.95  PEG next year= 21/13.5=1.56    If PEG Great  If PEG between 1 and 2 ==> Caution  If PEG > 2 ==> Red Flag.  ---|`|2WVFdO92aa	The PEG is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the projected growth rate over the next few years. (The projected growth rate can vary depending on who is making the projection). A PEG ratio of 1 usually means the stock is fairly priced. A PEG ratio greater than 2 usually means the stock is overpriced (the price has gotten ahead of the earnings). You need to consider PEG with a grain of salt, just as you would earning projections.|`|212477d42ca44f5c2b824e042233ad47aa	The PEG ratio is a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company's expected future growth.    A lower ratio is "better" (cheaper) and a higher ratio is "worse" (expensive). A PEG ratio that gets close to 2 or higher is generally believed to be expensive, that is, the price paid appears to be too high relative to the estimated future growth in earnings.    It is generally accepted that a PEG ratio of 1 represents a reasonable trade-off between cost (as expressed by the P/E ratio) and growth: the stock is reasonable valued given the expected growth. If a company is growing at 30% a year, for example, then the stock's P/E could be as high as approximately 30. PEG ratios between 1 and 2 are therefore considered to be in the range of normal values.    The PEG ratio is commonly used and provided by various sources of financial and stock information. The PEG ratio is only a rule of thumb despite its wide use, and has no accepted underlying mathematical basis; the PEG ratio's validity at extremes in particular (when used, for example, with low-growth companies) is highly questionable. It is generally only applied to so-called growth companies (those growing earnings significantly faster than the market).|`|pabhNRu7aa	You can't use PEG to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued - only overpriced or underpriced relative to other stocks of its kind.    There is a major difference between a stock's price and the underlying company's value. The value of the company is its "net worth" and any future cash it can generate. The stock price is a supply-and-demand price set by traders and gamblers. At any given time, the price can be higher, lower, or equal to the company's value.    I assume you are asking because you want to know how to value a stock and determine whether or not you are overpaying or underpaying - and hence, whether or not your investment has a chance at growing or not in the long-term.    If that is the case - forget PEG, PE, and earnings altogether. Earnings is the number the company reports on its tax return. It has nothing to do with the actual financial performance of the business. Think about it: Is your tax return an accurate reflection of your personal financial performance?    Instead, look at free cash flow - the cash the business can generate from its operations. No business can survive (or grow) for long if it can't generate cash from its operations. Conversely, no company ever went out of business because it generated too much cash.    Take a look at my blog post (below) to see The Importance Of Valuing A Stock, then click around to see a valuation of Johnson & Johnson and (coming tomorrow) a look at Research In Motion - Wall Street's most recent favorite.    Hope that helps.

The  Pre-Market Indicator is an index of trading activity based on pre-market open prices. The PMI was developed  to help gauge pre-market trends leading into the trading day as a predictor of opening prices.     The PMI is based on stocks being bought and sold during premarket hours and is used as a gage for market opening.  It is primarily based on supply and demand -- volume.  ---|`|Fd0Oq0K9aa	By the buying and selling of the different stocks in premarket. Also volume.

An ECN is an electronic order matching system in which investors and other market participants may participate.    Due to the nature of the extended hours trading market, trading through an ECN may pose certain risks which are greater than those present during standard market hours. These risks include ...  lack of liquidity  greater price volatility and price spreads  limited access to other markets and market information  price variance from standard market hours  time and price prioritization of orders  communication delays.     These risks may prevent your order from being executed, in whole or in part, or from receiving as favorable a price as you might receive during standard market hours.    Caveat Emptor.

Someone who owns that stock will try to unload it in premarket trading.  A buyer who has a different anticipation will try to pick it up cheap.    Or maybe a trader wants to get a volatile stock low and then sell it on the bounce.    Sometimes traders will simply try to make a cheap buy and submit a low bid in after hours or premarket trading.   I've done that and a couple of times bought a stock I didn't really expect to buy.

Follow that up with Peter Lynch's "Beating the Street". That should provide you with two strategies that you can learn from in building your own investment strategy.    Other good books include "The Motley Fool Investment Guide" by Tom and Dave Gardner or "Real Money" by James Cramer.    I have read all these books and many others and devised a strategy that adopts a bit from each one.     Another thing you can do is invest using a fictional portfolio. Let that run for a few months to see if you are ready to start trading with real money. In the meantime, invest in mutual funds. Once you are ready, sell the fund and invest on your own.    Remember, the time spend learning about investing is far less then the money lost by not being prepared.  ---|`|Fd0Oq0K9aa	Need to know bid ask. Pe ratio Dividend Ex dividend date.

First of all, I hope you don't plan to make a "killing in the market".  With $700 you could not even by 100 shares of a stock at $10 and if you were really good (or lucky), you may make a few bucks, but the commissions (even if only a few bucks) will severely eat into your profits (or add to your losses).    My recommendation for you is to...  Find a mutual fund with a low minimum (so you can start investing with only $700). Once again, look for a mutual fund with no transaction fees and are no load.  Choose a good mutual fund. Look at the 1, 3, and 5 year performance charts.    Every month, whether the market goes up or down, invest $100 or $200 in that mutual fund. You can set it up so everything is done automatically for you.    You'll be surprised how much you have in your account after 5 or 10 years.  ---|`|3q0BpxVAaa	Do you already have money set aside in high-yield savings, money markets, cd's, mutual funds? If not then you should first invest in some other area. Once you have the savings then get into investing. The reason being, if you have no savings, and you need the money for an emergency, you may have to get out quickly. This could mean losses that you can not afford. Mutual funds are good for first time investors. But really not any better than stocks (this is personal opinion only). I prefer investing in stocks rather than mutual funds.   I think it is great that you want to get started in stocks, but be aware that you could lose this money. Anyone who tells you that they have never lost money in the market has a) never really traded or b) is lying.  So never invest what you would not be comfortable losing.  Just to clarify there is a difference between trading and investing. If you want to invest your money, this means for the long term and you are willing to wait out dips for long term returns.  If you want to be a trader be prepared to say goodbye to that $700 and realize you may be starting from scratch again soon. Traders aren't really interested in the company. The may buy on news,  earnings, technical indicators, because a stock screen says its time to buy,  or on reports. I would put the money into an investment and make some paper trades before starting it will at least help reduce the risk.   I use scottrade - though  I think etrade is less expensive. Zecco is a new site. I'm waiting to see if they are around long. Haven't been in business a year yet, but have zero fee trades (they make their money on margin accounts).

Very few lenders anywhere allow cash-out on lots.    You could try IndyMac, they're a national lender that offers lot loans.  You won't get $30K, maybe $28K (80% loan to value), probably less than that though.|`|xDNEKGZFaa	Typically, 80% loan to value is about the max on land.  Many lenders won't  touch raw land, and, using it to take cash out is more difficult than a purchase.  Get the Yellow Pages out and start calling.  If they won't lend, ask for a suggestion as to who might do it.   A lender located near the land would be more likely to do so as they would be familiar with its potential or problems.

Basically, you're making multiple payments thruout the month instead of a lump sum at the end of the month.  It works on the compounding principle.    http://www.u1stfinancial.com/Default.asp...    Everyone knows that if you split your payment and pay half at the first and half at the middle of the month, you'll save quite a bit of interest over the length of the loan.  If you do this weekly, you'll save even more.  If you know Excell you can set this up in a spreadsheet to determine the effect.    The only information I couldn't find, is how much do they charge you to do this.  Depending on the fee, it could be a good way to go.  ...|`|JKhuudqLaa	here's a site i can highly recommend for you. give it a shot!
h1m17rStaa	Makes zero difference, as you've described it.    A true bi-weekly payment plan pays in every two weeks.  This is different from twice a month.  There's 52 weeks, 26 bi-weeks, 13 monthly payments made under a bi-weekly plan.    Paying half twice a month still only pays 12 payments per year.      A bi-weekly plan can knock 8 years off a 30 year loan.  Paying it off in the same time it would normally only be paid down to 50% of your balance.  Yep, that's right.  It takes about 21-22 years for a normal 30 year mortgage to pay off by half.  1 extra payment per year will pay it off 100% in the same 21-22 years.    Most bi-weekly plans have ridiculous extra costs, though.  $5-10 charge every 2 weeks.  Some want $300-500 upfront to set it up.  If you aren't paid bi-weekly as well, if you ever overdraft, there's another $35.  And, most lenders don't apply the extra money until it equals one full payment anyway, so you aren't getting real-time reduction of principal the whole time.  They make interest on your money until they decide to apply it.    Best thing to do, if you want to pay off your loan early, is to simply divide your monthly payment by 12.  Add that amount to your payment, every month.  In 12 months, you'll have made 13 payments, and saved money on interest and accelerated your payoff.  Without any risk.|`|c3186f0f5c64761229ed6a56a18a85bcaa	If you pay bi-weekly, or every two weeks, you will end up paying one extra payment per year, which will cut down the amount of time it takes to pay off your mortgage.

They will usually charge you a fee.    The best thing to do is to pay as much as you can extra towards the principal each month when the bill is due.|`|3apK8Lyfaa	Many lenders charge a fee for this kind of set up.

Let's take an example. Let's say a homeowner has a $150,000 mortgage, $1,300 payment at 7.0% for 30 years. By simply converting the monthly payment of $1,300 to a Split-Mortgage Payment of $650 on a bi-weekly basis, the homeowner pays 26 one-half payments over the year, or the equivalent of 13 monthly payments. Through the use of sophisticated banking technology and electronic debiting the homeowner automatically makes an extra payment of $650 to principal ever 6 months toward the mortgage. The result? The homeowner saves an amazing $60,550 in interest (over a 33% savings!) and owns their home free and clear in just 22.5 years!
7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	There's not a huge difference between compounding weekly and monthly, unless of course, you're dealing with big numbers.

h1m17rStaa	The situation you are describing is increasingly common.  Banks are getting people who are buying two second (vacation) homes on the same block, loans being sold to them by different brokers at the same time.      Occupancy is a major source of fraud right now.  Everyone seems to think it's perfectly ok to lie to the banks about their intentions on living in a property, so they can save money on rate and downpayment and have worse credit but still qualify.    I've had to jump through hoops for all my clients when they currently own a home, don't sell, but want to buy a new one in the area.    The presumption is that you'd only move to improve your housing situation.  So common red flags are a smaller or inferior home as the new one.    And banks can and do check your occupancy after closing.  At closing, you'll likely be required to sign an occupancy affidavit swearing that you'll move in within 60 days and stay for 12 months.  Lie on that and you're automatically in default on your loan, they can foreclose on you and sue you, and submit you for prosecution as well.    If you're truly intending on moving into the new place, do your best to put your intentions on paper, sign it, and cross your fingers.  Talk about your plans to rent your current home.  Start marketing for tenants and show them the ads.  If you're sincere, you should find  a way to get that across.

They basically need written proof to underwrite the loan as a primary residence as opposed to an investment property, which increases the risk, rate, and might require a larger down payment as well.

0awnte3Uaa	The flex 100 program is just a fancy name for a 100% mortgage loan. There is nothing to concern yourself about with interest only and such, especially if you have told your mortgage professional that you simply want a traditional 30 year fixed rate mortgage. With LPMI, the lender is paying for your mortgage insurance each year with the money they are making from charging you a higher interest rate than what you would have qualified for. Thus, with LPMI you will not pay PMI. However, with PMI you can obtain a better rate but you will have to pay the PMI yourself. Before LPMI would have been the better option. However, now that PMI is fully tax deductible, PMI is probably the better option as it will give you a bigger tax write off and you can get rid of it once you have 20% equity in your home. With LPMI you are stuck with the higher rate for the life of the loan.   There should not be any prepayment penalties on this loan, however it is something you should ask about because it is up to the lender. You can pay off the loan quicker just as if you had a 95% loan instead. There really is very little difference between the 95% and the 100% Flex. The main difference is going to be that you will be financing more money obviously with 100% and your PMI level will be higher or the rate adjustment for the LPMI will be slightly higher than at it would at 95%.   Remember ask about whether there is a pre-payment penalty and make sure your LO is placing you on a 30 year fixed making principal and interest payments if you are concerned that he/she is putting you on an interest only. Good luck and actually the rate and everything sounds quite fair for 95-100% financing.|`|h1m17rStaa	So, your rate is 6.5% PLUS LPMI?      You're right that LPMI (paid for through a higher interest rate)doesn't go away the same way borrower-paid MI (BPMI) would.    And for loans originated in 2007, BPMI is now tax-deductible if you make less than $100K.    The Flex 100 product is a Fannie Mae program.  Fannie doesn't charge prepay penalties on their products.    Don't try the biweekly thing though.  Too many problems with it, and you don't really get the benefits you think you are, in most cases.  If you want to pay extra, divide your payemnt by 12, then add that amount to each monthly payment.  You'll still pay 13 payments per year, without the hassles.    And if you don't think you can trust your loan officer, perhaps you need another? http://www.dca.state.ga.us/  Here's  link to the GA housing finance agency.  Contact them.

She would then be getting paid by the mortgage company from the reverse mortgage, collecting money from you and you would be giving her 30k up front that she would be getting. If you are seriously interested in this home, I strongly recommend you retain an attorney to help you. You can probably get an attorney to help you out for as little as a couple hundred dollars. Once ownership interest in a home changes at all for a person with a reverse mortgage they have to immediately notify the lender at which time. Wells Fargo specializes and is an industry leader when it comes to Reverse Mortgages. Contact someone at Wells Fargo and explain the exact situation and see what they think if you want to save the attorney fee.|`|h1m17rStaa	Reverse mortgages never have monthly payments that need to be made.

But you'd still have to comply with truth in lending. If she defaults, or you fail to make the payments she could sue your pants off for breach of contract. If you stand "second", which I think this is the case, then you'd better be very careful. Depending on the mortgage you could be left out in the cold if the first files a default before you do.
0awnte3Uaa	There are other factors involved in determining an interest rate besides credit score. However, based on a 30 year fixed rate with a score near 800 a good rate would be in the low to mid 6's right now. The near 800 score does not really do much more for you than if you had say, a 680 score in terms of mortgage lending.    If you had less than stellar credit, this is much harder to determine a rate without knowing all of the details as this could range anywhere from say 7.5% up to 12+%.|`|GcyKSQFhaa	7.5, but I wouldn't go higher than 6.8|`|h1m17rStaa	Going rate for a 30-year fixed right now is probably in the 6.5-6.75% range.  Add .25-.50% more if you need 100% financing.

h1m17rStaa	Dump your broker.  Start calling around to local banks and credit unions.  Find your own HELOC.    Brokers make little to nothing on HELOC's.  We really offer them as a necessary function, but ideally when we're doing a first mortgage too, where we can make a decent income from.    Now, is that a 40 year first mortgage you're being offered at 9.5%?  That's not terrible for a 95% HELOC, as it would only be Prime + 1.25%, but it sucks as a first mortgage.    Get rid of this guy.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	Well, here is what they are not telling you.    It's not that Illinois doesn't allow them, it's that the state most likely changed the laws that put so many restrictions on how a HELOC has to be written, that it no longer makes it profitable for the bank, as well as may too-easily open doors for a bank to be accused of predatory lending.    In my career, I have seen 2nd loans stopped in New Jersey, Utah, Texas, Florida, etc...they always return, but when the laws change, sometimes the legal department will advise a bank to stop underwriting them temporarily until they can get a better idea of how the legalities work, and how to write a legal loan that you don't get sued over...and then educate employees accordingly, build it into our automated underwriting system, etc.    Does that sound like alot?  Yup..and most people don't understand it...that is why they blame it on the state, b/c it's easier.    Just wait it out...give it about 6 months and lenders will start offering something comparable.

h1m17rStaa	It's absolutely brutal at the moment.  The entire mortgage market is in a huge turmoil right now.  Every day, another lender goes bankrupt.  Every day, another product gets pulled from the market, often without regard to the fact that you've already sold a client into that product.  Even A+ full-doc jumbo loans aren't able to be sold to Wall Street right now.    You can still do conventional and government loans just fine, but that's it.  And it won't get any better for a while.    It's not impossible, but these market conditions have never been this bad before, so it's probably not a good time to jump back in.|`|BJe74zEBaa	Props to Michigan Ted!!  I'm gonna close 8 loans this month.  Last month was the best month I've ever had with 15 loans.  The world is what you shape it!|`|O6AZ4j1Kaa	Prior to March I was closing about 5 - 6 files a month. Now it's more like 1 or 2 (if that). The market is super bad. If you can stay at home for a while without really having a financial strain then I suggest you wait it out. If you have to go back to work then you might want to consider other fields.     Good luck!|`|DmZxs9E4aa	The market is meaningless.  I am on track to close 11 loans in Michigan this month - and you don't get a much worse environment than ours these days.    There is always room in this industry for people who are not afraid to work.  It's the cherry-pickers who get spoiled during re-fi booms that get crushed during the tougher times.    If you believe in yourself, I can think of no better time to walk in the front door than when all of the cowards are running out.
h1m17rStaa	Find a broker who understands credit re-scoring.      With a 620 score, that MI should drop substantially, to less than $150.      It's often as simple as paying off 1 credit card, or even sometimes paying it down to less than half the limit.      I've done that numerous times.  Last time, MI dropped from $280/mo. to under $140.      PS if you put even 3% down, perhaps an FHA loan would be a good solution?  Rates are good (6.5-7%), MI would be about $70/mo.  FHA has no minimum credit scores or risk-based pricing yet.|`|itoAz2mLaa	I lend across the country no way PMI is 550.00 per month.   I can do a loan for you with no PMI.

AA12257018	It must be an assignable purchase contract. It's legal in the US. They basically got a great deal on the property and are flipping the purchase contract to another buyer. Look at the contract to see if it says "and/or assigns" after the buyer's name. If it does, it's an assignable contract.    Regards|`|AA12059806	They must be pretty confident their buy offer will go thru smoothly or they wouldn't be relisting it already. HOWEVER, I don't see how they can get in to show it, since they DO NOT own it yet - Unless the real estate agent got approval from the current owner to do it|`|AA11514788	They clearly cannot sell the property until such time as they have title to it. I suppose they can be showing it (provided the owner allows them to), but any contract would have to be contingent on them first closing.|`|XfKbOuGfaa	I am not sure how it works in Canada, but it's not legal in the US. We call it "flip" purchase. If the mortgage company knows about this, they will never finance this "flip" guy. It's against the law.    You should let the original seller know about this. The original has the right to cancel the agreement with the first offered people. No sellers want to be involved in this illegal transaction.     The best you can do is to keep all the evidences and consult with a Loan Officer or a Real Estate Lawyer to make sure it's illegal in Canada before discussing about this with the original seller.|`|XVeU5eWaaa	they can sell the  purchase contract, thats the contract between them and the current owners for the purchase of the house, or they could legally take an offer on the house while its in escrow|`|h1m17rStaa	Unless their purchase contract specifically allows them to assign their right to buy to another party, they would have to take possession first, then sell it.    Doesn't mean they can't try to market it in the meanwhile, but they'd be foolish to do so if they can't perform when the time comes.
QIPuSe8zaa	Employment is only one of the things that is looked at to determine your ability to puchase things or to get loans.   In her case she does have income because she get the rental income from the property so being unemployed doesn't mean she doesn't have income.  The value of the property and the cash flow of the rental property will determine what she can borrow.|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	No, she can't. That is predatory lending.    If she does not have the means to pay back the loan, other than someone foreclosing on her house, then that is lending on assets only, and only someone very, very unethical would loan your mother the money.    You can only rob Peter to pay Paul for so long...b/c eventually Peter is going to have nothing left to take.    Your mother needs to not be greedy and wait until the house is paid off and then sell it if she wishes.  Someone else worked hard to provide that for her.|`|h1m17rStaa	She might be able to qualify for a "no doc" loan.  Although, that specific type of loan is now in the spotlight as a major cause of the financial turmoil on Wall Street.  Many investors have suspended those products right now.  But start asking around, eventually they'll come around.
h1m17rStaa	Yep, probably.      That language is in many contracts.  In your case, is there anything the engineer can't get clear access to inspect?      In real estate, for example, a home inspector can rarely inspect a snow-covered roof in winter.  That's one thing that he'd like to be exempted from liability for if there turned out to be defects.|`|AA10091923	yes...it is binding in any court or official document.  it is basically a clause so that they cannot be held responsible if there is a deficiency.  the structural engineer most probably did not work with the architect on this project...and he did not certainly build it...  however, he has reviewed all plans and most probably looked at and accessed the structure...and "to the best of his knowledge" it seems correct.    if there are ever any liability issues...those would need to go back on the original architect and builder.      good luck  :)|`|0lxTYhWSaa	Yes it is legally binding and you would find that if you read that contract you probably do not have great recourse again the engineer anyway.
h1m17rStaa	That rumor has been around a while now.  I believe they've talked, but nothing has happened yet.    It could happen overnight though now, since CW is having liquidity troubles right now.

Sorry if you do not agree.|`|W4mj7UE8aa	B of A will not buy Countrywide, nor will any other conglomerate. Countrywide just took out $11.5 billion worth of loans to fund their operations, which means whomever buys Countrywide will also inherit that debt. Plus that rumor has been floating around since January. There were initial talks between the two sides where BofA would leverage Countrywide's mortgage model and Countrywide would operate under BofA's federal bank charter.
xYGIviuWaa	the apr shows all the fees added to the loan and the yield spread if your rate is that much higher id say your broker added to the rate to get a yield spread! (more money form bank that you wont see)  they generally say thats just all the fees added not to worry about it.  its total bull puckey    what you are seeing is the differance between what you could have gotten in rate and what you ended up paying.    now dont get me wrong some of this increase is the other fees but considering they are looking at the total anual percentage rate. those are minimal to the change the biggest is the rebate the broker charged you!    Consider this!  if you pay just 1% more for your home of 200k  thats 2k a year for 30 years or 60k  now everyone knows you pay mostly interest for the first 10 years so youll be paying off that extra 60k so the broker could make 2k.........  doesnt seem fair but its done all the time and most borrowers are not aware they could have gotten a better deal!|`|8RVFJipJaa	When shopping for a mortgage, it is important to consider rate and costs. The APR is a way for you to shop for a loan by looking at one number. The APR is your interest rate plus any fees you may incur that you wouldn't otherwise spend if you paid cash for the house.|`|h1m17rStaa	APR on a fixed rate loan is ALWAYS higher than your note rate of interest.    A few major items affect APR:    1. Note rate - the actual rate your payments are calculated on.  2. Closing costs - some affect APR, some don't.  Ask your lender for details.  3. Mortgage insurance.  MI is factored into the APR calculation.  With a 5% downpayment, MI is generally about .75%.  But, it doesn't last all 30 years, more like 12 (based on standard amortization).  So that could easily add maybe .4-.5% to your APR.      I wouldn't get too bent out of shape about APR.  If your note rate is good, terms are otherwise favorable, it really doesn't mean that much to you.      Closing at the end of the month vs. the beginning will lower your APR.  Which is silly, but true.  Point is, it's not necessarily the most important part of your overall offer.|`|AA12017310	interest compounds on top of itself.  So, if you are paying 5% on something, the actual interest rate is higher because on the next statement period you are paying interest on the interest that accrued from the previous period.    Same thing works for savings accounts, too.  If you are being paid 5%, you are actually receiving more because you will be paid interest on the interest you earned the previous period.  At the end of the year since you earned interest on the interest you were paid, it comes to slightly over 5%.
GMNvNGV9aa	Yes...Make sure you use an FHA licensed broker with that score...|`|h1m17rStaa	You'd be eligible for an FHA loan.  Usually, you have to wait 2 years post-BK, but with documented medical issues, it can be as short as 1 years.  FHA has no minimum credit score.    Make sure you can document 12 months cancelled checks for your rent.  Have 3 other utilities you pay no more than 30 days late to show other tradelines.  You'll need a 3% downpayment.      If you have VA eligibility, that'd work too, with 0 downpayment.|`|m6dHS7goaa	There are hundreds if not thousands of websites on the internet enumerating the ways to apply and receive home loan when you are plagued with bad credit issues.

BJe74zEBaa	Subprime is the only division that uses bank statements at this point.  At 90% ltv, my rates would probably be around9% but you'd have to pay a couple of points.  95% is probably the same, but there' s a good chance if you can use bank statements I could go 100%.|`|add61e7f392d967df0fd959ed324c63baa	The rate is higher as it sounds like they are doing one loan to finance this property.  Any loan over 80% LTV would result in a higher interest rate if there was not a second loan added on the property.      I would shop around (with a mortgage broker) an office that deals with several different lenders instead of a mortgage banker ( in house lender like Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo, etc.).    Another thing to remember:  Most likely this loan will have a pre-payment penalty (an extra fee if the loan is paid off early) ask the loan officer about that.   When signing loan documents always look at the promissory note (it will be under if you pay the loan off early - it will list the term and cost to pay it off early).  The pre-payment penalty is generally 6 months worth of interest payments.|`|DmZxs9E4aa	The Alt-A market has all but evaporated in the last few weeks and there are very few lenders offering the program at any rate.    Why does he need to use bank statements for his income documentation?|`|9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	The credit scores are too low...that is why the rates are so high.    They are using his bank statements as income, because evidently he must work at a job where he can't prove enough income to qualify for the loan...that is a common "fix", but you'll pay through the nose in an interest rate for it.|`|h1m17rStaa	The scores aren't really the problem.  It's his inability to document enough income to make the payments using traditional methods, like W-2's and tax returns.    If you took his taxable income, what would his DTI be?  If it's under 65%, he can probably get a Fannie Mae loan right now.  Seriously.
DmZxs9E4aa	Yes it's really a 30 year fixed loan that is eligible for sale to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  FastTrack is just the brand name that your lender uses for either an "Accept Plus" (Freddie) or "Rapid" (Fannie) loan process.  Some places call them "Fast and Easy" some call them "FastTrack" and others call them something else.  It generally means that the credit profile is so favorable that the review process is limited.    The "FastTrack" part has nothing to do with the fact that it is a 30 year fixed conforming loans.|`|h1m17rStaa	Yep.  Fast track just sounds like you skip the step of verifying your income and assets, if your credit and loan to value meet the proper thresholds.    Have you asked if you could get a better rate by documenting your income?|`|BJe74zEBaa	Who did you apply with?  Not sure what a fastrack is but the best way to tell is to request a Good faith estimate or Truth in lending statement.  A lock-in agreement will also tell you.
AA12065007	It will have a positive effect after around 6-months. The best effect will be after 12 -payments have been made as agreed.    The answer to the second part of your question is any thing posted to your account over 30 days late will hurt.|`|h1m17rStaa	It's supposed to take 6 months of reporting before an account rates.  Supposedly.      I don't believe much of anything the bureaus tell us, though.    And late payments don't count until they are 30 days past the due date.      Watch that closely.  I've seen many instances where people paid late enough to get a late fee, and it made it onto their credit report.|`|83d505b3dfdd44c4d7ff0b7e82427ab0aa	Up to three months after the loan is paid in full on both.|`|xI1u6QHGaa	To begin, every situation is a little different.    Secured loans such as a car have a much smaller positive effect on your credit score than insecured ones,  Such as credit cards.    Keeping up with all the payments may over time raise your credit score 20, maybe 50 points.    How many credit cards you have, how long all the accounts have been open, what the balances are in relation to available credit, the number of inquiries. All of these have much more effect than a car loan.    Just keep making your payments and over time it will slowly but surely make a difference.    Every company is little different in the length of time it would take for them to report  anything negative. The best bet would be to not play with fire. Just pay it!|`|dB2vKArEaa	Creditors will report you as paying late if you're more than 30 days past due.  Once reported to the credit reporting agencies, it will negatively impact your credit score.  And it stays on there for a long time - I was 30 days late on a Macy's charge account payment over 3 years ago, and it's still showing on my credit report today.  It sucks.    I can't say for sure how long you'll have to pay before you see an improvement in your credit score, but I'd say it will be at least 6 months.  I believe most creditors report to the crediting reporting agencies every month, so after several months of timely payment, it will reflect positively on your credit score.|`|LjjJS4Buaa	It will take approximately six months of steady on-time payments  to make a difference. As the owner of www.1-800BadCredit.com that is what our lenders tell us. You will have a grace period on your payment contract, most lenders offer a 30 day period before it's late.

If you have had no contact and haven't made a payment for 6 years, then you can ignore it as the company has had enough time to chase the debt and hasn't bothered...if bailliffs are threatening you see the C.A.B....Go today as it'll be quiet because of the snow.|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	In the UK you owe it to you pay it or Die,|`|vl0HWTDJaa	The 6 year rule only applies if you have had no contact with the company whatsoever in over 6 years. This includes them sending you a letter or anything as small as that so I doubt that it's true in your case and if they haven't been able to contact you because you moved house without telling them, it could also mean the debt can still be recovered.    The rule doesn't make the debt non-existent, it just makes them unable to go to court to claim it so you could still have bailiffs coming round but unless they have a court order, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET THEM IN. Just keep all doors and windows locked and don't answer the door to them then they con't take your things. Even if they threaten you with police etc, ignore them.

They may sell the debt to a debt collection agency and they do have the right to send bailiffs.  The worst thing you can do is to sit and wait for them to knock on the door.  Contact the people you owe money to, talk to them and explain the situation.  They'd rather have some money than none at all so agree a payment plan with installments that you can afford and stick to it.

From what you say , the original debt is one which you owed to your bank . They have now legally assigned the debt to a third party and you are being pursued by the third party. If the bank or the third party obtained a judgement against you ( and the reference to Bailiff's suggests that they have ) then the third party can take any legitimate steps to enforce their judgement within 12 years from the date of the judgement.   What you need to do , assuming I have understood the position correctly, is to make an application yourself to the court for the warrant of execution which the third party are seeking to enforce to be suspended and for the debt to be paid off by monthly instalments the amount of which will depend on your financial circumstance. In my experience the court will be very sympathetic to you and you will be able to keep your possessions. You should NOT just ignore the situation. It wont go away and it wont improve by keeping.    Good luck|`|20lCgb6Uaa	Apart from the time bar it is likely that the loan is legally unenforceable anyway.

UclZvIbBaa	Well i was in the same predicament a few years ago but i had a bill from comcast on my credit. so they told me its better to have no credit established then bad credit because u can still get approved  (1st time buyers and etc.) plus as long as you pay your bills on time then ur score will only go up. but may i suggest to at least try getting something small like a sears card or something of that nature. just when you activate it  use your card to get it and make sure you already have the money for it. and soon as you purchase it with the card, mail out the money for the purchase and your score should show good pay and you will have good credit.|`|LJt1uLxnaa	check out your credit for yourself. for 20 bucks or so, its pretty cool. if you need credit, open a credit card, DON'T over spend, keep your balance UNDER 30% of the approved amount.   give it a few months, and boom, you will have awsome credit.   if you can't get one, go to your bank and ask for a "prepaid" credit card (its where you give them 200 bucks or so and use a bit, but keep the balance up to where you first opened it)  good luck
AHCelSY1aa	Sure.  There is nothing illegal about it and in fact the retail industry is one of the worst economically right now.  Your friend should apply for unemployment.  But be warned.  Unfortunately, if he/she is under the age of 19 (in most states) he/she will not be eligible for unemployment.  Also he/she must have worked a minimum of 26 weeks within the last 18 months (even if it was 100 different jobs) to also be eligible.  If he/she doesn't meet these requirements then they need to listen to the mgr.  Start looking for another job.|`|2H4QOwFzaa	Your friend has to talk to her supervisor.  She should go to work and talk to them face to face. If she is paid by the hour, and she signed a contact with them to work from xx date then she is their employee.     They have to give her something in writing if she has been terminated or temporary laid off.  She can then take that notice to the department of employment. They are probably hoping that she quit and they will not have to pay her unemployment insurance.|`|qCXuiPPmaa	Yup its legal, if there's no business how could they pay her.  Only if she sign a contract stating that she is granted 40 hours a week then it would. With retail jobs you can never be sure of work unless it's union.  They prob want to give her the boot, but don't want to officially do it just in case they need her.

Things might seem okay with your friend, but if that person knows you have extra money to burn like that, they might also tamper with your food. Chances are low unlike the total stranger.

BoAEgaAGaa	The IRS was not keeping the $600.  They just did not give you $600 again if you had already received this amount.  The question is in the programming this year to determine if you had received all you were entitled to last year.  Many taxpayers did not receive any or all of the stimulus last year because they had too much income, too little tax liability, or have a new child on their 2008 tax return.  In these cases if they qualify this year they will receive the part they were not eligible for last year as a part of their refund.      Below is an IRS link that discussed the issues that have come up due to the stimulus payments.    I hope this helps.

The reason the economy is in such bad shape is, far to many people spend every penny of their disposable income and everything they can take out of their credit cards.  Do yourself a favour. Find out how much it costs you to live every month. Multiply that by 12 and then get that amount put away into savings. Once you've done that, Then1/2 of what you were putting away each month becomes your disposable income.   But until you have a nest egg, you have no disposable income.  Does this sound harsh, Yeah it is. But if you fall down and break a leg or the company you work for suddenly goes belly up, you'll be thank full you put some money away for a rainy day.

ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	Your credit score can change dramatically over night. You can pay your bills on time and still have a low score due to lack of experience or too much debt to income ratio. Newness of a debt also reports negatively on you score. Most companies look at more than just the score. They will check to see how you pay your current bills. A lack of credit experience isn't the only criteria that is used. It is only one thing that is checked. Only time and paying your bills on time will help your score. Avoid accumulating a lot of debt, especially credit card debt.

Go into the store with a new resume so he has all your info. If he does not know your age, reads the resume, and you are under the minimum, and says sorry you cant work. Then have mom call the labor board and tell them what happend, or have mom call them and get you the hours that you worked paid.  There are places that will take the free help and offer no pay and that is illegal, at least in the US it is. The thing is, when someone says your hired, 99.9 percent of the time, they discuss the job, the hours they need you and your pay per hour. He did not do that right? He did not look and photocopy your ID or social security card right? He broke the law by not doing that. He probably feels he got two free hours of work and thats it. Or he is out sick and the new manager has no idea this is going on. Go up and find out, then take the appropriate measure, no job, you want min wafe for two hours paid right then. Or do the mom thing.

It also shows that person has ambition.  Which is a high quality in an employee.   I wouldn't pester him, but be persistent.    It doesn't sound like you have had an interview.  You might ask him if he would like an interview, so he can find out more about you and also so you can find out more about the position, the store and your prospective boss.   GOOD LUCK !       You have the right to ask questions too.     Find out all you can about that position and what it entails.

DI9wXRVgaa	If the restaurant isn't fine dining and you mean just a standard, nice restaurant, then the others are right:  The host/hostess seats you  Waiter/waitress takes the order  Bus people clean the tables.    In some restaurants, a new person sort of helpd one of the more experienced wait staff - or a new waiter or waitress may start by bussing tables.    Further, when a well run eating establishment is busy it is not unsusual for the hostess, bus people and other wait staff to keep *everyones* drinks filled or help with overflow orders.|`|aHLnNrOGaa	The person who takes your order is a server (sometimes called waitron, waiter or waitress).    The person who actually give you your food is usually a server or a server assistant (busser or bus boy) or a food runner (In rare cases your food may be served to you by any employee like an expediter or maybe a manager or a member of the host staff depending on the situation.  Restaurants can be hectic frequently).    Some places have the servers do all their tables own food service.  Some places have the servers run food for who-ever's orders come up whenever they come up.  This can be more efficient sometimes, but can lead to mistakes because the food is being served by someone that did not take the order.    If there is nothing else... enjoy your dinner.|`|FuiZBluWaa	they are both waiters|`|E9L0HFRSaa	Sommelier - said som-mil-lee-ay,  which means wine steward.|`|AA10042770	when you first enter the place the person who seats you is a host.the person who comes and takes your order is a server.

OK, one more thing.  She should NOT be letting people stay at her place.  THIS guy, stole money.  The next guy, might end up murdering her.  It's a DUMB MOVE.

e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	OK, as you probably realize, the coverage for this can't be bound overnight, and will take a bit of work to get put in place.  You're going to need about two weeks, MINIMUM, so if the NEW guy isn't returning calls, you need to find ANOTHER new agent.  But clearly, the first guy, both has no idea what he's doing (how to place it), AND, isn't really excited about working on your account.    Workers comp is probably going to run about 10% of payroll.  That might be a bit high, but if you use that number, you won't be shocked.  GL is probably going to START at $5,000, and add $500 for each provider.    Employee benefits - group health - will probably run about $400 a person for an individual, $1200 for a family, for a LOW/NO deductible plan - but that varies wildly depending on the average age of your group.      Make SURE that new agent is working on your quote.  Otherwise, you will NOT be opening the doors on March 1st.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	I guess you learned if the agent does not get back to you, move on.    No one where can quote because rates are different in every state and company.    Wait until this 2nd agent gets back to you with a quote.   You might call another agent for a quote too so you will at least have 2 of them.

8b0ff26bd768031b646ac62be8cba69aaa	Can you proved taht you contacted the 401k provider and their response?  Can you prove that you contacted the HR dept and their repsonse?  If either/both will admit to these contacts then there is a resolution. It's called EPCRS.   If a loan goes into default because no loan payments were taken through no fault of the participant (you) then you can go through this program which will allow a correction and no 1099-R and resuting taxation to take place. I would posit to the IRS/DOL (that's who the program is run by) that the loan be reamortized and payments made over the next 52 weeks  as it's the original loan amount and the payment period would still be within the 5 year maximum loan payment window.    There are other technical items to address in the EPCRS filing but your 401k provider can deal with that.  The big thing you need to know is that there may be an answer for you but you'll have to fight for it. EPCRS is not cheap...But if you contacted them and they still did nothing it's certainly worth fighting for.      Be aware that if you don't go the EPCRS route, you can still pay on this loan amount ...you will have an after tax account that when you receive a distribution from the plan will not be taxable.  A headache for the recordkeeper and for you since you'll have to make sure they, and all other recordkeepers after them, keep it seperate from your pre-tax money,  But  you'll still be able to continue the compounding effect of your accounts.  But I'd push on the EPCRS and push HARD!!!!
94faf4d1d380dfc7f0731bbb8873018eaa	I guess it depends on the amount of debt you have run up. Small amounts they may forget as the cost of recovery may be too high. Larger amounts then it may well be worth their trouble. As the interest on credit cards is high, you may want to refinance that debt for a lower cost, say with a bank loan, this way you also have the flexibility to pay back over a longer period.   Be aware the credit card company may sell you debt at a reduced rate to a collection company. They may stop at nothing to collect their money. Also as credit card companies share information, you may not be able to get a new credit card or a loan from any bank. My advise write to the credit card company, explain your position and try to cut a deal, they may be happy knowing they can get at least half their money back. Burying your head in the sand is a bad idea.|`|2dke6ChJaa	just ignore it, you'll be right mate, yeah australia can arrest ya, but we only arrest the kiwis for that one.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	sorry mate but even if your in another country they get you and then you will be facing court or even possible jail time if you cant pay them back|`|hsfdbvF0aa	yes they will arrest you if you try to come back  if you leave it for too long they will find you and you may have to serve time in your own country|`|ipXoIWV2aa	Good day Everybody,     Am David Johnson am from Toronto Canada recently when I was searching for a loan to setup a small business I was recommend to Susfasa Loan Firm by Lisa Jose when I was offer a loan of 50k few days ago so when I was your profile I in yahoo answer I decided to recommend you directly to this faithful man of God his name is Mr. Susfasa Lee you can reach him via e-mail:susfasaloanfirm@live.co.uk or susfasaloanfirm@yahoo.com tell him that David Johnson recommend to him who his offer loan few ago.

dd17NBsUaa	This is a difficult one.  The credit crunch is the banks not lending too each other (or to businesses) as they dont trust each other.  If the proposed plans for a bad bank go ahead, where all the toxic debt is parked in one place, thereby freeing up the banks to lend to each other, the credit crunch will then end.     Even if this happened tomorrow it would take a long time for us to move out of recession.  At the earliest I would expect 12 months of very low interest rates and probably 18 months of recession as a minimum.  The last one was around 4 years.

If the governments of UK and Europe throw lots of money at the credit problem                                         then the resulting pay rises and price rises will make our savings (if any) worth very little.    in my non-expert opinion, now is a good time to try to invest for the future - things which will save money in the long run.

The little people (us) pay the price because 50 P from a few million adds up to a lot more than 5000 from the rich, laugh. Most of the problem is hype, bad news, about as real as the reasons for the high gas prices, based on a touch of reality and mostly so lots of rich people could make millions not because of those reasons but because they can. The credit crunch is a created thing to force some of those rich people back to their places, destroy a few, and make some very rich people richer because they want to be. We non-rich people pay the price in jobs etc. collatereral damage not important to the people in power who are secure in their income source, you.     Back to the predictions, things should ease up in about 6 months, for a while. I believe less the next three months will be rough then I think you will see a real easing, for a while, also quite a few shortages of things you normally could get.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	I agree this is completely unfair, but it is perfectly legal.    My employer is doing the same thing, despite the fact that I work in central London and therefore there was no public transport running yesterday, and I had no choice but to stay home.  I am not sure what the other Answerers are on about who have said that it was a choice not to go to work - perhaps they live in areas where people own cars and that kind of thing, but in central London, if there is no public transport, then you are not going any further than you can walk.  I don't even know anyone who owns a car.    With regard to parental leave, the law is that you are permitted to take as much time off as required to find alternative arrangements for your child.  So, this doesn't mean that you can take the day off yourself - it means that you can take, say, an hour off or however long it takes to take the child to a relative or someone who can watch him/her.  And even this time can be unpaid.    FYI, in the UK an employer does not have to provide you with written terms and conditions until you have been there eight weeks.  So legally, they're correct in that they didn't need to give you a contract yet.    I am not sure about the nursery but I would assume that they have no right to charge you if they were closed.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Who decided that you couldn't go into work yesterday?  If you rang them and said you couldn't come in then yes they can deduct it from your holiday.  If they rang you and said work was closed then no they can't.  I would also advice you to check your contract but it sounds like you might not have received that yet?!  That is illegal you should haves signed a contract before you started work.  The nursery I don't know because they operate on different basis so you need to check what your agreement is with them.|`|89dbd497fcd8c6cdb3d35fd8f19c44e1aa	You decided not to work yesterday, and therefore you can be deducted for holiday.

If the school closes we are not expected to come in and we will still get paid for the day.  If the school stays open but we feel that it is unsafe to come in we may stay home, but it costs us a vacation day.  There have been many times this year that I have gone out in dangerous weather to ensure that I get paid.  Unless your work tells you not to come in they do not have to pay you.    If the day care was closed you should not expect to pay for it, but if it was open you will likely have to foot that bill also.

I generally don't purchase stocks under $5, but these companies are not usually penny stock companies and they seem solid enough to make it through the depression.

Recently a hedge fund used this software and turned just under two million dollars into just over $16 Million!    It's amazing.    Every week this robot analyzes thousands of small cap and penny stock charts and predicts, based on technical analysis of those charts what stock he thinks is poised for a big move upward.      I then email his pick to all members of my newsletter.    Over the last four weeks, my stock bot's picks have resulted in an average of 85.7% Returns.  In fact, if you would have been on my list just a couple of weeks ago, my robot recommended TLLE, overnight the stock went from just 13 cents all the way to over 50 cents a share!    This is far from uncommon.    You can try my robot out free right now at my site:    http://www.DayTradingRiches.com    Good Luck, To your Success!

They control the thermostatic control then they have to turn it on to keep your house warm. If they dint or its broke the need to offer you a alternative form of heating period.

There must be more places to put up your info. Placing this here on YA is very dangerous, I sugest you erase your question before you have som sicko try to contact you and pretend they need your services.

AA10464818	My advice is for you to read more of the business, so you can determine what you think you want and can given your present resources. The book "101 Best Businesses to Start" estimates that first year potential earnings for this business can be $40,000, while startup expenses can be $5,000 or even lower. Industry experts, however, recommend raising $50,000 for a startup capital in order to be able to invest in heavy duty cleaning equipment and have more resources to spend in marketing the business.    You can start by reading the article "Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business" at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janito... . The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business.     From the article, here are some tips to help market your business:    1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer.     2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords - your potential clients - and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract.     3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)    4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.    5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.    6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area.     7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.    For more in-depth information about the business, we have compiled a list of books on the topic and you can either purchase the book or borrow them from your library. The list of recommended books on starting a cleaning business can be found at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/bookstore/ho...    - Commercial and Residential Cleaning Services: A Resource Guide to Developing and Maintaining Your Own Janitorial or Home Cleaning Business (Author: Walter Fenix)  - Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services   - The Janitorial Contractors Bible   - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business   - Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor   - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business|`|4374ad109e34da6a9668f1d5e7bee677aa	get a website or blog, and advertise to the whole world.

AA11452268	I found a few links to websites offering grants to Christian or non-profit institutions. The catch is that most of these groups give grants to churches and charities to spend on providing food and services to the community, not to spend on building their own churches. And of course, government grants are completely out of the question, as that is illegal.    You might try hitting up a Christian advocacy group for a small donation by claiming to be heading up a grassroots campaign for something they're interested in. Or maybe you can talk some megachurch into sponsoring or adopting you if you're in a disadvantaged area. For the most part, however, churchgoers will contribute money to make their own churches bigger but aren't interested in building churches for people who have already been converted to Christianity. Move your church to Pakistan and they might consider!    Best of luck.

Submit your site to major web site directories, especially DMOZ   3. join forums that are related to ur site, and Strategically mention your web site in message boards and newsgroups with a similar topic. search engines love to visit forums and message boards a lot.  4. consider writing free articles and mentioning ur site in the articles.  5. Exchange links with other webmasters, but only with sites that are related to yours (reciprocal linking)    I also think one of the cheapest ways to advertise is email marketing. Buy bulk emails, and send them out. Here's a good resource for email marketing http://qualitybase.org/emails.aspx|`|AA10144492	A few free resources  check out the sources box for links:    1) Create a blog pertaining to your field    2) Use Yahoo!

The key is make some money now than nothing.|`|ebfa7f264501dc2f3229554f9b049da1aa	If you do not intend on spending money you will not make money. If you have the product you can utilize it as the marketing "gimmick" and give enough of it away until you get product recognition. Marketing, commercials, ads etc will do this much more efficiently. You can also get companies to endorse the product by giving it them to try on their customers and then offer it as sales in the future. Trying to break into the market with no fund8ing for marketing is a daunting task.   Good Luck.

Differentiate yourself from a typical job seeker who is potentially sending their resumes to any and all companies and keeping their fingers crossed.  The follow up call will pique more interest in the recruiter as to the seriousness of your inquiry in their company, and the type of employee you will be.  Good luck!|`|ee50d0dc3ee684bc0e07c3b5725ef549aa	I think most companies through them out every 3 months.  Perhaps you need to take it somewhere for some tweaking.

Even if you don't become an agent, the knowledge that you acquire from the courses can help you with property investments and so forth.    Or, if you want to stay in the science field, take some specialized health science training (ie nuclear medicine, respiratory therapist, MRI technologist etc etc, usuallly 2.5yr programs).

Sicilia, il boom degli stipendi d'oro    Burocrate record 1553 euro al giorno   Megaretribuzione per un fedelissimo del governatore Cuffaro   al direttore dell'agenzia acque in busta pi di mezzo milione   di ATTILIO BOLZONI         Per agguantare stipendi da favola sono imbattibili. E anche in tempi duri come questi, di manovre finanziarie e di tasse e di tagli, quelli della Regione siciliana fanno sempre bingo. Sono riusciti persino a sfondare il record del mezzo milione di euro, ancora una volta a Palermo si sono mirabilmente superati. In cima alla lista degli uomini d'oro c' oggi un burocrate che ogni giorno di euro ne intasca 1553. A fine anno ne porter a casa 567 mila e 300, lordi e comprensivi di tutte le indennit.  un primato assoluto anche nella Sicilia dei suoi califfi.     Ci sono i conti che fanno acqua da tutte le parti, il deficit della Sanit  salito a quasi 1 miliardo e 300 mila, la Regione ha debiti che deve onorare a cambiali sino al 2022 o al 2027, intanto per spende e spande come nei suoi anni "felicissimi". Anzi, di pi. Molto di pi.     Fino all'ottobre del 2005 la pi pagata della burocrazia siciliana era Patrizia Bitetti, quella signora - in pensione dal dicembre scorso - che avrebbe dovuto far quadrare gli sgangherati bilanci di Asl e ospedali. Servizio delegato per un compenso di 480 mila euro. Nel 2006 la Bitetti  stata raggiunta e sorpassata da un fedelissimo del governatore Tot Cuffaro.     Si chiama Felice Crosta l'ultimo favorito dalla sorte, il numero uno dei super stipendiati di quella macchina mangia soldi che  la Regione. E' il direttore generale della neonata Agenzia per le acque e i rifiuti, 120 dipendenti di una struttura voluta e coccolata dal presidente in persona.     Crosta  vicino a Cuffaro da quando lui era assessore all'Agricoltura nel primo governo di centro sinistra a Palazzo d'Orleans: da quel momento i due non si sono mai pi separati. Il beneficiario della busta paga al top delle retribuzioni regionali  andato praticamente a sostituire per un incarico - dopo un interregno dello stesso governatore - quell'alto commissario all'"emergenza idrica" nominato dalla Presidenza del Consiglio a cavallo tra il 2000 e il 2001. Era l'ex comandante generale dell'Arma dei carabinieri Roberto Jucci.     Nonostante avesse cominciato a far arrivare pi acqua districandosi fra gli interessi e le competenze di 556 enti e consorzi, il generale  stato mandato via dopo quasi un anno. Jucci dormiva in prefettura e aveva accettato la nomina a costo zero.     Solo un rimborso spese. Ci aveva raccontato l'ex comandante, durante i suoi mesi a caccia d'acqua fra le Madonie e le terre **** dell'agrigentino: "Ho una certa et, mangio una volta al giorno e acquisto due vestiti l'anno, quando il governo mi ha chiesto di scendere in Sicilia mi  sembrato corretto non farmi pagare".     Da 0 a 567 mila e 300 euro per il direttore generale che sovrintende alle acque. E fino a 162 milioni di euro per tutti i dirigenti. Un esercito: alla Regione sono 2220. Nei giorni scorsi qualcuno, a Palermo, ha esaminato alcune tabelle e poi ha confrontato i numeri della Regione Lombardia e quelli della Regione Sicilia. La prima paga i suoi dirigenti poco pi di 19 milioni di euro, la seconda arriva appunto a 162. Quasi nove volte di pi. A Milano c' in Regione un dirigente ogni 60 dipendenti, a Palermo un dirigente ogni 6 dipendenti e un capoufficio ogni 2. Sono le performance dell'Anonima che spadroneggia alla Regione.     Gli stipendi dei dirigenti variano dai 50 mila euro fino ai 200 mila dei capoccia dei dipartimenti o di quelle che vengono chiamate "strutture temporanee", che per sopravvivono da anni e anni. I pi remunerati naturalmente sono i capi di quei 32 dipartimenti e di quegli uffici speciali "assimilati" ai dipartimenti. La sede di rappresentanza della Regione a Bruxelles, per esempio,  stata appena "elevata" al rango di dipartimento.     Dal 2003 al 2005 sono passate da 375 a 539 le "aree" o i "servizi" o le "unit operative" della Regione, un aumento del 43 per cento. Su ciascuna area o servizio o unit operativa  seduto un dirigente che percepisce un'indennit gallonata. I posti pi ambiti sono 600. Chi ce la fa a entrare in un ufficio di gabinetto ed  "in diretta collaborazione" con qualche assessore,  messo in condizione di guadagnare anche il doppio di un pari grado. Quei 600 baciati dalla fortuna costano circa 10 milioni di euro alle casse regionali.     Ma sopra tutto e tutti ci sono loro, i 9 nuovi uomini d'oro. Capi del Fondo sanitario. Capi della Programmazione. Il Capo della burocrazia di Palazzo d'Orleans. E sopra di loro quel Felice Crosta con i suoi 1553 euro al giorno. E' di queste settimane l'ultima "rivoluzione" nei palazzi della Regione. Nuove nomine, trasferimenti, rotazioni. Per alcuni  stata come una tombola.     Rafforzato l'asse fra l'Udc e Forza Italia e l'Mpa dell'autonomista catanese Raffaele Lombardo, il governatore Cuffaro e i suoi alleati hanno piazzato - ai margini della spartizione questa volta  rimasta solo Alleanza nazionale - tutti i loro uomini nei posti chiave dell'alta amministrazione. Ai Beni Culturali. All'Agricoltura. Alla Sanit. Promozioni di manager tutti "targati" ai vertici e sistemazioni pi laterali per gli altri: Corpo delle miniere; Istituto Vite e Vino; Istituto Olio e Olivo.     Ma non contenti di tanto scialo, avevano provato anche a ripescare una "leggina" votata dal parlamento regionale nel 2003. Una delle tante vergogne dell'Ars.

Non tanto per gli evasori - alcuni sono veri malandrini ma altri cercano semplicemente di sopravvivere - quanto per questa gena di nullafacenti e mangiapane a tradimento che  la cosiddetta classe politica.    Va male perch la classe suddetta  la pi pesante in Europa come numerosit e come remunerazioni.    Sono - tutti contando -, circa 600-700mila persone, che manteniamo !    Se fossero ridotte ad un terzo, e se per questo terzo residuo i costi fossero ridotti a livello accettabile, la democrazia funzionerebbe bene ugualmente ed avremmo un risparmio che da solo sistemerebbe buona parte dei problemi del Paese.    Anche perch costoro non fanno solo il danno della loro quantit e del loro spropositato costo unitario, ma ha da aggiungersi il danno inquantificabile, ma senz'altro enorme, del gran numero delle decisioni sbagliate che prendono e che sono sempre tutte costose e tutte a carico di pantalone cio il cittadino comune.    Ma come uscirne se loro hanno il potere e se lo autoalimentano ?    Non lo so. L'unica cosa che riesco ad intravedere come possibile (ma non so quanto efficace)  la protesta continua in tutti i luoghi possibili di discussione tipo questo.    Far sentire che ne abbiamo le tasche piene, far capire che voteremo chiunque - non importa il colore - s'impegni a far qualcosa per ridurre questa vera vergogna, questo furto legalizzato.  E anche se il furto  legalizzato - se lo autolegalizzano - non per questo  meno colpevole di chi evade le imposte.    E invece di far ci, o almeno iniziare a farlo, ci presentano una Finanziaria che chiede ancora altri soldi.    C'imboniscono che il mal andamento dello Stato dipende dall'evasione.    Senz'altro questo  un problema ma per ridurlo si cominci a portare le imposte a livelli civili e poi si batta sodo sugli evasori!    Ma l'inizio ha da essere nell'eliminare gli sprechi e gli sperperi:  e il primo - e il + vergognoso  poich di l dovrebbe arrivare il buon esempio -  quello del costo e del numero dei politici e loro accoliti.|`|8bd63a1a6c601aef6400678cc593bc1eaa	 quello che ci meritiamo.

Don't think that they know the basic functions of your job, explain it to them.  Try to remember what it was like when you first started.  What were your frustrations?  What did you wish people had shown you?      After covering the basis of how to do what you do, have your trainee do your job for you.  Of course you will be there with them to make sure to correct them before they can make any big mistakes. This way they can have you there all the time to answer questions while they learning by experiencing the tasks and remembering them through repetition.      Most importantly, make sure they know what resources they have available to help them make decisions and answer questions they might have.  For example, if a lot of information they'll need can be found on report X, make sure they know how to attain that report.

Your image will bring life and much needed personality to the page, and, the avatar image has a bit of depth in background, doesn't it? That peek of depth would enrichen the "topology" so to say of the page.  It's frightenly flat right now.  Put a really thin crisp black line around the image, again to add some definition.  2.  You have WAY too much info on the page.  Stuff like "Written by Administrator" and "Registered users get more access" is amateurish.  The Login and Polls sections don't go on your lead page. Click on to login on first page, but, login box of info goes somewhere else.  It's like having a washing machine in the livingroom.  Uncool.   3.  Alter fonts.  Break up the monotony.  When you get all done attractively designing the page with a composition of related fonts, look at the page, blur your eyes and notice the patterens and balance of the composition.  Adjust as necessary.   4.  Your colors.  Oranges are psychological triggers for gastronomical processes. I **** you not.  Select a cooler color, one that agrees with your avatar blues, perhaps, but one that triggers a feeling of intimacy, such as a large booth and sofa at a nightclub, something that will lure your visitors into feeling relaxed and a bit uninhibited, that there are possiblities for exotic cerebral experiences, not just the same ol same ol blog stuff.   5. The page doesn't "move".  It needs to be less blocked up, less symmetrical.  Try harmoniously asymmetrical constructions of the different components of the page.  Again, blur your eyes when you are done and see if your construction has any currents or fluidy paths for the eye to flow along with.   6. Make the eye flow across your page and end it up at your Login.  You want people to LOGIN more than you want them to look at your pretty first page.    7. Place a dark division of some kind between ad space and your space.  8.  You need to put "I Love To Argue" in large fancier font up high on the page inside of a page-wide rectangle that includes your image on the far left of the rectangle.

If people are not informed on subject matter they have no clue as to what to expect, nor what the site was created for.   Why not try something like "Do you like to argue ? Love to complain, rant and rave about current events ? (or whatever other topic(s) you may cover.)   The color scheme isn't too bad, however a little more may be added to make the site look more appealing. Perhaps even some graphics.   There are two links buttons under the main menu column while only one is needed. The placement of the buttons can be changed as well making it easier for members. I'd assume the arguing is done within the forums. That would probably the link which is most often used so perhaps move it to the top. The "contact us" should be at the bottom instead of second from top.   Most importantly let people know what goes on within the site. What it's all about, what you are arguing about, what they may expect. Don't keep it "quick and easy said" Take the time to explain fully what the site is there for, what people may do there and so on. If they like what they see or read then you should attract more members.|`|AA11247975	Keep it clean, neat and simple and at the same time  challenging.

Next, check on the credit report for unpaid bills...trust me they will be listed.  Beside those bills, look for name/address/phone number of creditor.  Call them up, and make arrangements to pay.    It is true that most creditors have written off your payment, but they will still take payment.  And, it should be reported to your credit history, that you paid these items in full.  Generally your un-paid creditors follow you on your report for 7-8 years.

You right now are looking at 2 years, MINIMUM to get it straight,but don't give up, plan accordingly. It is a hard lesson to learn but if you don't pay your bills, and take care of your credit... it is a hard road. TRUST ME, I have been correcting my credit for almost two years, but BOUGHT MY FIRST HOUSE!!! (not mobile home) two weeks ago!

Nonetheless, many companies specify certain degrees in their job ads and may also screen out candidates who don't meet those minimum requirements.  If the job ad says "degree in Marketing required" and your diploma says "Finance" you might get screened out even if you have five years of experience in Marketing.|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	There is nothing wrong with Marketing. With business degrees, you do get some leverage after experience to move around. A finance degree MIGHT get you stuck in a bean counting role, but you can still move about.    You will be relegated to business roles only. You can move between marketing, finance, possibly even HR. But unlike someone with an ENGINEERING degree -who can also transition to those other roles - they can also handle technical sales, R&D, product development, manufacturing and management roles as well.|`|274a49aa0deb547bee41561712d49d95aa	I think majoring in finance would be better. It is true that it doesn't matter THAT much for your first entry level job, but overall a degree in finance is much more versatile than marketing. You could use it for many things and it is a reputable degree.   Also as for experience, it is true that it goes along way, but since you are already in school and thinking of going with a degree in finance, I'd really go for it.   Good luck!!|`|619995b1caed24eab3758463a523876eaa	A college degree and certification always matter, but their importance declines as you gain experience.

After that it is what you do that get to noticed. It only matters if the job requires special skills. Marketing, accounting, operation research etc does call for specific skills. In general, marketing and sales is where the money is. The guy that brings home the bacon gets the bigger piece.    Another option, if money is available, have a special skills undergrad degree with an MBA. The special skill degree gets you in the door. The MBA separate you from the pack. You are at the right stage to make that decision now.
7b0f7af778ee24c2af6e903b0e616bc8aa	A psychiatrist is a physician specializing in diagnosis and treatment of brain injury and mental conditions. After a bachelor's degree, which is heavy into the sciences, you will have to apply and be accepted at a medical school. Then comes four years of medical school and up to five years in a psychiatry residency with maybe another year or two in a sub-specialty fellowship. To be on staff at any hospital or contract with most insurance companies, the psychiatrist must sit for rather comprehensive certification exams in both general and specialty areas. Psychiatry is among the worst paid specialties in medicine. Most physicians leave medical school with more than $100,000.00 in medical tuition loan debt. However, the demand is strong and a new graduate will find employment relatively easy.    After a bachelor's degree, and acceptance to a law school, comes three years of study.

You then begin saving extra money for short and long term goals.  Figure out what goals you are shooting for then allocate monthly savings towards each (Retirement, Children's Education, New House, etc.)      The time frame of the goal will make a big impact on the investment risk you are able to take.

5f9bd21c7ebad838417b0756f38ad6daaa	If it doesn't jeoperdize your career, I would say that you should stay in NYC because at least over there you have trains and you can walk, you already have an apartment and you are already adjusted. Los Angeles is way too spread out and it actually costs more to live in LA because you'll have to leave home atleast an hour and a half earlier than necessary if you want to get to work on time (2 hours to be safe) because the freeways are usually clogged and so are the city streets (there aren't many alternate roads that'll make your trip shorter). You would be buying gasoline more often because of the long times you spend on the road. You would either have to give up your free time or sleep because you won't have enough time to fit both in your schedule. You could probably get a place close to work (which I'm assuming is either in LA proper, Hollywood, Burbank, Glendale, Woodland Hills, LAX area, Santa Monica or Wilshire) and those areas are expensive and would just buy you 30 minutes of extra time a day. I made the mistake of moving from San Francisco (which is like NYC but slower) to Los Angeles and now, I'm back in SF. LA people are friendly but they generally don't have a lot of time to socialize. So I stay stick to NYC because it's cheaper and you already have a good life there. Then again, it's only for 6 months so, you should think about it. You might get more contacts in Los Angeles (which aren't that different from NYC contacts).|`|AA11440210	well, LA rentals are comparable to New york's, that is expensive, so you would be paying the same amount to rent for six months.    you would be taking a loss since they aren't offering  too much relocation.    it depends on what you want.  From your post, I am inferring, that you would relaly like to just stay in New York.  perhaps in a few months, there will be another opportunity.    is it really worth it at this point?    LA is crowded, overpopulated and spread out!!!|`|8f12ef22d8bb7336f03389c7f57552e9aa	If this is a good opportunity for you, then you should consider moving to LA temporarily. What you will fetch for your sublease will probably be more than what you will be paying for rent in LA. You should try to negotiate for more relocation assistance.
a06ce8bb5eaf998eb9d5618671a2037faa	There sure is.  Any 'financial calculator' can solve this problem in a jiffy.  Alternatively, excel can do it too using the FV function.  "FV" stands for future value.  I need to clarify that the calculations below assume that the $100 goes into the account at the end of every month (rather than the beginning).    Let's first assume approximate the answer by assuming that the interest is compounded monthly, rather than daily.  Future Value: FV = unknown  Present Value: PV = $0  Payment each period: PMT = -$100 (negative because this is money you are spending)  Rate per period: I = 5% / 12 periods each year = 0.4167%  Number of periods: N = 5 years * 12 periods per year = 60    Here is the syntax we will use with excel:  =FV(I, N, PMT, PV)    For the above example, we type in:  =FV(0.4167%, 60, -100, 0)    Our answer is $6800.68    So you saved $6000 over five years, and earned ~$800 interest.|`|AA10728326	Interest is rarely compounded daily.  I think that may be the problem that you are having.  This is a good calculator for you:    http://www.bankrate.com/brm/cgi-bin/savi...    $6800 btw.
5b8c6fce99914aaa939715f67a5ad573aa	$2973.18 (rounded up from .1792), assuming you mean one initial deposit and then it sits for 4 years.  The formula for that is $2400*(1+.055)^4    If you deposit $2400 EACH year for 4 years at that rate, you will have $10421.44 (rounded from .14393). For that one, the formula is more complicated, and I would suggest using a financial calculator (I don't know how to type the symbols for the formula).|`|AA10260180	$2,973.18

Here is some rading material.   http://www.expert-credit-advice.com/bank...|`|AA11715392	you can't file for it, must set up payment plan ?|`|AA11102769	The first two answers are incorrect    There are stricter guidelines for filing a Chapter 7 (complete discharge or elimination of unsecured debt), which will force more people into filing under Chapter 13 (repayment plan)  The changes in the guidelines include a new limit on the amount of income you receive, and also the amount of money you have left over once you pay necessary expenses each month.   Most working class people can still file under Chapter 7. If you are considering this, see a lawyer with a good rep who gives free consultations. He or she will be able to tell you if you are a good candidate for Chapter 7.|`|5bc502dd1d4ad09ec078fddc0258caf3aa	You pay 80% on the dollar.
7fe5d193e23fb97c93e8fa54111648d7aa	A Thank You card is the best in my opinion. I manage a work group of 44 employees where I do not expect a present  from anyone at anytime for anything. I work hard form them, going out-of-my-way at times but that's what a good boss does.  A simple "Thanks", "You're a good/great boss", etc... is good enough for me. And I hope none of my employees see me as someone who needs a present for any reason.|`|cede9d3f21e23c84df198c3deea42990aa	flowers, plants, gift cards to restaurants, movie tickets...  :o)|`|7f86f84ae8b51c36ea2ba260d97d638daa	A gift that is personalized is always a good way to impress a supervisor and stand out from the rest.|`|AA11100203	Traditionally gifts given to supervisors should be limited to things that are professional. For instance, things that can be used in the office e.g. mugs, calendars, a new picture frame.    Now, I've heard of people giving bottles of wine if they know their supervisor drinks, or something else that they have a hobby in like chess or fishing or football.    If you are comfortable with your supervisor outside of the work place give them a present that you would give one of your friends.    I'd stick to a card if none of these things seem appealing. Good luck!|`|92e1ff4ff0c58646b7f134351c8cab26aa	champaigne

I would suggest you call the particular store and ask a random associate their opinion of the management.  Having worked for THD in their corporate division, i can tell you that on the nationwide store-level, some people love it and some hate it, and alot has to do with the management of the store.    Whether it's a good place to work really depends on what kind of work environment you thrive in and what you will tolerate and what you won't.
AA11741556	You can be 16 to work at a "Separate Starbucks" as you put it. But you should come prepared with a work permit. I don't know where you live but I know here in California if you are under 18 you need a work permit.    You should also talk to the manager at a Starbucks because it could be different if you're in another state.|`|AA10591058	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks    Founded In 1971 across from Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington
f91057a2fa8c130e991f41ec0bfd6caeaa	When I was growing up, I could never figure out what I wanted to be. In High School, I didn't want to go to College because I had no idea what to Major in, so I didn't go.  I thought I wanted to be a Chef, and work in the "biz" for 20 some years, and finally through a series of events, became a Corrections Officer! See how that all dove tailed together?  haha.  Basically, our tastes change, our perspectives change, and we change. So stay tuned for an adventure!|`|AA10346776	I did temporarily. I wanted to be a cosmetologist and I was for several years.
