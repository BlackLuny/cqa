None of the other "calamities" that were supposed to devastate the environment ever happened. Why can't people realize that GW is just today's version?

20070112091522AAIhf8U	Environment	How can we make big corporate food service companies more environmentally responsible?	Chefs are always aware of the seasons as it brings a change in availability of produce. The availability of product and it's price flux makes us painfully aware of weather, political, and social changes.      The restaurant industry is seeing a shift towards more eco-friendly packaging for both raw products coming in the back door, and prepared items going out the front door.       Yet, while many chefs are taking on the challenge of finding organic foods, purchasing from local farms and supporting sustainable agriculture practices, the environment is still hurting.       Many large food service corporations, such as Sodexho, Compass, and Aramark who net billions of dollars annually, are not as strict in practicing eco-friendly habits as small scale restaurants are.       How can we make these large companies make environmentally responsible changes?

There are more than just volcanoes emmitting gasses- peat bogs, sulphur springs, decaying litter etc. Remember that the last warming cycle was when we were hunting small animals and eating them in caves.

20080804111533AAPmXRN	Environment;Green Living	Which is better for the environment?	Which has the least environmental impact, satellite, cable or some other form of broadcasting? I'm guessing that the old style antenna has the least impact but also the fewest channels. Next would be satellite because there's less resources used and it's easier to maintain than cable. Having worked for cable, I know they have hundreds of trucks on the road all day to maintain their network and to service customer’s problems. Satellite can be install once, serviced rarely and has less cabling to maintain. The most green choice is satellite?

20081016023839AAw9pXu	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	Hybrid cars, the best or the worst thing to happen to the environment?	Many people see only the cost at the pump and of course the hype surrounding hybrid cars, trucks, and SUV's.   I see more then that.      However if you are even considering any type of hybrid do real Research.  Not just on Yahoo Answers or asking friends and family.      Hybrids are built at a cost to the environment that their lower emissions will never make up for.  Not to mention with the high cost over a similar gas or diesel powered car you'd have to be a taxi driver to ever save any money (purchase vs. cost of fuel) on the car.   If there is ever a non-warranty battery problem you'd be looking into thousands of dollars to replace the batteries and the old ones would have to be scrapped at another extreme cost to the environment.      I honestly see cars such as the Prius as worse for the environment then a lower priced and similarly sized Corolla (also by Toyota) which will cost you more at the pumps.      If you feel differently then please, let me know why.
