q18xpBpPaa	you need to do your research 1st. PLEASE so many people buy them thinking they will be a cute fun pet. but they find out they require sooo much attention, alot of room(a whole one), they require a lifetime comitment. they can live over 40 years. they can snap any second and attack. for no apparent reason along with that they can become very nasty..also, it will be very hard to find a vet in your area that will help you out and the costs wil be very very high. also there is alot of black markets out there. dont get one from there they are the wrong place to get it. and monkeys get into every type of trouble possible. they get into everything. do your research. i wanted one. but after doing reseach as cute as they are i realize it would be bad. soo mmany monkey end up being given away to "monkey pounds"|`|psqkf6rMaa	the black market|`|q0vKbocHaa	a zoo....Monkeys are DANGEROUS!!! people have gotten killed by them, so before you buy one. please please please please research about it otheriwse you'll end up with a unhappy/ dangerous monkey, and a frusterated home...
edHUtupTaa	Yes, I have a rabbit and it is no trouble because we trained it to not go near all the wires and things but it shouldn't bite the skirting boards and if it does train it by holding it back or turning it the other way or you could even buy one of those wooden things for it to chew on instead they are really good and they DO work!!! any of those will work.    Also they are just really good pets in the first place I have had mine for 4 years and it is really good it doesn't even go to the toilet in the house anymore coz it knows not to now that I have trained it!|`|q18xpBpPaa	everyone here is correct! bunny proof the room as much as possible. here's my dorm bunny!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8my1TXBI...|`|RPTwjyjIaa	I let my pet rabbit (a Dutch) roam around my room. But not all the time, just when I can supervise him. I have tried to bunny proof my room as best I can. I know some people have house bunnies but it was a big job just to do my room I do not know about a whole house. Maybe just section off certain rooms that he can use all the time and then supervise him when he is in the other rooms. Of course my baby is litter box trained and when he is tired of hopping about my room he will go back into his cage all on his own. So cute he just plops down on his side like "well that was enough adventure for one day" :) Anyway have fun with your future house bunny.|`|winmjHAmaa	All I can say is, lol.      I wouldn't chance it.  If it chews a cord it will die.  Not a good situation  for you or the rabbit.|`|bmwTSnBfaa	To be honest.. i had 2 house rabbits.. no matter how i trained them.. they ate everything, including my sofa.  Carpets, walls, wires, curtains, skirtings.....  i know some people say u can train them not to chew.. but i have yet to meet anyone who has!|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	I have 2 house rabbits, you can litter train them but they will make a mess while you are training them.    They will chew the wires, we have had to cover everything with casing because on one occasion Jessica escaped while I was at work and she chewed right through the internet cable and my boyfriends headphones (and she also went to the toilet all over the couch and chewed up my boots!)    I would seriously suggest that you get a very large rabbit cage and keep your rabbit in it while you are out of the house, because you cant train them to behave while you are not there.  This is OK as long you let your bunny out whenever you are home.    Generally me and my boyfriend are at work from 7am. He gets home at 3pm and then my rabbits are allowed out until we go to bed, and at the weekends they are out all day.    Some people think this is cruel but this is no different to keeping a rabbit in a hutch outside in all weather (and preditors about) and to be honest I can let my rabbits out for AT LEAST 8 hours at a time where as you wouldn't let a bunny out for 8 hours in the garden everyday because as humans we wouldn't want to sit in the garden for 8 hours, I this is why house rabbits live longer, healthier and happier lives compared to the traditional outdoor rabbit.|`|iO4lpwiVaa	I have trained mine to not chew anything. The only time he did chew anything besides his toys was when he was really really little like 2 months and he nibbled buttons off the remote.  He chews on his toys and that's it.   & you can also litter train them so they don't make a mess  all over your house if your going to let the little guy roam.  Good luck!|`|QdfbKNKNaa	Don't listen to missmybella, you totally can get a house rabbit as long as you take some precautions.     Firstly, it's best to only let the rabbit roam around the house if it is supervised as they can end up chewing on wires and stuff. It's best to dedicate a room for it that is rabbit-proofed: block off access to wires, treated wood and other potentially hazardous things; make sure there isn't anything dangerous in the room such as a fireplace or heater. It's best to use a room that doesn't have expensive furnature and floors that are easy to clean.    I'm not 100% sure if you can completely train them to not chew on certain items; rabbits tend to be destructive animals and tend to chew on everything to keep their teeth healthy. They may have certain products you can buy to spray on what you don't want it to chew on that taste bad, also rabbits don't like the smell of vinegar. You should give them untreated wood and sticks to chew on and praise it or give it a treat whenever you see it using it.|`|k9CSH8Rmaa	i think you can but you need to get them young.i had a house rabbit once.she never chewed wires and she was toilet trained.just watch where you walk

AA12128656	the dog has separation anxiety (likely) excess energy (certainly) and boredom (definitely!)    i suggest that you crate him any time that you are unable to directly monitor him.    you need to give this dog a better outlet for his energy, he needs a job. you need to exercise him thoroughly, and tire him out good.    when i am training a dog (young or old, makes no difference) i keep them tied to me at ALL times. even when i'm cooking, doing laundry, etc.    you must give the dog a command and make him obey it to keep him from doing wrong things. for example, when you are putting your little one to bed, you need to train the dog a down-stay. then you can put him in a down stay in the doorway of your child's room, and this is where he must stay until you tell him otherwise.  the dog does not know what to do with himself, so he's making his own entertainment. do not allow him to do this. make every second of his life training (whether you're working or playing with him) and if you are not able to watch him for even a SECOND, crate him.  part of his play-training should be training him to chew on dog toys. reward him richly when he chews something appropriate. take him to a pet shop and help him choose his own toy. all dogs are different, and he may just not be really stimulated by the toys he has now.    train him like this, and you'll end up with a trained dog who knows how to behave appropriately.    the digging is generally caused by boredom and the fact that the dog is searching for moles or bugs. build him a sandbox and bury toys in it. dogs want to dig, and you can either train them out of it (harder, not fun) or train them where you WANT them to do it (easier, and fun!)  that's a decision you'll have to make.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	First off, 8 month old dogs are CHEWERS! Your dog is not at all abnormal.....it's your responsibility to watch the dog 100% of the time unless the dog is in the crate. A dog under a year old should never be left unsupervised. This isn't the dog's fault at all as it is still very much a puppy and puppies chew.  I'd increase the dog's amount of exercise and go from there.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Call your local kennel club and have them refer you to a reputable trainer in your area.  Your dog is probably  bored.  You need to do something with him, perhaps agility, or some dog sport.|`|ee70635f83473518cde2e7cf3b8004d4aa	Try putting mouse traps on your furniture.  We did this to stop our new puppy from jumping on the couch.  It works.  The first time one of those things snaps down on his nose, he'll never go near the furniture again.|`|pGacaRuFaa	He needs to be crated when he is unsupervised, and exercised hard when you are home. He is doing this out of boredom. Labs and pointers are working breeds and they need something to do so they don't go out of their minds. Get a backpack and weigh him down on walks so he wears out faster. You can also umbilical train him. Leash him up and keep him at your side at all times when you are home. You can tie the leash to your belt to free up your hands. Dogs always follow the pack leader, and it will reinforce your status in the pack. If all else fails, muzzle him when he is alone.|`|AA12083992	Does your dog get plenty of exercise? Do you reinforce his obedience training? Teach him tricks? He is no doubt bored and if you do those things it will help. Also for his safety and the safety of your home crate train.  three websites on how to crate train a puppy/dog    http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info...          Edit: This may help also:  Dogs chew, that's what they do. It is up to use to teach them what they can and cannot chew on. Some people make the mistake of giving their dog too many chew toys. This will cause the dog to think everything in reach is his/hers to chew on. When you are teaching them what is acceptable to chew on stick to one or two good chew toys. You will have to pay attention, be diligent. When the dog picks up the wrong thing simply tell him/her "No", make the dog drop it, then give the chew toy. When the dog picks up the chew toy, give lots of praise, let the dog know that was the right thing to do. You do that and soon your dog will go for the chew toy every time. That is the way I train my dogs.This is what ehow has to say about it:Step1Give your dog only a few toys. The toys should be varied in shapes and materials. If you give him too many toys to chew on, he may think that he has free reign on anything else in the house. Step2Let the dog play with these toys often. You can even buy toys designed to be filled with treats. The more the dog chews on the toys, the more likely she will chew on them instead of other items. Step3Use the crate training method. Dogs that are crate trained behave better and do not have access to your furniture or shoes when they are unattended. Step4Tell the dog "no" when you catch him chewing on a forbidden item. Give the dog one of his toys and pet him to let him know that the toy is alright to chew on. Step6Put a chewing spray on your forbidden items. Anti-chewing sprays containing bitter flavors can be placed on furniture, shoes and toys. Dogs do not like the taste, so they will avoid chewing on the items. http://www.ehow.com/how_2050282_stop-dog...    http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....       http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_c...|`|A9qDWpXUaa	You haven't said anything about his daily routine. Labs and Pointers are very Intelligent, energetic dogs and at 8 months old are entering the juvenile delinquent stage. They need all of the energy (both mental and physical) channeling and challenging in a constructive manor or what you have described will result.    As I don't know what he does do with his time I can't really comment but before doing anything make sure he is getting at least 2 to 2 1/2hrs "work" each day. This needs to be walking, obedience training, and some kind of exercises where he can use his natural find and fetch instinct by not just throwing balls but throwing them into long grass or some such and having search to bring them back.     A dog like this of this age needs guidence and training but also an outlet for his boundless energy and enthusiasm.    Note  Please don't get a back pack for this dog, he is only 8months old and his bones are not fully formed. Doing this could cause skeletal problems later in life.|`|c3nyypRmaa	Well I never have had a lab before but my friend has. I would say that you should give him a lot more exercise like about 4 or 3 walks a day play with him at 12:00 and 3:00 give him treats to eat if he is good. But I think if a dog is a chewy little guy I would give him two bones and make sure they arent real bones makes sure they say artificial flavors on it if it is a real bone chances are 60% he will choke. Make sure they arent to small because you're two year old will eat them and choke. I would also put a piece of old sofa part in the crate so he will chew on that. If you have a small room in your house that was the two year olds old bedroom make that the dogs bed room with his crate and his toys that were he will be when you are out just shut the door make sure there is a window in that room you can also use a walk in closet. I am very good with dogs I hope I helped you somewhat and whatever you do don't get rid of him if it starts to become so terrible than I would move to the country where he can just and play.
5Sr0HtFHaa	Watch for yourself.

Try watching birds mate sometime and you'll see, otherwise there wouldn't be any baby birds. Watch a nature show sometime.     As for fish, actually, some do have a penis. It's called a gonopodium and livebearers have this appendage. Livebeares give birth to live babies, the only way this can happen is if they mate like humans do. Other fish do what's called spawning. The female lays the eggs and male swims over them and releases fish sperm called milt. This fertilizes the eggs and they later hatch and become baby fish.    Asking this would be like asking how cats mate because male cats don't have a visible penis. But that doesn't mean they don't have one.|`|M9KUiTOAaa	The female usually sits low with her head and tail held high and she kind of flutters her tail. The male just sort of hops on top of her and flaps his wings while trying to hold on tight and tries to line up with her to make contact.

Os6VjLH0aa	Don't know that she IS a Plott, Lab mix, neither breed comes in brindle, (her coat pattern).  IF that's what she is she should end up being between 50 and 75 pounds or so.|`|AA12128656	na, plott hound is about same size as a lab. so.... lab size or so.    and that formula SO doesn't work. i have a pit mix male who is almost three times his weight at 14 weeks and still growing...|`|9kTejB0uaa	I have an excellent book called Hunting Dogs by F.Philip Rice and John I Dahl.  It states "Most of them are solid brindle in various shades of brown, brown and black, or greyish brown.  Some of them have a black saddle back with brindle, and others have solid black like the Black and Tan with brindle trim.  All of these colours are permissible."  It goes on to say "while the standard calls for dogs of no more than 60 pounds, and bitches of no less than 40 lbs  this breed runs a bit smaller on the average than the other treehound breeds"    So couple that with what your average Lab comes out at and you should have some idea about what your puppy will end up at.    Edit -while I was checking this, I see your add on  lol|`|TWW5DGttaa	SO CUTE! Look at a dog's paws. Their paws do not grow so when it looks like she has grown into her paws, she is probably about done growing.|`|RjyNInW6aa	Adorable. Probably 3 feet at he shoulders. Maybe smaller. 3 feet is pretty big.|`|PdotFx4naa	Do research on the two breeds and kind of figure out from there.  If the vet says that she will be smaller than anticipated then figure that in too.  There's no exact way in telling until she's full-grown.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	She sure is cute. I would think if you found out how much the average Lab weighs and same for the Plott hound you could add both weights together and divide by 2. It could give you a rough idea.|`|mMeylAJSaa	I don't really know but my puppy grew up to 4 feet.|`|yl0CZsy2aa	beautiful dog, nice fur.|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	what a cute pup. dogs normally grow till they're about 6 months they broaden out till they are about 8 months. of course sept the belly|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	You can't really go by the size at a certain age OR what the breed is supposed to do, because I have a full blooded chocolate lab. I was told he would be about 50 lbs. He turned out to be 115 lbs. and he's not fat. It matches his height! Just wait & see what happens. You'll love him anyhow. As for the paws, oh yes they DO grow.|`|mnufOa6eaa	Without seeing an adult of the Plott Hound, if that is her other breed as someone else said, there's really no way of telling. If you know the size of the two breeds, you can make a decent guess off that. Or if you have another full grown dog to compare to when you get them you can guess a little more.     I have an Australian and a German Shepherd mix. When I adopted the Shepherd mix he was 9 weeks old. At 9 weeks he was almost the same size as my full grown Aussie, she's 40 pounds. Based off that I knew he was going to be big. And he is, he's 100 pounds.    Based off the additional informatin you gave, I'd say medium to large. Labs can be big depending on the lines and breeding prior to the new generation. It says in the description that Plott's are basically medium dogs. So you can probably safely guess medium to large.|`|lhQGN8Ucaa	i have been told multiply weight by 3 at 3 months old. That has been pretty accurate with my dogs. though my dogs are smaller breed dogs. By the way  she's cute!|`|jUenNEHsaa	Well I can't really promise that she'll be a big dog! After all most labs are rather big (my dad has a huskey lab mix) and Bear weighs roughly around 80 lbs.     It also depends on if she was the runt of the litter. Being a shelter dog you can't know for sure. But shelter dogs are smaller then the normal size.     For height wise at this time it's best to look at her paws. Big paws mean big dogs (my rottie is huge....and she had bit feet as a puppy)    Generally though, Labs run around 55-70 lbs for weight and 21-24 inches for females. I'm not sure about the other breed (never heard of a Plott hound!)  I'm going to guess maybe add a bit more on both for your pup.    She's a cutie by the way!
y7H1V39Jaa	Yes, they will, but when you see that, its time to haul water.  They don't eat the snow unless they really need water and they can't eat enough of it for what they need.  They need water hauled to them, every day so that they can at least get their fill of warmed water once a day at the minimum.*|`|IMPvzBk1aa	They will eat the snow, but it doesn't supply much hydration.  Horses have survived in those conditions by eating snow to get some water in, but the body demands a large amount of water to sustain cell metabolism, and digestion.  Do the best you can to get there and hope for the best in the meantime.|`|AA10986942	It takes 6 inches of snow to make only 1 inch of water. To answer your question yes your horses will eat snow but no they cannot eat enough to satisfy their thirst or water needs for their gut to work properly.  I am sorry for you, I understand that you are trying your best to get them feed and water and that is all you can do.  They will be hungry but will make it a couple of days but not much longer.  Hope you get to them soon.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	They can eat snow even tho its really not the best situation.  It takes more energy to melt it in their mouths.  A rancher neighbor of mine back in SD did that with his herd of arabians and they all survived amazingly, but they definately do not get enough water doing it that way and colic/impaction is a huge concern.    Is there anyone by them that can water them for you?  The reality is, that even tho you put out extra hay, its probably gone by now.  Either with the snow covering it or they gobbled it up.  Horses do not ration their feeding.    This is why you always need backup plans, in all situations.  I have blizzard backup plans living in Wy, and you need to check with neighbors etc, to see if they can water and feed for you.  I guarentee that after 2 days, your horses have no hay left.|`|Q1U8hP1Xaa	They will,but it's really not a good source of water. Even if they do eat it,they could get dehydrated...it's really hard for them to digest their hay/feed if they're just eating snow.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	They will eat snow for water, but it isn't very efficient.    Here's an article on winter dehydration    http://www.myequinenetwork.com/LinkClick...    Another article states    "...Horses will drink eight to 12 gallons a day. Forcing a horse to produce moisture by eating snow is counterproductive.     "Six times as much snow must be eaten to provide an equal amount of water. Furthermore, calories are used to melt the snow that   should be used for body warmth."|`|FAwqctmNaa	they will eat the snow but its not alwasy a good idea to give them just snow for water intake cause it doesnt give them all of what they need

ANYWAY, it does tend to make quite a mess of the bathroom and the person doing the bathing.  This can be minimized if you fill the bathtub only a few inches with water and start off with some good sized plastic containers for rinsing.  Plan on using at least two large towels for this process--one for the floor/walls and the other for the dog.  Clean it all up and then plan to take a shower yourself, as long as you're in the bathroom!    Really though, this breed requires almost no bathing, so at least you don't need to do this chore very often.|`|WiycCxpzaa	Hahaha, bathing a dog without getting wet, that's funny.    Sorry, it's not possibly to give a large dog a bath without getting wet. They splash, they shake, you get hair all over you.

Lucky me. ;)|`|ZWf7O5HDaa	Put on your bathing suit and hop in the shower with your dog. You both get wet but it is not as difficult (no lifting the dog over the bathtub). Plus it makes clean up time a lot easier. Hope this helps.|`|f7S8dcmpaa	There are dry powders you can use.  Sprinkle on the dog and brush.

Os6VjLH0aa	Shaking is usually a sign of pain. Sounds like she might have wrenched her back, or she could have an intestinal blockage. Has she, pardon the bluntness, been pooping normally? Or is she straining with no results?  If that is the case it's probably a blockage.  Try to be calm, get her to the vet, the simplest answer is usually the right one. Hopefully she just did some soft tissue damage playing too hard or something.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	She may have hurt her back, or she could have an intestinal upset.    Lots of things it could be, good thing she's going to the vet.|`|GT6396BDaa	She may have strained or hurt her back.  This is common in small breeds of dogs.  Or she may have arthritis, which the vet can give her meds to help give her some pain relief.  The vet may want to run some x-rays and do bloodwork to check her levels, to be on the safe side.  Just try to make her comfortable until she can see the vet.  Best of luck to to your dog.

XRxLZYFwaa	You don't have a problem. You are very lucky to have such an obedient dog. Just take a look around in the pet section at how many people complain about dogs that "do it" in the house. It's only annoying while it's winter, so suck it up and wait for spring!|`|hEQz0v40aa	She has had a set back due to the weather. the extreme cold; snow is wet sticky, her yard is different. like some of the others have noted, you can always try a new approach with going with her. with or without  leash on and go with her. But then come spring a new habit has been formed and you will have to attend to her each time.   I suggest a small  temporary fenced in area for now and then come spring she will be accustomed, of course you sill still have to take her, place her in pen and then retreive her.  also use of the training pads might help to relocate a spot. Save up her deposits and  place in another area.|`|PdotFx4naa	I guess just keep working with her on it.  She's just cold, she wants to come back into a warm home.  My dogs do the same thing!  Have boots and a jacket handy when you let the dogs out until it warms up.|`|s76aC4G8aa	It's called a leash, leash her up and take her out to the place you want her to go then let her come back inside.  If you don't like the behavior then you need to take her out yourself to where you want her to go.    Obviously this will resolve itself come springtime but in the meantime use a leash.|`|yCSvK6Uwaa	consider yourself lucky!!!

I've read this e-book it teaches you about dog behaviors and how to respond accordingly.    Apart from that you will learn powerful techniques to solve ANY dog behavior problem such as failsafe methods for dog house training (toilet training),professional secrets to training an aggressive dog no matter what the circumstances.    If you really truly want a healthy well trained dog who will LISTEN to you wherever you go... if you want to be respected by other dog owners as someone who takes great care of their dog... then there is no doubt in my mind this will work for you.

Have you thought of these things:    1.  Who will take care of my new puppy while I am at school all day long?    2.  If I am at school all day, who will teach my new puppy to potty outside and not inside of the house?   3.  New puppies require several small meals & lots of exercise, who is going to take care of this while I am at school all day long?  4.  What if my new puppy becomes sick or is injured (1 vet bill could cost you $1000.00 or more) how will you pay for your new puppy's medical bills?  5.  Have you researched the breed to see if it is compatible with you and your family's lifestyle?     These are just a few things to consider before making the decision to bring a new pet into your home.  Far too many pets end up in shelters, left at the veterinarians office or worse, dumped on the side of the road to fend for themselves because of the reasons above.

4sDaBXAjaa	The rice bran will definitely work. I had a thoroughbred that was having trouble gaining weight, and it worked beautifully. Corn oil is another alternative, but you shouldn't use them together. You may also want to up the protein in the grain you are giving him. Make sure you try one thing at a time, you don't want to change too much too fast, and cause him to colic. Good Luck!!|`|Fb5YtlkEaa	I would NOT put him on rice. First thing I would do is switch his feed to a 10%  MAX. protein. PELLET(i am assuming he is a thoroughbred and NOT racing). Do not give this horse sweet feed. I would consider southern states brand feed or Neutra Safe Choice. I would say 6-8 lbs MAX for these brands of feed a day (they are powerful concentrates and do not follow the 1 lbs per 100 lbs rule.)     Next add beat pulp. Cheap and large soak at least 12 hours before feeding and add to feed.     His pasture is fine but what hay are you feeding him at feed? Cut out alfalfa and other rich hays. You want a calorie rich but not protien rich hay. Local hays are best and tend to be cheap without giving him to much energy.    If the grain alone doesn't help the coat (southern states usually does without adding anything) a shot of flax seed or red cell is a good choice. Flax is cheaper and will not ad energy. If he is working 3+ days a week for more than an hour of work (not walking or trotting but real work) then red cell is a better option. More expensive but it promotes coat, hoof, eye, muscle and tendon health. Some horses may get more energy from this because they feel better.    Do NOT use shampoos or conditions on his coat. Just your water for a few months and a scrubby pad. let his body restore the oils. Only use soap when he is stained or on white marks or if going to show. Let him roll in the dirt (if he doesn't need to look pretty for show) it removes dead skin and encourages a shiny coat.    Remember no more than 50% of his total caloric intake should be from grain. It is better 30% caloric intake from grain and 70% from forage and hay. This promotes his digestive health which effects the rest of him.|`|q18xpBpPaa	lots of high protein food and you will get that result. whether it human or horse :)|`|sW8VQy4Qaa	Give him more hay! Thats always the answer i've tried all the grain and it just doesn't work and it does make there coat shinier
mnufOa6eaa	I'm sure it would, afterall, swordtails and platies and mollies can interbreed. But breeding egg layers, what gourami's are, is difficult. Person who said these fish couldn't spawn together, did you not see what I said? If platies, swordtails, and mollies can interbreed and they are 3 different species of fish, and they can, I'm pretty sure 2 different kinds of gourami's can spawn.     These fish are just like bettas when it comes to breeding, you DO NOT put more than one female in the breeding tank. One male, one female, that's it. And yes, I've bred bettas before.     If you want to try to breed, you'll have to condition them so they stand the best chance of coming out of it healthy. You can condition them with live food if you can get it, blood worms, brine shrimp, there are a few other kinds but I'd have to go to my betta board to tell you the names. If you can't get live you can buy the frozen kind at PetSmart or Petco or just about any petstore that sells fish should have frozen fish food. Seperate them as being together has probably made them so used to each other they are less likely to spawn, but I'm not positive since again, mine was an accident, though doing so would probably be best. Condition them on a varied diet of their normal food and the live or frozen food for 2 weeks. If you don't have a seperate tank you'll need to buy one so the fry stand the best chance of survival.     Fill the tank half way full. Turn the heat up a little, For betta's I belive it's about 78 or so(I don't remember off the top of my head, I'll have to look when I go home), or a little warmer, as this makes them a little more eager to breed for some reason. Since my breeding was an accident I don't know how this part would be best, but for bettas you introduce the male first then the female in something he can see her in. If you can buy a divider that would probably work just fine as well. Put the male in one side, the female in the other and when the male starts to build his bubble nest(a nest of bubbles at the top of the water) take out the divider and hope they will spawn. Once the female releases her eggs the male will fertilize them and gather them up and put them in the nest. This is why the tank can't be more than half full, he'll get very tired if he has to swim the whole distance up and down to gather the eggs and put them in the nest.     After spawning, remove the female. I believe Gouramis are like bettas in that they take care of their eggs and protect them so you can leave the male in with the nest of eggs until they hatch, then remove him so he's not tempted to eat the fry. If you aren't comfortable leaving him with the nest, you can remove him. I hatched mine just fine by removing them from the community tank and putting them in another tank.     Once they hatch, after 24 to 48 hours, it would be best if you can buy brine shrimp eggs and a hatchery so you can feed them live food, though I successfully raised mine on powdered fry food, live is better for them. Once they're big enough you can start feeding them the live or frozen food you were feeding the adults to condition them. The most important part is to cover the tank since Grouami's are air breathers and have to develope their labyrinth organ, the organ that allows them to breath air. The air above the water has to be moist and warm so this organ develops properly. Leave the tank half full for a while, maybe till 5 weeks, then graudally start to fill it. You don't want to put a filter in there too soon, but if you can buy a sponge filter you can use that as it's more gentle than a normal filter and put that in then turn it on when the tank is full enough to cover the spout of it.     You'll want to do small water changes/cleanings, 2 to 3 weekly if you have time, otherwise at least 2 after at least the first week of their lives. If you can wait until they're almost 3 weeks, that would be even better, but you can do it before. The more often you change the water, the faster they should grow.|`|VFx4YHFEaa	I have a male gold spotted gourami from pets at home to! my one is 6 inches and is very peaceful!

The ones that shops are selling as spotted gouramis are the blue or 3 spot.  If it is the kind that you have got the I dont think they are a breeding pair because they both would have to be the same colour.    But there is another strain of pearl gourami which is completely golden in colour and it might be possible that they will interbreed.    .|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I'm not sure what species you mean by a "spotted gourami," but if you mean Malpulutta kretseri, which is often called by that name, I very much doubt that they could hybridize and produce viable offspring. These two fishes are not "variants" of the same species, they are different species and are not in the same genus nor even the same subfamily within the gourami superfamily.    If they do crossbreed, though, please report it here. It will be very interesting to see what you get from this cross.|`|KTj3z0loaa	Yes! They are the same species but just with different colours.

Keep using a verbal signal ("go potty" usually works) and repeat it until she goes.  No playing or anything until she goes potty.  Then reward her and let her play.    She needs to not only be taught where NOT to go, but where TO go, and in order to do that, you need to be there to encourage, witness and reward.|`|9kTejB0uaa	How typical!  And frustrating.  But it sounds as if you have the timing all wrong here.  Regular ain't necessarily what's needed here.  She needs to go out, even at this age, immediately after she's eaten, ditto after she wakes up, ditto after she's been playing and times in between.  At least for now, until she gets the idea.  And I'm afraid you do need to go with her, (back to the loads of praise and in immediately after she goes) and she does need to have a special place (again for now).  I assume this doing it after she comes back in only started once you let her 'free range'?  So it's back to basics.  You could try crating her immediately after she comes back in so she gets out of this habit.    The crate will help with her nightime activity too.  Once she in her crate for the night, that's IT.  No up and whining, just quiet and crate.    Hope this helps.    ps  I really do think you have to have a fenced area for her, when she's unsupervised - it's all very well being in the country, but you'd be horrified at all the farm dogs that go missing (UK - Doglost.co.uk)   We've had acreage in the past, and always fenced off an area for our hounds.

It doesn't matter who is "alpha" in the relationship between your dogs (dogs will often give and take much more than people seem to realize) what does matter is that you are in control of them and their behaviours.    If the play gets out of hand stop it and if necessary part them until things cool down, if one dog keeps going for more when you have said stop the that is the one to address (I would prefer not to punish but redirect to another incompatible behaviour under my control and wouldn't allow play which results in this to occur in the first place).    Why she is biting at him when they see other dogs on a walk doesn;'t really matter either, the fact that she is does! Stop her! Teach her to behave in a more appropriate manor, train her.     I enjoy watching the Dog Whisperer too, I didn't to start with but he has obviously done some work around behavioural science, how dogs learn etc and it is now starting to filter into his shows.

If these parasites are not treated they will keep reproducing and your pups will get sicker! My puppy was placed on Albon and Panacur and after about a week her stools are finally firming up! When she was diagnosed her stools were watery, light in color, and sometimes green or with red drops in it that looked like blood. I have heard that a lot of pups get very lethargic and may even start throwing up. Luckily we treated her before hers got so bad!

I have met some of the most loving, friendly and wonderful Pit Bulls. They need to be given a chance. The negative label that has been placed on this breed is truly unfair. It is all in the way they have been raised. It's a  shame that some people can't get past a stereotype, and learn to have an opinion from personal experience.     There is not one breed I can think of that doesn't have a few that are just unfriendly or viscous. It's a shame that some dogs, just like some people are judged unfairly.

Anyway, it has a happy ending and I hope he and the old gals that found him live long and happy lives.|`|LofOjmeMaa	sad retard. i just wasted a minute of my life i can never get back .i dont allow plug ins so i didnt watch the spam video probably a virus. cujo dies of rabies in the end. if that dog was found wandering streets of UK it would be dead now as pitballs and pit bull cross bred mutt variants have been banned here since 1991.if a vet established that he was one its bye bye cujo hello heaven. ta for the two points .
LxM7LhAEaa	Adopting a pet is a huge responsibility, so I think that rescues requiring certain things from potential pet owners is a very good practice.  Requiring proof of veterinary records for current pets, vet references, status updates, and the like are things I support.      When a rescue requires multiple documents and references, I start to wonder.  For instance, if I have a reference from my vet, how necessary is it to have a personal reference, too?  And if I have a vet and a personal reference, how necessary is it to have a home visit on top of that?  Many shelters and rescues that I know of are understaffed and over-worked.  I just wonder about how they make the judgment call about how much information do we need to know about this person before we will let them have one of our pets.      There are times when I feel like the adoption policies of some rescues are a bit excessive, but then I remind myself that the reason such measures are in place is probably because of some terrible instance of abuse/neglect in the past.    Good luck on your plans to start your own rescue, and good for you!|`|JiCKFTuIaa	There is a reasonable level of conditions and then there is playing God. One is good the other is not.   A simple little thing that I have learned is that there are an abundance of places to get a dog. So if I don't like the conditions that are being set, I can always go elsewhere.  There is a good chance that you or anyone else will not be asked to come snoop around in my home. I just don't let people I don't know do that.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Rescue contracts are very invasive. NSAL's contract does not allow you to tie, leash, or tether the dog to anything for any length of time (if they catch the dog tied, leashed, or tethered to anything they will take the dog away, even if you've had the dog for years). They reserve the right to send an inspector to your house w/o any notice. The inspector may film, photograph, and tape the dog in your house. If the inspector doesn't like the way you arranged your flowers on the other side of the room, they can take the dog away, under their sole judgment, even if you've had the dog for 10 years. They reserve the right to break into your house to confiscate the dog, and you waive all damage claims, even if you've had the dog for 10 years.    I read this contract and walked out (I'd been approved to adopt the dog). I was kind of sad: the dog I was trying to adopt was a sweetie and was being totally ignored by everyone.    Also, I'm not so sure that these shelters work solely in the best interests of the dog. They turn away people who are obviously going to treat the dog well because of some minority or because the contract is too invasive. I have so many stories of shelters turning away people because of stupidities.    Also, shelters don't seem to be very careful where the dogs go... I know two dogs (owned by different owners and from different rescues) who had no business going to a city.|`|mnufOa6eaa	I feel that most of the provisions are acceptable, even good breeders will require you to return the dog or cat to them if you can't keep it for any reason. For the vet references and home visits. If they check with your vet they can make sure you didn't just put down an animal because it got too big or you didn't want it anymore or that you didn't just get rid of an animal for no reason. This shows them you're responsible and won't just get rid of the dog or cat because it's no longer convenient for you to have it. Home visits will show them if the dog or cat will be safe in your home. After all, if you walked into a house that had boxes all over the place, piles of clothes and other such stuff all over the floor and was filthy that you'd want to adopt a dog or cat into that situation?     For the food, that is just way to strict. Some foods are very expensive so requiring someone to feed their new pet a food they possibly can't afford is ridiculous. I can see the rescue wanting updates on the pet you adopted, but not requiring it.|`|WLNX00c3aa	when we adopted our dog through Smiley Dog Rescue, their policies were very reasonable.    put an application in for the dog you are interested in.    visit the dog you want at one of their pet adoption events. this is to put your name on a list to make sure that you are serious about the dog you are putting in for.    if you are chosen, there is a person who will come for a home visit to make sure the fence and home are up to code so that the dog is safe.    then when they approve you, you make arrangements to pick up the pup from the foster home.    And if you can not keep your pet, they are the first person whom you should call.    i think their policies help both the owner and the puppy/dog in the long run.  i like how they are very through before giving the dogs to anyone.    EDIT:   K Z, the fence check is to make sure you have an adequate fence height so that the dog/puppy doesn't jump over the fence OR have loose boards where the dog/puppy can move to roam free.|`|yCSvK6Uwaa	I think that those rules are very important it keeps track of the animals your customers have adopted and makes sure that they are taken care of the way they deserve to be..that's so awesome that your starting a rescue  facility!!! I've always wanted to do something like that but I'm 16 so it's sort of out of my reach but maybe someday?  but one thing I really hate about some animal shelters is that they charge you to bring in animals and I know that you guys have to make a profit somewhere to keep it going but once my mom and I found a pitbull wandering the streets of Indy and I love dogs no matter what the breed! My mom said it was most likely a cold blooded killer but I saw a lonely animal! so I called to him sounds crazy right but I just thought that if he was going to kill me he would be running at me and foaming @ the mouth plus I was in the car and calling out the window so I felt like I was covered...and he was the sweetest thing!! belly up and tail wagging baby! so we took him to the shelter and it was 150 bucks to bring him in!! I was so upset...my mom said there was no way she could pay to give away a dog that wasn't ours so the shelter turned us away! I was so hurt and confused why would they do that?!! this dog needed help! a chance to find a home! Mom said that "there way no way on earth" we could have a pitbull with our other dog so we were forced to set him free on the streets and I never saw him again I like to think he found a home but people don't act kindly to pitbulls and I wish they would be judged for the dog inside not the monsters some people turn them into..I'd like to see that rule changed or at least make the price to "surrender"a dog cheaper thanks for all you do and will do =]|`|BmI2fszPaa	I think all these policies are wrong. I had a fostering go wrong when the cat turned out to be seriously ill and I had to give it back. The backlash from the rescue worker was scary. They knew my address, my home phone , my cell , where I worked, etc. And I was threatened "we know where you live".  I will never deal with a rescue again, I will only adopt from the spca (which I have several times).  I admire & respect people that rescue animals, however when an animal is placed for adoption it should not come with strings like this. My cats are my best friends, but Im never going to jeopardize my families safety again in this way. Why do rescues think they are somehow morally superior to any other decent animal lover that they would make them jump through all these hoops to adopt?|`|RT8LZy7gaa	The group I volunteered for required a home visit, a call to the vet about current or previous pets (and the circumstances of their deaths), an application (which led to the home visit and vet check). There were also adoption fees.  Before they began spaying/neutering everything before it being adopted, it was required that proof of the procedure be given by the time the animal was 6 months old.    Though I felt some of their policies were rather strict at times (indoor cats only when the potential adopter obviously would never go to bed unless their indoor/outdoor kitty was safe in bed at night).      Some of the policies scared away adopters, others never questioned and passed with flying colors.  There were other volunteers that did the checks so the person applying didnt blame the foster for being denied a pet.    They were required to return the pet to the group if they couldn't keep it, and several animals came back even years later, but they always found homes again.    So the catch 22 is, if I couldn't keep my dog, which I was fostering and ended up adopting, because of my coming down with a major illness or something, and I knew how to find him a new home that (knowing his personality) I knew he would fit in, would I be in violation and what would be the consequences? I don't think anyone ever followed up on that end of it. At least I never heard of my group taking someone to court over that voilation.    Some potential adopters just think they see a dog or a cat at a show and it will be going home with them that day.  Children cry, adults get mad that you don't "trust" them.  It's amazing how some people react.    But now that there are more rescues out there, people know more what to expect I think. More people seek out rescues and shelters when looking for a pet.|`|7KusBcSxaa	I work with several rescues.   I like the 'policy' that states that, for cause, the dog can be reclaimed by the rescue group. Never had to use it though.  I also like the 'requirement' that adopters 'report' annually (they don't, but those who do really send heart-warming messages and photos, and that's why I like it).   We do require that a dog be returned to the group if the adopter can no longer keep it. This prevents it ending up in a high-kill situation without our knowledge.  We also microchip all dogs, and then ask that our group be kept on as the "last line" on the list of back-up contacts with the chip company. DoG forbid.... This has saved THREE of our dogs, to my certain knowledge.   We ask for Vet references, and we do check them to make sure the dogs the applicant has are getting basic care. Beyond that, we don't invade.  Our home visits are more educational times - our breed is odd, to say the least, and people need to understand its unique needs before they "say I do". We discuss feeding, grooming, safety, etc. We do walk the house and yard with the applicant's new-found information and check for safety concerns, which they are asked to fix before the dog comes home.  We don't see this as a time to reject an applicant - that should have been done on conversations and reference checks.   We discuss nutrition, along with other topics. We do not dictate how or what adopters feed. Frankly, if someone told ME what I had to use, they'd best be paying for it.    On Edit: If you had that serious a situation and you had some responsible person who wanted your dog, I would still expect you to contact our group. Chances are, we'd talk to them to make sure they had a good understanding of the breed (or help them get it) and then say 'ok'.  It's all about the dog and its happiness and health. To be a bit rough about it: these dogs have had their time in Hell. It's up to the rescue group to make sure they don't ever have to go back into that type of situation again.   Honestly, I DID have the health thing happen. I contacted my regional volunteer, and before I knew it, every one of my dogs, personal and foster alike, had a solid loving place to go if the horrible happened. You just cannot put a value on that.|`|024lJBZ4aa	I have no problem with the following adoption policies:  Vet refrences  personal reference  home visit  proof of vet records of current animals  returning the dog if you can no longer keep it.    These are all for the benefit of the dog.  They want their dogs going into forever homes and not getting bounced round.      I do have a problem with telling someone what kind of food to feed or regular updates.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Well, we tried to adopt an Italian Greyhound and they told us that the waiting list was about 5 years, in which time they would have home visits at any random time, I had to provide a credit check, my vet had to give a recommendation and I had to offer 5 personal references... We also had to provide a list of all animals and allow our vet to go into details about their problems/visits, etc... We were turned down because my husband had a golden retriever that had bladder surgery for bladder stones... the thing is, he was 12 years old at the time and we were doing what we should have been doing for him, taking care of him and providing love... We can't help it if he gets something like that.     Its like with me... am I a bad human being because I had to have my gallbladder removed?! No... So, how does an illness like that be counted against me when we did everything we could. He had the surgery and came home fine. The rescue said we didn't deserve an IG if we couldn't care for out current pets... my jaw dropped because we did everything we could and he came home and we got to love on him for about another year until he died.... at almost 14....     I just don't get it.    So, we found a breeder of Rat Terriers, since they are similar in size and personality and bought one since they aren't as fragile. We have two small children and wanted a dog they could also play with. And you know what? I couldn't be happier and Ginger, is the best dog I've ever had, aside from Trigger - the goldren retriever. :-)|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Any potential adopter that balks about having to provide a vet reference and such raises a huge red flag for me. If someone is going to provide a good home for a dog, those are all requirements that are easily met.   Most dogs in rescues come from questionable backgrounds and if they are just placed back in a less than desirable home, then the dog wasn't really rescued. Rescue workers are doing the work for the love of the animal not to give people a 'free' or 'easy adoption process.'   The best interest of the animal should always come first and these policies are in place for just that reason. If potential adopters have a problem with that, then they are obviously not a good candidate.    That's not to say that some rescues don't get carried away.....but for the most part, I think rescues have very sound policies that help find the best home for the animal.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I am all in favor of THOROUGHLY screening applicants.  You want to make sure, as much as possible, that the dog is going to a good, permanent home.    However, many rescues stick to the letter of their requirements, rather than looking at individual cases.  For example, many rescues will not adopt to someone who has unneutered animals, or their pets don't get annual vaccinations, whatever the reason, whereas a good pet owner may have perfectly valid reasons for any of these things.  Same with having an unfenced yard or living in an apartment.  If the owner is dedicated, neither of these is a problem.  I think the rescues should investigate these cases more closely, to determine if the owner is really responsible or not, rather than automatically dismiss them.    I also think that requiring a certain food is a little excessive.|`|W0buucLsaa	The only thing that strikes me as extremely onerous is the dog food thing - that's RIDICULOUS. It's like telling someone they are not fit to adopt kids because they eat iceberg lettuce and not arugula.    The fence thing is iffy. You don't have to have a fence to take good care of a dog.     The "regular updates" thing could be pushing it depending on the situation. Like, if it's been four years, I don't really want to talk to these people anymore. Maybe once we have GPS chips inside dogs, things will get better in that regard (yeah, that's coming in the next 10 years, I'm sure of it).    Otherwise, I think these are all good. A lot of them are in place so that only people who REALLY WANT the dog will bother to deal with all the bullcrap.     As far as what happened to Beatngu with the Italian Greyhound, I imagine the 5 year waiting list had a lot to do with that negative experience. It's a supply/demand thing - they are actually looking for reasons to reject people because supply is low and demand is high. For a rescue. Of a fairly uncommon purebred dog.|`|AA10229248	As someone who's been in rescue for over 5 years and requires most of the things you mentioned, I can see a valid reason for all of them.    Vet references let us know whether the current pets are cared for. If I rescue and foster a dog and have it treated for heartworms, I really don't want to adopt it to somebody who doesn't have their current pet on heartworm preventative. Kind of defeats the purpose of treating the dog if it's going to run the risk of having it happen again.    Personal references. I've never had somebody say "Oh don't give them a dog!" It's more of a safety net. For one thing, if the dog ends up picked up as a stray and returned to the rescue via its microchip, we can track down the adopter through references if they are no longer at the address/phone on their application. I have had many potential adopters not be able to give three personal references. If you can't come up with three people to speak for you, you're in pretty bad shape.    I do ask what brand of food the adopter will be feeding. This is more of an educational tool. For myself and the adopter. If somebody is feeding Ol' Roy, they may need some educating on dog nutrition. Also, there have been brands of dog food I'm not familiar with until an adopter mentions it. So I learn something. I also have had some dogs that were on special diets and I want to be sure the adopter continues that.    I absolutely want the dog returned to me if the adopter can't keep it. If I foster a dog for 6 months and then adopt it out, I'm still attached and want to keep up with the dog. If the adopter has someone that they feel comfortable giving the dog to, I'll ask that the new adopter fill out an application so I have something on file.     I ask that my adopters keep me updated once in a while. Usually I send out a mass email at the first of the year asking how everyone is doing. I'd say 90% of my adopters respond. I have a few that email me pictures and updates on a regular basis. This week alone I've had updates from four adopters. It just makes me feel good to know the dog I took care of is still being cared for.    I also will not adopt to somebody more than 100 miles from me. Sorry, but I'm not sending a dog I love off to another state sight unseen never to be seen or heard from again. I don't micro-manage my adopters, but I do want to know "my" dogs are safe!    Edit to add:    For those who have a problem with updates, I have to ask why. I'm not saying you have to tell me every little thing. But it's common courtesy to let me know that the dog I cared for for several months is still doing well. This morning I received an email from an adopter I hadn't heard from in over a year. It simply said:    "Hi ****!   It's been a while since I've checked in with you guys for ******, so I thought I'd take a second and do that today. She's still doing wonderful and I am just just so blessed to have her in my life. I'm hoping to eventually get her to another one of the adoption events at PetCo but have no idea when.  Sometime in the next few weeks so she can say hello.  :) I'm attaching a few recent pictures of her for you.  Some were taken today while we were outside playing in the snow.  She is just too darn funny! Hope all is going well."    Really, is that too much to ask?|`|WQECudWkaa	Too many restrictions discourage hopeful adopters.  It did for me.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Usually a rescue dog comes from an abusive home, or has been abandoned or surrendered, etc.  In other words, this dog needs a break.  I think their adoption policies are sound.  How would you feel if you rescued a dog only to have it go to someone who would be abusive or not take proper care of the dog?  As to requiring a certain type of food - I think that's great as long as it's a good quality.  Every day on this forum, there are a dozen questions (at least) of what is the best dog food and how to feed a dog, so recommending a good dog food to potential adopters is a good idea.  These rescue agencies have the dog's best interests in mind and that's as it should be.  I think their standards are good ones and should be supported.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	I think they are just responsible practises in order to ensure a good life for the dogs being adopted.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	I agree with their policies. I think these things are needed to be done, in order to make sure that the dog is going to a home, that is going to love and properly provide for the dog. Families that want to adopt, need to be screened first! If they were to just adopt a dog out to anyone, there is no guarantee that the dog will not be used for fighting or that the dog will not be abused!|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Usually I think a lot of it depends on the individual dog.    We never had a home visit.   But the did want to check with our apartment complex on the pet policies before they approved and they wanted a vet reference and a personal reference.    We got to take our puppy home a few hours later.      (We found her on Petfinder.com and we put in the application and were in contact with the lady who ran the rescue. and once we were approved she agreed to meet us that night)    Sasha came home with us that night (and its a good thing a bad storm blew through and a lot of roads were impassable out where we went to get her.....we might have had to wait a few days so)    I feel the policies are in place for a reason but I think they are stricter with some dogs than others
WebaFPgsaa	I have a hedgehog and it is happy and active. But whatever you do... DON'T GET IT CAT FOOD! Get it kitten food instead. Hedgehogs have strong teeth but it is harder for them to eat cat food. kitten food on the other hand has all the nutrition's it needs and its slightly softer on it's teeth. Hedgehog food is ok for it, but I found that it didn't eat as much of it.  For treats they can have some Fruit, meal worms, and crickits.  And if people say that they are not friendly or they are not to be taken out, that's not true. My hedgehog will lay down on my stomache and watch T.V with me, and I can even rub it's belly sometimes. And sometimes it will get affectionate and start licking my fingers. Although when you take it out, I would suggest gloves if your skin is soft.(I have to wear them sometimes). They're great pets to have! Hope you enjoy it:)|`|5M57TTfpaa	My hedgehog eats cat food, i dont think it matters what brand as i just get whats on sale(a big bag, shared with my cat).

A cousin to the spitz type dogs, this pampered lap dog once called the arctic home.     Bred down to its tiny size over the centuries, the Pomeranian became popular in the late 1800s when Queen Victorian brought a 12 pound Pom back from Italy. This vivacious little dog soon became a favorite of European royalty and was bred to be even smaller until it reached the average of 5 pounds.    Historically, the Pomeranian has been fancied by many famous Europeans. Michelangelo had a little Pom that sat on a silk pillow and watched him while he painted the Sistine Chapel. Martin Luther, the great church leader had one of these little dogs that he mentioned often in his work. Mozart had a Pomeranian that he dedicated an Aria to and Chopin composed the Valse des Petits Chiens for his girlfriends Pom.    Care and Grooming    Pomeranians are easy to care for but do need some special attention. They can be easily groomed in less than 1 hour a day, but I am sure you will want to spend much more time than that bonding with your pet!    Brushing your Pomeranian every day is a good way to bond with your pet as well as insure his coat is healthy and looks good. Poms have a double coat that can easily become matted so brushing is necessary. A once a week - or every couple of weeks - bath is a nice way to keep your Pom smelling and looking good! Dont forget to groom around his paws and tail area as well as clip his nails.    Unfortunately, Pomeranians can be prone to tooth problems. Tooth loss and bacterial buildup is not uncommon in these little dogs so you should take extra care to make sure your pet has the proper dental care. Brush your dogs teeth daily with a specially formulated enzymatic tooth paste that fights bacteria and have yearly dental checks and scaling if necessary. Tooth care is quite important to your dogs overall health as if bacteria is left unchecked in the mouth, it can spread throughout the dogs body and cause health problems for your pet.    The Poms eyes are another area where you should pay some special attention. Like most small dogs, discharge from the eye can accumulate causing staining and, sometimes a goopy mess. Clean the area around the eye daily with a Q-tip (be careful not to get too close to the dogs eye). If the fur around the eye becomes stained, you can buy a special liquid that helps remove the staining.    Health Problems    Luxating Patellas or a knee that slips out of place is common in Pomeranians and in some cases this may require surgery. Many Poms suffer from hypothyroidism which can cause other problems and should be checked by your vet. Some Poms lose patches of hair as they grow older. This usually starts at the back and moves forward. If your Pom sounds like he is coughing then he may have a collapsing trachea which is not uncommon in this breed. An xray can determine if this is the problem and medication can be given to reduce coughing. Tooth loss and bacteria build up is a problem in Pomeranians as well as other small dogs.|`|s76aC4G8aa	yes they yap like crazy the only way to discourage this behavior is to not reinforce it and only give attention when the dog is NOT barking it's head off.  That way it learns barking = nothing.    However, my friends Pom only barks at dogs and cars and doesn't bark in the house.  She has not been able to successfully stop this dog from barking like crazy outside.|`|tlnWgAXUaa	My grandma has a Pom Pom butt(our nickname that we gave him) so I go to her house all the time and he (Dusty) was in my life all 18 years..      Pros-  Fluffy  cute  adorable  rarely bites(can be a con)  fun to play with  safe to be around children  funny  good watch dogs  good purse dogs  rarely begs(for your food)  energetic  playful    Cons-  loud  sorta/kinda mean  poop a lot inside  rarely bites(can be a pro)        as you can see Pom Poms are really good dogs  good luck deciding!!|`|5uwfpC8oaa	I was warned off having a pomeranian but i owned two  while than can bark a bit you can discourage this not giving them the attention and distracting them when they display this behavior  i found them to be quite loyal and good with little kids.  i think it depends a lot on how they are treated and the time spent training them.  they do require quite a bit of grooming but are a great companion and really cute!|`|jN98MkiVaa	Well ive had pomeranians for about 4 years i have 2. They do bark alot but if you train them well you can let them know that its not okay to bark over every little noise or thing. My Princess actually never had a problem with barking until she had her first litter. But i had to retrain her by staying near and telling her NO!! everytime she would start barking for no reason. But i love the breed they are by far the smartest dogs i have ever had. Another thing is just keep up with their grooming my dogs have a lot of hair more than most poms, but a bi weekly shower and a good conditioner is all you need! Good luck and i hope you fall in love with the pomeranian as i did.
kEQX5sswaa	I'd keep it in the room with the litter box or make it live outside.|`|y7igESfUaa	When cats stop going in their litterbox it could be caused by a number of different reasons. Cats usually will spray (urine) to mark their territory, not use feces. Perhaps there is an underlying health problem that is causing this behavior.    Please don't "shove her nose in it", cats do not understand this. They are clean animals. Also, do not shout or hit, she will not understand this either. Instead, try picking her up and placing her in her litterbox. Or, if you haven't caught her in the act, pick up her droppings and place them in the litterbox. This way, you'll be showing her that the litterbox is the correct place for her to do her business.    If you are ready to get rid of your cat just because of a slight problem, I would maybe suggest it. She's not doing this on purpose and will need time and patience to get back into the groove. Locking her in the laundry room will only confuse her more. Please try to be gentle with her.    Good luck to you and your cat.|`|phAqOpzZaa	this is what i do...dont rub there noes in the poop make her smell it and tell her no thats bad then pick her up and show her where is the cat litter make her smell it and say good...then put her in there...she may walk around in it or run...but she will learn! just be patient it should only take a week...then make sure the litter box is clean twice a day unless she wont go in there...my cats only poop around the house if its not clean...and maybe she doesn't like the litter too...i buy litter w/a good scent!|`|AA10073814	Either she's showing you that she is unhappy with the change (i.e. your son walking) or she has a digestive problem.     Try the Feliway someone suggested and talk to your vet. He may have some suggestions.     Please give her a chance. If you must get rid of her, don't drop her at a shelter, they will put her to sleep. Contact a local rescue group who will get her adopted.|`|bwjf8D31aa	can i borrow it need a new carpet and id say my room is small i can judge it better by swinging a cat .|`|KK8zsJz2aa	well, try puting the cat right in front of it and flicking the cats ear and yelling. it worked when my cat started jumping on the counter. if tha does not work, the put the cat in a cat carrier when the cat does it again. keep doing that until the cat realizes that it is not something he/she should do. if neither of those work, then take the cat to the vet. he/she might be sick. my cat used to come in the house and immediatly poop on the floor. turned out he was sick. maybe your cat has the same problem. hope this helps. :)|`|j2yHX3mOaa	Try Feliway spray is a pheromone spray and it calms cats as well as deters them from unwanted spraying and pooing, spray where the cat goes too the toilet. I have used it with my cat and her 5 kittens and it works straight away, also its good to spray in the carry case when you take cat too the vet, hope it works for you, it would be a shame to get rid of it, your cat probably is feeling stressed out by the baby which is why its doing it, please try the spray I think they do room atomisers as well. Good luck x|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Shoving a cats nose in feces will not help. Is that how you potty train your child? When a cat who has been housebroken starts to go other places there are two possible reasons. One, the cat is sick. Has kitty been to the vet> Two, the cat is trying to get a message across to you. Perhaps, the cat misses the attention you use to give her. Try lavishing her with as much love as possible. I know you have a child and this is difficult. Please, please if things do not work out., do the right thing. Try to find a loving home or take her to a no-kill shelter.

3urpilpBaa	How long has this been going on?  "Suddenly", like overnight?  Any throwing up or diarrhea?  Royal Canin is a great food and should not be causing upset unless you just switched him over to it.  If he is outside, or inside, unsupervised he may have ingested something.  Feed him small amounts of rice and boiled chicken (if he will eat it) and see if he feels better.  Keep an eye on him and if more symptoms pop up like lethargy, vomit, etc call a vet and take him in for an examination.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	That's normal at this age, he's not growing as fast so he's not as hungry.    Just put the food down like normal and don't fuss about it.  He'll eat what he needs to, when he's hungry.    Fussing over him, addings stuff to his food, switching foods, all just train him to be a picky eater.|`|y2Hrm4ioaa	Even my doggie(labrador) has become a fussy eater after he turned a year.I think it is natural|`|nYv65TlEaa	dogs go through this often,and if he had been changed to adult dog food that too can be the problem,let him be fussy,but don't change his food,when he is hungry,he'll eat,  if you try another food and he eats it then he gets fussy again,starting a new one won't be good,  stick it out,as long as he is playful,he drinks,don't worry he won't starve  no table food,he'll hold out for that...    My friends dog refused to eat for 2 days,he was happy go lucky,played went on his walks drank plenty of water,finally on the 3rd day he went to his bowl and ate,mind you,it was fresh kibble daily,she would throw out what he didn't eat for the 2 days|`|nI8G21y8aa	my dod did that and it was very difficult to feed her.    think how boring it would be eating dry dog food for your whole life.

Then, make sure you have the right kind of dog food. Sometimes people get Dog food instead of puppy food, or maybe something else. Make sure he is comfortable with his home invirement. (He probably is.) Thats all I got for now, Good Luck!!! : )|`|AA12149581	I just watched a Dog Whisperer episode on this topic. Walk/exercise the dog vigorously before meals. Make the dog work for food and he will want it. You can make the food more appealing to the dog in some way (gravies, etc) but make sure that every single kibble is covered in it, so that the dog cannot pick out what he wants. Limit biscuits.     I am assuming that there is nothing wrong with the food. We recently got a batch of a certain brand of dog food that our girl refused to eat. I thought it smelled funny, too, just a little "off." I returned it and brought home a different bag with a different date code on the bag. She had no problems with that batch.|`|DRqfAwDvaa	Very unusual for a Labrador Retriever not to eat! If your dog is acting normal otherwise, drinking, playing, no fever, no diarrhea you can try this. Put his food down at the normal time to eat, give him 10 minutes and if he does not eat it then take it away. Do not give him anything until his next meal. Do the same thing, only 10 minutes then take it away. He will realize that it disappears when he does not eat it and will begin eating after doing this a few times. Don't worry he won't starve!  If he does not eat after a few meals, example, breakfast, dinner and then breakfast the next day, then I would bring him to the Vet. as something is wrong...  Good Luck
a29qiNkvaa	I would try a grain free dog food! Both of my dogs have skin allergies. My male has a very sensitive tummy! I stared off feeding EVO, I did not have time to slowly change I prepared for the worst! Normally he vomits, stops eating and then get the runs! But to my surprise he did not get any of them! Then a few weeks ago I had to go out of town and once again had to change his food and I when to a other grain free called barking at the moon and the same nothing! They both actually seem to like this food better! I have noticed a big difference is the shedding as well! I have 2 large Akitas, so I am sure they shed just as much!     Here are a few grain free foods that are amazing!!!     EVO   Solid Gold- Barking at the moon  Taste of the wild- I would have my dogs on this food but I cant feed chicken, my female is allergic!       by the way Eukanuba is a tasty food!

They had to put him on a special dog food for his skin allergies which also was good for his stomach.  I can't remember the name, but it is all natural and made of venison.  It's expensive but better than allergy meds!  After about 3 weeks on the new food, he was a new dog....his sores started healing up and he stopped ripping his fur out (which is probably why you're finding hair everywhere).  Good luck!|`|fMRcX2WDaa	go to a chuck and dons they specialize in dog foods and buy nutria source dog food it doesn't have wheat or corn in it those are the most common foods that GS are allergic to. or you CAN try him on a raw food diet look up but make sure you feed him veggies to as well as meat if you do that allot of people don't give them veggies and they get severely constipated|`|3urpilpBaa	I agree with Jennifer.  I have a Border Collie who was a skin disaster when we got him.  It sounds a lot like what you are going through.  I switched him to NutroMax, not the most expensive on the market but high quality, and there was a noticeable difference in 2 weeks.  He was allergic to corn.  All Euk food contains corn.  Try switching to see if there is a difference (some Nutro food does have corn, check the label).  The scab sounds like a problem and I would go to the vet to get a skin scraping to rule out mange.  Good luck!|`|GduRpnn0aa	There are two things that you can try: First, give your dog a herbal allergy supplement called Stimmune and, Second, bathe your dog using Neem Soap.    Stimmune will boost your dog's immune system and help him deal with his canine allergies. It's also useful in treating a dog's fatigue or recurring infections. Here is the link : http://www.petwellbeing.com/dog-allergie...    Dog allergies may be caused by a number of factors including poor diet and changes in your dog's lifestyle (including environment and food). When a dog has an allergy, his body develops and abnormal reaction to substances. Different dogs may react very differently, even if theyre allergic to the same thing.    Often, the "substance" a dog is allergic to is in its own body. The dog's body then reacts against itself, just like in the case of an auto-immune disease.    It's often tricky to determine exactly what a dog is allergic to. But it's important to make the effort, as much discomfort can often be avoided simply by ensuring your dog isn't exposed to the allergen.    Neem Soap helps to repel insects which can cause allergies. It also acts as an Anti-bacterial and Anti-fungal soap that cleans a dogs fur and eliminates odors, leaving your dog's coat soft and smelling nice.      http://www.petwellbeing.com/dog-natural-...|`|m4uDn0ofaa	You should take him to your vet and ask them.  To me it sounds like multiple problems ranging from dry skin to mange, but I'm not a professional so I can't say for sure.  You really really should take him to the vet.

e87cd8e8c653d0f68402573b2d9f3ef1aa	You probably won't get a decent answer here but, I had a similar issue with my dog last summer.. Though it doesn't involve medicine.. Ever since she was born here 4 years ago nobody but my mother, father, brother and myself lived in the house.. nobody stayed over for extended periods.. Than my brother left and than my other brother, sisterinlaw, niece and nephew [16 months and 3 years old] moved in..    Her attitude went from playful and spunky to aggressive and nipping at my nephew.. Yes he would chase her but that would be that and if he entered a room she was in she'd bark and lunge at him.. It was because strangers invaded her home and she felt threatened [plus the kids were always clinging to me and she got little attention] But once they moved out and showed up periodically she'd run to them and lick them and be her normal peppy self.    But to be sure talk to your vet.. My uncle's dog started acting weird and nipping people.. they found out he was diabetic.. going blind and alot of other problems [poor dog=(]|`|gwUMipsUaa	Call your vet and tell him what's going on.

Get an experienced dog trainer to work with you on these issues.
L22hVXTIaa	Yes, the smaller and toy breeds do tend to live a few more years than the larger breeds.  On average, a large breed dog is considered old at 10 -12 yrs., while a smaller breed dog reaches an average age of 14 - 16 yrs.  Of course, there are always exceptions to these, but they are average life spans.|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	Yes they usually do.  The larger the dog the shorter the life span.  Breeds like Pomeranians,Dachshunds, and Yorkies tend to live around15-20 years.  Medium to large size dogs like Australian Shepherds, Border collies, and Golden Retrievers tend to live up too 15 years.  And the giant of breeds like Mastiffs, and St. Bernards tend to live around 8-10 years.  But this is just in general some little dogs don't make it to 10 years old and some giant dogs live to be around 15 years old.|`|ElKJmu6Qaa	sometimes yes, sometimes no|`|VWs1IrXwaa	In general, yes.  But it also depends on the breed and what type of health problems that breed is prone to getting.  And of course it depends on what type of place you get it from and how you take care of it.  But in most cases small dogs do tend to have longer life spans.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Probably.  But I had a Belgian Sheepdog mix and Beagle both live to be 14.  My GSD mix had to be put down when she was 8.  My Toy Poodle is only 2, so I have no idea how long she'll live.|`|3giaPYe8aa	In general, yes.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	In most cases yes, because look at the toy poodle conpared to a Neapolitan Mastiff. My moms friend had two poodles who lived to be 23 and 24 years old, and the maximum life for a Neapolitan Mastiff is about 10 years. But small, medium, and large breeds have their genetic problems.|`|M7yJJKB9aa	Absolutely yes. The smaller the dog, the longer the life. A chihuahua can live for well over 15 years, a great dane around 8 years. I love some of the larger breeds, but this is exactly why I choose the little ones.
AA11089392	Cats just vomit sometimes and it isn't always something to worry about. If the cat continues to eat that is a good sign. Cats sometimes eat too fast and tummy can't handle it. The irritation causes them to send it back where it came from. Hairballs often make cats vomit. Did you see any foreign objects other than the food?  Bottom line if the cat continues to eat and doesn't continue to vomit. If there was no blood in the vomit and the cat seems happy and active it probably isn't anything to worry about. Otherwise make an appointment with the vet.  Check to make sure the cat us doing number 2 and that it's normal. If not, another good reason to call the vet.  I don't have much experience with cats but recently I got kind of alarmed when my wife's cat vomited a little blood. The vet was not too concerned and checked her out. Just a little irritation that went away on it's own. On the other hand she had an older cat that vomited almost daily, his  2 was almost always runny and he was loosing weight. Vet couldn't find the problem despite several tests. When she finally had to put him down vet though he could feel some tumors. His decline took a couple of years in this case.  If you are worried about tap water try using a filter pitcher like Britta or Pur. The make the water taste much better.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	It happens. Sometimes when a young kitten gets a hairball it doesnt quite know how to hack it up, thus resulting in vomiting. If she is fine now, I would just keep an eye on her to make sure she is okay.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	Kittens can die in a day or two from dehydration---please spend the money and go to a vet--emergency vet's are open 24/7...|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Call the vet!

Take a sample (about 1/2 cup) to a pet store and have it tested. Make sure the food you give her was not on the list for recalled cat food. Some liquor stores that sell cat food still have it on their shelves. I know there are stores around my area that still have it. If your kitten isn't getting enough water then it is possible that she is drinking from puddles in the street, which could have antifreeze in them. Make sure there is always water down for her to drink, and that she knows where it is. Since she didn't vomit after the water that was boiled and cooled, I would keep doing that until you get the results from the water test or until you find out what is causing the problem.|`|gUy60Efhaa	Do not risk anything, go to the vet!!!!!

Go ASAP|`|8IZrK7Guaa	my vet gave my pet a very bland food that helped out and it turned out he was eating and drinking to fast that made my dog and cat sick     but if your concerned contact the vet|`|wKjxESbBaa	water then the vet ASAP.|`|SNLFVblhaa	call the vet right now!|`|mb7h0wDJaa	just take her to the vet before the cats starts vomiting again|`|wntdMR8caa	do what ever works.. though, as a good rule of thumb, NEVER ask medical questions on yahoo. it makes you seem retarded. go see a vet if you're seriously concerned. even calling them over the phone should help alot. sometimes you dont even need to go in or pay anything and just do what they tell you to do over the phone.|`|iJbslaQNaa	my cat MICKUN...he died of vomitting so much. GET YOUR CAT TO VET STRAIGHTWAY!|`|bwjf8D31aa	punch it and make it know you are angry at the vomit mess its made. buy a rottweiler and say 'hes gonna eat your stupid cat face if you puke again madam'|`|IR8rDz0Paa	vet|`|8tYTSN3Kaa	maybe it has worms... take to the vet asap!!!|`|XvaaaadYaa	take her to the vet. Thats all you can really do.|`|0OZSkiYQaa	take her to the vet|`|cqvgu02Saa	The Vet man!!!|`|qlOx8wK6aa	i would try a different food for now. i used to always have kittens and when they did that is was cuz they wanted a different food or because they had a hairball.     good luck!!|`|b56dc16844b5612211ab9d8a995d6192aa	your cat may have pareasite or some sort of infecction.    go to the a cat-doctor near you.|`|8pLDp9rOaa	Yes, boil water and let it go cold for her to drink, if she loses her appetite do the same with the water but mix a little bit of sugar in it to give her energy.  It's good that she is eating and playing.  If it keeps happening it's best to phone your vet or if it's closed call an emergency vet and they'll be able to give you advise.    Good luck, hope she feels better soon.|`|BmI2fszPaa	How old is she? Cats often vomit if they are having trouble passing a hairball. This would not be the case for a young kitten though. Does she hack sometimes? Is she constipated recently? If so, get some Laxatone or other hairball remedy from the petstore. Its cheap.  Otherwise if you have a young kitten, take it to the vet a.s.a.p.|`|AA11305262	ok, don't be scared! cats are very strong animals, it's not just a saying that they have 7 lives, i'm always surprised what my cat goes through sometimes (he is very curious and goes outside a lot and eats pretty much everything that moves and is fun to play with)... if you want to be sure - go to the vet! but i'd recommend that you wait a bit and see if it gets better... if it doesn't stop go to the vet after a few days! vomitting can be (how old's your cat?) a sign of a tumor (that's what my f*** vet didn't realize when i went to him with the cat i had before... the cat almost died when another vet finally realized that it's a tumor :'-( ...) but then it wouldn't occur from one day to another...   hope your cat feels better soon!!|`|D8yUwIJJaa	My cat does this too.  Her stomach is sensitive, so we have to give her bottled water and Science Diet, ask your vet.|`|apAOPIjraa	call the vet
dE5fs9yzaa	Warm the car up before placing your container in there. Is the tank ready where you are going? If it is, and you are getting the fish from a store, ask them to double bag it for you. If you are transporting from your (or a friends) place to another, and the fish is fairly small then put it in a container where the water will cover it completely, by a few inches but not a container thats so small it looks squeezed. Make sure whatever you cover the top keeps water inside...so it doesn't come out. When I transported fish for show I used deep buckets with covers. You can bag the fish yourself like a pet store would too. Just make sure to keep the car warm..not hot...but warm and get it to its new home fast! Let it acclimated to the new tank too.|`|8wnvhBQTaa	The temperture isn't that much of a problem as long as you have as much air as water in the bag the fish shouldbe fine.|`|9uyQ51Uoaa	This is easy- if you have one a small styrofoam cooler works well- just rinse it thouroghly before you use it- fill it with tank water and add your fish- 45 minutes is not far. If you keep the fish on the passengerside floorboard then you can turn on some heat in the car- just a low setting. Remeber fish usually travel from florida to your fish dealears and they survive much longer trips. If you dont have a small styrofoam cooler you can use a NEW plastic bucket- you can buy them with or without lids at any hardware store. Just make sure you rinse it thouroughly as well to rid any manufacturing residue. im sure your fishies will survive the trip. have fun good luck!|`|2GOlof0Taa	45 minutes is fine in the bag they come in, my local fish shop is about an hour away, imagine how they get transported across the globe in cold aeroplanes for hours on end and then driven to the fish shops, don't worry, as long as the fish has some water he'll do fine|`|AA12385231	45 minutes?  Tuck it inside your shirt or jacket, body heat will keep it warm.  Done this plenty of times in the dead of winter, no need for coolers, heatpacks, or any of that for a single bag.      Keep it simple....|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	wow..i transported a whole saltwater tank, corals, fish, sand, water, everything with no fatalities...you think its hard transporting an angel fish?  go to the store and buy a new cooler, or even a rubber made and take the water that is in your tank and put the fish inside. just make sure it doesnt slosh around inside.but yes, this should be an easy move :) good luck!|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Bag the fish like the pet shop does and put it in a cooler bin, or a cardboard box with a towel wrapped around it. It will be fine.    The inside of a car is usually fairly warm anyway, so the fish wont get very cold. If it's winter you have the heater on, if it's summer you have the aircon on.    I live 1/2 an hour from my petshop, so all my fish come home that way.    Ian|`|QZ0nUuOEaa	We've moved fish quite a few times.  If you have a decent heater in the car it shouldn't be any problem.  Make sure that you have everything ready for your journey so putting your angel fish in at the last moment.  Put it in the biggest polythene bag you can manage with more air space than water, it's air it really needs.  The fish will be able to take a small drop in water temperature but if you are worried an old fashioned hot water bottle will give enough heat to get you through the journey.  If you have a thermometer put that in with the fish so you can monitor the heat so that the temperature doesn't get too hot with the bottle. Obviously you also need everything ready at the other end too so that you can pop the polythene bag straight into a tank. DON'T however pour the fish straight into the tank as the water temperature in the tank and that in the bag might not be the same, let the bag float in the tank until both water temperatures are the same.  Abrupt changes in temperature either up or down is what is really bad for any fish.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	How big are they?    The bag method that they came from the pet shop in should be Ok unless they can't be held upright. If they are going to be on their sides a clean bucket with cellophane over the top. Just spike air holes with a kitchen fork.    Either way 45 minutes isn't a long trip :o)
VMY7No0eaa	Yes I use to belong to the Opossum soc.  I have seen adults and babies too.  Where Socal in the mountains.  one came to my back door to eat cat food evening. about 6-8      found a baby in a trash can. cute as a button... big button eyes.  mom had probably gone in there to see if there was something to eat and the baby (clinging to her back) fell off  It was old enough to live on it's own so I just released it into the hedge.  morning it was about the size of an apple.  they are really good animals eat black widow spiders.  and fallen fruit.   get along with cats but dogs often kill them (as do cars because they saunter along and don't run fast)|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Yes I've seen them many times crossing the street, in my neighborhood, over in woodlands in garabge cans all over. The last time I saw one was at my Aunties house on top a wooden fence it was about 12:00a.m.|`|QRFXQwGqaa	OMG, OPOSSOMS! Heck yes I've seen one. One scurried up into my tree over yonder. And I just ran up and grabbed that sucker. Then I took heem into my kitchen and boiled the bugger. That was a gooden.|`|iX9ppJHvaa	Yes, I have seen them. Minnesota and Wisconsin, mostly farm country, though still occuring as you get closer to the suburbs. They are most commonly on the roads as they come out of the woods. Mostly at night, I have never seen one during the day. Its mostly Opossums and Deer that I see on the side of the road (dead) and I have to admit, I did accidently run one over myself (I also did stop, and make sure it was dead) The ones that I have seen seemed to be full body weight, didnt seem to have any malnutrition, about a foot long or so? Most of the time I was driving so I couldnt say for sure.   Hope that helps.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Yes I saw one in Bucks County PA about a half mile from Van Saint Airport. She was in the middle of the road in the middle of the afternoon. Her tail was up over her back and six little ones were riding on her back with their tails rapped around her tail. She was about the size of a small cat and the babies bodies were three and a half to four inches long. So adorable.|`|3z3P6j49aa	Yes, It was at Fort Totten (old military place), NYC at like 11 pm.   Eh, looked like it would be 10 pounds.|`|Spycl8Ikaa	Yes i've seen one. There was one in my backyard a couple years ago. We put some rotton fruit and stuff out there and it found the fruit and started eating one of the bannanas. My friend and I followed it around the whole night and filmed it. It was very friendly and nice.|`|H3LJNfh6aa	Yes.   i have seen tons. i live in north west Florida, about an hour above Panama City[if you know where that is:)]  i see them quite often accually. they are all around where i live, and they've came up and started munching down on cat food right along with our cats. We usually see them out at night. :)    hope this is help. :]     btw, i do live in the sticks.:)))  ahh haa.|`|ssiqDLKsaa	yeah, i was at my cousins down the street from me and it was about the size of a normal cat|`|S0ycwz6Naa	Yes. I was little, in my shore house by a bay/woods.  It came out at night. it was in my friend's bed, at the bottom. so we took it into the woods. but I'm pretty sure it was big. I do know i was scared.  good luck!|`|NEWbh3Plaa	I see them all the time.  Usually every spring one near my house has babies and they always manage to hang themselves from my back porch.  I know I shouldn't but I unhook their little tails and put them in near a tree or something so my dogs don't find them.  I live in central Pennsylvania, I see at all different times and I have seen them from babies (about 6 inch bodies) up to adults the biggest being probably about 15 pounds and maybe 12-15 inches long-not including the tail
AA12289981	I named my last cat Tarquin.  He seemed to like it.|`|cMRJ8jMUaa	Could always name any cat Mr/Ms Fluffy...then you could call them fluff, fluffy, whatever.    I also like bubbles for a pet name but i don't have any pets so what do i know :D  Oh wait, i did have a hampster for 2 weeks that i called scrufy.|`|Dhsyroekaa	maybe wait until you pick your cat out then see what it looks like. Then maybe a name will come to you!|`|pA4GHLXcaa	I like trinity.|`|niackm5uaa	My cats are named Bailey and Abby... they're pretty basic names, but the next boy cat I get I want to name him Clark lol.. I just think it would funny.|`|pe69KF3Taa	yes, your suggested names are lame- they don't appeal to me. =\  take an adjective and mess with it.   Feline:    Fifi, Fefe, Feefee, Fi-Fi, Fe-Fe, Fee-Fee, Felaine (rhymes w/ Elaine), Felyne, Felion, or Felyon.|`|76JPOo3Raa	Mr.Cat or Mrs.Cat.or maybe Kitty.or Ciate.|`|BmI2fszPaa	I think cats should have real names. Like Monty, Boris, Max, etc. I like Hendrix and Bowie and Trinity too. Wait until you find your kitty, then you will know what suits him or her.|`|D8yUwIJJaa	sticky buns, just in case they tend to get caught on the furniture or rug.|`|bwjf8D31aa	Kuntface works fine.|`|AA11305262	my cat's name is idefix. i think slash or pistol sounds good! if i were you i'd try to find a name once you know a little more about your cats personality that makes it easier to find a name. you have musicians in your cat-names list, maybe you can try to find out what music your cat likes best... i'm serious about this - a little story: when i was 12 years old the movie titanic was in theatres, the radio stations played "my heart will go on" by celine dion all the time. whenever it was on, my cat left the room!! i bought a celine dion cd and whenever i played any song on it, my cat just left... :)

Yes he is cute!
p8DiswLLaa	Usually if they are vomiting more than 1 or 2 times and stops eating, this is a sign that something is blocking them up and as they are small creatures, this is a lot more serious.  Bring him in to the vet asap.  He/she can run tests and check out your cat and determine what is wrong.    1/30/09  How is your cat doing now?|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	I have cats that do this from time to time, and it's nothing. With mine, they've either eaten too fast, too much, or waited too long before eating........    Since this seems to be something NEW for YOUR cat, I'd advise a trip to the vet.......JUST TO MAKE SURE.  If nothing is wrong......GREAT...now you can stop worrying!    BUT.......if it turns out that something IS wrong, you'll be glad you got him checked out before (whatever) got worse.    He may have gotten into one of your plants, licked the floor after it was mopped with a bleach solution, etc .......    If he ever goes outside, he may have "nibbled" on something that has his tummy upset......    Hope it's just a "phase"........Good luck.|`|rk7sN9Ryaa	I would take him to the vet.  He is lethargic and has been vomiting for 2 days.  How many times has he vomited?  Has he gotten into anything at the house?|`|BmI2fszPaa	vet!|`|0e41a4749e1ba186aebb9d38fb66cf58aa	The best thing IS to go to the vet. That way, you would not have to worry anymore. I personally do not like cats or have have one, but the best thing to do is go to see a vet. Trust me, you should do it.|`|AA11305262	maybe he has worms.     i don't want to scare you, i just tell you what my experiences are: i had a cat that started vomiting a lot, i went to the vet who was too stupid to realize what it really was: a tumor... when i went to another vet, he said that vomiting over a longer period of time can be a sign of a tumor!     the cat i have now vomits sometimes when he drinks milk (we don't give it to him but he's incredibly smart when it comes to finding something good to eat or drink)
ZT0K3q2Aaa	Here are some good ones appropriate for puppies:  * Merrick Puppy Plate, Turducken, Wilderness Blend  * Canidae all-life-stages  * Wellness Just for Puppy  * Artemis Fresh Mix puppy  * Innova puppy  * Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul  (more brands further down in this answer)    Many of the higher quality food now days are "all-life-stages", so they work for both puppies and adults, you just vary the amount you feed by age, size, and activity level.    === ===    Read the ingredients before you buy.    Here is my "short list" of rules when I am looking at dog food ingredients:  1) When I chose a dog food, I chose one high meat content. I want to see preferably at least 2-3 out of the top 5 ingredients be meat or meat meal (first ingredient must be!). Meal is simply the meat with the moisture removed.  2) I want to see higher quality grains, such as barley, brown rice, and oatmeal, instead of seeing wheat and corn. Or an alternative starch/carbohydrate such as potatoes or sweet potatoes.  3) I don't want to see any byproducts.  4) I don't want to see a lot of fillers (beet pulp, brewers rice, etc).  5) I don't want to see preservatives that are believed to be carcinogens (BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin).  6) I don't want to see artificial colorings such as the Red, Blue, and Yellow dyes.  7) I don't want to see added sugars (sugar, corn syrup).  8) I don't want to see mystery meats (meats identified only as "meat" or "poultry".)      Here are some examples of GOOD dog foods:  * Artemis Fresh Mix  * Blue Buffalo  * California Natural  * Canidae  * Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul  * Eagle Pack Holistic Selects  * EVO  * Fromm Four Star  * Innova  * Merrick  * Nature's Variety  * Orijen  * Solid Gold  * Taste of the Wild  * Wellness  * ZiwiPeak|`|AA12083992	This is the ingredients list of their puppy food:  Ingredients: Chicken meal, rice, brown rice, chicken fat, corn gluten meal, chicken, dried egg product, natural chicken flavor, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), dried brewers yeast, sodium silico aluminate, powdered cellulose, potassium chloride, soya oil, psyllium seed husk, fructo-oligosaccharides, salt, L-lysine, dried brewers yeast extract (source of mannan-oligosaccharides), Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), biotin, D-calcium pantothenate, vitamin A acetate, niacin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplement, folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], taurine, choline chloride, DL-methionine, glucosamine hydrochloride, Trace Minerals [zinc proteinate, zinc oxide, ferrous sulfate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, sodium selenite, calcium iodate], L-carnitine, chondroitin sulfate, marigold extract (Tagetes erecta L.), preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of Vitamin E) and citric acid, rosemary extract.     There are a few things wrong with this food, the first two being meal as the first ingredient and it contains corn. Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available. If you want to learn more check out: http://www.sagekeep.com/petfood.htm    www.api4animals.org/facts?p=359& more=1    http://animalark.eapps.com/animal/PetFoo...|`|QLopvWKDaa	Royal Canin is an excellent quality dog food.  I like the fact that they even have breed specific food.  it may seem silly, but I found it important with a small breed, becayse they need smaller bites and more nutrition per bite.    Check it out!  http://www.royalcanin.us/products/defaul...|`|bIFkehwzaa	Royal canin is fine. it contains no by-products.|`|BDWRmCh7aa	if it is "puppy" food then it is probably fine. if you don't mind paying extra, you can go to Petco or a Pet Store and there is a brand ( i cant think of the name of it) and they have special puppy and dog food for small dogs by their breed. my sister gets it for her Yorkie. they have different foods under that brand for different small breeds.|`|0FqHqOx1aa	Royal Canin isnt the best food out there by ANY MEANS. Go to www.dogfoodanalysis.com for some good reviews. See how yours rates on there. I'd give the puppy Solid Gold Puppy Food.. Rates a 5 Star of 6 and is a great brand. Also, Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance isnt bad either at 4 stars. Its ALL in the ingredients. Please make sure there is no corn, wheat, byproducts etc. You want 2 meat sources in the first 3 ingredients. If it says MEAL after the name its better then just saying chicken.. now if it says Chicken BYPRODUCT MEAL thats a problem. Meal basically means they groud up and dehydrate the stuff making it more potent so to speak. So like I said if it is Chicken Meal, Salmon Meal etc GREAT and if its just Chicken or Salmon etc thats good too.|`|H2eaqPE0aa	My vet recommends it. Why are you concerned?|`|j93Is17Taa	"Halo" is an excellent food that uses human grade ingredients. Be wary of foods that use "glutens" as a cheap protein source.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	Go to www.dogfoodanalysis.com  I would suggest nothing less than a 4 5 star food. If you want to get food at PetCo, maybe Wellness or Blue Buffalo. Since its a small dog and won't eat much, in theory you should be able to afford a more expensive food.|`|qJTInlSeaa	Hi... and congrats on your shih tzu...    I have fed my 2 tzu's Wellness Just for Puppy.  There are no fillers or garbage in there.  Overall a great dog food.  Although a little pricey, it is well worth it.    Now that they are no longer pups, I feed them both Wellness Super 5 Mix Small Bites.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	Personally I use Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul brand of food (it is what my breeder recommended for our puppy.).  But I would use whatever your breeder recommended you use for your puppy.  Usually breeders know what is best.|`|f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	Go with Blue Buffalo, it is an excellent dog food, it is reasonably priced, they dog will not expel as much due to its nutrient content, the dog will not have to eat as much, and it is convenient to purchase at places like Petsmart.

Although, this is not an AKC recognized (or any "KC" recognized) breed.|`|AA11992723	i think depends on your definition of biggest. Like i know irish wolfhounds are the tallest, but  english mastiff weighs the most.
pvgwJwxvaa	you need to ask your vet.  the hacking is not from the dewormer or vaccines.|`|9MjaiYj4aa	Maybe a day or two|`|AA10500537	call your vet that doesnt sound normal
oDVx7nSxaa	Tonks can be pointed or solid, so that's a major difference in appearance.  And how vocal they are depends on their breeding.  I know a breeder (champion blue tonks!) who's cats can match any Siamese I've ever known for chattiness and howling.  Others are quieter.  It's tough to make generalizations like that - it really depends on the breeding.   If you'd like that Siamese personality without the noise, then contact some tonk breeders and ask about their specific lines.|`|wXVFzEfFaa	one starts with an s and one starts with a t      duh.|`|3SI1j74saa	The names|`|sgaVCFY6aa	they are a cross breed between siamese and burmese check wicopedia|`|bwjf8D31aa	they both are hideous , skinny , obnoxious, slanty-eyed and they end in 'ESE'|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Tonks are a newer breed, a cross between the Siamese and Burmese cats. Tonkinese are often stockier side and have the talkative personality of the Siamese, but without the "in your face-ness" of the breed. They're gorgeous cats!
YXXypzQuaa	My pup ate waayyy to fast too. I bought a special dish for him, and it helped soo much, he eats normal now  Here's a link to the type of dish I'm talking about:  http://www.eatslowerpetdishes.com/dogdis...    by the way, you can find these at most pet stores,|`|eLefeZHHaa	try giving her wet food small pieces at a time. sit by her at her bowl and put small chunks in as she eats it, but wait i few seconds between each one. i hope it helps|`|D4kCGlFJaa	Keep doing what you are doing, eventually she will slow down if you keep feeding her with small handfuls one at a time, and maybe wait a little inbetween. You could also try adding water to it to make it a little soupy, this worked for my boxer! Good Luck!! and kudos to adopting!!!!|`|I4vPxh3jaa	there really is not much that you can do. a puppy is always hungry and will gladly eat any food put before it. that is just the way they are. maybe when the dog is older, like way older, she will slow down and not rush as much. but really, eating fast causes no harm. just don't over feed :)|`|HcmylEwXaa	Everything you said you're doing is exactly what I would suggest, I would keep trying to work with her and hopefully when she is older she will slow down. If it's not making her throw up or get an upset tummy it really isn't too big of a problem, but if you're really worried I would ask your Vet or maybe the shelter for some advice.|`|QYMjMwfEaa	You can slow her down by covering/filling the food with warm water right before you give it to her.  This will also help her digest it.   We have 3 boxers that all do the same.|`|Jq9aJ8IMaa	try feeding her a couple times a day rather than just once.I'm glad you are aware of food aggression and are taking steps to avoid it.she might slow down as she grows but eating and drinking fast can cause vomiting and a twisted stomach which isn't good
SbLeCOjZaa	It is not a perfect science, and I agree with you that it is unnatural. People need to realize that death is a part of life; you can not, and your pet can not, live forever. Even if you are able to successfully clone your pet, it isn't going to be the same pet!|`|ZAH7iOTTaa	i dont like it either.  they should stop playing with nature like that.  it is called karma.  it will come back somehow

JREyMH4zaa	nope.. Dogs are not sexually wired like humans are...They don't look at us as sex partners or  even other dogs unless there's a female in heat. Then it's pure instinct that kicks in.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	No|`|Rva0ocMOaa	No.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	eww...No. I guess the only ones that get turned on are the humans, dogs dont understand " getting turned on" like humans do.|`|tAMkjOjSaa	a dog will get aroused by a woman with her period.....and if permitted will leg hump her|`|pGacaRuFaa	Dogs will dominance hump a human, but they don't view humans as actual mating partners. Some dogs will get a bit strange around a menstruating woman, but it isn't common. Humans tend to be freakish about sex, and tend to attribute things to animals that they are guilty of themselves.|`|0osdNjxhaa	As gross as it sounds it is true. Dogs can enjoy a human's scent. Or maybe just the way you act around a dog. Also all dogs like that smell.|`|XuxZPdNdaa	male dogs are naturally horny, that's why we associate boys with dogs.  The scent a human releases attracts the dog, which in turn heightens his hormones and gets him horny.
NBfBKI1Uaa	The average life span of any fish (or any animal) will depend on the species (or type) of fishes.    Koi can live up to and over 100 years while most tetras have only a life span of few years.    -rds|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Some fish. Goldfish are one that's been documented to live that long.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	With the proper care and environment yes, some fish can live that long.=|`|WebaFPgsaa	Depending on the fish and how well it is taken care of.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It all depends on the fish species.  Some fish (such as the annual killifishes) are over the hill at one year of age, while others (such as sturgeons) can live for over 100 years. Goldfish can live for at least 30 or 40 years, and their relatives, koi, have been known to live for around 200 years in one documented case. The longest-lived fish I have personally kept were some silver dollars (Metynnis hypsauchen) that I had for well over 15 years. In that time, they got to be about eight inches in diameter (they are disk-shaped) and spawned a couple of times.|`|OsVswissaa	Depends on the fish, goldfish and koi can live that long.  As a general rule, large species of fish live longer.|`|q0vKbocHaa	many fish live taht long...Tuna for example can live up to 80 years if they weren't hunted|`|b63d662fc25184c8badfb9e375cec8e9aa	My gold fish lived 27 years.

Including a Jellyfish which is immortal, recently written about in the press.  It reverts to its juvenile form and can indefinitely cycle between youth and maturity.    It is all dependent on species though, a Betta, or Siamese fighter would rarely live more than 18 months.|`|oSyHmMwOaa	Fishes like koi can live longer.
y7igESfUaa	You need to show her that the litterbox is the place to do that. If she does go in the bathtub (or wherever it may be), pick up the droppings and place them in the litterbox. If you catch her in the act, pick her up and place her in the litterbox. Both of these instances will help her to see that the litterbox is the place to do her business.    Perhaps try a new litter? Maybe she doesn't like the current litter you're using. Another alternative, is a product called "Litter Attractant". This is a powder-like substance that you can sprinkle over her current litter that is supposed to attract her to go in that spot.    Please, try not to repremand her for going somewhere else. Cats don't understand a flick on the nose, a shout, or showing her what she has done. All that will do is confuse her. Instead, again, try placing her dropping in the box and place her in it as well. The key is time and patience. Try not to get too angry if she does go somewhere else. Also, grab a spot remover from a local pet store, a good brand is "Nature's Miracle for Cats". This will elimate any scents that will be given off from the area that she went so she will not want to go there again.    One more thing, sometimes the cause of going somewhere other than the litterbox is an underlying health problem. I don't want to scare you, but if she continues to not use her litterbox when you've tried various suggestions, you might want to bring her to the vet to have her checked out.    Good luck to you and your kitty! :]|`|ppoD3p2Saa	because it should'nt be there.|`|HkMFOtpBaa	Lol! My cat has done that to me before to. What it is, is the bathtub is the next best thing to a cat besides a litter box or outside. There are many different reasons why she could be doing this. Eiather the litter box is not clean enough to her likeing (not that it is really gross or anything but sometimes cats get picky) , if you cleaned it recently with a cleaner or something or switched litter type she may not like the smell, she is attracted to a smell in the tub, or she is just trying to get your attention.|`|D8yUwIJJaa	My cat did this too.  Later we found out that she had bladder problems.  The vet said cats will go potty outside of their box if they have health problems they are trying to alert you to.  Have your cat health checked.|`|AA11305262	my cat used to pee in the bathtub and i didn't know what to do... it stopped immediately when i caught him in action and lifted him up - he saw himself peeing and maybe he was embarrassed or something...|`|VMY7No0eaa	put another litter box there.  be greateful it isn't on your carpet.    take to the vet and get an exam she might have a slight uti infection.  good luck|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Keep your bathroom door shut and take her to the vet.

smhsKWAmaa	This is indeed a good idea.  I think the tank should be able to handle the bioload.  Start with the danios, some people dont agree with putting corys in a 10 gallon though, as they like to swim alot, but imo is should be alright. If you can look in to pygmy corys, they only get to about an inch and may go better in a 10 gallon.     Also if you wanted you could add the danios now untll you can find a home for the cae, then when you find a home for it, the tank may be cycled enough for the cories.      I am currently running a set up similar to this, with a betta and 6 harlequin rasboars. and about 50 snails O__O    hope this helps|`|YWlSB3esaa	no, first of all zebra danios dont get along with bettas very well, and those ghost shrimps are going to get eaten when ur betta reaches full grown size, and yes remove the chinese algae eater because they need to school and are chinese, about the corys, yes, they will get along with ur betta really well, but thats it.    so u would be having  1 betta  3 corys  and i wouldnt put zebra danios because when they get older they like to nip long flowing fins like the betta has.    and yes it willl be way too much bio load with 3 corys, 1 betta, 3 zebra danios, 3 ghost shrimps, especially if u have a thin layer of gravel and just 1 filter
kWwgWSSgaa	Morbid? No. Heartbreaking? Yes.    In 2007, two of my Dobermanns had to be put to sleep. In February Boris was pts because of multiple tumours, complicated by DCM. I opted for individual cremation, which was more expensive & a wooden box with a name plate.     In November 2007 Becky died suddenly of DCM. Again I opted for individual cremation & wooden box with a name plate. It's indescribably hard when you have known a living dog & are handed back a box, which is all that it left of them.......    I haven't yet scattered their ashes, I will someday when I'm permanently settled.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	technically ( here in the US anyway) it's illegal to bury any of your animals in your back yard. but heck people do it anyway lol. my dog ( my families dog but i picked him out and grew up with him) he is an 8 year old Akita. he truly is the best dog ever. the kids climb all over him and he just takes it. he listens to everything but he is also protective. Once my fiance's friend was staying with us for a while in our basement. he came home late and my dog didn't know who he was and he cornered him until my fiance came out to check things out. it scared the bajesus out of his friend and his friend's girlfriend but i was glad:) anyway, my step-mom was thinking about a taxidermy. but that's way too weird especially on a 100 pound dog. cremation will do just fine|`|AA10229248	Yes, it's something all responsible pet parents have to consider. My last two dogs were both euthanized when they got to the point where their quality of life was no longer there. I basically just called the vet and said "Today's the day" and they had me bring them in. Both dogs were cremated and I paid extra to have their ashes returned to me. Both of them are now on my mantle with pictures of how they looked n their younger days when they were healthy and vibrant.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	No I cant even think about that when the time comes, my dogs are super attached to me, I think I would be sad for the rest of my life.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I always cremate my dogs so that I can have them with me if I moved or something.  When I die, I will be cremated & all of our ashes spread out together.|`|AA10029366	All of my guys are cremated. In the past, we've sprinkled their ashes in the garden.    My mother keeps the ashes of her dogs, all combined, in a large, beautiful earthware urn.    I usually can't bear to deal with the ashes, nor do I want to mix them with each other, so many of mine are still in their little cedar boxes from the cremation service. I don't want to spread all of the dog's ashes; I'd like to keep some of them. But I can't decide how to do that. So they stay in their boxes, in my dresser.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	not morbid at all. we don't own our own home so they all get cremated. when i get their ashes back they sit on a shelf with my father in law, surrounded by assorted pictures. Dad loved dogs as much as we do and we know he's happy with the dogs around him. Timber, Isis and Bandit sit with him now.  |`|JREyMH4zaa	since I live on a farm that's been in my family for 3 generations, and not ever thinking of selling, my dogs will be buried in the Family pet cemetery along with a long line of other pets dating back to 1893.|`|UbNOv4a1aa	i havent thought about the burial of my current pets seeing as they are still alive and well. i would guess that they will be burried in my backyard.     u know u could always go to one of those pet graveyards. i think it would cost about as much as a cremenation.|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	Yes.  I have a plan for my dogs.    For years our dogs have been cremated and buried at my grandparents home in WI.  The home has been in our family for 20 years and all our dogs (grandparents dogs, aunt/uncle's dogs, my parent's dogs and one day my dogs) have all been buried there.    I feel it is a safe option because we have all agreed that this house will be in our family generations and the dogs all LOVE going to grandma's cabin.|`|sNDQCpZsaa	My favorite dog, Cleo, died when I was seven, and I'm still not over it. Luckily, the veterinarian cremated her, and put her in a locked mahogany box. That may sound kind of creepy, but it's much weirder to bury a dog, to think of throwing dirt on a loved one. She's in my room, watching over me, and every place we move, I take her with me. :]|`|Mcf33eLbaa	For me anyway being a breeder and always having multiple dogs I personally don`t want to turn my property into a pet cemetery.  I am of the thought that the dogs spirit moves on.  What I do is name stars, constellation's after my passed dogs this way I can talk to them when ever I want.  I would not consider your thoughts on this morbid at all as we all keep our loved ones close to our hearts the way we chose.  Good Luck and God Bless|`|s76aC4G8aa	I hate to even think about it, but I will have my dog cremated and keep her ashes in an URN that I can take with me if I should ever move again.    My dying wishes are that if I should die before my dog that she is to be euthanized and put in my casket with me regardless of her health...lol j/k but I'd like to be buried with her so if she's in an urn then my wish is that her ashes be placed with me in my casket.    Boy this is morbid..lol|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Actually, I'm a dog lover and we have a VERY loved Pit Bull(3.5yrs old) and I've wondered the same thing. We happen to be farmers and will most likely bury him on the farm when he dies.|`|58f05f62994facb3fbb61e69121283c1aa	I had 2 yellow labs, one was 12 years and the other 10 years. The younger of the two, my favorite dog, had a soccer ball size tumor in his stomach.  The vet only gave him six months to live. Considering this we made the choice to have him cremated. Even though we loved him dearly, we couldn't stand the thought of burying him in the yard and having to move and have him in the yard with another family.  Also, it would have made it worse to see that constant reminder in the yard. Never the less, he live a whole year after his diagnosis. Soon after that year passed he wasn't able to sit down. We took him to the vet and had him put down and had him cremated with the other pets that were there. Sadly, our other dog waited by the door for him to come back and became very lethargic and ill and we put her down that same week. In retrospect, I wish we had put them down together, since they had been together for 10 years. It is extremely hard when you have to put down a pet, who is more like an actual member of your family, but just like humans, we cant make them suffer.  I believe that your pet can still be around after they pass. Not a day passes where I don't think about those two dogs and how much love and happiness they brought to my family and friends.    I hope that you are able to make the best choice. Make sure that you consider the entire family in the decision.|`|NMpkB50Laa	I was once a Pet Funeral Coordinator, part of my position was to come up with ideas for how my customers would want to keep their pets remains after cremation.    One of my ideas was to have a sandstone type of rock hollowed in the middle so that I  could inter the pets ashes.  I also placed a small plaque on the front of the rock with the pets details.  I then advised my customers that it would be nice to place the Dog Rock in a part of their garden where their best friend had spent a great part of their life and make it a special place where they can sit and reflect on the happy memories their best friend gave them.    With this option if you were to move then you can take your Dog Rock and your pet will be with you forever.|`|RxHFYKqtaa	I had always buried my pets on our farm. Then four years ago, we chose to move - so I can no longer visit their resting place. This helped me in making the decision that my 14 year old Siberian will be cremated.     When I go, I will also be cremated and his ashed will be mixed with mine. After all, he was my boy and while my adult children love him, they have no desire to have his ashes.

AA11992723	kibble is WAY more processed than table scraps! homemade diets or raw food diets are healthier for dogs if you balance their nutrient requirements, than dog food is. you can start feeding either one to a 6 week old puppy even. but random table scraps, first they should never be fed at the table. this will teach a dog to beg and annoy you whenever you eat at the table, as well as any guests you have. second, they just can't be thrown random food if they have never tried it before, this can make them sick from diarrhea to making them prone to pancreaititis. Give only small amounts of anything new you feed at first.    good table food: Meat, raw bones (never cooked bones), cooked vegetables.    bad table food: pastas, breads, corn, sweets.    make sure you look up what foods are poisonous to dogs like grapes and some nuts.    table/people food add benefits like probiotics and phytochemicals to a dogs diet, and are much healthier treats than any dog biscuit you buy at the grocery.    i give my dogs sweet potatoe treats and peanut butter treats that i make. it's cheaper than dog biscuits and healthier. all the sweet potatoe treats are, i buy yams, wash their skins, then cut into thin slices. then i dehydrate them naturally. my dogs love them. peanut butter treats i make with all natural pb, flour and milk. cook at 250F for 20 mins and done. no articifial dyes or preservatives, NO risk for salimeno poison or other contamination, no fillers, cheaper, and they love them.    oops. sorry for the long answer. i always try my best to answer good though.    short answer is:  at any age as long as any new food is slowly introduced in small amounts to prevent diarrhea and other GI irritations.|`|PM23RDycaa	No table scraps you will only teach her to beg and to table and counter surf. Table scraps are unhealthy for a dog.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	You should NEVER feed your dog table scraps! Their bodies can't handle the kind of processed foods we eat.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I'd say about thirty two.  Otherwise they will beg shamelessly at table, and get stomachaches and bad breath, not to mention be poorly served nutrionally.|`|UHv71AN5aa	I would say wait till your dog is 300 years old, then you can feed him table scraps.   When you go to a store look for an aisle that has pet supplies, on that aisle you will see many bags that say DOG FOOD. That is what they eat it and is made for them people have people food and dogs have DOG FOOD. Never, never feed your dog any type of table scraps.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	1 million years old.    You should never feed a dog table scraps! It can be very bad for them, and it will teach your dog to beg at the table and steal food. Don't do it.|`|rk7sN9Ryaa	No matter how old your dog is, you should never feed it table scraps.  It's not only unhealthy for the dog, they begin to develop bad habits such as begging.|`|RpwsJGY3aa	you'll save yourself alot of grief if you never feed her scraps. buy a good dry dog food (ex:iams) and she won't get fat, develop health problems or beg all the time.|`|s76aC4G8aa	It's probably best you don't feed table scraps.  Human food is never good for dogs, it messes up the delicate balance of bacteria dogs have in their stomach and intestines, human food messes that up causing diarrhea and even vomiting.  Human food is harder for dogs to digest and it is also higher in fat and can cause obesity.  Feeding table scraps or human food will make your dog a beggar.    It's always best to not feed human food, but if you must wait until he's no less than 6 months old just to be on the safe side.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It's not good to feed table scraps to dogs.  They can process the foods we eat, they just might end up with an upset stomach or runny poop.  Some dogs handle table scraps fine.  Some end up living off of it because the owners don't buy dog food.  Personally I wish I'd never given our dogs scraps at all.  Now they sit and wait for you to get done eating to see if they are going to get some. Funny, but not really.    Usually we just give them some bread, baked meats (no fat), or some strips of fat (for coat shine).  They don't get enough to make them sick in any way.  They are Labs...labs eat just about anything.  They get good quality Nutro Large breed dog food in the morning with a dog biscuit.  In the evening they get another dog biscuit before bed.  Between the two they might get something from us....usually not much anymore since we have to conserve food & money. :)|`|3hyrFAeCaa	she just asked a question she didn't want a lecture.  If the dog can eat hard food he can eat scraps.  just watch what kind of scraps u give him.|`|iTZHWx5Vaa	I cannot believe that many people here on Y!A do not realize that kibble is not always healthy.  There is actually something called the BARF (Biologically Appropriate Raw Feeding) diet where a dog is fed raw meat and bones.  It is more species appropriate. And you can put table scraps in their bowls very early in life.  Don't feed scraps straight from the table though.
ur5wDhkMaa	Assuming the filter is working then something is leeching alkali's into the tank. Take out everything other than heater, filter and fish, then there's nothing to alter the PH.    You can rule out the tap water because it wouldn't rise again after the PH fixer until you next did a water change. Making the PH yo yo is extremely stressful to fish.    Nitrates come out of the tap, nitrites are the result of ammonia being broken down by bacteria.    Place what you have removed from the tank into different containers of fresh water. Test the PH of that water before adding the item and again 24 hours later. Hopefully that will identify the cause.    Change your filter medium a week from now, ideally in two stages as you have to presume the carbon is saturated from whatever the problem is.|`|GzONMbukaa	naw lil shawty... all i got to say is you need to study alot more in use your brain to figure out|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	have you had your tap water tested???    my tap is the opposite, very acidic.       normally, i don't condone using this, but they sell bottles water just for bettas, try that for a few weeks.    in the mean time, get your tap tested, and consider what substrate you are using, and if you have any rocks, what those are. some(like arogonite) keep the ph up, its what i have to use, cause i have acidic water|`|6L0tVhn7aa	The rocks not white and chalky is it? Tuffa rock gets sold in lots of LFS and these will dissolve in lower ph, this acts as a water hardener as dissolved lime buffers up your ph|`|YnCUyvK7aa	What are the new rocks?  If they're crushed coral or aragonite these are meant for saltwater and cichlid tanks for the purpose of raising the pH.  Also, do you have any seashells in the tank?    A certain and easy way to see if these are the problem is to take a few pieces out and put them on a saucer and drip a little vinegar on them.  If they fizz, then that's the cause.  Vinegar is a mild acid, and the bubbling shows a reaction to a carbonate base.  These slowly dissolve in water raising both the pH and the hardness.  If it's any of your decor, just remove it and replace it with something made for a freshwater tank.  Do a few partial water changes to bring the pH down slowly, you don't want a large change in too small of a time.    ADDED You posted the last comment as I was writing my answer.  Yes the rocks could still be the problem, especially if someone just painted the crushed coral.  Try the vinegar and it'll let you know if they're the cause.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Too add to what marcus said also take some vinegar and put a couple drops on the rocks. If it fizzes and bubbles then its not the kinda rock you want to use and that's whats causing your problem.      Good Luck
IuYekkPVaa	As you say that no urine is being released, it sounds like she's doing what is referred to as "feather dancing". When a cat is especially happy to see their owner, they shake/vibrate their upright tail and often pull their tail down towards their back. You might also notice that whilst shaking their tail, some of them do a treading/dancing motion with their back feet. If this sounds like what your cat is doing - take it as a compliment, because it means she's so happy to see you that she's overcome with emotion.     You can read more about this and other cat body language on the Messybeast web site.    http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk2.htm|`|AA11457471	If she's not spraying urine (oh yes, S/N cats can still spray if they choose!) that's not what it is.  It's probably just one of those quirky things cats do. I have one that chases shadows :0    Add: Read the question, folks- the cat's spayed!|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	She might be simulating the act of spraying. I have a neutered male cat and he's done this for a while. Nothing ever comes out so I'm not too worried about it. It doesn't sound like your cat is straining or peeing where she shouldn't. Cats just do funny things sometimes.|`|zpwJR60baa	Most likely, no. Especially if you take some precautions as a responsible pet owner.     Thoroughly clean any areas that were marked previously. Never use ammonia to clean up cat urine as it will cause the cat to continue to mark the area as ammonia smells like cat pee to a cat.    If your cat is indoors and using a litterbox, keep the box clean. If the litterbox is cascading with previous urine and feces, the cat won't want to continue using a filthy toilet any more than you would if your toilet was over flowing with the same.    Cats are fastidious creatures and appreciate litter that is clean, scooped regularly and changed often.    If you fix your kitty she is most likely to become more attentive to you and a better companion.     Hope this help!|`|08W7YJsIaa	Yes, she most certainly can be marking her territory!  Contrary to popular belief, BOTH male and female cats can spray and mark with their urine. Urine marking is frequently done by whole males and whole females to attract a mate.  If your cat sees a visiting outdoor cat through the window, he may spray on the window sills or even on the curtains to the window. Sometimes, a cat will urinate on anything new that comes in to the home, such as suitcases, shopping bags, etc., that have a new smell. Cats who are highly territorial may feel the need to mark this new smell with their own smell.    If you have a cat that is already fixed yet is still spraying, this may be a sign of the cat feeling overcrowded (especially in a multi-cat home), and/or having an aggressive behavior towards other cats. Even if all your cats seemingly get along well together, it is important to remember that spraying and marking are done very deliberately by cats, and ALWAYS for a very specific reason - they are trying to communicate that something is wrong (from THEIR perspective).
NUIrBHXgaa	Yes i have seen orange bettas before there not very common tho.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	I've seen some reddish-orange bettas and people are creating all sorts of unique color combinations all the time.

And you will most likely not see he much. You really need to make sure that you have enough heated spots in an enclosure like that. You may just want to pick up a 10 or 20 gallon tank. It will be better.|`|xn0yM5VYaa	Too big.|`|QNdpLJmfaa	A little big just put a couple of water dishes in and make sure you remove her to eat shell be fine|`|6j9EZXGWaa	That is a little too big for now.

7L0PFTXKaa	First, before you consider getting a Harris' Hawk, you should look into the world of Falconry--    North American Falconry and Hunting Hawks is fantastic, even for falconers in the United Kingdoms.  Falconry and Hawking is another great book, published by a UK author.    Falconry Equipment is also a nice book, which can help you calculate costs and set up the demensions for your hawk house.    Best of luck--  --Phoenix
Oxdkporsaa	Decreased appetite is usually one of the earliest signs that your ***** might be pregnant. Not all females go through this doggie version of "morning sickness", but a small percentage will eat less during the first few weeks of gestation, usually making up for it later in the pregnancy.   A sudden decrease in activity can indicate that your ***** is pregnant. Just like some women, canines may also experience feelings of exhaustion as their hormone levels change to support embryo production.   Nipple growth is a good indicator that your *****'s body is going through pregnancy changes. The nipples of an unbred female are usually quite small, and the area immediately beneath them will feel flat. However, once a pregnancy is in progress, breast material will develop beneath the nipples, which will also increase slightly in preparation for eventual milk production.   Behavioral changes may also be noticed, with either an increase in affectionate behavior or an expressed desire to be left alone.   Progressing Signs  As the pregnancy progresses, you will notice further changes.     An increase in appetite is usually noted about three to four weeks into the pregnancy and is especially noticeable if your female slacked off her food after her heat cycle ended.   Weight gain should be noticeable by one month into the pregnancy. The *****'s abdomen will thicken, and gentle examination of the belly will reveal a firm, rather than fat feeling to the area.    The canine gestation period is similar to that of humans, in that its length is flexible. Typically, a dog's pregnancy will last around 63 days from conception to birth (also known as whelping).|`|kbV5LV3paa	Likely she is or will be pregnant.. Make sure to write down the 1st & last day they mated. That way you can estimate the day she'll have her pups. The pregnancy lasts anywhere from 62-65 days. Since you say she's small then she might not show until a month into it. Good luck & watch her closely!|`|k6hZGdr7aa	I have to agree with the person who answered before me.  Although i do encourage you to ask questions, but i would be asking your vet so that you get a direct and correct medical advice.  I would recommend taking your dogs to a vet, asking them all your questions and see what your options are.  If you continue with having the litter, consider having your dog spayed after her pups have been weened but get your male neutered right away so that he doesn't impregnate any other females.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	you may as well be ready, youre going to get ripped wide  open for this question in here...im not going to rip and tear like some of them are...but you dont sound like you have any experience in breeding.....it will on average take 62-65 days from the time they mate to have puppies, but can be as  short as 57 or as long as 68-69 days. just keep a good eye on her...its VERY likely that shes pregnant, its almost guaranteed after 3 days of mating...she wont show too many signs right off, you will eventually notice her belly getting fuller and bigger, she will start eating a little more. when shes a couple weeks or so from birthing, he boobies will start to sag. some sooner,,,some later...depends on the dog...make sure you have her vet checked, and x rayed so you know everyone is healthy and how many there are..and keep a good eye on her, smaller dogs have trouble giving birth alot of times and need emergency c-section to have their puppies, otherwise the dog and puppies can all die.  just be careful. and either get them fixed afterwards, or do A LOT more research at least before breeding again,|`|PM23RDycaa	Why on EARTH are you allowing them to continue to breed when you don't know what you are doing?    Get your female spayed immediately unless you happen to have a couple grand on hand in case she needs a c-section like most small breeds in 9 weeks time.    IF you were a reputable breeder you would know when to look for signs of pregnancy as well as to take your ***** to the VET to have it confirmed. You also wouldn't be letting them mate for 3 days straight.    Get your animals fixed you have no business breeding. It take 4-5 weeks for a female to display pregnancy symptoms if at all. Some don't show any until close to their due date.    ADD: Unless your parents happen to be REPUTABLE breeders and also show their dogs they have do business breeding. Did this thorough checkup at the vet also include:  OFA - for hips and patellas  CERF - For heritable eye diseases?   Optigen testing for progressive retinal atrophy?    These are the MINIMUMS for the Toy poodle    Do your parents know anything about these diseases?    Addison's    Basic Genetics    Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat)    Chronic Active Hepatitis    Cushings    Ear Care    Epilepsy    Hip Dysplasia    Hypothyroidism    Legg-Calve-Perthes    Patellar Luxation    Optic Nerve Hypoplasia    More Eye Health Links    Sebaceous Adenitis (SA)    Von Willebrand's disease (vWD)    It takes more than a vet check up to deem a dog ok to breed|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	If you need to ask these questions, you should have them both fixed immediately.  You shouldn't be allowing them to breed if you don't know what you are doing.    EDIT: Then why didn't you just ask your parents, since they know what they are doing?|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Please fix your dogs. Do not attempt this without extensive research! It is not for amateurs!
dRUgXlOLaa	What is Separation Anxiety?     When you leave the house, it is nice to know that your dog goes to his favorite spot and sleeps peacefully until you return. However, dogs suffering from separation anxiety are not so lucky. Separation anxiety can appear in dogs that have not been properly socialized, dogs that have been moved from one home to another and dogs that are naturally nervous.     Your dog is a social pack animal who relies on others (you) for individual protection and security. Dogs that lack confidence due to socialization issues, understanding of expected behavior, or possible maltreatment in the past (adopted dogs), are more likely to exhibit behaviors related to separation anxiety.    Essentially, when you leave to go to work or even just to the corner store for five minutes, your dog becomes upset, stressed and confused. Dogs with separation anxiety can do everything from whining and barking, to ripping apart your couch and eating your duck feathered pillow.     How do I know if my dog has Separation Anxiety?    There is much debate over the cause of separation anxiety. Some believe it is a lack of confidence that causes the dog to rely to much on their humans. In this case, you have to teach your dog to accept the fact that you are leaving, and it's going to be ok.     If you have a dog with separation anxiety, you will know. Dogs will usually exhibit a combination of the following:     - The behavior often occurs when the dog is left alone.   - The dog makes a big deal when his owner leaves, or comes home.   - When left alone the dog will exhibit behavior which is not common to his normal behavior.   - The dog may not eat if the owner is not in the room   - The dog will follow his owner around constantly     What ever the cause is, here are some techniques for solving the problem.     What can be done?     Make your Departure and Arrival Routine     Make your dog realize that your departures and arrivals are nothing to get excited over. Usually the dog feels the greatest amount of anxiety shortly after you leave. Therefore you need to practice with your dog the routine of coming and going.     Lots of Exercise!     Exercise is believed to relieve stress in both humans and dogs alike. A long walk, run, or play session prior to leaving can go a long way in helping to reduce the stress and anxiety of your dog.     Give Your Dog Something to Do While You Are gone.     If your dog has something entertaining to do while you are away, he will be less likely to become stressed and anxious. A stuffed Kong filled with a tasty treat is an excellent example.     Confine Your Dog While You Are Away     Some dogs are more comfortable being confined to their own den. A crate is an ideal space for your dog. A dog who is properly crate trained is less susceptible to get into trouble while you are gone. If a crate is not an option, confine him to one room or limit access to the whole house.     Introduce Another Dog     If your dog has another companion to keep him company while you're gone, it may help alleviate the boredom and tension caused while you are away. Of course this is only one option. There are many other factors to take into consideration before adding another dog to your home.     Set Aside Time For Your Dog     Make time during your day to give undivided attention to your dog. This time can be spent playing, teaching, or even just taking a nap together. If possible, try to make this one-on-one time prior to departures.     Leave the Radio or TV On     Leave a radio on in a separate room. The dog will hear the voice and will feel less alone. Some people even leave voice recordings of themselves in hopes to calm the dog.     Depending on the severity of anxiety, you may need to contact a behavior specialist through your vet.

Unneutered dogs often cock their legs to leave their scent and that's probably what your dog is doing.|`|AA12128656	no, your dog knows EXACTLY what they are.    keep a leash and a dominant dog collar on him. (NOT a chain or prong, but a nylon slip)  when he even LOOKS like he's going to do it, CORRECT him. make it unpleasant for him to disrespect people like that. and you might also want to keep him away from people a bit.  when you want him to approach someone, have him sit or lay down fir them, and then you or them gives him a treat. he will learn that by respectfully sitting/laying, he'll be rewarded.  he's basically telling all these people that he's better than them.|`|gaXUIduMaa	Carry a newspaper with you and next time he does it, smack him.

Both of you will be  happier for that.|`|csvGd6DHaa	Don't "smack the crap out of him" your dog will likely become scared of you.Also If someone comes up to pet the dog alert them before he lift his leg.Or yell no.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	That is a very disrespectful habit. What, does your dog think he should own everything?  What you need todo, is, the minute you see him lifting his leg to mark someone, you go over there, and give him a ferm touch on the neck, it doesnt matter if you just dont want the other person to find out. The only way for you to fix this problem is to correct your dog in the act. I seriously cannot believe your dog marks people
QQMGBoi1aa	Your question is a bit vague and I am not sure this is the answer you are looking for.    It is a known fact that dogs rescues or not, have a calming effect.  People who are ill often become depressed and dogs often lift their spirits.  One of my rescues is a Certified Therapy Pet and we take him to the childrens hospital to visit terminally ill patients.  It is so rewarding to see the childrens faces light up when he enters the room!    Hope this helps.

For instance, I have Ginger, who is a Rat Terrier... She cuddles up next to me and love a belly rub. She loves to sleep with me, especially on these chilly nights! She'll get feisty and play, etc... And, for those movies that my husband just can't stand, she'll cuddle next to me on the couch and even rest on my shoulders.

When a dog loves you it is an unconditional love and you can't help but love them back.  Many people never get that kind of love elsewhere or they don't feel free to express it.    Also, I think rescued dogs as compared to dogs who have been in the same home all their life have something else.  A dog you raise from a puppy has a good life if you treat it good.  But it never knows any different.  Given a chance he will run to explore different places.      A rescued dog appreciates you more because he feels that there are other places less desirable.  Even if you keep that dog for a long time, some little part makes him afraid of going back.  So he does his best to please you.     A lot of people only want to rescue puppies or young dogs.  You may have heard the expression "a dog appreciates a second chance".  When you adopt an older dog I don't know how they know but they know its their last chance.  They love you ten times as much.

oDVx7nSxaa	Generally it's good to take a cat to the vet (*your* vet) within a few days of adopting them, for an exam.  Many shelters will spay/neuter, but not really give a good vet exam.  After that, they should go in for a yearly checkup (just like humans) and if they become ill.|`|wBit6g5Xaa	I'd say about once a year.|`|y7igESfUaa	On average, for your normal, healthy cat, once a year is sufficient. After the first rabies shot (which, I'm guessing your little on has gotten), she will get her second in a year. The second one, however, will last for the next three years. There are usually vaccinations in between, though. A yearly checkup is always a good idea, whether she needs any shots or wormings or not. Good luck with your new addition. :]|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	My Vet sends me a reminder for them to go in for annual booster injections and an "MOT" when she checks their teeth, anal glands, eyes, ears, paws, spine and abdomen.

AQsiugSpaa	Sky Baby,    Spaying and declawing are nothing similar. Spaying prevents unwanted litters, and also prevents major illnesses which can result if a female is permitted to go into heat repeatedly, on and on.    Cats purr, not only when feeling pleasure, they purr when they are in pain. It is their way of giving themselves endorphins to help alleviate suffering. Cats purr when close to death, as well.    I do hope that yoou will never declaw another cat again, now that you are learning more about it.    Here is my personal opinion on declawing, by the way:    I don't understand why people still declaw their cats. It is banned in many countries around the world, thankfully. Maybe the US will get on board, if some vets decided this was not a humane way to make money.    Not only is it a cruel and inhumane surgery, with recovery that is painful and can result in disfiguring side effects if not done perfectly, cats need their claws.  Even indoor cats can escape out the front door, so are vulnerable to attacks from other animals, so without claws they are defenseless.     I adopted a cat that had been declawed prior to our adopting her. While she could not scratch furniture, she had developed a habit of chewing on everything, leaving little toothmarks in lampshades, window shades and other items in our home. I think that "scratching" behavior that remains must be rather frustrating for them. She also chewed on nylon, and wool, which may or may have been related to the declawing.    If it is your furniture that you are concerned about, cats can be trained to leave it alone. If provided with the necessary scratching devices, high enough or long enough for them to stretch out completely, and if patient and consistent work with the cat is done, all cats can eventually learn to leave furniture alone.     My couches and carpets are in pristine shape and we have two very active outgoing cats, with all claws intact. They do their "work" on their scratching posts and other devices for that purpose, liberally placed around the house.    Claws are not just used for climbing, "they are used are used for balance, for exercising, and for stretching the muscles in their legs, back, shoulders, and paws" Cats need their claws for many things.    http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...    If people don't know how to trim nails, their vet or vet assistant can teach them. It is not difficult. Doing every two weeks helps prevent accidental tears, as well.  The humane products, Softclaws, can be an alternative if clipping nails is out of the question, as well.    Kitties that are bored tend to be more interested in furniture, but  if one gives them a stimulating environment  with lots of toys with which to play, spending time each day doing interactive play will keep them happy and more "kitten like".

I have indoor cats and they are declawed in the front. They have no problems with their feet, grab things with their toes like regular cats, and have never been painful.     I feel declawing has an appropriate place, and that place is with cats that will only live indoors and be cared for. I don't really think that an older cat should be declawed, but kittens are young and haven't become fully accustomed to everything yet. However, if it's between an older cat that's perfectly healthy being declawed and having a home or being put to sleep, then I will agree with a declaw.    I also feel that there are better ways to do declaws. I haven't any personal experience with the laser surgery yet, but considering the laser seals the nerve endings I think it'd be a great way to go.    I feel that surgery done carefully with a scalpel blade is acceptable. You can definitely make sure that everything has been removed while you're cutting. This is the method that my veterinarian (my vet meaning that I take my pets to him and also work for him as a veterinary technician) practices and he's never had problems.     I believe that removing the claws by way of a guillotine style nail trimmer is not practicing quality medicine. You have to cut so far back to ensure you get everything that you mangle the pads. If you don't get everything, the claws can grow back. I find that to be unacceptable.    I haven't looked very in depth to the studies around declawing, but the ones I have looked at haven't completely convinced me. I read one about how a cat was thrashing about its cage in pain. I have never seen an animal so in pain that it did that. I have seen animals recovering from anesthesia thrash around in what's known as "stage 2" but that had nothing to do with pain and everything to do with what drugs were used and how easily the animal went into anesthesia. I've read about cats becoming biters and I have had so many declawed cats try to scratch me with what's not there. Just because they don't have claws does not mean they will now turn into biters. I've also heard about various paw problems and I feel that's due to the medical care and after care the cat has received.     If quality medicine is practiced, I don't think a cat will experience these sort of problems. I feel there's a time and a place and that there are some exceptions. I think a four-paw declaw is overkill and wouldn't dream of it, however, there are exceptions (those who are immune-compromised and cannot afford to be scratched by dirty kitty feet, which is an exception in countries where declawing is banned).    I'm sure people have brought up various alternatives to declawing. I feel that if someone wants the actual claws gone, then they don't want to deal with trimming them or gluing things to their cat's feet. More modern vets seem to offer a tendonectomy where they will sever the tendon that allows the cat to extend its claws, keeping the claws permanently detracted. Because the cat can't sharpen it's calws anymore, the nails continue to grow and need routine cutting. A lot of people who elect to have this procedure performed on their cat assume that they no longer have to worry about the claws and then cat has overgrown claws that cause discomfort when walking.     Another option are those cute little nail caps. I really haven't heard anybody say anything satisfactory about them. They need continual reapplying and don't last as long as the package states. For somebody that doesn't want to deal with the claws, high maintenance doesn't seem to be the way to go.    Many people will jump over this and say that if somebody is not willing to put up a natural anatomic structure on an animal's body then they should not own a cat and are bad cat owners for encouraging declawing. How many cats would never have had homes because of such an attitude? Many veterinarians will agree that they would rather declaw a healthy cat and give it a chance at an otherwise happy, healthy, and caring home than put it to sleep.|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Then what happens if the cat manages to get out?

The operation itself is the most painful a cat can go through,painkillers only dull the agony, they suffer for 2 whole days, and can you imagine the shock and bewilderment a cat feels when such very essential parts of them has gone ? Even indoor cats need their claws, to groom, to play, to walk,to stretch their muscles, there is no more pitiful sight than a declawed cat trying to do the things cats do ! People may say their cat is OK, but they don't know that, cats hide their pain, they have no choice but to adjust and go on, but they are never cats again, they are cripples !! There is so much information about declawing on the internet, look at pictures, read it up, then help spread the word that it's a mutilation. In countries where it's banned it's classed as animal abuse. Vets who do it in countries where it isn't banned, do it for the money.Would you trust your cats to a person like that ? I wouldn't. I heard recently about a cat who bled to death after declawing and one who lost her back feet due to a botched job, would you ever forgive yourself if that happened to your cat ?   No , its not totally fine, its totally cruel.Please if you truly love cats,don't do it any more !|`|G032Flc3aa	Out of your own mouth you have said it's totally inhuman to declaw outdoor cats! So what is the difference then...do you think indoor cats don't need to groom, play, and stretch? And do you think there isn't the slightest chance that they will one day escape their incarceration and be in danger outdoors?  And if it's so totally fine why don't you get yourself away to the nearest hospital and have the ends of your fingers and toes removed, get up and walk straight away, dig in a box of rough cat litter and only take painkillers for a couple of days, you'll get a taste of what you've put your cats through. PAIN!  My heart breaks for those three poor cats in your power, I could no more deliberately cripple/disable/betray my beloved cats than I could harm any other animal or human.    You should hang your ignorant head in shame!|`|R2aTEi9Kaa	Since you are 17 and you didn't have much of a choice as your parents had all of your cats declawed I won't come down to hard on you, but what I will do is explain to you my own opinion.    First of all I am 300% AGAINST this surgery, Declawing should be called detoeing, the vet performs 10 radical amputations of the cats does down the the first knuckle, I will post links in the source box that will show you pictures of exactly how much is taken.     A cats claw is not like a human nail it is a complex structure that rather then grow out of a nail bed it grows directly out of BONE. In order to remove the claws the entire first knuckle bone must be completely removed. The vet also severs four vital tendons that permanently prevent the cat from EVER stretching what's left of its mutilated toes.     If you want an accurate comparison of what they area taking from the cat in human standards, a cats foot is more like a human hand and when they declaw them it is equivalent to removing your fingers down to the first knuckle OR it is equivalent to cutting off HALF of your foot.    This surgery is excruciating for ALL cats, aren't you aware that cats purr not only when they are happy but also when they're in pain to soothe themselves and to spread endorphins to try and limit the pain. This is the MOST painful of all vet performed surgeries, it's the one they test pain killers for animals on. When cats wake up from this surgery they are in so much pain they are usually screaming and bashing their heads against the cages.    What you need to understand is that the fact they they'd be defenseless outside is the least inhumane part of it, are you aware that cats WALK on their toes? When you declaw them you are amputating those toes, which completely changes the way the cat walks. They have to change the way they stand, which changes the alignment of their spine, which causes arthritis, back and hip pain, and joint and muscle stiffness throughout the cats body.    There is also the fact that cats stretch all of their muscles by digging in their front claws and pulling back, when you remove their claws they are NO longer physically able to stretch any of their muscles properly which also leads to arthritis, muscle spasms, joint stiffness, joint and back pain and a whole host of other things.    This surgery also often makes cats very untrusting of humans, bitter, angry and hurt.    NOW...Let me ask you this...Why did your parents have them declawed???     There are NO, benefits for the cat at all, this surgery is done solely to benefit HUMANS and apparently to benefit furniture.     I mean tell me what benefit amputation has on the cats????    Cat's scratch for three main reasons  1) A cats claw is like an onion , made up of layers, and the scratch to shed the outer most layer otherwise it will get sore and infected. It is up to YOU to provide them adequate scratching surfaces.    2) They have scent glands on the pads of their feet and they scratch to scent mark.    3) As I stated earlier they scratch to stretch their muscles.    Now to explain about Spay/Neuter, this is totally different, spay neuter has many benefits to the CAT, first of all it prevents about twenty kinds of cancer, second of all it prevents pregnancy that will add to the over populaton problem, third of all it prevents pyometra in females (a fatal uterine infection). Fourth of all heat cycles are very painful for the cat and fifth of all it prevents them from trying to escape all the time risking death by cars, dogs, coyotes, other cats, poisons, dog fighters, etc...    The biggest difference though is this, Cats have no idea what a testical or a uterus is, when those things are removed they no idea that anything is even gone, recovery is at most a week, pain is actually quite minimal and it doesn't affect them psychologically.    Cats ARE however completely aware of their claws and they know what has been taken when they are declawed.    Cats come with claws, if you can't accept that, then don't get a cat.  To mutilate any animal for our own selfish reasons is disgusting and unnacceptable.    Please don't mutilate any other cats.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	The difference between declawing and spaying is that one is a mutilation of an animal usually because the owner does not have the time/patience/willpower/common sense to deal with the issue, and the other is a surgery performed to reduce the pet over-population in this country and also to avoid unalterable behaviors.      If you have a cat and you don't like them to claw you or the furniture, then you can train it to not do those behaviors.  Cats can be trained not to do things, especially if you provide them with alternatives like scratching posts.  If you cut your cat's nails regularly, then you remove the sharp hook that does all the damage without having to remove the toe. It doesn't even work that well, anyway.  My friend's cat was declawed and learned to pry apart the sofa at the seams with its toes.    Spaying prevents behaviors that a cat cannot be trained out of such as yowling at all hours for a mate, spraying, and generally acting like a dick.  Spaying also has health benefits for the cat: in females, spaying before the first heat reduces the risk of cancer by 90% or some such (look it up on the ASPCA or Humane Society website). Not only that, but spayed cats cannot produce kittens, kittens which are likely to end up homeless, abandoned, and eventually dead if you are not a breeder.  Finally, if you think that a cat with claws is destructive, an unaltered cat would blow your mind.  Cats that are normally calm, indoor felines will bust out windows, scratch all things in sight, ruin your house with urine markings, and invite big, feral tomcats into your house.    One last thing, to the young lady who thinks that declawing cats is more humane that euthanizing: saving a cat's life is for sure better than putting it to sleep, but if a family has such a big problem with the cat's claws that it needs to be declawed, then the cat should be given up for adoptio WITH ITS CLAWS to a home that understands feline behavior.  Often, declawed cats are harder to rehome because they don't do well in places with other pets.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	De-clawing is extremely painful for kitties.  My sister works in a vet clinic and the vet who owns the place will not perform de-clawings. That is enough for me to know that I will never have a cat declawed.     As for the comment about spaying...You are comparing oranges and apples.  One is a completely unecessary surgery that is done purely because of the selfishness of the pet owner.  The other (spaying) has many health benefits to it.      Last year about 17 million dogs and cats were turned over to animal shelters. Only one out of every 10 taken in to the shelters found a home. This means that over 13.5 million had to be destroyed. The tragedy is that this is unnecessary. Much of the problem could be eliminated by simple surgery: Spaying and neutering operations are performed under general anesthesia and are quite painless. By neutering pets, owners can help lower the numbers of unwanted and homeless creatures.|`|BmI2fszPaa	Really? lets amputate the tips of your fingers and see how you'd like it then.

For some reason my chair was the only thing they liked to use.  Yes i tired many different types and what not but none were more interesting than my chair.  So we got them de-clawed, front feet only.  The recovery was fine and they returned to their normal behaviors as soon as they got home.    It seems like a mean thing to do and i respect others opinions on the topic but i feel that if you get it done to them while they are young, the recovery is much easier.  I mean, you are going to have them under for a spay/neuter anyways and they should be getting post-op pain meds and antibiotics for that.  Does not seem to be a cruel procedure if done properly and they are cared for after-wards.|`|ZIVBpYv1aa	there are two types of declawing now. 1) completely taking the claws out. very pain on the cats side and can damage nerves. 2) severing the tendons (or w/e u call them) that allow the cat to take out its claws. not so painful.  i think the second one is okay, the fist not so much.|`|ogkNBkmdaa	If you don't have to declaw...then I would say no.  I have 2 cats and they are declawed, the first one had the nail crushed and then removed (which if not all the nail bed is removed can cause future problems like the nail regrowing under the skin, infected etc...short story = gross/costly/painful for cat) and the 2nd cat had part of her toes amputated. It does change their personality...no matter what other people say about their cat...it does change them...the first cat is more of a bitter now and then there is the issue of outdoor safety and of course trust with the cat. I worry if there is a diaster and one of them gets outside...we've had a couple close calls...in short...if you don't have to declaw then don't. If the goal of declawing is to protect furniture, etc...there are other ways of postively modifying their behavior vs. declaw. Declawing a cat forces the cat to be dependant on another person for the rest of their life...for safety, food, etc...it's not a decision to be quickly made and the effects are huge (especially in the negative..there really isn't a positive except to gratify our own selfish needs).|`|LIeWRtmmaa	I think that anybody who thinks that declawing is fine should have all of their fingtips removed at the first knuckle.  That is what declawing is...it doesn't just remove the claws; but, whole segments of bone from each of their paws.  Cats can be trained not to scratch things inside and their claws actually are of use to them in stretching.  When claws are removed cats can never again fully stretch their backs and this can cause severe pain and discomfort for them.  It can also affect their balance and ability to jump and walk in some cases.  I think this is up the same alley of a neighbor I had growing up...they removed their dog's vocal chords so that their barking wouldn't be so annoying.  Invest the time and energy in your pets to train them.|`|IrCHNSNHaa	I don't care if it's an indoor or outdoor cat, declawing is CRUEL. If you want an animal that doesn't scratch, get a goldfish, cats have claws.  It is not totally fine at all and the vet I take my animals to refuses to perform that particular surgery.      Declawing is not like a manicure. It is serious surgery. Your cat's claw is not a toenail. It is actually closely adhered to the bone. So closely adhered that to remove the claw, the last bone of your the cat's claw has to be removed. Declawing is actually an amputation of the last joint of your cat's "toes". When you envision that, it becomes clear why declawing is not a humane act. It is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery period. And remember that during the time of recuperation from the surgery your cat would still have to use its feet to walk, jump, and scratch in its litter box regardless of the pain it is experiencing. Wheelchairs and bedpans are not an option for a cat.     No cat lover would doubt that cats--whose senses are much keener than ours--suffer pain. They may, however, hide it better. Not only are they proud, they instinctively know that they are at risk when in a weakened position, and by nature will attempt to hide it. But make no mistake. This is not a surgery to be taken lightly.     Your cat's body is perfectly designed to give it the grace, agility and beauty that is unique to felines. Its claws are an important part of this design. Amputating the important part of their anatomy that contains the claws drastically alters the conformation of their feet. The cat is also deprived of its primary means of defense, leaving it prey to predators if it ever escapes to the outdoors.|`|c4dny3nfaa	If you think it's totally fine man , have your finger ends removed and then think again.

Claws aren't only for self defence they are as necessary to a cat as our finger ends are to us,cats need their claws to be cats ! I'm so sad for your 3 who can't enjoy the right to groom and walk and play properly as cats should and who are at risk of developing back problems too.  Catch up with the rest of the world man, where vets don't amputate bits of animals to suit their selfish owners.|`|2O5BPFuSaa	Well if you are going to declaw, leaving the backs is better. If they manage to slip outside though, they are still at a disadvantage if they encounter another animal or need to catch their own food. I wouldn't want to risk it. To keep our cat from scratching up the furniture, we provide a scratching post and trim his claws weekly with a sharp claw trimmer. This is harder at first but they get used to it. You can do it while they are sleeping, or you can give them a toy or treat to be mesmerized with while you clip them. Afterwords they are rewarded with the treat or toy.   When my cat was a kitten it was harder to put up with his tiny daggers. Sometimes I wondered if I should have had this especially stubborn little guy declawed. Now his claws are wider and stay duller longer. He's learned to play nice and at family functions he's defended himself against other pets harming him. He's also gotten out a few times and safely returned. He likes having his claws trimmed too. He knows he gets the toy after.   Someday if we move to the country we may even let him out. He meows and paws at the door every day, insisting he's an outside cat.   For all counts I'm glad he has his claws.|`|huEWXxmLaa	You've obviously read the earlier replies as you've added details, you are 17 and have grown up with declawed cats as a sort of tradition, if you'd said that  people wouldn't have been so hard on you. But now you know the truth, you have the chance to help stop something really bad !! You say your cats purred on the way home from declawing, don't you know cats purr when they are in bad pain ? As well as when they are happy ....You are lucky,or should I say your cats are, to have had no bad effects so far, I just hope they don't develop any  back problems in the future.We are for spaying because it's not a cruel operation,yes the cat is uncomfortable for a day or so but not in dreadful pain as a declawed cat is for 2 whole days and crippled for life.Spaying is a necessary operation as there aren't enough homes for cats and kittens now, without more being born. Unspayed cats can develop womb troubles, they are frustrated coming into heat, and of course spaying isn't banned in enlightened countries, as declawing is.  PLEASE take the opportunity now to help by educating everyone you can about declawing, it will be banned worldwide as soon as we can get that, but meanwhile cat after cat after cat is suffering.|`|c9a470b2327a7dfb6f148bee0f335df7aa	De-clawing is cruel, have parts of your fingers and toes cut off and come tell me that you are "totally fine".      Spaying decreases possibility of certain disease conditions later in life, such as pyometra or infection in the uterus.  Not to mention the problem of over population.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    I don't know about you, but for me, the economic trend today, with jobs disappearing, the expense of 4 cats can be overwhelming at times.    If something happens with your cats, which may necessitate a emergency medical procedure, or just routine care, alone, adds up significantly. With the high cost of vaccines, food and other items, one has to consider strongly if we can keep our "promise" to our cats to take the best care possible. Kittens soon become cats, by the way as you know.     Additionally, I still wonder why in the world people want to declaw their cats. It makes no sense to me at all, and, in fact is banned in many countries throughout the world.    Not only is it a cruel and inhumane surgery, with recovery that is painful and can result in disfiguring side effects if not done perfectly, cats need their claws.  Even indoor cats can escape out the front door, so are vulnerable to attacks from other animals, so without claws they are defenseless.     I adopted a cat that had been declawed prior to our adopting her. While she could not scratch furniture, she had developed a habit of chewing on everything, leaving little toothmarks in lampshades, window shades and other items in our home. I think that "scratching" behavior that remains must be rather frustrating for them. She also chewed on nylon, and wool, which may or may have been related to the declawing.    If it is your furniture that you are concerned about, cats can be trained to leave it alone. If provided with the necessary scratching devices, high enough or long enough for them to stretch out completely, and if patient and consistent work with the cat is done, all cats can eventually learn to leave furniture alone.     My couches and carpets are in pristine shape and we have two very active outgoing cats, with all claws intact. They do their "work" on their scratching posts and other devices for that purpose, liberally placed around the house.    Maybe you are not aware that   "declawing",  is not  just removing the nails, or the extent involved in this surgery. Claws are not just used for climbing, "they are used are used for balance, for exercising, and for stretching the muscles in their legs, back, shoulders, and paws" Cats need their claws for many things.    http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...    If you don't know how to trim nails, your vet or vet assistant can teach you. It is not difficult. Do it every two weeks.    The humane products, Softclaws, can be an alternative if clipping nails is out of the question, as well.    Kitties that are bored tend to be more interested in furniture, but  if you give them a stimulating environment  with lots of toys with which to play, spending time each day doing interactive play will keep them happy and more "kitten like".

I have An African grey parrot, a green cheek conuer, 6 canaries, 12 finch, a cat, a dog, a hamster, and a hedgehog and my other cat just recently passed away:(  I'm planning to get another kitten sometime soon.  Don't worry, I have alot of room in my house and enough time on my hands so they can all be comfortable.  Just as long as you have enough room and time (and maby enough money! lol!) then you can most likely get another cat.  Don't let anyone tell you that you have too many pets!|`|q0vKbocHaa	I would personally say its too much, but as far as owning goes, no that isn't too much. As long as you spay/neuter them then I'm all for it|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	since you are going to hack its little toes off, yes, 4 is too many.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Firstly, I am about to have a rant as a cat lover and cross old lady.  Their front claws are not declawed.  What you have had done is to have them maimed by cutting off their toes at the first joints; did you not know that?  Would you have that done to a child who pulled off some wallpaper?.  This procedure is totally illegal in the UK and other Civilised Countries.  I guess you are in the USA?  To your question - an optimum number of cats is that which it is within the owner's capabilities to house, feed and provide with all necessaries without any of the animals becoming stressed or neglected.  I have had up to six cats because I have fostered for our Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and currently have two who could not be rehomed for physical reasons.  Now in my 70's, these will be my last cats since I am well aware of my own mortality.|`|phAqOpzZaa	i have 8 cats...but now its 7! but...the 8th that was stolen will always be my apart of my family...    so no! thats not too many!|`|sXZWQRGdaa	More than you can adequately take care of would be too much.|`|gU34xa9vaa	You shouldn't have any cats at all if you think declawing them is alright. Please don't subject another kitten to this cruelty,cats come with claws, people who don't like that shouldn't get cats !  Please read up on declawing and why it's banned in so many countries, it affects cats physically and mentally, it's proved too now that it causes many problems for them as well as being the most painful operation you can put a cat through. Prove you really love cats by spreading the word about this and not doing it to any more ! We have had cats for 34 years, 4 the most at a time, NONE declawed.....our friend has 14 cats  NONE declawed, you can't have too many cats if you truly want the best for them,yes have them neutered but never ever declawed.|`|P7VdWn7baa	Its your life your home and your decition. What you decide is fine! who cares what others think. GL :)|`|bwjf8D31aa	why why why???|`|G032Flc3aa	The number of cats you have depends on the space you have, if you can honestly say that each cat has a space to call it's own, a litter tray of it's own, a place to eat in peace and safety and that none of your older cats would bully it then IN THEORY it would be fine to get a kitten    BUT as you are cruel and misinformed enough to think it is acceptable to maim a cat by amputating half of each toe on it's front paws then you and your family shouldn't be allowed to keep cats.      It's as simple as that.|`|c4dny3nfaa	Why do you ask ? I just wonder because you obviously don't know much about cats if you think declawing them is alright. Surely you don't plan to mutilate any more do you man ?   As someone above says, as long as each cat has his/her own space, litter tray, love and attention, you can never have too many cats,but for someone who has them mutilated, well even one single cat is too many.   Is it a family tradition ? If so,show what a good person you are and  break that tradition now and educate the rest of your family too as to how cruel declawing cats really is.|`|huEWXxmLaa	You have 3 cats now and want a kitten, have you not crippled enough cats already ? If after reading all about declawing you realise how cruel it is and how you've wronged your poor cats, Ok, but please don't put another cat through amputation.Did you know it's supposed to be a last resort for serious scratching problems ? Not a routine operation to deprive little kittens of their much needed parts.It's banned in many countries, it's very painful to cats, it causes problems to cats.....the sooner it's banned everywhere the better, and it will be banned !! Then only people who love cats to be cats, with their rightful claws, will have the honour of sharing their homes with the beautiful creatures.|`|MFRWNxdaaa	One|`|jtG41TXZaa	i Personally think The limits of how many cats you should have is 3.|`|KK8zsJz2aa	no, i had 7 cats at one time. but dont declaw them. it degrades thier sense of balance, and its cruel. and as to how many cats are too many,............ infinity and beyond. cat lovers rule!!!!
AA12083992	Gentle exercise while young and increase as he gets older.  Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

Information On Spaying Or Neutering Your Puppy    Despite the obvious and much-documented benefits that come from the spaying and neutering America's dog population, there are those pet owners who still harbor some reservations about the whole process. Is the necessary surgery risky? Will the dog become lethargic and fat as a result? Will the dog be depressed? A little research into the procedures and effects of spaying or neutering will allay the fears of most dog owners and some may even be pleasantly surprised to find that their dog will actually benefit from the procedure for years to come.    What is Spaying and Neutering?    The terms "spaying" and "neutering" are used to describe those medical procedures performed on a dog in order to render it unable to reproduce. "Spaying" is used in reference to female dogs, while "neutering" is used when referring to a male.     When a female dog is spayed, the uterus and ovaries are removed. This prevents the dog from going into heat. When a male dog is neutered, the testicles are removed. Both procedures are done by veterinarian in a surgical environment. If there are no complications, then the dog can usually go home on the same day that the procedure is done.    The Community-Related Benefits of Spaying or Neutering Your Dog    The overpopulation of unwanted, domestic animals has become a huge problem in America. Animal shelters are overflowing with pets for which there are no homes and packs of homeless dogs can pose a health and safety hazard to the general public. Each year, over 4 million unwanted dogs and cats have to be euthanized (killed in a human manner) and that number is steadily growing. These unwanted animals don't just materialize from out of nowhere, however. They are the products of pets that were never taken in to be spayed or neutered by their owners.     For some dog owners, not having their pet spayed or neutered is simply a matter of laziness. They keep meaning to take their pet in, but time slips away; and, before they know it, their male dog has impregnated the dog next door or their female dog is expecting a litter of puppies. For other dog owners, the reasons for not having a dog fixed may be financial. Any surgical procedure, even for a pet, can be expensive. There are, however, low-cost spaying and neutering programs available. Check with your local humane society for information on qualifying for and utilizing them.    The Health and Behavioral Benefits of Spaying or Neutering Your Dog  Any risks associated with the surgical spaying and neutering procedures are far outweighed by the long-term health and behavioral benefits. In female dogs, the most obvious benefit is that there will be no litters of puppies and none of the health risks associated with that process. If your dog is spayed before she ever goes into heat, then the risk of her ever developing mammary tumors (malignant or benign) is almost completely erased. Furthermore, her risk of developing any reproductive organ cancers and infections (uterine and ovarian cancers or uterine infections) is obviously reduced significantly as well. If you wait until after her first heat cycle to have her spayed, then her chances of developing some of these conditions is almost doubled.    Without the mood swings, yelping and howling that a heat cycle brings on, your female dog will experience less stress. You'll also experience less stress by not having to deal with blood-stained carpet, bedding or furniture.    Your male dog will also enjoy many health benefits if you have him neutered. As with the female dog, if the neutering procedure is done early (before 6 months of age) the chances that your dog will develop reproductive-related cancer (i.e. penile cancer) or disease is just about cut in half. The danger of your dog getting struck by a car while in pursuit of a breeding partner is also eliminated.     Early neutering can also help control or altogether eliminate certain behavior in the male dog. Behaviors such as spraying, marking and the desire to run away are very much linked to a dog's hormones. Without such hormone production, your dog is less likely to develop these behaviors. Neutering your male dog could also render him easier to handle in social situations where other dogs are present. He will be less likely to show aggression toward other male dogs and will not be compelled to try and breed with an available female, even if she is in heat.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Un-neutered males don't necessarily run away in search of mates.    Neutered males go after bitches in heat, too.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, in general, this is true! But there are exceptions to every rule of life, and I have had several neutered dogs that loved to jump the fence and run and or climb the fence and run all over the place. Besides the neuter job, you might need an electric wire around the top part of your fence and the dog wears a special collar that gives it a little shock when it tries to jump the fence and run away! Some dogs love to run!|`|AA11179899	It won't!  Neutering dogs just calms them down. Period.|`|ktfuE9Ttaa	i dont think it does but if i had to say......maybe it knows it has no chance with a female and will stay home .... lol :)|`|i5c6wJoYaa	It keeps your dog from straying, looking for a mate, thus keeping it from wanting to wander away. It also helps prevent bringing any unwanted puppies into the world.     SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PETS!|`|skWN7jWHaa	he will be much less agitated and he wont need to run off trying to get his groove on|`|07658108bf84ff22af742f784fa5ea0aaa	It won't.  Only a fence will keep a dog from taking off.  Neutering will lessen roaming for females in heat.|`|okAYAGvXaa	The inborn instinct to "reproduce" is broken.  BTW, I don't think you are the only one "confused" here.|`|AA10500537	yes  but you still cant let it run loose
y7igESfUaa	My guess, she wants attention.    Cats will learn to "talk back" when they know that it elicits a response out of us. When she meows, you ask her what's wrong and she'll meow back. Her way of just holding a conversation. It doesn't necessarily means that anything is wrong.    She's also taught you to give her attention when she meows. You'll put your face close to hers and when she rubs against you, she'll scent-marking you. Sort of claiming you as 'hers'. They like this and so when you pick your head up, she meows to tell you to put it back down.    She's learned that when she meows, she gets something pleasurable. Whether it be her food or water or some sort of attention from you. Don't worry about it. If you like her being so talkative (I love when my cats talk), continue to do what you're doing. If you want her to meow less, try ignoring her when she meows and giving her attention when she's quiet. It'll work like a charm.    Good luck with your little one! :]    EDIT: I also wanted to add about her grooming your husband during the night. It's her way of saying that she appreciates and loves you (or him, in this case). A mother cat will groom her kittens for hours to clean them but most importantly, to tighten the bond between them. That's precisely what she's doing to your husband. Tightening the bond between him and herself. Take it as a compliment.|`|WeXjMABDaa	maybe she's pregnant|`|bwjf8D31aa	it needs a crap|`|iDxoM3X8aa	She is just being a loving cat.i have a male who does this don,t worry she sounds fine.|`|51Ib0kxVaa	she loves the attention. She just wants to be wtih you all the time. My cat is the same and she's got worse over the years.

I don't understand it, but she's done it for years.....|`|BmI2fszPaa	She wants attention. Give her more love.  My cat washes my hair at night too. Its a way of showing affection & love for someone.

V2FuF8Gaaa	Based by my liking I would go with California Natural, but I also like Canidae too. Its not that is is better than the other it is just what my dogs like. I think Canidae may be the most common.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Do you have Petco and Petsmart?     As for what's best, that will depend on your dog.

iXijnCxOaa	I have Bernese Mtn Dogs and Samoyeds.  They are completely different in personality.    Yes, they get along well but as breeds have very different play styles.  The Bernese like to throw their weight around.. body checking  ~ Sams tend to like to wrestle, box and grab legs and ruffs.    It takes 3 Bernese to tire out one Samoyed.    Personally, I probably wouldn't leave a Husky (or a Sam) loose in the house or unattended in the yard.  Their idea of fun extends beyond what I find acceptable.    It is crucial that you buy from responsible breeders.  Temperament is critical when you are planning a multi-dog household.... and, of course, health is imperative.  Saving $$ by buying from a backyard breeder can be very expensive in terms of extra training $ and vet bills.|`|L22hVXTIaa	The breed type of dogs is really not an issue when considering how two dogs will interact.  If you get both as puppies, show them love, care and discipline, they should do fine together.  Be sure to have both neutered so that you don't have the male aggression and territory issues going on.  Good luck!|`|JtYNXoRdaa	I can't imagine there being a problem, especially getting both as puppies. Just make sure you have enough time to devote to exercise for these two!!|`|mnufOa6eaa	Yes, they would get along. The breed doesn't matter as long as they're raised around each other. My mom has 3 dogs, a American Staffordshire Terrier, a Great Pyrenees, and a Shar Pei/ Terrier mix. I have an Australian Shepherd a German Shepherd mix. My mom's first two and my two were all raised with each other around and got along with no problems. My mom's new one(the Shar Pei mix) is getting along just fine with mine and my mom's other dogs as they are all around each other, my moms every day obviously and mine often. So that's five different dog breeds or mixes that are getting along.    If you will be a first time dog owner, I would personally not get 2 puppies at the same time. Puppies are a lot of work, 2 would be even more work. You have to housebreak them, and it's hard to watch 2 puppies at the same time, train them, hard to do both at the same time(would have to seperate them or each work with one and even that isn't gauranteed to work as they could be distracted by each other). I'd personally get one to start with and get the other when your first is already housebroken and at least somewhat trained if you must have them both be close in age. Otherwise, get the one, train it well, wait until it's at least 1, maybe 2, then get the other one. That is personally what I'd do.|`|FQnF8it2aa	I have a Husky and my parents have a Bernese Mountain Dog! They just both turned a year old and met for the very first time and got along great. Bernese's are usually pretty chill and laid back. However, Huskies are just crazy and hyper. I thought that both of them together was a great mix. The Bernese is about twice my Husky's weight so she can definitely handle her own, but she would definitely tire my Husky out after a half hour of play! I think that definitely if you got them when they were both a year old or younger that they would become great siblings! Good luck!
z90jPBMLaa	it really counts what hes mixed with and what you feed him. He doesn't sound like he will get real big. some terrier breeds maybe weight 10+ pounds none are over 50+ pounds. He doesn't sound like he will get big at all. he will be smaller dog.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	Well since he is a terrier he'll probably get about around 50 to 40 pounds the most.  unless you feed him alot xD|`|tPGxPDvBaa	At 12wk triple the weight or at 16wk double the weight for close guess at adult weight.  This formula works well for small & med size dogs. You probably looking at 15-18lb range.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You're looking at maybe a 15 lb dog.      Our Lab pups were 20 + lbs at 10 weeks.  They are all now 80 - 95 lbs. at 1 yr.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Without pictures or even knowing what terriers he has in him it's very hard to guess, some terriers are small like JRT's or Rat Terriers and others can be quite large.    Hard to guess, look at the size of his paws, if they are huge then he'll be pretty big, if they are small then he'll remain small.|`|NMQWAFkTaa	At 10wks you double the weight and add a half pound. So I would say about 10lbs but could be up to 12lbs.

bB0qV51Haa	I can't tell from your description if you have a maine coon or not but oddly enough we took in a stray last Christmas who was also emaciated and had what we thought was short fur. Once she'd been fed a steady healthy diet for a few months she grew long fur too! I figured her fur seemed shorter because she was so scrawny and her body didn't have enough nutrients to keep up with her true fur. I have suspected she's a maine coon mix because her fur texture (long outer coat with a short thick undercoat) is the same as our oldest cat who is definitely a maine coon mix. Neither of them have the ear tips of a pure bred but they are still adorable kitties.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	My MaineCoon was 8 weeks old when I got him from the pound. . he weighted 22lbs most of his life, if he is a real Mainecoon he will get very large but that is what the breed is, you don't put them on diets they are 'fur people' and have lots of personality, have a small meow, and are very endearing.   When my died at 18 years old we cried for months.

I could watch them on youtube all day and not get bored! lol  I especially love the "talking cats" and the one that looks like a Russian Blue kitten talking back and forth with it's owner...."do want to sleep a little longer?" and the kitten does the sweetest meow back and you know it means "yes".  The convo. goes on for a minute or so and it's sooooo cute!

c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	I think you're confused here.  Uromastyx are NOT geckos, they are a completely different species of lizard not closely related to geckos.  The most common types are mali and egyptian.  I'd take a look at some pictures from this website and try to see which one looks the most like yours: http://www.kingsnake.com/uromastyx/|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	Not all lizards are geckos... And Uromastyx require very specific care, including a basking spot of at least 120 degrees.  Check out the care sheet at http://www.deerfernfarms.com ... Doug is the best Uro expert around.  If it's a baby it can be hard to determine exactly what species it is, but I'd bet it is a Mali Uro, they are the most common in the pet trade.    PLEASE check out the care sheet, Uro's are great lizards but they aren't a good beginner lizard.  They need a lot of heat, a lot of room, and a strict diet.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	That is not a gecko, it is just a Uromastyx. They are not in the same family at all. There are 13 different types of Uro, such as, Mali, egyptian and ornate.     I have never seen a Uro with spikes in their legs. You might want to post a picture so we can help you better.
AA12083992	Teething, okay. Diarrhea, not okay. Dogs, especially small dogs or pups get dehydrated very easily. If he's still got diarrhea tomorrow it would be wise to take him to a vet. Meanwhile feed him some boiled rice with a little chicken and a little canned pumpkin. Just pumpkin, not pumpkin pie filling!|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Diahrea means that your dog could have eaten something bad, and his stomach is not sitting well. Feed him chicken and rice (cooked) and give it to him warm. My vet told us to do that when our dogs were sick.|`|rk7sN9Ryaa	The teething is normal.  However the diarrhea is not.  You should take him to a vet to get him checked for possible parasites that puppies frequently get or perhaps he may be allergic to the food that you're currently feeding him.  It could also be something as simple as an upset stomach from table scraps, but it's best to get it checked out.  Little dogs get dehydrated very easily, so it would be best to take him to the vet and if you have Nutri-Cal laying around, give him a little finger full of that.|`|vn5Y7qgsaa	if it is regular diarrhea that is not right and you should consider consulting a vet.     occasional diarrhea is nothing to be alarmed about    the two could be related----carefully consider what your dog is chewing on per teething as this could be related to the diarrhea    Consider food issues.

AA11992723	i'd worry more about the harm of over-vaccinating dogs!! if the needle was not used before and sterilized there isn't a problem for your daughter.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	If you didnt actually inject her with the syringe then I think you may be okay. I would google the name of the medicine and find info on whether or not it is harmful to humans.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I doubt it; since she wasn't actually injected.    I accidentally jabbed myself with a needle that had been used to vaccinate a dog.|`|kekFN3RIaa	If you didnt put it into her and push it down I think she'll be ok.    It depends on the shot as well.|`|dn2tsXlBaa	Well if it just kinda poked her, she should be okay. If you actually injected her with it, well I have no idea. She'll be fine.|`|ISNdzRCHaa	If your daughter was just merely poked, the acid barrier in her skin should completely protect her from any ill effects of the vaccination. If you are able to put pressure on the area of the puncture, and no blood rises to the surface, she should be okay. That means that the needle didn't penetrate far enough for anything to have gotten into her blood stream.    Also, if you used a different gauge to draw the vaccination, and a different one for actually injecting, then there shouldn't have been any of the vaccine on the tip of the needle.    And, if there was, I bet the amount would be very trace. So long as no pressure had been applied to the syringe, and no copious amounts were injected, I'm sure she is fine.    And especially since it would probably be metabolised by the muscles, if it did make it past the acid barrier of the skin, I would only worry if she shows any signs of illness.|`|XvaaaadYaa	if you didnt push down on the plunger, you should be fine.
8auekxEyaa	before i start: mini horses are just as much work as full sized horses. I worked for 6 years in a 15 stall barn in my backyard. You must:   Clean the stall every day in the winter, if you keep it outside in the summer then you can cut down on that a bit.   Provide clean water, grain AND hay.  Get the horse's hooves looked at 3-5 times a year by a farrier to keep them in order.  Have regular vet visits.  Keep a blanket on them in the winter, and keep the flies off of them in the summer (they can bite their faces pretty badly)     This is just the normal off the top of my head list. There is a lot that goes into the maintenance of a horse, be sure you're very careful about your decision and make sure you have PLENTY of room!|`|y8HyP1bzaa	I'm sorry, but if you don't have the slightest clue of the responsibility involved, then you have no business getting a pony.|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Hanna needs to get off her high horse.  I commend you for taking the time to try and learn what you can before purchasing a pet. No one is born with this knowledge and you have recognized that you need the information before purchasing.     I keep mine miniature horses in a stall just like any full size horse and I use wood fencing.  Some people I know use electric fences with large horses but I don't feel comfortable doing this with smaller animals.     Keep researching and good luck!|`|vaulPrAmaa	run in shed for me - depending on the horse.  all horses will adapt eventually though.  if your horse is wild or likes jumping and breaking fences and eating them go with electric, but I personally prefer wood.  get a mini donkey for a stable mate if you don't want another horse, but get a stable mate  (donkey, goat, pig, retired horse/meat horse, etc)

vJ0NhNXcaa	She is trying to play with you. Dogs like attention but don't always want to be picked up or handled. Try getting a toy to play with her. Try to sit with her and when she comes to you give her a treat. Sometimes it takes training with treats to adjust a dogs behavior. Good luck!|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Your dog is playing with you. This isn't just a bichon frise characteristic- any dog that wants attention knows how to initiate a game of "chase" for fun!
qDG7FQsgaa	Unfortunately aside from getting another cat or having someone stay with the cat, there's not a lot you can do to make her less lonely. I suggest you leave the radio or tv on (low volume) so that she feels like there's someone there talking to her, and maybe getting a cat tree so she's got something else to play on with her ribbon. You could also look into putting a bird feeder outside a window where she can watch the birds. Most of all, when you are home, be sure to give her as much attention as you can! Remember, given that you've only had her for a week, she will still need to go through an adjustment period, and if she was previously in an environment with other pets, she will be missing her friends.|`|fIjB97qqaa	Kick her!|`|Dhsyroekaa	she just wants attention and love. you need to give her more of that. try getting on of those plastic sticks with the feather at the end. also little play mice.  playmat would be best since you are hardly ever home but that is not an otpion so for now the poor kitty will have to adjust being lonley|`|psqkf6rMaa	buy telequarium its good for cats to watch|`|JdmwlvSRaa	put the song lonely- Akon in the computer and tie her up near the computer and make her listen the song or give it to somebody else who could take care of it nicely.|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	Ah, that's sad. Yea why exactly can't she be in the bedroom? Cats love their owners. They want to be with them all the time. I agree with everyone else. Your best bet is to leave a window curtain up so she can look outside, or leave a tv or radio on. I've heard that a million times with animals to keep them from feeling so alone. Getting another cat may NOT be the answer. Then you take the risk of her thinking you are trying to replace her. I've had cats that I thought it would be sweet to get a new kitty and then the new kitty comes along and it made my older cat leave because they felt like I was replacing them. It was very sad. So don't get a new kitty, that will just make it worse.     If you live in Texas, let me know! I'll take her if you can't cope with her anymore. I just say let her in your bedroom and that'll be half your battle.|`|BmI2fszPaa	You can try leaving the tv going for her, I had a cat that loved to watch tv. Why is adopting another cat not an option? And why is she not allowed in your bedrooms? Keeping her the way she is can be considered a form of animal cruelty. At the very least she will become less and less sociable as time goes on. I'm sorry for you & for her both, imagine how lonely she must be. I would bite the bullet and get her a friend.|`|zT0oQqLWaa	There really isnt anything you can do.......You COULD try leaving the radio or tv on, she might think just because she hears people that someones there. Also spend as much time with her as you can when you are home    Other than that im really not sure. She may just grow out of it, but chances are shes very very lonley if no one is home with her for that long. In turn she could get depressed, which could make her sick.|`|Wlstb4igaa	I really think you should consider giving your cat back to whomever you adopted her from as she is obviously in distress.  If you got her from an animal welfare charity they will understand and perhaps you would be able to adopt an older animal who would not mind being left alone for so long.  It's really not fair on a young sociable cat to be left alone for such long periods.  Please try to see things from her point of view.  As far as she is concerned, you are her parent and she will not be able to understand why she is left alone for so long.      Please give this suggestion some thought as it would be fairer to your cat.      If you adopted her from a private home, then I'd recommend you approach a cat welfare charity (such as Cats Protection, if you live in the UK).  The people there will understand and will gladly take her and find another home where she will have more company.  They will probably also be able to suggest another more suitable cat for you from amongst their cats who are waiting for adoption.
AA11992723	I never heard of a miniature retriever?? I had to google that..and see there's a lot of sites for "mini golden retrievers" go figure..the endless ways people will BYB. (im not accusing you of anything, i'm accusing those irresponsible people who rip others off creating these ridiculous "breeds" out of sick and runts of the litters)    Anyway, your dog may have arthritis. did the vet say anything about that? she is a senior dog now, and will go through some changes. you can do little things to make her quality of life better. but call your vet and talk about it, your vet should be willing to discuss it over the phone for free.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	It could be the vision is going, or 100 other things.  I would go back to the vet and get an x-ray and a blood work up done.  The x-ray can show you how many issues you are dealing with and the stages, and a blood work up tells things like white cell counts.  Whenever my dog has a change in behavior, I go to the vets to find out what is going on that I am not aware of.  Good luck.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Did the vet do blood work or just listen to heart and lungs? I think you should at least call and tell the vet about the unusual behavior.|`|tTzTRBBfaa	First, I would phone the vet and ask if any of the shots that she was given could give any side effects that could be causing her behavior.  The vet would be best placed to offer advice since he/she knows your dog's health history.    Has there been any change in her diet or exercise as of late?|`|ODZeyNYMaa	Awww, poor baby! She sounds like she is bored and having anxiety issues. Have you been taking her for walks? Does she have toys and a playmate (meaning you or another human to toss toys and whatnot) to keep her occupied?  Do you have to leave her for long periods of time? That can lead to anxiety. My dog found comfort in being in his crate when we are gone. He loves it! If we close the door to it when we are here, he cries, so I don't feel guilty leaving him in there for a few hours. I hope you find a solution. Good Luck!|`|OxFsslN8aa	As my golden retriever aged and his hearing & vision got worse, he would follow me around more closely.  I think was for comfort as much as for companionship.  Just a note - when dogs get sick (cancer or something like that) they tend to go off on their own & hide more often. Your dog is doing the opposite so try not to focus on that.|`|bwjf8D31aa	miniature retriever? no such breed??      words of wisdom    TAKE HER TO A VET UH OH!|`|02Rrrz47aa	is she nuerotic?|`|D94lQmDZaa	....probably cracked out or something.|`|AA10500537	sounds like someone abused her recently .  maybe when it was outside  she seen a strange animal and  scared her,  keep an eye on her and baby it a bit more she wants attention
6L0tVhn7aa	Damsels are territorial and Domino's are no exception..it's probably an intimidation flash to warn the other fish it's encroaching on it's territory (Unless your other fish is also a Domino in which case it could be a mating dance).|`|h4wNRqf9aa	he goes in front of the other fish, spreads his fins and kinda shakes a little bit?      that's agression...    what size tank is it and what other fish are there?    if there's no nipping there's nothing to worry about.... for now    keep an eye on them
m4uDn0ofaa	Neutering is well worth it.  Benefits include, better health which leads to longer life.  You will never have to worry about cancer in his male parts.  Neutering will also lower any aggressive tendencies your dog may have, and it will also lower his desire to want to run away.  It may also make him more dog friendly to other male dogs.  Good luck and I hope you do choose to neuter you puppy.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Very much.    Not only will his temperament improve (not that it's bad now), but he'll be less likely to run away. It also means he can't produce puppies which means less unwanted dogs.    I think neutering means he's less likely to get certain diseases.|`|JBPsePnwaa	He will be less likely to run away, he will not contribute to the increasing pet population  and  he won't get testicular cancer|`|KxjUim7yaa	I don't have any disadvantages. It make for a more "focused on you" pet|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Males don't really have that many heath benefits when neutered.    Neutering can change your dog's personality: it can exaggerate an aggressive streak, develop aggression when there previously was one, turn him into a wimp, make him hump-crazy.    Un-neutered dogs don't necessarily wander, mark in the house (improperly housetrained dogs will do that, no matter how neutered they are), or start fights.    Neutering will not stop humping, and neutered dogs do go after bitches in heat.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	There are very few downsides to neutering.    For a male dog it prevents testicular cancer and there is a lot of research to show it reduces the chance of prostate cancer. These cancers are probably more common than you think.    It is definitely worth it. How else can you be sure he will never sire puppies? It's the last thing the world needs while the pounds and rescue shelters are bursting with dogs.    It also stops some unwanted behaviour, e.g. marking in the house, humping, uncontrollability around females, and male to male dominance aggression.    It's in a dog's best interests. He won't miss his balls one bit.|`|L8bUf2pvaa	i would say it is worth it because dogs can get cancer and diseases from not being neutered. after my do was neutered, i noticed he was less hyper (in a good way) and started to obey me more and go to the bathroom outside. a month after the procedure is over, the hormones in the dogs body tend to lessen and slow down which contributes to these factors.|`|AA10815622	The longer you postpone fixing a pet the higher chance for genital cancer. There are many studies out that prove a lower instance of cancer related to earlier neutering or spaying.     Also neutering usually tone down aggression levels and keeps most male dogs from marking and/or humping everything. However, again the longer you wait the more ingrained these behaviors become. Therefore marking and humping may persist.    Additionally, on the off chance that you male dog comes in contact with a female in Heat he may produce offspring which will contribute to the over crowding problem in shelters. The supply of puppies is higher then the demand of puppies therefore many puppies are placed in shelters and many of them are euthanized.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	There are many advantages--the dog is less prone to a variety of illnesses; the dog is easier to socialize, less aggressive and unable to impregnate other dogs; the dog is less likely to run away, hump people and things; the dog is less likely to pee in the house or pee every 30 seconds on walks.  There is no disadvantage other than the dog being unable to breed, and there's rather too much of that anyway.|`|AA10500537	neutering makes a much better pet,  they dont run and  never have the problem of having a bunch of mongrel pups that no one wants and then they get abandoned|`|AZXYoUHIaa	A neutered dog usually lives longer just because they have no risk of testicular cancer now. Also, they usually won't hump anymore or chase after female dogs, and should get along better with male dogs. (Although, since your dog is being neutered later in life, some of these habits may already be engrained in his lifestyle and he may not get rid of them.) As far as I know, there aren't any disadvantages to neutering, except maybe the occasional complication from surgery. It is ALWAYS worth it to get your dog neutered/spayed!!
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	Chi's are extremely high strung. It's their natural instinct to attach themselves to one person or family to the point they do tend to get separation anxiety.    One thing that will help... have her sleep in something she doesn't wear often, get her scent all over it, and bring that along so he has the scent of his human to relax him.    They also have this toy where you can record your voice. My dogs have found it very soothing whenever I left.    there is also a petsitter DVD that has the sound of dogs barking, while showing videos of dogs in agilities training, sometimes they get close ups of dogs... and there's a subliminal "Good dog" message embedded throughout the video.    My dogs will watch it like they're watching an excited action movie and it keeps them calm.    try one or all of these three techniques.    when you get him to calm down long enough to stop barking, give him a treat and say "good calm".     that way everytime he calms down to enjoy his other luxuries... he'll associate it with good behavior that will get treated.    this worked for me with my dog who had seperation anxiety|`|dRUgXlOLaa	What is Separation Anxiety?     When you leave the house, it is nice to know that your dog goes to his favorite spot and sleeps peacefully until you return. However, dogs suffering from separation anxiety are not so lucky. Separation anxiety can appear in dogs that have not been properly socialized, dogs that have been moved from one home to another and dogs that are naturally nervous.     Your dog is a social pack animal who relies on others (you) for individual protection and security. Dogs that lack confidence due to socialization issues, understanding of expected behavior, or possible maltreatment in the past (adopted dogs), are more likely to exhibit behaviors related to separation anxiety.    Essentially, when you leave to go to work or even just to the corner store for five minutes, your dog becomes upset, stressed and confused. Dogs with separation anxiety can do everything from whining and barking, to ripping apart your couch and eating your duck feathered pillow.     How do I know if my dog has Separation Anxiety?    There is much debate over the cause of separation anxiety. Some believe it is a lack of confidence that causes the dog to rely to much on their humans. In this case, you have to teach your dog to accept the fact that you are leaving, and it's going to be ok.     If you have a dog with separation anxiety, you will know. Dogs will usually exhibit a combination of the following:     - The behavior often occurs when the dog is left alone.   - The dog makes a big deal when his owner leaves, or comes home.   - When left alone the dog will exhibit behavior which is not common to his normal behavior.   - The dog may not eat if the owner is not in the room   - The dog will follow his owner around constantly     What ever the cause is, here are some techniques for solving the problem.     What can be done?     Make your Departure and Arrival Routine     Make your dog realize that your departures and arrivals are nothing to get excited over. Usually the dog feels the greatest amount of anxiety shortly after you leave. Therefore you need to practice with your dog the routine of coming and going.     Lots of Exercise!     Exercise is believed to relieve stress in both humans and dogs alike. A long walk, run, or play session prior to leaving can go a long way in helping to reduce the stress and anxiety of your dog.     Give Your Dog Something to Do While You Are gone.     If your dog has something entertaining to do while you are away, he will be less likely to become stressed and anxious. A stuffed Kong filled with a tasty treat is an excellent example.     Confine Your Dog While You Are Away     Some dogs are more comfortable being confined to their own den. A crate is an ideal space for your dog. A dog who is properly crate trained is less susceptible to get into trouble while you are gone. If a crate is not an option, confine him to one room or limit access to the whole house.     Introduce Another Dog     If your dog has another companion to keep him company while you're gone, it may help alleviate the boredom and tension caused while you are away. Of course this is only one option. There are many other factors to take into consideration before adding another dog to your home.     Set Aside Time For Your Dog     Make time during your day to give undivided attention to your dog. This time can be spent playing, teaching, or even just taking a nap together. If possible, try to make this one-on-one time prior to departures.     Leave the Radio or TV On     Leave a radio on in a separate room. The dog will hear the voice and will feel less alone. Some people even leave voice recordings of themselves in hopes to calm the dog.     Depending on the severity of anxiety, you may need to contact a behavior specialist through your vet.     This website only provides BASIC information about Separation Anxiety. your veterinarian is always your best source of health information. Consult your veterinarian for more information about Separation Anxiety and its prevention.|`|pjrPYAasaa	I only had to read the title...this is how you train him...    Leave the room for about 10 seconds, when you come back in the room and he's quiet, give him a treat... expand the time frame that you were out of the room like 2 min. and reward with silence...if he whines when you just left, tell him to sit and stay, if he gets up, repeat, only come back in the room if he is quiet and then reward.    what you will be telling him is that when you are quiet and don't whine, your mommy comes back...if you keep this process of you leaving and entering again, he will be more accustomed to you coming back instead of him thinking "she left me !"...|`|OxFsslN8aa	Do you carry him around a lot?  Does he sit on your lap often?  Does he sleep wiht you?  If you answer yes, then you need to find a way to make your dog a dog & put him down.  Buy him a bed of his own, make him sit on the floor next to you but not on you.  Have him walk more than being carried.  All of these things will help him to feel independent.|`|MLSJD4cyaa	Maybe you should leave it alone a little more often so it gets used to being alone trust me it worked for both of my dogs.My insane Lab and Poodle. Separation Anxiety forms when you pay an incredibly large amount of your attention to you dog so maybe you should pay a little less attention. Also, if you watch the show IT'S ME OR THE Dog you can learn a lot from that show.
Uy79dKEmaa	Here is a little trick I discovered when feeding my own cats. They are littermates, a boy and a girl, and the boy likes to switch back and forth between his bowl and her bowl. He is the faster eater, so she would end up with less food. To solve the problem, I put out 3 bowls of food. One with the girls portion, and split the boys portion into 2 bowls. He's so busy switching between his 2 bowls, that his sister gets to eat her fill in peace. It seems too simple, but it's been working for me for quite a while now.    Hope this helps you too.|`|qDG7FQsgaa	Honestly, your best bet is to separate them. Put one in a room with the food bowl and close the door. Then put the food bowl out for the other one in a different are of the house. Let them eat until they stop - once they stop eating, take away the rest of the food from both cats. They will get the idea that when you feed them they have to eat it at that point or be hungry later. The smaller cat just might not need/want as much as the other cat. The easiest way to check if the smaller cat is underweight is to simply rub it's sides - you should be able to feel ribs, but only very slightly.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	I have a cat that used to be a nibbler like your skinny cat and a cat who is a hoover vacuum cleaner like your bigger cat! Since we brought the big eater into the house, the nibbler has learned to eat her fill before the other cat has a chance to come and try to eat her food. If i see the other cat trying to eat out of her bowl, i spray her with a water bottle. Otherwise, you might want to separate them for feeding time and yes, take away whatever your skinny cat doesn't eat and offer it to her a few hours later. Good luck!|`|AA10645224	ALWAYS LEAVE OUT DRY CAT FOOD IN SEPARATE BOWLS FOR BOTH OF THEM    THEN FEED THEM THE WET IN SEPARATE BOWLS|`|RAtgv9GHaa	get 2 bowls,put them in diff. rooms,and give the skinny cat   a little more (2 and a half cups)|`|t1OIcAG3aa	hahaha.  cute.    always leave out dry food, a ton of it (kittens need as much food as they can eat)... the one whose eating more will not eat all of it and the other will be able to eat afterwards.  when you feed wet food, put it in separate bowls.  though you don't want to, it may be necessary to feed them in separate rooms, if separate food bowls does not work.|`|Spycl8Ikaa	get two bowls and seperate them.|`|WMo6Wl0Iaa	hello,     separate them into different rooms and make sure that the fatter one stops eating allot make sure they get the same amount of food and water           good luck with them       :)  :)            :)   :) :) :)                 :)      :) :)
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	1. its illegal to own primates in certain states... so you have to check with your local municipality.    2. Monkeys have diseases that can be spread to humans that are dangerous for humans.    3. It's near impossible to get the "wild" out of monkeys. They are not domestic animals. they are very destructive ... even the "Trained" ones. The need LOTS of exercise as they have a lot of pent up "wild" energy. They are harder to care for than toddlers.    4. they are VERY expensive to purchase and VERY expensive to feed, house, and provide general care for, and the smaller they are, the more complicated their delicate systems can be. smaller doesn't mean easier.    5. You will have a very hard time finding a vet that can offer proper pet care to primates unless you live in a country or state where owning primates is common. Vet care with these guys are essential... so if primates are not illegal in your area, I'd call to see if any vets even see primates.    if they do, I guarantee they'll be expensive... if they don't, don't even bother getting one.    I know you said you don't want to hear people tell you to check if they're legal where you live or tell you how nasty they are and not to get one,    but sweetie that's something you need to know. that is the truth about primates. This is why many people who get a primate as a pet, usually end up neglecting it. they don't take time to learn the negatives. they just say "How cool is it to own a monkey!?"    people need to tell you the TRUTH so you don't get in over your head which can hurt you AND the monkey.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Well just google them & ask around people who have had experience in owning one|`|ssiqDLKsaa	just type in monkeys in google and read the pages about them|`|czL4DjNlaa	Why don't you just post questions on Yahoo Answers?|`|AA10645224	YOU CAN'T HAVE A MONKEY FOR A PET ANYMORE|`|P8hOtEdOaa	First of all, there has never been a case of a PET monkey spreading a disease to humans as reported by the CDC.    Unfortunately the reason they ask you if it is legal is because a lot of states and localities have bans on them.    You can email me and I will put you into contact with monkey owners with their permission.

kWwgWSSgaa	Take the dog to your local vet to rule out any underlying medical condition which may account for the change in behaviour. For example an undiagnosed underactive thyroid can make a dog irritable.    If your dog is healthy then an experienced professional dog trainer would be best placed to assess your dog & outline what might be the best course of action.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	wow poor dog there must be a reason for this so take him to the vets sometimes its because they are hurt in some way and he needs a physical .Is he fixed if not then that may be a reason for aggression too.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Take him to a vet. If this is abnormal behaviour for him he may well be unwell or hurt.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Any sudden change in behavior calls for a trip to the vet.|`|AA12083992	A change in behavior could be medical issues, see a vet.  You have a bully breed. They need strong, confident, experienced trainers/handlers. You are not. Get the dog in obedience classes geared for aggressive dogs before this behavior takes root. If not you will end up with an out of control, dangerous dog.   Neutering helps.|`|M7yJJKB9aa	If there have been any changes in his environment, it can cause this. Some dogs behavior will change if you add another person or pet to your home. Even something like having people over to your house for a day or two can cause odd behavior. Silly changes like re-arranging furniture, bringing in a new house plant have been known to upset pets. Lastly, try to think what, if anything is different. Has there been a change in your regular routine, or his? Has the amount of time you normally spend with him has decreased due to work or school? These are some things that you may want to consider. I hope you get to the root of the problem. Good Luck!|`|sIyei0bFaa	he may be in pain. if he is he might not be wanting you to touch him. take him to your vet|`|okAYAGvXaa	At 19 months you deal with a mature dog. To be quite honest, this is quite scary. Seek help before it's too late. Not here though!|`|CfqQDn7Zaa	First, go to the vet and check for any deceases.     If your dog does not have any illnes or whatsoever i would definately suggest a different attitude towards your partner and your dog.    Since i have been following a different training and learning program from Cesar Millan my dogs behave very normal (i have 6 dogs in total). And it is all question of attitude and vibe.    At least try to get the book: being the pack leader from Cesar, will help you out to define certain difficulties you have with your dog and how to solve the problem.|`|AA10500537	take it to a trainer  or doggy school and they will train her back to normal  she needs attention|`|RT8LZy7gaa	First, is he neutered? This could explain the emergent dominant behavior.  Where did he run off to? If he's not neutered, maybe after a female in heat.    But a vet can diagnose a sudden change in behavior.  If there is no medical reason, your best bet is to get some obedience training.  You HAVE to assert that you are the alpha, not him.  I strongly suggest your partner attend obedience with you so the dog will also recognize him/her as the alpha as well (or the alpha's mate so to speak).  His pack order needs to be established.    Until you figure it out, I wouldn't suggest letting him off the lead to run, especially if he's already bitten you. You never know what he'll do if a complete stranger approaches him.|`|tUDuVp3Taa	Is your animal sterilized & are you the only owner for 19 months?  Any training or temperament testing done? Any idea the temperament of the parents?It could be a medical issue,breeding of an aggressive line,an alpha animal pulling rank.  To protect other people and animals, it is your responsibility to erect escape proof fencing or enclosures.  This is a serious post needing immediate attention.  Until this animal is checked, keep others away from him.Right now you have an unstable and unpredictable animal for whatever reason.  An injury can never be taken back.
AA11330307	He is hyper.  The scent is so powerful when a female is in heat that it can actually make a male very hyper and sick.  If you are not going to breed the dogs get them spayed or nuetered. They have low cost to no cost spay/nueter clinics every where. If this problem keeps existing there is something else wrong. If you want to breed the dogs wait until the female has been in heat from 9 to 11 days.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Aw! the poor little baby, take him to a doctor quick........|`|66jX06Onaa	Try giving him some cooked & skinned potatoes, warm & mashed up and nothing on them. Sometimes this helps to settle their stomachs.    If he continues not to eat or drink, you best call the vet again.
5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	DO NOT accept this kitten till the kitten is 10-12 weeks old, the kitten NEEDS to be with the mother and siblings that long to "learn to be a cat"  this includes proper litter box behavior, proper playing etc.  it should be criminal for someone to remove a kitten from their mother and siblings at 6 weeks (unless there is good reason to like the mother is harming the kitten or something)|`|VMY7No0eaa	a lot of people think 6 weeks is too young..  but most of my cats have been 6 weekers!  so as long as he is eating well dry food then it will be ok  Know he will cry for his mom to find him (because he is lost) at whatever age he comes to you.  If you can wait a week that would be good.    To the person above who's cats are having kittens 2x a year GET YOUR CATS FIXED...

Many kittens are still nursing at 8-10 weeks old.  Its more then just nibbling on solid food or learning how to use the litter pan.    The IDEAL time to adopt a kitten is 10-12 weeks old.  I feel that 12-16 weeks is better.  There is a world of difference in behavior and confidence in the new home between an 8 week old kitten and a 12 week old kitten.    They need to be with mom/siblings for the first 10 weeks to learn proper behavior and social things.  Taking them before 10 weeks will result in a kitten with a lot of behavior problems such as biting too much, clawing at you, climbing curtains, etc.  And if taken before properly weaned they can "nurse" on blankets - some kittens never outgrow this.    Please do not adopt under 10 weeks old.  You will have a better adjusted kitten if its older.  And be sure to get him/her neutered/spayed by 3-4 months old because they can breed as young as 4 months old.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	I recommend 8 weeks and not anything younger. It needs the mother even at 6 and 7 weeks to learn basic things, and to make sure he was not weaned too early which isn't good. Tell them you will be glad to take him when he is 8 weeks.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Inform the kittens owner that State LAW is 7 weeks and as explained by others there is good reason for this.|`|BmI2fszPaa	6 weeks is too young. The spca wont give kittens under 8 weeks. I think 10 weeks is ideal.  Kittens that are taken away from mummy too young don't socialize as well and can have behavioral issues.  Try to persude them to keep the kittens longer, maybe donate some food?|`|qHGy9ra3aa	First make sure the kitten is eating solid food, then try to stall the owners till it is 7 weeks old.  Maybe offer them $10 to hold it till 7 weeks.|`|Oxdkporsaa	A kitten should stay with its mother for an absolute minimum of eight weeks and preferably 12 weeks. Although they may be "weaned" prior to eight weeks, they will still have the occasional need to nurse. Kittens taken from their mom cats before this time often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood.  They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats.  The time they spend with their mother and siblings is very important. Think about how you would have turned out if you were taken away from your parents too soon, and didnt have the proper role model to learn from. Often kittens that are separated from their mother too soon, will be very shy, and have social problems with other animals as well as humans.|`|SNLFVblhaa	i got my two "kittens" at 7 weeks, and my other one was rescued and we got him at 3 weeks..they are all fine now, but i say 8 weeks is the best..but most ppl say 12..6 weeks is OK, but you need to make sure he is winged off of his mother..also u could give them a little blanket while he's there and also take it home with u and let him sleep with it for awhile so it will still have the scent of his former home on it.|`|jAzkja82aa	9 weeks is perfect.  at 6 weeks it should still be feeding from the mother ( in small ammounts and rarely but they should depend upon the mother slightly untill 7 weeks ) i'd take it if i were you, you can buy substitute milk and make a kitten sling, look for how on instructables|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	It would be best if you waited until the kitten was 8 weeks old. They can leave at 6 weeks, but 8 weeks is much more ideal.    There are definite benefits to letting this kitten stay with his mother and siblings. Some people tend to believe that if a kitten (or puppy) is no longer nursing then it doesn't need it's mother anymore. However, there is a lot still going on. The young critter is learning how to be whatever it's supposed to be (in this case, a cat). He is learning from his mother what adult cats do and learning from his brothers and sisters how to interact with others. He's learning that if he plays too roughly, no one else wants to play, the basics of life.     I would wait until he is 8 weeks and then take him home. He will probably be a better cat because of it.|`|UdTFJuPpaa	Pedigree kittens have to be 13 weeks old and fully vaccinated. Why should non-pedigrees deserve any less? Separating a kitten from its mother at six weeks will lead to health problems that will be costly for you.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	8 weeks at the very least. That kitten needs more time with his mom, he is just starting on kitten food, maybe. He might still be weaning!       So yes 6 weeks is too young. Wait until he is 10 weeks. You could do it at 8 I guess....      Hope I helped! :)      P.S. Congratulations on the new kitten!

PGX0G4FOaa	He may be too attached to you. The way you describe it it sounds as if he is too much attached. Is he crate trained? Maybe if you have a crate you should get him used to you leaving the room and then coming back in so he knows when you gotta leave you will come back.   Are the other dogs good with him, he may be getting bullied. My Boston met a huskey in a puppy class and got bullied by her and wouldn't leave my side until the nice golden came over.   Does he get enough exercise? My boston is lively sometimes and is also a big cuddle bug.   Talk to Vet, a trainer, etc|`|D1beU6MPaa	I may get a ton of thumbs down but that is ok with me. I am of firm conviction that nothing should be alone, not even a goldfish. I put myself in any animals position and think what it would be like to be all alone with nobody to associate with. Yes, I know people love their pets and give them attention, but turn the tables for a minute. Think about what it would be like for a human to only have animals in their lives, and nobody to talk to. I realize that not everybody can have two of everything, but when there is an obvious case where a pet is showing signs of being lonely, if at all possible, I would get them a companion. Good luck|`|EdCgeNYDaa	My in-laws have a Boston Terrier, and they have researched the breed.  They are usually quite lively and active, but they also enjoy a "playmate".  You may want to consider a second Boston Terrier.  Good luck.|`|FeG3fKHZaa	Well, maybe you should try spending more time with him. . . maybe try buying him a toy or something. Dogs always like treats. . . maybe you could even take him to the dog park, or on a walk.

If your dog doesn't randomly attack you regularly, then depression is looking less and less like a practical differential diagnosis.    Your dog may be bored though. Their minds need to be stimulated, and I've seen the exact behavior your are talking about with dogs that have not had a lot of social interaction with other dogs.    This is not accusatory, just a general observation. Perhaps you should (If you don't already), take your dog on regular trips to the dog park. It could just be that your boston terrier is just very attached to you. No one dog acts the same as another, and they all have their own personalities.    I would recommend trying to get into a veterinarian, and if that does not work, seek a board certified veterinary animal behaviorist if you are really concerned.    Have a nice day, and I hope everything turns out ok!

Chickens produce an egg approximately every 27 hours, so you'll get about a dozen eggs daily.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Check out this site and ask them questions to achieve the desired results.

D6xfkCFoaa	All dogs have the potential to be dangerous but if you make sure to socialize the dog and he/she is treated well I am sure it would be a perfectly fine dog.|`|w7LI97idaa	No, it won't be any more dangerous then any other dog.  All dogs have different personalities- just be sure to train him and socialize him well with other dogs and people.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	ndsu_ is correct, any dog has the potential to be dangerous, some breeds will cause more damage than others but they can all become uncontrollable if allowed to be the leader of the pack which includes all members of the family and all other pets in the household.    When a dog comes into a new home for the first time, he checks out the energy of every member of the household, pets included. If one person or pet has assumed the leader role then the new dog will most likely follow that leader.  If on the other hand, as happens in most dog-owning homes, the owners unintentionally allow the new dog to assume the leader role, problems will develop.  Because as the leader, you get to make the rules and set the boundaries for all in the "pack". Obviously this does not work except in a wild pack of dogs.   So, to answer the question, a pitbull/lab mixed dog should not be anymore dangerous than any other dog if raised correctly. By that I mean, from the start, no mater what size the dog (since they all think alike) the owner must assume the leadership role because as dogs see it, leader leads rest of pack follows leader.    Check out the Cesar Millan "Dog Whisperer" site. He is a strong supporter of pitbulls and rottweilers and tries to spread the word that it is not the breed that is bad but the owners who allow dogs to be the leaders.  http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/addit...  http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/issue...|`|f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	any dog can be dangerous if you raise them to be.  Pitbulls are not dangerous dogs, Pitbulls that are taught to be dangerous are dangerous because they are so strong, if they are not taught to be aggressive then they will not be, same goes for any dog, Chihuahua or Pittbull, the breed has nothing to do with it.    Edit:  I am glad Deb brought up about Ceaser Milan because he is awesome and when I brought his name up on another post I got all sorts of thumbs down on that answer.  I so believe in his ways, I really believe that peole would not have the problems they do if they would go with his advice.|`|7HGKJYenaa	I think it has to do with nurture more than nature.  Everydog has its own personality regardless of its breed, I think it is important to train your dog and distinguish yourself as the alpha.  If you treat your dog well and keep them well socialized you should have no problems.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	Any dog is capable of being dangerous. And just because this dog has pitbull in him, it doesnt mean he is born dangerous. Make sure he has proper socialization, and keep up with the training.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Any dog can be dangerous.  It depends on who the parents were, how they've been raised, and if they've been properly socialized/trained.    Pitbulls are NON-aggressive.  Labs are very non-aggressive.  As long as you socialize the dog with people and other animals and train it to do basic commands (sit, stay, come, heel, wait, lay) you'll have a great dog!    I've seen very pretty (and big) Pitbull Lab mixes.  It was black in the shade like a Lab, but when it got in the sun you could see the brindle pattern like a Pit.  In general it looked like a Lab except for a slightly bigger nose and differently shaped ears.      If the mom is a Lab pups will look more like mom. If mom is a Pit pups will look more like mom.  However, if dad is a black Lab there will be pups that are black regardless of moms color.  If mom is a black Lab then the majority of the pups will have her color but some pit characteristics.  I say this because with Labs if the mother is black you have a better chance of black pups (black is the dominant color gene).    Either way....not dangerous.
zkME5iF2aa	My dog is also pregnant, this is her first litter (and mine) and I could tell because her nipples got bigger and her belly got bigger and harder. I really hope everything works out for you.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Get another vet.

Other than that you might just have to wait.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	i'm sure the obvious signs will be weight gain.  And possible nipple exposure.  If your dog is pregnant here is some info on that:    Are you getting ready for your dog to have puppies? Having a litter of pups sounds like a lot of fun, but there is much work involved. Here are some tips on how to get your dog and you ready for birth.    The first thing to know is that your dog will be pregnant on average for 63 days. This is not very much time so make sure you are ready.    You will want to make sure that you are feeding your pregnant dog appropriately. Your dog will need to eat more than usual and you may want to transition to a growth type food or puppy food during the pregnancy. You should do this by decreasing the amount of regular food you give your dog each day while increasing the amount of new food. It's best if you do this over the course of about a week to help prevent loose stool.    Check with your veterinarian to see what is appropriate for diet. Make sure to feed your dog a high quality diet. You do not need to supplement the diet with vitamins unless it is recommended by your veterinarian. Always follow their recommendations. Your dog may experience symptoms similar to human morning sickness around the third week of pregnancy. If this lasts longer than one week, take your dog to the veterinarian to see if there are any underlying problems.    You will want to continue regular walks with your dog during the pregnancy. It is important to get some exercise, but if you have a working dog or do sports with your dog, you will want to discontinue these until after the puppies are weaned. However, three weeks prior to delivery, you will want to isolate your pregnant dog from all other dogs. This must continue until at the very least, three weeks after the puppies are born. There are infectious diseases carried by unvaccinated dogs that may not be very harmful to adult dogs but can be fatal to puppies.     If your dog is due for vaccination during the pregnancy, hold off on this until after the puppies are weaned. Vaccination during pregnancy can be harmful to the fetuses. Ideally, you will want to have your dog vaccinated just prior to breeding.    When getting ready to deliver, make sure to provide a comfortable place for whelping and raising the puppies. It should be somewhere where your dog can come and go, but the puppies are confined to.     When it is time to deliver, your dog's body temperature will drop slightly. You can monitor this with a rectal thermometer. Normal canine temperature is between 100-102 degrees. When it drops below 100 degrees, you can usually expect labor in 24 hours. When your dog starts to go into labor, she will become restless and may pant, shiver, or vomit. This is normal. Make sure to provide fresh water to her at all times. This stage of labor may last up to 12 hours. When she begins to deliver the pups, they will be covered with a thin membrane which must be cleared away. The mother should do this herself, but should she neglect to do this, you will need to clear it away or the pup will suffocate. You will need to tie the umbilical cords in a knot and cut them above the knot. Pups will come about one per hour with up to half an hour of straining in between deliveries. It is not unusual for your dog to take a break of a few hours during delivery.     You will need to call your veterinarian if your dog does not deliver within one day of her temperature drop, she is straining to deliver for more than an hour, takes more than a four hour break between pups, seems to be in great pain, or has been pregnant for more than 70 days. Some breeds require cesarean sections so make sure to discuss this with your doctor prior to delivery. If you feel that anything else unusual is occurring, contact your veterinarian immediately.    It is always important to discuss all of your concerns and what to expect with your veterinarian prior to delivery.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	yes.  you can have her spayed.  please stop adding to the overpopulation problem.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	55 days for an x-ray to get the accurate   of pups.    Look for boobs dropping and filling with milk, stomach getting bigger...that's about it.      If you'd paid attention to your dog when she was in heat you'd have a better idea of whether or not you'll be expecting puppies.
htSZsds7aa	You are smart for not letting kitty out, but walking them is great, I have done this on several of my cats and they love it..there are alot of smells outside, and interesting things for them to see and do. They sell kitty harness's at pet stores and many are adjustable as the kitty grows  Have fun|`|7vJNHaskaa	Yeah, I do that for my cat, he doesn't try to bolt as much anymore and he loves being on the leash and exploring outside. I'd get a harness though cause cats can easily slip out of a regular collar,especially if they start doing a crocodile role like my cat did. (he wanted to chase a rabbit through my yard).|`|aeNiPKRBaa	yes i would take her for a walk if she seems to like the harness|`|VVrMSqGFaa	you should take her outside ones in a blue moon.|`|QGyYiEgZaa	yes, I would take her for a walk, I think she would enjoy it|`|JVMw3Ivdaa	If she is a kitten, now is the perfect time to start training her to be on a leash! =D Since it's too early to go outside just yet, I suggest you buy a harness and make her wear it inside the house to get accustomed to it.  Then attach the leash and "walk" her in your house.  By the time she goes outside, she won't be bothered by it anymore.    You can get special cat harnesses at most any pet store.  They look like miniature versions of a seeing-eye dog harness, almost.  They go around the neck, with a strap under the chest and/or between the shoulders, with a connected strap going around their front legs.  I wouldn't recommend walking a cat with just a collar, because they could slip their head out of it if they wanted to.|`|dorvAFBnaa	ive had lotsa cats for lotsa years, and they never go outside; there is NO REASON for them  to be there.  even when i take them to the vet, their feet NEVER touch the ground, as they are in a secure, comfy, ventilated carrier.  sure, lotsa cats like lotsa things, its their nature of curiousity; but that does not mean we jeopardize their well being by giving in to them.  that means:  stay indoors, no people food, no milk, no dog food, etc.  thanx !!|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	If she is fully inoculated and fixed get a cat harness and take her for a walk it's just fine.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	This is perfectly acceptable and I think its much better compared to simply letting her out by herself. Get a leash for puppies or perhaps a real cat harness and let her walk around your backyard or the block. She'll get to experience and explore the outdoors while you get to watch and make sure she doesn't get run over, attacked by dogs, or get into something that could make her sick.    Me and my boyfriend plan to do this with his cat. His cat keeps running outside so since he wants to be outside so badly, we were going to get a harness so he can be outside but still be safe.|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	Yes, you can i did it with my cat i even took my cat to a soccer game.|`|0678f343d65266fcb39ae78d8545fcf7aa	i have a cat who acts like that too. leashes/harnesses are safe as long as they are tight enough. they probably will be scared once your actually trying to walk them up the street, so i tend to just let mine lie on the porch with the leash on.
t2M1kXY4aa	From what I know of dogs, they tend to work out their own pack order.  A dog that would be dominant in one "pack" might be submissive in another ... it all depends on the individual dogs and how they perceive and react to one another.<br>  <br>  If you already had a strong "alpha" and knew she wouldn't tolerate another one, it would be obvious that you'd have to seek a very passive, submissive dog.  But that doesn't seem the case with the 2 you already have.  You've stated that your Lab-mix is submissive and your Aussie-mix is adaptable, so I think your options are fairly wide-open.  I think the only way you could go wrong would be to FORCE a clearly-dominant dog into the mix.<br>  <br>  Now ... Sounds to me like the humans in the pack would prefer a fairly calm, quiet, easy-going dog with a sweet temperament, who is playful at times but not boisterous, pushy, or overbearing.  Gentle enough to keep your Lab company and not threaten her confidence, but with enough spunkiness to hold its own with your Aussie.<br>  <br>  You didn't ask for breed suggestions (and I rarely like to give them) but if my perception of you and your "pack" sounds right (?), the first breed I'd be looking at is the Greyhound.  There are differences among individuals within the breed, of course, but the typical Grey temperament is go-along/get-along, so there are rarely conflicts with other dogs.|`|KxjUim7yaa	You need a dog that will be lower in the pack than Princess to keep up her self esteem. You need a submissive, yet friendly dog. Maybe take her while you are looking and get one that she likes.
u3Hdoeiqaa	Please don't use pine - I don't know if it causes health problems in reptiles, but it certainly does cause health problems (respiratory and liver disease) in rodents. Even feeder mice deserve to be kept in a healthy environment!    It is pretty difficult to tell if a female mouse is pregnant until she starts showing (without lab testing / scanning), although you could look for a vaginal plug. You can check the females daily, and may see a small whitish blockage... this doesn't always help though as the plug usually doesn't stay in very long.    All mice have a strong instinct to nest build - even males that don't have any females around. Don't worry if they don't start breeding immediately, some mice take a couple of weeks to "get to know eachother" first! If after a couple of months there is still no sign of pregnancy you may need to try a different male.    Just want to add I'm glad to hear you will be pre-killing, not live feeding! Just make sure you know exactly what you are doing (preferably practise on dead mice first) so you can do it humanely.|`|1LZdc4K5aa	Don't use pine bedding, this irritates their feet and may make them too uncomfortable to breed. Try using a cedar, or paper based hamster bedding. I wouldn't worry about them breeding though, it is extremely easy to breed mice. BTW, are you planning on keeping any pinkies, or feeding the snake pinkies (The tiny hairless babies)|`|5LGUb2rzaa	Good luck! It's a lot of work to breed your own rodent supply to support snakes. I've always been anti-live feedings unless absolutely necessary. Frozen thawed is much safer for snakes. But that's my soap box...    I would put the mice on carefresh but if you want a cheaper substrate, aspen would be safer then pine, since pine can be toxic to snakes, and I wouldn't risk it. As far as the pregnancy of mice, there isn't really any way to tell until the female gets really fat. They always make nests, even if there aren't any babies on the way. Just monitor it and separate the females when they get very chunky. Good luck!
Mcf33eLbaa	ROFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh my God OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not even close.    WOW you sure do come up with some pretty unique questions, lol.    Good Luck and God Bless|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Ok all you people saying    circumcision=removal of skin.    How about    Ear cropping=removal of skin    Huh? Huh? Right...    Look, docking is done at an age where the nervous system isn't even fully formed yet.  It is no big deal!  A dab of super glue adequately closes the teeny tiny cut.    I do *not* want to "go the way of the UK" and be FORCED to comply with MY property.  I can't believe you people are saying that!  You do realize how much BSL we have right now, right?  How much of our lives are you going to allow the governement to control?    If I want my dogs' tails docked...I will dock them.    If I want intact dogs...then I am going to have intact dogs!    If I own a cropped breed...you had better believe that their ears will be cropped.    I am a responsible adult.  Do not tell me what I can and can't do.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I think its fair. Both remove important body parts (the foreskin is not "excess skin"- it is highly errogenous genital tissue containing some of the most sensitive parts of the penis! Not to mention it causes the glans to go from being a moist sensitive organ like the vagina, to a keratinised dry one) Human circumcision is known to be highly painful to infants, and is often done with no anesthesia. Puppys get no anesthesia, although I'm unaware of pain studies. Both are done to prevent hypothetical "future" problems that MOST of the victims are highly unlikely to ever contract. (Most docked dogs do not work, so no working injuries, and the rate of otherwise uncurable foreskin troubles in men is suprisingly low- certainly under 20%- and probably under 1%- meaning if you cut 100 babies, at least 80, and as many as 99 of them will have gone through it for no benefit at all. -Neb|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Ha Ha,  I had to look up Fatuous.    1. Vacuously, smugly, and unconsciously foolish. 2. Delusive; unreal: fatuous hopes.3. idiotic    Now for my answer.  In my opinion equating dogs to humans is fatuous.      My 2 cents regarding docking.  Personally, I prefer natural tails. but if docking is done at 3 days old, before the pain receptors are fully developed.  I don't have a problem with it.  If done at a later date, where it becomes a full blown surgical procedure I don't agree with that, but I defer to the decisions of the owners to make that choice.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I don't think they are the same. I think tail docking is much worse!|`|okAYAGvXaa	Please give me a minute, gotta google "fatuous" :)))|`|3WzGf8tJaa	Both are unnecessary surgeries done on the very young without anesthesia.  Docking though actually involves amputation of an appendage.|`|ucr4J8kcaa	They are unrelated. I'd say spaying/neutering would be somewhat comparable.    To me tail docking is much crueler, and really has very little benefit to the dog unless they have an injured tail already. While circumcision seems to be a lot more convenient for the guy throughout their life.|`|Cn70dwABaa	Fatuous because the docking of a tail is less likely to effect the enjoyment of sex. In the dog world I'm sure that it would make it easier to get you end away if there wasn't a big tail in the way.    I watched a documentary about Jewish people paying to have their fore skin reconstructed and afterwards they said they enjoyed sex much more, including their jewish wifes,    But there is the question of whether the docking of a tail would prevent a dog adequately communicating with other dogs, that I cannot answer!    Both are un-necessary procedures nonetheless.|`|doBrNG47aa	I agree with the answerer that noted that circumcision has proven to prevent infection (though proper hygiene would suffice, I'd imagine).  Tail docking has absolutely no medical benefit at all.  It's a strictly cosmetic procedure done to meet breed standards in the US, and many veterinarians that I've worked with won't perform the surgery because they find it unethical.    I believe we should follow the UK and so many other European countries and make tail docking/ear cropping an illegal practice.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	In a way, but not really. Docking was originally done for safety regions, and circumcision is done for health reasons. I don't find anything wrong with docking, it is done while the dogs are incapable of feeling the procedure, so it cannot be considered cruel if they can't feel it.|`|AA11824922	Circumcision = Excess skin removal.  Docking = Excess spine removal.  In my opinion it is not fair to equate the two.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Dogs aren't people... hard to compare the two.    In the US, most human males are circumcised soon after birth (usually within a day or so).  After careful research, I opted not to circumcise my son (24 years ago) because the main historical reasons for doing it were not valid: cleanliness to avoid infection - we live in a land with an adequate water supply ~ religion isn't an issue for me... and I felt there was enough proof regarding sexual dysfunction due to circumcision that I didn't want to chance it.  I figured my son could do it if he felt moved to when he grew up.    Circumcision as a rite of passage  teenage male is common in some cultures.  Circumcision in human females HORRIFIES me... and is fraught with unimaginable medical risks.  Comparing that to tail docking is ludicrous in the extreme.    While I haven't been present during a tail docking I have done dewclaws on a LOT of pups... none have ever had an issue... all were far more upset over being removed from their mother than they were about the claw removal.  My friends with breeds that are docked tell me tail docking causes no more distress than removing dewclaws.    Personally, I find it hypocritical of people to espouse spaying/neutering while denigrating docking.  I find it interesting that some countries have outlawed spay/neuter unless it is a medical necessity.    But.. to sum it all up:    My Dog = My Choice|`|OWGBAiXtaa	Damn you, you evil UK woman with a large vocabulary!  You made me go to my dictionary to look up "fatuous", and I also had to go get my reading glasses to indulge your writing.  Anyway, for those who do not know what "fatuous" means, it's defined in my handy Random House College Dictionary as being  foolish, inane, silly,unreal,illusory.  It pretty much means "stupid"    It seems fair to me to equate human circumcision with tail docking.  In both cases, it's done without consent of the youngster, and it's done to conform with the beliefs of the adults in the situation.|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	You can't equate a religious rite with a canine conformation procedure.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	I don't equate human procedures to animal procedures.  It's a very Peta like thought process to compare humans and animals and I refuse to get on that band wagon.    But I can tell you that my boys are circumcised and I would dock and/or crop if I had a breed that required it to be done in the breed standard.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	I've yet to meet a guy who remembers being circumsized, and I've yet to meet a dog who needed a psychologist to help him deal with his emotional problems stemming from missing his tail. My parents used to breed Rottweilers...none of them held a grudge against us or the vet for docking their tails...|`|AA12128656	no....  tail docking doesn't prevent infection and has nothing to do with religion....    i prefer them "uncut"    tails, i mean.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its fair. The only difference is there is no reason to circumcise your child beyond religious or an actual medical reason like a foreskin that won't retract.    Of course I see nothing wrong with tail docking. It does serve an actual purpose and in main cases saves the dog and owner pain and a costly trip to the vet for a surgery and tail amputation.|`|cETQuE9waa	In my opinion it is no one else's business what you do. It is your choice whether to dock or not. And it is the choice of the parent/parents whether they want their baby circumcised or not.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I actually think it is a fair to compare the two. They each have their place in certain situations, but I think in general both are unnecessary.    If you live in an area that has poor hygiene and no proper way to clean yourself OR if your religion dictates that it should be removed than I can understand circumcision. Otherwise I think it is purely cosmetic.    If you have a working dog who's tail would inhibit it from doing it's job or if there is some medical reason for it, then I can understand tail docking. Otherwise it is purely cosmetic.    Both are done shortly after birth and they are both said 'to cause minimal amount of pain' because they no longer remember the pain following the cut.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Well, taking the religious reasons for circumcision out of the equation as not everyone circumcises for religious reasons - they could be considered similar.  Both are mostly unnecessary procedures carried out for convenience and aesthetics, occasionally it is medically necessary.    Hopefully as the human race evolves further these types of unnecessary procedures will be phased out.    I am not an animal activist I just don't believe in putting myself, my family or my pets through unnecessary medical procedures that have no health purposes, this includes spaying and neutering, ear cropping, tail docking, circumcision, cosmetic surgery, etc.|`|XEbe4Votaa	Well, both are done with a purpose.      Tail docking is done to prevent serious and extremely painful injury for the dog as an adult.  Many dogs who do not get their tails docked end up having to have them amputated later in life because of sever injury.    Circumcision is done for the purpose of cleanliness and sometimes health.  Circumcised men are less likely to get UTI's, penile cancer, and to contract STD's.  Sometimes, problems will result in surgeries to either remove or alter the foreskin in uncircumcised adult males.    Sounds to me like they're awfully similar.  Both are done very early in life, neither is likely to be remembered, and both serve a purpose of protecting the individual from future harm.    I personally find circumcision to be the more unnecessary of the two, but I can't say I have the much experience with it - as opposed to canine tail problems which I am very familiar with.      Add:  Clearly anyone who says docking tails is unnecessary for non-working dogs, or who says it serves no purpose at all is exceptionally mis-informed.  Many, many undocked dogs end up splitting their tails open and causing themselves great pain...whether it be in a crate, on the wall, playing outside...any dog with a whip-like tail is prone to this.  I've even seen golden retrievers have to have the end of their tail amputated because it was constantly splitting.  Do you have any idea what a mess a bleeding, wagging tail makes?|`|wuwUHukwaa	I don't see the sense in either unless it is medically beneficial.|`|vPde97E2aa	Humans are not dogs.    The only *possible* comparison between the procedures is that NEITHER is "cruel" "traumatic" or "mutilation"....or whatever other cry-baby buzz-word the AR-brainwashed spew.    Make I inquire as to why you are giving them yet another pulpit on which to do so?|`|Bw18seFqaa	I dont think its quite the same.      Human circumcision was originally done for religious purposes.. there are (argumentibly) some hygenic reasons behind it as well....  There are people who will tell you that uncircumicized men are at less risk for certain infections, stating that the foreskin helps prevent foreign bacteria from entering thru the urethra.  There are arguments on both sides of the fence regarding whether its healthier or not..    Only the parent can decide if they feel it is beneficial to circumcize or not (an uncircumcized male can always get circumcized later in life if he chooses to do so tho, but there is less pain and risk of infection if done early)       Tail docking was originally done to prevent tail injuries in working dogs.  Its far less painful to dock at a young age than to have the dog injure his tail later while working as an adult..   the tail injury itself is painful, and there are risks with surgury and infection and pain to amputate the injured tail as well..  while a purposly docked tail is less painful and heals much faster, putting the pup at less risk for infection.  In today's world, docking is mostly done for appearance and out of vanity..  few docked dogs are actually working dogs.  Tail docking should really only be done if the pups have the potential to be working dogs and at risk for tail injuries.. otherwise there is NO medical reason behind it.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Fatuous.    Circumcision: Removal of skin.  Docking: Removal of an extension of the spine that involves flesh, muscle, and bone.    However, I don't agree with either for the most part.    Darksong~

They know what is happening and grieve like we do.  You don't have to buy another parakeet unless you really want to.  He will probably bond very close to you now that his mate has died.  He will start chirping soon.  Be patient and give him time.  Give him lots of love and attention, too.|`|5Sr0HtFHaa	Omg im so sorry to hear i read your questions yesterday. I would buy him a girlfriend because budgies do get very lonely. I have a boy and a girl. And when i take the boy out the girl goes crazy and chirps like crazy and thats only 5 minutes.|`|vaulPrAmaa	lonely - he misses his only friend.  get another bird (not male) that he'll get along with.  either that or get rid of him..  keeping him alone is, im sorry, cruel|`|uIk9MAnDaa	that happened to me i had angel and roxie and angel died and roxie would not eat for a while what i did was got another parakeet named billabong and now she eats and drinks and they are both very happy together|`|psqkf6rMaa	try getting him a friend try a nanday conure ive heard they can hang out|`|vbEkYH2haa	So sorry June died :(    You must quarantine the new bird from your boy. i answered in your other question on how to do it. There is every possibility that June died of a disease, virus or bacteria that is still active in the environment or even in his body. Quarantine will prevent the spread of this.
TJGje2blaa	It's the Leash thing.  When she's home, put the leash on her & just drop it and let her drag it around with her.  Do this every day until she accepts it being on her.  You can usually tell by picking up the other end & see if she'll gladly follow you; if not, keep  letting her drag it around until she does.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	She's being a little stubborn.  Get a squeaky toy to take with you on walks.  Instead of tugging her, squeak a bit and get her attention on you.  Every now and then, stop and play with her and her toy for a few.  Walks are to be enjoyed.|`|WWnkLkqqaa	try walking her with her favourite treat in your hand and let her see it. she will soon follow you. Also try and make it exciting for her, it will keep her interested.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Walks should be short at this age.  Also be careful about taking her on public sidewalks etc. at this age.  Until she's had all her puppy vaccinations completed, she is still susceptible to viruses.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Just pull her along.  She'll eventually start walking.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	How long has she been walking for when she sits down? At 13 weeks she won't be able to have long walks.<br>  <br>  Don't drag her whatever you do - you would only be teaching her that being on a lead is an unpleasant thing and you could make a problem worse.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Here's a great list!  You didn't mention whether it was a Syrian (teddy bear, golden, panda) or a dwarf hamster.  If it is a dwarf, you need to be extra careful about not only human foods (see the note below) but also the store bought honey treats and yogurt drops - they should be avoided for dwarfs.  Otherwise, if it's a Syrian, anything on the list below is safe, and they'll love it!    Any time you introduce a new food to your pet, do it in very small amounts, only feed it once and see how their little tummy handles it.  Some hamsters do better than others with certain foods, but with a little time you'll come up with a snack list that your hamster will love - and that will give them the extra nutrients they may not get from their daily food mix or lab blocks!    Note: Because dwarf hamsters are somewhat prone to diabetes, it is prudent to avoid much sugar in their diet, so avoid fruits as treats for dwarf hamsters. Items with *** should not be given to dwarf hamsters!      Some suggested fruits and vegetables:    *** apples (no seeds!)  *** bananas  *** blueberries  * broccoli  * carrots  * cauliflower  * cucumber  * dandelions greens  *** grapes  * kale  *** peas  * potato (cooked)  * romaine lettuce - not iceberg  * spinach  *** strawberries  *** sweet potato  * squash    Other treats:    * hay   * whole grain bread or toast  * whole wheat pasta (cooked)  * brown rice (cooked)  * whole grain cereal (no sugary cereal)  * meal worms  * crickets or  * small pieces of cooked chicken  * bit of hard boiled eggs  * nuts (no almonds; unsalted) - in moderation  * unsalted peanuts - in moderation  * pumpkin seeds  * lentils  * sunflower seeds - in moderation  * plain air popped popcorn (no butter or salt!)    What to Avoid    * celery (the fiber strings can choke them)  * raw beans  * raw potatoes  * almonds  * citrus fruit  * garlic  * onions  * rhubarb leaves or raw rhubarb  * chocolate  * any sugary or salty foods  * any junk food|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Strawberries are great to give your hamsters. They love those so much. Be sure to cut of the green stem and to wash the strawberry with water before you give it to your hamster.    Hamster's normally eat the little seeds that are on the strawberries but they eat the whole strawberry too.    Carrots are not good to give your hamster because after you feed them the carrot they will think that your finger is a carrot and start biting your finger.    Good Luck!|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Carrots, cabbage, celery.  Dont give them too much.|`|AA10766729	Greens, nuts (unsalted), air-popcorn, cooked rice & pasta (both in VERY small quantities ... more like a treat), fruits (again in moderation), a little bit of cheese.  I make my hamster a little "salad" daily while I'm making one for myself.  She especially loves broccoli!    Hamsters are pretty finicky.  They'll only eat it if they want it, so give things a try and see what appeals.|`|YZYhgvA7aa	Raw carrots and potatos|`|Y4pfVX10aa	fruits and veggies bit stick to lettuce carrots and like apples and things and my hamsters love cheese.....|`|T7ebpbg1aa	try carrots and celery|`|JSrm2z2kaa	nuts haha thats what i used to give my hamster but not a lot and i did it about every two three days and only gave her two to three big ones or about 4 small ones.  also dried bananas.. my hamster loved those lol..  other than that i just fed her hamster food.  my hamter was alive 3 years so i don't think what i fed her was bad lol..  :D|`|uLEKUQUvaa	vegetabls and fruits-carrots,apple,celery,brocolli,let... something like those  oh yeah oranges
u3Hdoeiqaa	1) No - guinea pigs don't really smell. But like all animals their cage will start to stink if you use a crap bedding (eg newspaper is awful) or do not clean them out often enough.     2) Depends what you mean by friendly. Guinea pigs are naturally shy animals, and virtually all wil run away when you try to catch them. With regular gentle handling they can become quite friendly though and enjoy sitting on your lap. They are quite vocal too - my pigs always wheek at me when they want their veggies!    3) A lot harder than most people realise, but not too bad. They do need a large cage (at least 7.5 - 8 sq feet) which needs regular cleaning out, quality pellets, unlimited grass hay, a variety of veggies every day, floor time and cuddles, a hidey house and toys....     4) At least two. Guinea pgis are a social species and need the company of their own kind. They should never be housed alone as this is very stressful for them, and is known to cause a wide variety of health and welfare problems. You should adopt a same sex pair (either 2 males or 2 females) or you may be able to find a bonded pair that is one female with one neutered male.  (Also - it is a MYTH that males will fight - it just depends on the personalities of the pigs, if they have enough space etc.)    For the best guinea pig info check out:  http://www.guineapigcages.com/  (Especially read all the "sticky" threads in the forum)  http://www.guinealynx.info/  http://www.cavyspirit.com/    Hope this helps|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	They absolutely so not stink, If there is an smell it is do to human lazies, which sadly caused shame  to the guinea pig.    They are the sweetest  little animals in the would if properly cared for.     Absolutely  no they are not hard to care for they do take a lot to time.    I have had many companion guinea pigs which means i only had one and they were very happy. they were very loving playful there was no end to the joy that they bought to me. If you would like to communicate more about companion guinea pigs carolmoore30@yahoo.com|`|yvWI1u28aa	1. any animal smells if you dont clean it out often enough- you would! but if you clean them out twice a week then no, because unlike other rodents they have odourless urine =)  2. they're naturally timid, but with TLC and plenty of handing they become soooo tame!! One of mine runs up squeaking whenever I walk past!  2. Nope. Clean them out. feed them. give them water. a cuddle a few times a week and ta-da!  4. ATLEAST 2! guinea pigs are social animals and pine away without company. the live in groups in the wild, so 2 isnt perect but it will do. they like to have someone to chat to in their own language, eat with them, sleep with them and just generally keep them company. if you get a lonesome guinea pig, even with cuddles every day and talking, nohing can replace the memory of compnay of their own kind, after all, you're not the same species! some piggies just dont get on in pairs- if you want a single piggy, get one from a rescue like www.cottontails-rescue.org.uk and that way you wont feel guily depriving them of campany =)    x|`|c6nZXqglaa	1. Alot if you neglect their cage or if you dont clean themselves.  2. Very if you dont neglect them!  3. Depends on what kind of guinea pig  4. if you cant be with them that often then get another one to keep them company!  I have had 2 guinea pigs before|`|oFTbqICiaa	1.) they do smell a little, but you will get used to it.    2.) very friendly. very social animals who need lots of attention and love.    3.) not really. just feed it, clean its cage, and play with it.    4.) i have one guinea pig, but if you get 2 that is fine. if you dont have 2 though you must play with your guinea pig A TON!!!|`|cXK9sY1raa	1) Only if you don't clean them out often enough,  2) Yes, providing you are gentle and patient with them, they are not naturally aggressive.  3) They provide the same level of care and commitment as any other pet. They need shelter, warmth, plenty of exercise and room, food and fresh water, plenty of fresh veg every day, and attention.  4) They are group animals and you should always try to keep at least two. If you keep them singularly, you must give them lots of love and attention, as they can become very miserable without company. Pigs kepts in groups are happier and more secure.|`|lBXeGEI5aa	1. Somewhat stinky, but not as bad as ferrets or some other rodents  2 Very friendly! Mine will come to the front of the cage when i walk in the room!  3. Not at all! I take my with me on vacations! Just duct tape the cage to your car floor.   4. You can keep them by themselves, but its more fun with 2!|`|IFvj22PDaa	1. Only if you dont clean the cage for a while...  2. Yes, :) they are soo cute and nice  3.No   4. I would get 2
oWkHfqOUaa	Well dogs i totally agree with you, they are the best animals in the world, and they ARE the nicest animals ever, and as for goats, i don't know, ive never really been around one long enough to know, but i do like them..They are coool|`|psqkf6rMaa	dogs are nice but ive never met a goat they seem nice|`|vaulPrAmaa	horses|`|uicbw4Eeaa	dogs yea goats i do not know about them lol|`|g2Jr6zGKaa	YES, THEY ARE COOL!|`|ABJPBIH9aa	dogs are cool!

GpiRaSvPaa	I definitely understand your frustration in this situation. I too am an APBT owner and I too love these breeds, but also like you, I know that these breeds are NOT for everyone! Even though APBTs have tons of wonderful qualities, how a puppy/dog of ANY breed turns out is ultimately up to the owner (well, and the breeder has to make sure their pups are well bred, but that's a whole different conversation). It is up to the owner to make sure they have done the proper research on their dogs breed, and to make sure they get a dog/breed that are are willing and able to properly raise, train, socialize and control. Even a well bred Lab can be aggressive with people and other animals if it hasn't been properly raised, trained, socialized and controlled. I know that for a fact because I was attacked by a Lab, my brother was attacked by a Lab, my neighbors, when I was growing up, owned a  Lab that attacked 5 people (including children) before he was put down, and most recently our APBT, Brooklyn, was attacked in our own yard by our ex-neighbors Lab/Shepherd mix! With every single dog, regardless of breed, it is all on the owner to make sure the dog is properly raised, trained, socialized and controlled!     Now, as for your cousin, I would suggest you make a list for him of what his daily routine will be like if he really does go get an APBT, including what it will be like to help the puppy get adjusted and feel comfortable in his new home, what he will have to do, exactly, to house break his puppy, what he will have to do to train his puppy, etc. Also, add up the expenses so he can see how much work and money owning a dog truly is. As an example, here is our daily routine and our expenses (as I said, currently we just own 1 APBT).    When we first got Brooklyn, we bought him from a reputable APBT breeder for about $800. We also had to go out and buy him all of the stuff he needed... Collar - $15.00, ID tag - $3.00, Leash - $20.00, Crate - $60.00, Bed for in the crate - $30.00, Water and food bowls - $12.00, Puppy shampoo - $10.00, Treats (for training, etc.) - $10.00, Bones (have to have at least 1 bone) - $6.00, Toys (APBTs have to have their rope toys and Kong toys! lol!) - $20.00, Food (good quality dog food, we feed Canidae grain free ALS) - $30.00    And as you know, that's just the basics. After all of that we had to get him into the vet for his first check-up and to make sure he's up-to-date on all puppy shots, make sure he's been properly de-wormed, etc, etc, etc. So, the day after we got Brooklyn we took him to his new vet... Vet visit (just the visit!) - $60.00,  Flea and tick stuff (6 months of Frontline) - $60.00, Heart worm stuff  (6 months of Heartgard Plus)- $40.00    So, after buying Brooklyn, taking him to the vet and buying him all of the basic stuff he needed, we ended up paying almost $1,200 in 2 days! And that's just to get everything started. After paying all of that, we have to pay that $60.00 for all of his regular vet check-ups and $90.00 to get into the vet for an emergency visit. We have to buy him more Frontline at $60.00 every 6 months, more Heartgard at $40.00 every 6 months, we have to buy him another $30.00 bag of Canidae every week. He needs new shampoo when he runs out, we had to buy him a bigger collar, leash, food dish and water dish as he got bigger, he needs new bones, treats and toys every now and then, etc, etc, etc.     And now  to get to the fun part, our daily schedule...    -7am: Get up and take Brooklyn out to go potty. For this, we wake up at 7am, let Brooklyn out of his crate, get his leash on him, let him get some water real quick and then walk him straight outside. After he does his thing we bring him back in and take him off his leash.  -8am: We feed Brooklyn his first meal and give him fresh water for the day (every day he gets fresh water).  -8:30am: We take his food bowl up. We have a set amount that we feed him at each meal and instead of just leaving a bowl of food down 24/7, he knows he needs to eat what he wants (which is always all of it.. lol) in his 30 minutes.  -9:30am: We take Brooklyn out to go potty and then for his morning walk. We only allow Brooklyn to poop in our back yard, that way we don't have to carry poop around on our walks and it's all in the same general area so it's easier to clean up. We do, however, carry bags with us on our walks just in case. Anyway, we let him do his thing and then go for our morning walk. And his morning walk is about 30-45 minutes.  -3:00pm: We take Brooklyn for his afternoon walk. Again, we take him out back first to see if he needs to go potty and then we take him for a 30-45 minute walk.  -8:00pm: Brooklyn gets his second meal. Same thing as his first meal, we give him his set amount of food and 30 minutes to eat it.  -8:30pm: We take up Brooklyn's bowl for the day.  -9:30pm: Bed time walk. We take Brooklyn out to go potty and after that we take him for the last walk of the day. And for his bedtime walk, because it's cooler outside and we want him to get nice and sleepy for bed, we walk him for a hour.    So, that is basically our everyday schedule. We also take Brooklyn outside throughout the day for additional potty breaks if he needs them, but those are all of the major things. We do also try to take him to the beach a few times a week, at least for a nice walk on the beach, if not to actually take some time to play around in the water. And we take him to the park, the dog park, family and friends homes, the pet store, etc, etc, etc as often as possible. Just so he can get out and see new people and other animals because as I'm sure you know, you don't just stop trying to socialize your dog/puppy at a certain point. It is important that you make sure your dog/puppy is around as many new people and animals as possible, throughout their whole lives.|`|ZhttnYsEaa	try to make him want a cat or hamster an easer animal to look after and go on about a cat or a hamster saying all the cool things you can do with them and say that cats are soo much better than a dog (but you dont think that lol) but just tell him that beause cats can look after themselfs and dogs need humans there to look after them because they can not do it themselfs lol good luck x:)     P.S  your dog looks really cute|`|MYa0AIN1aa	"Pit bulls" are dogs. Nothing more. Nothing less. They actually aren't even a breed. When saying "pit bull" you actually mean a range of over 15 different breeds of dogs. Yes, a bully breed needs a strong authority figure, but so does every dog. I don't treat my American Staffordshire Terrier like a dangerous dog and he doesn't act like one. I don't think your cousin should have a dog at all. My brother got our AmStaff because it would make him look "tough" and we ended up taking him in because he didn't live up to his threatening potential. Any person that gets rid of their dogs for something so trivial, or at all, doesn't deserve one. Tell him that if he gets a dog you'll take it away or something. Convince him by showing him other animals that would suit him better. Or just let him play with your dogs a lot. I hope this helps. *But I don't really understand you're last sentence....What do you mean "much less a pit bull"? *|`|AA12128656	ask the local dog pound if they will loan you the most destructive, unruly, energetic pit bull they know.    i bet he won't keep it a week.    make sure it's got extra bad separation anxiety.    no- seriously, i don't know... that's a toughie. maybe you could tell him some horror stories... i could give you a few, like allie, the one who ate the WHOLE pillow top off my mattress, or Amber, the one who busts through windows and then tries to eat the side of the house... she also used to eat through walls to try to catch mice.  (both of these dogs were retrained by me, but you don't have to mention that part...)|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Just the fact that he want to "look cool" owning one he should not have one, they are a big responsibility, they are strong dogs that need training, and a leader of the pack.|`|Cp4lr0lAaa	Honestly all you can do is continue speaking to him about it. The choice is up to him sadly. If he does in fact get a pit you must be there to make sure he trains the dog right. I know it's hard to watch an own thats not fit get a dog thats not suited for their type of care. But again sadly the choice is up to him. All you can do is offer your thoughts and worries and be there if he does in fact get the dog.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	if he only wants a pitbull beacuse it will make him look cool then he should definalty not be allowed to have one unless he is gonna take proper care of it then he should get one but it is really up to him|`|uX5hO3d8aa	Find a similar breed for him, like an American bulldog. Most bulldogs are quite lazy and are supposed to be more people friendly than pit bulls. They also have the same kind of stance and coloration that can be found on most pit bulls and are known for being a bit smarter while still looking badass and having a badass reputation.    Pit bulls are known for being uncontrollable and temperamental and I even had a friend who's loving pit bull of 6 years freaked out and bit him in the face after he held the dog down so it couldn't attack someone it perceived as trespassing (my friend's girlfriend). They're loyal, energetic dogs but will turn on you if it feels it's in your best interest and if you're not able to control them people can get hurt.    So show him some pictures of American bulldogs and tell him you think it'll be a better match.
UPTu7uIVaa	I was unaware that cats were not supposed to have tomatoes.  I'm sorry I can't answer your question but am glad I could learn from it.  I searched tomatoes poisonous to cats and came across this Iams ad, which clearly shows tomatoes as what is supposedly in their food, and lists dried tomatoes as an ingredient!  That seems pretty crazy to me, I saw many websites stating tomatoes were bad for cats in my search.  I hope your kitties will be ok!|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Cat will be fine!|`|t2LOcPkLaa	i think they'll be fine. don't they put vegetables in cat food anyways?|`|q9qWHXcLaa	please don't worry Iwould only sorta worry if the ate a whole big tomato cause of extra acid but a bit of a peel thier fine don't worry just in the future keep food out of reach|`|9dlRcS7caa	I think they'll be okay. Just be careful in the near future. But if you are still unsatisfied, you can consult a Vet.|`|t1OIcAG3aa	don't worry, if she's okay now then she probably will be okay.  what you should do is obviously call your vet and ask what to do.  i know they say tomatoes can kill cats, but they also say chocolate can kill dogs and my friends dog once ate a chocolate bar and was fine.  i don't think it's a black and white thing.  so, just call your vet.|`|Spycl8Ikaa	um duh they will be ok.
1dG0XlWNaa	Some really good answers so far.  Good for you, getting exercise for you young dog, and dealing with her emotions.     I don't know anything about dog treadmills, but I did have to get my dog down from a high fire-lookout tower when my b-f couldn't. Dog  could See Through the wire-mesh steps -- and who know how sturdy Those Things Are? Thank CC we had been practicing heeling. I heeled him and kept going at first landing and turn. And we wound up safely on the ground!  Walk along side her on the floor, at least for a while. Stay within close sight, easy sight in front of her: Who wants to be left on treadmill while you're doing something that might be more fun?  I also don't know if bulldogs are into fetching. No idea. Seems v. likely that best exercise for both of you, and best bond-strengthening activity, is walking, running, playing Together.|`|0OZSkiYQaa	hold a treat in front of the treadmill and she'll have to get the treat which will make her walk on the treadmill|`|S5Lz35myaa	A treadmill is a great thing for a dog, but can be a little scary to the dog in the beginning.    Walk her, on leash, up to the treadmill, but not actually on it.  If she's okay standing next to it, then the next time, walk her on leash and keep on walking until she is actually on the treadmill, but do not turn it on.  do this a couple of times until she is very comfortable just walking up on the belt.  When she's okay with that, turn on the treadmill, but at the absolute lowest height level and the lowest speed.  Let her get used to it a little at a time.  You don't want to run a dog for a long time on the treadmill, a nice, easy walking pace is more beneficial to the dog.  Just take it slow and easy, gradual introduction, and she'll be fine.|`|WnpaPlz2aa	well a treadmill is not always the answer for this. what does she get out of it except for being tired? there is no prize at the end of her running except a treat or a praise from you. try getting like a teeball bat and a tennis ball and take her out to a field or a park and play a game of pitch and fetch. you hit the ball and she runs after it and brings it back. you could do it in your back yard if its big enough...also buy her a kong (the big red rubbish toys) and when you get home give her that and let her chew on it for as long as she wants. then when you go to bed take it from her and next time you take her out to play ball again do it again. make it a routine for her but a fun one.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	put the treadmill on very slow and give her treats when she goes on it and then she make it a lil bit faster (do it gradually though) and just keep sayin good girl and keep giving her treats
XbmZu0zKaa	it's nothing to worry about,one of mine does the same thing.i think it's to help them breathe better by keeping their mouth slightly open.|`|VVrMSqGFaa	Maybe he is have trouble breathing.|`|fb5ac5faab424efb3d1e35f8fd315050aa	Some cats suck their tongue at and early age and some times they do it throughout their adulthood, don't worry it's nothing wrong with him.|`|QGyYiEgZaa	I think it's just to help him breath better while he is asleep  My cat does that aswell, it's nothing serious|`|JVMw3Ivdaa	My cat does it too.

Your kitty is perfectly fine! ^_~|`|wxRPKEeYaa	Some cats do that. My cats do it when they're hot. It's completely normal. I wouldn't worry that your cat is sick.
vbEkYH2haa	If the air temperature is warm enough that the parents don't need to keep the babies warm, then there is nothing wrong.     For now, just keep a close eye and make sure all the babies are being fed and thriving, if they start to go down hill then you will need to start feeding them.    Would be a good idea to go out and get a quality hand rearing formula and pro biotic, some syringes (no needle) etc in preparation.|`|LfNaScTJaa	Cockatiels will give their last feed to the babies  for the night between 3pm and 5pm usually. To make things easier try giving some fresh corn on the cob and other veg and fruits that they like around 2pm.. It would be advisable to boost the amount of protein that the birds get. Example add extra plain canary to their mix. A higher protein mix will benefit the young in their growth pattern. Cockatiels can raise an average of 5 to 7 babies comfortably. I had a friend who had 1 pair raise 11 chicks in the one nest. All did very well and survived to grow into healthy adults. Crop feeding is an alternative for feeding young. You need a crop needle and syringe, but it is best to have someone to teach you how to do it. Feeding off a spoon that has been squeezed together at the front in the shape of a parrot beak or just using a syringe by itself and feeding slowly to the beak is probably your best and safest bet for you at this stage. As the young get older and there is more heat in the nest, the parents will stay out for longer periods of time. Keep a close watch on how dirty the nest gets. You may have to give clean bedding a couple of times a week. If you check your babies crops at around five they should be full. That feed is meant to last them all night until they get their first feed at daylight. Always make sure there is good quality seed mixture available at all times. When feeding the young by hand you will need to let their crops be almost empty before you top them up. Don't top them up if they have more than quarter full in their crop. This could cause something similar to a sourcrop. The crop needs to be close to empty before feeding.
Mcf33eLbaa	This could be many things from her having a blockage in her intestines to something simple like stomach virus.  Go to the vet and have her checked out as it could be something serious.

L22hVXTIaa	I don't mean to be rude, but you sound more upset about your furnishings and the work you had to do than your poor dog who is obviously ill.  Glad to hear you taking her to the vet.  But, get a grip.  Everyone who has pets has had to do their fair share of clean up after their dogs, cats, horses or whatever.  It goes with the territory.  Your poor dog is suffering with some sort of digestive tract problem and that should be your primary concern.  I really do hope all goes well at the vet and that your dog gets well soon.
Apisf1gAaa	It sounds like they're just de-stressing.  It sounds exactly like the 5 hermit crabs I have.  They were active for about a week, then have been underground since, coming up sparingly (when they think I'm not awake), then going right back down.  And I've had them for a little over a month.  This is the theory I've come up with: They're active the first week because it's new surroundings, better surroundings then they've been given at the pet store, and so spend the first week exploring.  Then, once they're done exploring, they go under to de-stress.|`|zBltsAXsaa	probably hibernating|`|r0u26SYGaa	try offering more water and mist them more often. i have 14 and only 2 were out, but when i started misting more, all except 3 came out and are still out!  good luck!|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	What kind of substrate are you using. Certain materials like Cedar or Pine will cause the hermit crabs to have migraines or brain damage.    How is the temperature in their habitat?  If it's too cold they might be trying to hibernate.
gSaf9T5gaa	I remember paying $2 for a rabies shot and $18 to have the dog spayed.  I don't know if that's any help to your daughter's math project but I did have another idea.  The vet I'm going to has been our family vet since 1984.  Before that, it was his Dad's practice.  Maybe you could check the phone book and call around to some of the vets and ask if any of them can remember.|`|3giaPYe8aa	The only thing that comes to mind to me is that my parents payed $30.00 to have our little female spayed in 1965.  I believe this fee included the Rabies Vaccination that, back them, was given to dogs at 6 months old, not like today at usually 16 weeks.  I don't remember how much an office visit was or booster vaccines, because back then, not that many people even bothered with any vaccines except Rabies.  I know I'm not the oldest poster on this site, but I guess I am showing my age. (53)  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  I was only 10 at the time.|`|MBFeHS22aa	Yes shots were $2. Neutering was $10 spay was $25.  A visit by the vet to the stable was $10 plus any work that was done such as shots.

3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I think it is just playing rough.  Mine get extremely rowdy and loud...and I think a lot of other people with no or little dog experience would think I'm running a Vick style dog-house.<br>  <br>  The biting the feet, nipping back legs, and growling is okay in play.  The humping is a dominant gesture as you know...and I usually make a verbal correction there before it gets out of hand.  As far as getting hurt...if it is just a yelp, don't worry much as they have communicated it has gone to far.  If one is pinned to the ground, continuously yelping, and/or blood is being drawn...then it is a fight.<br>  <br>  Cuddling is not necessarily indication if they like each other or not.  Mine rarely snuggle...but they get along great.|`|3SrW3LhIaa	I think they are playing.  I have a girl yorkie mix (13 lbs) and a boy lhasa (23 lbs). My boy is like you girl (laid back) and my girl is like your boy (very hyper and always instigates).  My dogs play very rough.  <br>  <br>  That is what dogs do though.  Have you ever seen them at the dog park.  It is insane.  And humans should not really get in the way unless they are in danger of hurting each other.  <br>  <br>  That being said.  Remember that dogs are animals and they know how to take care of themselves.  If neither one is yelping (high pitched scream), I bet they are just playing! <br>  <br>  Let it escalate until they stop or yelp and see what happens.  My dogs go and go.  The girl even looks aggressive, showing her teeth, etc. But the boy lets her do whatever she wants and then they just tire each other out and lay down and cuddle.  That is not really making up - they are just resting.  Then a few minutes or hours later they are back at it!!! <br>  <br>  We humans have to loosen up a little and remember: Even though we think of them as out children - THEY ARE NOT!  They are ANIMALS :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	This is normal.  Unless they are actually hurting each other, let them sort it out.<br>  <br>  These dogs are also getting out of their puppy stages, so it's like them being teenagers, establishing their place.  Just let it happen so long as no one is getting hurt.<br>  <br>  Add....Yelping and leaving marks isn't really hurt.  This happens in rough play.  As long as there is no blood, broken bones, my advice is to stop worrying so much.<br>  <br>  If your JRT really hated what your poodle is doing, remember, the JRT is bigger, and stronger, and can put the poodle in it's place.<br>  <br>  Dogs in the wild do this ALL THE TIME.<br>  <br>  If you are that worried, take your dogs to a dog behavior specialist and ask them all these questions.  They will tell you the same thing, only it's gonna cost you.  The third poster is right.  These are JUST animals, not children.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	it could be a bit of both
kWwgWSSgaa	A toy Poodle has a standard, a description of what the dog should like, which can be traced from the great grandparents, grandparents, parents ect to a current litter {family tree}. Purebred dogs like the Toy Poodle would consistently breed to the standard.    Toy Poodles are also registered with breed clubs at registries like the AKC and the UK Kennel Club.    Now micro/teacup Chihuahua's on the other hand are just undersized dogs, bred to fulfil a demand by people who undertake no/scant research. No responsible breeder would label their dogs teacup or micro Chihuahuas.|`|Qc0x3Ldaaa	Poodles come in different sizes and the "toy" poodle is a recognized breed of the AKC.  They are not runts that are bred to each other to make them smaller.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	The chi is in the toy dog group. It comes in ONE size.    But there are three recognized sizes for the poodle. None of them are "teacup"!! Standard, miniature, and toy.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle|`|f1bc84bbc8f80702f7871dd9f28476c0aa	I know, the only way a toy breed was made was by breeding the smaller dogs to one another, then they took those and finally recognized them, the same as how the tiny Chis are being done now, I predict that the smaller ones will eventually be recognized as a seperate size.  The only problem is that if the smaller ones health is not somehow improved then that will not happen, because you can not promote unhealthy dogs.    You can tell the difference in a runt from a dog that was bred to be small by looking at the parents.  If the parents are large and the pup is charting to be very small, it is a runt, if the parents are small and the pup is charting to be the same size, then it has just been bred to be small.  The parents of my chi are 4 lb dam and 2 1/2 lb sire, and she is charting at 3 lbs, so she is the correct size for her breeding.|`|C7X6PLTWaa	If you look at the AKC or UKC websites (the two main kennel registries in the US) you'll see Poodles, (and several other breeds) have different sizes, Toy, Miniature and Standard, however Chihuahua's don't have multiple "sizes. Also don't assume people are breeding under size runts to get a small dog. That is rarely the case (never the case with a GOOD breeder)    Chi's come in one size, however that size range is pretty broad as long as the dog is  6 pounds or under. So a 2lb chi, is still just a regular old Chihuahua.  So if someone is trying to sell you a toy or teacup chi for an outlandish price, you know they don't know anything about chi's and they're just after making a lot of money.    Who knows, one day in the future they might split the sizes, but I doubt it, there isn't a need to.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Because there is just one breed.  The chihuahua.  A teacup or mini chi is merely an underbred small chihuahua.  They are not a separate breed.  Toy poodles are already their own recognized breed and have an AKC standard written for them.  Chihuahuas are already small.  How much smaller should they be?  Anything under 4 lbs should not be bred as it is extremely unsafe for the b****.  So, people that are breeding these "teacups" are willing to have there dog DIE so they can make money.  That's the problem.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	By AKC standards, there are three types of Poodles: standard, miniature, and toy.    However, according to AKC, Chihuahuas come in only one size. So anyone breeding "miniature Chihuahuas" is going against AKC's standards.    There are breeds in which AKC recognizes multiple sizes, such as the Schnauzer (giant, standard, miniature), American Eskimo Dog (standard, miniature, toy), Beagles (13" and under, over 13" but under 15").|`|PM23RDycaa	As stated the Chihuahua comes in one size only and that's every other breed in the toy group as well.    Poodles, Schnauzers and American Eskimos come in three sizes. These sizes all serve a purpose as do the ACCEPTED mini versions of other breeds like the Dachshund - the standard was bred to hunt badgers the mini to go after smaller rodents.    Toy and Mini Poodles have years of careful and selective breeding in their backgrounds. A chihuahua should be under 6lbs that is what the standard says, a 'teacup' would still be in that range. Under 3lbs is really kind of pointless and unhealthy at best.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Toy poodle is a breed, just like the minuature schnauzer they come in toy, medium, and standard.|`|cETQuE9waa	Toy Poodle is an actual breed. Chihuahuas only come in one size.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	No a toy Poodle is just that, Poodles come in 3 sizes  Toy are up to 10 inches at shoulder in height and weigh 6-8 pounds  Minis are up to 15 inches and weigh 10-12 pounds   Standards are above 15 inches at shoulder and the tallest one I ever had was 29 inches they weigh in between 40 and 75 pounds.    Bad breeders try to promote teacup poodles which are the runts and are very sickly    I have been breeding Standard Poodles for 30+ yrs and have only ever had a few runts, they were spayed and neutered and sold to loving families|`|x8Vgu6acaa	The Toy Poodle is actually a breed recognized by AKC and all other legitimate registries.  There are actually 3 breeds of poodle, Toy, Miniature and Standard.  Each with its own breed designation and standard.  The same with Schnauzers, Giant, Standard and miniature. There are also other breeds with different size breeds.   Chihuahua comes only in one size.  There is no registry that differentiates sizes in chihuahuas, pomeranians, Yorkies, Maltese ect.  These are just labels trying to get more money for ill bred puppies.  There also in no breed with the Teacup, or micro-mini designation in any breed.    There is also no such thing as teacup poodle.
Tsjy6fu2aa	Our dog does the same thing. It didn't start till he was about a year old. Now he just sits around licking stuff. He'll lick our clothes, our hands, the wall.. Everything. There's nothing wrong.|`|6qsocyK3aa	I would deter her from doing that. I'm not purposely trying to scare you but my housemate used to have a dog that did that. It ended up with lots of stones, dust, etc., that it had licked up from the floor in the bottom of its stomach which killed it.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	She's just exploring.  Being a dog, that's all.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs lick to clean their tongue. They lick if there is something they can smell on the floor. They lick if there is something on their nose. They also can do this as a mini seizure activity.

Exercise her more, reinforce obedience training, teach her some tricks. Keep her mind busy and her body active.
rQlzfHqraa	Of course it just sits there. Passenger pigeons have been extinct for decades. If it is stuffed feed it some clean dry air and my 'any other tips' is to vacuum it very gently once and put it under a glass dome.|`|AA10626373	Assuming this ain't a joke, since as mentioned Passenger Pigeons are extinct and you are in fact referring to a homing pigeon, then make sure that it's got clean food (hard grain not vegetables) and clean water.  It might well have coccidiossis.  Sulfamethazine or Amprolium can be used in correct dosage as a cure.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	They need to eat a commercial mix supplemented with fruits and vegetables.  Some fruits they can eat are apples, pears, berries, and banana.  Some vegetables they can eat are peas, carrots, corn, broccoli, and spinich.  Pigeons need grit and gravel because they eat seeds whole.      If you just bought the bird, it needs time to adjust to its new surroundings.  Be patient and give it time.    Signs of illness in pigeons are laying on the bottom of the cage alot, sleeping too much, dirty vent, sloppy poop, fluffed up appearance, not singing, not being able to balance itself.  I suggest having an avian vet available in case the bird gets ill.
YdjX5fOWaa	I moved here a couple years ago from the country with my dog and it has been a wonderful experience for my dog.  I feel like he socializes much more with other dogs, since we see them much more frequently while we're walking.  There are all sorts of dog groups, events, etc that go on in the city.  I take my dog everywhere (except for the grocery store).  Most stores, banks, etc, have dog biscuits and water dishes.  Even a lot of restaurants with out door seating are accommodating to bringing my dog. I take him on the subway, bus, and taxis with ease (as long as he's in his carrier).  It's been great!  I actually feel like I spend more time with my dog now than I did before!|`|UH67GysTaa	Not too good. There isn't alot of space to run around, its unsafe to walk it.

You see people all of the time walking and jogging with their dogs.  They have lots of dog cafes!  And, Central Park!  But there are certain environments in New York City where I definitely wouldn't take a dog.  It all depends on where you are planning to keep the dog.|`|bqJZ0fwEaa	manhattan is actually quite dog friendly.  there are plentiful dog parks, friendly people, and tons and tons of pet friendly stores (not just pet stores either!).|`|GXM74MGPaa	Well. Its a very fast city. Lots of people. Im not sure what party of NYC your intrested in. But they do have many dog parks and regualr parks you can bring you dog.

WiycCxpzaa	Where did you see in Georgia it was illegal to gas? From what I recall when I went to apply at the Humane Society here in Georgia a few years ago, we had to go through this big tour of everything and even see them have to kill an animal. (A horrible horrible site, i realized then I didnt have the stomach or heart for that job). But there was a gas room for the dogs as well.<br>  <br>  I just looked this up, most places don't use it anymore, but it still happens and there are still gassing chambers in Georgia. <br>  <a href="http://www.animallawcoalition.com/gas-chambers/article/371" rel="nofollow">http://www.animallawcoalition.com/gas-ch...</a><br>  <br>  Also, you have to remember that people will give that type of info. on a dog that is about to die because it seems more dramatic and tugs at the heart strings more.|`|Bw18seFqaa	are you sure that shelter gasses?

DtkLsetkaa	Some ideas I have (and I am not a cat expert just read this forum a lot) is that either she got pregnant and he can tell, or she has another cats scent on her.  He might be territorial of her, and kinda feel like she is "his".  Maybe try giving her a bath to wash off any scents she might have picked up while outside, and I would definitely get her to a vet asap to check and make sure she isn't pregnant.  I hope it works out for you, good luck!!|`|FncFYplJaa	I'd check to see if Little Kitty is pregnant..  Two of my cats got "knocked up" while escaping from the house..  If your cat is pregnant, then you'll probably notice her tummy getting rounder and nipples getting bigger (full of milk) and pinker. Try to pick her up and check for that. And some cats, when pregnant, have a slight behavior change and they become calmer, friendlier, and sweeter.   While humans are pregnant for 6 months,   cats are for only 65 days.  You might want to bring her to a vet to see if she's pregnant.  (Feel free to contact me further if you find out that she is pregnant; I have experience with cats giving birth and such..)    Or maybe she just has other cats'  scents on her, and so Big Kitty is defensive or getting territorial.     Well, good luck.
3b6i9eiyaa	All animals make different sounds.  The faint whisper is the "silent meow".  The short and abrupt meow is an attention getter.  She apparently doesn't need any more sounds for you to notice her.    I don't believe there are degrees of muteness.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	Some cats are less vocal than others and have different vocals than others. Just like humans, cats have different voices and "talk" in different ways. There's probably nothing wrong with her, she just doesn't make a lot of noise. Its like when you see those people who speak softly versus people who speak loudly.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	I have a cat like that, too.  I've wondered the same thing.  Once, he was stuck behind the water heater all night and we searched for him for hours, calling his name (he jumped down there out of curiousity, I guess, then couldn't get out).  We finally found him when we heard him tapping on the wall - he wouldn't even meow properly then!  Sometimes people who are deaf don't develop their voice properly even though nothing is wrong with their vocal chords, so I thought perhaps he was deaf (he is white, also) but he definitely is not deaf.  The fact that he can and does produce tiny noises when he wants to would lead me to believe that he's not mute either, or else he wouldn't be able to produce any noise.  So, my conclusion is that he's just quiet, and doesn't like to talk much :P|`|aeNiPKRBaa	maybe shes a lil shy and soft spoken joke i had a kitty like this once the vet always said there was nothing wrong with him he was just not a vocal as others. let your vet check him out just in case though|`|GEV367kiaa	Some cats are very quiet and shy, while others want to be heard. This sounds normal.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Cats can hear and meow out of the human hearing range. It's quite possible she's actually shouting her head off, but most of it is too high pitched for you to hear. I had a cat who did squeaky, whispery meows a lot of the time, though she also used to make plenty of sounds I could hear fine, so I knew there was nothing wrong with her voice!  Apparently some cats who do it eventually learn to pitch their voice lower when speaking to humans!    If you are worried, check with the vet next time you go in for shots or whatever.  Or if it changes, or there's other symptoms, see them sooner.|`|VVrMSqGFaa	you should take her to the veterinarian
EJpiaCMQaa	Be patient, but consistent, in trying to get the budgies on your finger.  It took one of my budgies about 3 months to get on my finger, but he always hops on it now.  Patience and persistence pays off.  There really are no tricks needed to gain the trust of your birds.  If they are both already used to your hand being in the cage, it's only a matter of time before they jump on your finger.  Offering them some millet can help get them on your finger a little faster.|`|AA11510511	Try getting your finger and stroke their chest.

They have recently noticed that males who eat a lot of fish foods have more chance for UTI.    I rarely feed my cats fish (no fish cat food like tuna/salmon).  They get chicken, lamb, beef, venison or duck.  The fish they get is samples from our fish (talipia) that we cook for supper.    I would restrict fish canned food to once a week at the most.

PS. your cats are overweight.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Canned food is good for cats in that it has the moisture they need, so disregard "dry food is better" arguments.  It's utterly rediculous to think that eating dried out cereal is how cats were meant to be - their digestive system is meant to handle eating meat, which is moist.    Anyway, it's best to primarily feed meat and poultry and limit the fish.  Fish is very high in phosphorus, which is hard on the kidneys.  Since kidney failure is extremely common as cats get older, it's safer to not tax their kidneys too much while you can.  Read labels - sometimes food labeled as chicken or beef flavor, etc, has fish in it too.
AA11097657	It is very strange that being sisters they don't get on. You would have thought that they would have sorted out who was in charge as youngsters. I think it has alot to do with living away from you.    I have had many sisters in my last and present packs and they always get on fine.It is the ones who are not related that fight.    I always have a favourite out of my sisters are she gets all the training and attention.This helps to establish who is superior between them.  The fact that you keep them outside means that they don't have you as their pack leader and you haven't helped them by spoiling one and not the other.When you keep dogs inside your home then you are the pack leader and the dog you pay the most attention to becomes second in command.    You must chose one to spoil. Make sure you pick the right one though.  It must be the one that shows more dominance and won't back down.    Be confident in your control and have separate kennels if you have too.|`|DHuOGJnjaa	i didn't read the details but try taking em' to training classes. but put muzzles on em' only if you need to|`|WnpaPlz2aa	well i have raised both male and female and i would have to say that when i had to female dogs at the same time that if one or the other was not spayed they would get "aggresive" while one or the other or even both were in heat. i would get them spayed soon. not sure where people get the idea that its good for them to have a little of puppies first but get them spayed and your issue might go away. if not then they are competing for alpha dog.|`|6eaa0b61f602657500c8e4340d6b6bfeaa	I have three dogs, two male and one female, I have this combination because my vet said two females might or might not get on.  He said you never know, but he did say that ***** to ***** agression is the most common problem with combinations of dogs and that in most cases it starts out fine, but once they hit puperty they start to grumble and spat and then if it is not stopped it will get worse and worse and it is better to rehome as they can injure each other.  He said in all cases of ***** to ***** agression that he has seen it is extremely difficult to deal with, mostly impossible.    So if you really want to keep them as they are sisters it would be a shame to part them, maybe get some professional help.      I think having puppies would be a massive mistake.  Can you imagine what they would be like once their hormones changed they would be all over the place, then you run the risk of one harming or killing the others pups, it would be a nightmare, you would be so stressed, also nervous and agressive dogs should not be bred from, you do not want to breed from dogs with these behaviours at all.  This would be irresponsible breeding, added to aforementioned comments on why bring more puppies into the world anyway.    Seriously think about spaying, professional help or rehoming as a last resort.|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Just to let you know, if a dog ever bites you and it's really serious you have to take your dog to the vet and he/she has to be put to sleep (killed with a needle/shot)|`|mUed9bXYaa	could it have anything to do with them (the dogs) knowing that you're the owner and not him? all domesticated dogs were once wild and like wolves they are pack animals so they will only obey one master...|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Hey, congrats for wanting to bring more unwanted pups into this world.  What on earth is a muzzle?  Your need to repost with punctuation and in language that we can understand.  What on earth is "neautered"?|`|9kTejB0uaa	I can't get a grip on what you are saying here really!  If I'm right, you are asking how you can stop these two litter sisters from fighting?  Well I can tell you that when bitches decide to fight, and it's always worse with litter sisters because there is this dominance thing going on, it's always a lot more serious than when males fight.  Somebody once said bitches fight to survive, and males fight for a ******.  Hum.    In all truth, I can't see your girls living with muzzles on for their entire lives.  And if this has started, I think there is every chance of this only getting worse.  So you may be looking at rehome one of these girls unless they can live in your set up, being separated all the time.  Can't see this working.    As for the rest, are you saying you want to take a litter from each of these girls and then have them spayed?  If so, given their feisty natures, I think I'd have to ask whether you really want to risk passing this temperament on?  And remember, it's an old wives tale that every ****** needs to have a litter before being spayed.  More true is the fact that the more seasons a ****** has before being spayed, the more the risk is of her developing mammary/uterine cancer in later life.    So, rehome one, and get them spayed would be my, probably unwelcome, recommendation.   You could get them both spayed, and see whether the fighting situation improves first?|`|TJGje2blaa	Soap, water, Peroxide will handle the bite.  A good water pistol will take care of splitting them up when they're fighting.  If they're outside, the water hose works.
POmUFlGAaa	My vet said he likes to do them at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Vaccinations are given at 8, 12 & 16 weeks of age. (they should never be given under 8 weeks of age). No coronavirus ever for any dog/puppy. Lepto is only recommended for dogs/puppies taht are at high risk of exposure.|`|Bw18seFqaa	first shots are ussually around 8 weeks..  every 2-3 weeks after that..  they get 3-4 sets of shots total..  plus a rabies vaccine around 16 weeks.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Call the vet and ask. You should know when the first shots were given if possible. Usually the vet will want to see the pup before it is 6 months old.=|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Ask your dog's breeder.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	you can call your vet and ask but the breeder should of told you when you bought the puppy because normally you get told when they have the first shots|`|dRUgXlOLaa	When you get a puppy, most likely your veterinarian will recommend a series of three sets of vaccinations. These will generally be given at four week intervals starting at eight weeks of age. The first vaccine will most likely be referred to as "distemper." This is usually a combination shot that will protect your dog against distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, leptospirosis, and coronavirus.    1) Distemper -a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that is similar to measles in humans. It can affect dogs of all ages but is most often seen in unvaccinated puppies. It attacks the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and nervous systems. Symptoms include cough, nasal and eye discharge, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea. In advanced stages, dogs may show neurological problems such as lack of coordination, weakness, and seizures. Treatment includes fluids and antibiotics but prognosis is guarded and in about half of the cases, Distemper is fatal.    2) Hepatitis -which affects the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and the lining of blood vessels. It causes fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and lethargy. Treatment includes administration of fluids and antibiotics but in serious cases a blood transfusion may be necessary. The severity of the disease varies but young puppies often die from Hepatitis.     3) Parainfluenza - caused by a virus and is quite mild in comparison with other infectious diseases. Symptoms include sneezing, discharge from the eyes and nose, and coughing. Treatment varies but in many cases, no treatment is required.     4) Leptospirosis which is transmitted by contact with water contaminated with infected urine. It affects the urinary tract, kidneys, and liver. Symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, and abdominal pain. In further stages of the disease, dogs may become very thirsty and have a low temperature. Treatment includes antibiotics and fluid therapy. Please note however that some dogs are allergic to the leptospirosis vaccine. Please check with your veterinarian if you have questions or concerns. Oftentimes the leptospirosis component is not a part of your puppy shots and will be administered annually starting the next year your dog is due for vaccination.     5) Coronavirus which causes inflammation of the intestines and diarrhea. This disease most often affects puppies. Symptoms include decreased appetite, orange or yellow diarrhea, lethargy, and fever. Treatment includes fluid administration and antibiotics. Prognosis is usually good. The distemper combination vaccine is given annually after the first three series.    At your second visit (or at age 12 weeks), if you plan to take your dog to puppy class or he will be around other dogs, it is a good idea to get him vaccinated for Bordetella Bronchiseptica. Bordetella Bronchiseptica is most often referred to as Kennel Cough. This disease is incredibly infectious and is usually transmitted in areas where many dogs are together such as boarding facilities, doggy day care, and dog parks. If your dog becomes infected, you will notice a dry cough. Infected dogs are usually treated with antibiotics. Keep in mind that even though most places that take in multiple dogs require immunization to Bordetella, no vaccine is 100% effective so your dog may still become ill with this disease. This vaccine comes in both intranasal and injectible form. The intranasal form is dribbled into your dog's nostrils. Your dog may need a booster of the Bordetella vaccine at his 16 week visit and annually after that.    At age 16 weeks, your dog can be vaccinated for Rabies. Rabies is usually transmitted to dogs through saliva - most often in the form of a bite from an infected animal. Rabies affects all warm blooded animals but is most often found in bats, skunks, and raccoons. Rabies is always fatal. In many states, rabies vaccination is required by law. Check with your veterinarian on how often this immunization is recommended as protocols may vary. If your dog becomes infected with Rabies, you may notice subtle behavioral changes at first. This may be accompanied by fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. The best defense against Rabies is to make certain your dog is properly immunized.    By properly vaccinating your dog, you are helping to ensure both his safety and the safety of other pets and humans.|`|DHuOGJnjaa	i don't know. try asking your vet
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Yes, they make leashes. No, don't use them.    If you want to take your hammie outside with you, buy a playpen instead.  Check the ground area for anything dangerous before you put it in there, but then it can run around and enjoy the outdoors.    Please don't even take the hamster outside until you've had it at least a month, and never when it's under 70 degrees outside or the ground is in any way damp.    They're very delicate creatures and lower temps than that, or getting wet can and will kill them.    Balls are great for hamsters.  They LOVE them.  Just make sure you get a big ball for a Syrian or a small ball for a dwarf.    Limit your outside time with the hamster as well, they don't adjust well to change and are quite timid creatures and if they are scared, it will become harder to handle them.    Good luck!|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Yes!  You can find them at your local pet store but I wouldn't recommend them.  My hamster hated his and just ended up being a waste of money.  Google hamster leashes and a lot of interesting stuff will come up.|`|c6nZXqglaa	Yes they can have harnesses to fit any sized rodent! XD hope this helps!|`|VQM0ZpdKaa	Yes, there are such things as hamster leashes. Do not use them, the hamster might find it too tight and they die. Hamster balls are not meant for guinea pigs, but hamsters love them. I bought my hamster one at Wal-Mart and he loves it!|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	yes|`|mTJ8wTs3aa	Yes, there are leashes, but I would be careful about them. I tried mine with two different hamsters. They are a pain to get on, but one loved it. The other one hated it and wouldn't let me put it on him. It your hamster is not very comfortable with being held then don't buy it because your hamster won't let you put it on. Also make sure not to take your hamsters outside in them. They are fine for playing in around the house, but it is possible for the hamsters to escape from them. There is a standard harness type and a "vest" type. You can see an example of the latter at http://www.geocities.com/peaceluvspets20...    Someone else also mentioned a hamster playpen. DO NOT buy them unless the walls are over a foot high. I have one for my hamster and she can climb right over the walls. Also, if you use one outside you have to be careful because if it is on bumpy ground they can crawl right out from underneath.|`|3bZU42aWaa	yes there are at the pet i have a hamster myself|`|x0Z19HJGaa	The hamster might be terrified when you take him on a walk. Anything could squash him outside. I think they are happy in their cage with their cute little tubes and wheel. Maybe take him for a walk around the house or in the front yard.

AA12083992	You can feed raw meat however not raw meat only. Do some research on the foods you would need to feed to give your dog a balanced diet. Large breed pups do not need puppy food. In fact many think it can cause too rapid growth and problems with joints. Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

Dogs were made to digest raw meat and RAW bones(yes even poultry) and organs. Salmonella and E.coli which is hardly found in whole meats over ground will not affect a HEALTHY dog. Raw meat digests faster than kibble and even cooked meats. A dog is more likely to come in contact with these germs by way of tainted kibble and treats - recent peanut butter recall.    Gill - Would you feed yourself cereal everyday for the rest of your life for every meal? The human digestive track cannot handle raw meat any more a dog's can and always will. Selective breeding has change their appearance and bones structure NOT what goes on in their guts.    Does this look like an unhappy dog to anyone? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muuHxpMCL...

On the raw diet you can feed your dog any meat source under the sun as long as they like it and you can get your hands on some.    -    *  Whole Eggs      * Beef (any parts, except dense weight-bearing bones)      * Liver (any species)      * Kidney (any species)      * Green tripe      * Heart (any species)      * Spleen (any species)      * Sweetbreads (any species)      * Lung (any species)      * Whole rabbits (or parts)      * Chicken (whole or parts)      * Turkey (whole or parts)      * Quail      * Pheasant      * Duck      * Goose      * Pork      * Lamb      * Goat      * Deer      * Elk      * Bison      * Pronghorn antelope      * Ostrich      * Kangaroo      * Emu      * Whole fish (avoid fresh salmon)      * Canned fish (use sparingly)      * Rats      * Squirrels      * Mice      * Moose|`|AA10229248	Raw feeding is fine. Just be sure to do your research to make sure you're giving your dog the proper nutrients. I would suggest getting on a raw feeding e-list or at least picking up some raw feeding books.    I have huskies and I do a combination of dry kibble and raw feeding. They get Eagle Pack natural formula in the morning. In the evening they get half the amount of kibble and some raw meat. Or a raw egg. Or a mixture of meat and vegetables that have been stewing in a crock pot all day.    They also get raw meaty bones as a treat a couple times a week. And dehydrated or fresh vegetables instead of dog biscuits. Sometimes my grocery store even has fresh, raw pig's ears for sale in the meat department. I buy all they have and put them in a food dehydrator. That way the dogs get a special treat and there are no preservatives or chemicals added.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Talk to the dog's breeder when you purchase it.

You can even give them raw chicken, bones and all.  Chicken bones are only dangerous when they are cooked and become brittle.  It is just difficult to be sure that your dog is getting all of the nutrition that it needs when doing a raw diet, so you really have to educate yourself.  You could still give the dog some kibble of a very high quality in addition to the raw diet.  You can also add in vegetables, but grains are not really needed by dogs.  Do your research, all of the dog owners that I know who do agility or show feed raw diets.|`|DHuOGJnjaa	only raw beef. but you should cook it first. it can't hurt them much but raw pork and raw chicken is bad for a dog to eat.|`|TJGje2blaa	Dogs came from Wolves, & wolves are most definitly meat eaters.  Dogs are mostly carnivorous, meaning meat.  Raw Meat is the best you can give them.  If you can't afford to do it every day, a couple times a week would greatly benefit the dog.   When we were children, our hound dogs would go out into the woods at nighttime & catch their own meat.    I used to buy large, raw soup bones from the butcher & give to my collie, once or twice a week, & she always remained really healthy.  For a husky, I'd say do it at least 3 or 4 times a week, if not daily.   Also, I added just a drop or two of regular Bluing, that's used in laundry, to her water, so I didn't have to worry about bad worm infestation.  I'd also give her those big capsules every so often, whether she needed it or not.   If you use Bluing, make sure it's just a tiny bit.|`|pBA8nzfNaa	No it is not okay to feed raw meat.  Please just stick with a regular puppy food.  When looking for a puppy food it should be one that your puppy likes, a commercial dog food (such as purina, science diet, iams, any major brand really), one you can afford at a place wich is convient for you to go and buy it.  The big dog food companies spend millions of dollard each year on feeding trials to make sure that their dogs contain a safe balance of energy, carbs, fat, protien, vitamins, and minerals.  And you get what you pay for.  That means if you pay more for your food it is going to be more digestable and if you buy a cheap brand (such as ol' roy---which is still better than raw) it will be less digestable.  Dogs might come from wolves many many years ago but we have domesitcated them and now they are considered omnivores (eat both plants and animals).  Cats on the other hand are considered carnivores and the protein in their diet is much higher (protein usually comes from meat).  Dog are susceptible to bacterial infections from raw foods such as Salmonella which is another reason to not feed raw.  Anyone who makes a homemade diet (raw diet) needs to consult with their vet and make sure it contains an appropriate balance of protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, and minerals.  This is usually a lot of work and if this delicate balance is disrupted it can cause life long problems for your dog (especially in puppies who are rapidly growing and making their skeleton that will support them for the rest of their life).  I know this is a very controversial subject (and a lot of people out there think feeding raw is appropriate but they are very wrong) so I suggest that you visit your veterinarian when you get your puppy and talk about a diet then.  Ultimatly getting your answer here is not safe or fair for your puppy.  No one on here can prove they are a veterinarian and that is the person who you should be getting your advice from.  Please please consult with a vet and I am sure you will be happy with feeding a regular puppy diet.  and on the bright side it will be much eaiser for you.  Good luck and have fun with your new puppy!
i4LRjdhSaa	I have one and they are very ugly. They have short noses and constantly make snorting noises. If they aren't groomed regularly their hair grows very long and easily becomes dirty and matted. They aren't good with kids usually, but most small dog's aren't. Well ours is ok with kids 5 and up, but I wouldn't recommend one for anyone with a child younger than that. I'm not sure if our dog is unique in this, but he has a licking obsession and causes bald spots on our cat and other dog. Our vet is baffled by this because nothing we have tried stops him. If your asking this because you want a dog I recommend a Golden retriever. They are friendly, easy to train, easy to groom, and great with kids. Shih tzu's can be great too, but they are more likely to be difficult.|`|AxaspNJJaa	They are wonderful! They are friendly(with kids and other animals/dogs), cute, intelligent(but somewhat stubborn), a toy dog, they don't shed, and loyal...as every dog is!

YFTZM86maa	Go to a gas station or other store and ask if you can have an old sign.  They get these free and will just throw them away.  They tend to be made of coroplast, but be sure that they are and score them so that the printed side is outside.  You will get free coroplast and do some recycling.  Gas stations, this time of year, may be advertising things for snowmobiles or ice fishing, even cigarette sales etc.  They should have those available soon enough, or have old ones some where.|`|BYMaGYIvaa	pet co.
d9f6c13f6da37d1684ffdce18339d0e3aa	The most important things right now are keeping her healthy and eating well.  Even if she is already eating regular food, you could probably moisten it for her.  You could also mix in a spoonful or two of plain yogurt; in addition to the dietary benefits, yogurt will also encourage healthy bacteria growth to make sure she's digesting her food properly.  I would feed her at least 4 times a day, following the feeding recommendations on the bag's label.      As for walking, I wouldn't let her outside your house and yard until she's had her first or second set of puppy shots, and even then I wouldn't let her come in contact with other dogs until she's had the bordetella vaccine for kennel cough.  And even once she's able to be outside safely, she probably won't last on a walk for more than 15 minutes until she's over 10 or 12 weeks.  Just keep this in mind when you're planning your outings with her; if she'll be a large dog, you may not want to have to carry her around while you finish your walk!      From 8 to 10 weeks she will go through the "fear" period, where puppies can be unusually frightened and cautious of things they weren't previously bothered by.  During this time, be easy with your discipline and try to help boost her confidence.    Puppies separated from their litter before 7 weeks can often develop socialization problems.  When you play with her, try to remember that you are the dominant one, and she is still learning.  When she bites you, yelp very loudly (like her siblings would) and move away to let her know that biting hurts and will make others not want to play with her.      I am going to recommend a book to you, called "The Art of Raising a Puppy", by the Monks of New Skete.  Though their book is focused on German Shepards primarily, its lessons and techniques can be applied to any breed.  The first few chapters go over the puppy's early development (which I think will be particularly resourceful for you), and the later chapters break up into behavior, basic obedience, and proper care, socialization, and bonding.  You can probably find it at any bookstore, but here is the Barnes & Noble website link so you know what you're looking for:    http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Art-of-...    Good luck!  Raising young puppies is challenging, but if you're prepared with the right resources and information, then you could have a much easier time and a much better dog.|`|AA12340941	I don't blame you for taking her now so that it doesn't wind up in the wrong hands.  It shouldn't need anything much different than if you took it at 8 weeks.  Make sure to get it to vet so it can be wormed tho and of course its first shots.  Other than that lots of LOVING!  :-)|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	You should wait on the walks and give her a lot of love bottle feed her for a couple weeks also to help nurish her|`|s7gWSqV5aa	You may want to bottle feed it for a few weeks...I would highly recommend the Puppies for Dummies book (though its title is insulting).|`|aGdGNGbpaa	some people say too wait till they are 8 weeks but some dont the lady i got my two chihuahua pups from was sellin them atg 6 weeks also and i bought 2 the runt of the litter and the one that was born before the runt and they were fine, i just went and bought two little bottles along with puppy formula just in case but i didnt even need it they drank regular milk and ate soft dog food too and i took them to the vet and they were ok not a single thing wrong with them, so i think ur puppy should be fine.|`|7bnQmXksaa	do not take her for walks or allow her to interact with other dogs untill she is completely vacanted. let her in the yard only and not for too long. DO not take your eyes off her and never let her eat stuff.. Crate train her. make sure she get a lot of sun light. put crate near a window its important and do not let her bite or chew on your hands ever. 6 weeks is not so dramatic. it will be ok.. just take her to the vet the first day you get her and do not taek chances on walks or other dogs untill about 3 months after she has all her shots. this is for sure . I got a 6 week old rotie and he is find and fat and happy a year later.. Good luck,,,,|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	6 weeks is fine for a dog to leave its mum and can get inoculated if its eating drinking by itself as a lot of fostered pups do go at 5 weeks to a new owner if hand reared, as long as they are healthy, they do thrive and get socialised  then I dont foresee a problem. keep it indoors and go to a vet for a once over and inoculation advice the day you get her. check she hasnt got a heart murmer or needs wormed etc. just treat her like a baby small meals lots of warmth , make her feel safe and a radio on and a small bed of her own her own dishes and puppy food and then lots of waggy tails to come and widdles and poos on pee pads they are great things! good luck|`|z0X4EhfRaa	I would be careful about walking anywhere where other dogs go due to the fact that until she has all 3 sets of puppy shots she is not fully protected against diseases like parvo and distemper. Your doing right by bringing her to the vet. for an exam and first shots. Just love her and keep her quarantined to your house and yard at least till fully vac. so you don't run the risk of her catching something.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Run as fast as you can.  Every pup that is obtained from an unreputable backyard greeder means that another dog/pup will be euthanized in a shelter.  You are only supporting such a moronic person as this one.|`|L22hVXTIaa	You can wet or soak her dog food with a little puppy milk formula for a while, but be sure you choose a good quality dog food.  Other than that, treat he as you would any other puppy.  As you said, she is very young and should have stayed with her mom a little longer, so take extra precautions to make sure you keep her warm, etc.  I wouldn't take her on any walks this young, and especially no walks or anywhere else until after she's finished her puppy series vaccinations.  Then it should be fine.  Good luck with her.|`|3g9HQAw2aa	Since 6 weeks is too young, please keep her indoors and away from other animals until she is fully vaccinated. The first set of shots won't fully protect her yet. If you take her out, she will run a high risk of catching parvo or other diseases. Instead of walking her, just have play sessions with her and that will be enough exercise until she is older. If you take her on walks now, it will be too much on her and it could do damage to her rapidly growing bones and joints. I would watch what she is eating and how much. Her teeth are so tiny that she really won't be able to chew a hard kibble. If you choose to go with kibble, then you can put warm water on it and turn it into a type of mush. You will have to make sure she's eating every 3-4 hours since her stomach is small and she's in a fast growing stage now. Make sure you keep in in a crate if you can't be there to watch her. She can get herself hurt if she's able to wander the house. Just keep her warm and happy. It's sad that the lady won't keep them just 2 more weeks. Personally I don't let a pup leave my home until 10 weeks. If a person wants them sooner, too bad. I like to make sure they are healthy, weaned, eating a proper diet, vaccinated, and ready to separate first. Sounds like you are ready to take on this little fur baby and give her all she needs.|`|nYv65TlEaa	its the same as a 8 week old  ,she hasn't got all her shots,so I wouldn't advise walks around your area nor the dog park,just in the back yard or wee pads if puppy is small breed or to cold,puppies should have all their shots before any walking or dog park,so till at the least 16 weeks old,but you could walk puppy in your yard if there isn't any outbreaks of any,your Vet will let you know whats in your area,like rabis,parvo and so on    all you need to do is give love,feed her right now 4 times a day,give dry kibble,even if you have to feed one kibble at a time,make sure she eats about 15 kibble at each feeding,as the weeks go by increase kibble amount,by 3 months,she could be down to eating 3 times a day and of course more kibble    small breed after 3 months old should at the least eat 1/2 a cup of food a day if not more,give water,and potty train now,they are so easy to train    I have 4 week old puppies who use the wee pad no problem    what breed is the puppy?    My first dog was 6 weeks old too,and he did just great    do not give formula,do not wet food,puppy has teeth    Puppies are weened by 6 weeks    ADDED    she is beautiful,oh ya she'll need more food,go by her weight on how much a day she should eat,make sure its a great quality puppy food    Best of Luck with her  you saved a sweet furball  God Bless|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	6 weeks old is perfectly fine. BYBs let many dogs go at this age. If she is alreadying eating regular food, keep her on that. They can eat the dry food at this age, and should be. She doesnt need any extra puppy formula or milk. She was weened from her mother a few weeks ago.     Shots are a must! Your vet will tell you what she needs now and when she needs to come back (3 weeks or so). But until she has all three sets of her booster shots, dont take her out where other dogs are. You can potty train her in your back yard (that sort of thing) but dont let her interact with other dogs or their feces. You dont know if they are vaccinated or not.
nVHXdfiDaa	Take it to a vet. Could be an allergic reaction to something, but as i can  not see it, I am not sure. if it 's not raw skin, bath the dog, see if it goes away with it, then you will know it is a contact allergy. Search what it might caused it. Go to a pet store, there are some special shampoos and lotions to stop itching. But allergies can be food allergies also, flea allergies, etc. If after the bath is not gone, go to a vet.|`|07YBD5mJaa	it might be ringworm. i would look up some pictures of ringworm and compare them to your dog's rash. if they compare, i would run to your local wal mart and pick up some anti fungal cream, athletes foot cream. apply it twice a day and it will clear up. if it doesn't compare, it could be a case of mange, which is something you would have to take to a vet. best wishes!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Might be mange which is contagious.

I would check to see what causes the rash or irritation to occur.  Take him to the vet to be sure though.    Good luck!    Blake|`|AA11179899	I had a bulldog I got as a puppy whom had a bad rash.

OWGBAiXtaa	You will have to ignore the barking and whining.  Don't give in.  I think you are on the right path by deciding to crate train your puppy, but you should have resigned yourself to many sleepless nights before now.  The puppy is 8 weeks you say?  I wouldn't expect an 8 week old puppy to go much more than 3 hours in a crate at night without a potty break, so set up a regular schedule through the night to give your puppy potty breaks.  On the scheduled potty breaks, do not play with your puppy or even really talk to her- just keep the whole process of taking her out to do her business very matter of fact and boring.  Treat it like a chore so the breaks do not become looked forward to by the puppy.  As she ages, you can extend the period of time between breaks.  The rule of thumb for puppies for holding their bladders is one hour per month of age plus 1 hour.  Your puppy is two months old, so that makes three hours.  When she is 4 months old, you can expect 5 hours, etc.|`|2eJcaeOPaa	when she's crying i hope you are ignoring her. have you tried covering the crate with a blanket?|`|6qh6sRX9aa	Put her in her kennel and put the kennel right next to your bed.

LvePBiyXaa	Sunbursts are just a yellow Hippocampus erectus. Since seahorses can change colors, I would recommend getting them from a less expensive source. Seahorsesource.com sells Hippocampus erectus for almost 2/3s less than "Sunbursts" are marketed for. Your best option is mail order, but if you need to get them from a local fish store, be sure they get Captive Bred seahorses not wild caught, or those that are net pen raised (which many LFS's don't know).<br>  <br>  To start a marine aquarium, I would check out wetwebmedia.com and reefcentral.com for the basics. Seahorses have special requirements, I have an article on basic seahorse care here: <a href="http://www.fusedjaw.com/?p=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.fusedjaw.com/?p=9</a><br>  <br>  I would anticipate it taking 4 to 6 months after setting up your aquarium for it to be established enough for seahorses.|`|AA11901352	The answer is still the same as the last time<br>  <br>  Wow you do know these fish go for around $180+ each and a breeding pair go for well over $800 These fish are not easily found.<br>  <br>  Try one of these.

First and I would like to stress this one word, PATIENCE.<br>  <br>  First step for your tank is figuring out where you are going to put it. Remember with a salt water tank, you are going to have to leave room behind the tank for access, filters etc. About 8-12 inches. (This will also help to protect walls from salt evaporation. I'll explain later) Once you have that, we are ready to start.<br>  <br>  Do you have a local fish store to trust? One that relies on good fish keeping and good advice to stay in business. Find one even if you have to drive a few miles out of your way. They can be a large asset when it comes to fish.<br>  <br>  Since you want to raise clown fish you have afew options. You have your tank, but do you have what you need to go into in. <br>  <br>  To start, you do not NEED a protein skimmer if you have good filtration and are willing to care for the tank. They are prefered but, my 30 gallon has never had a skimmer or power heads and still doesn't.<br>  <br>  For a beginner, I would suggest dolomite (Crushed coral) for the bottom of your tank (Easier to care for). If you are not going to be runninga protein skimmer, this will make cleaning SO much easier. You will also want to get a gravel siphon for cleaning (these can range from a couple of bucks to upwards of $50. You don't need anything fancy, just a siphon). A heater is a must $10-15), thermometer $1.95 In the tank only a floater of one that attaches doesn't matter. It should be placed the farthest from your heater as possible.) A hydrometer These can run from a few dollars and up. Just a floating hydrometer is fine. around $4.00. Some packages of salt you will purchase sometimes come with a hydrometer, so this may help. Instant Ocean makes a quality synthetic salt. ($22.00). (When you start moving up in the salt water I would suggest switching to Red Sea Salt.) Power heads are beneficial, but at this point not necessary. They can be added on at any time. Get a quality Dechlorinator. (DO NOT USE start right or stress coat in your marine tank) AquaNova + is a good dechlor and it also adds back trace minerals to the water. you do not need anything else chemical wise for your tank at this time. One 5 gallon bucket. $2.29 each at home depot or walmart.<br>  <br>  Ok I think we are ready to start. Be sure your tank is clean. You can use a salt water mix to clean your tank. There is also an aquarium cleaner you can buy but for your tank, a mix of 1/2 cup of salt dissolved in a gallon of water will do. (no specifics here.) Clean the tank rinse and let's get started.<br>  <br>  If you chose to use the dolomite you do not want to use more than will cover 1 1/2 - 2 inches across the bottom. (Sand will require the same) Use a kitchen sive and clean the gravel by rinsing it. Dump the gravel into the bucket and swish the heck out of it. Drain the cloudy water and rinse again.<br>  <br>  (You will only do this if you are using dry dolomite. LIVE dolomite and live sand do not get rinsed)<br>  <br>  Pour the gravel into the bottom of your tank. Doesn't need to be perfect or flattened yet since you are going to be dumping water into your tank and this is going to dislocate it anyway. Using your 5 gallon bucket, fill just about 4 gallons or 4 1/5 depending on how much you can lift. Add the required amount of Dechlor and then the salt. (Usually 1.5 pounds or 24 oz or 3 cups per 5 gallons, however I have never used that much to obtain a 1.022 gravity in my tank.) I start by adding a cup and a half mixing to disolve (and I use hot tap water here about a gallon then add cold water) I will check the hydrometer to see how far off I am and either add more salt or more fresh water. Since you are setting up your tank, obtaining an exact 1.022 is not that important right now, getting close is. Continue dissolving salt and new water until your tank is about 3-4 inches from the top. Attach your filter (be sure it is rinsed well as well as the filters) if you choose to use a rear filter. Even so a back pack filter also needs rinsed. Now we have water movement. <br>  <br>  I did not mention anything about live rock or any other items for your tank yet. At this stage since you REALLY should not try to cycle your salt water this early with live rock. It will die off (This is what most people think creates a quike cycle, it doesn't) If you only knew what things grow on and in the rock, don't waste your money now. It really isn't needed. Now that your tank is running. Check the water with the hydrom

Grandad would stumble out of the car and set his beer down to see what happened, and on more than one occation he puked (could have been the alcohol more than nerves though) before Stevie couldn't lay still anymore and would burst out laughing.    Gotcha Grandad!|`|XbmZu0zKaa	you expect me to believe that you accidentally stepped on the cat and killed it?i'm sorry but that sounds very far fetched.the only way you would of been able to step on the cat is if it was already badly injured.any cat would of heard you coming and ran out of the way.go see your neighbour and don't be a wimp.|`|FncFYplJaa	I doubt that it was such an "accident".

ymdPniDYaa	Perhaps make it easier for people to pick it up - provide lots of trash containers and a box where everyone can donate their extra plastic bags?      Also, send a notice to everyone that the poop & scoop rule is going to be more aggressively enforced and then hire someone for a couple of weeks to stand around and catch people.      Or, you could hire a professional pooper scooper to come and pick it all up once a week.  It's not responsible pet ownership, but at least you won't have a giant mess all the time.|`|AA10283080	While I was visiting Seneca Lake one year I noticed that along the walkway between my hotel and the lake there were trash cans every so many feet.

Or give the responsibility to someone else, for when he is not around.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	I have had the same issue at my condo with people not picking up after their animals. I solved the issue by giving every dog owner in the complex a large keychain size doggie doo bag dispenser filled with scented dog poo bags. It was a little expensive, but definately worked. You can also discuss possibly setting up a "dog walk area" in your apartment complex where they can supply a dispenser of doggie bags and a trash can for the owners to dispose of the poo there.  Also, I would recommend speaking directly to the owners yourself. I have seen many people get removed from apartment complexes because they have medical problems where they cannot bend down to pick up the dog's poo, and the managers do not see this as any sort of excuse. You never know who could have a medical condition, so it may be useful to speak to the residents that you can (if you are in a small community) about their doggie doo problems.  In my condo community, I have set up a "dog owner's club" for the complex. This is a great chance for the dogs to socialize, as well as the owners. In these meetings we discuss any problems we have been having. With me being a professional dog trainer, I offer free advice and discounted training to residents of my community.  Hope I have given you some good ideas or some ways to help this problem!|`|FxAD44Moaa	eh,   so that's what the manager says?   i don't think the manager has done anything because....      that waste from animals is also a health code violation..    there is a city ordinance and state law against leaving waste materials of any kind from any living creature.    these people can be fined, lose their pets and may serve some time if they don't soon attend to their inability to care for an animal properly and to dispose of hazardous materials accordingly.    the manager is pulling your chain.. if they were really doing anything there would not be an issue.    the manager is suppose to post notices about this and site the law pertaining to this problem..    i guess they've not done  that either?    time to call the city,  city hall even and  ask about this and tell them you have talked endlessly with management and apparently nothing's been done to resolve this issue and health code violation.    i assure you then the management may actually sit upright and try to do something.    that's a problem and there are laws!    they must clean up after their pet..   if this persists..   videoize  this and contact someone at city hall in the appropriate department.. (someone should be able to send you to the proper department let alone some authority)    and again discuss this manner, the problem you're having and how management and the owners haven't done their part in notifying the tenants of this... LAW!    it's the LAW.    in all states there is a law about this.    make note of that.      your manager is just pushing you away,  appeasing you so you don't bother them with this often.    time to break out the ol' video camera..   make videos, take pictures,  make sure you get good close ups and shots including the surrounding area so it's recognizable where this is happening and keep all of that.    someone should have had their heads rolling about this already.    the management is authorized and obligated to post notices about this and state  certain articles of this in a memo or notice that can be posted in each building or sent to each tenant...  and  also stating that it's the LAW!    where i  live one is socked with a $300 fine and if they don't pay or behave they can serve time in jail and lose their pet.     we  had a serious problem with this until the management finally posted a notice and it sure took care of the major problem..   sure we still get poopies.. but the tenant is soon alerted  of the law and they do obide very shortly afterward.    we have a notice up all of the time about people having to follow the law of cleaning up after their pets.      time for your clueless manager to check up on the local city ordinances pertaining to this.. you also so you will be up to speed and  know your rights when it comes to this.    and NO do not clean up after these people..    talk with animal control also,  they will have information.    also online i'm sure your city has a site with all the details and laws that are to  be known by those who dwell within the city..     i know there's laws about this,  all states have this.    either your manager is a lazy fool,  taking advantage of your 'lack of knowledge'   or is so careless that they don't realize they're a liability because they're not attending to this situation!   it's their duty,  they are the manager they are suppose to know the city and state laws.. that's part of their job in this business and they are liable!   (along with the pet owners.)       i'm sure the manager does know they just don't care. but they can  be sued and fined  for violations.
KxjUim7yaa	Dogs are not really good to get with a small child. Toddlers are very hard on a pet.All the hypoallergenic dogs are small and fluffy. The best match might be a standard poodle.|`|ODZeyNYMaa	I am always a fan of shelter dogs! You would probably want a smaller dog for apartment dwelling. Any shelter has experienced people there to help you choose the one that is right for you, and mutts usually don't having the over-breeding problems that purebreds have.   They will also know what kinds are less likely to cause allergy attacks!  Good Luck, I hope you find a fella that fits with your family!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well you don't mention the age of your child, so I will not recommend a dog, other than a stuffed one.  Dogs are stressed by small children, and small children do not know how to treat dogs.  There is no hypoallergenic dog, all dogs have dander, so you need to know how to give a dog a bath.  A puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 3 hours at the most, so keep that in mind.  You also need to be good at training, when people buy a dog, it is often said that the dog is already potty trained, or trained period, and it is not until after you get the dog home that you find out the dog has issues, so make sure you get it from a good source.|`|PM23RDycaa	A standard poodle IF it fits your lifestyle, otherwise wait til your kid is older.

kRO55DHyaa	Has the dog seen a vet, and has the vet taken a swab of the ear to be certain there is no infection?  It's not normal for a dog to have stinky ears without an infection present (yeast or bacteria, or even both).  I would discuss this further with the vet-I have never seen a dog with stinky ears that did NOT have infection of some sort going on.|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA,  how do you know for sure he has not go a infection.  my dog had really smelly ears,there was no sign of fluid in the ear to cause a infection.after 3 days i took him to the vet,and he had middle ear infection.so go and get your dog check out, he must be in pain.|`|KxjUim7yaa	There has to be something. They need to be clean and dry.|`|H2eaqPE0aa	THEY PROBABLY aren't as clean as you think. There is most likely wax down where you can't see it? OR the hair in the ears needs to be pulled/clipped.

The average cost is about 250.- our rescue has had several dogs treated for parvo and they are all just fine now - the key is to to get the dog to the vet and get him hydrated through the worst of it , no way would any vet charge 7000.-|`|JBPsePnwaa	Yes|`|Spycl8Ikaa	hmm im not sure. my dog had parvo once and we had to pay 7000 to get him fixed. it was sad and he almost didnt make it. we love him and hes the sweetest dog in the world.|`|jPCRqtfLaa	Hey, Rescue Member: YES, there ARE vets out there who would charge INSANE amounts to cure the animal of parvo. There are certain things that effect the price to save dear Fido's life, keep in mind, the LOCATION of the veterinary facility, and the LENGTH OF STAY, resources, medication, etc that it takes to get him/her through it. I, for one, had to pay almost 4 THOUSAND DOLLARS to save my amstaff from the Parvovirus that she was vaccinated against in a shelter when I adopted her. I had her for barely 2 days as a happy, active, and normal puppy untill she became deathly ill and the shelter wouldnt help me at all... I was forced to turn to the vet who said that since it is parvo, she might not survive at all and warned me that it WAS a very expensive risk to take if I wanted to go ahead and hospitalize her. Living in upscale Irvine in Southern California, that WAS the price of saving my dog's life from Parvo. After this experience, I went to school and became a registered Veterinary Technician (again, in California). It is horrendous, but true, that the cost of imperitive and emergency veterinary care is sky high, and I believe that this is why there is pet insurance out there (which I now have for all of my dogs, and it has since paid off again and again). To finally answer the Questioner, yes, it turns out that if the dog was young enough and still developing when he/she got the virus, and you waited long enough before catching the sickness and going for help to break her fever, then he/she quite possibly might have gotten some kind of developmental problem from it. If your dog is a male, you might also want to check with your vet and make sure that both of his testicles have dropped. If only one has decended, then the strange behavior could be due to hormonal problems, and you'll want to have him castrated.

P8hOtEdOaa	Houston has a ban on wild animals.  I do not know if groundhogs would fall under it.  I would suggest contacting animal control and asking them.  Here is a small portion of the law.     ARTICLE III. KEEPING OF WILD ANIMALS*     Sec. 6-51. Wild animal defined.   As used in this article, the term wild animal shall mean any mammal, amphibian, reptile or fowl of a species that is wild by nature and that, because of its size, vicious nature or other characteristics, is dangerous to human beings. Such animals shall include, but not be limited to, lions, tigers, leopards, panthers, bears, wolves, wolf-dog hybrids, cougars, coyotes, coyote-dog hybrids, raccoons, skunks (whether deodorized or not), apes, gorillas, monkeys of a species whose average adult weight is 20 pounds or more, foxes, elephants, rhinoceroses, alligators, crocodiles, caymans, fowl larger than a macaw, all forms of venomous reptiles and any snake that will grow to a length greater than eight feet. The term shall also include any animal listed as an "endangered species" under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, or any fowl protected by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The term wild animal shall not include gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice and domesticated rabbits.   (Ord. No. 99-404,  1, 4-28-99)     Sec. 6-52. Possession prohibited.   (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to be in possession of a wild animal within the city.     (b) It shall be unlawful for the owner or other person in possession or control of any lot, tract or parcel of land within the city or any residence or business premises situated thereon to knowingly suffer or permit any other person to be in possession of a wild animal upon the property, residence or premises.     (c) As used in this section, the term to be in possession includes any harboring or keeping of a wild animal, whether on a temporary or permanent basis and includes, without limitation, holding or keeping the wild animal for the temporary and/or limited purpose of sale or transfer or offering of sale or transfer to another person.     (d) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that the wild animal is being possessed in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws and that:      (1) The wild animal is being kept for treatment in an animal hospital operated by a veterinarian licensed in Texas;      (2) The wild animal is being kept at a public zoo that is accredited by a nationally recognized zoological association;      (3) The wild animal is being kept at a shelter operated by a state or federally recognized humane agency for the purpose of its transfer to a refuge or sanctuary;      (4) The wild animal is being kept for medical research or teaching purposes at a medical school or licensed hospital or by a university or college offering an accredited degree program;      (5) The wild animal is in the possession of an airline, motor freight agency, rail freight agency or other carrier, and its possession in the city is incidental to transportation, provided that the wild animal is secured within a cage or other enclosure that is adequate to prevent its escape; or      (6) The wild animal is being kept or transported temporarily for a production in accordance with a permit or registration under section 6-55 of this Code.

NnYB9eXiaa	NO! The mother eats the pups (yes, they're called pups) not the father.    Go to the library, get some books out on hamsters.  Talk to a local breeder, see if they'll mentor you.      The following list may look like all negative things, and the first section IS a list of reasons not to breed unless you are completely prepared, the second section contains information you need to know if you still decide to breed.    Please keep all the following things in mind BEFORE you breed:    Don't breed if your hamsters are from a pet store.    Why?    Poor breeding causes things like shortened lifespans, susceptibility to illness, and poor temperement (i.e. aggressive hamsters).    Well bred hamsters are not aggressive; this does not mean they won't ever bite, but it does mean they won't go out of their way to bite and will be generally more receptive to handling and be quite a bit friendlier.    Second, if they are from a pet store you don't know their genetic background.    You may be passing along undesirable traits such as aggressiveness and tendencies towards cancers, illness, and physical deformities.    Third, hamsters can have 14+ babies per litter.    Selling them to a pet store guarantees their death; they will be sold as feeders for reptiles and snakes.    Unless you can line up 14+ homes ahead of time, DO NOT BREED.    Fourth: Hamsters are already seriously overpopulated in pet stores; many go for feeders, many more die before they leave the store.    Unless you have an exceptionally rare mutation, and know its (and its prospective mate's) genetic background and pedigree, you should not breed them.    There is no good reason to breed already poorly, and over bred hamsters.    Please do not breed your hamsters for their sake and the sake of any offspring.    If you want more hamsters, adopt one from a shelter, buy one from a breeder, or as a dead last resort, buy one from a pet store. [Edit from Daisy - try petfinder, freecycle and craigslist as well]    Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal, not just because they were able to buy a male and female.    http://www.pet-care-experts.com/archive....    ----------------------------------    Important information before making a big decision:    1. You'll need quite a few cages, bins are preferable as breeding cages but there is money involved in setting up a hamstery.    2. You generally need a room just for the hamstery, you aren't going to want a lot of disturbance with the pups or pregnant mothers - especially if you have other animals or small children in the house.    3. You'll be spending a lot of time with your hamsters, you need to make sure that you have time with school and other activities to balance this out.    4. You need to be prepared for visits to the vet.  These aren't always inexpensive visits.    5. You'll need lots of research on genetics and health history.  Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal.  You should never breed a hamster bought from a pet store, so you'll need to find a local breeder - perhaps they'll mentor you - again, this will take a lot of your free time.    6.  You need to make sure you have homes lined up *before* you begin breeding.  It's safe to assume a minimum of 2-4 pups and it can be upwards of 14 in a litter.      7.  You really shouldn't try to sell the pups until you've bred multiple times and built up a reputation.  This means you won't be earning money from the pups, so there will be money involved that you won't be able to recoup for awhile.    Just remember, study, research, think, then breed! Try to possibly find an breeder online that will mentor you. Home breeding, when done responsibly is perfectly fine - just be sure you're ready and you start with 2 healthy animals whom you know the genetics and health history of :)|`|ktVkRc3Raa	Yes the male will eat the young so when you know that the female hamster is pregnant take the male hamster out right away.

BIG plate like hooves dont!|`|IznF8H1jaa	In the old days, they were hitched to plows, and worked on a days end, for their whole life, and never had a problem. They're bigger to get more traction, and to have much more power beneath their feet. In my family, horses were used for farm labor also, and they all lived wonderful lives.|`|8i4L5rGEaa	They are over-sized horses!  They would look funny with itty bitty feet, not to mention that it would be bad for all of that body weight.  Show Clydesdales also wear Scotch bottom shoes which can make their feet look really big too.    Scotch bottom shoe info is here-    http://www.troikadrafts.com/savvy.html
8PPWZxDNaa	well we got a daschund from our neighbors for free and im 15 and my dog is in love with me i might as well be the owner other than the fiance aspect of it so if you can find one daschund are fun loving dogs. mine loves all the dogs around the neighborhood as a matter of fact i have never seen him bark at another dog.just train them early they are kind of stubborn and watch there backs other than that very easy to take care of. :]|`|PM23RDycaa	Small breeds are typically high maintenance. And unless its being adopted a toy breed pet quality pup from a reputable breeder can easily start out at 900 depending on the breed.    A very very small ie bred down runt is VERY high maintenance and not a good idea with bigger dogs as they are more likely to be injured accidentally OR be badly bred and thus full of health issues.    Is a fourth dog really needed?|`|dRUgXlOLaa	A maltese is perfect.  They are adorable and cute.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	A stuffed dog from your local toy store.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	i dont think your going to get a cheap small to be honest but there a chance in looking|`|tKBWZ7mCaa	Your best bet is to go to the local shelter and pick a small mixed breed.  The shelter staff can tell you if it gets along with other dogs, and as long as you pick one with a short coat you won't have to worry about lots of maintenance (other than normal nail clipping, bathing, and brushing).    Don't get a dog just for yourself unless your parents agree to care for the dog when you graduate high school and leave the house.  In a couple of years you will want to go to college, and dorms don't allow animals.  When I went to college, my dog stayed home with my parents.  He's now 12 and he still lives with them, because that is what he knows and they love having him.  So make sure your parents want to take care of another dog before you get one!|`|hTT8DhYfaa	... maltese mix... that way its cheap. :) they are sooo cute|`|x0Z19HJGaa	Get a mutt from the humane society for 75 bucks or go to a street corner and look for free small puppies. You don't have to buy a pure bred dog. My little Dale is 9 lbs and the best dog I have ever had. He was free in the parking lot at Walmart.
5dDNqwlzaa	Buy a large cage for your dog when you leave the house.  Put lots of her toys and other things she enjoys (bones, etc.) in there also.  That way she's refined to only the cage.  Hopefully she'll learn to sleep on top of the things she has in there with her.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	If you figure it out let me know.  My chihuahua is always taking things and hiding it in his bed.  He is a little theif.....but a cute one!!!!
XK9RLaPeaa	Landlords never find out about small animals, especially a hamster. I have sneaked a cat, a bearded dragon, and a guinea pig into many places with no problem. You only have to worry if you let it out and it tears something up, which a hamster really couldn't. If you dont want to sneak the hamster in, then try putting him in the newspaper or craigslist.com free to good home. And have the potential adopters come over so you can check them out first, so you know it is getting a good home. There also might be a rodent rescue in your area, just do a search online. Good Luck! Sorry.|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	It's a hamster, I doubt they would even know but if you're really against bringing the hamster I would see if a family member or close friend would take it.  It would be really devastating to your daughter and the hamster though so I would just keep it.  If the landlord comes over hide it or say that you're just hamster sitting for someone.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	Hide it.  It's not like the landlord can walk into your house without warning anyhow.  Just don't tell them, what is it really going to hurt anyhow?|`|Q87djE0laa	im not supposed to have pets in my house but the land lord doesnt even know. they only live for about 3 yr anyway, its not like its a dog|`|IznF8H1jaa	Explain to your daughter what's going on, and get her a couple fish after. Offer the pet to the shelter, they'll take it in. Or sneak it in.|`|tXT63mFtaa	Give her to a relative - this way you could see your hammy any time and you won't have to worry about care , it would be like having her petsitted , Only forever.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Pine and cedar bedding should never be used for hamsters or other small mammals.  It gives off oil fumes that hurt their lungs and can cause respiratory illness and sometimes death.    I recommend Carefresh Ultra, it's hypoallergenic, low in dust content, and does a much better job with odor absorption than wood shavings do.    If you'd prefer to stay with a wood bedding, you'll need to switch to Aspen.    Please make the change as soon as you can, before the sneezing turns into something worse!    Good luck!|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	no he is allergic to the bedding|`|ttWY0vJeaa	I would try changing the bedding to Carefresh bedding. Your hammy could be sneezing due to the pine bedding.|`|752a09253c730785a794709c07fc1192aa	Change you bedding to Carefesh litter as the poor ham is most likely allergic to the pine.    Best of Luck!|`|BYMaGYIvaa	he is probably allergic to something on the bbed or in the cage|`|C4V11yJLaa	Umm somebody did'int do there home work before getting a hamster..!    YOU NEED TO SWITCH BEDDINGS!!! Pine is NOT safe bedding and will cause lots of problems to the hamster including respiratory problems.    In other words just change the pine to Care Fresh.|`|alaUYtRcaa	well he is probably allergic to the bedding try getting normal white bedding  oh and that is NOT normal|`|p5APgWW0aa	Aw, poor hamster! my gerbils sometimes sneeze but not like that! I don't think there's anything wrong with him, but maybe I'd take him to a vet just in case - you sound like someone who cares about their pets! A vet's opinion is the best one, because anyone on here can tell you anything.    Sorry it's not great advice, but it's all I can offer up for now! Tell your hammy that I wish he feels better!|`|yDkm4ULsaa	pine bedding is very bad (as well as other wood beddings) it causes respiratory problems and is very bad for them. go buy some carefresh, thats what i use for my rats and mouse.|`|VVrMSqGFaa	Maybe it is allergic to pine shaving bedding.|`|YZYhgvA7aa	Change to some different bedding this isnt normal it may be dusty bedding as i found out once so i changed it|`|e4aR7naDaa	My hamster does the same thing that yours does! I have two. A panda hamster and a short haired hamster. My panda hamster sneezes like crazy, all of the time and my short haired hamster doesn't at all. They both have the same bedding too so I don't think I have it has to do with the bedding.  I'm just as curious as you are. When I first got my panda hamster and he was sneezing a lot and I called Petco because I was worried. They didn't give me a straight answer but they said that it is completly normal for a hamster to sneeze like that and eventually it'll go away.
Fuewiwbcaa	first thing are they proven pair? have they laid eggs before? second if they are both in the box which is unlikely, they must be cold.  usually they go in to stay warm.  but mostly it's the females that stay in the box.  as for laying eggs you will see when the female will seem a little chubby to you.  and her bottom will be popping out a little bit.  go to the site, that might help:    http://www.wineintro.com/forum/ubbthread...
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	No. Glofish if you mean the genetically modified very brightly coloured fish, are Zebra Danios, a cyprinid (Tetras are characins).     Ich is primarily caused by stress and bad water quality allowing the parasite to multiple. A healthy tank shouldn't have ich outbreaks, if you're having repeated outbreaks address your tank set up.    Read this on how to treat ich:  http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Ich|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes they are and your ich problem that sucks if you use any medicine make sure it is of non scale fish (smooth skin fish) or you way kill them. And turn off any thing that has carbon in it (like your filter)  when my fish got ich I use table salt to rise the ph level in my tank just add a few tablespoons full yeah I know you shouldn't do that but it's works very well.    17 years experience with fish.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Glo-fish are zebra danio's. My guess is that you have water quality issues with your tank. This will cause stress and illness in your tank. Take a sample of the water to your aquarium shop and have it tested for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. Also, before treating, do a 35% water change with a gravel vac. Treat the water and remove any activated charcoal from the filter during treatment. After treatment, do another 35% water change.    To prevent ich, be sure your tank is large enough for your fish. You don't mention what fish you have and what size tank you have. Assuming that you are not overstocked, you should be changing 15% of the water weekly with a gravel vac. Never change the filter media at the same time as the water change. Too much good bacteria being taken out at once that way.     Also, be sure you are not overfeeding. Feed no more than the fish will eat within 2-3 minutes. Overfeeding will also cause poor water quality issues.    Hope this helps=|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	yes|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	No, they are not in the tetra family (tetras are characins, by the way), they are in the cyprinid family, often called the carp or minnow family. GloFish are a variety of zebra danios, Danio rerio (also called Brachydanio rerio). They are in the same family as other danios, barbs, rasboras, loaches, goldfish, koi, carp, freshwater "sharks," and numerous other species. The Cyprinidae are the largest freshwater fish family.    My favorite ich treatment is one that contains malachite green and formalin (formaldehyde). There are several brands with these active ingredients.    Once you get your tank free of ich, be sure to quarantine any new fish, plants, snails, or other organisms for at least three weeks before adding them to your tank, so you don't re-introduce ich or other pathogens.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	Glo-Fish are dyed Zebra Danios. Raising the temperature in your tank speeds up the life cycle of the parasite, reducing the time an outbreak lasts. If you do this make sure your water is properly oxygenated because raising the temp decreases water's oxygen carrying capacity.|`|wsbp0nuzaa	every fish takes 2 a day ok.
M9o5WpOqaa	From experience:this sounds like a possible broken limb,or a bad sprain,though the snapping sound makes me think it's broken...Please do not wait to have this checked out by a reputable exotics vet!  My daughter had a 6 week old male that suffered a broke back left leg,due to a wheel injury that shattered his tibia (shin bone) in 2.I wasn't sure it was broken at first,until we rushed him to the vet,she cleaned the area of blood,then I saw it-YIKES! Though he was squealing at first,he soon calmed down enough to be administered Metacam for pain.I suddenly found myself having to make a very difficult decision-surgery or euthanasia.  The doctor was able to successfully amputate below his left knee and he is now one happy 3 1/2 legger.Not to scare you,but the cost is outrageous,so it's a decision you will have to make very carefully...I spent $4.99 for Vinnie,and all his care cost almost $500.00,though I don't regret saving his life for a minute!|`|eSoU2C3Waa	i don't know but take her to a vet right away!!|`|Ra6RZyDfaa	Im not sure but take her to the vet right away!|`|GuOJIftAaa	It sounds like you broke her leg. You should really get her to a rat knowledgeable vet. They cant do much in the way of casts or anything like that since they are too small, but the will give you pain medications. Just because she doesn't show any pain when you touch it, doesn't mean its not broken. Rats hide their pain very well.|`|BYMaGYIvaa	not sure|`|YZYhgvA7aa	I dont know please take a visit to the vet.|`|ZdjMX1geaa	My gerbil had the same thing. i took her to the vet and the vet said she was fine if i was to leave it but u can give it surgery. take it to a vet ASAP.
84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	Well I don't know how good or bad you were with your previous dog. If you were irresponsible than maybe that's why she won't let you get one. If you were responsible and actually took care of the dog then use that to your advantage. Remind your mom how well you took care of your other dog and that you will do the same with the new dog. Prove to her that you are able to care for a new dog.<br>  Good luck! :o)|`|SpcYCBndaa	get a dog and tell her that you found your old dog|`|PM23RDycaa	If your mother was attached to your dog as well did you ever think that she is not ready for a new dog even though you are? She also may not want the responsibility of another dog period. She has told you no so honestly just stop bugging her about it. Your mother has her reasons for not wanting a dog and you need to respect that.|`|Pefb1Amfaa	maybe shes just trying to protect you, she must have seen how hurt and upset you where when you lst your previous dog, shes trying to protect you.. just keep trying, maybe try and talk about your old dog and remind her how much she loved having another dog around, she should eventualy give in, of course no dog could replace the old one.|`|0hHw5IK7aa	My mum used to keep dogs and said she wasnt having another - a day at a rescue centre gala soon changed that! Our local rescue centre does an annual open day and we went. It took her no time at all to feel sorry for the poor dogs needing a good home...she adopted her jack russell Henry soon after|`|1Du4Rudvaa	How did you lose your dog?  Maybe your mom still misses the old dog and doesn't want to just replace him.  There really isn't anything you can do to change her mind about wanting another dog.|`|9203e742d7f8e1326e119aa1ca8803e2aa	I can understand that you want a new dog, I've been there myself, but I'm sure your mum has her reasons for not wanting one. You need to find out what those reasons are. If its because she misses your old dog and isn't ready for a new one then you need to let it rest because if you did get one you wouldn't do your mum or your new dog any favours.<br>  <br>  If it's because she doesn't want the responsibility of another dog then it's a different matter. I don't know how old you are or just how much of the responsibility you'd be able to take for the dog. If you're at school or working full time then either your mum is going to have to look after the dog all day or it's going to be left alone. If you don't work then it's going to be your mum who's paying for everything for it. If it's just because of the responsibility then you need to prove to her that you can handle it and you'll do your fair share and just tidying your room and helping around the house for a week or a month isn't going to be enough, it'll take time before your mum will see that you can do what you're promising you will and when you get the dog you need to carry on that way. And most importantly don't make deals like 'if i do... for a month/2 months/ 6 months etc. can I have a dog' because then its going to seem like that's the only reason youre doing it. You need to prove you're capable and responsible before bringing the subject up again.|`|mkA615Ataa	no offence but if you're living in your mums house it's her choice, looking after a dog is hard work not just the fun walks and playing games with them, there's all the vets bills and visits, the constant cleaning up after them, training, cost of dog food and pet insurance. If you're still quite young then you are likely to take off and do your own thing and she'll be left with another dog for another 10 years or so. why cant you wait until you are settled in your own place?|`|40EotGSlaa	1 Cleaning your room and making sure that it STAYS clean and tidy. - done<br>  #2 Making sure that your homework is done and handed in on time.<br>  #3 Sweep the floors in the living room and kitchen without your parents asking you to.<br>  #4 Wash and/or dry the dishes.<br>  #5 Do not fight and argue with your sisters & brothers.<br>  #6 Eat what you are given and don't whine or make "yuck" faces when given it. <br>  #7 Don't talk rudly to adults<br>  #8 Always share with other kids.<br>  #9 Go to bed when you are told to.<br>  #10 Research the pet and breed you want to be 100% certain that it is the right one for you.<br>  # 11 Ask them about getting this new pet in a nice way and don't beg and whine about it.|`|CNhmtKDaaa	Try doing more chores around the house.

6T21TZIQaa	it does sound like the puppy was poisoned or at least got into poison. take all your animals to the vet to be checked out. we had a dog that was poisoned and the vet saved him but we also had one that got poisoned and he died. the quicker you get them to the vet the better chance of being saved. the pets kidneys shut down when poisoned so if they stop peeing it is a good sign of poisoning. also, check out your yard and the surrounding area, i don't know how old your children are, but they could also get into whatever this was.  and do make a police report just in case you need it.  good luck|`|CQww1c2daa	I would call the Police and tell them what happened.|`|0UUDFxR0aa	sounds like anti-freeze poisoning|`|R3glUmwHaa	consult a vet and maybe the police if you think somebody is doing it deliberately|`|8i4L5rGEaa	A necropsy from the vet would be the only definitive way to find out.  Could they have gotten into something?  If they were kept outside when they were found I would suspect that someone had poisoned them.  Do you have any enemies in the neighborhood who would do this?   The puppy sounds like he was poisoned.  I would suggest keeping your pets indoors if you have any questions.  If you get the necropsy done and you have proof that your pets were poisoned, then you have evidence to get the police involved.  I would write down the incidents and exactly what happened so that you can keep a record of this.  Someone who would do this (to a kid's pet especially) is really sick and should have jail time and a big fine at the very least.  I hope this doesn't happen again.|`|P8hOtEdOaa	It sounds like antifreeze poisoning.  Do you know of anyone that had a problem with the animals?  Did you ask your neighbors if the saw anything or had any problems?    I would take all the animals to the vet for a checkup and have them tested for any poisons since you stated they all had been sick.    Report the incident to the police and animal control immediately.|`|J5qSnHxHaa	well next time that happens to your puppy or cat take them to the vet, it might have saved their life. if you dont act fast as you've seen they will die. sounds like they are being poisoned for sure..you need to act fast and take care of the animals and find out who is doing this.
nOlwYnunaa	Love birds are pretty common, you should be able to find one if you look around and be patient.    I keep love birds, parakeets and cockatiels together in an outdoor aviary and havent' had any issues.  Your bird has been alone for quite some time though.  If I were you I would opt for another love bird.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	It's best not to mix lovebirds with other species of pet birds.  Lovebirds can be nippy and aggressive and injure or kill the other bird.  If you get a bigger pet bird like a parrot, the lovebird could be the one getting injured or killed.  Only put another lovebird with it and then keep watch on both of them to make sure they get along.  Make sure you purchase your lovebird from a petstore that gives a written health guarantee.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	It's not advisable to mix species.  It's also not a good idea to put a new bird in with a bird that's been in an established territory for so long.  There will almost definitely be fighting.  If you insist on another bird, get a second cage and be careful letting them out together at first.
FcR8G8hPaa	There are several possible reasons why your horse may be fast at the canter...    - You may not be telling him to not go fast, you may not be consistently telling him not to go fast, or you may not be telling him not to go fast in a way he understands.    - You may be actually telling him to go fast, either by being tense and squeezing with your legs, leaning forward or being too active with your seat.     - He may be worried or confused about rein handling (usually too tight, often with both reins too tight at the same time) or your canter depart aids.    - He may be worried about something in the environment - noises, objects, people, horses.    It's important to know this, because you're going to do some training, and the most trainable horse is calm, listening, getting clear cues and aids, and focused on you not the environment. So check out all of the above before starting what follows.    The objective of speed control is to ensure that the horse quickly arrives at and stays at that speed by himself with no additional input from you. This only works at the canter if all of the foundations at walk and trot are solid. So we start there.    First at the walk. Not the walk under saddle, but the walk from stall to arena or pen to stall or pen to arena.    During this walk, the horse needs to walk at your shoulder at all times, neither faster or slower, and he needs to stop right when you do. You'll correct him when he fails to do this, by yanking on the lead rope (or rein) hard enough to be slightly uncomfortable for him. After three to five repetitions of this, the typical horse paces and stops correctly. When he does, rub his withers and say "good horse" - and if you are walking and he's pacing you, be careful not to stop him when praising him, because if you do, he thinks it's for the stop not the pacing.    This gets him in the mindframe to obey, pace and stop. You need this for him to do well under saddle. You should always keep this as part of your walk in, to keep him sharp. It's going to need lots of reinforcing for weeks before it's normal for him (unless he has this somewhere in his training already or is unusually trainable).    Next, walk under saddle. Ask the horse to stop by opening legs and saying "whoa". If he stops, great. If not, use a half halt with a little "bite" to it - make sure you have some slack in the reins and make sure to tug sharply. If he is still not stopped, "saw" at each rein alternately with enough pressure for him to halt. Then take him back to the walk and repeat immediately.    The objective is a stop within one stride of asking. When he does this, give him a "good horse" and, of course, don't correct him.    Once he's good with this, you then need to apply it to speed control. If he's too fast, every time you feel him speed up you have a second or less to make him "whoa". Then put him back in the walk. It doesn't take a lot for him to get it. You're saying "Be prepared to stop whenever you rush."    With this foundation complete, you need to make it a normal part of your warm up to keep him sharp.    The same activity needs to be done at the trot. When he speeds up, make him stop. And then once the trot / stop is good, work on trot / walk with the same idea (it's a little easier when he gets better at this).     Canter is the same thing, with the transition to the trot being the correction for speeding up.    Remember, you have less than a second to notice him starting to rush.    Once this is solid, make this whole set of manuevers part of your warm up and riding. You'll need to consistently correct his errors whenever you're with him, so stay focused.    Best wishes to you and your horse!|`|iynxbd9Daa	while still in trot sit deep in your saddle and stretch your heels down. give the canter aid only once and don't 'nag' at your horse.  but its also natural for some horses to be forward moving and have more energetic paces|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Pump the reins (softly!) back and forth with each stride. Move them with his mouth. Remember to keep your hands soft. Use your arm muscles, not your hands!|`|RZPLec5Eaa	What I would do is work in small circles and sit way back when you canter him. Do you know what a half-halt is? Like a lot of people have mentioned...it's a good thing to do. I have to do this with my trainers horse. You can also do a lot of check & releases.|`|sUN7TVtzaa	wow you lucky, you get to ride 6 days a week!     ok sit back don't let him canter before you tell him to. try trotting and then cantering in circles and figure eights remember to sit back!  you could try lunging him to get him settled down before riding him. it is maybe just excitment. try making sure he is outside more if he stays in a barn. try giving him a banana i read that it helps controll them and make them want to please you i don't know i haven't tried it but it is worth a shot. try relaxing and just enjoy the ride. if he ets out of hand te turn him in a tight circle and that should stop him. good luck!|`|FncFYplJaa	Push your shoulders back really far  and half halt to slow him down.  While in the process of going into a trot or walk, turn him into a smaller circle.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Try a small check release on the reins. If that dosen't work trysitting the canter.|`|boipPoVJaa	Lean back and half halt him but enough so he does not go back into a trot. If he does not slow down gather more rein and half halt more usually works.|`|WKO9hPUbaa	try half halting and working on a circle|`|RoPLmd2daa	Do you sit the canter or do you go around in half-seat?  For some horses, the forward shift in weight tells them to go faster.  Keep your butt glued to the seat and push down with your butt and lower back to rock him back more. To get him to slow down, you may want to think about cantering over poles- if he goes to fast, he'll trip, so he has to think about where his feet go. Also, try doing gymnastics- a series of jumps (mostly cavalettis) at differing heights at different distances apart. If he rushes, he won't have enough time to set up for the next cavaletti. For the first one, have it at the medium level, the second one the highest one stride away, and the third one at the lowest level and one stride away. You can add more- for the fourth, I would do the highest one stride away and the fifth medium height two strides away, the sixth the lowest and one stride away. To make if more challenging, use small fences and crossrails- lowest at 1 foot (highest cavaletti), medium at 18 inches (crossrail), and highest at 2 feet (small fence).  Those were all one stride apart, but you can vary the distances- have the shortest distance after the highest, and the largest after the lowest. You can do whatever with the mediums.|`|8rVodF9vaa	To get your canter slow, try working on a circle and doing tons of downward transitions.  Start out by doing lots of downward transition work from the trot - for example - do trot/walk/trot/halt/walk/trot/walk... you get the idea. I like to set up my transitions by using a slight half halt before asking for the transition, so the horse is paying attention and knows something new is going to happen. If you do a lot of transition at the trot, your horse should be listening pretty well when you get to cantering.  I like to get on a circle and do something like 5 strides canter, ten steps trot, 5 strides canter, ten steps trot, over and over until the horse figures out that we're not going anywhere in a hurry.     Also, when you are cantering, sit up tall, and deep in the saddle. Do not hang on your reins, try to give and take.|`|IUwfdjQCaa	half halts  gentle squeezes of the inner thigh

She also needs a water bottle. Anything available at the pet store for hamsters will be appropriate for the mouse.  Mice poop A LOT, are you willing to keep up with changing the material in the cage frequently to keep it from stinking?  Pet shops make more money selling supplies than selling animals.  Do you have money or are you parents willing to spend money on this little critter?  If the flat box the mouse is in right now is cardboard, she'll tear that up and get free very quickly.    However - a wild mouse may not become friendly and may bite every time you go to pick it up or try to play with it.  Also wild mice may carry disease or parasites.  Also, are you sure it's a mouse not a baby rat??|`|SjYvZsrOaa	make sure it's not diseased. So, maybe take it to a vet.     http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/careofmic...

Remember to keep plenty of  water. If you can, get a small  cage. But if you have one of  those rubber storage bins,   that'll do to. Just remember  air holes! And throw in some  cardboard tubes for the mouse's  entertainment.|`|Fl22m7O1aa	I think that's really sweet of you to really care so much about this little mouse but you have to be careful of the diseases it could transfer to you if it is wild(I know I'm going take a lot of heat for saying that). Just think of it like this if it you found it in your house it had to be out side before, so if I were you I would just set it outside and it will naturally find a warm place to go besides there wild animals and if Your house wasn't there it would find i way to make it just like all the other thousands of wild mice. So for your health i would just let it out side but if you must keep it and might even get sick try to find a little bug catching cage or if you have an aquarium build a top. another thing to try is a cage made of lego and lasts there's always a pet Store that can sell you a cage because they probably sell rodents any way good luck.
7bnQmXksaa	Here are some choices for a good guard dog and easy going personality    1.Based on your requirements I recommend   German Shepard. Regardless of what the other person I read wrote to you a LAB is not a guard dog and it is a working dog, they work as Seeing eye dogs and bomb sniffers, Labs are great fun smart dogs however they are not considered protection dogs. With a Shepard you will have all the intelligent traits of a lab with a much more protective dog who will be great with kids. As with all dogs you will need to train him/her but you will find them easier to train then most breeds and they are usually  smarter as well. They do shed and they will require more grooming then some other protection dogs. As a first dog I think you will find them loving and fun. I personally have 2 rotties, 1 Shepard and a french mastiff. I like the Shepard the least for me as they are not as big and not as strong, however as a 1st guard dog you will love them. the others are not for a first time dog owner as they require more attention and more training.|`|0g0PZmXYaa	I agree with the first answer(: german shepards are big babies, but they won't let anyone hurt you. Another good choice would be a Shetland sheepdog or a collie. Collies get pretty big, but very protective, and the shelties LOOK like a collie, but a sheltie is it's own breed. My sheltie seems to be afraid of people, and he let's me know when someone is outside or coming up the driveway. I'm pretty sure he'd do some damage though if someone broke in.. Any dog probably would(: good luck!|`|dRUgXlOLaa	German Shepherds are good with children.  They are loyal and easily trained.  They are also very smart dogs.|`|8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	Little dogs: any quiet dog that isn't prone to barking. I don't recommend a terrier for anxiety issues.    Medium dogs: Border Collies are hyper; Golden Retrievers are EXCELLENT...and very good with children, but can be protective.     Large/XL dogs: Newfoundlands are my top pick, then St Bernards, and Great Danes.     Top Recommendations: Golden Retriever and Newfoundland|`|z3QsWmzpaa	i heard that bichon frises where good but i dont know sorry go on this website i didnt read all of it sorry but i think it will help http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/2...|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Do not get a German Shepherd.  They are a working breed, not a companion breed.  I would recommend you get another Lab.  The REASON people go to breeders is to ensure a healthy dog.  The breeder my cousin got her dogs from guarantees the health of the animals.  They will not have GI problems or hip displaysia.  Very important.  If you go to a reputable breeder that guarantees the health of the animal, then that's fine.  It's going to cost you, but you'll have an animal with the exact temperment and health that you expect.  Mutts are WONDERFUL dogs, but there is no way to know what you're going to end up with.  If you are getting a dog to help with health issues, then I'd recommend a pure bred.    Then again, you sound like a young kid.  You do not have the money or ability to buy a pedrigree dog.  Pure bred is totally different than a pedigree dog.  Just because a dog has a pedigree doesn't always mean much either.  It took me three years to find the right breeder for my future dog.  I've been waiting for the last two years for my dog to be born.  Haven't found him yet, but when the time is right, I'll get my dog (white German Shepherd, by the way).  My dog will be a working dog with specific tasks, so it is important to get exactly the right dog.    For you, dude, go to the pound.  ANY dog is good for anxiety (except Pitbulls, Boxers, Huskies, etc).  The reason to look into breeds is you don't want a dog that is an independent soul/escape artist (Shiba Inu, Husky, etc) because a dog that wants to roam the hills and run away will cause you MORE anxiety.  Just get another lab.|`|tXT63mFtaa	German shepherd dogs ( GSD's) Are perfect they are loyal protective and adapt eaisily, Ours is great :D    They are also intelligent and responsive hers a site with some info :  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshephe...    Also they are gorgeous , I also have a 6 year old sister and he loves her to bits, she can pull his tail and alsorts lol ( But she doesn't hurt him )|`|MYa0AIN1aa	I wouldn't suggest getting a dog for protection. Teaching a dog to attack intruders can backfire and will if you're not careful. You should never teach a dog to be aggressive. Specific breeds cannot be listed as you cannot judge the temperament of an individual dog on breed. Much like you cannot base personality of a person on race. If you would really like a dog to make you feel safe I would recommend rescuing a big, black dog. Large, dark colored dogs get adopted the least from shelters because people think they look scary. A larger dog barking at your window will look more frightening to an intruder than a smaller one. I would say you should get an alarm system. Just to be safe. I know how you feel, I'm very paranoid, but my dogs make me feel safe. Even though they could not attack an intruder (they all sleep in crates or in bedrooms) I feel safe knowing my alarm would go off and they would bark like crazy. Which isn't always the best behavior, but you can break the habit if you want. Most dogs will adjust to smaller children if they know them from the puppy years. Good luck and don't sweat it!|`|GroGnXTOaa	A german shepherd or a korean jindo both protective    german shepherd: loyal and energetic    Korean jindo: very loyal to their master and family very protective and intelligent. Will always be by their master no matter what. Story has it that the owner of a jindo went hiking one day with his jindo and fell down a cliff the jindo stayed by his side until his body was found(5 days) it protected his masters body and even starved. Another story that made it to the headlines that the owner of a jindo sold the jindo 160 miles away to a new owner and in 3 months the jindo came back wounded from the journey back.
masYIMRWaa	Well, if it is a minor cut and if you don't want to spend money on the vet. You can go to the local pet shop like Petsmart or Petco or PetsVet ...and get a botle of Alum or powder to stop bleeding...and put it where blood is coming out.

They would like some warmer area such as a basement or a slightly warmed garage.|`|AA10421992	I have 5 dogs and they are all inside dogs all year long.

wrUsMG4Jaa	Was the cancer that the original dog died from due to environmental factors or genetic? THAT would weigh greatly on if Lancelot II will eventually contract and die from cancer.    I personally would never clone a dog. Yes, it would have the same temperament and looks as the previous dog, but there is no way on EARTH that it would be my 'old' dog.    To get the personality that the first dog has, the clone would have to live exactly like the first dog- which (for me, and most other people) is impossible.    ADD> Just a thought- what happens when we start freezing DNA of children, and by some freak accident the child dies, and we clone that child? We have a living being that is aware that its a 'replacement' for the first. How immoral is that?|`|AA10029366	Wellllll....cancer is one of those genetics vs. environment things. Unless you know for a fact that the Lab's bloodline is predisposed to it, you can't necessarily call it genetic. Did Lancelot's littermates die from cancer? Did his parents? Their siblings? Their parents?    It's almost one of those "If any dog lives long enough, it will die of cancer" things. Our world is full of toxins, and plenty of people put them into dogs without realizing it.    If Lancelot lived a good, long life, it is probably worth it to his owners to do it again.    That said, I don't see the point in cloning dogs. Evidence shows that cloned dogs are never "replicas" of the original. They can have different markings, different temperaments.|`|cETQuE9waa	I am not into the whole cloning thing.  I would never have a dog cloned.|`|qSr6XKX0aa	Putting all religious views aside, i think Cloning a dog is acceptable, the god nuts will hate it|`|hjjmcbbPaa	thats taking stem cell resarch to another level my man|`|zjNidefBaa	Cloning is just wrong, humans and animals are meant to reproduce as nature intended, not in a lab. It's not the same, the genes are not right. Thats why they always die. It's sad for the actual clone having to go through with it.|`|7vJNHaskaa	If the first died of cancer then no...but if it was pretty healthy then maybe...    But...what's the point of cloning anyway? It doesn't make sense to me. Or am I missing something?|`|iXijnCxOaa	I'm going to argue both sides of the issue:    1) I'm not keen on the notion of cloning... I think its a slippery slope from cloning dogs to cloning humans for replacement parts.    2) While cancer can be a hereditary issue, it can also be environmentally caused... so that, in and of itself, would not be the deciding issue - however, it has been recently proven that environmental insult to the body and age cause cellular change in the DNA/RNA~ this being so, taking cells from an old dog means that the cloned animal starts at a disadvantage.    *******************    Since cloned animals are not duplicates of their source, I find it a pointless waste of time/money from a dog owner's perspective.  From a scientific perspective, I'm much more ambivalent.    (having lunch with a bunch of geneticists and biologists on an ongoing basis is an interesting thing)|`|YfFFzOw1aa	I think it is a cruel thing to do, it takes your uniqueness and your Identity away from you, I hate the idea|`|6nVDPBVsaa	I don't understand why, they are going to spend thousands when the poor dog will last only a few years. Remember Dolly the Sheep, she didn't last as long as the life expectancy for a usual sheep. It is probably expected that the dog will develop the same way as the original one, but you can never tell it will be exactly identical in life patterns.    Nothing is wrong with the cloning itself. But it's definitely not a wise thing to do.|`|ISKM1z8iaa	I think that cloned animals are more likely do die young, eg from cancer.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its possible since Lancelot v.2.0 is a direct copy of the original that the pup can develop cancer. As to is it right? I would never consider cloning any of my dogs that have passed on no matter how they died.    It wouldn't be the same animal and trying to recapture that is fruitless. I would just adopt or buy another of that breed.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	how do they clone it i dnt get it :s but no i dnt think its right just get another one . sad loosers who do tht lol. plus y dont we go around cloning ourselves or dead family members im confuzled ha ha
xAMgeUXpaa	For bedding, I use a double layer of newspaper and then I put this stuff called crittercare over it. I got it at walmart, but you can buy it in bulk at PetSmart. I like it because it controls odor, it isn't has hard on the piggies feet as wood chips (cedar and pine can actually damage your piggies liver), and I only have to clean their cage once a week. You can use a ferret hammock for the piggies, just make sure to hang it low. My pigs are too big for toilet paper and paper towel rolls (even when you cut them) so I got that black plastic drainage tubing. They have it in places like Home Depot and Lowes and you get long pieces for pretty cheap.|`|BDZc91Gzaa	paper towel rolls toilet paper rolls! they gnaw on them so its no work for you (but gathering it :)) and it helps there teeth and its good bedding+ its a toy!!! all foe free to! its amazing!! i know for sure that it works with gerbils|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	I would start with Cedar wood chips for the base flooring, yes some news paper is good to, also mine liked it when I put in some rolls from the used up toilet paper, they love to chew them up, this will also help them keep there teeth sharp. Do get those little tunnels to explore in they love those to.  Good Luck!
LVbhPH35aa	Actually pine isn't good for them either. It's just as fumy as cedar so I defiantly recommend switching. The regular grey CareFresh is dusty and can hurt their lungs. CareFresh Colors is more expensive, but it's worth it. It's not dusty and it absorbs the oder well so it doesn't stink much. I also recommend Eco Bedding it works, but it's not as good with the smell.    CareFresh Colors:  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    Eco Bedding:   http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...|`|LGDpt4jUaa	I use carefresh and it works really well. It controls the smell and my hamster enjoys using it to make a nest out of it. It absorbs well too. You're hamster might enjoy that better to make its nest because its softer.|`|va8xvhthaa	I've heard that Carefresh works really well. When I was at the pet store, I couldn't smell ANY of the stink, even when an employee opened the cage to let me see the hamsters.|`|IFvj22PDaa	I get Carefresh ULTRA and it works really well. It definently keeps the stink away :)|`|ak9DrBSwaa	You shouldn't be using pine or cedar, but could use aspen if you dont want to switch to carefresh. You could even use carefresh as a treat - we use aspen as the main bedding, but will give them carefresh in a digging box.|`|7AI58IS8aa	Yes carefresh is very aborbent, and works well. But unfortunately, expensive. You can decide to buy that bedding, or if you don't want to spend so much $ on it, you can always get aspen bedding.     It's cheap, and it works really well. Get one that says hypo-allergenic. They aren't harmful to hamsters, and if you buy a big one, it can last you very long.|`|f2e43184f1d2cccff62206e781ea39c9aa	well both work good but don't get any bedding from walmart, trust me carefresh is a good brand but it is really dusty which  is bad for your lungs, and the wood shaving a really good but sometimes they have big pieces of wood which is really dangerous for your hamster so i guess the Choice is up to you!
YYLybWHSaa	Have you ever been on  swing set and payed attention to how when you lean back your back drives into the swing's seat? When next you ask to move forward think of driving with your back and sit bones in the same way. You are pushing the horse before you by changing your center of gravity just as you do with the swing.    This does not mean you lift your legs like on the swing set. This is just the backs movement.    With your legs you ask with one leg and open your other leg or allow free movement with your other leg. This means one legs contact is firmer than the other along the horses sides. The strong contact leg urges from behind the girth pushing the traveling leg into a longer stride while the soft leg rests on the girth with the horses' weight bearing leg.    Thus you generate a strong push with your back and encourage the horse to push with one hind leg rather than the other to set off in the canter with the desired lead.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Cantering on a horse is quite easy once you have mastered the trot. when you squeeze/kick the horse on to the canter if you are riding in an arena then keep your inside leg behind the girth, and try to use the other leg to kick it on. When the horse is actually cantering, keep calm, horses can sense fear. Gently rock with the saddle, remember keep straight, keep your eyes looking between the horses ears, keep your thumbs on top of the reins, NEVER look at the ground otherwise you might end up there, lol. and if all else fails just lean back a little, the horse will do the rest. Have fun!|`|TNTFomKeaa	Is it your first time? Your instructor will talk you through it so you will know what to do.  Cantering has three beats, so it's more rocking and less bouncy than trotting. When you want to ask your horse to canter, get a nice sitting trot and squeeze your inside leg on the girth and your outside leg behind the girth. This is because cantering is like skipping and one leg 'leads'. You want your horse to lead with the inside leg. It's easier to get the right lead if you ask on a corner of the ring. Don't worry too much about it though, your horse has been cantering all his life and he will know how to do it.  Then, when your horse starts cantering (the first step is called the strike off) you need to sit up straight like you learned to do in walk. Back straight, heels down and all that. Imagine you are carrying a small child on your back. It's much easier if they don't wriggle all over the place. If you find it hard to sit at first don't worry. Just put the reins in one hand and use the other to pull yourself down into the saddle. When you are ready to trot again, squeeze gently on the reins to ask your horse to slow down. And congratulations on your first canter! I hope you enjoy it!|`|6GehblM3aa	If this is your first time cantering, the best thing you can do is relax.  When the horse enters the canter, it will seem big, fast, and maybe even scary, so if you tighten up and curl into a ball, it will only get faster and more uncomfortable.  The more you do it, the easier it will become.  Good luck!|`|7IAcCmLwaa	to sit in the saddle push ur butt in the saddle- as if u were swinging on a swing    to get the correct lead- slide ur outside leg back (this determines the lead) and squeeze with ur inside leg (this tells them to canter).    around the corners pull ur outside rein slightly (not too the point were he turns his head) this will keep him from falling into his shoulder.    make sure u arent dropping ur shoulder down around the corners.  keep it level and look around ur corners.|`|woBLf8LUaa	I have been riding for 6 years. this is what you do. Close your knee in the knee rolls of the saddle. and squeez firmly with your calfs. depending on your leads.|`|I9C7XJU1aa	everyone made good comments. the only thing i would add is if your in a ring just start out going in a straight line. start at one end, canter a line and stop. i wouldn't tackle turns or circles. hopefully you have a trainer helping you. but get your canter down in a straight line first then gradually add in a turn and going round and round....which is always fun. make sure you watch your spacing if your in with other riders.     good luck and have fun|`|38e2badf63bc911bceee6cbdbbb172b1aa	Everyone is right the other thing is be Really sure to keep your heels down because when they ride up people tend to lose their balance and its helped me to put the weight into the heel in th canter its a boat load of fun... Good luck|`|aRen4EBPaa	Good for you!!! I can remember the first time i cantered! You will ahve a blast!  Ok here are some tips.     Since you are first starting, canter in 2point position. It will help keep your heels down, and you will have more balence.   *Heels down. Balence on your heels, which means put your weight in your heels.  *Look ahead  *back straight  *shoulders back  *squeeze with your legs. Do NOT open your knee. Keep it pressed against the saddle, but don't let your leg swing around.   *Have a good rein    Hope this helps and have fun!|`|CGkgsjVbaa	= lean back  = relax  = dont sqeeze your legs into the saddle to much as some horses will stop.  = push your heels down  =sit deep into your seat  = look forward not down    And enjoy it !!|`|PdG8tIGQaa	lean back, put your heals DOWN, drive in your seat like sitting trot without stirrups.  hoped i helped!|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Lean back.

kWwgWSSgaa	No, you hit the nail on the head with your response to the situation.    Good that the owner of Pit Bull is addressing the issue of her dog's aggression. However, using your dog as live guinea pigs without first explaining that the owner & dog were being trained & *then* asking your permission, was wrong.    After one of my Dobermanns was mauled, fellow dog walkers did volunteer to be stooges & set up meetings where my dog could pass them. The difference is this was carefully controlled & the owners consented to help.                                  .|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Why even take your dog to such a place?

I've also been walking my dogs on the sidewalk, only to have a huge off-leash dog come bounding up behind me and scare the be-jesus out of me and my dogs.

I may be over reacting myself, but this woman sounds like an accident waiting to happen.  The Petsmart trainer had to come take control of the dog and she was willing to risk your two dogs as an experimental project.   Nope, I'm with you.  Smart choice to have said no and kept her dog away from yours!|`|MYa0AIN1aa	I thank you for not basing your fear on the fact he was a "pit bull". I know they can be scary sometimes. It's the owner's fault. I do believe it was a bad idea for her to suggest letting her dog-aggressive dog sniff another dog. Although, it could have been good for him. It all depends how far along in training he was doing. He probably would have been fine with just you, but he would probably dominate your dogs and a pet store just is not the place to socialize animals. If you were at a park, it would be a bit different. Less distracting, more neutral, you know. I don't think you are overreacting. You could have asked her about his aggression, but it isn't necessary. I can't say what I would have done. I would have been the woman with the scary dog. (Minus the aggressive part). People are terrified of my AmStaff because he's got a big head, broad chest, and giant jaws. But he loves other dogs and people. Cats are his weakness. he doesn't understand they don't want to play tug-of-war with the rope toy:) Anyway, I wouldn't sweat it, just please don't base accusations on breed. Thanks and good job!|`|5KB3lmUwaa	I think you handled it just right. Obviously, the woman wants to help her pet and she did ask you when she got close. I think you have to be aware of your surroundings in a situation like that where ANYONE can bring any pet into the store. If anything, the Pet Smart trainer should have gone around asking other customers on behalf of the woman before she and her dog came close.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	You are not over-reacting I wish would have said something. The problem with this owner was that she didnt give a **** if her dog attacked yours or not- your small dogs certainly werent going to harm hers. This is just another reason I dont like pitbulls- because of irresponsible people like that. If that dog had attacked would you have been able to pull it off your dog(s). I was attacked and unless you had a hammer on you the answer is no.     Should you be able to walk into a pet store without fearing for your dogs life - YES  Were you over reacting NO|`|PM23RDycaa	No you're not overreacting. I would have done the same thing. You didn't know that dog and considering what you later heard you did the right thing.|`|MBFeHS22aa	"Petsmart trainer took control over it to correct it. "  Did you not think that maybe the trainer told her to do that?|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	No you are not overreacting and you did the right thing by telling her no.  Sounds like you had the situation right, you noticed the pit fixating on your dogs. Not good.  Have you watched the Dog Whisperer?    Afterward, I think I would have talked to the store owners and the trainer about the situation, maybe one of them could advise the pit owner that her dog is not ready to "socialize" that close to dogs yet and it sounds like maybe her dog should be wearing a comfortable muzzle until the owner learns proper dog behavior techniques.|`|F0m7ey0Caa	I don't think you are over reacting. It only takes a few seconds for a fatal situation to take place.  That dog could have grabbed one of your little beloved pooches before you even knew what happened. I have seen many big dog/little dog interactions come into the vet clinic and most of the time the ending is bad for the little guy.  I personally do not own little dogs, we have a Pit/Shar-Pei mix and a German Shepherd. The Shar-Pei wants nothing to do with ANY other dog (including the Shepherd) and the 80lb. GSD's favorite play buddy is our friend's 15 lb. Boston Terrier.  I suppose I can see the woman's position of wanting her dog to "socialize" but it should have ONLY been done in a secure environment with the dog in a muzzle (like they put on Greyhounds).  That would be the safest way for her to let the dog wander and greet other dogs, so as to keep everyone safe.  As for saying something, your words might have been lost upon her ignorance (lack of education) with regards to the do's and don'ts of aggressive dog interaction and may have caused her to become angry.  I personally would have been upset and probably would have said something I shouldn't have. I often wonder why people do some of the stupid things they do.  Also, forgive me, but I don't think that PetsMart employs top of the line dog trainers. I would think that the trainer would not have allowed her to roam the isles with the dog or they should have been present to keep an eye on the situation.  As a small dog owner, you have to be extra vigilant for the welfare of your dogs (seems like you are doing a great job!) when you are out in the public because owner ignorance is high and small dogs often pay the price.  Best of luck to you and your littles!    **uh oh, the thumbs down fairy is hard at work again. I know I didn't give any but I could be persuaded to... Ha,ha!
IFiwmb3Haa	Check her paws and make sure that she didn't step on anything or got something stuck between her toes.  If you don't find anything, rub down her leg and watch her for reactions like putting away, turning her head around or whining.  It could be a muscle strain.  It also could be a combination for her weight, lack of exercise and the cold which might have effected her joints.  I would get her checked out if it doesn't go away or seem to get better in the next 24hrs.    Limping always means pain even if she isn't crying about it.|`|235185ccc037c43013533142501402eeaa	Well I can tell you my experience with that. Not to scare you but my dog is 9 and she started limping and she had swelling right around the area of the ankle on her leg. Long story short - she had osteosarcoma. Go and have it checked to be safe.|`|AA10121579	first what kind of dog is it?  I had a Bichon Frise who had the same problem found out it was just the cold|`|884f83163d9d5ff77266c433b41779baaa	Why hasn't she been for a walk in a long time? How far did you take her? If she is 8 years old and overweight and not getting exercise it's not surprising she is limping. Obvious causes are too much weight and /or arthritis.Cut down her food and take her out more often. I assume you have done the obvious and checked her feet and legs for cuts glass thorns etc.Your dog should be walked a minimum of once a day.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Check the feet right away for ice. Sometimes ice balls up in the fur (even on short coated dogs) and bruises their pads and webs. Also dogs can slip on ice and pull a muscle.|`|4WT1IBqtaa	arthritis maybe. take her for more exercise, duh!! take her to the vet or just call them.|`|WPBnurY7aa	Where did you walk her? maybe she has something stuck in her foot. you get a lot of glass in parks... check it out. i dont think not walking her in ages has anything to do with it.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Some hard realities here.    (and if anyone here says it's wet tail and to get wet tail medication they don't know what they're talking about because dwarf hamsters are immune to wet tail and the medicine will make her even sicker!)    She's old honey.      She's aggressive because she's hurt or sick If you want to try to save her, you HAVE bring her on the trip with you or find someone who can help you do the list of things below that will  help her eat and rehydrate.  These things need to be done at least every two hours, so if you leave her with someone, an adult would be best.  You'll need a trip to the store to get these items before you leave, unless you have babies (the human kind) in your house.    1. Get a baby syringe or eyedropper.    2. Buy some pedialyte.  If you can't find that, grab some honey.    3. Mix the pedialyte 50/50 with water.  If you're using honey, add a tiny bit to the water until it's just sweet to the taste.    4. Drip this slowly into your hamster's mouth.  Don't force it or you could push the liquid into its lungs - very bad.    5. If the hamster responds to this - you'll need to do it every couple hours - you can move on to the next step.    6. Get some pea & ham baby food. It's best because it has 2 proteins, starch and some simple sugars. Any kind of baby food will work though!    7. Mix it with water until it's a thin consistency that you can draw easily into the dropper/syringe.     9. Again, drip this into the hamster's mouth, and don't force it.    The hamster may actually lick the water and/or food mixtures off the syringe/dropper.  This is good.    If the method above doesn't work within 24-48 hours, she needs a vet!    I'm sorry to say that although this may comfort her some, it should have been started when she first started getting thin - but you didn't know better so don't feel bad.      If she has any chance, you need to leave her with someone that can do the above steps, every 2 hours, or take her with you!    The truth is, she's probably going to pass away very soon, just try to keep her warm and do what you can.    Best wishes|`|qGy9fR7xaa	The diohrea sounds like wet tail, and when you said you don't think she can hear or see, then maybe it's due to a small stroke, that would confuse her senses (if she's wobbly on her feet, this is a sure sign, too)  One of my old hamsters had a fairly similar thing - her eyes were droopy, she didn't appear to be able to hear clearly, and she wouldn't eat or drink, and could barely move properly. We took her to the vet straight away and in the end we found out she had a tumor in her stomach, and the sudden illness (wobbly on her feed, not eating or walking) was because of a small hemorrhage she had. In the end things got worse and she was put down :,(  These are just a few things that could be possibly wrong with your hammy! Hopefully it's not the same problem as my last hamster had with her turmour.  I'd take your hamster to the vet as soon as you can!  ~Good luck!~|`|LGDpt4jUaa	She might have wet-tail. dwarf hamsters don't usually get it, but the symptoms sounds the same. If you dont get her to a vet and get antibiotics she will die. I just had a hamster die last week of wet-tail.|`|TrEDiWR7aa	She is old for her age..  Take her to the vet..|`|gTXUcd1maa	Wet tail  and it needs to be treated right now..there is a medicine you can get at pet shops and it needs to be fed everyday for a week or more. Go to your vet as well. Until then, just, try to get the water nozzle near her so she can drink it.  Maybe a little food too. Good luck!|`|7AI58IS8aa	Sorry, that is because your hamster is old. I don't think she has much time left :(     Sorry, and i hope your hamster will be alright|`|rao4C9Yxaa	I thinks shes to old to get over something like that, sorry|`|xeQuIvx6aa	russians are known as nasty hamsters . you need to give her sugar water . take 3 tea spoons of warm water and 1 tea spoon of sugar corn syrup and use a medicine dropper and drop it in her mouth and if you have yogurt give her some but not chocolate yogurt .good luck|`|9a9D7PXUaa	your hamster has wet tail its a disease   you need to take your hamster to ther vet as it is fatal|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	wet tail. at this point you can't save her, sorry, but you can go to the vet and buy some meds for her so she can relax a bit more.
91CX5jHaaa	The difference is how badly you want to get riped off.  There is ONE standard for a yorkie.  If the breeder is striving for it, don't buy form them.  Find  RESPONSIBLE breeder.  A responsible breeder will:    1) be breeding to the breed's standard..no teacup, micro, mini, imperial,  king, or other goofy term for runts or oversized dogs.  No intentional  "rare", meaning unaccepted by the breed standard, colors either.    2) will be actively showing or working the parents.    3) will have genetic health testing done, such as OFA or PennHip, CERF,  VonWillebrand's, etc.    4) will give you the results of that testing in writing    5) insists on spay/neuter for pet pups.    6) has a contract citing the spay/neuter clause and also offering to take  back the pup at any time for any reason for the rest of its life.    7) is open, honest, and available to the new owner, and can talk aobut their  breed for hours.    8) does a home check before placing a pup, and will turn down homes that  might not be suitable for a pup of their breed.    9) does not put money above the well-being of their animals.    If the breeder you are considering doesn't fit these guidelines, fond a  better breeder.  You are more likely to get a mentally and physically  healthier pup from a responsible breeder.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Yorkies come in ONE size. O.N.E. All of the other terms you mentioned at complete crap. They are huge red flags that you are looking at a poorly bred runt from a BYB that couldnt care less about her animals. These BYBs are TRYING to TRICK you into paying more for a dog. PLEASE do more research and dont fall for their scam!!|`|qRD4sm3eaa	There is no difference. All of those words are used by BACK YARD BREEDERS or PUPPY MILLS to somehow make their puppies seem unique or special. If someone is trying to sell you a "teacup yorkie" or a "tiny toy" or "pocket size" yorkie, walk away. Only buy from reputable breeders and reputable breeders do NOT use those kinds of words to promote their pups. There is only ONE size of Yorkshire Terrier.    Try breeders.net|`|d985a6ca67c1cd9f4b34a20bd0e904f1aa	Thay are all differnet sizzes, but technically there just one size. They just diecided to name different sizzes for one size.    And if u want a full breed yorkie for that much I doubt that that will happen. Full breeds are always the most expensive.|`|iXijnCxOaa	The difference is the quality of the breeder.  No responsible breeder labels their yorkies with "tiny toy, teacup, pocket size".    You are unlikely to find a well-bred yorkie for the price you are looking for.  Buying a cheap, poorly bred dog, especially one that someone has been selectively choosing for smaller and smaller, is a great way to rack up huge vet bills which will be far MORE costly than just paying more to a responsible breeder with a more healthy dog.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	There is only one size.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yorkies come in one size -between 4 and 7 lbs.    The only way to find a yorkie for that price is to go to a breed rescue or look on petfinder.|`|bIaywrBCaa	The only one that is a true breed is just a yorkie. The others are just made up names by unscrupulous breeds. It would be almost impoosible to find a nice yorkie under $500.|`|dwHnazEJaa	The difference: The fancier names are from puppy mills, or 'Designer Doggie breeders'.    NEVER buy a tin toy, teacup, ect yorkie because they will have genetic problems.    hope this helps. and about the breeders, look at your humane society or rescue group, but you probily want to get one from a breeder..so get one with an CKC or AKC registered.    Welcome.!|`|MURxMnLtaa	None of those "sizes" are real.  There is ONE breed standard for the Yorkie.  http://www.akc.org/breeds/yorkshire_terr...|`|L22hVXTIaa	The only thing I can add to what everyone is telling you is DITTO!!!|`|b51294b275ea3556e31d66e62f7ce701aa	The difference is greed and breeders buying into the desire for itty bitty dogs that look cute in a doggie purse! The difference is the overall health of the dog as runts are bred with runts to get the smaller sizes. The smaller the dog the more risk of internal organ problems. We rescue all these small breed dogs from puppy mills. Folks cannot believe how  big the Yorkies are supposed to be and no one wants to buy the big ones. This is true of most all of the smaller breeds dogs. It is about silly vain people and what they will pay for these poor badly bred dogs.    Go to petfinder.com and look for that breed rescues and save a life!!!
R3glUmwHaa	I don't think there is a too soon.  I only have 4 goats, so I play with all the kids so they are friendly.  I play with all of my goats pretty much from the time they are born and the mothers never seem to mind (in fact, they sometimes want the attention themselves, lol).  The newest are 5 days old and already very friendly, but they know who there mother is although they did not get to interact with their mother until they were a couple of hours old (they were born by C-section).|`|IznF8H1jaa	You want to create a pecking order, make sure you are the dominate one because goats tend to be a bit on the bossy side. But, give them attention within the first week of life, and have fun! Baby goats are fun! We just gave ours away :'(
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	http://exoticpets.about.com/od/guineapig...    the above link will explain the various sounds a piggy makes.    for example... Teeth Chattering: this is a sign of an agitated or angry guinea pig and is an aggressive vocalization. It is often accompanied by showing the teeth (which looks like a yawn) and means "back off" or "stay away."    the above link also talks about body language. so check it out and it should explain all you need to know about Piggy language.|`|7SJ3cY48aa	I assume by you saying you're new to guinea pigs you mean you have just got some, and you got a pair. Am I right? Well if I am then wait until they have gotten used to their surroundings. They may not want to be split up because they see one another a protection.     If that isn't the case then they will get used to it, and learn to trust you.  Have fun :)|`|cXK9sY1raa	All my pigs did this. To be honest, I could never work out if they liked it or not - some seemed to, some didn't seem to mind either way, some freaked out. If you ever do anything that your pig really doesn't like, you'll soon know about it when they give a shrill squeak and try to get away from you, with or without a bite.|`|86evroSyaa	they hate it stop|`|YFTZM86maa	vibrating usually goes with "purring"..they like it.  If they are chattering their teeth, they don't like it.  Purring doesn't sound like it's coming directly from the mouth or teeth, so you can tell the difference.|`|uvU5DnHcaa	I can see that you have 2 boar guinea pigs and they are brothers, That is the best way of getting 2 pets, from the same litter as the all already friends.  With the sounds that they are making it totally normal when they like what you are doing. Vibrating and purring is a good sign as they are happy and content being with and with what you do.  The squeaking noise could be that he is not overly keen on having his stroked backwards as it some times can hurt them if done for too long. 1 or 2 pats backwards is fine.    I think you have found a couple of loyal friends in your piggies, enjoy their company cos obviously they enjoy yours.|`|QJOMStw6aa	when they vibrate its probably them puring that means they are happy and like what your doing    as for the chirping guinea pigs are very vocal animals and as long as the noises aren't long and high pitched you should be fine    you'll be able to tell the difference between their excited squeaks and their nervous squeaks|`|I9w1UJT0aa	Aww well it's really hard to tell with guinea pigs. Usually if they vibrate and it's a lower sound, they're purring. If they are burring with displeasure, it's usually a short and higher pitch. Aww the low squeaking just might mean they're nervous. They'll take a while to get used to their surroundings! So be patient. They'll warm up to you!    Mine never did. Bloody bastard always burrs at me and clicks his teeth. Whenever I pick him up, he either bites me or pees on me. All I ever did was feed him and try to make him comfy.

AA10972821	It sounds like the pup is trying to assert his dominance over your brother.  At ten weeks old in a new "pack" they are trying to figure out their ranking within that pack.  Apparently your pup has decided that he doesn't want to be the lowest rank and has decided to dominate your little brother.  Your brother, you and your parents have to make this dog know that he is lower than ALL of you.  Your brother should be the one to feed the dog, make it sit until he gives the okay that the dog can eat.  Also, he will have to assert himself when the dog becomes aggressive...don't remove either your brother or the pup from the situation...your brother needs to say NO very loudly and firmly and a corrective action should be taken (like making the dog sit/stay, or a short crisp tug on the leash).|`|d985a6ca67c1cd9f4b34a20bd0e904f1aa	First of all u might want to get rid of the dog. You can't take the chances of your little brother to getr hurt.     Some dogs pick a master and maybe your little brother just isn't his. Also u might want to put in what kind of dog it is because for one instance that happened with me was my brother brought home this cute pitbull home and it hated my parents and loved my brother and I. Do you have any other dogs in your family or is this puppy the only one. You also have to remember this is just a puppy you should go ask a vet if this is a huge problem or if u can fix it.|`|WnpaPlz2aa	this is odd. the only thing that i can think of is maybe where you got him from a little boy "terrorized" him or maybe your little brother hurt him in some way. not intentional but maybe. im not really sure. you could go to petsmart when they are having a training class and ask one of the trainers or you could ask your vet.     i hope that the pup comes around specially since the pup is for your little brother.|`|YCkjPJe8aa	This doesn't surprise me at all. My little brother is 10 and our dog has never liked him. He's just very hyper and I'm sure has unintentionally hurt or scared the dog. Just keep an eye on your brother and make sure he's being gentle. Especially if the puppy is only 10 weeks old, it is probably easily scared. Also, professional dog training is also something you and your family could look into. Remember, its only a baby so it may not know any better when it feels threatened.    Hope it helps (:
45N6tmWraa	Is he neutered?  Unneutered males do have a foul smell that is hard to get rid of.  Otherwise, visit the veterinarian for a check.  If his urine smells that bad, he may have a urinary tract infection.  Good luck.
91CX5jHaaa	What food are you feeding?  If the ingredient lists corn, especially in the first few ingredients, throw it out and get soemthing that has a specific meat listed first, such as lamb, chicken, fish, etc.  Corn and wheat allergies are the top causes of skin problems in dogs.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Try another vet.  Your health guarantee should cover the expense.|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	You definitely don't want to bathe him too much. That can dry out their skin and cause irritation. Did you vet mention anything about possible food allergies. That can be a classic sign.  What are you feeding him? You want to stay away from any foods that contain any protein by-products, corn, wheat, soy. Another big allergy causer can be grains. Check out your food ingredients and you may want to make a change and see if their is a difference.    A great site to refer to about different dog foods is dogfoodanalysis.com.  It gives star rating and, why it is rated that way and a review of the good and bad.    Good luck, hope he feels better soon :-)|`|TZSMO5vjaa	Well, my vet told me not to give my dog a bath too much, that it takes their natural oils off their coat.

I would try just more than one vet.|`|WLNX00c3aa	dlb check to make sure the food you are giving your pup. try switching to a different brand.  frequent baths can cause the skin to be dry and itchy as well.    find your dog a shampoo that is made for PUPPIES and that has oatmeal in it.      have you checked the area that the dog plays in? there could be irritants there as well. wash the dog beds throughly and see if that helps.|`|KtpCSyGmaa	wtf but its probably fle's get him a fle Collier and hell be Fine|`|235185ccc037c43013533142501402eeaa	He could be allergic to the shampoo and conditioner that you are using as some dogs have very sensitive skin. I would go to a dog store such as Petco or Petsmart etc and ask them if they could recommend a shampoo for dogs with sensitive skin. Something unscented etc.|`|WnpaPlz2aa	you could try an oatmeal bath. they make some specially for dogs/puppies. it might be something in your house. try to vacuum and sweep and use an antibacterial wipe all over...but don't use any "chemicals" and see if that helps. if that helps then that might be your issue. i had my pit bull for 3 years and then started using febreeze and he started doing the same thing but the other 2 didn't...well i did what i just told you...but then i started to gradually bring in the same things that i would use...one by one and then turns out once i got to the febreeze he started doing it again.   process of elimination.|`|J0dZmJo1aa	Try using tea tree oil. Rub a little on the area's your puppy is scratching. it should help.|`|HAhQ6gPfaa	I've never heard of olive oil in the food.  People normally use fish or cod oil in the food, as the Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids promote shiny coats and excellent skin health.  All of the suggestions so far are good.  Make sure you're feeding a high quality food.  My general rule of thumb is this; if you can find it at a grocery store, it's probably not good.  This is a GENERAL rule for myself, but some grocery store brands, such as Purina, are much better than, say, Ol Roy or Kibbles and Bits or Alpo.  Iams is also a decent food for those on a bit of a budget.  If you do end up switching foods, do not go from the old food straight to the new food.  Most brands of dog food have directions on the package for how to acclimate your dog to the new food.  Keep in mind that rapid changes in diet can lead to diarrhea and further stress on your pet.    The oatmeal bath and conditioner also is a good idea for your pet, but I'm not sure how effective it will be, seeing as the vet has already ruled out dry skin.  You mentioned a visit to the vet.  Has it been checked for fleas, ticks, hot spots, mange, etc?  The tip about chemicals in your home is also very good.  Cleaning with bleach is harsh on skin, and also certain pesticides in your yard (maybe from a neighbor that got washed over) could be irritating the dog.  Try using less harsh cleaners and everything fragrance free.  If none of this works, then maybe get an allergy test done for your canine.  It could be he has a corn/wheat allergy.
abNU8RQJaa	Holland Lops tend to get mats around their butt. I just cuz the mats off. the fur will grow back. If its not near their butt. Brush them. They might not be very good at grooming themselves.
Km6gOd61aa	Your hamster doesn't have wet-tail disease, also hamsters normally live 4 years if taken good care of. This is a simple problem, he could either be over-weight (this isn't very noticeable you should take him to the vet), or he is scared by something in his cage or the house when he runs around.     He could be shy and very nervous to be around you or someone in your family and you just need to make him more comfortable but it doesn't sound like he's afraid of you atleast because he was sleeping in your lap.     If you've gotten a new pet or put something new in his cage or around his cage then that could be it and you need to remove it.    Be very observan of your hamster and watch when he breathes more heavily than usual and observe what could be making that happen.    Hamsters poop more when they are very nervous like being introduced to something new like a toy or a new cage or something.    His cage may also not be big enough so you may want to look into that unless it it is a big cage but I don't nkow what he has.    Hope this helped! E-mail me with any questions at angeladddie270@yahoo.com|`|gTXUcd1maa	This could be a sign of wet tail.

Hope this helps!|`|kdCqEgpUaa	make sure he's getting plenty of water, if he isn't eating his food try giving him a little peanut butter from a spoon and see if he'll nibble at it.

So they never actually eat any of the bone.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Not unless YOU ate the lamb raw.  (NO cooked bones for dogs)|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	NO COOKED BONES OF ANY KIND FOR A DOG!!

There are things you can give your dog to chew like rawhides, ostrich legs and cow hooves.
GvoQxbipaa	There's a lot going on here but I think you should consider the following:  - have her tack checked by a knowledgable person - does it fit correctly? Is she uncomfortable and why?  - have her back and teeth checked by a vet.  - if she's ok with others riding her, maybe there is something you do that she hates? Get an instructor to watch you ride her and see if there is a problem.  - you getting tense and worried is understandable but won't help your mare - she probably has lost all confidence in you, again, a good instructor could help you overcome these problems.  - how do other horses react to you being around them and riding them? Could it be your mannerisms that scare or annoy her? (such as shouting??)  - you say you can't ride at the moment: use this time to try and sort out these problems and also to develop a good relationship with your mare by being with her, spending time with her, maybe walking her out and playing with her. Get to know her as a horse, not just a riding horse.  - once you are back to riding fitness, ride other horses for a while to get your own confidence back.  - let someone very experienced ride her for now to give the mare some confidence back.  - being 'defiant' with her will just make things worse - you can't change her by bullying her.    You obviously care for her and that is great, but you really need some help with this. Don't be afraid to admit to your own mistakes and weaknesses (we all have them!) and listen to advice given.  Hopefully it is not to late to develop a good relationship with her and in time you will be able to ride her again safely.  Wishing you the best of luck with this.|`|DDhsF8zYaa	Well do some ground work activities.    I have this book, "Knowing your horse inside and out" By Sarah Fisher (not sure ,i think that is what/who) and it has a few interesting activties .  I haven't done them, because I don't have a horse to do them with or the time.  But, you can also google things.    And pretty much just spend time with her. Maybe once you get a little respect teach her a few tricks  (kisses, bowing, etc)       Also, check to see if your saddle is ill fitting, her teeth need floating or if her back is causing her pain.|`|VyXYcCXtaa	just brushing her and hanging out with her will be great.. if you have a round pen i would work her in there a lot..and walk her around the arena... if you can have someone else ride her while you cant|`|GpMRWESUaa	Does this happen when you're riding her or just leading her?     If you're leading her then whenever she acts up & starts to back up/buck...then make her back up fast & turn her in little circles (away from you) for a good 5-6 turns or until you're dizzy. Be very stern & make sure she knows that your mad at her & this behavior is unacceptable. Sometimes I'll slap the end of my lead rope on the horses shoulder for encouragement. She has to realize that you're the boss.    If this happens when riding her, have a professional check to see if her saddle fits her correctly. Since it happens when tacking up it might be because of that. She might just be really girthy. Take time tacking her up & softly put the saddle on & SLOWLY tighten the girth.  Also practice lungeing her with & without a rider.|`|wanG4pndaa	Get a dog!|`|L0iFXjH6aa	Hi     It sounds as if you have a real problem and i have had a problem like that before so with past experience i hope you will listen and respect my answer  i think you should try natural  horse man ship because if you can gain the respect and trust that you gain through natural horse man ship on the ground  then once you have gained that trust and respect then she will start to respect you when you are riding her because as far as i can see someone has been very careless to this horses at one time or another in her live and don't take me the wrong way because i am not blaming you and in being careless the horses has lost all trust even if it way not you who did it she will still balm anyone who she has not lt lernt to trust yet ie you i hope this helps you and i hope you consider natural horse man ship     Thanks XBitzX|`|a2597c46ddff47ff43c9c7ca0f8d84eaaa	My husband's horse was the same way when being saddled. He would just go off. We had a dentist check his mouth and he had a bad tooth that the bit was hurting. We had that taken care of, and my husband inspected the blanket and saddle. There was a small nail in the saddle, don't know how that got there, but we fixed it. So he showed improvement but was still giving us a fit. The vet said he was a nervous horse, so we changed his bit and but him on a claming mixture feed. He is a new horse.|`|MUfMJYHGaa	Look to your equipment for some of your tacking up problems. Or do you pull up on the girth too fast? Do the other people who ride her use different tack? She could be having an issue with your saddle or a sensitive back.  The gate stopping is being barn sour. You have to work through this by being a stronger and smarter rider. She has your number and she knows it. Even if you have to dismount , walk her a few hundred yards and remount, make her go past that gate! Don't be afraid to "get in her face" when she's nasty. Step right up and tell her off in a loud voice. Sound like you're going to eat her for lunch.She'll be so  surprised she'll give you that OMG look and back down.  Yelo|`|AXUrSg9Zaa	By pinning her ears back at you she is saying 'I am the leader in our herd of two'.    She is dominating over you. She knows exactly what makes you timid and quiet. horses are so clever like that. When my horse started playing around with me.. I went right back to basics. I did join up with her and then did ground work for about 3 months. You have to give your mare choices and to do this you have to think like a horse. Research some natural horsemanship ground work methods. I would avoid parelli personally but it seems alot of people find his stuff useful.   Establish with your horse that you are the leader here. Once she thinks of you as the leader.. she will look to you for comfort and safety and that is exactly what a horse needs. They are herd animals and want to follow someone as this makes them feel safe.  The best way to achieve this is natural horsemanship. You sound like you could have a great partenership with your mare if you carried on with NH.. you sound consistant and unwilling to give up.    Also remember.. when she pins her ears back at you.. she is raising her energy. You have to raise your energy to match hers and some. If she comes at you then send harsh waves down her lead rope.. get bigger than her just like another horse would.    Good luck.. I hope I have helped.    Natural horsemanship, natural horsemanship!    x :)|`|WsjiPaWiaa	Well..baby her for now. dont ride her and work with ground rules with her and ground work.. build her trust and well and her building yours.

Sound liek you tense.   You a pro though no doubt.|`|AA11353999	I'd advise the following in order of preference:  1) Ask your trainer/instructor to help with the problem at the gate (when you've recovered from surgery that is). There is stuff the 3 of you can do ground work - grooming, lunging, etc. now though. However, you need the help of a professional horseman so that s/he can let you know what to do & when to do it with your mare.    2) Read & learn the methods of Monty Roberts- he's brilliant at explaining the language of horses and how they communicate with others. His training methods have helped me with alot of different challenges. I also like Ga Wa Ni Pony Boy and Clinton Anderson.     She may always be a brute when you're tacking her up- she may have been mistreated by another prior to you owning her. We sent a gelding out to a sale barn once and when he came back he pinned ears & snapped teeth when the girth went on. Just be wary yet firm when tacking your mare- say NO in a loud voice, stand w/shoulders square & look her in the eye. Get out of the way if you need to, but try not to leave panicked.    However, whenever you're riding her and she does something you don't like, then you tense- she know's she's got you! Now that you've told her with your emotions & body language, she knows the world is hers. Because there isn't a confident leader, she's become it. Or when she doesn't want to do something, she knows that all she has to do is put up a bit of a fuss & she's done working.    Start small, get professional help, and not all may be lost! Learn as much as you can about the language of horses- this will also help you in the future. If you're in the Atlanta, GA area, give me an email & I'd be happy to help for free.    Good luck!|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It sounds like she has determined that she is the leader of the herd. (providing there are no medical issues, which acting up at the gate would dismiss)    While it is unfortunate in your eyes that you are unable to ride her at this time because of your surgery, it may have been a blessing in disguise.    Have you tried doing natural horsemanship with her?  If not, now may be the time to begin.  This combined with bonding on the ground while grooming, etc will help develop your relationship.  Remember you are the herd leader even when grooming.  Act like a mare would, back her up with a serious stomp of your foot etc. letting her know behaviors won't be tolerated.    Start working on a LOT of various ground work.  Again, natural horsemanship is a good way to establish this mutual respect relationship.      If she doesn't have a problem with other riders, you could have someone else work on the saddle issues while you work on the bonding and dominance.     Here is some information on the web that might help starting your mare.    http://iceryder.net/7games.html (believe it or not, these games work wonders)    http://www.naturalhorsesupply.com/traini... (lots of information)    http://www.kersur.net/~santa/lyons.html    I can't say I agree with one natural horseman over another, but in doing research, you can find what works best for you and your horse.    Here's to great success for you and her mare.  Remember mares are more difficult.  When you gain their respect, you have earned it!!|`|KFXjRpnFaa	Get her teeth and back checked, then get a saddle fitted. If she's bucking, kicking, biting then she sounds in pain. my friend had a horse hat did that but she continued to ride him and it turned out that after three years of it he had to be put down (he'd slipped a disc in his spine)    please get your horse checked out =]    Ok, to build a relationship, try some parelli stuff. it works asolute wonders, i have been using it on my 3 year old and she's a different horse (she also used to bite and kick)    good luck|`|YsYq7BJzaa	maybe ur wearing something new 2 it i ride horses all the time so its probably some new perfume or something new 2 it
EHF8yYwCaa	Rachel is right.  SOME of those lines are just gimmicks and crap, perpetuated by breeders who don't know any better, who are trying to sell crap dogs to people who don't know any better.      If you truly want an understanding of the dogs who were actually important and influential to the REAL American Pit Bull Terrier breed, you should read some of Richard Stratton's books on the breed's history.    http://www.richardfstratton.com/books.ht...    All of the books are currently out of print, but you CAN still find many of them on Amazon....the older ones occasionally pop up on Ebay.  Among people who truly know about the Pit Bull breed, Richard Stratton is considered an authority on the breed and its history.      For what it's worth, the FOUNDATION dog for the Jeep bloodline at least, was actually a famous & influential sire.  But, MOST kennels TODAY that claim to have "Jeep bloodlines" are in reality, so disastrously outcrossed & muddy that there might be one tenative connection to that one dog, somewhere way back in the dog's pedigree.  Kind of like when puppymills claim to have "Champion bloodlines" and there are TWO champions in the 6th generation back.  Ultimately meaningless in terms of the actual puppies they are selling.      Be very wary when dealing with any Pit Bull breeder who's quoting you ridiculous prices and throwing around a lot of names of different "lines".  Usually just a money-grubber.....do your research and learn who's legit, and who's not.  Hope this helps.    Added:  Sarah brings up some good points.  There ARE still real, knowledgeable APBT folks breeding GOOD dogs out there.  Some of the lines are legit....PROVIDED you find a breeder who understands what they're doing, and WHY.  Don't get fooled by someone who tosses out a lot of important sounding "bloodline names" that you don't understand.      There is a difference between a breeder who has true Colby or Jeep or whatever, dogs, and a breeder who claims to have "Colby/Jeep/Gotti/Gator" bloodlines, but in reality has a bunch of fat curs on their yard.    Research, learn....and until you understand the breed's history, which lines are legit and HOW TO RECOGNIZE a breeder who breeds with a purpose & understands Pit Bull history, don't buy a puppy from a breeder.   There is a LOT of misinformation on the Web.  You can't go wrong with Richard Stratton's books....and if you're serious about getting a GOOD APBT pup, invest in at least a couple of his books.  If it all seems too complicated, and you just want a plain ol' APBT without all the fancy stuff, adopt a temperament-tested & evaluated dog from a resuce, like Patient Paws said.|`|TYOIHlkfaa	people just fed u bull. a couple answers were good. gator use to be a good line back in the day there the very short pits usually used for fighting, rebboy is an off brand of old family reds....all red nose pits blood isnt as strong anymore so u would be getting garbage. razors edge and gotti usually breed together but there coming up strong and fast. all these guys know is there show dogs like blue ribbon. nothings wrong with ghetto as 1 just said that where pitbulls were used and favored most and made it so populor along with the south. i usually catorgorize them as eli dogs or bolio. these people wouldnt know what that mean. but none of the dogs above u just named are ckc like these guys portaid...thats because they didnt know what they were talking about and tried to get points and im sick of that bullcrap. people expect true answers or dont answer at all. all of these dogs are apbt registered bloodlines....alot of characteristics are diffrent, colby is good but usually too tall and slinder 4 me...and as for the person sayiong  that a bloodline was crap because it had staffordshire and english bulldog in it sounded like a moron he or she shouldnt of answered ur question. because american pitbull terriers are american bulldog and staffordshire terrier mixed dogs, and u can register them like that....whos to say what bloodline is crap. i use to own a kennel with all diffrent bloodlines just for my personal pleasure.....its all what u like..big head,tall,wide chest, brains. its up to u....these bloodlines are listed in the national pitbull terrier gazette and are champion lines.......at weight pulling and diffrent other things......but i guess these guys are so preppy and better than everyone else that they only want dogs going to pedigree dog food shows, taking titles in best of show......they shouldnt speak on nothing they know nothing about because there blind and they just tried to make other breeders life work look bad because of it.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Pitbulls are not not recognized by the UKC    So just guess as to how vicious the dog might be and take your chances.

Razors Edge (especially) is a mix of English Bulldogs, Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, and more. Dangerous temperaments and poor breeding lines. Red Devil, Redboy, Budweiser Crusher, Gator, Gotti and all of those other silly 'lines' are ONLY for the 'title' product.    None of them are titled in any way (they can't be titled because the papers are forged). You need CH titled CKC registered dogs.      If you want a dog, do NOT get one from a breeder.

Gator used to be a good line, but now it's just mutts. Yes there are many different lines for Pits, you just have to know which are the good ones and bad ones. bad ones meaning they are nothing but mutts. Razors edge, Gotti, Gaff, greyline  are mutts they are not APBT. alot of the good lines are game bred lines, Colby is another great line, but are getting hard to find. Colby are usually stouter and taller then other lines same as York. Watchdog, Eli, Carver, Turtle Buster...and so on are all good lines.    I guess ALOT of people know nothing about the good quality APBT bloodlines.    Redboy and Jeep along with Colby are some of the foundation lines, how are they crap?    ADD: no those are not just fancy names, it's what your dog will have in it..learn about the lines before you get a pup, go to a REAL Pit Bull forum and look at some of those lines.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Yes, it IS possible to over do it - but you're excited and you're trying to be as prepared as possible and that's GREAT!!!!     Let's start with the top of your list - I'm only going to point out the unnecessary/harmful/dangerous items!  Save the extra money you won't spend on things you may need in the future!      You've made a LOT of great choices here!  I've been working with hamsters and hamster owners for 13 years. There are SO many hamster products/gimmicks etc. on the market.  I'm just trying to keep you from buying anything you don't need or could hurt your animal.      First and most important, are you getting a Syrian (teddy bear, panda, golden) or are you getting a dwarf hamster?    Dwarf hamsters should never have honey sweetened treats, yogurt drops, any commercially sweet snack or fruit as they're prone to diabetes.    "sam zeroder control" - you won't need this as long as you do weekly cage cleanings like I'm sure you will.    "small pet cage cleaner" - just use vinegar and water and rinse well, any chemical based cage cleaner can be toxic, no matter what the bottle says!    "2 cages" Why not make a bin cage out of a HUGE plastic bin.  It's what most breeders (and myself) recommend.  They're inexpensive, easier to clean, you can put LOADS of toys in there (which is great by the way!) and all you need to do is poke a zillion air holes in the lid!  It'll cost under $15 for a gigantic plastic bin at any big store like target or walmart! With all the stuff you have, you're gonna need more space than two connected cages, even with the levels and ladders, and you can put so much more in a bin cage!    "super pet critter shampoos aand sprays, super pet hamster clean wipes"    NONE of these products are safe for hamsters! Not one! Never wash or get a hamster wet, never shampoo a hamster or spray it.  They don't need clean wipes as they're quite clean animals on their own.  If you want to let them have a "bath" use Chinchilla bath sand (not dust as it can harm their lungs) in a bowl and stick them in it, they know what to do!    "Super Pet? Hamster Potty , super pet hamster litter" Litter training is virtually pointless.  There will be some who say (and yes it can) that it can be done.  But hamsters usually only do their business in one spot anyhow, so if you clean regularly - why try to force them, unnaturally, to use a "hamster potty."    "Oasis? Wet Tail Plus? Preventative Tablets ,Oasis? Vita-Drops? for Hamsters"     The wet tail preventative is dangerous and unnecessary - as long as you give your hamster time to adjust and don't stress it out - it won't get wet tail.  If you get a dwarf - they can't even GET wet tail.    The Vita Drops are unnecessary because as long as you feed your hamster properly and give it fresh fruits and veggies and such (unless it's a dwarf - no sweets, even fruit!) you don't need them.  They're a gimmick.    As far as the car and hamtrac - they're hard for the hamster to move freely in, and can cause problems with their backs.  Just put the hamster in a regular ball (it's on your list!) and let it run freely, just be sure to keep an eye on it.    The most important thing I can tell you is this.  When you get your hamster, put him or her in the cage and don't try to pet or touch it for at least a WEEK.  Yes, I know this is hard! It's your new baby, you want to love it, but they need adjustment time.  You can change the water and add food, but please please don't try to hold or pet it for at least a week.    I'm always available for advice, if you have questions, please msg me!|`|M9o5WpOqaa	What's wrong with overdoing it? You obviously are well prepared for your new hamster and have invested a lot of time and thought into it.I think your new little friend will be honored to have you as his/her owner.|`|1w3mwUJ4aa	No silly. THe more stuff you get the more stimulus your animals will have. Plus the more amusement you will get by seeing them. Good for you to care so much about animals.     And the only way you will know if it will fit will be the type of cage you get. Bigger cage more stuff for them.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	you dont need a lot of the toys (tv and maze) and also dont worry about cleaning your hamster because they do that themselves. the toys may make the cage look fun but your hamster will probably just chew on it and the plastic isnt good for them.|`|e4aR7naDaa	I have two hamsters and I love to spoil them with a bunch of stuff. But, I don't like when I spend my money on something and then they don't use it. Everything that you listed up until the Potty is good. I strongly doubt that they hamster is going to use that hamster potty. My two didn't. They like going wherever they can go even though it's messy.  I guarantee that your hamster will love all of the nice things you're willing to get him/her but I don't think you should worry about all of the treats just yet. Maybe when he or she is running low on some food, then go out and restock.  Two cages for one hamster? No, don't do that. All of the supplies and the cage will already cost over 80 dollars. I suggest getting one cage (Critter Trail is best) and then get connectors to make the cage bigger and you can keep adding on and on.  Oh, and hers a thought, look at the panda hamsters. I have a panda hamster named Isaac and he's very VERY good. He isn't skittish, he doesn't bite me, he isn't messy. He sleeps with me and he doesn't run off. Sometimes, I even let him rome around my room. Panda hamsters are very trustworthy.  Here is what they look like:  http://www.mikescritters.com/critters/ma...  Hope everything goes well :)|`|d2iCqQY0aa	I doubt that your hamster might not use it all (the toys and stuff like the tv and etc) but I like how you care for your future hamster. Its a good thing that your buying different snacks and chews and food for your hamster for a variety but I think you can take a few items out. Just don't buy the sprays and shampoos if you need to wet your hamster because it's bad to give them a bath, etc etc. Unless you can afford the others then go for it.

I myself have a pit bull pup and really unless your giving your dog steroids... her size will depend on her genres. So check out the parents/ancestors and you'll have an idea of what she'll be like.    By the way, I'm very happy that you are in agreement that dogs are the way they are because of the way the owner treats them or trains them. All my dogs have had training for behaviorbut that's it, and they have all been very friendly and lovable family dogs.  Also yes, punish the human, not the dog.|`|AA12149194	. , ?|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Well good luck getting any answers on this-- the object of owning a dog is NOT to make them bigger...    They are not leash ornaments.    If your dog is healthy-- in shape, you'll get compliments, regardless of how large it is...    REAL American Pit Bull Terriers are supposed to be tall, slender, atheletic dogs, not short, stocky and overbearingly large animals.|`|s5nSK7wMaa	Feeding your dog what horses eat is crazy. Horses are herbivores and dogs are carnivores. If you really want to feed your dog really good food that will prolong his life and give him the nutrition he would have in the wild you should feed him a raw diet. Nature's Variety makes a great raw diet, it's frozen and you take out patties as needed. It's more work but the payoff is worth it and you will notice immediate improvement. Here's a great site that will help explain the process.  http://www.naturesvariety.com/    Just remember, your dog wants to eat what he would naturally eat in the wild. That's what his system needs and it's very unfortunate that most people are feeding processed road kill/rancid dry food which is shortening the lifespan and causing obesity in many pets.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	If you are not planning on fighting your dog, then why do you care about it being aggressive, or "cocky" as you put it? You want it to be a ticking time bomb that may injure a neighbor or a child or YOU? You talk about your previous dog being "gentle giant" like it's a bad thing, like you loved him in spite of it. It sounds like you are not someone who has anyones' best interests at heart except your male ego.    And you should really consult your vet about any sort of diet for your pet. Being healthy and looking like "a big healthy dog" (in your opinion, anyway) are two different things.|`|hXpLwnUHaa	there is nothing wrong with wanting to ad size to these dogs at all.any one who disagrees with that statment is wrong whether they like the sound of that or not.i am not sure wat suppliments or natrual ways there are to beef him up are but your local vet will be well informed with wat is safe and good for your dog.the dog was origanlly bred for its build and size and looks good bulked up,as long as its for u and not fighting,i have american bulldogs and love the sheer size and power and we find that with regular exercise and playtime that they build relativley big muscles as it is,also stuff like wieghtpull and events can strenthen muscles,can not stress enough as to do it responsibly as u could hurt the dog if its not done properly.|`|Bg8GUC81aa	A got a pitbull puppy 5 years ago (still have him). I tried feeding him all kinds of different things, because I wanted him to be big and stocky like those dogs on those web sites. Instead he got fat. Also be careful trying different things you might want to gradually mix it in with the usual dog food. My dog got so constipated. The shape and size of his head, chest etc is going to be predetermined by his genes and I don't think you can change it. If you keep him healthy he's just going to turn out how he was bred. So to answer your question no I don't think it's what they are being fed.
AA10669025	Your kitty knows that if she plays with your nose she will get attention.  Sounds like she has got you trained very well {LOL}.  You might try ignoring her, pretend you are still asleep, and roll over.  Give it a little bit of time and see if her behavior changes.    I have added a couple of informative cat training/cat websites for you.    Good luck to you and your furry friend.|`|vwTyihvvaa	She wants attention.

If your boxer is still chewing stuff up when you're not looking he isn't ready yet.|`|AA12128656	well if he's only chewing paper, and you believe he won't cause any other problems, i'd remove any paper from the areas that he has access to, and make sure he has some really great toys to play with. kongs and peanut butter (or a big raw bone with peanut butter) are some that will keep him busy a while.  i'd recommend that someone let him out to potty halfway through the day and check on him  keeping him semi-confined (1 or 2 rooms) is best to start.|`|aCqSF87Raa	When he stops finding and chewing up paper. Just because a dog is potty trained doesn't mean they're ready to be lat loose in the house when no one is around. He could still get into trouble: paper may not be the only chewable thing he gets in to.    But as far as trials to see if he can be allowed SOME freedom go, start SMALL. Section off ONE room of the house with baby gates. Remove anything edible and be prepared to clean up a mess or two. Only leave him be for, say, half an hour or less. Then as time passes and he doesn't mess or get into trouble, gradually increase the time you leave him.    You don't HAVE to let him have full run of the house, even with you there. My friend's dogs are not allowed upstairs, and my dog is kept mainly in the kitchen/family room with us.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	It's not necessarily the age of the pet.  You can let him roam but you should monitor him.  Make sure you remove and pick up things that your dog could eat or chew or make a mess of.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	You have to just watch him and correct unwanted behavior..replace the paper with a toy and stuff like that.|`|b5WRitsZaa	usually dogs start getting mature around the 2 yr mark...i dont think there is a certain age to start letting them roam, its just your own discretion.  start doing trial runs...for example if you just have to run somewhere and you'll be gone for 30 minutes or less let the dog stay out and see how it acts...if it chews stuff up then maybe its not ready to be left out just yet.|`|TZSMO5vjaa	Oh cool, I have 2 boxers!!      *I let my boxer roam the house after I gained trust with him,  Ex: Him not chewing shoes and furniture  I let my dog out of the crate at 8 months    **Boxers rock! :D  -Good luck with your new boxer  Syd
s6YmD7vaaa	Your dog's crate should be his "safe haven."  Using the crate for punishment will destroy his feeling of security in the crate.  Plus, he won't know what he's being punished for b/c dogs don't respond to punishment.  Better to reward the dog's good behavior with praise, affection & a treat, and ignore the dog when he's behavior is unacceptable.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	It's fine. As you pointed out, it is much like a child being sent to his room. I don't know any children who end up hating their rooms because they have been sent there as punishment. As long as there is enough history of positive experiences with the crate (sleeping in it safely, getting treats and toys in it), the dog is not going to end up hating the crate. The punishment is being separated from the pack; it doesn't matter where you put him.    One point: time outs (which is what you are using when putting him in the crate for punishment) are really only effective for attention-seeking behaviors. So, for instance, you can put him in the crate as a time-out for barking at you when you are on the phone but you shouldn't put him in the crate for chewing the table leg.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	I think the crates are used just for potty training. Try using the dogs bed for anything else. Go buy one at Walmart, my dog sleeps in it all day/night!!|`|uEs6VwyIaa	no way not punishment     i use a crate like the dogs room     a place to chill out and sleep in but i always keep the crate open     never ever for punishment|`|AA12059542	i just  got a puppy and i only use his crate for when i have to go some where i cant possibly take my dog,and for bed time to prevent any accidents.i don't think that it should be used for punishment because you are making the crate a negative experience at that point. never a good idea!|`|b5WRitsZaa	i would say no...especially if it is the same crate you use daily while your at work...b/c then its not going to know if it in trouble or not...if you really wanted to do this route i would buy another crate and keep it in a different place in the house...but whatever you say to the dog when its getting locked up before you to work, use a different word for when it is in trouble so it doesnt get confused|`|ktqroat6aa	yes. that is the way we trained our puppy|`|DslJcQP5aa	yea that's cool. it is usually used for house training. once your dog is house trained people usually get it a bed but if it misbehaves you can send it to the crate as a form of punishment|`|hfU9hIjXaa	you don't want to associate it as a punishment room when you also use it for everyday use because then he will think he is doing something bad when you put him in there just to keep him secure.    you should invest in a tie-down you get an eye hook and put it in your wall and buy a tie down from your local humane society store or petco or petsmart or pet food express and hook him onto that when he is misbehaving. it's only a couple feet long so it lets him have enough room to lay down or sit or stand or get water. this is what i do with my dog and it teaches him that when he is misbehaving he needs to calm down, it works really well, it is what the dog trainer of my puppy class suggested|`|uIFmBotKaa	NO! because when you go to work he will think he is in trouble when he's not.    Haha.  I hope this helps! :)    It is okay to use this method if you didn't put him in it while you were at work. If you do this, the poor dog will think he has done something bad almost all the time, and he will not know what he did. Then his behavior will change and not for the better.  :)|`|XRxLZYFwaa	A crate should only be used as your dog's "safe place" - the place he can go to when scared or when someone is bothering him. If you use it as punishment it will make it a negative place for him and you could encourage separation distress.
aZoCKGciaa	I have had couples of mice and rats. When one dies it is noticeable to me that the other one is depressed. They stay in their homes, they don't eat very much. Their personality changes. They definitely do grieve. They just lost their only companion that they saw everyday. They don't really have anything else then their friend. Rodents sleep, play, and eat with each other. They groom each other and take care of each other. I remember when one of my rats was dying, the other one got noticeably nervous. She kept going over to the other one to sniff and nudge her. And after she died, the rat became totally different. Very secluded. I would get your mouse another friend of the same sex. But if you do, introduce them slowly so they have time to get use to each other. Like give them play times together. Then slowly move them in together. I think your mouse will feel much better after time if you do that. Good luck :)  Oh also, maybe in the mean time give your little mouse some yummy treats like peanut butter to help lift his spirits. :D
yjNoIzGBaa	You are right rabbits need friends.  Most mammals are social animals.   Your rabbit does need a friend.  I believe that all pocket pets including rabbits, ferrets, mice, rats etc  should not be isolated.  There is proof that most mammals will live a longer better life if socialized with at least one other.    SO DO ALL THE RESEARCH YOU CAN ON RABBITS AND THEIR SOCIAL HABITS YOU WILL FIND THAT MOST RECOMMEND SOCIALIZING.  PRINT IT ALL OUT AND SHOW YOUR PARENTS.  YOU CAN ALSO BUY OR RENT FROM THE LIBRARY BOOKS, MAG ARTICLES REALLY ANYTHING WRITTEN THAT HE NEEDS A FRIEND.  You can also call around your city to vet that see rabbits and get their impression of what is recommended.  good luck convincing them|`|Xe406LfYaa	Tell them that eventually your rabiit will become depressed and die, or just buy one yourself.|`|IxD8aNHTaa	steal one. or...say your rabbit some hoe magically had a baby.|`|Q87djE0laa	putting another rabbit with your other rabbit doesnt mean they will get along. rabbits are  very picky who they like  try saving your pocket money and buy your own but dont expect them to like each other|`|yLmeZMTWaa	I have this same problem, all rabbits need company. You aren't supposed to keep them by themselves but my parents won't let me have another one either. I can see their side, but I still want another!     I'm just being extra helpful around the house, begging, getting good marks at school, begging, making really valid points about why I need another one, begging, hinting, begging, and just trying to bring them round the my way of thinking.     Good luck!!!|`|uEwOHM6Baa	i love rabbits they are so cute here is the best thing to do: as you want another rabbit that must mean you have one already therefore keep playing with it and telling your mum and dad how much you love him. Also say that when you leave him sometimes you feel bad as he is getting left alone drop A lot of hints.  Also im sure you probably already no a lot about them but go on the computer and look up stuff like interesting facts and then keep showing your parents.   they will see that you really care a lot about rabbits and maybe reconsider. Hope this help :D
YFTZM86maa	Try going to a gas station or other store.  They get large signs for outside that are usually made of coroplast.  They get them free and often toss them away when they are done with them.  No hurt in asking.  You will end up with a large piece of free coroplast and help the environment as well.  Be sure to score the material so that the printing is on the outside.    You can try those other stores, but I've only seen small ones the size used for election signs or yard sale signs.

To make something boring seem exciting, poke holes in it and have food sticking out, hang things up with twine (make sure you remove the twine after), twist up paper shreddings and hide treats in it.

WAilZ39maa	Well, I'm just a little monkey, but I'll try my best. Just be really nice to her. Teach her you're not mean. Play with her, make sure you're the one to feed her, don't ever yell at her, even if she attacks your leg. A really good thing to build a bond is sometimes to just sit with her and pet her for a long time. Usually it will take a few minutes but she should start purring. Tickle her and just do everything to make her happy. If you have other cats, pet them around her so she sees that the other cats don't hate you or anything. If she attacks your leg, gently push her away instead of screaming and running away. She might just want to play - distract her with a toy or treat (I personally like bananas). Cuddle with her on the couch and don't ignore her.     I hope this helps and good luck!    -Monkey Girl, the female monkey|`|tdJpnyF9aa	get some catnip and let her have some as you pet her to give her a possitve experience with you... and to show you are not a threat...|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Just ignore the cat for now. Feed and give her fresh water every day and clean out her litter box daily, some cat just hate a dirty litter box. Talk to her in a soft voice and she should come around. Don't try to force anything. Oh, by the way, if you the got kitten in Dec. 2007 shes no longer a kitten, she is a full grown cat.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	some animals just do that they dont like some one thats wat happened to my dog but if you give them treates and show them u wont hurt them she might like u....|`|jez0O0bXaa	Cats are very independent you need to let them just come to you. She's playing when she attacks your leg.  She cries because you pick her up on your terms not hers. You need to relax your energy and act like you don't care she will come to you.  Females are a little more distant than males.|`|U2HVLwr3aa	meh  you can't make cats love you, I don't think she hates you. my cat attacks my leg to play, and she's probably doing the same. It takes a while for a cat to warm up to you, just respect her space and give her treats.

I'm going through that right now and totally understand. I thought about getting a small tattoo but what I ended up doing is having him privately cremated and I keep his ashes on a shelf next to my bed. I didn't want him buried outside rotting away in the ground. And when I move I would not be able to visit his grave site.
ZT0K3q2Aaa	Maybe if you cremate your dog, you can plant a small tree in your front yard, and use her ashes like dirt, to help the tree grow. This growing tree, this growing life, would be in memory of Prancer|`|wS9TkFcvaa	I would definitely get a tattoo of his name but chances are you'll have to wait until you're 17 or 18.  You could even get a portrait of his face it would be a bit bigger than just a name but would be way cooler! I know someone that had the same thing happen to her and she got a tiny paw print with the dogs name under it. There's just a few ideas. I hope I helped. Sorry for your loss.
YqVtOSWwaa	I would say she is definitely pregnant. The bulges on he sides seem very protrusive and uneven on each side. It looks like she is close to birth. Mice gestate 19-21 days usually.    If she was obese, it would be more subtle, and she would be overall squishy, not just around her belly. Plus, I do not think she could have put that much weight on in the short time you have had her. On top of that, if she had been living with males at the store and when you had her, there is actually hardly a chance she is not pregnant.|`|AA11989570	Well I'm not an mouse expert, but my friend told the way the mouse is pregnant if her belly is really round and sometime the female mouse eats a lot too.

Do they keep the males and females in the same cages at your pet store? They do at the ones we had here. She may have been pregnant when you got her. Little baby mice are so cute. If she is pregnant, enjoy the babies and the mothering process of the mouse, its neat to observe.|`|N5MjOIXsaa	too hard to tell, wait a little bit longer and see if she gives birth, that's the only way to tell.
XmJZkFuMaa	Well... if it was me, I'd do one of a few things.     Find a declawed rescue cat or put off getting a cat until I moved to a new place.  Or I would try to talk to the apartment manager and try to convince them that if I keep soft-claw claw-covers on the cat maybe they'd make an exception, and explain your moral objections to mutilating the cat.    I know you said you searched for a declawed cat already.  I would keep looking.  Call cat rescues, call rescues that specialize in cats who's owners are dying or dead, call your local pound and find out if they know of cat rescues.  I know in my area there are 4+ cat rescues and they do have declawed cats come through all the time.      Otherwise, I'd just wait.  A year isn't that much to wait.  Since he's in the Marines, he may prefer having a kitten or cat that he'll have more time to be around.  And he might want to move once his time's up.|`|VMY7No0eaa	I don't think they can do this.    contact PETA and report them... THEY WILL STOP IT!    Also go online and find the site that tells you all about declawing (I have it on another computer but not this one) PRINT IT OUT and give it to the management.    I really would move from a place like that!|`|y8HyP1bzaa	Move out of your apartment?  I don't know what to tell you.    ETA:  Declawing isn't that bad.  When my kitten was declawed, my vet told me he might be sore, etc.  What crap that was.  He came home and was leaping around like normal.  No pain whatsoever.  So don't listen to everything you hear.|`|rS7fh6pRaa	I think its stupid you apt complex only allows declawed cats.   They should allow Cats Period..

Those seem to be your only options.     I am against declawing myself.|`|Uy79dKEmaa	I don't believe in declawing, but there are already declawed cats that need a home.  You probably won't find a very young kitten since declawing usually wouldn't occur until about six months.    Petfinder.com has an advanced search that will show you only declawed cats.  I did a quick search for you based in the MCAS area (I looked at your profile for your location).  It looks like there are several you might be interested in:    http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.c...    I hope this helps!|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	It doesn't sound like there is any way around it.  You are doing the right thing by looking to adopt one that is already declawed.  Keep looking.  Please don't declaw a cat, they amputate the tips of their toes and it is so painful.|`|4k5NJN29aa	I don't want to get you kicked out or anything, but really, how strictly is that enforced? Is somebody going to come over, exert pressure on your kitty's paw pad, and see if claws come out?     I'd just tell them the kitten's scheduled to be de-clawed the same time he gets neutered, then just don't do the de-clawing part. That's if they even ask about it.    But for sure, you'll want to invest in a GOOD, sturdy scratching post so the kitten doesn't rip the carpet or anything. Purrfectpost.com is great. I bought one and to me it's 100% worth the money.|`|tMsMiapDaa	First off, look up your local tenants laws - landlords don't always follow them and your landlord may not be legally able to require declawing.     If the law isn't on your side then talk to your landlord. Explain cat behaviour, and let them know about alternatives such as Softpaws.     You can read more about your rights as a tenant and negotiating with your landlord here: http://abnormalloveofcats.com/responsibl...    If there is no way around the declawing then I would keep looking for an already declawed cat or just wait until you are ready to move. Declawing is extremely cruel and can result in a lot of long term medical and behavioural issues, such as peeing outside the litterbox (which is much more likely to damage property than a well trained cat with claws.)    Good luck - I hope you can come to an agreement with your landlord that doesn't involve harming your future cat.
be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	I imagine she just finds knocking over drinks, shredding toilet paper, and chewing on things tons of fun. Provide her with more appropriate outlets and she shouldn't do this anymore (or as much). Cat Charmer and Da Bird are great toys. You might want to get a Cat Dancer or other toy that allows you to attach the toy's wand to a door or wall (a good alternative to the toilet paper). Give her treats or even her dry food in a Treat 'N Play or Busy Buddy Twist 'N Treat.    As far as management, keep the bathroom door closed and don't leave drinks unattended.    If the spray you mentioned was a deterrant, those are a waste. Instead, try Comfort Zone. One reason that cats scratch is to mark territory. The Comfort Zone mimics the pheromones cats use to mark - spray the furniture and she shouldn't feel the need to mark. You can also wipe a dry cloth on her cheeks and lips to pick up her pheromone and then wipe the cloth onto the places where she scratches.     If that doesn't work, try double-sided tape or taping bubble wrap to the places where she scratches.    Encourage her to use the scratching post by dangling a toy from it, rubbing catnip into it, and playing with her around it. Some cats are particular about posts. If yours is carpet-covered get a sisal-covered one instead. The post should be at least 3-feet tall. Place the post next to the piece of furniture she scratches the most.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	Toys(solo toys) and catnip. Lavish her toys in the catnip and rub the catnip all over the scratching post.|`|WAilZ39maa	EDIT: Sorry about that... I'll answer now.     1. Beverage Problem - always have a cap on your cup. Also, keep it up high where she can't reach it unless you are drinking it.     2. TP Problem - Make sure the door is always closed. See if you can get one of those toilet paper holders that are closed, and you open them, or re-install it very high.     3. Plastic Problem - This one is hard... just make sure ALL plastic small enough for her to reach is gone, gone, gone. Sorry this is all I can offer.     4. Shredding Furniture Problem - Put a bit of tin foil on the furniture she likes to scratch. When she goes over to scratch it, she will hear the noise and feel the foil and be totally freaked out. Then she will never scratch that again. Do it on all your furniture and take it off when she has learned. Also, try putting cat nip (you can buy it at your pet store) on the scratching post. It smells like nothing to humans, but smells amazing to cats and will attract them. She will be scratching that thing all day long!!    I don't think there is such thing as a cat whisperer, but I hope these methods work for you.     Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|UGY3i7BWaa	I have a cat named kitty.the stupid thing pisses and shits all over the place.rIGHT NOW HES OUTSIDE in the snow until he smartens up.No joke im serious.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	Yes you can get cat behaviourists - I work with one and they can do fantastic things.  However, I have to say that this all sounds pretty normal for a cat!  I can recommend all the Vicky Halls books (particularly Cat Confidential which you can buy on Amazon).  She is probably the most famous cat behaviourist in the UK and I find all her books well worth having and keeping for future reference.  You might find a cat just like your own in some of her case histories.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	These are behaviors that will eventually break, but you will have to give her some time.  Try not leaving beverages down where she can find them, and keep them up at a level that you're only able to see and get to.  Also, try using a safety pin or something to pin up the toilet paper, so that it will not fall down. Also, what my parents did with the furniture, is they would use aluminum foil that the cats do not like using their claws on this, and it did work for a little while.  Try also getting some cat nip and some toys, and they will maybe go after that instead.|`|U2HVLwr3aa	cat named kitty.  YOUR SO CREATIVE.    My cat was like that at first, but then she mellowed out. My cat usually tips over my glasses(and breaks them) she does this because she is thirsty or probably wants to see what it is. All you need to do is be more aggresive with her, spray water works..For a while but I notice if you yell really loud with a cat they get scared and stop. Keep doing that for a while, then reward her for being good. Part of the problem is she thinks it's okay to do that stuff, because you guys are giving her a lot of attention..    And cat whisperers, and just as real as Micheal Jackson's nose.|`|jez0O0bXaa	There are web sites that help with that look under cat behavior.|`|txFLGStyaa	I think your kitty has all of the attention she needs. If she's a kitten, she's naturally curious and wants to check everything out, which it sounds like.    My husband and I make loud noises (I don't know how exactly to explain the sound, haha) every time we see our cat doing something he's not supposed to. When he hears that noise, he KNOWS he's in trouble and he runs away usually. Try this and lightly hit her head afterwards (or something else unpleasant) until she can associate the sound with getting smacked, sprayed, etc.|`|ksFHUcUQaa	i have told you to watch your glasses before and I dont have this problem i just watch my glass and i almost always keep the bathroom door closed, joel. as far as the furniture goes i think i will try and get her a scratch post again and put catnip on it like they suggest. and she needs to stop losing all her toys under the stove! so keep your drinks in your sight and stop leaving the bathroom door open!
AA10029366	Redirected aggression. She can't go after the strange dog, so she takes it out on the dog standing next to her.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Possibly showing off.  As long as Spot doesn't mind it, let it be.|`|AA12128656	because you haven't trained her not to do that.  it's not protective. she wants to go after the other dog, but knows she can't. so she picks on whoever's handy.   discourage the behavior and you can train her not to do that.
PM23RDycaa	You can't make your parents GET or WANT a dog. You have 8 pets already you DON'T need a dog. Stop bothering your parents and enjoy the whole menagerie of animals you have in the moment.    A part of life, growing up and maturing is realizing we can't always have what we want.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you worked eight hours a day, had to pay bills and taxes every month in excess of $1,500, had to look after a child/teen and a bunch of animals, had to pay for said teen and animals, AND had to do other grown-up things... would YOU want to be told to do with your money?    ..... I didn't think so.    If mom and dad say no to a dog, then they mean no. Act like the mature, responsible, young adult you claim to be and drop the subject. Pick up chores around the house to prove your responsibility, get a job to bring in some extra cash for college and your pets, take care of your current pets even better than you do now, do more research on proper care and costs of a dog... then ask again in the summer.    You can't make an adult do anything they don't want to do. Nor should you try, especially when it comes to something that will cost a lot of money (try a grand minimum in the first month, a few hundred a month after, possible grand or higher vet fees) and will take a lot of work (feeding, cleaning up after, grooming, vet care, appointments, walking, training...)     It's their money, their choice. They may not have enough to spare or may want that money for other things. They may even be worried about being stuck with the "dirty" chores. Or all of them when you go to college.|`|ewwfcDDyaa	you can not MAKE your parents get you a dog. you can ask and do chores and show them that you are ready to own a dog. Be patient and don't be selfish, like you don't want them to think you don't deserve a dog. after awhile, hopefully they will consider getting you a dog. Maybe you could get a job to help pay for it. But you have a lot of animals. Couldn't you just be grateful for them? People have lived without dogs, they didn't die!!! You'll be ok. I wouldn't be able to live without animals though! I  don't need people, I just need my dogs and horses!!!        I for one can't possibly understand what your going through. Life without dogs???? Wow. It makes me realize who lucky I really am. I really, really hope, eventually you will get a dog.

99ea9ef1d3ccadf76a367bfdcafd8593aa	If you have a camera I would suggest you go by when she is not there and without trespassing take some pictures, then go to the local police dept and speak with them. You might also contact the local humane society as well as the stat chapter of the ASPCA or USHS. Maybe you can speak with the local DA or prosecutor and see what happens. Whatever happens do not confront or even have contact with this individual and break no laws. Good luck. If this does not help I also suggest going to your local paper and telling them your story and ask them to look into why local law enforcement has not taken action? There may be no legal action taken on this situation though so be prepared for that. Generally law enforcement only acts on the most severe animal abuse or neglect cases.|`|a2B4xP8Oaa	Is she actually not feeding them, or just not feeding them much?|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Really, the only thing you can do to save these dogs and bring her to justice is to get the law involved. I suggest you contact the local police or animal control.    In many cases animal control etc will initially try to get the problem solved without removing the animals - hence giving her some food. However, they usually state that the situation needs to change - this woman has probably been warned that she MUST feed them properly. If they go back now and the dogs are still starving they will be more likely to remove them, as they will know this woman has no intention of looking after them properly.      Good luck!
gz5O9Tbpaa	Since you have wanted one for "ages" I will assume that you have gotten a part time job after school at the local shelter or even a paper route and now have about $3000 saved up for the dog, the initial shots and boosters, the cost of getting it fixed and microchipped, the money for the food, toys, crate, flea meds, heartworm meds, tri-monthly grooming (depending on the breed), leashes, colars, tags, potty pads, shampoo, brush, cleaning products, and another $1000 set aside for emergency vet visits.     No? Then grow up, move out, get a job, and then you can do whatever you want. It's their house and their rules. Dont like them? Move out. I dont understand why kids now think they are entitled to a dog just because they want one. The economy is rough right now. People are dropping their dogs at shelters because they cant afford to take care of them anymore.    My parents didnt want a dog. Period. So when I was living on my own, paying for myself, in college, with a steady job and a steady income, I got myself a dog. It's really just that easy.|`|PM23RDycaa	They have said no, they mean no.    Their house their rules.    Grow up. Move out. Get a good job. Get a Dog friendly Apt. Get a dog.|`|aCqSF87Raa	So... you have the $200-$1,500 for the puppy? And the $200 for initial supplies? What about the $200 for first vet check? Do you have a job so that you have money coming in for the monthly fees of $100 or more? What about a way to save money for those pesky emergency fees that can soar over a thousand dollars?    ... You mean you don't? Your parents do? I thought you said YOU wanted to buy the puppy!     And what about all the chores? Like feeding it, grooming it, potty training it, teaching it manners, scheduling and keeping vet/grooming appointments, walking it, cleaning up after it, etc?    Oh, you just want to play with the dog and teach it cool tricks? So mom and dad will have to do the hard stuff!    >_    If mom and dad say no, they mean no. They work hard to pay off bills and stuff to keep your house and keep it stocked with food and clothes. Try around $1,500 a month.... or more! That's a lot of $$ and thye may not have any extra to spend on a puppy. Plus they probably don't want to be stuck with the chores.    So pick up some chores around the house to prove you're willing to do the hard stuff, get a job if you can (even if it's helping neighbors shovel driveways) to bring in $$ for college and the puppy, volunteer at a shelter to get an idea of what needs to be done for a dog, then drop the issue for a while. Ask again in the summer.    Stop whining - that only adds to their thoughts that you are not yet mature enough to handle the responsibility. Only children whine and beg. Young adults do not do these things, they accept that life means that they don't always get what they want.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	By growing up and learning that "No" means "NO".

Having a puppy requires responsibility.  Are you ready?|`|zQdYBoSpaa	Well if you want your parents to get you a puppy try saving up some of your money and tell them that you will give them all of your money if they pay the rest.

7cm4dZVaaa	It is possible that the second horse doesn't know what a kick means.  Teach him voice commands on the lunge line, and get some assistance.  Have your assistant lead him forward when you gently kick, when the horse starts walking, reward him by not kicking anymore. Have your helper walk him around some, then stop, and do it again.  A small crop may encourage the pony to move forward also.    To ground tie, start with dropping the lead rope while you are standing there.  I always ground tie my horse while grooming and saddling, for example.  If the pony moves off, return him to the original position.  If he moves forward, back him into place.  Over days/weeks you can move further and further away, always putting the pony back where you want him if he moves.  It also helps if the pony knows what "whoa" or "stand" means.|`|TNTFomKeaa	Separate them gradually as if you were weaning a mare and foal. Start by putting them in adjoining paddocks where they can still see each other. Put them in adjoining stalls, ideally so they can still touch each other. Take them away from each other to be fed and then return them to their friend. Gradually separate them for longer and longer periods.   Turn them out with other horses as well so that they can make other friends.   The pony that doesn't want to work is probably behaving so badly because he wants to be taken back to his friend. He can't learn anything new if he's in a state of fear, so go back to what's familiar for him. Try working him from the ground, starting with Join Up so that he builds more trust in you. You could also long rein him as he's a driving pony and might be more comfortable with that, progressing to long reining on a circle and then lunging. That might help but probably he will improve as he gets more used to being away from his friend. You should also consider getting a trainer to help you start off in the right direction.  I hope I helped!|`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	You are going to get many mean answers to this question - hope you're prepared.    You cannot hope to succeed until you know the basic reasons for the horse's actions - and you cannot know these reasons until you understand horses, which you obviously don't.    here's why the horses have separation anxiety:  They are herd animals - one is the leader and one is the follower - if they are separated, the follower no longer had a leader to tell him/her what to do anymore.  If they are the leader, they are having trouble becoming the follower to you.    Horses have a social structure.  any time a single horse interact with another being, whether it's another horse or a human - anything - one being must be the leader and the other must be the follower.  the horse will judge which it is based upon it's analysis of you.    A leader in a herd of horses is the one who ensures the safety of the rest of the herd, leads them to food, water, safety. For example, I have a herd of 5 together.  the leader is an old gelding.  The lowest horse on the social ladder is my 8 year old mare.  In between these two are another older gelding, and older mare and a 6 year old mare.    The leaders tell the others what to do all the time.  Before a submissive horse does anything, they find the leader and those more dominant and they judge how their action will be viewed by the others.  If I take away the leader of the group, all the others whinny for him - they now are unsure what they should do and now they must go about re-establishing who the new leader will be.  they feel vulnerable to predators and are unsure of what will hurt them.    so when you separate these two horses, they worry they may get eaten or hurt or be put into a harmful situation.  They're big wussies in need of surety of their safety.  If you haven't properly proven to them you are trustworthy, they will not view you as their leader - and you can't hope to do this without understanding how to be a good leader and allow the horse to learn to be confident in you.    A horse will buck you off because he goes into 'prey mode'.  A predator will attack the horse from above.  Their first instinct to get rid of something scary is to buck it off or kick at it.  the horse won't move because you haven't taught it what you wish it to do when you get on.  You haven't built the language.    let's put you in a different situation.  Let's say our planet gets taken over by aliens who are big, slimy creatures that roar a lot.  We have no idea what their roaring means, we don't know what they're trying to communicate, heck maybe we can't even determine where they're arms & legs are.  They come toward us, roar and look real mean.  Waht would you do?   Stand there?  run?   What if they came at you, roared loudly then struck you with perhaps a tentacle that gave you a huge electric shock - how would you feel?  they're obviously trying to get you to do something but what?    This is how your horse feels when you get on and kick.  It has absolutely no idea what you want, it only knows you're now on it's back where a predator attacks and you're administering discomfort and pain by kicking - heck, I'd buck you off too and probably stomp on you too if I could.    You must use baby steps and reward.  When you get on, focus on being calm and sitting relaxedly and quietly - allow the horse to first get used to you getting on and off.  then begin brining up your body energy - stiffen spine, sit up, squeeze gently with the thighs.  When the horse moves a few steps, relax and praise him - you've just told him what stiffening your spine and squeezing with your thighs should mean, it = "move" and you're reinforced his positive reaction - you've just established a language.    Now - I suggest you go hire someone to either train the horses to ride or to work with you and they to get them properly started - otherwise I guarantee you someone will get hurt, you or the horses, at the very least they'll dislike and mistrust you if you don't because you don't know what you're doing.

Just keep using the name every time you call her, tell her to do something, etc.  Eventually she will get used to it.  Otherwise, you may have her hearing checked to see if it could be a hearing issue.  Good luck!|`|YCkjPJe8aa	If you've only had the dog for two weeks, it may take some time for her to learn her new name. Especially if she came from a shelter and is 3 years old, meaning she has probably had other names before. Keep calling her by Peyton, she should respond eventually.    Hope it helps, good luck. :)|`|pCwIokI0aa	I think peyton is cute.  I don't think that she can't understand it, it will just take some time.  She is still getting used to her new home, new owner, and she just needs some time.  Just be sure to say her name everytime you play with her, feed her, pet her, talk to her, and especially when you praise her.  If you do this several times a day, she will have it down in no time.|`|TZSMO5vjaa	Harlee  Coco  Lilly  Sammy  Sam  Baby  Honey  Star  Moon    Maybe simple names that he can understand quicker and easier. :D    -Good luck with your new family member  Syd|`|lAPUjEwOaa	Those are all really nice names. Pick one that can be said clearly and firmly. Stick to clear sounding syllables. When you pick a name, stick with it. She will get very confused if you change her name every couple days because she "isn't getting it." She will, but remember, she is learning a lot of new things write now, be patient. Remember to stick to things, don't let her get away with things just because she is cute, or because she is small. A good reference book is "The Perfect Puppy"   Good luck!|`|vwacOJDFaa	if you've only had her for two weeks then chances are she is just learning her new name. if she was owned before being at the shelter she was used to being called another name, then the shelter changed it, and now you are. she just needs a little time to figure it out. if you like peyton, and i agree that its a great name, then just make sure she knows its her name. say it as often as you can. when youre playing with her or petting her say her name over and over. reward her when she gives you attention after saying her name, even if its just a glance at you. eventually she will learn it.    good luck! =]|`|KtpCSyGmaa	something that is close to u a lost relative or something it has on it like spot|`|1f555d8dbe7749c2511fc4233d54f028aa	If you use a 2 syllable name with sounds that are not typically found in other words dogs are supposed to be able to recognize them easier.

s6YmD7vaaa	I'm not sure if Heather plants are poisonous to dogs.  I'd call your vet if I were you!  I also suggest that you do NOT leave your puppy in the yard unattended.  Mini Schnauzers at that age are so small they could easily become a meal for wild animals & birds of prey.
qzPZf2XPaa	Yeah, I doubt that's going to hurt him.  Although it's true that chocolate has greater potential for harm in smaller breeds, such a minute amount could be copious.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Yes- dogs cannot tolerate a large amount.|`|66jX06Onaa	If it's just a little and he hasn't reacted yet, he'll probably be okay. Best to hide the chocolate from him in the future though!|`|b5WRitsZaa	yeah the dog should be fine...as long as it didnt consume a mass quantity of chocolate it will be ok|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	Yes but my pup ate a childs milk choc bar discarded on a carpet and she is a very small dog and she took ill later she was sick all day thankfully she got rid of it  choc is worse the darker (richer) it is and the smaller the dog and the amount consumed, i consulted a vet and  he said my dog wasnt poisoned. Chocolate contains theobromine. A naturally occurring stimulant found in the cocoa bean, theobromine increases urination and affects the central nervous system as well as heart muscle. While amounts vary by type of chocolate, it's the theobromine that is poisonous to dogs.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	Chocolate is very dangerous for dogs.  You want to monitor his  behavior to make sure he is not having adverse affects from the consumption.  He should be fine, since it was such a small quantity.|`|235185ccc037c43013533142501402eeaa	If it was just a small amount I would not worry to much. Watch for any adverse behaviors such as diarhea or real thirsty etc.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	If it was just a little taste, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just try to be more careful.|`|CelNp376aa	He should be fine just as long as he doesn't get any more for a while.|`|CYyNsTlGaa	He should by absolutely fine! I have a dog who ate a whole huge 80% cocao chocolate bar and they were fine, so you don't have to worry at all! If he did, as you say, just lick a little bit, it shouldn't harm him, but he might have a chance of a little diarrhea and he might get sick once, but I wouldn't worry about it.|`|Vz9PCeQwaa	depends on how much chocolate he ate. chocolate has a chemical called theobromine that can affect the dog digestive system but not the one of a human. Was it milk Chocolate or bakers chocolate? Bakers chocolate has 350 mg of chocolate and milk chocolate has 50 to 100 mg. Seeing as as though 150 mg is the lethal dosage you should check if your dog ate milk chocolate or bakers chocolate. take your dog to the vet just incase to be sure that hes ok.
gwUMipsUaa	What you should do is contact your local shelter or Animal Control officer so it can get the proper care it needs at the shelter.  They'll come get the dog.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	what is a sato?

They eat grains and seeds.|`|I3CNklLKaa	Black Forest Gateau.|`|UbNOv4a1aa	lamb chops|`|30sTzW9Naa	They should not be fed ANY type of meat, as they are herbivores. So make sure that when using your bucket to feed them in the morning make sure there is no trace of meat inside.    They can have anything else really; Left over human food should NOT be given to them. It is a  DEFRA policy that if te food has been cooked in any substance ie salt sugar pepper etc it should NOT be fed to any livestock.    Fruits can be fed to them, however sheep are prone to putting on weight very easily from such content, so try laying back on the fruits!    Veg can also be fed to them, however sugary veg such as carrots can also make them put on unwanted fat and weight.     I hope that helps :) ... have fun with your sheep :D|`|nY1nq9hCaa	I know what they can:    Grass, Hay, silage and haulage.    Bags of feed from animal stores: country mix, Lamb and Ewe for young lambs and mothers,  Tup/ram mix for young Boy sheep and breeding tup/ram the high copper content in the ewe and lamb mix can cause infertility and death in severe cases and solid beatpulp blocks    Turnip you see sheep put in turnip fields for winter.    Licks as well    Not to eat:  The weed ragwort a tall yellow flower, you can get fined for this if you have it in your field or garden with livestock.    Meat, chocolate pastry, bread etc    Anything that is not naturally available for them.
Qc0x3Ldaaa	When you are housebreaking a dog, allowing them to play outside is a big mistake.  Leash your dog, take her outside to potty, and while she is actually in the process of doing so, praise her enthusiastically!    Then bring her immediately back into the house, do not allow her to play outside.    After she is in the house for a couple of minutes, then let her back outside for play time, preferably taking her out through a different door.|`|AA12128656	yes. don't let her play outside.   crate train her. take her out for a potty walk. if she does go, THEN she gets to play. if she doesn't go, back into the crate she goes.  when you go outside for potty, have her on leash and be ALL BUSINESS. after she potties, then playtime is her reward.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	Housebreaking may sound painful but relax. It really isn't all that difficult. It is your dog's natural tendency to want to keep its living area clean so once the home is firmly established in your pets mind the problem will be resolved. There are several ways you can assist the process to move faster.    The first thing you want to do is be sure your pet is healthy to start with. If your pet has not been to the vet already, make an appointment. Your dog should be checked for overall healthiness and for conditions that would make house training difficult, such as cystitis and kidney or bladder dysfunction. While your pet is visiting the veterinarian, ask to have them checked for worms and parasites also by way of a fecal exam. Also bear in mind the truthfulness behind mothers' wisdom when she said "You are what you eat." A poor quality dog food, in addition to contributing to a poor nutritional state, can cause digestive problems resulting in loose stools, thus contributing to your pup's inability to control itself.    The most important part of housebreaking your pet is close supervision. This is necessary because your puppy learns by repetition. If you see your dog showing signs of needing to relieve itself, then immediate action must be taken to get the animal outside to its designated area. Consistency in training is critical. Do not think being lax because it's cold or dark outside is acceptable or your pet will adopt these same attitudes.    Close supervision during housebreaking is also necessary because it gives you time to learn your dogs special quirks such as needing to urinate right after eating or a certain action they take prior to soiling the floor so you can watch for these actions and respond in the future. Also it allows you to correct a situation while it is still fresh in the dogs mind. While being very intelligent creatures, short term memory is not the strong point for most animals of this species and correcting them after more than a few minutes have passed serves no real purpose.     Another key to Housebreaking is giving your dog a limited amount of space. Baby gates across doorways or a pet crate help to make a more confined area and help your pet to recognize this as his living space. Their natural tendency is to go outside of their own living space to urinate so making this association for your pet will make your job easier.    Lining this space with old news papers is a good idea at first as it facilitates a much easier cleanup of any accidents your pet might have. Also be aware that some surfaces are more pet-friendly than others. Try to confine your new pet to areas of the home with tile or vinyl floors which are much easier to clean. Avoid letting them have access to carpet or hardwood floors which retain odors and can be extensively damaged by an errant pup.    Remember to limit the amount of water your dog has access to at the end of the day as you will otherwise be making a walk with your pet in the middle of the night. A quick walk outside at regularly timed intervals is advisable to training as this helps your pet to set an internal schedule. Be certain to use a consistent keyword to tell your pet why you are out in the yard such as "potty" or "toilet" or anything you choose and do not return indoors until they have relieved themselves. Also remember to give praise when your dog relieves itself in appropriate places such as on newspapers or outdoors.    Again consistent training is the key. If your pet does have an accident indoors, correct the animal immediately and then clean the area using non-ammonia based products. Instead use an Enzyme based deodorizer to clean the area and be sure to remove all odor of the accident or the animal will repeat the behavior again.    If you follow these simple rules, your carpets and your new pet should be able to coexist peacefully and relatively free from stress.|`|WLNX00c3aa	it sounds like she's been trained to pee and then you'll open the door for her.  peeing by the door = going outside to play.    YOU MUST STOP that.  keep her on a schedule on when to go outside and do her business. correct her when you see her relieving herself in the home.  praise her when she does it correctly.      clean the area where she does her business in the home. put a bell or something that makes a noise that will let YOU KNOW that she has to go potty.|`|krI2fziJaa	Rub her nose in it and tell her no. If you must put her outside, confine her or chain her so she knows that it is a punishment. If you can, put her in the garage or another area for a "time out". She is getting to play after so she sees it as a good thing. You must associate it with a bad thing. Tkae her out periodically to go potty and whe she goes outside, praise her, give her treats and let her play. When she associates outside potty with something good, she will do it more.|`|qRD4sm3eaa	Don't let her play outside when she pees on the floor. If she pees inside, whisk her out for a minute or two on a leash. No playing. Just business. As soon as she goes potty bring her right back inside. If she doesn't do anything more bring her in anyway. If you want to play with her outside then that's fine but make sure its not after an accident.    Take her out every half hour to pee (out the same door every time). Praise her a lot and give her a treat when she goes potty. Positive reinforcement, simple as that. Also let her stay outside and play after she goes potty outside.    Don't expect her to be housetrained until she is 6 to 8 months old.|`|TZSMO5vjaa	Put the dog outside. Watch him to see if it goes potty. When it comes in give him a small treat, so its getting praised when it goes potty.  *Eventually he will understand
D1beU6MPaa	A few years ago I had laminate floors installed in my house because I thought it was just the thing because I had dogs who had accidents. WRONG! We always cleaned up right after an accident, and tried putting puppy pads down and everything. After a while the floor started buckling and discoloring. I had the floor company come out and look at it and they said it was because the moisture got between  the planks and got under the flooring. My floor was ruined and could not be repaired. All of the laminate flooring had to be replaced. Now, I have a nice vinyl type floor and have not had any problems. SO be careful with your floors. You may get a bigger problem than the one you have now. Good luck
ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	To prevent them from doing this:  http://www.grassmere-animal-hospital.com...|`|3giaPYe8aa	It is a breed standard that 40% of the tail remains, and 60% is docked.  A Pointer would not be able to "point" if the tail curved over the top of the back because of it's length and to prevent injury when working.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	It is necessary in working dogs to prevent traumatic tail injuries.  It is horrifically painful for an adult dog to injure their tail repeatedly until it is finally so badly damaged that it must be amputated.  In order to avoid this trauma, dogs of working breeds are traditionally docked at 2-5 days of age.  It's not comfortable for the pups, but it is FAR kinder and more humane than risking the kind of injury that is so common if the tail is left intact and considerably less painful than a tail amputation later in life.  Tails just don't heal well at all and in countries where docking has been banned the number of injuries to working dogs resulting in tail amputation has risen significantly since the ban of docking.  In dogs that are going to be just pets and are not going to be put through the same physical dangers as a working dog tail docking is usually not truly necessary but a breeder has no way of knowing which puppies are going to be great working dogs and which would be best suited to pet-only homes at less than a week of age so a responsible breeder will dock all of the puppies in a litter.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Unless you actually WORK your dog, it really isn't necessary - it's all part of how the dog SHOULD look as a breed. Most show dogs will have ears cropped and tails docked just because it's breed standard and the AKC hadn't yet made changes to the standard to allow natural ears/tails (though they have in some breeds.)    However at one point docking and cropping was needed to keep tails and ears from being cut up or tangled in the underbrush (or other similar instances) when the dog was working (hunting dogs, for instance.)|`|66jX06Onaa	It's a cosmetic thing.

uvU5DnHcaa	Degus are prone to diabetes due to their divergent insulin structure.  Degus are herbivores, feeding on grasses and browsing the leaves of shrubs, though they will also take seeds. Their feeding rate is constrained by the rate at which they can digest this relatively low quality food, and this varies between food types and environmental conditions, and like some other herbivores such as rabbits, they show coprophagy, chewing their own feces so as to extract more nutrition from them. This also serves to maintain healthy gut function during times when food is scarce.|`|HS44HUrgaa	yes you can. =]|`|VQM0ZpdKaa	yes for until you can get degu food they are rare pets so their food is hard to find|`|jyGTlpzTaa	No, degus are designed for a sparser diet that guinea pigs, guinea pig food will upset them.

3Wca5LY9aa	A Springer Spaniel would be perfect! I have a 3 year old Springer Spaniel and he spends most of his time wearing my daughter's dress-up clothes, lol. He is so sweet and gentle with the kids, I have a 5 year old and a 9 month old. Yet he runs around like a nut with my husband and they wrestle around like crazy. They are extremely loyal and protective dogs, I love the breed. I can go on and on about all the pros. There is just one con and it's a big one. They are terrible puppies. Until ours was about a year and a half old, we though we made the biggest mistake. He was rough, extremely hyper and crazy. He would jump all over us, run full speed right into us, dug holes constantly and would always get into the neighbors yard. I took him to a trainer for 6 weeks and it did nothing. It was rough. But I did some research about this at the time and read that the first year or 2 are tough, but then they mellow out. That's why you'll see there are quite a few rescue groups out there for them. We were very close to finding him a new home ourselves, but that would have been such a huge mistake. We were thinking about going with a rescue group next time around actually because of this. You may want to consider this option yourself, unless you are extremely patient and can wait until he/she gets through the puppy stage :) It's definately worth the wait in my opinion, just go into it prepared!    Feel free to email me with any questions or for pictures of our dog, Jax. Good luck!|`|n4pNNcGfaa	The person to ask is your breeder.  She should be your leading expert on the breed and besides she should know her own bloodline and puppies very well.    How well a springer, or any breed of dog, gets along with children and other pets is very largely dependent on how they are socialized while with the breeder.  The primary socialization period is just three to four months and at least half of that is in the breeder's hands.  So ask her what she is doing to prepare them to live with children and other pets.
V2FuF8Gaaa	I have an APBT, but I have many friends with the breed, they usually live to be about 13-15 years old, if you keep her happy and healthy, she will live longer :)
GTNnHgSPaa	They are all the same kind of rat, they just look different.  Dumbos DO NOT do well alone, no rat does.  They are not calmer.  A lot depends on the individual rat.

(I also have some very hyper dumbos. ;) )|`|xQtnTKCAaa	it may be hard for them because fancy rats grow bigger than the other breeds that you are interested in. so it may be more dominant and aggressive. i have a dumbo rat and he is perfectly happy alone. if you are getting them at a pet store and they weren't together there then you shouldn't put them together.|`|IFvj22PDaa	They will be fine all living together..

YES,  Brother and sister kittens can "do it" They are cats and do it instinctivly!|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	get her spayed this week|`|SoFeInwKaa	Well, who would she get pregnant with? She can't do it with her brother.|`|9dlRcS7caa	It's best to have her checked by a Veterinarian, though at her age, I think it is too early for her to get pregnant.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	It could be possible that she is pregnant. You might want to bring your cat to the vet to be sure.
dWW1ZiPKaa	My cat was around 7 or 8 months old when she got pregnant and she was tiny but she was fine. Cats stay pregnant for about 60 days or so. Take her to the vet and they can find out, and they can also give her rabbies shots and all that too. a few weeks before they are born (if shes pregnant) you can see and feel her tummy move (if she'll let you touch her) mine let me b/c Ive had her since she was a kitten and she trusts me, but I've seen some that are so mean and dont like you to touch them when they are pregnant. I separated mine from the boy cat a few days before she went into labor and I had a big box and I put old towels and blankets in there, and food and water outside of the box. Then I cut a small hole at the bottom of the box so she could get in and out. She had her babies in there. She will only have her babies where she feels it is safe. here are some links.. hope they help! Good luck! Email me if you have any more questions.     http://cat-care.suite101.com/article.cfm...      http://cats.about.com/cs/pregnancybirth/...|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	get her to the vet and have her spayed.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Take her to a Vet, she is very young, she needs tests for kitty diseases and her shots.  Both need to get fixed.|`|3Gs0FJ6haa	Thats a very young age for a cat to be pregnant in.  Is there any discharge coming from her?  Or, it might be a false carriage.  My cat used to have inflammation/discharge all the time, but she wasn't pregnant.  Just to be safe, I suggest you take her to the closest vet possible.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	The best way to determine what stage of pregnancy that she is in, is by calling the vets office and ask them to do an ultrasound. They will be able to tell you how far along she is.|`|vtpO7ppoaa	when my cat had kitten i didnt even know it she his in an old box with laundry in it she had the kittens and cleaned up evrything i didnt even see anything that would ahve suggested that she even had kittens she had 3 beautiful little ones
5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	well, being that I am assuming that you are a licensed registered breeder you should know all of this because those are the only people that should be breeding cats.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	She will do all the work.  I have posted a link on care for newborn kittens and the mother.  I would get kitten chow for the mother, so she has more calories.    When the kittens are about 3 - 4 weeks old, that is a good time to socialize them and get them used to being handled by people.  And when they are weaned, it is a good time to get the mother spayed.    It will not be dangerous for your baby, but use common sense in cleaning the litter box and the area around the kittens.|`|29ZL58Xjaa	I don't think that it would be dangerous for your baby, if you're talking about the cat that is going to give birth.  But if you're talking about your baby, as in a child, then you would want to make sure that the cat doesn't smother the child.|`|tMsMiapDaa	Since both babies and cats lack the level of awareness that adult humans do, it's possible that your cat may unintentionally injure your baby, or vice versa. To keep everyone safe, trim the cat's claws and don't leave your baby unattended with the cat.     There are common myths about cats smothering babies, but they are just that - myths. The mostly likely place you will run into issues is the baby grabbing at the cat and pulling whiskers, ears or tail, so as long as you supervise and teach your baby how to appropriately handle the cat as she gets older you should be fine.     Make sure you continue to give your cat attention after the baby is born. Major changes in the household, like the addition of a new person can be very stressful for a cat, and she may need some extra reassurance.     Babies and cats can easily live together in harmony with a bit of responsible parenting.
iXijnCxOaa	Sounds a lot like a urinary tract infection and *I* would get her to a vet ASAP-its simply not worth risking the pregnancy.  Please realize that YOU need to be very careful what antibiotic they give her as some will absolutely adversely affect the pregnancy... and if you take her in the the ER you should realize that many ER vets have issues with "breeders".    I'm sorry you're having to deal with this... good luck to your girl.|`|o93EwErKaa	I can see why you are concerned, especially since she is pregnant.  However, if she is aborting the puppies there is really nothing a vet can do.  Hopefully, it is just a common urinary tract infection.  As long as she is eating and acting normal otherwise, I think it can wait until tomorrow.     In the meantime, collect a urine sample for the vet.  First morning urine is best.  Here is a link on how to collect it.    http://www.ehow.com/how_2254624_collect-...|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	If she is otherwise fine (happy, eating, drinking) follow your vet's advice.    If she appears sick in any way, insist on seeing the vet.|`|AA10628838	I would take her to another vet since she is having problems urinating. I can't believe the other vet isn't more concerned about a urinary tact infection.|`|rO0LyKiUaa	Speak up to the vet!! If they don't listen SPEAK LOUDER!!!!    I don't know much about dogs but it sounds quite serious to me.|`|AA11097657	Don't worry too much as it sounds like a water infection and nothing to do with the uterus.    As long as she is not panting and seems distressed then I don't think it is anything to serious.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	l donot know if this is the first time you have mated your female or understand that a pregnant girl need careful watching and especiall for any infections which can occur through no fault of your own.Even if any of my females was doing this l would immediately suspect a urinary tract infection OR she was having problems with her prregnancy and despite being a vet nurse l over care my animals so l cannot understand how you could belive your vet would say it is nothing wrong or nothing to worry about with blood in its urine.Sometimes pregnant bitches may have a slligtht difcharge when pregnant that is true but you cannot take chances and l would go to another vet who is more caring of both your dog and you as to me this is a vet that is incompetent.l am sure you would be willihg to spend anything to get a correct diagnosis and get it over and done with so your mind is at peace and you know your pregnant female is OK.If you insist on using this vet then make an appointment and go in ASAP although personally l would not touch this vet with a ten foot pole.When a female is pregnant it is difficult if they do contract any infection as they cannot be given hardly any of the usual anti-niotics and other medication because of the pups.l will quickly telll you my terrible experience with a client we had.Her female was a medium sized pure-bred dog and top show animal and at around the ame gestation as yours is the female contracted some sort of infection which w e suspected at the surgery might have been a very mild case of kennel cough and despite being inoculated dogs can still contract this.Only one form of medication could be used as the pups would be aborted so she was given a simple anit-biotic and then when she had the puppies it turned out she had a massive infected uterus,15 puppies,nine live ones and only 5 survived despite the best efforts of the poor woman who fought like a tigress to save the live 9 which were severly underweight when born to the point that most people would have put them down.We saved that female's life but it was touch and go and it was only the good communication between her and the vets here plus her dilligence that saved the day.Those 5 pups turned out to be normal size by 8 weeks and a s healthy as could be BUT she always can ring us,come in when ever she wishes to and we help ,that is what a VET IS THERE FOR not to tell you that you are over reacting.of course you will get vets that just want you to come in and take money for nothing but in your case you are being careful and if it turns out to be nothing which l hope it does then your mind will be at rest.Get to a vet NOW or Emergency and take no chances or you may regret it later on. l do not mean to scare you  but have seen some awful and sad things happen at work and it is always best to consult your vet as YOU know your animal the best NOT the vet as they have thousands of patients and yes can look up a history but have never hear a vet say  to a client you are worrying for nothing that is negligent (Sorry to rave,we have a vet in my town that is like your vet and l cannot stand his layback l do not care attitude)EMERGENCY NOW!!!!!!!|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	maybe its a urinary track infection. the vet should put her on medication cause my dog had the exact same thing. good luck! And i think you should go to the vet asap!!|`|GaLw1qMwaa	i would call back and have your vet call you back asap or tell them you will find a new vet.    you need peace of mind. you prob talked to some office personal that had a bad day and doesnt really care about their job, therefore they dont care about you.    GOOD FOR YOU FOR BEING SO CONCERNED!    dogs need more owners like you.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	How about asking your breed mentor?  You do have one, right?  Take her to another vet and have her spayed and aborted.  Please do not be responsible for more unwanted dogs in this world.  It's not too late to abort!|`|AA11567932	I would take the advice, its something they have experienced before and all you can do is wait for labour to begin and keep calm.  It is scary for you but believe me you have nothing to worry over.    Its the most natural thing in the world and they can do it all by themselves|`|C1eHfhrHaa	If you feel like she needs to be seen then bring her to an emergency vet. Your vet won't mind, just make sure you call in the morning to cancel your other apopintment.|`|5765d15bf5b7da6026f760e75cea316faa	It will be ok to wait until tomorrow if it is an infection.  Sounds like one.  I wouldn't take her to an emergency vet because of the high cost but I might try calling other vets in the area to see if they have an opening for today if I did not want to wait til tomorrow to get her treated.  Hopefully the bleeding isn't pregnancy related and it is just a urinary tract infection.|`|BY0cV4kRaa	She may had a bladder or kidney infection, Get her to the vet ASAP.|`|4d24f2594ab7ee0417b9e0bb42231d64aa	You know your pet better than anyone.  It could be an infection.  If your dog seems to be uncomfortable then I would recommend finding a veterinary that will get you in right away.  In the end it's your choice.
IuYekkPVaa	From what you describe it sounds like he might have an upper respiratory infection.  He really needs to be seen by a vet for a diagnosis and so that he gets the proper treatment for his illness.    Hope he feels better soon.
m16gf9mzaa	Male cats, even neutered ones, can be much better daddies than their reputations say (yeah, some toms will kill kittens but not always).  I think that your male cat was trying to help the kitten.  My stepfather used to have a big old male cat, Tiger, who would clean the clock of any member of the household who hurt any other member, even if it was an accident. I remember accidentally stepping on our German Shepherd's paw, apologizing promptly to the dog, then having to apologize to the cat because he was ready to clobber me.  One time, my female cat was outside and got into a fight.  I opened the door to chase the other cat out of our yard, but before I even got out the door, Tiger shot out, beat the crap out of the other tom, and had chased it across the street.  Tiger then came and hovered around my cat for a while to make sure she was ok.    My male cat, Harvey, he has always taken kittens under his wing. He is convinced he is the handsomest boy cat ever, therefore all girl cats must be in love with him, therefore all kittens must be his (nevermind he got the old snip-snip when he was 5 months old, and none of those babies look a thing like him).  So when we have a kitten in the house, he happily bathes them, plays with them, lets them eat first.  And believe me, when I do something to make a kitten cry - like flea baths or claw clipping - he comes and gives me the old hairy eyeball. Generally that is ok, because it will be his turn for a bath or clipping next, anyway.      Your big guy was trying to look out for the little one.  You may also notice him playing kinda rough with her as she gets bigger.  If it looks like he is beating the crap out of her, watch closely - because chances are he is holding back so he does not actually hurt her, and will gradually show her new moves, so that she will one day be skilled enough to protect herself.|`|6e7991da1c49af3d2df013970572c123aa	Your male cat was only being protective.  My male cat did the same thing to me when my female was having kittens under a heavy dresser.  The kittens kept crying so I had to move the dresser and he attacked me too.  Then after we moved the kittens to the nesting bed he climbed right in and began to care for the kittens too.  Don't worry about it.  Pick up the kitten and pet her.  He'll get the hint.  And, while you're at it, pick him up too and let him know you're not mad at him.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	At seven months for your kitten, I hope your spay appointment beats her going into heat.  You really are cutting it very close.    I suspect something in cat language from the kitten got your older cat upset and defensive.  He heard something, but couldn't see where it was coming from.  Attacking under those circumstances is often known as displaced aggression, but protecting the kitten afterward is a new one for me.    See how things settle down.  I suspect things will calm down.
3sB49YNnaa	She could be pregnant but she might not be.  Guinea pigs ovulate on a 16 day cycle so, on time alone, you have about a 50/50 chance she didn't come into heat when they were together. Also, sometimes sows don't get bred on any particular cycle even if they have been mated.  In any case, time will tell and that is about the only way you will know.  If you get past 72 days from when they were last together, you are safe.  If she is bred, she will start to gain weight at 3 - 4 weeks and a few weeks later start to get sort of banjo shaped and finally 1-2 weeks before delivery you can feel the pups move.|`|uvU5DnHcaa	Well at this stage you will not know  for sure its way to early to tell. It also depends if she was in season the time that he was in there with her.   Gestation is from 69 to 72 days and average litter size is 1-4 .  10 weeks or 70 days is an average time which most deliver by.    Just write the date down that they were put together and then work out the date 70 days from that. If they she doesn't look very pregnant by the due date just add on 3 more weeks this give you the closest date that she can possibly be due by.    Hope this helps as its how I work out the dates for my sows.    All sows are different ! At 6 weeks there is no guessing if they are , its very obvious to the eye. There would be slight movements and a firmness all round. If there is only the one bub they are normally carried high up under the rib cage and are hard to feel for. She may not even look pregnant right up until she has it.|`|YsYq7BJzaa	probably it depends if its fat
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	even if one was free and the other was $300 they'd cost the same in the end with vet bills, food bills, accessories such as toys, kennels, collars, leashes, harnesses, replacement toys, backup replacement toys, food dishes, water dishes, emergency vet bills...    if you're talking in general... the puppy itself...     it depends on the breeder. I've seen Shih Tzu's for $500 and Yorkie's for $500.    I've seen a Yorkie for $450 and a Shih tzu for $550. I've seen a Shih Tzu for $900 and a Yorkie for $1500    your best bet is to go to a breed specific rescue (you can find one on petfinder.com) they are not as expensive as a breeder, they come vet checked, vaccinated and fixed... and you can find a dog of all ages.    but again, the price of the dog is just gravy. Its the rest you have to prepare for.|`|gwUMipsUaa	They cost the same at shelters and rescues.    http://petfinder.com/|`|o93EwErKaa	In general, a Yorkie will cost more, but it all depends on the quality.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	I think you mean Shih Tzu, not 'shitshu!'    Adopt from www.petfinder.com    If you adopt you would be saving a life, not to mention Money!|`|xTAR26Gkaa	Depends on where you purchase the dog from. Please avoid pet stores because they get a lot of their dogs from puppy mills and they end up having health problems. Look in shelters, by far the best deal. Or research online for breeders.|`|XagPxe7Faa	It depends on the breeder and what costs they have invested in their programs.  Prices will vary.|`|zQdYBoSpaa	I think that a Yorkie costs more. But, if your going to buy a puppy i would suggest getting a yorkie Because in my opinon they are alot cuter than shizus.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	I'm in the UK and, although I don't know prices of Yorkies from respectable show breeds, I'd say Shih Tzu were more expensive..  A well bred show Shih Tzu in the UK is likely to cost in the region of 650, BYBs offer theirs at 450-550 and bad Yorkie breeders are usually around 300-450.  It shouldn't be about price though, and you certainly need to do more research if you're wanting to buy one of these breeds as you have spelt Shih tzu wrong.  A well bred puppy (found by contacting a breed club who will give you contact details of responsible breeders) will cost less in terms of vet bills, you can search and search for the cheapest puppy but the cheaper you go the worse the 'breeder' and you increase your chances of having a sickly pup.|`|WPBnurY7aa	shitsu

vJ0NhNXcaa	Yes this is normal. I have a cat who absolutely loves human food of all kinds. I have even spotted her drinking my hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is okay for them so long as it is not real cocoa like the Hershey's Cocoa Powder. The stuff that comes in the packet like Swiss Miss isn't real cocoa. I think it's okay and normal that your cat likes different foods. Just be sure to limit his/her intake as to not overeat. I already have a fat cat! And its hard to get them to lose weight if they are lazy like one of mine is!|`|wxRPKEeYaa	Yes! That will mess up a cat's kidneys or liver! Cats don't like hot drinks, anyway. But please do not give him that. I am now worried about your cat.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Yes it is normal, chocolate is not too good for animals. Be careful.|`|76ac7cdd12842bb7648e869948fc1420aa	chocolate is not good for animals!! tea and squash are not a normal diet for a cat.  I wouldnt allow this if i were you.|`|WAHsITZhaa	Chocolate has something in it that can actually kill cats and dogs ( or any animal) if you give them too much of it. Don't feed your kitten any of the above. It's body needs just plain kitten food which has all the nutrients in it that it needs.|`|9dlRcS7caa	Hey, just like my cats, some wants to eat dalandan(Philippine orange) and banana, some wants to eat corn, some wants the bitter gourd leaves. I think they are just unique in taste..|`|1614d443b2a75a15762f316c8ead8debaa	Your cat is normal, just a little odd.  Tea and squash should be okay, but I wouldn't let him get accustomed to eating people food - after all, cats should eat cat food - it's formulated for their needs.  As for the hot chocolate, a little taste here and there is okay, but if you give them too much the cocoa will be toxic.  In dogs one square of bitter chocolate can kill an 11 pound dog in an hour, so be careful!
UPTu7uIVaa	I feed my cats Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul.  No dyes :)  It can't be found at stores like Petsmart, Walmart, Target.

a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	It does sound like ring worm and you can catch it from them or give it to them. Call around and explain your financial problems many vets will work with you so your cats get the care they need and you don't have to put out the entire amount for the bill at once. also places like pet smart sell stuff off the shelf you can use don't over bathe them that will make it worse. brushing them might help stimulate their natural fur oil and it might help also. If it is ring worm you need to treat their bedding and areas they like to lay|`|vwTyihvvaa	It could be ringworm, that makes them itchy. Or a change in diet, if you washed their bedding, etc.    Take your cats to the vet.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  This really sound like ring worm, and you can transmite to you too. Better call the vet before you have to go to the doctor yourself.  The local SPCA works with client with finance problem.

It could be anything from allergies to a parasite to some other skin condition. We can't diagnose your cats for you and if your cats are bleeding from all the irritation you should not delay seeking proper treatment.|`|MJactYa6aa	Sounds like fleas to me what type f flea treatment have you tried the best is Front line you put it on the back of the neck you can only get it from a vet or the internet|`|5vHbd8Xkaa	it stills sounds like an flea problem....when treating an flea problem...you also have to treat all areas where the pet lays...(IE...bedding areas, as well as your home)  if you have carpet that also should be treated...vacuum thoroughly...you should do this treatment every two weeks ...the pet also.The flea eggs may not be affected..so they hatch....producing more offspring...they in turn lay eggs..so the cycle continues.  To help the pets itching you may want to try over the counter products containing hydro cortisone.Look for the same for  bathing, or the spray type. Make sure you read the labels to see if it is used on felines..Hope this helps. Sevin dust is great for the carpet.  Sprinkle on the carpet let it sit for awhile(overnight) is better. Then vacuum as usual.

The male may kill the kittens to bring the female back into season. Or he will probably just mate with her as soon as her young are born.

CUFnorZyaa	Do they look like this?    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v299/b...    If so your snake is nearing the end of the shedding phase. In the next few days the eyes will clear up and look normal and shortly (2-3 days after that) it will shed.|`|9TQ91Xpoaa	Your Ball Python is alright, he is just going to shed soon.

You're really asking this?    You did this little research before getting a snake as a pet?    As has been said, it's about to shed. I urge you to do a decent amount of research to assure that you are keeping it properly so that you don't end up with a snake with major health issues. You've got an animal that depends on you for survival, and in all reality, it's your responsibility to do your best to make sure that it lives a decent life... and depending on what you have, you've got an animal that can live to be 20 years old or more. Are you ready?    Let me clarify... you weren't paying attention before the first shed. This happens to ALL snakes... EVERY time they shed... it's part of the process...|`|nmzpdvkqaa	hes just going to shed no need to worry|`|zBH33xb5aa	he's going to shed soon. make sure he has a water dish and some humidity in his tank and a rock or log he can rub against to help him shed. he probably won't shed for a few days or so yet, or eat until done.|`|u61yKsE3aa	A snakes eyes tend to "glaze over" and give a  blueish grey color right before they shed.  This is called the blue faze.  Ussually their eyes will return to normal and then they will shed shortly afterwards some snakes like my scrub python can take a week later to shed.  Most snakes will not eat during this period.  Also you will want to make sure there is plenty of humidity to aid in shedding you should have at least 50% humidity to help shed.|`|ufb32uRdaa	hi there  ur snake is shedding.u dont have to worry. but make sure there is proper humidity so thet it will get a easy shed. u can also get a shedding oil that u can rub on its skin to help him shed well.good luck
iKNQqtj0aa	Here is a long list of food:    Red or Green Bell Peppers: One slice of a whole pepper, given daily, remove seeds. Very high in vit c, especially the red. Pease note: Bell peppers are not to be confused with red hot chilli peppers which are a totally different food and should never be given to guinea pigs.  Broccoli: Half a floret, including the stalk, twice weekly.  Kale: Two to three small leaves, twice weekly. Not always available in our supermarket.  Carrot: One baby carrot or a small slice of a large carrot, every other day.  Romaine Lettuce: One large leaf, twice weekly. Never give guinea pigs iceberg lettuce, its not nutritious and it can give them an upset tummmy and diarrhoea. To be on the safe side, I give my piggies Romaine lettuce and none of the other varieties.  Celery: One 1/4 of a stick, weekly. Very stringy so needs to be chopped up into small pieces to avoid piggy choking.  Dandelion Leaves: Two or three, average size, twice weekly. A seasonal food during spring and summer.  Fresh Grass: Small handful, three to four times weekly. A seasonal food, spring, summer and autumn. Sometimes my piggies go outside to eat fresh grass for themselves on warm sunny days. Never put guinea pigs out on wet grass, always make sure the grass is dry and never use grass that's been cut by a lawn mower. When spring has arrived and your grass has started to grow, just give your piggies a small amount of grass to begin with so their tummies adjust. More about saftey tips below.  Baby Tomato's: One baby tomato or small plum tomato, twice weekly. Remember to remove the poisonous tomato top ( green part ). If using a slice from a larger tomato, remove seeds.  Cucumber: Very little nutritional value, but has high water content and is loved by most guinea pigs. One slice, include the outer layer which is their favourite part. Given every other day. Cucumber is really appreciated by guinea pigs in hot weather, it acts as a liquid and is nice and cool. A little like us enjoying an ice lolly.  Parsley: A few sprigs , twice weekly. Very high in calcium so should be limited if your guinea pig is prone to developing bladder stones.  Apple: One small slice, include peel, give weekly, remove core and pips. Royal gala variety is a favourite. Many fruits are full of natural sugar and have fruit acid. To avoid your guinea pig getting a sore mouth, cut all fruit into small pieces and just give as an occasional treat because of the high sugar content.  Pear: One small slice, include peel, give weekly, remove core and pips.  Seedless Grapes: One or two, must be seedless, give weekly.  Satsumer Pieces: One or two segments, remove rind and pips, give weekly. You can give a little of any orange citrus fruit.  Corn on the Cob: A recent new food. I'm unable to find corn on the cob with outer leaves, but the leaves can be eaten by guinea pigs. Roughly a dozen tiny segments, twice weekly.  Green Beans: Two or three green beans, twice weekly.
R3glUmwHaa	It depends, I don't think you should give him anything he can swallow or anything he can break apart and swallow.  I would recommend giving him a bigger bone to be on the safe side.|`|ZkWMXizZaa	what did you buy at petsmart the dog or the bone if you bought the bone at petsmart then i guess its ok but if the bone is a regular bone it should be ok but remember better safe than sorry so if you want to, go ahead and give the dog the bone (make sure he has teeth) ............ naturally the dogs like bones|`|fMU93DkIaa	Don't give a large dog a small bone.  Make sure it is big enough so that he won't swallow it.  Anytime he is chewing on a bone be sure to be by him and observe him in case he does start choking, or if he breaks off a small piece you should take it away.    Also, never give young puppies (regular) Rawhide bones.  Although they are (sorta) okay for adult dogs, they can block up puppies intestines and cause constipation and a visit to the vet.       After your puppy eats a bone you also shouldn't let him drink too much water right away(same reason as above). A little bit of water is okay of course. Then wait for a few minutes.       Just let your puppy have a little bit of bone, and then take it away.  That is safest.  Then you don't have to worry.    http://www.doglirious.com/rawhide-dog-bo...|`|2mbELVTOaa	I would wait until your puppy is at least 8 months old to give him a bone.Make sure that when you start giving your dog bones that you bye them from the store.We gave my dog a bone from our chicken and her face got swollen.store bought bones are the safest bones to give a dog expecially at that young age.You can also try giving your dog pig ears and meat bites.hope i helped.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	Only if you think he is ready|`|AA10405438	If it is rawhide and will not splinter.
l7Q5tCpbaa	VET! You may need to look into behavioural therapy for him. In effect you're reinforcing (rewarding) the pooping in the car by coming back and giving hugs.     Try a DAP spray in the car - it releases pheromones like their mum does 3-5 days after the pups are born. It'll have a calming effect.     Does he do this in the house or just the car?  DIY therapy would be to clean the seats/floor where he went, take him out for a longish walk so he's 'empty' before he gets in the car, leave him for say 30s, then come back and reward clean car. The a  min, then 2 slowly building up time.    The other option of course is not to leave him alone in the car! Either take someone with you or get gas before you take him out.     Third option would be to fit a harness or puppy carrier into your car, or put him in a crate in the back or back seat (check state laws - I'm in the UK so I've no idea if any of that is illegal in your state). In a harness or carrier he won't have as much space to do it, in a crate he won't do it. (You'll have to start with the crate in the house, leave the door open, put some toys in let him explore it. once he's happy going in and out, close the door for a minute or so and again, build up the length of time he's in there. )    Lhasa Apsos are another breed that suffer from people treating them like babies or teddy bears not dogs - that's why the suffer so much separation anxiety. Mine follows me around the house (he's in the doorway to the room munching on a pigs ear now!) but he also likes his own space and is quite happy to 'go lie down'.  He goes in huffs too - you have to ignore it until he comes back to you. NEVER reward a lhasa apso for nothing - anytime you give food or affection you have to make them do something first (nothing big - sit, give me kisses, give me a paw, something like that)     Don't entice him out of a huff by climbing into his bed, or tempting him to you with treats. He'll come back. I've taken to saying to mine "Are you in a huff? Oh well" and ignoring it - he comes back within 30mins (he usually stays in the room - sometimes goes to his 'den' under the stairs.)    Your vet will be able to confirm that there's no underlying physical reason, and help you confirm why he does it - separtation anxiety, dominance etc and recommend a reliable behaviouralist -   your insurance probably covers it.|`|eQaApazjaa	awhh i have a lhasa apso also and hes very attached to me too!! maybe they just are the type of breed that get attached?    i kinda like it tho..but my dog isnt THAT attached...ok well my suggestion for u is to get another dog. i have 2 other ones...ur dog just might be so attached bc hes lonley and ur the only person he has...u no??    if u get another dog then he wont feel so alone and eventually would be as attached
PVVsK9pWaa	Hi,  I think those collar are someone dangerous and inhumane to some extent and wouldn't use them.  My dog is a white German shepherd - mix and pulled very aggressively when I first got him last August. It really burned me up when I walked him. He weighs 50 lbs and was quite an effort to restrain.  A friend told me, that whenever he started to pull uncontrollably, just give the leash a jerk back and say "No".  It didn't work right away, and I was frustrated, but you know what? Before you know it, it was working.  You also need to let your dog know who's boss. I regret, he may not even be aware that his actions are undesirable.  Also, don't give him too much leash to run with - keep him relatively close.  Just be patient, don't get mad, but when he gets crazy - pulling you, give the leash (on a 'normal' dog collar) a hard yank.  Enough Yanking - and you won't have to be a Jerk,  Will In IL|`|0a77fc4ea3cd11663c40afe098d312f9aa	that's part of their breed to pull, unfortunately, and they are very strong dogs. Somehow you have to find a way to be "in control" and the "master" of your dog.|`|Tzijk13waa	I'm currently having this problem too. A friend of mine is vet and he took me out for a little training session. We got a gentle leader (it goes over the nose). This diminishes the pulling but it doesn't get rid of it. Every time my dog pulls, I stop dead in my tracks. I wait until there is slack in the leash before I continue. Granted, I stop every 1-5 steps, but she is improving. It's a really long process so I've decided that I will only do the stop dead in my tracks  for 20 minutes of my hair walk. Just wearing the gentle leader helps. Good luck! This is a really common problem so just exercise patience and stay consistent!|`|ddPkDxF3aa	Get a Halti.  With the halti you have control over the dog and because of the design he's unable to pull on the lead. http://www.companyofanimals.co.uk/halti.... check out this website to read more bout it.  Best of luck|`|xPxm8ONiaa	Take him to a behaviourist to fix his aggression problem. But for the walk, this is what i do.    1) When I leave the house, I make my dog sit, and I walk out the door, in front of him, and he can follow me. This establishes that your the leader.  2) He should always be behind you, or on your side. If he pulls, immediately jerk his leash to the side, and keep walking. Keep doing this every time he pulls. If he doesn't respond to the jerking of the leash, make him sit and stay, until he calms down, every time he pulls.  3) When you get home, walk into the door first, and let him follow you in.    (Use a normal collar. Put the collar at the highest point of his neck like they do in dog shows.)     http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...          The picture above is how the leash should be held on your dog.    This works for me, I hope it helps. :)|`|HkEAPJ6Waa	Patience and training.  Choke collars only do that: choke the dog.  You can actually end up damaging their throat.  I always recommend harnesses if possible.    For training:  Take a step - say "HEEL!"- stop and make the dog come back to your position and wait... then repeat.  You can start the training indoors until he starts responding if need be.  Show him who's boss by being firm and consistent... not mean.  Try to keep his attention on you by calling his name... get him to look at you.  You can start with food, but make sure he eventually responds ONLY to your voice... otherwise he might act up just to get a treat after you scold him and he obeys.  No joke... dogs are smart.  Oh, and don't just say "NO!"... always DIRECT him with commands.  Good luck!
RNNdRHrMaa	It's all about trust babe, I used to keep rats.   They are very socail creatures and need stimuli.  They are very willing to learn.    You can teach them tricks with bits of food as rewards. Foods they can eat and won't make them ill.    As for picking them up, firmly and confidently place your hand over their back and hold them. Not too hard.  You could teach them to come to you from the cage.    This is a good one to teach, you ust have to tell people NOT to put food through the cage, as they will they see your fingers and hand as food. ALWAYS open the cage doors to feed them and interact with them.    Be patient, and repetitve. The more you socialise with them and communicate with them, they will begin to trust you and will do more with you X   Good luck X|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	First check that any electrical items in the dining room are switched off at the wall and preferably unplugged. Open the door of the cage and pop it on the floor against the wall near where she is (or you think she is). Make a big fuss of filling the food bowl (she will recognise the sound of food being put out). Leave well alone for as long as you can bear to and have a cup of tea and chill.    Once you have calmed down and your rat has had a chance to become less spooked then you can finish tackling the problem. Quietly go back into the room and see if she has gone into the cage - rats are smart, and she may well have done this if food was left out. If she's not in the cage then sit down beside the cage, shuffle the food around and make eating noises (if you get yourself a real snack then even better). Act as chilled as possible. If you see her then ignore her if you can until she starts to approach you. If you scratch your nail on the carpet then they find this quite attractive. Rats are really nosey, and she will want to know what you are doing. You really need to be patient at this point as if you make a move too soon then she will be even more spooked and disappear. If you can, try to tempt her into the cage with treats, if not, then try to gently scoop her up, or if you really need to then use a small towel or tea towel to drop over her and then pick her up.     If you can't find your rat at all then you should leave the cage in the room with the door open overnight. In the morning your rat will most likely be curled up in bed in the morning.     To train a rat to come when called you should use a version of the 'sitting on the floor being chilled but interesting' trick. A rat really can't resist coming out to see what you are doing. When they approach then offer a training treat. Don't be tempted to pick them up or grab at them during the training process as this will put them off. I try if at all possible to only pick them up once they have jumped up onto my leg or come right under my hand.     Good luck with your ratty. I'm sure it will be fine. It's not like losing a hamster or a gerbil, you are dealing with an intelligent creature. If one of my ratties refused to go to bed on time I would just close the cage door and go out of the room for 10 minutes. When I came back then the missing rat would be sitting at the cage door asking to be let in. It helps if you always feed them just after their play time, as they will be keen to go back in to get their food.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	just pick her up, if she's not pregnant don't worry about hurting her. Don't be afraid to pick her up. Just grab her, bu don't squeeze.|`|AA11124885	Hold some food out to her and kind of make "smoochy" noises and she will learn to come to you when you make the noise.  That's what ours have done.  Really though, she'll come eventually.  Scoop her up with both hands, it's an easy way to pick them up.  Ours still squirm a lot when we pick them up but they love being held. Don't be scared of scooping her up, they all squirm.   Ours don't come when called, but will come when someone makes "smoochy" noises.  Try putting some good smelling food in a bag or box (just a little so she'll know it's there) like maybe a chip or carrot slice or bit of candy, then maybe when she goes to investigate you can pick it up.  She will most likely stay to the edges of the room, since they don't have very good eyesight and depend on feeling their way with their whiskers.  Good luck.|`|79b3d0f8c17037a2e4a5a3f573d4598faa	hi i have cple of female rats,mine r interested and come too me if they want too.rats r sociable animals.mine come out but not often.i have cats and dogs too.just u got too keep handling them then they get used too being wiv u.gud luck and enjoy!remember rats intelligent.and make great pets!|`|PUlQXDAyaa	calm down if it gets to desperate measure sort of trap her in a space and scoop her up in a box but try no to scare her or she will become spiteful xxxx hope this helps|`|J8T0UOyOaa	You do know rats cant fit throught VERY small places?

If shes a baby stick your whole hand over her (essentially squasshing her but gently) and then pick her up, if she is an adult and she isn't tame you will have slightly more difficulty picking her up. The best things to do is either get her trapped either under a box or in a live trap and then picking her up or if you can get to her pick her up by the base of the tail and putting her straight onto your arm.  Next time you buy a rat try and get one from a baby that has been handled from birth, usually breeders such as Kkpets.co.uk|`|rZVKjTV2aa	WTF?? Why did you let her out you furry fool. Put a box down and wait for her to run into it. Rats are idiots. Put food in the box and viola. Keep them in the cage for the bit!! Good luck xxxxxxxxxx|`|gTXUcd1maa	Well since she has only been with you for 3 weeks the calling her name isn't going to work. It takes a bit longer and  you have to give time and effort. Just support her belly and head. Or scoop her into your hands, and hold your hands in a bowl like shape. They also like it when you support their  back and hind and they are pressed against your chest, it makes them feel safe. Good luck!
uvU5DnHcaa	I've not had funny looking coats because of dehydration. Mice are very hardy animals, if they can smell water they will find a way to get to it.  I would be inclined to think that may be they have rex breed in them.   Photo's will soon tell us more and help solve the issue.|`|gTXUcd1maa	I think it's  just their fur growing in( though the pics would help) so, no worries. Yes, they are probably too small for their water drip feeder! You should just feed it in a bowl until their older. :] Good luck!
NzVwqpW5aa	Yes, both of our dogs did that, and one dog, once let outside, would roll herself in cow poop if we washed her in any shampoos that had a scent to them. The only way to stop her was to keep her in the house for about eight hours after her bath.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	He is trying to dry off, after I bathe my dogs I dry them off with an old towel, that is now theirs.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Yes! Absolutely normal. He is just trying to dry himself. My dog does the same thing. I think all dogs do it.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Seems to me he's trying to dry off.  Yes it is normal.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	He's trying to dry himself.  It's normal.  Don't bathe him too much and try drying him with a towel.  i use a blow dryer to speed up the process for my dog.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	This is very common.  And it's not as much about drying off as you might think.    After a bath, you've washed off the house-scent that the dog carries with him to make him feel like he's a part of his environment.  When your dog rubs himself into the carpet, he's trying to get the house-scent back onto his body.  Some dogs do the same thing after coming home from the vet's office, or coming home after a trip away from the house.|`|DXz6gIeuaa	Yes it's perfectly normal. All dogs that I've ever known do this after a bath and such. They do it just to wipe the water off, it's also a really exciting and fun thing for them to do. You can go from him doing this and turn it into a game. He'll have a blast.|`|TtIunPVeaa	after my poodle gets a bath she rubs on everything too, I think they're just trying to dry off or maybe it just feels good to them while there wet
zon13nY2aa	As an owner of 2 Pugs I don't want to give you a lecture but I urge you to do as much research as possible before deciding on a Pug. We rescued our 2 from a dog shelter and due to the previous owners neglect we are dealing with various health issues. In the month we have had them one has already been to the vets with a watering eye which turns out to be an ulcer. Due to their flat faces their eyes aren't protected as much as other breeds and extra care has to be taken when walking through long grass or near nettles.    If your parents are happy to occasionally foot the bill for vet treatment if these sorts of problems arise then that's fine.    Also, the previous owners of my 2 Pugs adopted the attitude that they didn't need exercise and they were taken to the shelter with luxating patellas (dodgy leg joints) and they were overweight. We have walked them for 30 minutes every day that we have had them and they look so much healthier and they seem to love walking. We take it slow and let them go at their own pace, and they never get out of breath or struggle.    If your Dad comes home at lunchtime that is perfect - as long as he is happy to let the puppy out into the garden until it has done it's business.    Then when you get home at 5 you can look after the pup for the evening. And on the week when your Mum gets home at 3 there is no problem at all.    This is a really good website on everything to do with Pugs. It gives some really good information and some of it is very useful - like the section on what to do in really hot weather.  http://www.pugvillage.com/pughealth_main...|`|6qsocyK3aa	As long as it's not too little (like, I would say, less than 6 months old), 4 hours should be fine, just no more.|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	It really depends on how committed you and your family are to caring for the dog. Is your dad prepared to spend 30 minutes of his lunch break walking and caring for the dog, or is he just going to stick it out in the yard while he eats his lunch? Are you going to get up 45 minutes early every morning to exercise the dog in all weathers, and then repeat the process when you get home at night? Now repeat this for 13 or 14 years without getting fed up or 'bored'. You should also factor in at least one training or socialisation session a week, at least for the first year.|`|yVUG0PKPaa	yes. My sister has a pug puppy and she keeps it in a crate. She is gone from 8 a.m. until 4p.m. mon-fri and the dog is fine. It has only had gone potty in the crate once and now he is fine. You just need to have a schedule and the puppy will adjust to it.
50WCN0graa	No one can really answer that question for you. You need to look on the back of her food bag to find out. The amount of food is based on the age and weight of your dog, as well as the brand of food you are giving her.    Often times the bag suggests a range for the food amount (ie: 1-2 cups per day). Personally, if I am trying a new food, I always start by giving my dog the smallest amount suggested. I do this because I don't want him to become overweight. If he seems hungry, than I increase his food intake. This helps me figure out "how much" within the suggested range my dog should eat. Also, remember, if you want to feed your dog twice a day, you will need to divide the amount by 2 for each meal.
F3rHMoFHaa	ask your vet if you can get a cone until your vet visit, that way your puppy will not be able to chew.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH THAT IS SOOOOOOO FUNNY TAKE HIM TO THE VET NOW!!!!!!!    =]|`|dRUgXlOLaa	You got your new pet almost a week ago. In that time, the little beast has eaten three pairs of shoes, four of your favorite Stephen King novels ( He left Cujo alone... Maybe he is a fan too? ), gnawed the trim around the bathroom doorway, chewed thru the power cord of your laptop and, just this morning, you found him gleefully chewing up your wallet with a side order of your credit cards. This is getting expensive really fast and starting to get dangerous for the pup also. Maybe it's time we intervened?    So how do we handle this situation? Once again, we want to be sure our young charge is healthy to begin, so off to the vets office if you haven't been recently. There is a medical condition that can cause chewing in pups aside from the normal tendencies they have of chewing to explore their world. This illness is called Pica and causes your pet to eat non-food items in an attempt to deal with nausea. So please visit your veterinarian and make sure your animal has a clean bill of health.    The next step involves understanding that, while chewing is a normal and healthy part of any pup's development, it has acceptable and unacceptable outlets. Puppies learn about their world thru chewing much the same as human children. They use their senses to explore the new world, which lies before them and their tactile sense, and sense of taste is brought into play as they chew on various objects. Much like human children, pups also need our protection from the dangers that lurk in their explorations. Electrical cords, needles, poisonous houseplants and household chemicals, even chocolate, all pose very real threats to your pet. It is your duty to protect the animal from these dangers.    Consistent training with the "NO" command can do this. No is a word your dog should learn early and respond to instantly. This one word has saved many dogs from many horrible fates. The pup is trained by repeatedly using the "NO" command every time a situation occurs. If you pet is caught chewing on your shoes, say "NO" in an affirmative tone and take the item from the animal. Do not let it become a game of tug-o-war. Rather, remove the item quickly or back up your "NO" with a spray from a water bottle, a loud clapping of the hands or a light but convincing tap on the nose. This little diversion is usually enough to make a dog lose interest in whatever they may have been chewing on. Also, do not give chase to an animal chewing on an undesirable selection of chew toy.    They will interpret this action to be a game and they will be most happy to play for hours on end. Instead, calmly work your way towards the animal and then remove the object. For items that are habitually mistreated, a chemical additive such as Bitter Apple may be in order to impart a foul taste to the item and make it unpalatable for the animal to chew on. Crate Training is also effective to stop chewing behavior and we shall discuss this course at length in later articles.    You do not want to completely destroy your dogs urge to chew however as this habit is healthy for them when exercised correctly. Instead, offer them suitable objects for their chewing pleasure. Perhaps a dog toy ( For quieter households, remove any squeakers from the toy. ) Rope toys and crunchy dog biscuits provide good outlets for a dog's destructive behavior and also help to keep up the oral hygiene of your pet.    Also be aware that all animals are different. Your dog may react differently than another dog in a given situation. Some dogs develop aggressive stances upon attempts to remove an object from their possession. If your dog becomes aggressive and territorial, then professional assistance is highly recommended to avoid further problems or biting.    With these simple suggestions, you can insure your pups' good health and the well being of your book collection. You might even find the time to spend some quality time reading Cujo again with your new best friend.|`|iPLg93Qmaa	Try and see if he has a rash, then all you can really do is wait for the vet visit :)|`|8v40KEd0aa	They are called Hot Spot's.

I wouldn't trust yahoo answers with this.|`|kzjclCaeaa	Dogs hate vinegar put it were he likes to chew and beat him.|`|7UYaoeFZaa	He may have fleas. Even in the winter they can take refuge in garages, sheds, and your home.|`|MYstdIMbaa	What type of dog do you own?  try to keep him occupied so his mind stays off the itch.  Get him to the vet ASAP|`|8UPrru3Taa	crabs|`|AWrR0vunaa	Def go to the vet. Remember puppies need things to chew on just like babies. They need attention and toys to chew on. I don't have much facts about ur puppy but claiming his private area is red and irritated he might be having a rash or a disturbance in his area. Maybe he has pain. The vet will know. Hell prob. need to get his area clean up and a special ointment to heal him up. Good luck.|`|yFmxQlrNaa	Check him for fleas.  He may also have dermatitis or allergies to your carpet shampoo or floor cleaners.  If he's old enough, give him a flea bath, if not comb him with a flea comb.  If you find no fleas, try some anti-itch or oatmeal based shampoo (check and see if he's old enough for this).  Keep the anti-itch stuff on for 5 minutes (don't let him lick it) and then rinse.  Also, you can put some tea tree oil on the red spots.  This will kill any bacteria or fungus and deter him from licking.  Good luck, Dab
YUQgyPT3aa	She is too young, and pet-quality dogs should not be bred because you think it would be cute to have little puppies around.    bad idea    EDIT: SHE'S STILL TOO YOUNG....WAIT UNTIL AGE 2 OR OLDER.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	Look on petfinder.com or craigslist.com|`|AA12128656	1 yr 3 mos is too young to breed.    get her a Ch and then you'll have the studs practically knocking you over.    what kennel club is she registered with?|`|dRUgXlOLaa	Visit http://friskypups.com to find a breeding mate in your area.|`|aCqSF87Raa	No responsible breeder would hand over a stud dog to you at this point in time.    For one, your dog is not yet two years old - which means she could still be maturing and she cannot have proper genetic/health screenings done to prevent the spread of genetic/health conditions.    For another, i'm guessing your dog is not a Ch., titled, or in any way proven to be a good example of her breed (determined by an impartial judge via showing.)    The only good place to find a stud dog is at the show ring - meet with the owner and talk about contracts. Otherwise you'll be getting a bunch of poorly bed dogs with questionable pedigrees and backgrounds.    PS - Be ready to spend over five grand on a HEALTHY litter of pups with NO problems during whelping. Be prepared to spend over seven grand if things DON'T go as planned (IE c-section.)|`|fgxajTiBaa	You will find a great mate if you call your vet and make an appointment for a spay. Do we REALLY need any more pet quality dogs being bred when so many are dying in shelters? Don't think there are any Maltese in shelters?    http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...    Just one of many! Do you really want to take homes from them?|`|RFfTjnxzaa	To begin with, she should not be mated until she's at least 2 years old.    Please breed responsibly. Have homes lined up for the pups or keep them yourself. Irresponsible breeding gives every owner of an intact dog a bad name.|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	I hate to be the first to say it, but don't add to the already horrendous dog over-population problem by becoming a back-yard-breeder. Over 2 million dogs are put to death every year in the USA because homes can't be found for them. If this doesn't put you off breeding some more then I don't know what will.|`|uNRygGS2aa	Before you actually let her breed, ask yourself... Why do I really want to breed my dog? Will I be able to support the puppies if I cannot find them a home? what about mom? Will you be able to support her if she needs some kind of emergency c section or something? If you are an experianced breeder, go ahead. Im imagining your not because you would already have a male to breed her with though. Did you know millions of dogs are put into shelters and euthenized every day? Just what we need, more puppies in the world that might not even get sold/adopted!  Btw, has she had her first heat cycle yet? You should NEVER breed her during her first heat cycle or before it, please please please wait until she is 2  years or older!!
