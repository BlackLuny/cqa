20090222144119AA9emTw	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Online high school classes/obtain college credit?	I'm a freshman at a public school.   But the classes at my school aren't so great. I can't switch schools though (live in the middle of nowhere).      So how and where can I take online classes (free preferably) and stay in my own school but still obtain college credits?   Foremost classes I'm looking for are French, Japanese, Journalism, and English classes (advanced english). Others also, but those are the main ones.      Thank you. (:

20090222144130AAZjxOa	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	How hard is AP History?	Okay, so a few days ago I got a list of honor classes I was invited to for next year, and on the paper I got a choice between Honors History and AP History. Next year I will be in 10th grade. A part of me wants to choose AP History over Honors, because one, college credits, and I'm very good at History (memorizing, just in History in general) but I'm afraid it will be far too hard and I'll greatly regret my choice.      How hard is it, honestly? Would it be something a fifteen/sixteen year old could handle? Should I even sign up for it, or just stick with honors? I just do not want to sign up for it and end up getting something like a C, or D, or even a F.

20090222144824AAta0wO	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Are people really getting stupider?	My guess would be yes with the idiots I have to deal with on a daily basis, but damn. My son is 10 and he is home schooled. I was looking for some more challenging material for him and picked up a copy of the state GED exam study guide and wow. I cannot believe that people who deal with the department of education are always bragging about the high standards they have set and gush over students who can ace all this utter crap they call curriculum (well, maybe I can). My son could easily complete this book without any problem. If he were in public school he would be in 4th grade I guess and if he were allowed, he could take the GED exam tomorrow and pass. For some stupid reason a person cannot take the test until they are 18 in my state. If a child knows the stuff why do they have to wait? My guess is because a younger person requires adult supervision if they aren't in school and this would take away from mom or dads slave, I mean work time. It is obvious to me that people are being made dumber with each generation, or maybe even with each passing school year. Any thoughts?

20090222104406AAQIDyP	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	College Chance Me Please!!! :)?	Hello. I'm currently a freshman at Hofstra University (a third tier school) pretty mediocre :/. I would love to transfer to Dartmouth College, Columbia University or Northwestern University...      UG GPA=  4.0    SAT score= 1840      I also attended Harvard Summer School and got 2 B+s.      In high school, I was freshman class secretary, sophomore class secretary and junior class president. I was also Key Club president my junior and senior year. I was treasurer of The Greenleaf Project, secretary of Feminists United, and general member of a lot of random other clubs.       I was a singer for the church band for 4 years and very involved with church, holding various positions on committees and such...      I founded a elementary school tutoring program where us high schoolers would go twice a week and read with the kids there..         I have 700+ community service hours... my grades in hs were either all As or really bad Ds and Fs.. I actually had a lot of family drama and moved out and lived on my own for my last semester of high school. So I still graduated at the top 20% of my class, but my GPA wasn't great... The months i lived on my own were pretty traumatic for me and I could write about it to explain the grade fluctuations... But I came out of it strong, independent, more compassionate, and learned to truly love and appreciate my family as well. It was a stupid decision that put me through alot of crap but I came out a completely changed person.. :]      Do you think I have a chance?! FYI my last semester in high school i got Straight As. And my first semester of college I got Straight As. So .. hopefully that shows promise? :) Chance me plz!!!

20090222111427AAPrEFP	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What should I do this summer for Yale?	would love to get into Yale; it's my dream college. I'm currently a freshman in high school.. Right now I'm taking all honors classes and Spanish a year ahead... I'm not doing as well as I would like, but I've got time to fix it I think. I'm planning on skipping Alg. 2 Honors next year and moving into Pre Calc Honors. My school uses a 5.0 scale, my GPA is currently 4.0, which I know is far too low, but I'm going to fix that this term and next. I'm not dropping any honors classes next year. I'm probably going to do track next year all three seasons. I'm an important member of my school newspaper, vying for an editor position. I do art, and I have "natural talent" at painting especially. Also next year, I'm planning on getting involved in my school's Model UN club. OH and English is my best subject...      So... thoughts, help?   I have no connections in Yale, also.      Oh, and even though I would love to go to Yale, I will apply other places and know that I might not get into Yale.       Soo thanks to all answerers! 10 pts to the best answer!      Also: this summer I'm planning on volunteering at my local hospital.      Is this enough???? Also what set you apart and allowed you to get into Yale?       Also, for those that have done JSA, I'm thinking of applying; is it worth it?      I'm really stressed right now. If you read above, you can see that there are probably 1000 students who do the same things as me... only better.      Soooo what can I do to stand out among the hundreds of thousands of hopefuls other than an essay? What can I do NOW?      I have no idea what to do during the summer as of right now--I'm in CTY, so I might take some JHU distance courses, maybe for credit. I know I need to do SOMETHING with my summer; I'm just not sure what yet.

20090222111012AAzkgK3	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Help??? I want become a doctor but i don't know where to go from here? Paramedic, LPN, or off to College?	Okay I am a senior in high school and someday i want to become an OB/GYN and do research in STDS. At my high school im currently in a Nursing Program, where at the conclusion i will have the opportunity to take the MBON to become a CNA/GNA. I also volunteer as a EMT-B at my local Fire Dept and am thinking about becoming a paramedic. I've been thinking lately about taking an LPN course before starting undergrad in order to gain more experience in the medical field and to also have the opportunity to  work under/ alongside a doctor. I'm planning on working at a research hospital or university hospital this summer as a cna in order to possibly get them to pay for my education or to just have some extra change in my pockets while in school. LPN school has been on my mind alot more because with this licenses i could do more work and become closer to physicians or alt least catch there attention. Im also looking for a LPN program that is in the summer or at the max. starts fall 2009 so that way im not to far behind in my Undergraduate year. I don't want to settle for a nurse, my ultimate goal is to become a physcian. My cousin told me that it would be a good idea to become a LPN so that when i start working as an LPN preferably in a University or Research hospital the doctors would be able to take me under their wings and guide me  through an externship or help me in some way to become a doctor and also pay for my schooling. This may also help me increase my chances of getting accepted into a institution possibly medical school such as Howard, John Hopkins, Drexel, etc. since i will be working for them. So my question is do you think this is a good idea, or just a waste of time and money. If you think this is a good idea do you have an idea of any cna to lpn classes or at least any summer or accelerated lpn classes. Also do you think i should further my education in the fire dept. I've also thought that if i do take the route of becoming a LPN that i could use my EMT certification to work as a Emergency Room Nurse, and with the money i earn i could save up and pay for school... I really don't know what to do with my certifications i have i guess i also need advice on what to do with them. I know this may sound appalling from someone as young as me but i want to become a doctor possibly in the least amount of time but with lots of experience and if the additional time is worth it i don't mind .... so far if i start off with undergrad and continue through to medical school with residency i will be in school for about ten years or a little bit more. OH and a little more about me i'm graduating this year C/O 2009 from HS, have a cumulative GPA of 3.702,  rank 17/ 384 have taken AP Chem, Bio, World History, Lit and Lang, and honor classes such as Pre-Cal, Anatomy/ Physiology,etc... IDK i need help what would you do if you were me

20090222112606AAT4XDC	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Music therapy or music education?	I am currently a senior in high school, and music is my absolute passion. I've been playing piano since age 4, have sung in choirs for 9 years, and am also on my second year of taking AP Music.       I know that music is what I want to do with my life, and have already been accepted into Duquesne University's music school as a music education major, and am waiting to hear back from Baldwin-Wallace College's Conservatory. Both Duquesne and Baldwin-Wallace have music education programs, as well as music therapy. For awhile, my plan has been to get my bachelor's degree in music education, but go on to get my master's (well, degree equivalency) in music therapy; I love both majors, but am really torn between the two.       Does my plan sound like a good idea, or should I choose one major and stick with it?       Also, if I get into Baldwin-Wallace, that's where I would go for music education, and I would then hope to go to Duquesne to get certified in music therapy; there are great opportunities in Pittsburgh with UPMC.

I'm in year 11 and at the end of this year i would get two grades in Science (Double) and i'm sure i would get A*s. I'm really confused coz my teacher asked me if i want to do Triple Science GCSE. so, at the end of year 11 i would get other 3 good grades in science. so it will add up to 5 GCSE grades for science. she said it will be good for university. I want to do medicine in university such as oxford. But doing triple science means i have to do other 3 separate exams with my other 7 subjects and also do a coursework. It also means much more hard work coz i have revise for this and there will be much more pressure on me with my other subjects. Do u think if i do the triple science, my hard work will be worth it?      Do u think i have to do Triple Science for doing medicine in oxford? getting an admission in oxford is much more competitive these days...      What do u think?????      Pl. Reply........      Thnx

20090222121040AANg5kS	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Is a petition a good idea?	Alright so here's the deal...      I was suspended from my High School for 10 days OSS, and I have a tribunal, which is like a school court to prove my innocence and if I can't, then I am expelled.      So here's what i did:   I downloaded a portable version of Firefox from my webserver and used it to connect to a proxy on my webserver to bypass the filters and go to Facebook. Some other students at the school also downloaded this from my server and connected to my proxy and were only given one day of ISS.      My thing is that I got charged with "Computer Tampering" when I believe I only misused which falls under the "Computer Misuse" category which only gives me 3 days of OSS and no tribunal. (Computer Tampering=Altering Hard-drives/Hacking --- Computer Misuse=Inappropriate use)      Because I am legally allowed to own a proxy and because I can't Control what others do and do not download onto their school accounts I believe i should be receiving the same punishment as the others who were caught.      I was considering going around to a couple Tech Specialists (ie. Geek Squad, Computer Tech Shop Specialists, etc.) and having them sign a petition if they agree that I would fall under "Computer Misuse". I have tried several times to set up a meeting with my principal, with many emails, calls, and even have had my parents visit the school, yet the principal has yet to respond to any of my attempts to explain myself. Do you think the petition is a good idea? Do you have anything I should add to it? Should I get local news to back me in this? Roughly how many people would i need to get for this to have any impact?      Thanks for any help!

What would you call this?       I know what it sounds like... XD But I’m not a burglar, nor do I have a wife.. I’m only 15 =p XD     Just wondering what phrase would be. Doesn't have to be a secret hiding something as bad as burglary, doesn't have to be bad really, but you know where I’m coming from.      Thanks =)      ~fryjak

But on the plus side i think i would really like it and I like how i can help people, it's only a 2 year course, and you make good money and since you make good money like 30/hour and you don't have to work full time and when i have children some day i can spend more time with them and work part time, and one more advantage you can start your own business and you dont ned very much materials to do so. But i don;t like having to live alone leave my boyfriend and family and friends.            My other choice is community college taking human services child and youth care worker, it's 2 years long i can live at home for my 1st year than id have to live 30mins away for my 2nd but its still close to home and not a huge deal. in total it will cost 1300.$ but that's including the cost of a place to stay and food for the 2nd year so it's a like 4 or 5 grand cheaper than the massage school, but i don't get as much flexability with this career choice and you migh make 16$ an hour in my area, if you can find a job in that field.      so i dont know what to do leave my fam and bf do something that is flexiable and rewarding    or    stay close to home be able to see my fam and bf and work a full time job but i have a chance that i wont be able to find a job in that area I study and i wont make goos wages.      what would you do??

20090222140109AAucGhS	Education & Reference;Homework Help	A child/teen's experience during the Great Depression!?	Hi! I have to write a narrative fictional essay of The Great Depression, however, I don't want to write about the Stock Market Crash, or the presidential election, I want to write about a teenagers experience of the time. I have chosen my main character to be a young teen, named Kate. I have done some research, but have not gotten a lot of results. I want to story to center around the hardships that she experiences.    This is what I learned from my research:       -Black tuesday      -Roaring twenties      -"flappers"      -apple stands on the street corners      -men leaving home in search of jobs      -hobos/Hoovervilles      -bread lines/soup kitchens      I want part of it to be her comparing her present life to her former priveleged life, but I still need some research, and I am completely clueless as to what the events throughout the story will be, because it can't just be her sulking about being poor. So if you have any ideas as to what the events throughout this story should be, please answer! Also, if you happen to have lived through that time, please share your experience as a child or teen!    Thank you for your time!

20090222142901AAShZa2	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Any suggestions on this paper?	we are supposed to compare and contrast our book from Macbeth. I'm reading The Hound of the Baskervilles and the main character is Sherlock Holmes. We have to see which author writes a more interesting and relevant complex character, with quotes from each book. Are there any mistakes i may have over looked or simple things to improve it?   (this is an 8th grade paper so its not supposed to be spectacular and this is only the body paragraphs, no intro or conclusion added yet.)              ___The author Arthur Conan Doyle writes more interesting complex characters than Shakespeare. On page 14 of The Hound of the Baskervilles, Sherlock Holmes, one of the complex characters in the novel, states this line, “Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible.” In this particular part of the book Sherlock and his friend Watson are trying to figure out whose cane was left in their office. This quote is interesting because it shows the thought process of Sherlock and what he thinks is different from how most readers would think. This sentence is interesting and also shows the complexity of Sherlock Holmes.    ___On the other hand, Shakespeare doesn’t do as great a job at creating interesting and complex characters. On page 73 of Macbeth, the main character, Macbeth, has just killed the king in order to become king himself and this is what he says, “I won’t go back! I’m afraid to think of what I’ve done. I daren’t look at it again.” Although this quote shows that Macbeth is complex because his emotions change to regret, it is in no way interesting. Most people would say similar things if they hah done what Macbeth had. The quote does not cause the reader to think very much or intrigue them, making it uninteresting.    ___Arthur Conan Doyle also does a better job at creating relevant and complex characters than Shakespeare does. In the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles, on page 17, Sherlock Holmes becomes impatient with his guest and states this line, “ I think you would do wisely of without ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.” This line shows Sherlock clearly being impatient and it is obvious with his choice of words. This shows that he is complex because he has different emotions, but it is also relevant to the readers because most can relate if they were in a similar situation. For example if a person is frustrated or impatient they would show it, just like Sherlock Holmes did.   ___Conversely, Shakespeare doesn’t create relevant and complex characters as well as Doyle can. In Macbeth on page 75, Macbeth is once again showing regret for killing King Duncan and states this, “Wake up Duncan with your knocking! I wish you could.” This show that Macbeth is showing regret again, but no readers can relate to this statement at all. None of the readers would have killed a king. This makes the quote irrelevant to most of the readers reading this novel

I want to major in accounting, and there are 5 accounting accredited schools in California (2 public, 3 private):    - Santa Clara University    - University of Southern California    - San Diego University    - San Diego State    - California State University: Fullerton      I want to get out of the bay area, so Santa Clara University is out of the question, but out of the remaining 4, which should I choose? Should I go to a public school or a private school? I heard that in the accounting field, it doesn't matter what college you go to just as long as it's accounting accredited, you can get your CPA, and you have a lot of experience.       If I had the money, of course I would choose USC, but if the name/rank of a school doesn't matter that much, I would very well rather save money.      Is paying $150k extra to go to a private school that important? Will going to a private school rather than a public school really help me that much in the long run?       Also, I was thinking of going to let's say Fullerton for two years, then transferring to USC. (USC accepts transfers as a half-freshman, sophomore, and junior.)

My friend...or acquaintance... has applied to all of the colleges that I have applied to. And so far, she has gotten accepted to 3. And I have only gotten a letter from 1... one of the most easiest colleges to get into in California.       I am getting really anxious to see whether or not I have gotten into the same ones she has. And if I don't, I am going to be very upset.       The worst part about it is, she always posts bulletins on myspace, tells everyone she knows, but never me directly, and always talks about her grade point average and how good she does in school. I am getting annoyed, and now at this point, worried about my status on the colleges.       I am not "far behind" her academically, meaning I am only like 5 points below her gpa.

20090222142644AA32jMo	Education & Reference;Homework Help	ONLY IF YOU'VE READ THE GIVER! English assn. is to write Ch. 24 for the giver. Tell me what you think!! :)?	Despite the cold wind and snow, the joy of reaching Elsewhere warmed Jonas, giving him strength to walk down the snow-covered hill closer to the brightly lit dwellings. The closer the pair got to the dwellings, the warmer they became. Jonas automatically knew that the warmth he was feeling was the same warmth he felt in the memory of love. This time, however, Jonas was creating his own memory of love, a memory that he would be able to keep forever. As Jonas was creating his own memories, the memories that he received from the Giver were slowly drifting away from him. He knew that the memories were traveling back to his Community and entering the minds of all the people he loved: Mother, Father, Lily, Asher, and Fiona. He hoped that the Giver would be able to help the Community understand the memories and they would learn to live with the memories.     Finally, Jonas had reached one of the dwellings. It was gaily decorated with different colored lights and inside the home, there was a tree surrounded by different sized boxes. Jonas held Gabriel up to the window to show him the beautiful scene.     “This is what it was like before Sameness, Gabe”, Jonas whispered in the baby’s ear. “Isn’t it beautiful?”    Gabe looked at Jonas and smiled. Jonas smiled back and Gabe began to giggle. Gabe’s giggles became louder and Jonas feared that someone would hear them. Jonas’ fear was confirmed when a man came out of one of the dwellings and walked towards Jonas.     The man looked at Jonas curiously and asked, “I don’t believe I have seen you around this Village before. What is your name, boy?”    “My name is Jonas, and this is Gabriel. “ Jonas replied nervously.    “Well, what are you doing out so late? It’s Christmas Eve, you know.” The man said. “You should be inside your dwelling with your family, waiting for St. Nicholas to come.”    Jonas told him, “I don’t have a dwelling. I am from a distant Community and Gabriel and I have just reached here. We traveled a long distance to reach Elsewhere. What do you call this place?”    “This is the Village.” The man responded. “If you’d like, you and Gabriel are welcome to stay in my dwelling. I live with my wife and my daughter, who is about your age.”    Jonas smiled and said, “Thank you so much!”   Jonas, Gabriel, and the man walked back to the dwelling. Inside the home, Jonas was very surprised to see a fireplace.    “In my old Community, we never had fireplaces.” Jonas told the man. “The Chief Elders said they were dangerous.”   “Really?” The man said. “All the dwellings in the Village have a fireplace. It gets very cold here in the winter.”   “I guess my Community and your Village are a little different.” Jonas said. “Thank you again for inviting into your dwelling, sir.”   “Call me Robert”, the man said. “You and Gabe can sleep on the couch tonight. Tomorrow is Christmas. We will get to open presents and in the evening we will all go to the town hall and have a Christmas dinner.”   “It sounds wonderful!” Jonas exclaimed. “Thank you again, Robert. Good night.”   The man smiled and said, “Good night, Jonas. Good night, Gabriel.”   Before Jonas drifted to sleep, he thought about his journey to the Village and whether the Community had found out about his escape. He thought about Christmas morning and the Christmas dinner. He thought about the Giver and his family. Most importantly, he thought about Gabriel and new beginnings.

20090222143629AAhrXWO	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I work towards becoming a PTA or PT?	I could become a physical therapist assistant in about 3 years or I could become a physical therapist in about 6 or 7 years. I know I'd make more money as a PT, of course, but I'd like to begin working (and start a family) as soon as possible which makes the PTA option more appealing. Becoming a PTA would also leave me with less debt.      The transition to PT wouldn't be any easier/shorter if I were already a PTA so I'm not sure which direction I should head.      Thanks a lot for any advice!
