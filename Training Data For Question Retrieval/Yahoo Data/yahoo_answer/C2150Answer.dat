V0uzsE6kaa	AH HA!  I've figured it out!  I can sleep now, yay!  Ok, so I had to kind of trick yahoo messenger out of the infinite request loop.  Here's what you do:    Go to www.meebo.com  Enter your username/password in the yahoo section.  It will log you on and give you a friend request.  Accept.  Log out and log back in using the messenger.    When you log back in with yahoo messenger it shouldn't prompt you to add yourself.  You will have to re-add all of your friends, but it should work fine from here on out.

I don't always get the amount of answer that I hope for every time i ask a question either, sometimes I have to write out my whole thought in the "details" box, then I have to specifically pull out the question that i want answered the most, but I still leave it in the details.     for example on this question I would word it "How do I get more people to answer my questions"    and for some of your other questions I would put "How can I get ripped" or "How can I get definition in my muscles"

So it may take a day or two for your picture to show up on Answers   ----------------------------------------...|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You CAN use a picture of yourself, or another picture. To do so, you have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!|`|5Ra5xbziaa	you can use a different picture|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	If you want a photo/custom picture as your avatar you need to make a yahoo 360 account. http://360.yahoo.com/login.html?.done=ht...

de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	After you've reached certain points, your Level on Y!A will be upgraded automatically. And once your Level has been upgraded, you can do more things. Like in Level 1, you can only ask 5 questions, answer 20 questions and vote 20 undecided questions per day. However, once you reached Level 2, you can ask 10 questions, answer 40 questions and vote 40 undecided questions per day, plus, you can also start rating other people's answers by giving them thumb-ups or thumb-downs.    And as for gaining points, well in Yahoo! Answers, basically you just need to keep answering questions and your level will be upgraded automatically.    And here are the ways that about how you can get more points or get your points deducted:    1. When you answered a question, you got 2 points.    2. When you vote for the best answer, you will get 1 point and if you have chosen the question with no best answer, you will not get any point and the question will be deleted by the system automatically (it needs to depend on the percentage of how many Y!A users have voted/ chosen No Best Answer for the question).    3. After you asked a question, 5 points will be deducted. And if you have chosen a Best Answer for your question, you will get 3 points back. And if your question has been voted as No Best Answer, then you will get back 5 points and your question will be deleted automatically.    4. After your answer has been chosen as Best Answer, you will get 10 points as a reward. And if that Best Answer has got Thumb-ups, each Thumb-up will give you 1 point.    5. Log in Yahoo! Answers every day will give you 1 point but it has to be 24 hours after your previous log in.    6. And finally if your answer has got deleted, then 2 points will be taken away from you and you will get the violation e-mail from the system.    More info about Points & Levels, here's the link:  http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...    Hope these help.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	the points are only an account of your usage and reliability of your answers.  When you receive a certain amount of points you go up in levels. they do not do anything after you reach level 7.      -5points for asking a question  +1point for voting  +10 points for Best Answers  +1 point for each thumbs up you receive before your answer is chosen as best.  -10 for a Violation  +3 for choosing a best answer

If they accept emails or IM, send them a message to let them know that you intended their answer for the Best Answer.  If, by chance, it happens again, you can mention the mistake in the ratings comment box.   Crap happens.

During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.    Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You need a total of 250 points to get to Level 2.   You have a total of 115 points, you need another 135 points to get there.    You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	250 points are required for level two.|`|AA10263208	250    But you get 2 points for answering questions (which you have earned points doing already) and then you lose 5 points for asking questions (and you've asked 3). You're going to have to do a lot more answering than asking. You DO start off with 100 points.    Oh, and if your answer is chosen as Best Answer, you get 10 points!    :-D|`|Qswzc6w7aa	250points to get to level two    You loose 5 points everytime you ask a question|`|AA11252878	A score of at least 250 points is needed to reach Level 2. Here's the scoring chart to look at:  Level 1: 1-249 points  Level 2: 250-999 points  Level 3: 1,000-2,499 points  Level 4: 2,500-4,999 points  Level 5: 5,000-9,999 points  Level 6: 10,000-24,999 points  Level 7: 25,000+ points    Since you're still in Level 1, use your daily allotment of the following:  1. Answering 20 questions for 2 points; and,  2. Casting 20 votes for the Best Answer to an unresolved question for 1 point each.    Here are other ways you can earn points to get you into Level 2 even faster:  1. Logging into Y!A daily: 1 point  2. Getting your answer chosen as the best one by the asker or the Answers community (the latter in Voting): 10 points  3. Receiving a "thumbs-up" for your Best Answer: 1 point (up to a maximum of 50 points)  4. Choosing the Best Answer to your submitted question: 3 points.    How not to lose points:  1. Asking a question: -5 points (limit the number of questions that you can ask until attaining higher levels; you can ask unlimited questions once reaching Level 5 that starts off at 5,000 points)  2. Incurring a violation in a question: -10 points  3. Incurring a violation in an answer: -12 points  4. Filing a false violation appeal: -10 points (in addition to the last two items)  5. Self-deleting your answer: -2 points.    Hope this helps.
AA11252878	Here are the ways not to get your Answers account suspended:  1. Read the Community Guidelines and do this often-these rules can be modified or changed without any notice to you.  2. Post content that fits within the confines of the aforementioned rules.  3. Act responsibly toward your fellow users.  4.

suPD7c3gaa	First you learn to spell it, so you can effectively use Google to look it up.  It's "bankruptcy", the root word being "bankrupt". I'm not being critical.  You need to be able to effectively do all the research you can, because if this is a step you're considering, you'll need to be as prepared as possible before hiring a bankruptcy lawyer. Believe it or not, it's costly to file Bankruptcy.  This was not a good category to choose to put your question in.  There are a lot of variables to filing for bankruptcy.  It would be almost impossible, even for an expert, to give you all the information you need in an answer on this site.  You need to do some serious research, and talk to a professional.    Here's a very good site.  But there are many, many more you can check out with a Google search.    This is an excellent site that answers a lot of common questions:  http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/question...    That site even allows for you to "ask a bankruptcy lawyer" right there on the site if you can't find answers all your questions.    Here's a Google page:  http://www.google.com/search?client=safa...|`|BIwZ7klfaa	contact a Financial Attorney|`|I9NNRW8Aaa	File Chapter 13 Look below|`|0ghQcy7Vaa	See to it that there is no other solution that you can do to avoid filing for bankruptcy.   It's highly recommended that you hire a lawyer.   Research your options as it relates to filing.  Obtain some consumer credit counseling.    Find out how much it will cost.  Consider the two common bankruptcy types. There's Chapter 7 (a straight or liquidation bankruptcy) or  Chapter 13 (which is a repayment plan for individuals).  Meet with your lawyer.  Your lawyer should then be asking and answering all of your questions.

BUT I do like answering questions and I guess they could input one of those boxes that make you "Type what you see" to prove that you aren't a spambot so people could continue to answer questions.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	The limits have been in place since the site started. They are not about to change that. They want people to start slowly, so they can learn the site properly and not immediately violate themselves into a suspension.     As you gain in points and levels, your limits rise. At Level 5, you go unlimited. Even without Best Answers, you can get to Level 5 easily within 1 month. Faster with Best Answers.

AA11408911	Hello Kelli    Are you asking how to make a clickable link within Yahoo! Answers ?     In order to make a link a user simply need to post the full web address of the website including the http:// prefix. Therefore www.yahoo.com becomes http://www.yahoo.com    For longer web addresses, you might want to consider copying and pasting the url into your question. This can be done by right-hand clicking in the address bar and selecting copy, then right-hand clicking in the question construction box and selecting paste.    [ Thanks for the update ]    Your more than welcome, glad I was able to help - and relax, we all have to ask questions when we are unsure, it's how we learn.     All the best  Chrs|`|xU7AaQOdaa	I have to hand it to "cheers", cut and paste is the way ahead!

H5zZrXoCaa	It really depends on what you're using as your email provider.  If it's something like hotmail, aol, or yahoo, you can't use Windows Mail.  If it's gmail or an email for your own website, those support POP email, so you'll be able to get mail with Windows Mail with those.<br>  <br>  Check with your provider, they'll tell you what it is.  It's usually something like pop.provider.com for incoming and smtp.provider.com for outgoing and both requiring authentication (your username and password for the account).

If you want a cartoon figure then go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and create or modify one and then go to part 3.  2? If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions. Mark the one you want to use as primary.  3? Now for either a cartoon or a picture save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers.

Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.c om/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Fl...

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	I just checked yelp, wasn't familiar with it before. Apparently they accept jpg files for avatar pics, and since this is so, yes, you should be able to use your Yahoo avatar. The reason why: Yahoo uses the latest flash software to create avatars, but the outcome is always a jpg. All you have to do is rightclick your avatar to open it, then rightclick it again and from the dropdown menu choose the location on your harddrive where you want to save your pic.

(JPEG files usually end with ".jpeg" or ".jpg" or ".jpe."). Also its size must be smaller than 5MB.?????    ?Now, Sign in your Yahoo! 360 page     http://360.yahoo.com/    ??? If it is your first visit to your Yahoo! 360 page, Click "Get Started" then do steps needed to start your page (like:click "Next"....etc).    ?Click "My Page" on the bar to the top of the page    ?Click "Edit Personal Photos" to the left of your page    ???OR CLICK ??"Add a Photo" if you you did not add any photos to your Yahoo! 360 page before.    ?Click "Choose File" to browse your picture, then click "Save" at the bottom of the page to UPLOAD it.    ?Click "Set As Primary" and SAVE.    ??? You do not need to click "Set As Primary" if you uploaded only one photo, in this case, neglect this step as the photo you uploaded will automatically be set as primary.    ?Now go to your Yahoo! Answers profile and click "Edit my Info"    ?On "Picture" options, choose ? "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture"    ?Click "Preview" at the bottom of the page then "OK" at the bottom of the next page.    ?Thus you're done, though, it may take up to 24 hours to find your picture showing here on your profile, Qs and As.

IdlaZQ8Jaa	Y!A has this thing called trusted reporter.  I'm not sure how it works but there are people out there trying to achieve an advanced reporter status for the very reason you mention.--They want questions to be deleted as soon as they report them.      For the most part it takes 2+ users to report a question in order for it to be deleted.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Alot of users have to report the same question mate before it will be removed they won,t remove it if only one user reports it.
AA11252878	It may depend on the number of serious offenses of the Community Guidelines that warrants the permanent suspension of the user's Answers account. This includes, but not limited to:  1. Insulting other users (and all other form of rudeness)  2. Spamming  3. Adult language  4. Bigoted slurs  5. Violating the Q&A format in any way (including ranting)  6. Cheating (i.e. placeholding and point-gaming)  7. Mentioning and advocating criminal activity  8. Encouraging and glorifying the harming of themselves, other people, and animals  9. Impersonation  10. Underage users    Also just one Terms of Service violation will result in the immediate and outright termination of their Y! ID-that's without any warning whatsoever. This include some of the above infractions of the CG.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	You either have been reported many times,used bad words in answers and questions,or violated the Community Guidelines.    GOOD BEHAVIOR ON YA  1,Share what you know.Chances are, someone could benefit from your knowledge, opinions, or personal experiences. Sharing what you know is one of many ways you can make a positive contribution to the community    2.Be courteous.Remember, we're a diverse community of people with diverse opinions. Everyone wants to be treated with respect, and showing respect to others makes the community better for all members    3.Be a good citizen.When you see a great question or answer, give it a star or thumbs-up. If you see abuse, report it. We're committed to doing our best to stop abuse on Answers, and, with your help, we can make a difference    4.Cite your sources.We encourage members to use online resources in answering questions. Just be sure to cite your sources and give credit where it is due    5.Ask clearly.Keep your questions succinct, but be descriptive enough to help people understand what you're asking. Correct spelling and grammar help people find your questions, and you'll get better answers when others can clearly make out what you're asking.      BAD BEHAVIOR ON YA    1.Venting, ranting or using hate speechYahoo! Answers isn't a soapbox to vent personal frustrations or rant about issues. We are a community of people with diverse beliefs, opinions, and backgrounds, so please be respectful and keep hateful and incendiary comments off Yahoo! Answers.    2.Chatting or otherwise violating the question-and-answer format.Yahoo! Answers is a community of questions and answers, not a chat room. If a post is neither a question nor an answer, it doesnt belong here. If youre looking for a place to chat with others, try Yahoo! Groups or Yahoo! Messenger Chat Rooms.    3.Being mean or obsceneBecause kids as young as 13 may participate in Yahoo! Answers, sexually explicit and vulgar language and images are not welcome on the site. Also not welcome are belligerence, insults, slurs and generally objectionable speech. If you wouldn't say it in public, don't post it on Answers    4.Exploiting the communityYahoo! Answers is a place to gain knowledge, not customers, page views, or dates. If you have years of experience in something, have a special hobby, own your own business, or if you are a knowledge partner, it's OK to accompany a good, on-topic answer with a link to your website, blog, or email to offer more information. However, it is not OK to post links that are unrelated to the topic or are clearly meant only to solicit others for personal and financial gain. Also prohibited are solicitations like "Will you add me as a contact?" or propositioning people    5.Cheating Our points system is meant to reward the community members for sharing questions and answers, so creating multiple accounts or posting content for the sole purpose of gaining points or soliciting others for points is not permitted. Posting filler answers to a question in an effort to be first to answer, or copying and pasting other members' answers, are also forms of cheating.    6.Violating the lawMembers of Yahoo! Answers are not above the law, so don't post anything that violates the laws of your country, state, province, or city. Don't try to trick people into sharing their personal information, steal anything (like copyright or trademark material), or break into places you shouldn't be. Don't threaten, harass, impersonate, or hurt others, and don't invade other people's privacy.    7.Behaving maliciouslyDon't post links to sites that contain viruses or malicious programs or that interfere with the operation of Yahoo! Answers    8.Misusing AnswersDon't create multiple accounts to troll or otherwise violate these guidelines or the Yahoo! Terms of Service. Don't post things that are incomprehensible or in the wrong language, and don't post the same question over and over again. The community depends on you to report abuse and rate questions and answers, so using product features such as report abuse and ratings to target others is not allowed.     9.Doing harmBe responsible and dont misrepresent yourself, claim false credentials or expertise or give advice in a way that might cause someone harm. Dont incite or advocate violence or harmful practices.
AA11252878	It indicates to you the person didn't like the way you answered their question and blocked you from viewing it as a result. That's how you got that message when clicking on their question.|`|de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	It means the asker of the question has blocked you.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	It means the person whose question that is has blocked you.|`|tDaU7eYXaa	Yes, when "person a" blocks "person b", "person b" cannot see their question. This is to prevent "person b" from putting an inappropriate answer. For example, I once saw this person who was suicidal and stated on all of her answers, "I wanna kill myself, my dog, and kid and smear our blood on the walls." And she always copied her violent answers onto other questions. This disturbed me. Therefore, I blocked her to prevent her from putting a violent, disturbing, and unnecessary answer to my question.

IdlaZQ8Jaa	troll can be a number of things.     one type of troll is a user that posts leading questions to get a rise out of people. they post questions for no other reason than simply to make other people angry. I find a lot of them in "Gender Studies" "politics" and "religion and spirituality"    Another type of troll is someone that will specifically target a certain user by reporting all of their questions and answers as violations. no matter what. These types of trolls are everywhere and you will know if you are being attacked if you start receiving a list of violation letters from random and often older questions.    people that have more than one account that they use to ask the same question over and over, or for point gaming, or for attacking people with violation notices are also trolls.    those are the main three categories of trolls that I've come across, maybe some one else knows of others.|`|lqbAA0Ytaa	As defined by Y!A:    A "troll" is someone who intentionally and persistently posts inflammatory messages about sensitive topics to bait users into responding or provoke a confrontation.

C6jFigESaa	Hey plumdumplings.    Sadly, I am afraid to say the answers you have received so far are in error.  But I hope they all learn from this answer.     When you report a content and it is not removed immediately,  CC ( Customer Care) will review your report nevertheless to check whether your report is accurate or not at a later time, such as in 12 to 48 hours.  And if your report is in error, you will certainly lose a little influence.     Since you said you accidentally reported someone, I highly advise you to have the Staff informed of this issue by contacting them at: y_answrs_team@yahoo.com ( the missing E in answErs is deliberate).     When contacting the Staff, please include the URL to the content you accidentally reported so the Staff can investigate it and avoid lowering your trust level.    Once again, if you report a content which did not remove immediately, CC will eventually review your report.    Take care, and I ask kindly that you be careful next time.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	It's not really that big of a deal.  many people get reported every day with actual violations and nothing happens to them.

6qsTmMQaaa	Post your questions at night, and in better known categories. For example, if you're question is about cars, don't put the question in the Car Make >>> Acura section; instead, put it in the General - Cars & Transportation (or Other) section. That way, you'll get more answers. Whatever you do, try not to post it in Polls & Surveys, because you could get reported for placing the question in the wrong category. I hope I've helped. Good luck! =)|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	Put the question in a section that is filled with people for example if I ask Why are there trolls here that report innocent people?

OAKuDqXXaa	A) You ask dumb questions.  "I am so exhausted after 7 hours of constant snowboarding." DUH.    B) If someone has already posted an answer, then other people are not going to answer if they have nothing new to add to what the previous person said.  People aren't going to waste their time writing a response that is identical to the one above.    C) Questions that get numerous posts are ones that are more opinionated and open ended.    D) People look at only the recent questions, and only answer ones that they find interesting.  I usually go with whatever looks interesting on the homepage and occasionally focus in on the chemistry subject area.    E) People are turned off by poor grammar, English, and spelling.  I am not going to waste my time trying to interpret poorly worded questions, or ones that look like "word vomit."  For example, the following are points in this question that I find repulsive: "doesnt," "questins," "Ive," "but I always soo  people," "gotton," "anwers."

Next Rate the answer between 1-5 stars by judging the answer how well it was written!! Leave a Thanking comment and Click Submit. You can redeem 3 points by selecting a Best Answer    3) Remember to pick a Best answer within the given time or else it goes into voting where the Community has to choose the best answer to your question for you, since you have failed to do so.

Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.

C6jFigESaa	Hey ghost_warrur.      Please note I have completely changed my answer in order to properly answer your  question, since you weren't clear at the beginning.  Thanks, though, for the additional details.     Unfortunately, your comment did not answer the question being asked, and thus was in violation of the Question and Answer Format.     The Q/A Format says:     "We ask that community members follow the question-and-answer format because Yahoo! Answers is a question-and-answer community. This means when you post a question, it must be written in the form of a question. When you post an answer, it must attempt to answer the question being asked."    Since you never answered the question being asked but rather commented on someone's else answer, you ended up violating the Q/A Format.    Sorry about the bad news, but at least you learn, and rest assured the learning process never ends for anyone.     In my source box I have provided the Q/A Format link for you so you may avoid this error in the near future..    Take care|`|7HEZhx46aa	Sometimes it's not really a violation - it's just someone who doesn't LIKE the answer for some vague reason, and they report you.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	Bid the highest that you're willing to pay.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	Use auctionsniper.  It is easy.  You put in the maximum that you want to pay and it will bid at the last few seconds for you.  Don't bid on the item before then.  You will only make the price go up.  You don't always win, but it is the best way to go.    http://auctionsniper.com/adpage.aspx  Just check it out.  The first few that you win are free, but they will charge a little after that.  It has been worth it to me.  I got a $400 camera for $185.  I would love it if you would use me for a reference if you sign up.  Email me for details:)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	bid the absolute highest you would pay for the item, if you get outbid tell yourself they overpaid!|`|W0ltl4ulaa	Auto bid to your max that you want to pay if you dont win move on and find it elsewhere. Yes there are those sorts of people everywhere.|`|60UGQvMSaa	Wait until 10 seconds until the auction closes, then go higher! GENIUS!
Tu9S1WaNaa	I think that Ebay wants all sellers to be paypal verified.  It will show up to buyers if you aren't, and it may scare them off.    I would check on ebay.  To be sure ask it on their Q/A board.   http://answercenter.ebay.com/search.jspa...|`|29fa5460a9c16006e5e07e22271195c2aa	Yes you can sell without being verified. It doesnt matter if you are verified or not. I have seen verified sellers scam people. Getting verified basically just means they have your account information.|`|m5J36D28aa	It should work fine, then you will have more in your paypal acct.

a4b0e58e7fc3d933670b14375b88b2cdaa	Your problem could be in part to one or more issues. It's hard to diagnose the problem with such vague information. Is this an issue that you have offline as well or is it only when you're online? Is the issue just when you're on this particular site (or online game) or other sites as well? Please update your response so that we can better diagnose the issue.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	Did your seller provide you with a tracking number?    If not, ask them.|`|m5J36D28aa	Ebay shipments happen in days, not weeks.  Ask the seller when you will receive it.  In the future, check the auction and ask the seller what shipping he will use if it isn't specified.  When the auction says "standard shipping", that's just a label the seller puts on there, it doesn't describe whether he is using UPS, Fedex, or USPS.  He has your money, you have a right to know when & which shipping method he is going to use.      I sold a camera on ebay last Sunday.  My auction said I would ship by Fedex Ground the next day.  I shipped it last Monday and the buyer received it and left me positive feedback this morning Wednesday.  There is no reason for ebay transactions to last any longer.  Unless of course if the seller uses UPS Ground which can be more than a week and cost more than USPS and Fedex Ground.|`|29fa5460a9c16006e5e07e22271195c2aa	Be sure you keep all communication with the seller that you have in case you have to open a dispute. I hope you checked the sellers feedback rating. I would again contact the seller and tell them if you do not have it by Feb. 1 you are opening a dispute. Then open it. Now, when you paid if you paid for shipping then you can file a dispute now because there is no shipping that takes that long.|`|WjZ9tXI0aa	If the seller states it will be there early February (and it doesn't turn up) then raise a dispute. You might be expecting a bit much to have it before they stated it would be there. Factors such as what postage, date the payment went through (If not on paypal) and seller's access to postal come into effect.

You compose the message, write the email address of the destination email, click on attach file, browse your hard drive, select the file, click on it then open.  After doing it it will upload the photo (as long as it isnt over the 10 MB limit) and once it does, you can successfully send the email.  What part of the process is not working correctly?
