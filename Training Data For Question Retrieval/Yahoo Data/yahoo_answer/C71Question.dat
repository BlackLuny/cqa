20090307110818AA8lChc	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Have Americans forgotten rights?	Our Forefathers understood very well that for every right there is a corresponding duty.  It was such a rudimentary concept in the philosophical writings that they followed, that of course they never bothered to put it into the major papers that they wrote (the only ones it seems, that people ever read today).   Have all Americans forgotten this now?        If you have a right for freedom of religion, then you have a duty not to violate it for someone else.  As far as concepts go, this seems to me to be one of the easiest things to understand ever.  But nobody seems to know it.        If I hear one more lowlife chant, “I have my rights, I have my rights,” I’m going to flip out. “No you piece of **** you stole from someone else, so you no longer have your right.”      And Christians, do none of you understand that if you go around imposing your religion on someone else, then you no longer have the right to religious freedom? (I’m Christian BTW just so people don’t get caught up on this part and only comment that I’m a godless heathen completely missing the point of the entire conversation)      Does anybody understand what we should be teaching Kindergarten students?

20090307113456AAsXyUp	Politics & Government;Military	Army or Marine Corps?	I am in highschool right now and have sort of a dilemma. I know that I want a career in the military but I do not know which path to take. I really want to go into the Marine Corps, but after some thinking I thought maybe I should go thru ROTC, kill two birds with one stone College and Commissioning, rather than enlisting in the USMC and going to college later. I then found that the college that I want to go to only offers AROTC. I then thought about doing USMC PLC but I do not know if taking PLC I would receive any sort of Tuition Assistance, and that is something I would really like to take advantage of be it the GI Bill or just ROTC tuition Assistance. In my head it is still an option for me to enlist and then go to college but I'm leaning towards the whole college thing. I would like for someone who is going thru AROTC or USMC PLC or even just an Active Duty Marine to answer my question, but all answers are welcome. Thank You!!

Had I known about that I would have gone that route, so i signed over custody to their dad (whom i was legally seperated to at the time),who told me he was just caring for them while i was away at boot camp and ait. well i been in 5 yrs now and he wont give them back like he said, talking to a lawyer is my next step!! After reading alll the different answers on here I'm beginning to think that maybe i won't be getting my kids back because i'm still in the army. Since DoD policy is that you can't give up your kids to join the military and thats exactly what my recruiter had me do(because my first order was a TEMPORARY custody order) which he made me throw away because that was just it, it was a temporary one and it mentioned the fact that they were only going to be in someone else's care while i was away at training, he told me it couldn't mention anything about me joining the army. I know I was lied to  now I and my kids want to be together so bad, what can I do?? Can I contact my congress man?? My plans are to hire a lawyer to fight their father to get them back. Any legit advise would be appreciated. ...oh yes and I did think things though before joining and talked to my kids and family about it, I just thought i was going to make their life and mine better seems like all i did while defending this country and being strong I messed up the family I once had!!

If anyone has studied logical fallacies, you might recognize some of the following logical fallacies used by Bobby Jindal last night.         Fallacy 1.) Appeal to Fear: creating fear in people to constitute evidence for a claim.   Fallacy 2.) Misleading Vividness: Making future predictions on dramatic events that don't coincide with statistics      Jindal's use of Appeal to Fear and Misleading Vividness:    "..some bureaucrat showed up and told them they couldn't go out on the water unless they had proof of insurance and registration...Harry just told the boaters to ignore the bureaucrats and go start rescuing people. There is a lesson in this experience: The strength of America is not found in our government."    (As if to imply that supporting the stimulus plan will inhibit emergency aid for disaster victims)   -------------------------------      Fallacy 3.) Factual Error      Jindal's use of Factual Error:    "That is why Republicans put forward plans to create jobs by lowering income tax rates for working families...But Democratic leaders in Congress -- they rejected this approach."    (FACT: The stimulus plan includes tax cuts for 95% of working families:  http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/economy...  )   --------------------------------      Fallacy 4.) Straw Man Argument: Sensationalizing or exaggerating someones views to make them seem more refutable      Jindal's use of the Straw Man Argument: "Democratic leaders say their legislation will grow the economy.Who among us would ask our children for a loan, so we could spend money we do not have, on things we do not need? That is precisely what the Democrats in Congress just did. It's irresponsible."    (The stimulus bill was passed to hemorrhage runaway unemployment. This is an exaggerated view of the Democratic agenda.)   -------------------------------------      Fallacy 5.) Factual Error      Jindal's use of Factual Error (again) :"What we oppose is universal government-run health care. Health care decisions should be made by doctors and patients, not by government bureaucrats."   (FACT: "Under the Obama-Biden plan, patients will be able to make health care decisions with their doctors, instead of being blocked by insurance company bureaucrats." --  http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/health_...  )      There were also some examples of Red Herring and Ad Hominem in his speech.

20090227083909AAoyhc5	Politics & Government;Politics	If the economy was so strong under Bush's leadership, why were so few jobs created and so much debt incurred?	Only a net 407,000 private sector jobs were created during the 8 years of the Bush presidency, a paltry sum of approx. 51,000 per year and the lowest since the Great Depression.        Yet the lions share of the Bush tax cuts went to those who were supposed to use the money to create jobs.      Also during the Bush Presidency, the govt. ran up more debt than anytime in US history and now Bush is on the hook for signing spending bills that nearly doubled the national debt to it's current $10 trillion dollars.      So where does the illusion originate by Bush supporters and neocons that Bush was a good steward of taxpayer dollars and the economy?
20090225072511AAM3VP7	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is Obama allowing Gitmo to be opened again?	... my guess is that he saw that he was getting a lot of bad ratings for it, and just like a celebrity he only cares about the ratings. not to mention the fact that all the hypocrites in Europe wouldn't shut up about Gitmo but when we wanted them to hold some people for a while they refused.       then the investigation looked into Gitmo recently ans wouldn't you know it, everything fit the Geneva Convention! looks like Liberals have to find something else to ***** about.
20090225074538AA0hOZS	Politics & Government;Politics	Is Bobby Jindal naive to think he can be the Republican nominee for president in 2012?	I'm an Indian, so I feel I'm more than qualified to comment about him.      1. He's running as a Republican as a minority, a dark-skinned Indian person. I think he only won in Louisiana because of the color of his skin. I'm not sure, but I don't think he'd win as a Republican anywhere else. People were fooled. He's kidding himself if he thinks the average Republican will vote him in as a nominee. They'll probably label him a terrorist somehow before then. I get so many people asking me if I'm an Arab already, what are they going to do to him?      2. What's up with the corny Southern accent? Does he think this will improve his chances of impressing Republicans? Does he just want to be accepted by these people because of some issues from school?      3. I know all politicians are dirtbags that crave power, but come on, he should know he has a better chance with the Democratic Party. He probably has more in common with Obama than he thinks. Indians aren't dumb people. He's just setting himself up to be a lifelong joke this way.      Ladies and gentleman, I give you Bobby Jindal, the Alan Keyes of the 21st century.

Is it time to let these companies fold and let natural market forces clean up the mess?

20090225053557AADB7ZT	Politics & Government;Politics	How is Bobby Jindal so amazing?................?	How do republicans think Bobby Jindal is so great when he is only denying something like 10% of the money being given to him.  The only thing he is against is expansion of unemployment benefits.      His comment about Obama saying "We May Never Recover From This" was obviouslytaken out of context.  What Obama ACTUALLY said was "If we delay and don't act fast we may never recover from this." Saying if we screw around we may not, Jindal made it out to sound like Obama flat out said we may not recover even with this bill.  Which he NEVER said.       He Also Contradicts himself here:   To solve our current problems, Washington must lead. But the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of Washington politicians. The way to lead is by empowering you -- the American people. Because we believe that Americans can do anything.         He says Washington must lead us to solve our problems and then says that the way to lead is by empowering you.  Fairly evident that both are not possible.            http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washingt...

20090227083743AASdOMl	Politics & Government;Elections	What is wrong with this statement about Reagan et all?	I know all about Ronald Reagan. He gave to the rich and starved the poor. A fabricator and a brilliant ACTOR... Hope you get my drift. As I pointed out in my post he was the only president that did manage to decrease the deficit. However, he didn't pull us out of anything. Reagan approved the largest tax increase in United States history the next year and another massive tax increase the year after that. Reagan left office with a record deficit and a still staggering economy in 8 years. President Reagan was also shown to have increased the public debt even more than the despised Jimmy Carter..but guess what? Carter inherited a recession from...GASP!... a republican(NIXON)! At the end of his second year, Reagan’s approval rating was 41 percent; after the Iran-Contra scandal was revealed, Reagan’s approval rating stood at 46 percent. His approval rating for his entire presidency was lower than Kennedy’s, Eisenhower’s and even Johnson’s, and at the time he was one of the most unpopular presidents ever. Now Dubya has taken his place. We still haven't recovered from 'trickle down' economics and 'Reaganomics'. Reagan had the biggest deficit in history up until now.

20090227091528AAg9Y0R	Politics & Government;Government	Do you believe Government and some businesses purposely post numbers to call back that are dead end numbers?	They've already got your money.  Or by virtue of their being a government organization that you HAVE to go through to do something, they know you need them but the workers there don't particularly want you because you are just extra work for them that they would rather avoid.  "Hey!  We're just punching a time clock and this is government work.  Who cares (or who is going to dare to fire me as long as I get by with the minimum)?"      So have you ever had this experience...You try to get in touch because you have an important issue to resolve.  Maybe you are calling for after-sales service...or you need to ask a question about your application or the status of your case.  And when you call the number you've been given, one of the following happens:      a)  The number is ALWAYS busy, no matter what time of day or day of the week you call...      b)  You never get a live person.  You always get sent to a voice recording system and even though you leave one or more messages, they never get returned;...or      c) You get the infuriating labyrinth of "Press 1 for English; Press 2 for Spanish" (then the same message in Espanol).  Then it's "Press 1 to pay your bill; Press 2 to order new service; Press 3 to check on the status of your order....[etc.]"...and then if they even GIVE an option to speak with a live person (and many systems now don't), the option is ALWAYS at the end because they are signaling to you that they DON'T want to spend money on a live person to give you real service.  And then when you press to speak to a live person, you wait on hold for a period of time, only to be played another recording, "We're sorry.  We are experiencing unusual call volume.  Please try your call again later.  Goodbye!"      ARRRRGGGGHHH!!!!      My theory is that these companies and government entities truly skimp where-ever they can and have resorted to technology as a slick way to replace human beings (all in the name of "progress", right?).  They do it to save money because when it comes down to it, they don't really CARE about giving you quality or even responsible service.  And when it comes to the government, who do they even have to report to in terms of meeting minimum standards of customer care?  There is only one government, so they have no competition.  And no competition = Formula for largess and bad responsiveness.      So what I am asking is whether you believe -- or have actual proof -- that these entities give lousy phone service ON PURPOSE and direct you to dead end numbers because when it comes right down to it, they JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU...or is it all just one big "misconception" ?

He was charged with a felony but it was just a pipe with residue of cocaine.  Why wasn't he just charged with paraphenalia?

He also was charged with obstruction because he tried to reach for something twice on his bed (he did NOT have any weapons) after being told to remain still.  He was subsequently thrown to the ground and suffered a concussion. His prior record was a DUI one year ago and check forgery 13 years ago and that's it.  He also isn't from Georgia and was travelling.  He lives in New York.  What kind of time could he be facing?  Could he possibly just be ordered to do some sort of drug treatment program, community service, and work with probation in his own state?  THANKS for any help.  He is basically a decent guy and he's been clean for a long time but just relapsed.  We are still good friends and I'm worried for him.

According to a source,    The United States alone has contributed more than $1 trillion (in current dollars) in foreign assistance since World War II. Yet in 1996 the United Nations reported that 70 countries, US aid recipients all, were poorer than they were in 1980; 43 were worse off than they were in 1970.  (Perhaps – move this to argument section)      If they are worse off now, should we really have ever started giving foreign aid? The money was initially given to create allies around the UK that would help against the Soviet Union, but now it seems to be a social trend.      Could you please give your opinion in a courteous manner as I understand this is a sensitive topic. Also, site your references if you can.   Thank you

Another driver hit me, and made a statement to my insurance company that doesn't match other evidence or my statement. My insurance company denied his claim. However, his insurance company also denied my claim since they are obligated to believe his statement. Because I don't have collision and comprehensive, by insurance company can't go to court for me. So I have to take the other company to court. If I can use his statement in court, I've got a great case. But can I legally get this statement? If not, he could just plead the fifth, or change his story, and his logical inconsistency will be no more. I've asked my insurance company, but they don't know since they usually either take people to court themselves, or people don't try to use statements in court.
20090227090540AAOb3kd	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	School is stonewalling. Should I get an attorney?	Last week my 7year old who was on the school grounds was picked up from behind by her neck and body slammed to the ground and then kicked by a boy who witnesses ( her 8 year old sister & one classmate) said looked to be in 6th,7th,or 8th grade. She or her sister have no clue who the boy was and have not had a problem with any kids in the school. When I found out about it no more than two minutes after it happened I immediately went to the Vice Principal and asked him to call the police because my child had been the victim of an assault & battery. He refused and told me to go home and call the police because if he did "they would take forever to come." I called the police at home and was told that the V.P had to call because it happened on school grounds. I went back to the school on the same day and both the V.P and I called the police the but never came. The next day when I called the police to make a report I was told that the police didn't come because I called during shift change. I have filed a complaint with the police review board but still have not heard back from them. I called the school district (who I had already e-mail two complaints to about the school's lack of security) and they set up a meeting with the V.P and my children and I. At the meeting the police were called so that I could finally have a report. When the officer asked the V.P why he had not called because according to the district rules he was supposed to he told the police the same thing he told me "you guys take forever to come." My children went to every upper grade classroom to find the attacker but was unable to. They saw a boy with the same hairstyle and clothes and started to shake and cry.  I asked the V.P for a transfer because my 7 year is terrified that she and her sister will be attacked again I was told no because it was "close to testing and they were good scorers". When I asked the district if I could transfer my child out of their current  school that was three blocks away and in our attendance boundaries to a school that four blocks away but was not in our attendances boundaries  I was told no because the only way they could be moved is under the NCLB act and the crime have to be a felony. When I asked him  what is going to be done about the V.P who didn't call the police he gave me the brush off. I guess in Chicago someone can body slam and kick a classroom full of 7 year old and nothing can be done because it's not a felony. I have contacted the state Board of ED, the Superintendent, and every office that deals with the schools in this state and have been given the ping pong ball treatment ( bounced back and forth). I contacted my state rep. who called the school district on my behalf and are giving him the ping pong treatment too!  I feel like they ( the district) know rules were broken and are closing ranks. Should I get an attorney?  I just want my girls to be able to go to a school where they feel safe. Sorry it's so long but the devil's in the details.

But I knew that US was headed in the wrong direction after 8 years of Bush, and was in need of changes.       At the beginning of the 2008 campaign, I thought I was going to be a Obama supporter, partially due to the fact everyone else liked him. But I wanted to learn about his policies before I voted for him. After doing much research I really was not sure what exactly Obama stood for.       This was when I stumbled upon a few Ron Paul debates on Youtube. At first I thought he was just a old man and sounded pretty radical. Still he seemed to make sense and continued to watch a few more of his speeches and read up on his policies. Then everything he said just become crystal clear to me, we needed to stop policing the world, live within our means and not run other people's lives as long as they were not hurting me.       My support for Ron Paul was validated when his dire economic warning came true.

They remove the scissors and a suction catheter is inserted in place of the scissors. The brains are sucked out, the skull collapses and the baby is removed.       SICK isn't it?

I am pregnant and we agreed to wait till I had the baby because of possible complications. There is 5 weeks left till I have the baby and I get a letter saying they already submitted a demand letter without my permission, approval, and missing a bunch of information. I have to have a C-Section because of my injury (which cost more), I have a letter saying I'm 28% permanently disable because of this (they don't have), my insurance coverage got cut in half and the amount doubled, and I may have more problems when I deliver.

Why do people who acknowledge global warming or realize evolution is valid based on scientific fact criticize the opposition for being unscientific among other things and say that they don't use science when it doesn't agree with them? If the same people in question don't believe the life of any organism begins with the single cell of a zygote (result of conception) against scientific fact they are no better.    Ask a legitimate scientist if a single-celled or multi-cellular organism is alive while it is still growing and developing, respirating etc. Without fail the answer is yes. People would like to believe there is actually a legitimate debate about when life starts. There isn't. It's the same as if you would think the world is flat. It's not a matter of opinion. You're wrong, 2+2=4 etc. Why the hypocrisy, lack of understanding?

Yet the man who raped the girl is still allowed into the church? What's the go?    If that man had never raped the girl those babies would never have been thought of. And why should a mother have too possible sacrifice her daughters life for that of a paedophiles offspring growing in her child's belly?    It sickens me that people would really wish too penalise and judge victims (children and women) of rapists and paedophiles and have abortions made illegal.

20090307164702AAQrZwy	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What health insurance rights do unemployed people have?	My husband along with a few other people were recently laid off due to lack of work.  At the time, he was told by his two supervisors that they would keep him insured for as long as possible.  This was on Feb 2.  My husband took his things out of his desk not knowing how long he would be gone, and also asked if he could go ahead and have his vacation time because he needed to look for a job since we can't live on unemployment.  He never said he wouldn't come back when they called.  So a few weeks later my husband was injured.  It required a 2 day stay at the hospital, and at the time, the hospital said we were covered and we figured we were since it had only been a couple weeks since the layoff.  A week later when filling a prescription, we find out our insurance had been cut off.  They never told us.  Husband called employer and they said "we cut you off on Feb 5, we thought you were quitting", even though they never argued his unemployment and he never said he was quitting.  They also didn't inform us of state continuation coverage, which we found out about on our own, and were able to pay the premium on the last day we were eligible.  Now we're stuck paying a very high deductible, because the company changed the health plan, and offered to pay all costs over $500 for employees.  Does that no longer apply to us?  They think it does not.  Also we haven't been able to contact the others laid off, to find out when they were cut off from health insurance.  We think he might have been singled out, but don't know for sure.  If he has been...is there anything in all of this we could sue for?  WE live in Missouri, and I would call a lawyer, but since we've been unemployed for a month now, and they said it could be another 4 weeks before we see any money, we have no money.

20090307171113AAKEjL7	Politics & Government;Immigration	Speaking of immigration?	hi, you guys! speaking on the new president and his administration making everyone who came to america become a u.s. citizen some time in the future, it will not be. according to what I heard,president obama will only let those who don't have a felony record stay here.no gang members,drug dealers, trouble makers,will receive citizenship. I believe that congress and the obama administration should work with all law enforcement agencies of all other countries and have access to all its resources to finger prints,crimes,convictions,and prison sentencings records, to find out about these people. not everyone,but many of them came to this country to start a new life after their crimes. we wouldn't want someone living next door to us who is a convicted childmolester,killer,drug dealer,or anything like that,so why should we give other people the chance to do so when we don't and wouldn't allow that from people who were born in this country? furthermore, we have to control the borders. even if we reform immigration there will still be others who break into our country,and when they get send back to their countries after committing crimes,they will come back to this country as they are now doing. we need to really hold those we elected in office accountable for not protecting the american people. I didn't say illegals first and foremost. one more thing, how could they  them call themselves "the brown",when many of them are of european,indian,and black heritage. the u.s. government says that in less than another century,many latinos and other spanish people called "the brown", will outnumber  white people in america. I'am fine with it as long as it is done by the book. some people are afraid of change while some feel as I do. but we all want people to respect our laws. so what do you say?

The Plumas county Sheriffs did not let me and my fiance or his son file charges against three men that came to our home and attacked us last June! The three young men jumped my stepson and beat him until his father got his gun and fired a warning shot into the ground just to get them off of him. We told the Sheriff everything and they took statements and pictures of my stepsons bloody face. But they would nit let us file charges they said the DA would have to pick it up. But the DA did nithing these young men were only questioned by the Sheriffs and one of the deputys even told my fiance "sometimes a kid has to be able to take an *** wooping" when my fiance got upset about nothing being done. It left us feeling helpless and wronged! I even called the FBI because I beleive it could be catagorized as a hate crime because the reason the young men gave us for the beating was that they felt we were "N words" But the FBI didn't even call us back.    Now just last week one of the young men who attacked my stepson attacked another man in Stockton CA , in a hauntingly similer three on one attack that left the Stockton man dead...I can't help but beleive that if this young man had been charged the first time when he attacked my stepson, perhaps he would have thought twice about doing it again and that poor man in Stockton would not be dead right now! What can I do about this? who can I tell so this doesn't happen again? I feel that not only were we let down by the Plumas county Sheriffs and DA but so were the attackers and especially the dead guy and his family...I wonder what they would think about Plumas county dropping the ball?

My husband and I just got married 2 days ago and he had to leave today to go to Iraq for 11 months and I don't know when and if he will be able to come back for R&R.  I was wondering if there were any support groups with other military wives who's husbands are deployed because it would be nice to be able to talk with other women who understand what I'm going through and who have been through it before.

Obviously she cannot stand in the next election as Barack Obama is the incumbent, but imagine if he either lost or won and she ran for office again 4 years afterwards, so in 2016, when she's 69, could she be set to become our first female President?      What are your thoughts?      I should probably clarify that I don't necessarily want this to happen, I'm merely speculating.

20090307173343AACuMnY	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How much time has to go by to be too late to sue?	When I was three a TV fell on my left ring finger. I was taken to the ER and all the doctor do was clean it out, and I think they left it open for a little bit. I do know they never set my finger and it is now deformed at the knuckle, over sized all bone with a little arthritis. I cannot fit a ring over it, and the size ring that I can it just falls right off. I am now 19. Is it too late to sue or even get the hospital to pay for a correction surgery?

I know that all jobs in the Army support the mission, and people have their own reasons for picking this or that, and some would say kudos to you for having the guts to enlist. For me I'm always caught between being combat, or being in some kind of support role for career advancement. And then I get those feelings like I should do more, like members of my family before me. Maybe I'm off asking this, but I'm just curious what others think.

20090307163527AAFC8aG	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	What are the laws regarding noise made by children?	Recently, new neighbors moved into the house next to ours. They have an approx 8 year old son. When he is outside he screams and shouts when playing which we can hear inside our house with all doors/windows closed. It's impossible for us to sit quietly in our backyard without being disturbed by all his unnecessary noise. I've asked his parents to keep him quiet but nothing has changed. What are the laws regarding this kind of noise? Is there anything I can do to shut him up?
