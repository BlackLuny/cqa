Hi,      I have a new iphone 3g and I have been texting a friend of mine for a couple days.  It has been working fine but now we are hitting some complications.  When he tries to send me picture mail, I dont even get the message alerting me to it like I used to, instead nothing sends.  Im not even sure if all my text messages are sending correctly.  I am in NJ and he is in FL, could it be because the messages are long distance?  I am really confused.      Any help please?

I searched google a bit but I couldn't find anything about this issue. I have the newest iPod Touch release that came out a few months ago. Every time I go to the app store, that little icon pops up for updates, and it is usually a big number (it was 20 today!). when I look at what apps it wants to update, the versions are past releases of the versions I have now. So basically it's like it wants to revert my apps to past releases. For example, I have the "AroundMe" app, and my iPod currently has an "update" for this app, which is version 2.2.1 which was released on 10/22/08!!! 2008!!! I have the newest version, yet it wants me to download an older version?? Anyone know what's going on here? Thanks.

20090305053204AAIvKXE	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Whats wrong with my Playstation 3?	It was fine the other day and i've never really had any major problems with it. But I tried playing it last night and everything was fine, I could go to the playstation store, I could look at all my stuff, etc. But when I put a game in the little loading disk thing in the top right showed up and wouldn't go away, I tried all 10 of my games and none of them worked. So I turned my ps3 off and on a couple times and the same thing was happening. I did notice that when I was powering it up the fan would start up for like 2 seconds and slow down real fast to the point where I think it stopped running. I never noticed that before. So is this a problems, am I just screwed now?      Also      If I send the ps3 in to get it fixed or whatever, am I gonna get my ps3 back or some other one, is it new is it refurbished, should I keep my hard drive so I have all my memory.

20090305085004AASBP5F	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Help me connect my cell phone to computer, etc...?	I want to say first off that I'm somewhat technically challenged so the best answer will go to someone who can give me step -by-step instructions in a way that this dummy can understand them...      With that said, I have several photos and ringtones on my current phone that I'd like to transfer to a new phone.  If I am unable to do this, I'll probably just stick with my old phone (it's that important to me).  I connected my Motorola KRAZR to my computer via USB and the computer told me that it was searching for and then installing the appropriate driver...when it said the installation was complete, I checked My Computer.  My phone is nowhere to be found.  What did I do wrong and how do I connect my phone to the computer?  I searched online for drivers to download and all of them come with advertizing crap that I don't want to be bothered with.  Anyone have suggestions for sites where I can download a no-fuss, no-muss driver?  And once the phone is connected (assuming I can even get to that point!), is the process for retrieving my photos and saving them the same as usual?  I'd appreciate any help I can get (but I'd prefer the "for Dummies" version).  Thanks!

20090305080706AAB9ZjC	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	BT question (is someone there who knows BT's international calling plan? )?	Hi       is someone there who knows BT's international calling plan? (landline contract). Basically i sign for this contract, and i m using it regularly. the problem is, i ve recently received a letter from BT regarding this, they accused me to use it too much (not only for my personal purpose, but also for business and other stuff) and in this letter they wanted me to use it for no more than 10hours a month...      1st of all i m calling my familly a lot abroad (europe and us) so i find rude that someone who for sure ain t got a clue about the people i m calling tell me that i m using my phone for business purpose.      secondly, BT stated in that letter that if i m not stopping calling for less than 10hours a month they will cancel this contract without my approval. this is where i gone mad..do they think that they can only take advantage of people ?  who the hell on the earth got the right to tell me how many hours i m supposed to call everymonth when i sign an unlimited international call and paying my bills every month on time? is there any law to protect customer on these circumstances?       so i would like advice from people to tell me where i should go and complain and i should do. This situation is unfair and rude from BT

My DVD/Surround system is a Sony AVD-K800P, Component Inputs and RCA inputs.  I want to be able to use my HDMI port for best picture, but how do I connect my non-HDMI satellite and surround system to the TV?  I know I'll need an HDMI cable, but what kind do I use for RCA or Component Inputs?  Picture is okay now, but just running satellite to surround through RCA jacks, then surround to TV through RCA jacks.  Also tried SVideo directly to the TV through satellite and not much improvement.  Any electronic geniuses out here with any ideas???

20090305092358AAlS7aE	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	What is the best phone plan for a family of 3?	Two parents and one teenager who loves to text. It would also help if the provider has nice phones also. Soon, two more people will be added to the plan, making it five. And the two people are middle schoolers who obviously do not need the cellphone all the time, just somewhat for "emergency" usage.       Which provider has the best rates, not known for terrible fees and will benefit us the most and has nice phones? You know, for the ''texter'' person in the family, hehe, me! Just basically everything that Sprint isn't. That is what we have now and it is just not working anymore, terrible fees and bad service.      Personal experience is welcome!

20090305094231AAlzSPH	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Where can I buy a very big (100gb+) cheap MP3 player? (Not an Ipod, Zune or Archos)?	I was hoping to get a cheap unbranded MP3 player, but the biggest one I have found is 16gb. I only want to use it for listening to music, so I don't need a media player like an Archos. I don't particularly want to get an Ipod as I want to be able to connect it to any computer without losing all of the music on it. I don't know much about the Microsoft Zune, but they are quite expensive.      I know that most MP3 players of this size are going to be fairly expensive, but a while ago I managed to find an unbranded 160gb MP3 player being sold on ebay. (The seller was selling many of this MP3 player) It was being sold for ￡97. Regretfully, I didn't buy one at the time and now I can't find them on ebay anymore.      I was hoping to get one for this price but I will spend more if I have to, so if anyone knows of where to get a fairly cheap, large MP3 player it would be of great help.      I'm willing to buy from any country online.      Thanks.

(it was brand new and wasn't a dodgy seller). For two days, the texts haven't been sending. The process, like most, is that once you've pressed send, it goes to the outbox to send then goes to the 'sent' box. But, all the texts recently go the outbox to send then say 'waiting' under. After a while it will say messaging failed. My house has bad signal as it is, but outside and different places i've had the same problem. I'm not sure what to do, or whether it will clear itself out. With it being Ebay too, i'm not sure what rights i have.   AmYO.o
