764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I'm not sure how your parents are, whether they're strict and don't want you dating or they'd specifically be against your boyfriend because of his age. But, if I were you mom and you came to me and told me that you had been secretly sleeping over your 19yr old boyfriend's house, I would forbid you to continue in the relationship and I wouldn't at all be supportive. I'm not even coming from the position of a person who feels he's too old for you. I'm coming from a position of a 32yr old woman who was with a guy 9yrs my senior, whom I met when I was only 15. I hid him from my mom for 2yrs and was still only 17, when I told her about him. He was going on 25 at the time. He was a good guy and I was with him for over 12yrs, until he passed away. So, I know it's possible for this guy to be a good guy and for your relationship to be real. So, when I tell you that I understand what you're going thru, believe it. <br>  <br>  The reason why I would forbid your relationship- and what I've learned since being a teenager-  because I would know that you weren't mature enough to handle an adult relationship. That is the one thing I never realized back then, that I do now. When you're mature enough to handle something like that, you no longer lie about it or sneak around. You become bold about your boyfriend and the love you have for him. You're not ashamed and will defend your right to be with him with your life. <br>  <br>  So, if I were you, I'd start by thinking about how I could explain lying about him and what I had been doing to be with him. Because regardless of how old he is, if you have sneak and duck and hide, it's a sign of immaturity. Grown folks can be immature, so it isn't really about your age. In talking to my mom, I would start by confessing what I was doing and why I was lying about it. I would then ensure that she knew that I didn't want to lie anymore and I wanted to be free to outwardly show my love for him, if I wanted to. I would- in the most respectful way possible- let her know that I was aware of the consequences of sleeping with him (goodness know I hope you think about those things) and that I wanted to show more responsibility by getting on bc. I would open the lines of communication, seeking the benefit of her advice based on her past relationships. If I had it to do over again and could incorporate what I know now with what I thought I knew then, this is how I would do it.<br>  <br>  Oh, and as a mother I would have a SERIOUS talk with his parents because although he's 19, they know you're not and they aren't at all conducting themselves as responsible adults. There is no way in the world that they should've been permitting you to spend the night without knowing how your parents felt about it because your parents could easily press charges, so his parents are doing nothing to protect their own child.|`|9twZdl6laa	Can I ask what is the matter with his parents that they're allowing a 16 year old to "sleep over" at their house with their 19 year old son?  If it were my daughter, the relationship would be over yesterday!|`|6L9jJnchaa	Well, you started it with a lie, so you already made it harder for yourself.|`|lzivF4Idaa	"mom, dad....ive been sleeping over my 19 yr old boyfriends house every saturday without you knowing" <br>  <br>  that should do it!!! see how it works out for you!|`|8oAlBL91aa	They aren't going to tell you to break up with him being you have been together for 2 and half years and they should be happy because guess what your not pregnant and that would be the first thing they think of when they hear 19 OMG he is going to get her pregnant at least that's how everybody saw mine and my husbands age difference when we first started to date he was 21 and I was 17 and for some reason I got a Melissa Ann what is wrong with you as if I was breaking some law. But were 22 and 26 now. Just tell them maybe they will be happy.|`|1L1AxWoXaa	My dear you are just going to have to suck it up. You are dating an "adult" while you are still considered a minor. First of all it is illegal in some states. Not to mention you have been lying to her parents for 2 1/2 years. You have been staying the night with him as well. Sweetheart you are only 16! Overnight visits should not happen until you are legally an adult. You have seriously damaged the trust that your parents think they have with you.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	he's too old for you. that's what they'll tell you and they're right, but you dont want to hear that, do you?<br>  <br>  well..when you're pregnant and he's runnin', you'll listen to your parents then.|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	go up to your parents and say " hey im dating this guy who is 19 and i really like him and i would appreciate if you wouldnt judge"|`|AA12088442	just tell them then say u dumped him if they say u have to... then b like im going out with someone else and hang with him again<br>  haha|`|bpe8XVWDaa	You should just be honest with them and before talking to them make sure they're in a good mood.|`|NV63g5f2aa	you need to just come clean with them.... just talk to them tell them to hear you out before they respond|`|pdd9KNhaaa	well, u are 16 and if worse comes to worse and they pull the statutory rape BS, legally since ur 16 thats not against the law. if he is a good man, and good to u, if he is responsible-tell them of all his great qualities and how wonderful he treats their daughter...they should respect that. tell them, well mom n dad, its no different than if i wass 22 and he was 25...happens all the time. i wouldnt tell them u sleep there...maybe wait on that part till they have met him...thats a lot of stuff at once...have him meet ur parents so they can  see for themselves if hes a nice guy, then it shld be smooth sailing|`|cAtWxJG1aa	how can you possibly sleep over at someone's house every saturday without your parents' knowing about it? <br>  <br>  just tell them.  waiting doesn't make it any easier.
SEzIkGNiaa	Peanut Butter!  Trust me it works.  My sister got gum in her hair, and we used peanut butter to get it out.  I hope it works for silly putty though :)|`|lTsPX04jaa	peanut butter|`|JPeNM8nsaa	Same happened to me, my lil brother got in on his p-jays because he slept with the putty<br>  <br>  but i still haven't found a way to take it off|`|AA11348344	Ice will work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oHNsAcInaa	Try rubbing it with an ice cube. It works for gum :).|`|iwcp9rJzaa	hide it.
ytE1q20taa	Not very bad actually, but I had just found out I was pregnant.|`|VHHis05Naa	At 11 weeks I was puking everything that I ate and felt exhausted and miserable.|`|5NUhhhWuaa	At 11 weeks pregnant I was getting fed up with not morning sickness, but all day sickness. Good luck with everything Amber|`|Q6usQV1zaa	PRETTY BAD! DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER.............|`|vQDah0NWaa	like CRAP!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  VARY SLEEPY ALL THE TIME|`|uLuoDmcnaa	i am 11 weeks and i feel weird
SEzIkGNiaa	I will!|`|3Psi4kBxaa	God bless her. I will pry for her before Mass.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 )|`|yugLcDE2aa	I will pray for your daughter, and for you. You will need great faith and strength to care for and encourage your precious gift. May the Lord's will be done.|`|8oAlBL91aa	I will pray for you baby girl I hope she gets stronger and able to come home with her family where she belongs.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	Im sorry you all are going through this but she will be a stronger and better person for it. You are all in my prayers.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Your little girl and you are both in our prayers.|`|9604dad549d1d9ec19f7dbd9698567fdaa	I understand what u r going thru.  My young son had Major heart surgery as a toddler and it was horrific experience, but guess what, there is a GOD, and prayers do work, I have proof.  I will pray for u, meanwhile, call your church to pray for your Angel, call families and friends also.  The more prayers the better.  God Bless.|`|3EiOobEVaa	I will pray for her. Just stay strong for her and keep your head up.|`|Yio80F4yaa	We are praying for her.....|`|NiKuG6RYaa	your in my prayers<3|`|S4su0f7aaa	i will pray for her and for you Expecting a bundle of Joy   guess what real things like this do happen dummy|`|UTCkWYl1aa	my thoughts and pryers go out to your little one I hope she gets better
jsdDgIuRaa	lmao<br>  <br>  Yes she should, hey it's a job.|`|sv4guUQNaa	no, she's technically entitled to the ssi & food stamps.  She paid into the social security system when she was working, that's what it's there for.  (revamping social security is another story) She's not doing anything illegal to get them.  She can work in other ways.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i think if she had the chance to work then she should take it HOWEVER if it's a porn or something she is morally against then no she shouldn't be forced to do it. i don't care who it is and if they have 30 kids NO ONE should be forced to do something like that|`|8oAlBL91aa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Oh go I bet that wouldn't be the best sight.....I saw her on a cover of a magazine about a week ago and she is on ugly women I mean they either didn't put make up on her or there wasn't enough to make this women look good enough.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Why would any self respecting woman work in the porn industry. She turned it down as she should, she already has enough publicity out there without having to add an adult movie to it.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My opinion is if a person is able to work they should but porn is not something I think a mother should get into.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	She should work but I dont think she should take the porn movie.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My question is, who the heck wants to show off that belly after having 14 kids?|`|JE8lRn7Caa	she had all the plastic surgery for something why not put it to use. As well as an insane person she will be known as a sleazy one as well.Dont get me wrong I dont condone it but what is she gonna do with 14 kids she wont find a job that pays enough.|`|3EiOobEVaa	That is something that she would have to make a decision on.  I do feel that she would work but not necessarily in the porn business. I personally couldn't do it. But again shse would have to amke that decision.|`|MLB9Z3qOaa	She doesnt have to but hey 14 kids no money at a point of losing your home well idk thats hard but i will think nothing less of her cuz people out there do it now exept they are not in the view of the public eye like her|`|f0a32e61345899913bee88cf33014f9daa	No.|`|2I5D78Sbaa	she gonna hafto she got 14 kids!!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Personally I think she should. Part of being a mom is doing whatever it takes for the benefit of your children.<br>  <br>  If I had 14 kids and had the choice of poverty and my children going hungry or swallowing my pride and making a million bucks, you better believe I'd take the porn job. And this is coming from a conservative Catholic who thinks a bikini is too revealing.<br>  <br>  She likes fame, let her be a movie star.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	OMG.. after having 14 kids, can you imagine what her body must look like? Would you really want to see her having sex? I'm not even making of a moms and post-pregnancy bodies; I just had one a few months ago and I haven't yet lost all of the weight I gained. But still.. And she looks mentally dysfunctional in the face. Her eyes don't look like that of a normal person. So, I worry about those kids somewhat. <br>  <br>  As far as her being morally obligated to work, I do agree with that. I read that she was a graduate student so if she already has a bachelor's degree in something, I can't see why she can't get a job doing something either in that field or closely related. I know jobs aren't out here just waiting but she should be able to get something. The only thing about her working.. who's gonna take care of all those kids? We have a United Parenthood Organization in my city where children of low income families can attend day care for free but that would only be cheap for the parent as somebody (the taxpayers) still have to financially sustain those programs. If she didn't rely on government assistance at all, the soonest she'd be able to work was when the youngest child was 5. <br>  <br>  I understand her wanting a big family but to have all those kids and explain to ALL OF THEM why NONE OF THEM have a father, is going to be tough. I know kids who grow up without a father and sometimes it reflects in the kids. So, I wish her luck.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Did you hear the new thing? Another porn company had offered her free diapers for a year if she did not sign the contract. The whole situation is weird but it also is getting escalated into something bigger. Just let the woman live in peace and get a job so she can support herself and the children. Sad to say her parents are actually living it up through this madness. Sad that family will sell you out for 15 mins of fame.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	hahahaha.WHAT?? well, I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. I'd rather work at McDonalds though. lol|`|W8UZebRWaa	Thats all people would want to see.Her tummy probably looks like a tin of biscuits that got left out and exploded.|`|01vMpHkWaa	lmao i thought that was a rumor<br>  <br>  and no..have you seen her belly?<br>  <br>  ew
1G3XPiq3aa	Well, if you've been very clear about supervised visits at your house not meaning anything more, and you still feel uncomfortable about him thinking you are still together, you could arrange for them to see each other at parks or playcenters with you there as well. Especially indoor playcenters if you're really concerned about him kidnapping your son, as then you'll have other people around if he ever does try that. I think you can also apply to have a social worker present at visitations, even if you're not there if you have these kind of concerns. You should contact them and see what they can offer. Good luck.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	All visitation should be supervised.<br>  You can have this set up legally and that's what I would do for your child's protection.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|E15fLONGaa	Why would you want a drug using, drunk driving alcoholic see your child?  Much less one who has threatened kidnapping?|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	If you only broke up last Friday no wonder he feels he still has a chance. Outside of that i think the arrangement seems fine.<br>  <br>  Also if he is a drug addict and an alcoholic. I would suggest he not be allowed even at your home unless he is sober.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well if you made it clear that you two are split up but he is still intent on telling you how much he loves you AND he has the above mentioned problems with drinking and drugs i wouldn't want him around me let a lone my child. but the choice is really up to you. as long as your remind him that him coming over is for the sole purpose of your son then i don't see the problem. if he starts behaving badly or making advances (liek you two are together) tell him to leave.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i dont see a problem with your arrangement...at the end of the day all parents seperated or not priorities should be whats in the best interest of the child. this is what you are doing....allowing your child the right to see his father an at the same time prtecting him if anything your doing a brilliant job. what would people prefer? he goes to dads alone and is neglected? it will not confuse your child he will get used to the routine you have adapted into your lives:)|`|Z2ayOQHFaa	I would make it clear to him when you tell him if he wants to see your son that he will have to come to your house! Tell him your doing this because.....and name everything. Im sure he will not think anything if you tell all of that. I wouldnt let him take my child anywhere if he isnt a responsible person. and from what it sounds like he's not. Goodluck!! If I was you I would do just that.|`|2I5D78Sbaa	take him to court and get supervised visitation. they will set up a time that he can see them at the court house or somewere like that.<br>  exp if hes saying about kidnapping and hes a drunk..i wouldnt even want him around the kids if i were you. but thats the best thing to do if you want him to be in their lives. and you dont hafto worry.|`|JE8lRn7Caa	Do you have any common friends let one of them stay at your house and you can leave or if you dont feel comfortable leaving hide out in the bedroom so you know whats going on|`|8iaCr4Vxaa	I'm wondering if this is about your child or you.  If your ex has all these problems then he should not have visitation.  Have you been to court?  Why can't you meet him on neutral territory, with other adults present?  Do the authorities know he has threatened to kidnap your child?  It seems you are more worried about people thinking you are still in a relationship with the sperm donor, than actually worried about your child. The chi.ld is the main concern here|`|MLB9Z3qOaa	Look dont think about yourself think about your child. If your relationship is on and off put him in child support and let them regulate something for both of yall. If you have a concern of his drug and alchol use around your child then yes have him see him at your house or on certain days for certain hours like days he might not drink like tuesday from 3 to 5. and have him call you when he wants to see him cuz that way you know he will see him. dont bug him cuz if you tell him pick him up when he doesnt want to then he might drop him off with a stranger or whatever.
KyFCYs0Yaa	I think this is normal, but I know it is frustrating! (especially when you have to follow him around and clean up the messes!)<br>  I know that discipline does not work. been there and tried that. I tried giving my son timeouts because of the accidents that he KNEW he was having. like your son, my son knew it was not okay to stand there and pee on the carpet. I think that made him scared to use to potty at all, and he went backward even further! <br>  Once I figured this out, I tried a reward system. Like Stickers on a chart (or just plain stickers!) When he would fill up a chart, I would let him pick a toy. Just a dollar store toy works fine. It is the idea that they earned it themselves by going on the potty. Also if he is into talking on the phone, let him call daddy at work, or Grandma or Grandpa to tell them that he went potty! <br>  Hope this helps. Good Luck, and stick with it!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	he's "training", so quit thinking he's doing something on purpose.  continue to encourage, provide a step stool so he can reach the toilet & sink, and relax.  it may take 2-3 yrs for his body's bladder/bowel habits to fully mature.
9a3sNrEqaa	well in my opinion the testing for pregnancy with ovulation tests has been misrepresented. I think that there is a *chance* you can get a postive opk while pregnant but like you i am a COMPLETE AND TOTAL POAS addict! And I had a b-HCG level of 10,000 so I wanted to see if the opk was positive and it was a BFN like no line @ all! SO I was a little shocked bc i have read so many times that the opk will be positive while pregnant. CONFUSING!!! lol so i think it is different for different people!  You can't determine how far along you are by using different mIu tests as well. Also you drs can't determine how far along you are by your b-HCG levels either b/c everyone is SOooOOoo different!!! You would think this would be easier huh?!?!?! lolll COngrats on ur pregnancy again!!!!|`|rKCpkBfmaa	Congratulation!!!<br>  And btw - ovulation tests DO detect pregnancy hormones too!!<br>  It's good to know - you can always use them if you've got some left.<br>  <br>  30mi/ml is not so sensitive. It's better to look for 10miu/ml - they can detect ovulation/pregnancy hormones sooner.<br>  <br>  One more thing - <br>  I am due 28th of October 2009, so close to you!!!<br>  24th of Oct was my last one - and I gave a birth a day after it.|`|xayYdIfHaa	Congrats on your BFP. I know I saw you around the TTC section, but didn't realize you'd got your BFP!<br>  Guess the baby dust worked for you! Good luck|`|4XTxSfR7aa	congrats huni!|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	Youre testing for pregnancy on an ovulation test? Um... you should get pregnancy tests to test for pregnancy. <br>  <br>  The difference between a 10miu test and a 30 miu test is that they test for different amounts... and before 25miu you are not medically considered pregnant because SO many early pregnancies result in miscarriage before a woman even knows she is pregnant. <br>  To test positive on a 30 miu test you need to test the day after you expect your period.<br>  You can test earlier with some brands but you could get false negatives or you could not even be pregnant and just wasting your money (and energy) by testing too soon.

8z03BV5Saa	Hey I'm a triplet. And people could pretty much tell right away that we were triplets. We would say "I'm Leighton-Carrie and these are my triplet sisters Lelland and Lauren." No, we would say-these are my sisters|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yup... that sounds about right... or you can say this is my sister...we have another siblings too and we are triplets|`|192VzAFGaa	Good point.

NyNMe8jWaa	it may not necessarily be the chicken pox vaccine, but it could be a bad reaction to that or one of the other three in the series that she received.  CALL YOUR PEDIATRICIAN NOW!  my main concern is not just that she's been in pain at the injection site (that's not so unusual given that she had four at the same time), but the fact that she's so lethargic AND her temperature keeps rising (even by small degrees).<br>  <br>  if nothing else, at least you'll know that you got the best advice possible from a trained professional.  if this is a bad reaction, or something more serious, it's better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My brothers had a similar reaction to each set of shots which is why we delayed and will only do one shot at a time. It lasted about a week each time. I would call the doctor to let them know and see if they want you to come in. Otherwise just keep an eye on her and keep the motrin going until it passes. I know it stinks to keep them all drugged up.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	call them asap... my nephew had a bad reaction to a vaccine and stopped crawling and is now somewhat a vegtible|`|MAh2yKFnaa	she needs baby tylenol or motrin and if this breathing thing is enough to alarm you take her to the ER. I think they do that while they sleep normally, mine did sometimes. I don't recall it at 14mo though...so use your very own mommy disgression and do what you feel you need to. Low fever and lethargy is pretty normal with vaccines.|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	Oh my goodness, poor little baby! My daughter is almost 13 months and she just had the same shots. She was her normal self within three hours. You should def. get your lil girl checked out! And having her under Motrin for days at a time sounds really dangerous. Good luck!!|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Definitely call your doctor!!! Your daughter it having a bad reaction to one of her vaccines!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	massage her legs more and inform the pediatrician.

vOFdHvlvaa	I love the name Gwendollyn it's one of my fav girls names, i prefer it spelled with only one 'l', but that's just me lol.<br>  Gwendollyn Renae is very cute.<br>  Gwen is anadorable nickname.<br>  Develyn is a name i've never heard before, not sure whether i like it or not, it's def. different, and i dunno if the 'lyn' on 2 outta the 3 names sounds right, but that's just me lol, so yea.<br>  Lyn is a cute nickname.<br>  Ryan is ok, but i prefer it as a boys name lol, but that's mainly cuz i have a nephew named that and i've never known a girl with the name Ryan, so yea.<br>  Ryan Jacquelyn is cute though, but i think u should switch it around and do Jacquelyn Ryan and call her Jackie and that way they all end in 'lyn' and then it doens't look so weird lol, but that's just a suggestion.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, ur gonna need it lol, :D.|`|qitXGd0qaa	Gwen and Lyn rhyme, I don't like it. <br>  <br>  Develyn sounds like "devil in" bad idea.<br>  <br>  Ryan is o.k. but Ryanne is prettier for a girl.<br>  <br>  Gwendollyn is o.k. too but not my favorite.<br>  <br>  Working with what you already have in mind, what about:<br>  <br>  Jacquelyn Eve<br>  Gwendollyn Renae<br>  Ryanne Michelle/Elizabeth/Isabelle/Grace|`|1S5AbPueaa	They are all leaning towards the Lynn. Just so you know ..you might want to choose names that are not as together sounding.My boys are Ian and Aiden and I can't count how many people mix them up and they are 2 years apart.<br>  I do like the name Gwendollyn idk why...?<br>  No to Ryan <br>  Develyn Jacquelyn to much Lynn|`|KOcCenrEaa	Gwen|`|1yC1tyeAaa	No offense but I dislike all of your names!<br>  <br>  Gwendollyn Renae - Maybe you could try Gweneth [Gwen-Eth] and you could still call her Gwen. Gweneth isn't so embarrasing.. What about Gweneth Adelle, Gweneth Vanessa, Gweneth Elise or Gweneth Estelle? Or Gwendolyn spelled right would be okay!<br>  <br>  Develyn - No way! Sorry, But this name is truly awful to me! If you want a more modern name, What about Avery Grace / Ava Grace? Ooh, There's also Vera, Sara, Leah, Breanna / Bree, Violet, Lyra, Heather, Alyssa, Olivia, Isabella / Isabelle / Isabel / Isobella / Isobel or Mariah?<br>  <br>  Ryan - The poor little girl would be confused for a boy by all her teachers.. (My friend named her daughter Ryan, and that's what happend to her) I like the middle name you picked out for her though! Jacquelyn is very pretty yet practical for life :). Maybe something like Rebecca Jacquelyn or Jacquelyn Rebecca? <br>  <br>  I hope I could help!!! Congratz and Good Luck on the Triplets!!|`|naN6fCJZaa	ummmmmmmm well by the looks of it u want somthing unique or original... and those r nice names... i have twin boys (leevi and lance) so ummm i think i can think of girl names for triplets o.o <br>  <br>  lol um... how about<br>  laniah russl<br>  mariah russl<br>  aniah russl<br>  <br>  and i would make thier middle names different (no ryme or same letters) just so they fel like individual ppl wen they get older.. multiples might b born at the same time but they arent the same person.. i would give them something to make them feel like their own person.. u know they'r going to want it when they'r teens... and sad to say it girls kinda do mature faster than guys.... i'll admit that even tho i am a guy ... so sad ....T_T    =P|`|wU94PVW1aa	Why have they all got a "lyn" in their name?  That's a bit naff. <br>  <br>  Gwendollyn is a horrible name, and Gwen is not a nice name for a child, only for an old woman.<br>  <br>  Develyn makes me think of devilled eggs or devon which is bologna.<br>  <br>  Ryan is the only name I like, but not for a girl.  <br>  <br>  Also that surname needs another vowel.|`|ValLVBcYaa	Gwendollyn is awful. <br>  <br>  Develyn is weird. How about Derval or Evelynn instead?<br>  <br>  Ryan is a boys name. Do not name a girl that. <br>  <br>  I don't like Jacquelyn either. Jacqueline would be nice.<br>  <br>  What's the middle name for Develyn?|`|3jzqG7Oqaa	I love all those names, but the first one is a little hard to pronounce. Good luck with your babies and whatever you decide will probably be wonderful names.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I like them|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I wouldnt name my daughter Ryan|`|VGij9p0Taa	Firstly congrats! <br>  Gwendollyn Renae Russl is very confusing due to the spellings maybe change Gwendollyn to Gwendolyn the original spelling this way the name seems more classier all ready. Renae is nice however prefer the name Renee. Gwendolyn Renee is very unique and classy. Have you thought of Genevieve Renee that would be very pretty.<br>  <br>  Develyn Russl is again unusual but I find Evelyn would be much better just because it is far less unusual with her surname probably being spelt wrong a lot of the time. I feel a name that she doesn't have to correct would be better for her. So Evelyn meaning life would be better maybe Evelyn Rose Russl. <br>  <br>  Ryan Jacquelyn Russl firstly Ryan is a boy's name meaning small king and I can't stand it on a girl sorry. Jacquelyn is a nice traditional name and I feel Jacquelyn would be a better name for your daughter a great name Jacquelyn Ryan maybe or even better the spelling Jacqueline? Also have you thought of Marilyn this is utterly priceless and so elegant.<br>  <br>  Gwendolyn/Genevieve, Evelyn and Jacquelyn/Jacqueline/ Marilyn how classy. Personally I would go for Genevieve, Evelyn and Marilyn! Sorry I was a bit negative hope i helped in some way and good luck!|`|01vMpHkWaa	ryan is not a girl name....
AA10196172	Sometimes symptoms could be anything. Maybe she's just stressed.<br>  Anytime you put Mr. Ed into the barn doors, so to speak, you risk getting her pregnant, especially without a rubber.<br>  <br>  It's called "decidual bleeding" - google it - sometimes girls have 1 or more of what look like periods, even though they are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Once it's been 2 weeks since fertilizing activity, a test should be accurate.<br>  <br>  Sometimes tests don't give an positive even when she is pregnant, because she isn't producing enough hGC (pregnancy hormone). If symptoms persist, see a doctor for a blood test. they are much more accurate. (If the home test says positive, then she is!)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If it's been 6-8 weeks she should take a pregnancy test definitely. It should be accurate now and that's the only way you will know. She has a lot of the symptoms.|`|9bPzzoIFaa	she needs to see a doctor because her breasts should not be leaking this early if she is pregnant, and i doubt she would be pregnant if you didnt ejaculate and you used a condom... but the breast leaking is a concern, perhaps she needs a physical to rule out the possiblity of other problems with her reproductive system...|`|h1AIzD9baa	hmm.. let me look into my crystal ball.. yes .. she is pregnant.. with a boy!!<br>  <br>  <br>  yahoo answers is not the free miracle pregancy test.. tell her to go to the clinic or take a hpt..  thats the only way to know for sure|`|5MBdJK4Baa	tell her to go get a home pregnancy test, or go to the doc for blood work its more accurate
AA10368727	I was born breach and I turned out just fine. :)<br>  <br>  Sorry, as one who has never given birth, I cannot offer any personal experience.  <br>  <br>  Two of my three children were born via Cesarean Section, so I can't offer any anecdotal experience on external cephalic version either.<br>  <br>  Don't you hate it when you post a REAL question and get NO answers?
gs2aPltGaa	I dont think she had the babies for the money. I think she genuinely wanted to not destroy the fertilized eggs so she chose to have them. which was poor judgement on her behalf. I dont think anyone should have children they cannot afford. it was pretty apparent from her first set that she was unable to care for them herself, thats why she stayed shacked up with her mom.<br>  <br>  2nd. Yes I do think it is wrong for her to have a donate here button on her website. I think this also adds to question number 4. I think she is playing the publicity part and trying to wean all she can out of the public for her and her children.<br>  <br>  I do believe she loves them.<br>  <br>  But sometimes love is not good enough.. and 12 year old can have a child and love it, does it make it ok for her to have a child?? Not if she cant afford to pay for the babies care, what people would think the child should do right away is to give the baby up for adoption so that people more capable of taking care of and loving that child can do a far better job. I think the same should apply with Nadya. She didnt want to destroy those embryos and she couldnt support her other set of children so she was probably better off having those babies adopted. <br>  <br>  I never planned my children and I have 3. for being 28 and single I found my way through college and I fully take care of them 100% without any help from anyone. The closest relative/family member I have to me is 24 hours away. and I dont expect the public to help me out, i wouldnt want them to, their my babies and my responsibility, Like it should be in her case. But what the heck.... its a circus in her circumstance.... I just feel bad for those children. How is she ever going to afford college for them. (im sure theres going to be some kind of public funding she plans on setting up when it comes to that time) harsh of me to say but Im sick of hearing about it and I am sick of her.|`|SX9zoVEQaa	she is nuts.....|`|hKJIDdVqaa	1. No<br>  2. No<br>  3.Yes<br>  4. No<br>  I think she has issues.   But I really think she had those kids to love.  With so many fertilized embryos I think she did not want to destroy them. Perhaps she felt some would not survive through the pregnancy.|`|DiqDCZU4aa	god only knows, i think its all too freakin weird, but i can understand her not wanting to destroy those embryos..<br>  BUT she should NOT have had  all those embryos in the first place... how the hell did she affored ivf being single with 6 kids??? i thought that was expensive|`|PQ9lgrC8aa	I think she did it for fame, like those documentaries on TLC. and the deal she turned down, what is she thinking. She definitly planned this, she filmed the birth an is now tring to sell it, wo on earth wants to see that. I think she'll have a nervous breakdown when the babies are home. Let the state do something about the situation, like put the kids in foster care or for adoption. I do not think she can handle it.  with 2 kids its not easy, 14, is not just about money to fend for them, mental and emotional stress is a totally different story|`|jjV0aikbaa	1. No, I think she crazy<br>  2. Yes. She's asking for donations when she's already on welfare, out at dept stores shopping for MAC makeup (come on seriously), Starbucks runs...<br>  3. I think she'll love them, but she's still a nut job<br>  4. I'm sure that entered into her mind, and she knew what she was doing.<br>  <br>  I feel bad for these kids, all of them. If I were the older ones in school I would be embarrassed. The kind of looked dirty. Someday those babies will look back at all the newspaper clipping and what not, and what are they going to think.|`|349ddfc2af3ae7ab44eb31c2fa7651f5aa	1.  No<br>  2.  No<br>  3.  Yes<br>  4.  No<br>  <br>  She truly loves those kids and will do the best for them.  The public is giving her a bad name, especially over the 911 call with her missing son.  My 4 year old disappeared on me one time and I was frantic, so I understand exactly how she felt.|`|MA9XuLlHaa	who give a ****
oSvwWFEIaa	most doc won't strip your membranes until your 39-40 weeks preg,it sounds like you might go by yourself  tonight if not your doc just doing an exam might make you go into labor.plus striping the membranes doesn't always work. and the can not brake your water in the doc office plus you have to be at least 4 cm because the Chord could come down in front of baby's head|`|g2elB8eDaa	I was in your exact situation and asked for it to be done. Then I totally chickened out because it can be painful. I did drink castor oil and went into labor 6 hours later and had a healthy baby girl at 39 weeks|`|01vMpHkWaa	just wanted to say its not painful<br>  i got it done 2 days b4 due date because i was 3cm and uncomfortable<br>  it didnt work...|`|gPg7qYGIaa	if nothing getting going <br>  <br>  by the sound of it best Option for u would be to get your water broken i don't think a sweep would do much good
17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Call your OB if you are worried, hon. That's what your OB is there for and that's what they get paid for.  Don't hestitate to call.<br>  <br>  Also try not to worry, even tho its hard.  A fetal heartbeat of 171 bpm at 10 weeks is GREAT!!  You've got a strong one in there, honey.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if by 8 weeks you have had a normal ultrasound and the heartbeat is above even 160 your chances of miscarriage are very remote.  At 10 weeks, your pregnancy is very well established barring rare complications. <br>  <br>  This very slight spotting (one drop of pink blood)  might possibly be further implantation bleeding as the pregnancy burrows into your uterine lining evern to get even more attached to your uterus.  I don't know what else might have caused this tiny spot of pinkish blood.<br>  <br>  If you were losing the pregnancy at 10 weeks you would definitely know it. It would be really bad, with tons of cramping, clotting, and tissue (sorry to be so graphic).  You wouldn't miss it, believe me.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I think you should relax, you seem to be fine and just pink is ok, some women spot in pregnancy.<br>  To be on the safe side, call you OB and make sure.<br>  I had bleeding at around 8 weeks and went to the ER they said the baby was fine and discharged me with a threatened miscarriage, now he is 4...lol<br>  <br>  Call your OB, put the doppler away for a long time as this is going to make you crazy and try to get some rest|`|tj3ULCeSaa	it could judt be a little spotting<br>  but if you are really worried then you<br>   should go see your doctor<br>  and check it out!! <br>  <br>  best of luck to you|`|vygYFdsSaa	What will overusing the doppler harm? I just got mine on Saturday and I'm having so much fun with it :) A little bit of pink shouldn't be too worrisome, but it would be a good idea to go see your doctor just to make sure everything is OK. If the bleeding increases or you start experiencing pan and cramping you should go to the ER. Go ahead and listen to bebe's heartbeat if it will make you feel any better, best wishes I'll say a prayer for your little one x|`|W7eboA9Jaa	that normal cuz but if the heartbeat u think  is still no moving u must go check to the doctor immediatly|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	have you had sex recently or had an exam? if so that could be the reasoning for the spotting. it's normal to spot a little after sex- i did all the time|`|FUNhlpiqaa	A strong hearbeat is a very good sign.  I bled a lot with my pregnancies for no reason.  Our bodies are complicated.  Don't stress this, however, call your doctor in the morning and run it by him/her.  <br>  <br>  Btw, I had a doppler with my last pregnancy and LOVED it!  I used it frequently and it would always ease my mind.
jOyzcJd7aa	Well it may seem that you can tell just by looking but that's not always the case. & I'm sure the doctor won't make it so obvious for you guys, I mean your not the only couple out there that doesn't want to know the sex of the baby.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Its not as easy as you think to determine the sex of a child from an ultrasound photo if you are not a trained professional.  I was told the sex of my baby because I wanted to know, and there was absolutely no way that I could tell unless the sonographer had told me and my husband.  All the the pics I have at home from the 20 week scan are not able to be determined whether it is a boy or girl.|`|OBn4a7rzaa	They dont have to look between the legs, and chances are you wont just happen to see it without them specifically going there to look. Tell them you dont want to know the sex, and they wont even go in that area, or take pictures of it.|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	Well, the position of the pics is all up to the baby, so if he/she is just showing off the "area" in a certain u/s, then all the pics might have the genitals showing but most likely your baby will move in other positions(hopefully) and just tell them you don't want to find out, and to only print the pics when it's not obvious of the gender. GL!|`|JExgGpgyaa	It really isn't that easy to tell just by looking at an ultrasound, like you might think.<br>  <br>  When they tell you the sex, they have to move about to get a better view on the screen, not by looking at the picture.|`|nfLyS1toaa	just don't have her give you a picture of the privates.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Even tho you may know what the sex of a baby looks like ultrasounds are not that easy to make out. Even tho my son showed us his, BAM seriously, we still had to really look at it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Ask the tech to not show a close up of that area.
Ej2EOsvKaa	Hi. want to know something that sucks..that its TOTALLY possible. <br>  <br>  One story I heard was that someone (not sure who) left sperm on the toilet seat and the girl probably the sister or daughter sat on it and became pregnant. <br>  <br>  Random things like this happen. Maybe in the shower someone used the same soap or the same sponge and there was sperm on it. But this is sooo rare. Hopefully the doctor checks you again and you are not pregnant. I know its scary just have faith. After all you didnt do anything. So dont worry. <br>  <br>  I have had the feeling of being raped in my sleep too..but you would most likely wake up. So dont worry! Ok good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|6eGZGEw4aa	immaculate conception?<br>  <br>  have you done ANYthing with a guy? maybe you have the wrong conception (no pun) of what a virgin is...|`|5MBdJK4Baa	this is just one very strange question|`|9d90d6340838dadae5f6e06bc1a61166aa	get a life lil girl and stop asking dumb question|`|0mZfOStiaa	Wow.<br>  Um, you need to go get another opinion.

You had to be messing around but no sex involved its very possible. you could have been naked around him sometime but something doesnt add up here. if you need anything just ask me. i can help
BIDy92Dwaa	Hmm generally people have implantation bleeding 2 weeks before their period. Not a day after. But some people dont even get Implantation bleeding at all. I'd wait a week before you test if you still dont have your period. It will most likely come up postative by then.|`|a886990db3da72f9049b5468f25f3bdcaa	It sounds like you have completly different menstrual cycles then me, but mine start out that way. really really light and then half through the day or so it starts to poor out heavier|`|WYOAhvVIaa	I think I got it yesterday, which is two days before my period is do .. I'm hoping for a BFP :]
fHjSonssaa	Personally, I would- I don't think I would be able to relax and wait.<br>  It's an interesting question though- because the DR wouldn't have scheduled the appt that far out if they didn't  think it was safe- they don't really play around with pregnant people and thier babies usually- so if they are AWARE that your fluid is low and still let you schedule them as they did, they must be OK with it.  Perhaps, since they aren't concerned with premature labor, they are planning to give you steroid shots for the lungs before they induce- therefore they aren't concerned about low fluid along with developing.  There must be enogh fluid for baby to be ok- <br>  If there's not enough fluid for babies lungs to develop REGARDLESS of when they do the test, they will either test to see what the lung maturity is, or they don't have an option BUT to give you the steroids.  They wouldn't give you the steroids early because they are most effective the first few days, and are onlyl effective a total of one week.  Subsequent shots don't help- after you've received the first doses.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Well, the doctor is trying to balance immaturity with time left in the oven (you), delivery a little bit further in the future might let him have more mature lungs.   Try to get as much liquids as you can, it might help with your fluid levels, and I bet the doctor is hoping it was a temporary reading.|`|1r05fktRaa	yes|`|5Fgnvv0Baa	I'm going to say that your doctor knows best, and since he seems to think you can wait, you're probably just fine. 37 weeks is considered full term. Both my kids were born at 37 weeks because of the numerous problems I had. We did amnio on my second baby and his lungs were more than ready at 37 weeks, so try not to stress too much. If you're really uncomfortable with waiting, call and talk to an OB nurse and they can relay that to the doctor and together you can decide your best course of action.
vbViwCOQaa	you'r water probobly broke and you are probobly going into early labor.<br>  a back hurting is apart of the labor process and you should go see if you are dialated or not. congradulations with the kid and good luck|`|h1AIzD9baa	yes there is extra every thing in there.. if you are that concerned call your doctor.. not yahoo..|`|UtwcSsfpaa	Call your OB, you may be in labour!<br>  B'yn

They go to school for a long time for this.. I would highly advise against this! I wen into labor 2 hours after I had min stripped so it is pretty affective and if you do it wrong you could have serious complications!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	she should not risk baby and her health doing that...she should leave that task for professionals....y would she want to do that anyway because she is tired of being pregnant and want to jump start the process of labor? thats way too desperate|`|AA11220327	OMG!

It cost a lot of money 10- 1500 a pop.

1O45sCxZaa	don't freak out just yet. take a pregnancy test just to be sure.
JExgGpgyaa	For the answer above mine, it couldn't be in the falopian tube, because for you to be as far along as to be having flutters and lactating you'd be in the 4th/5th month of pregnancy.. An ectopic would kill you by the time you were 12 weeks (MAX) if left undetected. You'd be in too much pain anyway.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a womb, I don't see how you could carry to term.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You should go read this article I found about it: <a href="http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnancy-articles/546.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/pregnanc...</a><br>  <br>  From the sounds of it, if you had your uterus removed but still have an ovary, the egg could get fertilized and implant in a fallopian tube or implant itself into the abdominal wall. This is not a viable pregnancy though and you could not carry it to term. I suggest going to see the doctor. Good luck.|`|5d472f4bada31d035337b8856b1806e9aa	Well, you can't carry a pregnancy to term without an uterus.  If you have an ovary, then it is possible for an egg to get fertilized and a pregnancy to occur.  The fertilized egg could implant somewhere in the fallopian tube or the abdominal cavity, but it is not a viable pregnancy.  The body needs an uterus to carry a baby.
AA10196172	Very unlikely. <br>  <br>  There is sometimes sperm in pre-c*m (that little bit of early leakage that happens to a guy). So it's not impossible, but a shallow quick dip is unlikely to leave much. <br>  <br>  If he lets fly and it drips onto your juicy bits, then there's a real risk too. Sperm get where they're going by swimming in your fluids, so if he did drip so it ran into your vaginal area and mixed into your fluid secretions at the entrance to your vagina - then it's also a risk.<br>  <br>  Hot water and lots of soap will kill any sperm that isn't into your vagina. The stuff that got inside you, it's probably too late. By the time you got to the shower, it probably managed to swim where it had to go.<br>  <br>  The other thing is, if it wasn't around your fertile time you should be pretty safe, if your periods are regular. Usually days 10 to 17 after your period started are serious no-deposit days.<br>  <br>  For now, there's Plan B which is good up to 72 hours after the event. After that, all you can do is wait. Within 2 weeks a home test should give you an accurate result, if mother nature hasn't already given you a negative.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	it's most likley impossible.<br>  <br>  if you don't know whether or not you could get pregnant, and you are not ready for a baby. don't have sex.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Don't worry I doubt your pregnant. It is such a low chance .Just make sure you get your next period, but don't stress about it. good luck.
AA12033653	Sleep however you are comfortable!!  My doctor said it is more important for me to sleep then worry about the position I am sleeping in.  <br>  <br>  I am 37 weeks and STILL sleeping on my stomach.  It will not harm the baby!  <br>  <br>  Get your sleep because it is important, don't worry about the position you are sleeping in.  Your body will tell you if it is not a good position for you.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and happy sleeping!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Sleeping on your side is recommended, and really you don't want to sleep in any other position once your belly gets big. Think about it - if you can't sleep on your back or on your stomach, how would you possibly sleep?|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's actually recommended that you sleep on your side, your left side preferably to take the pressure from your uterus off of your liver/aiding in proper circulation.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	I slept on my left side with a regular old body pillow; alternating from my right to left sides.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	You sleep on your side.|`|Nhje1U06aa	on your left side is best. Its better for your heart and blood flow|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	Well the only u way u can sleep is on ur right or left side. Preferably the left because of better blood flow. Around 5 months u have to stop sleeping on ur stomach because the babies growing and u can harm the baby while its growing. Now laying on ur back aint no good bcause it hurts. Im 38wks and 6days and this is baby #3 so I knw.|`|AMyH091Taa	Lol yes you have to stand up.. Just joking. Sleeping on your left side is the most healthy for baby.. It allows the blow flow to get to him better. Early pregnancy belly sleeping is fine.. I slept on my back till I was about 30 some weeks and had a healthy baby. My doctor told me as long as your body is fine with it, baby is safe. I would advise against sleeping on your belly after to long but your sides are just fine!|`|6Rru2901aa	I dunno, but I' glad I'm not preggos 'cause I sleep the best when on my stomach. lol.<br>  <br>  Why you wanna know anyways?

YFPMcHCbaa	No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant. Almost all of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be associated with something else.<br>  <br>  Take a test, go to the doctor or do some research. This type of question is asked a thousand times a day.|`|IkVWct7laa	Some tips to reduce bloating and other PMS symptoms:<br>  <br>  --Go for a walk to loosen up your muscles and relieve some tension.<br>  --Eat healthy foods such as fruits and veggies and whole grains to keep your digestive system happy.<br>  --Don't stand in front of the mirror and brood because sometimes the stress of worrying about things can cause even more stress and make the symptoms worse!<br>  --Try doing some yoga to reduce the bloating.  See the article below for some specific exercises you can do to reduce bloating.  Do them alone though because a lot of bloating is excess air and you might not want anyone to be there when it goes away!
4WFN0awMaa	I think if you've never had these symptoms in the way you are having them now you could be pregnant.  I have 4 kids and did feel the way you are early on in the pregnancy.  I wasn't even 1 month.  So for your peace pf mind, I'd suggest you take a prenancy test, the EPT digital test is pretty black and white (pregnant/NOT pregnant).|`|vHl09tPmaa	You could be pregnant, but the nausea isn't likely caused by that. Unless I am much mistaken, you wouldn't get that so early into a pregnancy.
WZQKevt8aa	Your back hurt when you sucked your belly in because you were putting pressure on it by sucking your belly in. As for gaining weight early in pregnancy, every woman is different. Some people gain weight straight away and slow down towards the end of their pregnancy and some women don't put weight on until well into their 2nd trimester. Also, you may be putting weight on because you might be eating too many fatty foods because of cravings or just thinking 'because I'm pregnant you're going to get bigger anyway, so why the hell not?'<br>  Not sure, these are just some suggestions, but good luck anyway.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	It's almost impossible to do harm to a fetus at this stage of pregnancy.  Your uterus has barely started to enlarge and hasn't even started to come out of your pelvis into your abdomen yet.  You have not hurt your baby by sucking your belly in.  Even if you got punched in the gut at this stage (not sure why you would... just an example), your baby would be fine.<br>  <br>  I went skiing when I was 6 weeks pregnant.  Even if I fell, the baby would have been fine.|`|pOAZpvTuaa	are you craving things that has fat in it? because it can be that|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I don't think you've caused any harm by sucking in, but seriously if it hurts just don't do it anymore! Also, in the very early stages of pregnancy lots of women get really bloated, so that could be what you are seeing.|`|EbAMtQsHaa	um dont suck in are you crazy?? and your stomach hurts cause you just sqashed your poor baby
3kW6i3Vdaa	No you're uterus wouldn't be that large yet, it doesn't reach to that area til about 18 weeks.<br>  Sorry love.|`|AA11197832	Your Uterus will feel really hard.  Like a Basketball.
ENWrHP3Raa	Braxton Hicks. Here is info straight from baby center about them. I got them alot when I was pregnant with my daughter and at first they did scare me but I talked to my OB/Gyn about them and they werent anything but I would talk to your doc about them and let them know they are happening and they will tell you exactly what to do as they know your pregnancy better than me, a stranger, knows.<br>  <br>  What are Braxton Hicks contractions?<br>  <br>  Braxton Hicks contractions are sporadic uterine contractions that start about 6 weeks into your pregnancy, although you won't be able to feel them that early. You probably won't start to notice them until sometime after mid-pregnancy, if you notice them at all. (Some women don't.) They get their name from John Braxton Hicks, an English doctor who first described them in 1872.<br>  <br>  As your pregnancy progresses, Braxton Hicks contractions tend to come somewhat more often, but until you get to your last few weeks, they'll probably remain infrequent, irregular, and essentially painless. Sometimes, though, Braxton Hicks contractions are hard to distinguish from early signs of preterm labor.<br>  <br>  Play it safe and don't try to make the diagnosis yourself. If you haven't hit 37 weeks yet and you're having more than four contractions in an hour — or you have any other signs of preterm labor (see below) — call your caregiver immediately.<br>  <br>  By the time you're within a couple of weeks of your due date, your contractions may get more intense and more frequent, and they may cause some discomfort. Unlike the earlier painless and sporadic Braxton Hicks contractions, which caused no obvious cervical changes, these contractions may help your cervix "ripen" — gradually soften and thin out (efface) and maybe even dilate a bit. This period is sometimes referred to as pre-labor.<br>  How can I tell the difference between Braxton Hicks and true labor contractions?<br>  <br>  In the days or weeks before labor, Braxton Hicks contractions may intermittently become rhythmic, relatively close together, and even painful, possibly fooling you into thinking you're in labor. But unlike true labor, during this so-called false labor the contractions don't grow consistently longer, stronger, and closer together.<br>  What can I do if my Braxton Hicks contractions are making me uncomfortable?<br>  <br>  If you're within a few weeks of your due date, try these measures:<br>  <br>  ? Change your activity or position. Sometimes walking provides relief. At other times, resting eases contractions. (True labor contractions, on the other hand, will persist and progress regardless of what you do.)<br>  <br>  ? Take a warm bath to help your body relax.<br>  <br>  ? Try drinking a couple of glasses of water, since these contractions can sometimes be brought on by dehydration.<br>  <br>  ? Try relaxation exercises or slow, deep breathing. This won't stop the Braxton Hicks contractions, but it may help you cope with the discomfort. (Use this opportunity to practice some of the pain-management strategies you've learned in your childbirth preparation class.)<br>  When should I call my doctor or midwife?<br>  <br>  Call your caregiver right away if you haven't reached 37 weeks and your contractions are becoming more frequent, rhythmic, or painful, or if you have any of these possible signs of preterm labor:<br>  <br>  ? Abdominal pain, menstrual-like cramping, or more than four contractions in an hour (even if they don't hurt)<br>  <br>  ? Any vaginal bleeding or spotting<br>  <br>  ? An increase in vaginal discharge or a change in the type of discharge — if it becomes watery, mucusy, or bloody (even if it's only pink or blood-tinged)<br>  <br>  ? Increased pelvic pressure (a feeling that your baby's pushing down)<br>  <br>  ? Low back pain, especially if it's a new problem for you<br>  <br>  If you're past 37 weeks, there's no need to call your doctor or midwife just for contractions until they last about 60 seconds each and are five minutes apart — unless your caregiver has advised you otherwise.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	I was 29w5d and i started having mild contractions they would come 5-8 Min's apart and some would be 2-3 Min's apart.it feels like really bad period cramps but u would have more then 4 a day.|`|Nl3gv2q1aa	I think they're contractions.  I went to the doctor the other day and she was asking me if I was having them, but Im not really sure what they feel like because this is my first, and she said that it feels like period cramps.  I was going to say call the doctor, but I see that you have an appointment in the morning, so just mention it and go from there...Im due the same day as you are but Im having a girl...good luck|`|bGRexKPyaa	Braxton hicks!!!!<br>  <br>  If you get up and move around they should go away. They last only for a few seconds. Maybe 15.<br>  Your tummy may get hard.<br>  <br>  I'll be 35 weeks on friday and just started getting them this week. They get stronger and come more frequently as you progress through your pregnancy. Drink lots of water. No soda|`|F9AiIcVfaa	sounds like braxton hicks contraction. i have been having them since about 30 weeks also! no need to worry, unless they get more painful and about 5-15 minutes apart. its normal for woman to have these! they do not affect the baby, and are not making ur uterus contract! good luck and congrats on baby!|`|DeXRWlR6aa	Braxton Hicks, but mention it to your doctor.<br>  Your due date is a day after mine (May 16th!)
rTACLd3Saa	Absolutely!  It's your body and your baby and ahem... your hoo-hoo that's gonna push that 10 lb turkey out!  I think a lot of us, myself included, sometimes forget that the doctor works for us.  ANd they are well compensated for their services.  We put these docs up on a pedastal and assume they know what's best for us and don't seak up and ask all the questions we should or need to.  If you have ANY questions, concerns or worries along the way (within reason, of course, or your doc may be sending you to a therapist, LOL) you should feel comfortable enough with your doc to do make them known and get a good answer.  I know it can be difficult but I think a lot of doctors would like their patients to speak up more often so they know the patient is happy and secure in what's going on.  I'll tell you, I wish I spoke up and asked more questions during my pregnancy, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20.  Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy and congrats... a little early!|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	They won't send you for an ultrasound unless it is medically necessary because they cost money and hospitals are under staffed and under budgeted. Your baby will be whatever size it is going to be and you are already aware that your bub might be a biggie. You don't really need an ultrasound so a technician can tell you it might be a biggie. If you want one anyway, ask how much you'd have to pay. They might allow it if you are willing to fork out for it.|`|vygYFdsSaa	They might not want to do it because its not really medically necessary. But you should ask your doctor. He will probably do it if you specifically request it.|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	You can always ask but I don't know if they'll let you.  Good luck.|`|AA11197832	Usually Doctors wont give multiple Ultrasounds unless there is reason to beleive there is a problem.  You could ask your Doctor, tell him that your concerned that something may be wrong and you would like another U.S.  I cant guarantee you he will agree but you sure can try.  <br>  Or you could get a 3d/4d ultrasound, you can see exactly what baby will look like after birth, they can be pricey but you will be rest assured that baby is ok.  <br>  Good Luck|`|IFDfpbFJaa	They should give you another one before the baby is born to check the size...at least my doc in Utah did. They might, but insurance might not pay for it so you'll have to ask the hospital first.|`|AA11763588	Depends on your Insurance and if the DR feels that you really need one.<br>  <br>  You can always find a place that will do one for you, they normally cost between $90 - $400 dollars though.
AA10624857	If you are following the diet it is very possible to manage your blood glucose numbers quite well. One of the possible problems associated with Gestational Diabetes is having a larger than average birth weight baby. Some babies gain a lot of weight, especially in their upper body, which can make a vaginal delivery complicated. For this reason, it is typical for women with Gestational Diabetes to be monitored more frequently. I had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th pregnancy and began having weekly prenatal visits at 32 weeks. I was also 38 years old so was considered high risk. Most babies born to moms with Gestational Diabetes do not have any immediate problems after birth, but sometimes they will have low blood sugar which can be stabilized usually easily by either nursing right away or being fed a formula bottle. Sometimes a brief time with an IV is needed, but not usually. After the birth and before baby and mom goes home each will have several blood sugar tests to be sure both are doing well with their blood sugar levels. In nearly all cases, after the baby is born (actually, more specifically after the placenta is delivered) mom shows no signs of diabetes. The baby is not bothered excessively with testing. My baby was born at 41 weeks weighing 6 pounds 14 ounces. Not every baby born to a mom with Gestational Diabetes is going to be large. There are increased risks of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life for both mom and baby so even though there won't likely be any sign of diabetes after the birth, it is helpful to intentionally instill a good habit of eating healthy with your baby that will last him/her into adulthood as well as eat healthy and keep your weight under control for you. My "baby" is now 11 and is extremely healthy. I am now 50 and have been diagnosed with Glucose Intolerance, which is a pre-diabetic condition. My doctor has monitored my blood gluose levels yearly due to my having had Gestational Diabetes. About 2 1/2 years ago they started to creep up a bit and I will probably develop Type 2 Diabetes at some point in my life. It is understandable to be worried, I know I was. However, I spent time reading the literature my doctor's office gave me and kept a list of questions to ask my diabetic nurse. As I became more knowledgeable about Gestational Diabetes I became more confident that I was doing what I could to provide my baby and myself with proper care to keep us both as healthy as possible. Speak with your doctor about your concerns and they should give you some information that will be helpful to you.  ADDED:  While it is true that diabetes is not contagious so you won't give it to your baby, they will test your baby's blood sugar levels as it can take a little while to balance out for the baby.  Most typically a baby will have low blood sugar which is usually easily brought to normal either with an IV or a nursing or bottle.  Most babies are usually fine, though.|`|HM0cxcahaa	I had GD with my first child like you i failed the screening though my day to day bloods looked fine, until i was 34-35 weeks pregnant then they started to spiral down hill. They threatened me with insulin at 36 +5  and i went into labour the next day and delivered a health 8pound baby girl.<br>  <br>  Basically for me the GD made my baby bigger, but she had no lung issues or sugar issues out of the womb. They did a pick test on her when she was born. Personally i didnt really notice any non pregnancy symptoms other than I gained far much more weight than i should have. <br>  <br>  I have heard that because these babies can be bigger, obviously you may deliver earlier and there could be lung complications, or the baby could have a sugar crash. Also if you go to full term and its a big bub you might have trouble with a vaginal delivery.<br>  <br>  On the bright side, my diabetes left pretty much immediately after she was born and I did not get it with my subsequent pregnancy.|`|4t5eGShiaa	I had GD with my pregnancy. And yes, they do test the baby several times after they are born. Because your baby has to produce extra insulin while in your body to help fight off your sugar levels, when they are born, they could have Hypoglycemia (which is TOO much insulin)<br>  <br>  Normally, GD goes away right after birth.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much.. just make sure you monitor and control your sugar levels.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|j9axB0YMaa	I'm 34 weeks and I have gestational diabetes too. If you keep you blood sugar under control everything will be fine. As far as I know they won't test your baby at all because you can not pass diabetes to it. It almost always goes away right after birth. However it does put you at a higher risk for developing it later in life so be sure to maintain a healthy diet.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	If your bloods are normal when you test, it means you are controlling it well, so good for you and I hope you can keep it up! I had to give up grains and get my carbs from legumes during my last pregnancy in order to keep off insulin.<br>  <br>  Your diabetes won't affect your baby in any way if you keep your sugar levels under control. If you end up on insulin, they'll probably induce you early, and if you stay off it, they'll induce you at 40 weeks because it's not safe to allow you to go over. They will test the baby's blood sugar levels after birth until they have three good readings, but I think they do that regardless of mother's diabetic status. In most cases it will go away afterwards, but you will be at a higher risk of having gestational with subsequent pregnancies and of developing type two within the next 5-10 years.<br>  <br>  So, there is no need to worry, but you should use this as a learning opportunity and find out as much as you can. The more you know, the better control you can keep and better chance of preventing yourself from developing type two.
dOQ5yipDaa	Ovulation tests are very accurate - as long as you are using them properly.<br>  <br>  But by the sounds of it you may not be using them properly. I know with my cycle I am 29 days and I start testing on CD 10.<br>  <br>  Normally with most ovulation tests they are positive 24-48 hours BEFORE you ovulate. So its possible that you were ovulating on the 4th or 5th but because you only started testing on the 4th it wouldnt come up.<br>  <br>  So my suggestion is that you start testing from day 10 in your cycle until you get a postive.<br>  <br>  There is always the possibility though that you havent ovulated yet - however I think if you generally do have a 29-32 day cycle then you possibly have ovulated already just missed it by testing to late.<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense.
HEdGGmkhaa	A black stool can mean digested blood but it can also mean lots of iron. Are you taking a supplement with a high dose of it?<br>  I would call your local hospital, if they have an ask a nurse hotline or page your ob, thats what they are there for :o)<br>  I'm sure you will be fine<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|py57svUyaa	are you taking prenatal vitamins? It is iron in your blood that makes the stool dark if it gets there. But iron in vitamins easily changes color of your stool and urine. So my bet is your vitamins are the culprit here.|`|DTg3USppaa	Are you taking your prenatals? If so those do create a dark colored stool and brightens up your urine. <br>  <br>  Please call your doctor if you have any signs of pain or discomfort.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I take Iron pills and they make my stool black. I know that regular pre-natals have iron in them as well. That may be your culprit as well.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Call your doctor.  If you are on prenatal vitamins, it could just be the iron.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Are you having problems going to the bathroom? If so you could just be constipated. Sounds gross but the black in it could be the dried up stool. If you arent constipated then I would just bring it up to the doctor just to make sure. If you are constipated drink lots of water and apple juice. The prenatal pills will sometimes do that to you so I would drink atleast two cups of apple juice to make sure I go everyday. Good luck
AA12300309	Yes. With my first pregnancy I tested a couple of days before my period and got a negative, AF still hadn't shown up so I tested the day after my period was due and got a positive.

Once you get to the clinic get the abortion, you need to make sure and tell them that this is against your will and you do not want to do it. I don't think they would make you if they knew this wasn't your own decision. You're 17 years old, and it's YOU'RE child. Your mother can't make this decision for you whether you're living in her house or not.<br>  <br>    As for telling your boyfriend, I think you should tell him right away. Especially if he agrees that you shouldn't have an abortion, you could have him on your side too, so it would be both parents of the child against your mother. Not to mention that this is his child too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not to mention, you should be able to have SOME time. You can't get an abortion until a few months into the pregnancy.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	Oh sweetie! <br>  Your mom can't make you have an abortion. You need to make that decision because you are going to be living with it the rest of your life. You can adopt the baby out and continue your life if you want to complete college and everything. <br>  Abortions do have a time frame they must be done within. How pregnant do you think you are- like when was the first day of your last period? You can go to planned parenthood and they will tell you your options. I was 16, and thought about getting an abortion and hiding it. I told my bf, and we went to planned parenthood to figure out what was best for us and the baby. I kept the baby, and eventually married her father. I couldn't love her more. She's 8 now and I cry to think I was going to end her life. You don't have to keep the baby, but you will think of this the rest of your life, so make the decision you can live with and take it one day at a time. *hug*|`|C5ukKtxBaa	You do have options. This is your baby, not your mom's. She cannot force you to have an abortion if you do not want to. Expect to get kicked out, and you can room with a friend or go to a pro-life clinic such as Heartbeat. Please consider your little baby's life. This is a serious matter, you could kill a little baby. Adoption is a great idea. Please tell your bf. You will be in my prayers and I hope you don't kill you child.|`|3w7VztEWaa	Honey,<br>  tell you boyfriend right now. and ask him how he feels. and what he wants too.<br>  If you don't want an abortion than you don't have to get one. your mom can't force you to have one no matter what state or country you live in..maybe your boyfriend will feel the same way as you do and want the baby.<br>    <br>  <br>  Once you are pregnant all decisions you make about the baby such as abortions are up to you..thats your baby not your mothers..she can't tell you what to do with your baby.|`|pfkznTJsaa	Well first of all i beleive your bf should have known before your mom. Second your mom cant force you to have an abortion no mater what!!!!!<br>  im 17 and i just had my child 4 months ago.... i was in the same situation but i spoke up to my mother and there was nothing she could do about it... and now im happily married and i love being a mother :)|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Legally your mom can't make you have an abortion. You can tell the doctor that you don't want the abortion and they can't give you one, no matter what your mom says. So if you don't want the abortion then don't have one.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Your mother cannot force you to have an abortion against your will. There are options out there for you if you want to keep your child. <br>  <br>  I'd think there would be a wait period before having an abortion especially if you just found out today.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	There is no way that your mother can force you to have an abortion.  If when they ask you if you want to go through with the abortion and you say no they will not give you one.  What happens between you and your mother after that, you have no control over.  But you do have control over your body.  But if you go through the abortion, which I never have, you maybe sore and you may get depressed, especially if you are only doing it because your mother is making you.  You need to tell your boyfriend and if you go through it have he go up there with you.  I think he has a right to know what you are being forced to decided.  He is the father, he should have a say.  It will be best for you to rest at home after you have the abortion.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	They CANNOT make you have an abortion. You need to find a local crisis pregnancy center ASAP (one that is faith-based, not a abortion clinic like Planned Parenthood), to give you more options. It sounds like mom is trying to hide the 'problem' by getting you to the abortion clinic. Another immediate solution is contacting your local Child Protective Services agency, and let them know you mom is trying to force you to get an abortion. She is responsible for you health care, but you DO have RIGHTS. Your future childbirth can be affected after an abortion, sometimes you cannot ever have a baby again. Your bf needs to know, so you know how he stands. He may want to help you through this, and he may want to 'man up' and help you care for the baby. If you do go to the clinic, tell them you REFUSE to abort the baby. They CANNOT force you, or they are liable for malpractice. I wish you so much the best.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	"My mom is taking me to have an abortion tomorrow. I dont want one but its not up to me, im living under my moms roof."<br>  <br>  It IS up to you. You have all the say in the world on this one. Don't go through with it. The regret will eat you alive because you're doing something against your will.|`|9op65iQVaa	im a mom and I've been in your mothers shoes.  I COMPLETELY understand her, but I have to tell you, I regret it.  I shouldn't have put my daughter through that and on top of that, I shouldn't have put myself through that.  If u dont want one then you need to speak up.  and yea, your boyfriend should know...it's his too.|`|sjUNb9zXaa	I don't think she can make you have an abortion, if you go to clinic tomorrow & tell them you don't want one,then can't force you.
AA11763588	Wait another week and take a test or see your DR and ask for a QUANT blood test.<br>  <br>  Periods come late for numerous reasons, not just stress.|`|N89HLv92aa	I say wait two days and take another home pregnancy test, if you still get a negative then just follow your doctors advice, even though I think its a little crazy too. They shoul go ahead and test you if you feel pregnant. Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|EbAMtQsHaa	i agree with the other girl just wait another week and take some more pregnancy test if no then go get the blood test to make sure
qHAgbuHkaa	If you got a + then you are pregnant. If you got even one + you are, but you have had 2 +positive tests. Most people ovulate about 7 days after their period ends, and if you had unprotected sex 5 days after your period ended, then you were probably only 2-3 days away from ovualation and you can still get pregnant that way because sperm can live inside of you for up to 5 days. There was probably sperm ready and waiting when you ovulated. I'm not sure why you got - tests and 2 blank ones though. The - tests may have just not picked up the HCG pregnancy hormone in your urine. If your period was due on Feb 10th, that would put you at about 7 weeks 6 days. Your baby is already quite developed by now. Just a thought to keep in mind though..if you went off your birth control and then had unprotected sex, you were pretty much asking for it, so I hope you don't think its gonna be right to go turn around and have an abortion or anything. You should call the Dr. tomorrow morning and schedule an appointment. They will do either a urine or blood test and once they confirm that you are pregnant, they will schedule your first OB appointment. They usually want to have you come in for your first OB appointment when you're 8 weeks along so you're already getting pretty close to being due for that appointment. Make sure you mention that you have had some - and blank tests mixed in with your + and they may decide to do a blood test instead of a urine test since its more accurate. The only 2 things I can think of it being is an Eptocic pregnancy where the baby implants itself in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus or a missed miscarriage. You can have - and + pregnancy tests with an Eptopic pregnancy because the HCG is kindof all over the place. You can also have pain or weird twinges in your fallopian tubes. You can also have some breakthrough spotting and bleeding. Its something you should really get checked out just to be sure. Mention the feelings you have been having in your fallopian tubes when you go in and they may decide to do a quick ultrasound. With a missed miscarriage, you can have + pregnancy tests and then eventually begin getting - tests because the pregnancy hormones are dropping because you miscarried. Usually with a miscarriage, you experience heavy bleeding and cramping with the passing of clots, but with a missed miscarriage, your body absorbs the pregnancy before the baby really starts to develop so you never see any signs of losing the baby. In the meantime, you should start taking Prenatal vitamins to make sure the baby is getting all the nutrients it needs.Keep in mind though..its normal to have some mild cramping early in pregnancy so maybe you're just experiencing some cramping and soreness from your uterus growing.|`|afT6vw8faa	You should have an appointment booked with the doctor and he will do blood tests to make sure you are or not if not he will do an ultra sound to know for sure... =] dont waste money on tests go and see the doctor =]|`|61wXpXVxaa	Your pregnant or miscarried either way please see your doctor.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	Call your doctor and have them run a blood test, it is much more accurate, and then you will know for sure.

bGRexKPyaa	Damn. Poor girl.<br>  <br>  Im 16 and 8 3/4 months pregnant. I left my baby's father for being emotionally and physically abusive.<br>  <br>  I am so happy without him. I enrolled in a home school and I finish school in one week. I have a great job. It pay ten bucks an hour just to cashier. If i can do it alone, she can too.<br>  <br>  If you really like this girl. LIKE LOVE HER!!! and your willing to take the chance of giving up your dreams for her mistake and its not your baby then do it..<br>  <br>  But think of yourself too. You deserve the best you can get.<br>  <br>  I wish you guys the best!!!!|`|vGxipYJnaa	She can give the child up for adoption. Live your own life - you're not responsible for the child so don't give up your dreams.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	Live your own life, be there for there, but make it clear that you can't be that person for her. She made her bed, she has to lie in it now. Adoption is always possible. Don't give up things that important to you for someone else's problems. You'll end up hating her for it years down the road. <br>  <br>  It's okay to say no and still love her. YOu're not being a bad friend.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Don't give up your life and your goals for this girl and her baby. You didn't make the baby. You don't have to raise it. If I were you I would try to be there as a friend and be a positive male influence in the child's life but don't try to raise it as a father. Especially if you get involved with your best friend and then it doesn't work out it will only confuse the child later on.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Your question is poorly worded so some things didn't make sense to me. However you can help your friend without taking on the role of "daddy." You should absolutely not drop out of school. You can give her support and spend time with her without giving up your life for her. I do commend you for willing to be there, good luck|`|PLbmKNpvaa	You're a friend only from what you've said. You're not dating her, and it's not your baby. So be there for her, but don't take responsibility for the child unless you're going to have a relationship with her because you have your own life to live.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	i think she asking a lot for u if u can help out by baby sitting in your spare time that's ace but u have to live your life <br>  sit her down and explain u want to help anyway u can but not by giving up your dream look into who can help look after the baby with her
z6IekuwSaa	Yes it is possible,  highly unlikely, but still possible|`|5MBdJK4Baa	birth control is not 100 % effective..  you can get pregnant anytime  you have sex
WZQKevt8aa	You're just going to have to tell her, you never know she might suprise you. My dad did. I was scared to tell him I was pregnant when I was 17 (now 19 with a 2 year old boy), I got mum to help me tell him and he just looked at me and said 'Are you, how far along are you?' and that was it. Since I had my son, he's been fantastic with him and loves him to bits, it's the initial shock that makes them angry.<br>  Also, you need your parents now, it's a stressful time and you need to get medical care asap, so yours and your baby's health can be monitored.<br>  <br>  As for putting your baby up for adoption, if you know you cannot provide or care for your baby, the best thing would be to give it up for adoption. If you can, then keep the baby. Also, you need to tell the father, because whether you tell him or not, your friendship has changed 1: because you've slept with him and 2. You're now pregnant.<br>  So just tell him, he may be able to help you provide for the baby and help you make important decisions|`|QYYWBrG7aa	if u didnt wanna get pregnant you should have kept ur legs closed..Consider Adoption there is alot of women wanting kids that cant have them!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Well, you don't need me to tell you that you should have used protection or better yet, shouldn't be doing it at all unless in a long term relationship so I will spare you that lol<br>  <br>  I had a baby at 17, it was not the best thing to do, it did make me miss a lt of my life and I do regret it. Although I love my son, I can't get those years back. Men didn't take me seriously for years and the guy left me for someone else who didn't have a baby to tie them down.<br>  <br>  I told my mom on the phone as she called when I had just done the test and I was in shock. She just said we would talk about it later and she was ok about it really. If they beat it out of you, they will go to jail and if she kicks you out, remember that she is your mother, this is going to hurt a little and after all is settled, there will be a baby to call her grammy and all will be forgotten. You need her but it's best that you do parent the child without the help of your mother all the time. Thats where my mistake was, I took her for granted and she thought I was a baby myself so always did everything, it made it hard on everyone really....<br>  <br>  Good luck, just be honest and tell them the truth, if you are worried what they will do to you, plan to stay out the night and tell her on the phone.|`|rfWg60WKaa	loook hun. I just turn 17. I went to the doctors to see if I'm pregnant. I am. I told my parents. your mom can't kick . your her blood. she has to be there for you. she has to supportt you all the way. and about your little guy friend. pull him to the side. and talk to him . like start a conversation. then be like I have something to say. don't hide it. yeah your young. but who know you can become a wondeful mom.|`|qnGCIF2Aaa	ok watever u decide dont get an abortion thats terrible<br>  i would tell the boy first to get it of your chest and tell him it wouldnt <br>  ruin the friendship then tell your parents take your mom out to dinner that way if shes really mad shes in a public place and it cant get to out of hand<br>  i dont believe a parent would really kick their child out of the house but say that to scare u into not getting pregnant|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Mom, I'm pregnant. Simple as that, she can't kick you out.|`|92xRj1mKaa	your mom will not kick you out, they always use treats to control you, you'll be surprised how well she takes it<br>  <br>  but just in case she blows, a public place can't hurt|`|iJM4Zbhxaa	Listen i was in a similar situation my now wife and i were very young when we had our child. So i know how you feel, we were not ready but we chose to keep our son and i cant even imagine my life without him. The bottom line is to just come out and say it. If your mother doesn't understand or goes wild then that's her fault, I can guarantee you she will change her tune once she sees un ultrasound or once the baby is born. Nothing joins a family like a child. But i thinks its best to tell the father before you tell your mom, if he leaves then he is a douche, if he stays then you know your in it together and it makes telling your mom easier if you have support. Bottom line though it is your child, a life inside you and now its your responsibility to make sure that he/she is given everything it needs and deserves. Love!
PyAti6SJaa	first you should get married...then have a baby|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Instead of talking to him about getting married.  Talk to him about having a relationship together for the rest of your lives, if you are both comitted to that.  As you will be, if you will both be the parent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, Im kind of sick of these low standards.  If a couple cant commit to having a loving relationship for the lifetime of their child, why have the child.  Doesnt your child deserve the best.  If this boyfriend isnt interested in that, find better.|`|7lH5NPWPaa	Tell him that you will be able to have wild sex with him without a condom. Be sure to have wild sex with him to prove it though.|`|1o820L3Daa	I was in the same situation, I have a 6 year old to a previous partner ( who I left due to violence) and I have found the greatest man. We were together 2 years before I bought this up. We had talked about it lightly, but I felt I really wanted a baby. So I literally just bought it up one night. He was absolutely amazed I felt the way he did. And now Im 26 weeks pregnant. Just be honest, and open. and Im sure things will work out when they are meant to. Good luck!|`|vZwJyqc6aa	If you can't even tell your boyfriend that you want a baby, you probably shouldn't be having a baby with him.|`|61wXpXVxaa	I would just come out and say it a dinner or something for sure, and see how he feels about the idea as well.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	Marriage first honey.|`|X04FrI3Daa	What you do is pock holes in the condom, and then surprise him with a baby and see how he takes it. He could be a little angry, but he'll get over it then again he could be very excited it hmmmm it's a toss up... <br>  <br>  Just joking. You should direct your relationship to getting married before having a baby. It takes 2 to make one, and raise one. He may want a kid, but not right now so get ready for the let down. Don't push him into it. Just make sure your wants are heard, and that he understands. And can you support a baby make sure you can do that first. Have you seen the cost for diapers lately and formula man good luck to all you new born mothers out there.|`|gZcXQnTYaa	i would deff. sugest making completely sure you want to stay together first b4 you have a baby, and let you know that pregnancy (as well as having a new baby) can be very difficult on even the strongest relationship... now, to answer your question, my huasband says, "with your mouth." lol... his way of saying it may not be that pleasing, but hes right. we had only been dating for a couple of months when we knew we wanted to stay together. one day i asked him if he wanted to have a baby, and told him i did. he replied with "NO! are you crazy!?" (or something like that) soon after, he changed his mind, and now about a year and a half later we have a beautiful baby girl and are happily married. we too had discussed and decided neither of us were set on the idea of marriage, but knowing we were having our baby together changed our mind. just make sure you're ready first and good luck. remember, the worst he can say is no.
DTg3USppaa	I'm 4 1/2 months and I just started to get those pains...<br>  <br>  Described as:<br>  <br>  Sometimes stabbing and pulling at the same time, almost like the worst period pains ever! I had to hunch over once when I was standing up...it hurt!<br>  Sometimes its just a dull achy pain that just refuses to go away unless I lay down..<br>  <br>  Its a possiblity that your uterus is just making room for your baby.<br>  If you are really concerned and it hurts too bad, call your doctor!<br>  <br>  GL and congratulations!|`|ZK0uaSWeaa	PAINS ARE NORMAL. BUT YOU SHOULD CONCERN DOCTOR. BCOS IT CAN BE HARMFUL ALSO.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Were you walking too fast? If so that is more then likely what it is or just being on your feet too much. Also could be round ligament pain, making room for the baby. You will notice that you will get so many aches and pains. As long as there isnt any contractions and no bleeding you are more then likely ok, just rest and when you are tired take a break put your feet up. Good luck and congrats on the baby
AcEYEc0taa	What do you mean it didn't work?  If it turned positive, chances are you're pregnant and if it turned negative, you probably aren't.  If you want to make absolutely sure, you can certainly take more than one pregnancy test, or, better yet, take a visit to your doctor.|`|vnOViworaa	Condoms are not 100% safe so it is possible to still get pregnant (although they are something like 99.9%). If the guy doesn't put it on properly or if the condom is expired it can further decrease the effectiveness of a condom.

I would walk back in there and tell her what test you want or whatever you feeling and tell i would feel more comfortable if you would please check me....<br>  I saw my doctor when I thought I was pregnant I was 3 days late so I went in there and she did a urine test and told me I wasn't pregnant she was on her way out the door and i said look I know my body I have 28 day cycles and I have never been late....she said oh okay well I guess we can do a blood test....well guess what I was pregnant!!!!! I am 29 weeks and 3 days today!<br>  Her assistant was kinda rude about it too when she came in and did my blood pressure and when she asked me how late i was or what day I was suppose to start she looked at me and said you are technically not late you know....I just wanted to slap the crap out of her....anyways demand what you want its your health!!!!|`|mQhqRbRQaa	You definitely can be mad.  That's irresponsible and unprofessional of a doctor to treat you that way.  They have an obligation to treat anyone and everyone with the same respect.  I would complain if I was you.  Because what if you are pregnant, and her disregard could result in something dangerous. <br>  That has happened to me.  I should have complained but I didn't.|`|AA10953561	You have a right to be aggravated. Your doctor is working for you and should take your thoughts seriously and should never make you feel inept or stupid. If this is a first time incident, you may give your doctor one more chance, but if you feel like your needs aren't being met, then switch doctors.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11197832	It's Ok to be angry with people who tell you what you dont want to hear.  All you have to do is make another appointment with a different Doctor and get your second opinion.|`|VHivWlaXaa	It's okay to be aggrivated and hurt, you have a good reason. Simply say thank you for your opinion but i think i'll get a second opinion just in case. This way your doctor knows you doubt her and that your serious about how you feel. Besides telling her that her opinion isnt good enough will hurt her feelings like she did yours. lol payback is always sweet and you find out whats goin on with ya too. bonus!

bFP6jfvVaa	I prefer Jonas.<br>  <br>  And not cuz of the band. *rolls eyes* that's like saying every person with the name Nick, Kevin and Joe who were around before the Jo-Bros became famous were named after them. It's silly..rather, stupid.<br>  <br>  I really like the name Jonas.|`|SZdSFi1raa	Jonas, if you named him that he would have his own song by weezer.<br>  My name is Jonas|`|658ce47ce0cc957cc16a6932ea236794aa	Jonas is better.... although, right now he will be compared to the Jonas Brothers.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Love both, but I think I'd go with Thaddeus.|`|fboC1N7gaa	Jonas|`|VB7RL0Jsaa	Jonas, definitely!|`|DP48dIxhaa	Jonas is better|`|0hxK0khKaa	Jonas<br>  <br>  <br>  But I don't like the fact that it would be associated with the band, so:<br>  <br>  <br>  Thaddeus|`|FhlmiI7daa	I like Thaddeus if he goes by Thad
WsUSAgLmaa	Is an alien....lol nah it looks like the umbilical cord attached to the sac...I had it on my too the doctor explained to me its just waste in a sac|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	that's gotta be the placenta......that's the first time that i've seen a picture like that.  I'm surprised that the tech didn't say, "check it out, it's the placenta"....i don't think that you can normally see it.|`|T48smu01aa	could be the babies cord with his fist by it can't really tell sorry...just an opinion.<br>  Good luck!! and congrats!!|`|TxYcs9H9aa	It looks like it could be his hand.|`|MSIf48X7aa	looks like umbilical cord with placenta. However, if it was 'abnormal' the ultrasound tech and/or your doctor would have told you. Also, just an FYI, your ultrasound pic has a lot of personal info on it.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	It looks to me like it is the umbilical cord and placenta. If it was anything for worry or concern the ultrasound tech would've brought it up for discussion. It's fine. :-)|`|575w52loaa	I'm thinking that its the placenta and the umbilical cord. If it was anything weird I'm sure the ultrasound tech or the doctor would have said something.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	That does look strange, but it could be part of your uterus. If the scan is too close to your uterus walls then it will pick up on that.|`|qcvjUgHzaa	It might be the umbilical cord... I'm not sure, how far along are you?|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	Looks like the placenta and umbilical cord...what a good looking baby lol|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	placenta maybe|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I would ask your doctor what it could be. Did the ultra sound tech say anything?
KlJHZRSiaa	I woke up (at 10dpo) and the entire bedroom smelt like dog pee. I was convinced the dog had peed somewhere, so there I am at 6am on my hands and knees, crawling around the carpet. No dog pee, just a super-sensitive nose. So I did a test and whaddya know ...|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Discharge was my first symtom. Its was the same discharge as ovulation discharge but happend when I wasnt ovulating|`|RV3oeESvaa	i was spotting and couldnt stand the smell of eggs. my breast were getting bigger and i was sleeping more than usual and also peeing alot!|`|a9LgRjb3aa	i had to pee every five minutes, tender breast,nausea and was tired alot and began eating more|`|AA10967880	mine was actually really painful cramping. i got a little more moody and my periods didnt come early like normal. now im gettin sensitive to foods i odnt have morning sickness but certain tastes make me feel sick like i cant have sweet and sour corn makes feel yuck and so does red meat plus now i like strawberry thickshakes that i havent had since i was 10.|`|IAllZ5bLaa	after only 2 weeks my breasts began to feel a little heavy, extremely sensitive. After 4-5 weeks I started getting constipated and nauseous (this is actually what convinced me to take the test.) I'm still kinda freaked out hehe, i just found out about 3 hours ago I really am preggo!|`|2IPhSWkxaa	i was 3 weeks pregant and i would P all time so i took a pregance test. and sure enough i was.<br>  that was the only symptom i had besides being tired all the time.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I had cramping that I remembered doing with my son and I had this surge where I was nervous and thought, "How will I take care of two kids?!"  I knew I was pregnant.  I had to be!<br>  <br>  I also got incredibly thirsty, HUNGRY, craving subway, my nipples hurt really bad.  And I noticed something different that I now remember.  Well, at the tail end of my last pregnancy I kept leaking and thought it may have been my amniotic fluid.  So, I read up and it said it would be chemically smelling and normally my pee just smells like.  . . well pee, well at the tail end of my pregnancy it had a sweet smell.   Which apparently is a sign of pregnancy because of your blood or something.  My husband was saying something about that.<br>  <br>  Well, my pee smelt sweet again.  This was before I found out I was pregnant and sure enough I was again.  My pee only smells sweet when I am pregnant.  So, not sure if that would be a sign or not for you, but it works for me!  =)|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	I was on the pill - taking it regularly and never missed any - so i had no idea i might be pregnant. My husband kept suggesting i test<br>  <br>  I had sore breasts, tiredness, nausea and frequent urination for about 3weeks before i found out i was pregnant (at 5weeks)
bGIKzvBEaa	hi, thank you for answering my question! anywho, since you had more spotting than an actual period i would say thats a deffinite indication of pregnancy. also, they say that pms symptoms are crazy similar to pregnancy symptoms so since your "pms" symptoms are 21 days early i would say they are most likely pregnancy symptoms! good luck!|`|x5aJcD9zaa	Yes.  I am currently 16 weeks pregnant, but only found out at 10 weeks.  This was because I was having what appeared to be my usual periods.<br>  <br>  I only got suspicious because my breasts felt all tingly and enlarged, so I took a pregnancy test, and it was positive.|`|a9LgRjb3aa	i spotted for like a day or to the i felt breast tenderness and notice i was eating more often so i took a test and was pregnant
LTTips1vaa	I recommend the Cuisinart food processor.  Once the food is purred then freeze in ice cube trays with wax paper on top.   Give a day to freeze the cubes.  Once frozen place in a ziploc bag.  This makes it convenient for meals by just taking out a cube.<br>  <br>  Get a hands free gate is all i can recommend.  We have one with a foot petal which is really nice when your hands are full.  Only draw back is my son figured out how to jump on it at an early age to get into the kitchen..|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Don't know about today's gates, but you don't need anything fancy to make baby food.  All it takes is a mini food processor, or a blender.  It's easy, and mostly a matter of adding some stock, water, or fruit juice (depending on what you're making) to process to the consistency the baby needs.<br>  <br>  For example, I'd make chicken soup for the family.  Then, I'd process some for the baby to the chunkiness that worked for her at that age, then I'd freeze it in cubes and bag it.  Instant baby food!  As the baby gets older, process less, or start to hand chop food into small bits straight from your plate.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	For making baby food, I just use my blender.  I have a baby food mill that makes me nuts, but it's good for mashing up small amounts of things.  I wouldn't recommend it, though.|`|VK3uWrs1aa	try it and tell me when you are done
GZYN1rCTaa	If you're late, that's the best time to take a test.  I would say to wait 12 days after you ovulate, but it doesn't sound like you are sure of that date.  However, you are a week late.  If you are pregnant, you should get a positive by now.|`|yp9rEMSraa	You can take one now!  if it shows up negative do another one in a week<br>  Best of luck|`|10csHNHkaa	ASAP You could be and then not, especially if your stressed out. That sometimes delays my periods. STRESS SUCKS!
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	My son is 7 months too and is about on the same schedule.<br>  <br>  He goes to bed are 9pm and wakes around 7am.  He then naps for an hour of so at 10am and again at 3pm.  <br>  <br>  You are not feeding your baby too much.  They are now at the age that they will pull away or stop eating when they are full.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest offering some milk after the solid foods, just to totally fill her tummy. We are feeding my son 6 times a day every 3 hours, it's easier on us and he is satisfied.|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	Around this age they will go through growth spirts---yes my daughter by 1 month was sleepin 10-12 hours at night and one or two naps of 1.5 hours........they;ll sleep as much as they need and it is normal for them to eat that much|`|BfBMRlNNaa	Sounds like she's sleeping the perfect amount of time. At that age I was feeding my daughter every  3 hours or so and I usually nursed  in addition to the solids to give her a drink, either that or she had some juice. Unless your daughter seems hungry I would go ahead start stretching out the times between meals.
7rCeCVl2aa	There is nothing you can do unless you can prove she is a threat to your child.<br>  <br>  BTW how did he get custody of his wife's son? When you are married you automatically BOTH have custody of the child.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	nothing<br>  grow up|`|dH6lBcGlaa	You have no leagl recourse in the eyes of the law to dictate who your ex has your child around. Sorry. Unless she is abusive, on drugs, or some other terrible lifestyle choice, you can't prevent it. And if you could prove the previous, you would have to take it to court which would be very costly.|`|3w7VztEWaa	you can put a restraining order on her..<br>  but I'm not sure of all the conditions.<br>  I mean I'm pretty sure that something can happen I mean he's your son and if you don't want someone to be around him than you should have the right to do that.|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	dont keep him away from his son just because he left you thats not fair to your kid..even though your only 17 you need to grow up, you have a child now.|`|F2wI6NGNaa	lol the wh*re in the situation is complaining anything bad that happens to you you deserve it|`|5Np8w5MCaa	There really isn't anything that you can do.  Unless you fear for your sons well being while he is in her presents then there is nothing that can be done.  My husband has a daughter with his ex girlfriend and there was a problem with visitation for a while because she didn't want my near her daughter.  Because my husband and I are a family there was nothing she could do.|`|K5WoPLBCaa	i have been in the same situation. the only way the courts will allow this is if you can prove that the april girl could pose harm to your child. my situation was a little different. i chose to forego all contact with the father and he hasnt contacted me since. he obviously chose his insane wife over his child, but hey, it will be better for my child in the long run imo. each situation is different.|`|AAlB49iraa	if his name is on the birth certificate he has rights. also if he is paying child support he is allowed visitation. you need to see a lawyer or contact free legal aid in your state. google legal aid for your state and get a toll free number to call.
LEuPv4bfaa	I am also started my first round of 50MG Clomid on Wednesday which will be my CD 5. I can't really tell you what to expect, but I am glad someone is at the same place I am! Truckloads of babydust to both of us and everyone else out there!|`|D11S8dzIaa	Good Luck!|`|2zC1lpfVaa	Well, I just had 3 rounds of clomid 50mg, and felt miserable that just decided to stop and rest for a cycle or more, before continuing again.<br>  <br>  Actuall the side effect may vary between person, but probably it will enlarge your ovaries, it will make you bloated, make your belly turn big, and you will feel like pregnant when not.<br>  <br>  And as why I was felling miserable.. Probably from going through all the stress, and lately on this last cycle I had been having lot of symptons that may be PMS, pregnancy, or just side effect of the clomid... but just noticed that my belly has grown so much, and I am pretty confident that AF is coming soon... So I just felt so stupid looking like a preggo when I am not, and looking so ridiculous on my regular clothes.... And my husband telling me that I need to go into diet!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, sorry.. going back to the clomid.. you will ovulate (if you ovulate at all) 5 to 10 days after having taken your last pill.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and baby dust to you!
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Stillbirth is a relatively common, but often random, occurrence. The mean stillbirth rate in the United States is approximately 1 in 115 births, which is roughly 26,000 stillbirths each year, or on an average one every 20 minutes. In Australia,[4] England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is approximately 1 in every 200 births, in Scotland 1 in 167. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth</a>
cJRFbZUaaa	Your tummy is more lax this time around thanks to your previous pregnancies, making you "show" more and sooner.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Well you do show earlier with each subsequent pregnancy. You're most likely just very bloated and perhaps you've been eating a bit more than you realize. It is possible that a twin's hiding but highly unlikely. Congrats on the baby ;) xx|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Don't worry. Your fine. My friend got huge early in her pregnancy too. And she gave birth to a healthy baby boy in April.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Seeing as you have already had 3children - you are more likely to show sooner.<br>  <br>  Sounds normal to me - i started to show almost overnight.
zwctZ812aa	It's crazy to me that some people don't just fall in love with being a mommy, but if that's her attitude then I at least commend her for knowing she should give her baby up for adoption.  Hopefully a great family will adopt that baby and give him/her a great life.  I feel sorry for her that she is so immature, but at least she is recognizing it.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	It's probably the best thing for the baby. It's far better for the child to be raised by someone that loves and cherishes it rather then a mother who knows she isn't ready and still has some growing up to do. No real good can come of a child being raised in an environment where it knows it isn't wanted and is seen as a burden. Yes it makes me sad but more for the woman giving up the child then for the child whose life is going to improve.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It happens everyday. At least give the girl credit for wanting to do the right thing with her baby and not leaving it in a dumpster somewhere or neglecting it.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	this is really sad. if she does this-> the baby is better off with a loving family. Who care about them.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|a8IRxC4raa	No, it wouldn't annoy me at all.  Given her priorities, she's making a smart decision.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I know a girl that has 3 kids she doesn't have custody of.  The first one she let the father have (As far as I know she doesn't see him at all).  Second one was given up for adoption at birth.  The third one she kept for a few months and then decided she would rather go out partying and gave it up for adoption too.<br>  As sad as it is to think of that poor baby being taken from the only family they know, they will probably be way better off with parents who really want them than a young mom who would rather party.  I hope the baby isn't too old though.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	No but my brother and his gf had their son at that age and my mom and her mom raise him. His parents see him maybe 3 times a week and even then it's for a couple of hours. He is 14 months old and an amazing little boy who I love very much but he misses his parents terribly and it is very sad to watch them party and sew their wild oats per-say and see the effect on him:( She would be doing the right thing every child deserves a dedicated parent(s).|`|7bdhpvc9aa	It hurts me too to know that she is an adult and isn't willing to put all her love and time into her child. It makes me said that she doesn't realize that the biggest blessing that has ever been given to her is her child :( <br>  <br>  I'm a mommy of an angel and I would do anything and everything to be able to hold my son right now. We made more memories in seven months with our son then most people put in an entire lifetime. He is our son, our baby I mean how couldn't we not love him so much. I just wish other people will just realize that babies are so special and deserved to be given all the love in the world.|`|rjVALevtaa	Molly is right, the baby is probably better off with someone else.<br>  <br>  That really does make me sad though. I can't believe any mother would want to give her child away! There is absolutely no excuse for that. That girl is going to hate herself for making this decision when she grows up!<br>  <br>  When I had my first son I was younger than her and yet somehow I managed.<br>  <br>  That doesn't just annoy me, that pisses me off.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	It's a sad situation that the babys Mother isn't taking full responsibility but it would be even worse if she decided to keep the baby in these circumstances. That baby is better off with loving parents who have been waiting so long for it.|`|lCbsCM6raa	That baby is probably better off with someone else.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	If that's how she feels, then I hope she does give the baby up.|`|AA12164862	it is sad..but if she doesn't want her baby there are other better parents out there.|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	Actually, I think that's probably not a bad idea. If she wants to go out and party, she's gonna be a shitty mother. We can say she should grow up and accept it, but chances are she won't. And that's more of a punishment to that baby than being adopted by a family who really wants a baby more than anything else. Ideal situation would be Mom has a complete change of heart, but realistically the 'best' option would be exactly what she wants to do: put her baby up for adoption so someone better suited and more deserving can love the child.|`|MPcKEdVQaa	hmm where is the father? y hasn't he stepped in to take responsibility? yes i feel sorry 4 the child,it actually makes me more so angry than upset that these teens are not using protection when they clearly are not ready to have children not to mention stds but thats a whole other debate... if she did not want it then y did she continue with the pregnancy? i dont believe in abortion unless its absolutely necessary but where do we draw the line, i mean is it fair to give the child a life of such instability? never truly feeling like they belong caus their own parents didn't want them, their own parent chose a life of partying over them, that is so pathetic, and the worst thing is that girl doesn't realise it now but she will have major regrets one day if she goes thru with it, i really really hope the father or grandparents or someone in the family can step in here|`|u6jP7BQNaa	If she cares more about partying then raising her child, be grateful she's doing the right thing.  Hope and pray a good family will adopt her.  But it is sad.  When my friend got pregnant at 19 she stepped up and took care of her child, while working full time and attending school.  Maybe she'll have a change of heart.|`|VlYMcVKlaa	i think that is stupid. if people think they are old enough to have unprotected sex, than better f..en take care of it. i dont like those people.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I'd rather her give that baby up for adoption than continually pawn him/her off(or worse, just leave the baby) to go party.<br>  <br>  Yes it's crappy when people have babies and they are not ready for the responsibility but at least she's making ONE right decision amongst bad ones, and that one being the most important one.

Assuming the items are worn at all, they were almost certainly only worn one or two times before the baby grew out of them.  And since you're supposed to wash everything before baby wears them, a whole lot of clothes are advertised as "used" even when they've never been worn.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Ebay has new with tags same as from the store. You can also try Walmart. Make sure they are flame resistant otherwise it doesn't matter how cheap they are they won't be worth it.

pXSKSS3daa	Is she breast or bottle fed?<br>  <br>  Formula fed babies can go a few days between bowel movements and typically constipation will look like tiny pebbles. Breast fed babies can go DAYS between bowel movements(I think the max is 10-14) and are rarely constipated.<br>  <br>  If you're wanting a more natural approach to it try a warm bath and massaging her belly. That will help her muscles relax a bit. A couple ounces of water may help as well.|`|IGwX328eaa	She doesn't sound constipated. it is normal for babies to go up to 5 days with out having a bowel movement<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.justmommies.com/articles/baby-poop.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.justmommies.com/articles/baby...</a>|`|791NVofcaa	She probably wasn't constipated. 7 days is usually the time frame that doctors look at to start treating constipation....so 3 days is nothing. My son would go a week to 10 days without pooping and he was just fine. Make sure you don't start solids too early as well. That can add to the problem. 6 months is a good time for that.|`|AAlB49iraa	it is sometimes ok for them to go 3-4 days without a movement. i have heard about the karo but it has never worked for us. we used a little of the baby prune apple juice although i can't say it really helped or not. she finally had a movement. you can also try warm baths 3-4 times a day and the last thing that actually did work but freaked me out a little. taking a rectal temperature. be sure to use some lubricant on the themometer. it sometimes stimulates the movement. it only needs to be inserted 1/2 inch or so. i know i know... but when they get into that shape... you'd do anything. my little girl still gets constipated all the time and eats a really healthy balanced diet. my son won't eat hardly anything and is as regular as mornin' prayers.....  :)

Get her a pad and get her to keep it in the wallet or the side zippered pocket. This way no one else should see it, which is why she probibly refuses to have one. <br>  <br>  And if all else fails and you get make her keep one, she will soon find out why it is so important to have one...|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Uhh maybe she just doesn't like tampons.

It's obvious she was neglectful to both children who have died.  She might even deserve a man-slaughter charge for this baby.  With children you can not take it seriously enough, there are no second chances.  However, I guess for her she will just have another one to replace this one (like she did the first baby she neglected).|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	First of all, what's the baby doing in the crevice of a couch? Second, 6 days after giving birth this chick drink half a liter of bicardi? what? take their son away from them, and tie both their tubes. end of story. <br>  <br>  <br>  poor baby(ies!). =(|`|dHfFqVqhaa	I couldn't watch the video because my speakers aren't working.It's sounds sad though.Nature allows people to have kids but it doesn't make them parents.This lady shouldn't be allowed to keep future children which she'll probably have.|`|72503439fe4df370517dbeaf85497f3eaa	Sorry I did not watch your video.  I cannot stomach seeing or reading about any violence towards babies and children.  Anyone who hurts a child should be shot themselves.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	the bay had blood on her nose and lips? that wasn't a sids or suffocation from the couch soudnds like something done on purpose. where was this man while all this happened?|`|XOtOMncwaa	I strongly believe that with kids you should only get one chance... if you screw it up then you should be forced to have a hysterectomy or a vasectomy. It makes me sick to see people who have harmed their children and even killed some of them only to announce they are pregnant again.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I didn't watch the video, but I'm guessing it's the same story I read in the newspaper yesterday-A woman left her baby on the couch, etc., 2nd baby in a couple of years, etc. Sorry, I'm trying to not be graphic incase someone doesn't want to know what happened. <br>  <br>  I think what happened is insane. I wouldn't be surprised if it came out the woman had intentionally done something to her babies. She should be charged with their deaths and court ordered to not have kids.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	OMG that is horrible. I can see an accident happening once, yes but twice! that is just plain wrong! how could she drink with her newborn around? newborns need you full attention. that is truly sad and yes she should be prosecuted for neglect because that is exactly what she did and twice now! obviously she is not a parent who cares about her children becasue if she did she would not have drank a half liter of bacardi with a newborn around that needs to be taken care of.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	That has to be the worst thing I've heard in a long time. Why would a mom with a newborn drink half a liter? Especially with no one to watch or care for the baby? The father said they had just went through the same thing year ago. Now another baby dies. I don't know something really sounds fishy here. If she was and is the cause..then yes she should be prosecuted. I really dont see how this was an accident. I personally would never put my son AT any age in that sort of danger. We will have to see what happens. I feel very sorry for that families loss of this baby and the one already in heaven.|`|QxiNy647aa	that is awful and why was the baby asleep on the couch in the first place she should of had more responsibility if she knew she was drinking she should of got someone to take care of the baby
HEdGGmkhaa	I don't know how many weeks you are but it sounds like just pains to me, the baby is probably low and pushing in there.<br>  For me, contractions felt like waves of tightening that lasted about 20 seconds or less, then they get stronger and last longer, get closer together.<br>  You will just feel uncomfortable a bit, want to walk or rock when they get stronger. Trust me, you will know when it's time<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|x5aJcD9zaa	In my own personal experience, and the experience of several friends too, you will definitely know when you are having contractions.  <br>  <br>  My contractions were mainly in my lower back and lower abdomen.  They were waves of extreme tightening and felt like extremely bad period pains.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Time them, that is what I felt, and there was also tightening in my stomach. Now, before any of that my water broke but I was 1 week overdue. Good Luck if they are coming about 5-10 minutes apart keep track and go if your water breaks or the pain gets to bad.
aWkp6AJOaa	try drinking a big glass, about 32oz, of water, this is what they did with me & i wasted a lot of time in the l&d from false labor.  if it isn't true labor the contractions will stop.  if they keep coming you know you are in labor.  just keep busy & hopefully your labor will start to progress more.<br>  good luck & congrats!<br>  btw, i think if your contractions are about 5 minutes apart is when you call the dr & go to the er.|`|AA10953561	If they're under ten minutes apart, it's time to call your doctor, to at least give an update. If you're alone then I would call someone to come be with you in case you faint again. Depending on how far away you live from the hospital, you might consider going in just to get checked. You'd be better off going in and having it be a false alarm instead of waiting and having to call an ambulance.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5h8bYsKdaa	could be back labor. they say every 5 min go in but if you are really worried, then i'd call. better be safe than sorry! congrats, good luck
x5aJcD9zaa	I love my McClaren Quest stroller.  It is lightweight (5kg) and is easy to fold up and stow away.  It has a built it carry handle, and it is light enough to be easily carried on the bus.  It is great quality and I am really pleased I chose it.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.quinny.com/quinny/productdetail.aspx?id=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.quinny.com/quinny/productdeta...</a><br>  When my daughter was newborn, I had a Quinny Buzz stroller and basinette.  It folds up really small for a large buggy and when you unfold it, it does it itself.  It is so light and easy to manoevre, I'd recommend it to anyone.  :D  I will be using it when baby 2 pops out later this year.|`|a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Phil&Ted  <a href="http://www.philandteds.com/sport_index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.philandteds.com/sport_index.h...</a><br>  <br>   We love it. It has a reclining feature suitable for a newborn.  It has an optional detachable 2nd seat.   It's got a thinner design, I never get stuck between clothing racks at the store like my friend, lol!  Push of a button it folds up and snaps closed, so no worries of it coming open while loading or unloading it. And comes in many colors.  There are also many optional accessories made just for it, like drink holders, rain guards.  You can customize it how ever you want.  And it's good up to 55lbs!<br>  <br>  There is too many things great about it.  You must check out the sight. I fell in love and HAD to have one.
rFtKFp03aa	Start right away.. I started around 6 months and now my babies 9 1/2 months know lots of signs.. <br>  <br>  So my babes' favorite right now is "more" - they use this when they are eating finger foods mostly.. <br>  <br>  I taught them by saying more more, showing them the sign, saying more, doing the sign for them with their hands (or best way possible) and saying more then giving them more and saying good job here is more (whatever you having more of) we did major repetition but they catch on :) <br>  <br>  best wishes|`|zxNEewYzaa	Good Question.|`|b6arzStYaa	I am currently doing so, we started but weren't too (what's the word, i cant think of it) we weren't concerned about doing it every time we loked at him. But we did do the signs alot. We started when he came home from the hospital. Now he is 5.5 months old, and we are really working on it. he doesn't sign back yet.<br>  <br>  We are doing the signs for eat, change (for diaper change) and more.|`|791NVofcaa	The Signing Time series. Start with baby signing time ...It's AWESOME. I started it with my son at 15 months and he knows all sorts of signs now at 18 months. Make sure you are using the signs during your daily routines as well. Consistency works the best.|`|0oHakDnKaa	I took a baby signs class and they say to start it right away, right from day one.  They pick it up.  I work at a daycare and its amazing how young they pick it up.|`|9MVJmuNUaa	from day one or asap thats how they yearn to talk so signing is just a second language right get a book thats how i taught my babies and it worked great good luck now im sure ull do just fine
lISrOzyraa	I don't hate her, that's a good question though. I always wondered why people dog this woman for non intentionally wanting to have 6 or 8 kids. God gave her those kids and I'm sure she loves them. Instead of making fun of her they should help her. Like they do when everyone else has a lot of kids and they come out on the news too. You don't see people making fun of them.. why? cause they have money? cause they live alone? and cause they are married? people should not judge others. In my eyes you should put yourself in her position-would you want someone to take away your newborn babies you had? I don't think so! she didn't do anything I think that is wrong. And now the doctor is getting blamed for it. Yea people pay that man when they are in desperate need cause they can't have children. It's not like he provided these services for free and it was an experiment. No one should judge only god can do that!!! Help the woman don't criticize her because she has a lot of kids. Deer gosh if you can't help leave her alone she did not make this decision as far as her having so many kids. In the news I see her holding her babies and caring for them like a mother should. She didn't pop them out and just disappear she stayed and is trying to make a living. I have 2 kids and it would be terrible if someone would take them away from me-we caring American people should help this woman not take her babies away from her. WTF!!! it's ridiculous how they're treating her. She does not have a good home for them kids, well give her one, she don't have a job, then give her one. And she has no help and negative comments and negative people do not help in a situation like hers. I can go on and on but the truth of the matter is, she is suffering and needs help why separate her children from her? kids need their mothers like you and I needed ours when we were growing up. I don't think she's a bad person but I do think she needs a lot of help, help we can provide...it's not fair to do that to her I can see if this woman was a drug addict or a prostitute! but she's not!|`|6ri7AYC1aa	I don't think it matters how many kids she has. The Duggars have 18 kids and people like them. It's the fact that she had the doctor implant 8 embryos knowing that she couldn't financially support them. Also she doesn't have enough room in her mom's house for 8 more kids. <br>  People are also upset with the doctor for implanting the 8 embryos in her. The doctor knew that she couldn't support her kids. Even if she could support them 8 embryos is alot. Most doctor implant 2 or 3 maybe 4. <br>  <br>  I don't hate her. I just think she's irresponsible and annoying.|`|x5aJcD9zaa	I think people aren't keen on her because of her irresponsibility.  It's ok to have kids if you can support them fully and give them the basic essentials (ie: food, clean clothes, a roof over their heads, etc...)  <br>  <br>  What this woman chose to do is irresponsible beyond belief.  What is more irresponsible is the doctor who agreed to this process in the very beginning.<br>  <br>  I just wish the best to the children in all of this.  They are the ones who are going to be scrutinised by the public simply for being born.|`|8vTpcyPOaa	Because she is not in any position to have kids, let alone 14. Children are a huge responsibility and I think she has them frivolously. Maybe she doesn't understand the seriousness in her situation, but others do, and that's why they might be annoyed by her actions. If you go to her site why is the only link that works asking for donations. She has very little information or pictures or anything on there. She is acting like a charity case and wants us to pay for her actions, but she knew what she was getting into  by getting pregnant regardless of how many kids she thought she would end up with so I have no sympathy or desire to help her.|`|U5TDVhBFaa	if she had a job and provided for herself and kids-I highly doubt alot of people would despise her. but she is a burden on society-living off our taxpayer money,then decided to become a bigger burden ,and not only that- she cannot provide adequate support/safe environment-which is a form of neglect/abuse-since she chose to do this. <br>  <br>  if she was married and did this-people would hate both of the loser parents, if they were both financially responsible- people wouldn't hate her,and comapnies like gerber and pampers would have given her free products,more people would try to help/donate|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I think it's jealousy and all that publicity she's getting. Long as she is doing right by her kids it shouldn't matter how many foodstamps or whatever that she's getting. She is getting help. And god will guide her through. And hopefully she can get a house and her and her kids can be comfortable.|`|YX4y4vCfaa	People tend to hate anyone they can. It's the life blood of the developed world. You don't have to worry about your next meal or weather or not america is going to bomb your schools and hospitals in the morning so there's nothing better to do.|`|A5i2eSy9aa	one because she can't even support her six kids and she went and got and had eight more planning on only having one and two she is crazy because she just wants to have the kids so she can get unconditional love|`|jJiMSuHBaa	Well shes sucking the nations money down the drain, and selfishly got plastic surgery so i dint she can get laid and have more kids. She should be a super villain in a comic book!|`|9bG4PRRUaa	she cant support them<br>  she had them implanted purposely<br>  she is milking this for all she can to get money<br>  shes lost her children before<br>  she shouldnt have 14 if she cant watch over 1|`|79Qtlxi9aa	If she did all that stuff, no people wouldn't hate her. But I mean fourteen kids IS sort of over the top. I mean it really is.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	I think people don't like her because she has showed her low class by making poor decisions.|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	maybe because she's completely insane, selfish, and unfit to be the mother of 1 child, nevermind 14?|`|1WFJsAZUaa	well she was going to be in a porno had like 14 little kids and is just so interesting.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	yes and yes|`|3SP3KX24aa	because she can't provide the fullest to each and every kid i guess|`|wI5bhnuBaa	No and I don't have a problem with her having kids for the octuplets, if you can support your family, your a-ok.<br>  It's not just octomom with me, I am a man of principle.  I despise every mom that has more kids than she can support.  Bottom line.  I doubly hate her cause she wants taxpayers to pay for her, another set of people I despise.|`|PHknlA1Zaa	she didn't have a need to have all the embryos in at once and is a leach. She doesn't see the kids she already has as 6 blessings and i feel sorry for them.|`|6a9e556d0cd8ece39237ab847321c9f1aa	Yeah-social stigma is totally against single moms (the ones who can't support themselves) and child neglect and dependence on the state.|`|yP53nCPqaa	YES YOURE RIGHT ABOUT BOTH, PEOPLE GET MAD BECAUSE WERE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO PAY HIGHER TAXES TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN THAT SHE HAD IRRESPONSIBLY AS IS NOW USING TO GAIN FAME|`|GTMq1nxEaa	yes that is why i hate octomom. who needs that many kids? and who the hell does she expect to pay for them|`|V17liBvXaa	oh man you will get a lot of answers...SHES A BI***! And neglects her children! All she does is have them..you know she wont raise them right|`|vQhI79WRaa	idk, sucks to be her i guess...|`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't hate her, I think she has made some really poor decisions and that is going to affect those poor little babies.<br>  <br>  It just baffles me that she already had six children she wasn't properly caring for. Why on earth did she think it was okay to have more? Everyone knows with invitro you run the risk of multiples.<br>  <br>  I don't care how many children you have as long as YOU(not the government, not taxpayers, not endorsements from the media) can financially and emotionally care for them. She cannot do this.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Because she is IRRESPONSIBLE!!<br>  <br>  I hope the state takes those kids away from her...Those kids aren't gonna have A LIFE if they stay. How are even half those kids gonna get through college if there mother doesn't even have a job?? It's just selfish.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	People would be less likely to hate her.<br>  <br>  She's a single mom with 14 kids.<br>  She brought the 8 kids upon herself, even though she probably couldn't afford to give them all a good life.<br>  If you KNOW you can't do that, you shouldn't be having more kids. :/|`|OI3bf4yjaa	You pretty much just answered your own question. It would be different if she could actually SUPPORT her kids.|`|lCbsCM6raa	Holy, nobody at all is sticking up for this stupid woman. I guess it's unanimous, she's a piece of crap!|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Yeah, I think you pretty much covered it.|`|VjkDIvezaa	I don't think she is trying to get a show with the kids. I think she has psychological problems where she needs love from somewhere and she thinks she'd get it with more babies. They are worried for the kids. The kids have to grow up  without a father because she is single and very young, without a home because the mother is still living with her parents, without money for clothes and food because the mother doesn't work.|`|mnsN5iYGaa	I don't think people hate her, they just dislike what she's done. She's a "new era" mom; a mom that isn't accepted in this society because she has different principles that society don't accept. I think nobody is perfect and now that she has those kids, we as a "good" society should make sure that those kids grow up and become professionals and not prostitutes and thugs (I have nothing against prostitutes and thugs, though).|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Its the fact that she had 6 kids before that. Has no job. Lives with her parents. Is out spending money on crap ( a WII and was at the MAC store ). I don't know how she is going to give all those little babies the attention that they need. No one will give her a show. No If she did everything that she was supposed to like you said above then I wouldn't hate her so much. I think the doctor who did this should be stripped of his license.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	because she is stupid, most of her kids are Bastards(retarded)<br>  but the new never report that, those kids are living in horrible conditions.<br>  Off of food stamps, no father figure, her house is a pigsty<br>  most of her kids wont live to be 5 if she continues the way that she is.<br>  plus she is trying to become a celebrity because of that.<br>  *Grabs bible*|`|rVsW4ESTaa	I was in the salon tonight and this was the topic of conversation.  Wow, people are mad.<br>  <br>  It's the fact that she has no way to support them.  Nor can she care for them herself.  Plus it's those injected lips.  Euww!|`|cjaphGaoaa	She had 8 kids implanted in her when she knew that she couldn't support them. Now she's making sob stories about it.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	No, people can't stand her because she had all these kids that she can't take care of.|`|p9r6sKx2aa	Because shes just plain stupid
5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	In 1999 a Malaysian mother gave birth to nine living babies, officially the most babies in one birth..  Sadly, none of the 5 boys and 4 girls survived beyond 6 hours.  An earlier nonutuplet pregnancy in Australia had resulted in two still borns.  Six babies died shortly after birth. One baby, a boy, survived for 6 days.  <br>  <br>  The world record for a natural pregnancy (without fertility treatment) is held by an Argentinean woman, who was pregnant with 12 babies.  Unfortunately, the pregnancy was lost before any of the babies were viable.<br>  The official record for the most babies in a pregnancy (although not the most babies in one birth) was set in 1971, when an Italian woman on fertility treatment conceived 15 babies.  None of the 10 girls or 5 boys survived to birth.|`|lCbsCM6raa	I also hate octomom. Sorry this is not answering your question, but I just felt I had to add in my 2 cents. I can't believe someone would be so irresponsible and selfish to bring another 8 little lives into the world when she has absolutely no resources to look after them, or the children she already has. What a loser!|`|Kj9GWZI7aa	No, another woman in texas had octuplets before, but unfortunately one passed away shortly after birth.<br>  <br>  That many babies at one time is not natural.<br>  <br>  Human beings are not designed to have litters of babies.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	There was a set of 8 before her so she was not the first. <br>  <br>  I HATE octo mom.|`|ko3Larigaa	uhm if you mean by them all living I think someones had 9 babies that have all lived<br>  <br>  but there was 10 babies born at once but i think one died or a few died
sRy2SKpXaa	Yes! That actually happened to me last night while I was laying in bed. I was rubbing my belly and all of a sudden on the side of it I felt this lump, not sure if it was a hand/foot/head, lol. But it definitely creeped me out. And it hasn't happened since. It's totally normal, because the baby's getting cramped in there and needs to move and roll around to get comfy, so sometimes you're bound to see/feel a foot or hand or head.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	At your stage of pregnancy the baby still has alot of room to move around, i think what you are experiencing is perfectly normal. Good luck..|`|87efbc1abffab5d9e4de0d2caf80d4a5aa	VERY normal!!!!!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It's normal for your belly to change shapes as you progress. It is usually just because the baby has changed positions.|`|1o820L3Daa	Yeah thats normal. When Im sitting down I can actually see my baby move across my stomach. I woke up a few days ago and noticed my bump was alot lower than usual. Went to the docs today and I was told he has got head first into my pelvis already, which is normal apparently.
y8d38Sbgaa	Your baby is getting all the nutrition she needs from formula or breast milk until 12 months old.  At that point, she will actually need the calories from food to help her grow so I wouldn't worry about when she eats and when she doesn't just yet.<br>  I hope this is helpful.<br>  Lisa<br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a>|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	Hmm... I would say give her what she wants and enjoys at that age. My daughter is 7 months and pretty much hates all solids, sometimes enjoys stage one or two fruits, but otherwise will hardly touch stage 2 anything, stage 1 veggies, meats, or cereal by itself. feeding isn't fun, but i figure that eventually she will eat solids but isn't ready yet.|`|LTTips1vaa	Just hold off until they seem ready.  If shes cutting a tooth it might just be painful to eat.  Plus add on a cold (which decreases anyones taste for food or want for food).  Basically she will get to it but just give her time.  <br>  <br>  Try wetting a washcloth with water and then freezing it. Then let here suck and chew on it to numb up her gums.  My kids loved the frozen washcloth.|`|AA10096586	Don't worry my 8 month old doesn't want his food either. He wants to eat my food more then  his. If he is really hungry he will eat it. Are you ging your baby any finger foods? Try banana's, peas, and anything eles that is really soft. Just cut it up really small.|`|0qfT1eNfaa	If you are giving her a drink before she eats, then she won't eat much.  If she is teething that may have a lot to do with it.|`|ebJ02QZJaa	I'd say cutting a tooth and getting a cold is probably the reason she's not eating as much as normal.  Let her go back to stage 2 or cream of wheat or rice cereal for a few days.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	I don't know what number each food is, because we don't use that system over here. It's sensible to avoid the common allergens, other than that, feed her whatever she wants or you have in the cupboard as long as it is healthy. Teething often suppresses their appetite as does a cold. Don't worry, they have their funny phases just like we do.
ZZzQLjaKaa	My MIL does something similar...every single time she does, I say, well thank goodness it is not a race! I have also been heard saying, well thank goodness we are all made different, or wouldnt it be boring if we were all exactly the same. She hears these things so much from me that she knows what to do (stop). I try to say it calmly and with a smile, even though I am seething. It works though, I know how annoying it can be. Good luck to you!|`|If6Rv9Yvaa	dont worry about it. my sis has 2 kids.  her first son was talking by the age of 12 or 13 months, but her younger son is `5 months and is not interested in talking.  he just points.  its not a race and dont worry about it. your child will talk.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	ask them politely to stop that you and your husband and your pediatrician are happy with the way your baby is developing and that you don't compare children's accomplishments because it just isn't right and the baby knows he is in a way being criticized and they would like if you would compare them to all of your friends parents in their ability, accomplishments, and how they are developing as grandparents tell them that you welcome positive reinforcement<br>  remember to be nice and casual|`|RfxyVIh4aa	Just smile and agree with her.<br>  <br>  She's a grandmother.  She's the MIL.  There's nothing you are going to do or say that's going to change her.  So you need to change yourself.  Quit letting her get to you!  Stop being defensive.  Don't argue with her.  If she says that water is dry, grass is blue, and the sky is green - just smile and thank her for providing the information.  You already know that you are not wrong about your child's development and you are not going to convince her that she's wrong.  Just let it roll off of your back.|`|3zzvDf2Zaa	**** that *****. your son will be fine. most parents think their babies are super smart. stick to your parenting style and dont let other peoples babies affect yours. einstein didnt talk until he was 4 and couldnt read until he was 7|`|sjWogaDAaa	Baby talking at 11 months, haaaa... I never heard a baby talk at that age.  Your baby is babbling, be proud.  This MIL is obviously bothering you and she is crossing some major boundaries.  You really need to have a talk with your husband about this, and he needs to let her know what she is doing.  Can't she just love her grandson  without stupid comments and comparisons?|`|rFtKFp03aa	Ugh I know exactly what you mean.. I have 9 1/2 month old triplets.. and all they do that is the same is eat at the same time.. People are constantly saying, oh those two are sitting up and the other isn't, there must be something wrong.. or that one is bigger than the other two he might be prone to obesity or something else stupid like that.. <br>  <br>  It gets pretty annoying.. I have told people they are all different as you and I, if you have a problem you could just not come over anymore.. I haven't heard to many more stupid comments... It just gets annoying ... But just tell her.. you don't want your son growing up thinking his less than his cousin because she was able to drive at 16 and he is 15 yrs old and 9 months and still just has his learners permit... Some MIL are so hard to take sometimes..|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I think they do it kind of out of being worried - like omg he's not talking, teach him to talk, you should read to him more, blah blah blah.  just say yes, will do.  and that should shhh them.  it's very annoying, i know, but i do think its meant in a nice way - as odd as that seems.  the other thing i do is say 'you do it next time we see you'.  that one also works :)
gRZT4pnUaa	You could Very well be pregnant. You can still have a period. I had mine for 3 days one month then didn't have one after. Are you trying to get pregnant? Take a hpt.|`|HLKb961Qaa	You certainly could be! Some women get a period-like bleeding around the time of implantation, which is totally normal. It's time to go to your doctor and get some blood testing done. Good luck!|`|GOt88pwIaa	could you have mistaken implation bleeding for your period?|`|436fREgIaa	sounds like an off cycle period or you are pregnant.its hard to tell.this exact same thing happened to me for 2 months,even with pink colored,and not red..and i turned out not to be.then a month after that, i was.and the only thing i seen for implantation bleeding,was 1 pink spot on toilet paper 1 afternoon.3 weeks later,still having my chest feel like they were going to pop off..i took a test and was positive.the only thing you can do is wait.pms,and pregnancy mimick eachother in the first 3 months of pregnancy as well.its all a waiting game.take a test.if its neg,and your still unsure,wait a few days..test again.if your chest is still on fire,go to an ob.gyn for a blood test.best wishes.|`|DgXmTJzYaa	I suppose you could be. I am kind of asking the same question. my period was 2 days and 2 of spotting. Good luck!
1tM9MFJnaa	I am so glad you asked this I am 30 weeks and have been experience the same concerns. My doctor said that some times we just can't feel the baby move because it is in a different position.<br>  <br>  They also said that at 30 weeks the baby moves 30 times an hour and that I should feel at least 15-20 movements in 2 hours....which never happens!<br>  <br>  I am confident that every thing is fine, If you are still concerned just go into your docs and they will take the heart beat!|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	Fetuses, like newborns, have interludes of deep sleep. This means that there'll be times during the day when you'll feel little — or no — movement at all.  And that's okay.  As long as you feel something going on the next day everything should be okay.  I know that it's hard to not worry....i've been there myself, but don't stress yourself out over it though.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I agree with your doctor. The baby is still pretty small so you might not feel her all the time. At about 28 weeks they'll make you start doing kick counts.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Your baby is still tiny, so you wont feel all her movements.<br>  <br>  Try lying done, drink a glass of cold water or juice. If you are being active, you will probably not feel her.<br>  <br>  She may have also moved into a position where you cant feel her.
PUdWfF0yaa	Not the best idea. In the first tri-mester, there are risks, so why would you add to it? And in the second and third, I would think you would feel very uncomfortable. Good Luck|`|FIphLGroaa	That sounds like a bad idea.|`|9BwY5sA5aa	i dont think so.. it dont even sound like a good idea

Now that I have my son I can honestly say that there isn't much that could make me throw up, I think I've seen it all!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Nothing really. I have a strong stomach. Though when I was pregnant that was a different story.<br>  <br>  The only thing that makes me throw up is the flu or a stomach ache.
AiJeS6I1aa	There's a definite genetic component to quality of eyesight, but remember, the baby will have the father's genes in it too.  If they baby can see well right now, then great.  Eyesight can get worse with age.  In fact, it gets worse with age in almost every person... just how bad is a factor of genetics and environment.<br>  <br>  Have your baby see an ophthalmologist.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My dad is legally blind, but can see with glasses.  Not sure what his numbers are, but he's been that bad since he was a teen, and worn glasses since he was a kid.<br>  <br>  My mom didn't need glasses until middle age, she needs reading glasses so she's err... near-sighted?<br>  <br>  I had better than 20/20 vision as a teen (which is normal) but now hubby and I both have the same thing.  We can see anything monitor distance or closer *lol* and both need glasses to drive or see very far at all.  They say its from computer use, who knows?  But I'm a programmer and he's an audio engineer (all done on computers)<br>  <br>  Lots of things can effect eye sight, and of course genes.  All you can do is see an eye doctor.  Here they recommend an eye exam at 1 year and 3 years, but they say a family doctor can do it.  I see no reason not to go to an optometrist/ophthalmologist/whatever.|`|lCbsCM6raa	My optometrist recommended bringing my baby in for her first eye exam at 6 months. Maybe bring yours in if you are worried.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	My son is a 7 month preemie too!  :)  He's a little weed as well.<br>  <br>  If you son is spoon eating rice cereal well no choking or diarrhea.  Then it should be ok to move to Stage one foods.  I would stay away from apple sauce(makes sweet tooths) and carrots(hard to digest may cause diarrhea), at least until they've been eating for awhile.  <br>  <br>  We start with Gerber squash, but I've started making my own baby food.  I bake the veggie or fruit until soft then mush it up.  My son LOVES it!  Baked sweet potato is his fave.<br>  <br>  I would stick with the rice cereal once a day, we have it for breakfast.  It contains iron and other good stuff.  Then add a second meal of a veggie at night, for dinner.  He should still have a bottle. Example:  My son eats 8oz bottle.  For solid "meals" I usually feed 2oz of food and a 6oz bottle.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I had a 31 weeker and I never took in to account his corrected age for things like that. I gave him baby food when I wanted to. I started with apple sauce. I wasn't told until later that I was supposed to start with the "orange veggies" I.E: carrots, sweet potatoes....<br>  <br>  Go ahead and give it to him. He should be fine. The fruit is actually easier on his little belly then the harsher cereal.<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|VYpVrPluaa	i dont know if it matters that he was a preemie but im pretty sure babies should be started on the vegetables before the fruits.|`|U5TDVhBFaa	ask your pediatrician, he should be able to eat, but not Gerber. my friend is a pediatrician and she advices all parents to buy organic baby food or steam/boil organic veggies and mash them up yourself. she states Gerber is full of pesticides,and while most of our food is tainted with toxins ,in one way or another- babies -from birth to age five need to have toxin free diets-cause these pesticides/hormones adversely affect their nervous system,eyes, etc-which are still developing|`|3gdLRGzWaa	You can start him on it.

But he was a boy and they shaved his head...as for your daughter uh oh guess you will just have to get her a hair cut tomorrow maybe they can fix it, the bangs I think that will just have to grow out. Believe me she wont do it again bc kids will ask her what happend to her hair. Good luck|`|gs2aPltGaa	my sons did it!!!! i dont have daughters, i have sons, and they gave each other haircuts. although it wasnt as dramatic bc the norm for boys is short hair, I did have to shave their head because of it.<br>  <br>  all in all.... everybodys child does it god bless their little souls!!!

He was so embarassed, but he never did it again :)|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Well, its over and there is nothing you can do about it.  Alot of kids do it, its not the end of the world.

You will laugh about it one day.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I know they were naughty, but if it's any consolation...Every kid does this in their lifetime.  I cut my hair, my kids, too.  It's normal.

WvWFmwQoaa	yes they are bh and yes bh contractions can hurt mine do sometimes and they stay there for a while too. Allot of people will say that bh doesn't hurt but i have had some that do hurt its nothing to worry about but you should still mention this to your doc/mid-wife just to be sure that that's all they are remember we are all different and even tho you may have the same ting as someone else your could still mean different things. good luck and congrats on the bub :))|`|MSIf48X7aa	If it concerns you, you should seek medical care (go see your doctor).

AA12355507	Hi.... i am a mother of 3 and this is what i have been advised to do.... alternate tylenol and motrin.  If you give him tylenol at 12 give him motrin at 3.... tylenol at 6, pretty much every 3 hours.  If it does not get better in 3-5 days have him checked out, it could be an ear infection, sometimes you get the symptoms before any infection can be seen.  Also do not have him sweat it out and do not give him a cold bath.  Keep him comfortable.  Also make sure he is drinking and eating enough... they can get dehydrated quickly, also try popsicles.  I hope that this has helped... best of luck to you and your baby!|`|Z59g4JSCaa	I'm just the man to come to ma...I work in Pediatrics and yeah the doctor's right, theres nothing he can do for a fever....but what you need to do, is give your baby motrin, in four hours, give him tylenol...and rotate both every four hours...he'll be comfortable and fine...any other questions, email me joshuah0225@yahoo.com|`|i2Ytn70Yaa	Put light clothes<br>  no blankets<br>  a cold compress over his forehead<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't do anything to make him feel hot|`|E7tpMkdDaa	This one is weak, get another.|`|e7a42e7459777cd4908b6932136dba99aa	very strange, because my doctor never suggests Motrin, usually it's Tylenol. Or at least do both, give Motrin, and in 4-6 hours give Tylenol. Also, get 4-5 cups of taped water, put approx. 2 tbl spoon of vinegar in it, and cloth. Wet the cloth in water/ vinegar mix, squeeze out the water and place it on you babies forehead and wrists. It will get the temperature to go down real fast! <br>  <br>  And of course the "jewish penicillin"-  chicken soup! <br>  Good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t082100.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t082100...</a><br>  GETTING THROUGH THE NIGHT<br>  <br>      * First step – decide if the fever warrants treatment as discussed above.<br>      * Medications<br>            o Acetaminophen– this fever reducer/pain reliever has been around a long time and is effective is most cases. It can be given every 4 hours. Click on it for dosing chart.<br>            o New research in 2001 has shown that giving an initial double dose of acetaminophen for high fevers is both safe and more effective to bring down that high fever fast. Only give a double dose if the fever is high. You can only give a double dose once every few days if needed. Any other doses should be the regular dose.<br>            o Ibuprofen– this newer medication is also effective for fever and pain. It often works better for higher fevers, and lasts longer too. It can be given every 6 hours. It was previously only approved for children 6 months and older. Recently it was approved safe and effective for infants down to two months of age. Click on it for dosing chart.<br>            o Using both medications – it is best to only use one of these two medications. However, if one by itself isn't enough or wears off too soon, then it is safe to give the other medication on top of the first without waiting. Another option is to alternate between them every 3 hours. Give acetaminophen at 8:00, ibuprofen at 11:00, acetaminophen at 2:00 and so on.<br>            o WARNING – don't give ASPIRIN to children 12 and under. <br>      * Vomiting - if your child is vomiting and won't keep down any medication, you can use acetaminophen suppositories available over the counter. Click here for the acetaminophen dosing chart.<br>      * Lukewarm bath and cool washcloth – this can help get a fever down fast, especially if it is high, but only use along with, not instead of fever lowing medication.<br>      * Cool liquids to drink can help cool down a fever and keep your child well hydrated. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_832.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_832.html</a><br>  A fever does not necessarily need to be treated. If a child is playful and comfortable, drinking plenty of fluids, and able to sleep, fever treatment is not likely to be helpful. Steps should be taken to lower a fever if the child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dehydrated, or having difficulty sleeping. The goal is to bring the temperature between about 100 and 102 degrees F -- not to eliminate the fever.<br>  <br>  When trying to reduce a fever, first remove excess clothing or blankets. The environment should be comfortably cool (one layer of light weight clothing, and one lightweight blanket to sleep). Two medicines are useful for reducing fever in children: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Children's Advil or Motrin). Acetaminophen is given every 4-6 hours, and works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Don't use under three months of age without first having the child examined by a physician. Ibuprofen is given every 6-8 hours, and helps fight the inflammation at the source of the fever. It is not approved for children under 6 months. Both medicines may be given for stubborn fevers, but be very careful about using the correct dose of each.<br>  <br>  A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a febrile child (after medication is given -- otherwise the temperature bounces right back up). Cold baths or alcohol rubs cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Give him a luke warm bath and keep him in a tshirt. That should bring down his fever as well as keep him cool. I did this with my daughter last night. I also gave her some ice cream.
30883ff483f22f53beffad5289158812aa	Some people say that stray dogs harbor evil spirits. But, I don't believe it. I saw a little stray puppy just this morning. He was so fluffy and soft. As I looked at him I started to feel a sense of brotherhood I had never known. Stray dogs aren't the devil. Why they're every last bit as wholesome as you or me.

My daughter also started doing better at nap time too with CIO.  I know it hard in the beginning but luckily it usually only takes about a week or so for her to get used to it and start going to bed with out crying.

My son was in bed with us (breastfed also) until he was close to a year old. What worked for us was allowing him to fall asleep in our bed and then we moved him into the crib. If he woke up at night I would let him cry for a minute or two (or 5). If he continued I would go in a rock him until he seemed content or sleepy. Just keep at it and know that you are doing your best. It's natural to feel guilty...so those are healthy feelings. You guys will find the routine and you won't even remember this time!|`|B1JFBV3jaa	This is a tough one for me to answer.  I am TOTALLY against CIO.  Although I know she has to learn to comfort herself, I think that you should rock her or do something to try to help her go to sleep rather than just putting her in her crib while she is wide awake.  I'm sure you feel bad because you realize that if you hadn't let her co-sleep with you from the beginning, this wouldn't be a problem now.  But since it is a problem and it is obviously upsetting her (because she is acting different the next morning), I would suggest comforting her to sleep.  She doesn't understand why one night she is in bed with you and her dad and the next she is lying in bed, crying until she goes to sleep.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	hmmm- it's up to you. i personally don't agree with it. my son is 23 months and has never cried that long a day in his life. i too breastfed and co-slept- still nurse him. never bothered me. he also went through stages of getting up and not going to bed and it was tiring since i had to wake up at 5 am to get ready for work. if you're sad then don't do it. sometimes i had to go out in the other room so my fiance could get more sleep|`|rFtKFp03aa	It is hard at first.. but your baby is truly a happier and healthier baby getting a good full nights rest.. and Doctor will tell you how important sleep is.. <br>  <br>  I say give it two more nights and she will start crying less and less you will se.. not because she gives up hope, but because she is learning to self soothe herself to sleep.. <br>  <br>  Also make sure you are doing the same thing during the day... if you rock them to sleep during the day and expect her to cry it out at night it is confusing..|`|mFC2RBL3aa	I am currently going through this and it is also breaking my heart. My daughter is 15 months and she just wanted to play after going to bed around 10pm and it was, because she hardly wanted to take a nap in the daytime. Now she is getting in the routine of taking a nap in the day time then she is tired again around 10pm.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	it was ok when she would go back to sleep but since she is getting up and playing then put her in her own crib to sleep and just let her cry it out, she will fall asleep eventualy.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Work on those daytime naps.  I know it's hard to believe, but the better they sleep during the day, the better they sleep at night.  If takes a short nap and still seems tired, try nursing her back down and even holding her for part of the nap if necessary.  She should still be taking two naps a day at this age.<br>  <br>  Also, night waking like that often happens right before a big milestone, so maybe she's just about to crawl or say her first word or start pulling up or who knows what?<br>  <br>  Hang in there!  My guess is that this is just a phase, and it will be over before you know it.  In the meantime, do whatever works.  Oh, and if you don't like CIO, don't do it.  I promise you that you won't be nursing her to sleep by the time she heads off to college.  ;-)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its just a phase, kids have off days or weeks.  I've been known to just let my baby play himself out while I doze on the couch -whatever you have to do so everyone stays sane.  Usually its only one or two nights that the pattern is totally off.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sleep%20stuff.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...</a><br>  Older infants get up at night, but less often, and it is normal for one year olds to not be sleeping through the night.  Of course, if I did my job earlier, you now understand that nobody sleeps through the night.  Interesting tidbit: about 80% of parents of one year olds identify their children as having "sleep problems."  Eighty percent?  Maybe we have an expectation for our children that is not based on human physiology and is therefore not realistic. Maybe they don't really have a sleep problem.<br>  <br>  How 'bout this idea that we have to teach our kids to "soothe" themselves?  I would argue that a several month old child is still not able to feed themselves, find food, or do any other thing that it would take to live independently.  Why on Earth would they need to soothe themselves?  They are speaking up because they need something.  If they need something, even if it just to feel safe, why shouldn't we help them? Do we really need to teach a 2 month old independence?  Why should they do it by themselves?   Because we want to sleep...I understand that... but sometimes our needs aren't what our kids are considering.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/ap/sleep.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/a...</a><br>  Their babies tend to breastfeed for more than one year and they don't sleep through the night any better than most of us would if we napped and cuddled within inches of the best restaurant in town and knew it was open 24 hours a day.<br>  <br>  This arrangement is not just adequate and tolerable, but actually feels easier to moms who can just roll over, nurse a while and fall back to sleep with their babies rather having to get out of bed to nurse or, alternatively, refuse to nurse and get their babies back to sleep some other way.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  I don't recommend any forced sleep changes during the first year of life. Probably the only exception to this would be an emergency involving a nursing mom's health. There are many suggestions in books and magazines for pushing "sleeping through the night" during a baby's early months or during the first year. I don't think this is the best thing to do and I am quite sure that the earlier a baby gets "non-response" from parents, the more likely he is to close down at least a little.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sleep%20stuff.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...</a><br>  How come my friend's baby sleeps through the night?<br>  <br>  I don't know.  I don't even know what that means. When I ask about what that means, I get a great variety of answers.  Some people think 6 hours of sleep at night is "through the night" other people want to sleep like they did before they had kids.<br>  <br>  I would guess that the kids aren't sleeping through the night, but that the implications of admitting that your kid isn't sleeping are too nasty to admit.  We equate "good sleepers" with good kids, and "bad sleepers" with bad kids.  Really, we make moral implications from normal baby behaviors. And of course, parents of good sleepers are good parents.  And since 80% of us have kids with "sleep problems," 80% of us are bad parents.  Yipes. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200...</a><br>  NIGHTTIME PARENTING LESSON #4:<br>  An important fact for you to remember is that your baby's sleep habits are more a reflection of your baby's temperament rather than your style of nighttime parenting. And keep in mind that other parents usually exaggerate how long their baby sleeps, as if this were a badge of good parenting, which it isn't. It's not your fault baby wakes up.<br>  <br>  8. Babies still wake up. When babies mature into these adult-like sleep patterns varies among babies. Yet, even though babies achieve this sleep maturity some time during the last half of the first year, many still wake up. The reason? Painful stimuli, such as colds and teething pain, become more frequent. Major developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking, drive babies to "practice" their new developmental skills in their sleep. Then between one and two years of age, when baby begins to sleep through the above-mentioned wake-up stimuli, other causes of nightwaking occur, such as separation anxiety and nightmares. <br>  <br>  <br>  Rethinking "Healthy" Infant Sleep<a href="http://www.naturalchild.com/james_mckenna/rethinking.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalchild.com/james_mckenn...</a><br>  <br>  Myth: Good Babies Sleep Through<br>  <a href="http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/myths/restless.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/myths/restless....</a><br>  <br>  Sleeping through the Night<br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepthrough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...</a><br>  <br>  Why babies should never sleep alone: A review<br>  of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS,<br>  bedsharing and breast feeding<br>  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/articles/McKenna_why%20babies%20should%20n.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/articles...</a><br>  <br>  Slumber's Unexplored Landscape References<br>  People in traditional societies sleep in eye-opening ways<br>  <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc99/9_25_99/bob2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc99/9_25...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0071381392.php?nid=386&isbn=0071381392" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...</a><br>  Fourteen years ago, when my first child, Angela, was a baby, I faced your dilemma: She did not sleep through the night. On the contrary, she woke every two hours for my attention. As a new, inexperienced parent, I searched for solutions in books, articles, and conversations with other parents.<br>  <br>  I soon discovered two schools of thought when it comes to babies and sleep:<br>  <br>  1.       One side advocates letting a baby cry until she learns to fall asleep on her own.<br>  <br>  2.       The other side says that it is a parent's job to nurture the baby — all day and all night — and eventually, when your baby is ready, she will sleep through the night. <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, the two methods can be summed up as “cry it out” or “live with it.” I wanted neither. I knew there had to be a kinder way, a road somewhere between nighttime neglect and daytime exhaustion that would be nurturing for my baby and for me. <br>  <br>  Those many years ago, I felt guilty and selfish when I began to wish for an uninterrupted night's sleep. To reconcile my own instincts regarding Angela's nighttime needs with the fatigue that hampered my daytime parenting was nearly impossible. Time passed, and eventually my daughter did sleep through the night — but not until after her second birthday.  <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  You can sleep, too<br>  <br>  There are no good reasons for you to live as a sleep-deprived martyr. There are ways to get your baby to sleep without resorting to all-night cry-a-thons.<br>  <br>  In summary, I don't believe babies should be left alone to cry themselves to sleep. Or even left to cry as you pop in every 10 minutes to murmur comforting words without reaching out to touch him. But I also know that you can — gently and lovingly — help your baby to sleep peacefully all night long. So give The No-Cry Sleep Solution a try, and plan on seeing some wonderful sleep results

After I vomited for the fifth time I decided it was time to take a test and what do ya know! A big surprise for me and my husband :^)|`|aPscVrOoaa	I actually just thought I was about to start my period. I was a little achy in my back but that was it. When my period was a day late, I knew that was weird for my body so I took the test and it was positive. The first three months were really easy for me (I know so many women are cursing me because morning sickness can be rough!) But I really only experienced bigger breasts, and they were very very very sore, especially the nipples. Now I'm 6 months and tired as heck all the time!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I really didn't have signs that were different than my menstral signs. Tender breasts and the like, all normal. I did get an outbreak of zits.<br>  <br>  My pregnancy symtoms started in week 8 and I already knew I was pregnant by then.
Y9mew1mwaa	You will probably start to feel some bh contractions at some point. For me it started off feeling as if someone was squeezing your tummy really hard, and when you put your hand on your belly you can feel the tightness on your skin. One night i was having bh as usual, they are usually only slightly uncomfortable, when one hit me that took my breath away and when i stood up to walk it off my water broke ( although i assumed i had peed my pants) It wasn't until about a half hour later when i started to move around more because i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable that i realized that my water had broken. I went to the hospital and about 12 hours later had my son.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	I'm 37 and a half weeks and havent had any either. My dr said it's tottaly fine.|`|D3RCNSGiaa	You will know, I know that doesn't sound reassuring.  Your "motherly instincts" start when labor does...you WILL know.  It hurts, it's intermittent, and your stomach gets as hard as a rock.
AA10333342	That is a good age to start babysitting some good things are painting or any kind of art kids love it and reading to them is always good  and can put music on let the kid dance or take them to the park the trick is to keep them busy that way they act out and be mischievous hope this helps you out|`|ITCknAHVaa	If you are having trouble with your 2 year old brother, then no do not get into babysitting business.  Try taking some time and growing up first.  With your 2 year old brother, at that age like to be very active, take him for a short walk, go to the park.  Play lego, cars, painting etc.<br>  <br>  Little children are all very trying and wearing and I am glad you are starting to realise how hard the work is.  Do not babysit yet as you are way too young.  Instead, help out at home with younger brother, help out family friends and cousins with younger children.
o7E59VYZaa	yup she's kicking and doing back flips lol im 7 months and can't wait for my little june bug:)|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Nah shes not kicking but shes making a mess on the floor!!<br>  <br>  Shes 10.5 months|`|DYJOpfvraa	My baby is also kicking as I type.

I'm 22 weeks.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	yes im a little over 17 weeks|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Mines kicking away in her crib. She should be going to bed but the time change has her alittle out of whack.

JnWzHVnEaa	sometimes.  Not usually.  But sometimes.   Then the pill either doesn't work, works by not having the appropriate mucus to allow the sperm to swim to the egg, or prevents implantation of the embryo.<br>  <br>  With the lower dose progesterone only pills, ovulation occurs ~ %50 of the time.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	No you don't ovulate while on birth control pills that is why you do not get pregnant. The pills stop you from ovulating.|`|mL07N3IAaa	don't  listen to rachael. you do ovulate when you're on your pills! there is 7 "fake pills" called the placebo pills that you take at the end of the month and that's when you have your period!
seU9VwIJaa	I thought I was going to have a natural birth at first because I am TERRIFIED of needles and was afraid of the horror stories you hear about. It turned out that I couldn't handle the pain and begged for the epidural. My doctors were great and everything went smoothly. I asked when the needle was going in WAY after it was already in! They ended up turning off my epidural because I wasn't pushing as hard as I needed to, but I still couldn't feel a thing. I delivered at 8:58 a.m. and I was taking a bath by 11 a.m. I know that I'll do it again because I'm way too big of a pansy to deal with that pain!<br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i like the name<br>  <br>   pro= less pain<br>   cons= higher chance for c-section, can slow down labor, side effects like back pain headache and what not even after you deliver for a long time<br>  <br>   i had done and won't get another one. i went in at 6 cm and it took me another 19 hours later for him to come. and it made me shiver and feel sick- no back pain though|`|5h8bYsKdaa	i think its a cute name.<br>  <br>  natural labor is extremely painful in your stomach, back, and vagina<br>  the recovery from natural is better, i took a shower 2 hrs after giving birth<br>  with natural, you hate eve for eating an apple lol<br>  <br>  with the epidural, its harder to push sometimes, you cant walk, and its way less painful for your stomach and vagina.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	It's a cute name, not one I would personally choose. And you can spell it Mackenzie.<br>  <br>  Secondly I would NEVER get an epidural. Lately all i've been hearing from people I know is horror stories about how they got every "rare" complication that they say almost never happens with the epidural. I had my 3 year old when I was 16 totally naturally and I intent to have this baby that way as well. I wouldn't risk my health or my child's for some pain relief, screw that!|`|htBHCNDtaa	The pro of having an epidural is that it hurts less when you're in labor but it's actually healthier to give birth the natural way without the epidural, can't remember why but some medical show said it's healthier for the baby.
ngkNaQJeaa	It is wrong, because it is murder.<br>  if you get pregnant, it is your responsibility to give birth, and there is an option of adoption, there is no good reason to have an abortion.<br>  besides kids are awesome! <br>  if women are afraid of the pain, it is just temporary and you will have so much support as you go through it, birth is beautiful|`|OTZ8999aaa	I think its up to the mother. If your raped abortion is a yes. If you feel it is in the best interest for you and the child because of money, living situation, relationship, etc I think its ok. However if you are continually having unprotected sex and getting pregnant you need to learn. Some people don't learn and depend on abortion because they are too lazy to buy a condom or birth control. I'm pro choice, but do worry about the side effects from abortion.|`|PHknlA1Zaa	i think it is just in certain occasions,if the mother is unfit,is abusing drugs and alcohol. Really thats when it should be done. There is adoption,but if the mom can't keep her **** together and is drinking,she should have an abortion because shes just going to bring in a child with a shitty life in and out of foster care and chances are grow up to be a criminal.|`|tMeN2fm0aa	I think that its a womans choice and I will not make that decision for her.  I know what I would either do, or not do.. but that is MY decision, and no one can change my mind on that.  I am not PRO ABORTION as some Pro Life extremists like to say... I am Pro Choice.  You dont pay these womens bills, and you are not going to raise, and financially and physically take care of the child, so you shouldnt have a say so on what the mother does with it! (General Statement.  Not meaning YOU as the asker of this question or anyone reading this... just a general you)|`|V9ERr9A6aa	Getting pregnant is a blessing.  There are so many people in the world who want to have children and cannot.  I don't believe in abortion but will support decisions of what any mother would want and will express my feelings on such a situation.  Ultimately, it is the mothers decision but have persuaded 2 people in my life not to have abortions.  I now am a Godmother to a 15 year old girl and Godmother to a baby on the way!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I disagree with it in all cases except those of rape, the health of the mother, or extreme deformities/disabilities in the fetus.|`|FiOaEFuOaa	I think it should be illegal cuz your killing a kid a baby who should grow its really sad that people do that
lgIl0WgOaa	o ya def sounds like it... usually when kids start teething thats what they do... and they can start teething but the first tooth or set of teeth dont pop out for a couple weeks,even months.. mine started teething at 3 months but her first 2 came out at 5 months... and after that there was not stopping her.. she's at 16 teeth at a year and 3 months.. :) good luck and just be patient..|`|GKGvRuHzaa	My little girl also same like that, she always want to bit anything because she feel itchy in her teeth...normaly it happened when her teeth first grow. Now my daughter have 10 teeth.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	is he drooling like a rabid monkey? irritable or more fussy? is he chewing your knuckle in the same area of his mouth every time? have you felt his gums to see if there is an area that feels swollen or different from the area around it?|`|EHkVVpfvaa	My son cuts his first two teeth the day before he turned 5 months.  He had the same symptoms you are decribing for the few days before the cut through.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Usually when the baby is left in their crib on their back for long periods of time their head will flatten or Positional Plagiocephaly.  The lack of interaction may mean that her mom doesn't interact with her or leaves her in her crib.  At one year old I do think there should be more response to other people.  My 7 month old gives kisses and hugs, and interacts with people.<br>  <br>  She may need early childhood intervention.  Most states have government paid programs to help with children's developmental issues, like developmental delays or autism.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can suggest seeing an early childhood intervention program.  Or if you this the child is in danger you can report to CPS anonymously.|`|3zzvDf2Zaa	Wow this is serious, if no one else has heard the baby speak or make noises(the mother could be in denial) you should really get the mother to have her checked out.|`|AA12045643	she's freaking one relax|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	maybe they will have another kid and use them as book ends|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I  dont think her lack of speech is because of the flat head.  I would be concerned, mainly of the creepy look (i get it)  Does she make eye contact, play, laugh.  What other things does she do, or not do?
aPscVrOoaa	Every pregnancy symptom is different for individual women. I never got morning sickness, but my boobs hurt like heck! Now I'm in the third trimester and I don't have heartburn, which most women do. Everyone's body is different.|`|OxxrqzCzaa	When I was pregnant, I didn't get morning sickness, heartburn OR tender breasts.

EHkVVpfvaa	I think as long as your baby has no problems on either formula you should be fine.|`|a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Similac is not as fine of powder as Enfamil.  Alot of babies have gas from Similac. <br>  <br>  They are equal in nutritional value.  But it seems like Emfamil mixes better and settle better in the stomach. <br>  <br>  If your little one has a sensitive tummy I would stick to Enfamil and just stock up during sales.  Switching back and forth my cause gas, diarrhea, or constipation.
a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Do you have any of those "push toys", where the baby can grab onto a handle (like a stroller) and push it along?<br>  <br>  Kids will pick it up on their own, when they are ready.  My son learned to walk a few days after his 1st birthday.  He was cruising the furniture for months, but would never completely step away without sitting down.<br>  <br>  One evening, I turned around and he was taking his first steps toward me.<br>  <br>  The next morning, he was running.  And he refused to be put in a stroller forever.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I agree with the others answers, but if you want to help him the hold his hand and walk with him or get excited with him when he tries to walk, encourage him to pull himself up on the couch or something and walk along. Smile and encourage him with a toy or soemthing to try to walk to etc.|`|zUkaqbRDaa	Whats the rush? he will learn in his own time. walkers actually do more bad than good when it comes to learning to walk, the baby is not learning to balance and be patient, but to walk on his tippy toes and push his upper body forwards to get moving. do this exact same motion when NOT in a walker and the result? baby falls over! He needs time to strengthen his leg muscles and perfect his balance so no need to rush him!|`|iLLoc003aa	When you are playing with him on the floor, exercise his legs. When ever I played with mine or changed their diaper I would exercise their legs and sing the "I'm a maniac, I'm a maniac Yeah Yeah" lol They loved it, it was like a game to them. My oldest started walking at 10.5 months and my daughter who would repeat the song with me started walking at 9 months :) They are 4 and 2 now :)|`|lqlfIEjNaa	All babies develop at their own pace. When he is ready to walk, he will walk. He is almost a year you say, so there is no problem. Most babies learn to walk after their 1st birthday.
703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	My daughter ended up being nine days late.  I am so thankful I didn't go in for an induction; I feel I probably would've ended up with a c-section if I had.  42 weeks is still considered normal, so I wouldn't worry yet.  Have you tried having sex?  It's kind of awkward at this stage, but semen contains prostaglandins that can help ripen the cervix and bring on labor.  Also, breast pumping or manual nipple stimulation can release oxytocin--which is like pitocin, but better because it's the real thing.  If the baby's really not ready, though, these things won't magically work.  It may be that your babies just need a little longer.  40 weeks is a pretty arbitrary timeline anyway.  Good luck, I hope it happens for you soon!|`|S4Kj1cgOaa	I am also late!! Im sitting here at 40wks and 4 and have been more then over it!!! I too have tried everything from long walks... and I do mean long.... to castor oil!!! Nothing works!!! Im starting to think that if the baby or your bodies not ready then its just not going to happen!!! I wish you luck and hope ou can find something that works!|`|53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	hey dear..i hear yaa...i turned 40 weeks today and i dont have anything going on with this baby that would predict that it would be coming anytime soon.i had my membranes sweep on friday and had false labour all weekend which had put me into great physical and mental stress.i actually didnt sleep 3 nites in a row thinking that i might be going into labour anytime soon. today i went to see my doctor and he told me he will see me on friday and give me an induction date for next week coz i dont think i will have this baby on my own. so i will be pretty much 41 weeks and 2-3 days when i have this baby..i am 3cm dilated and 100% effaced with a soft cervix though and that was on saturday. i tried walking, sex, spicy food and everything else i can think of besides castor oil.. but nothing has worked... i think there is very little one can do to start something which will happen on its own.i had my first son on my own on the next day of his due date.. my doctor today said that no one can predict labour... and i think he is right..i have been more disappointed then anyone i know coz i actually had false labour.. anywayz...take care and dont worry too much... things will happen when they are suppose to.. enjoy the last few days of doing nothing and waiting around.|`|CFFuFof1aa	OMG, I feel for you hunny. I've never known anyone to go over 42 weeks. I guess the baby will come when he is ready. You may have to be induced. My daughter was induced and everything went perfect. Are you dilated or effaced any?? Bless your heart. Don't do the castor oil. I threatened to take that and my doctor told me that it will only make me have diarhea. It might be your best bet to be induced. If that baby gets too big you may have to have a c-section. There is no way you will be able to push it out. I suggest you being induced.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Well everyone on here is so hell bent against castor oil(even if they have never used it) that their gonna tell you don't do it. Then tell u some gawd awful story. I know plenty of people who have used it(1 being myself) who did not get horrible diarrhea vomiting, or they baby pooped it's self while it was still inside of mom. Castor oil only works if baby is ready to come. If you use too much then you get those horrible side affects. If you use too little then nothing wil l happen.<br>  <br>  I used it twice. With my now very healthy 3yr old. And my now very healthy 1 yr old. I had to run to the bathroom a few times to poo but who's to say that's from the castor oil and not from the baby moving down into the birth canal. Each time i used it I drank 2 medium size cups of castor oil and orange juice(half and half). And had my healthy baby 8 hours later drug,epi, and complication free.<br>  <br>  So for me it works. But again it's not for everybody. Each time I used it I was 39 wks.<br>  <br>  Just wana thank all you anti castor oil people for the thumbs down in advance!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!!!|`|Agw4pXAnaa	My mother had me on Dec 2 and I was suppose to be born on Nov 11.  I think walking works best than anything.  I had been shopping for gifts at the mall and Wal-Mart 2 days before my due date, I did alot of walking.  I got home about 7pm, cooked dinner and than went into labor at about midnight.  I would just suggest walking around your yard or a track.  Good luck!
b6EyFLgUaa	you can see if a fast food restrant is hireing but honestly with the economy it may be hard to find a job. other wise you can mow lawns, baby sit, do those kind of things.|`|NfW5GzESaa	just open wide and swallow|`|QONP634Kaa	well my daughter is 15 and I suggested she apply for Six Flags.  Not sure if you have one there.  Also try the movies, grocery store and ice cream parlors.|`|75bK7FE2aa	Be a stripper
RfxyVIh4aa	Just like you approached us for help.  <br>  <br>  Unless you married a complete and total insensitive jerk, I cannot imagine that he won't be moved by this.  Men in general like to be asked for their advice.  They like to be asked for their help.  But if you need him to do something specific, then tell him.  ("I think I might have post partum depression, could you please come with me to the doctor.)  I wouldn't recommend that you just cry on his shoulder and expect him to be sympathetic at this point because it sounds as though you guys probably have had a lot of back and forth bad/negative behavior.  But if you tell him that you think "X" is wrong, and you need his help?  If he loves you/cares about you, chivalry should kick in.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on baby number two.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Oh ((((hugs))))<br>  <br>  You need to tell him. Get a baby sitter for an hour and tell him I NEED to talk to you. I NEED you to listen and I NEED you to respond.<br>  <br>  Whatever your issues are he is still your husband.<br>  <br>  ((((hugs)))) again. I really hope you can find your answer. You'll be in my prayers tonight.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	First of all I am so very sorry for your situation, it must be hard, and even though I've never exprienced Marraige or having children (yet), there's still a part of me that sympathises with you and wants to help you.<br>  <br>  Because I don't know you or your husband (or your relationship) at all, my guess is that stress has caused a drift. It sounds as though he is mad at you for something, so you potantially need to sit down and talk rationally without the fighting.<br>  You could always write him a letter, explaining how you feel about him, if you still love him, let him know, write down happier memories that you have of both of you...I mean you must have married him for a good reason. Talk about your beautiful children, and all the things he has done for you that have been positive. This will also help you remember the better parts of your relationship and bring light to your life.<br>  Don't have anything about the depression in this letter, this is a positive letter, and it is not to have anything concerning that.<br>  Set a date and time to talk to him about your depression, explain how counselling is too far away and talk calmly about how you are feeling inside, ask him to do the same.<br>  Cook dinner for this occassion, make it as neutral and as stress free as possible, in no circumstances should you include wine or beer, as alcohol can trigger depression and anger.<br>  Start writing him love letters. Telling him what your thankful for about him. Tell him you love him (if you do) and tell him every day.<br>  As for your own healing, ask a family member or a friend if they could have the children for an hour or two a week, make this your personal time to relax. Have a bath with lit candles around it, have a lay down and read a book, or just lay down and clear your mind. Eventually this "me" time could potentially turn into "us" time with your husband, where you talk and cuddle on the couch or watch a movie.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and the best of luck for you. If you want your marraige to last, it will. Just look after yourself hun, because you deserve to be happy.|`|EHkVVpfvaa	If he wont listen to you write him a note.  You don't need him to go to the dr. with you to get a presrciption for your depression.  I gaurentee (even though I can't spell it) that your marriage will improve, even in the slightest once you are healthy and happy again.  best wishes|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I am so sorry you are in this situation.  If you think you are suffering PPD, you need to get help, for you and your children.  Just make a doctors appiontment and go!  You dont need your husband for that.  <br>  <br>  DONT make any long term decisions untill you have been to the doctors and are put on meds if needed.  If you are suffereing PPD, it could be the route of the problem with your husband.  When and if you are diagnosed, he may see things differently.<br>  <br>  For me, I find writing it out helps.  I have written my hubby letters in the past telling him my feelings.  It helped alot, i am not good with words or confrontaton so when i write something i get out what i want to say clearly and he gets it better.  I only do this when it is really serious and he doesnt "get it".<br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you....Get to the doctors..soon, they are the only ones that can help you if you do have ppd, I wish your hubby could understand what you are going through.  I had a bit of ppd, not enough for meds and it passed, my husband thought i was going off the deep end.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	I had postpartum really bad then I found out I could have called to delivering doc and they would have called in antidepressants for me. Sometimes your serotonin level drops low after a baby and you just need the meds to fill in for awhile til your brain can catch up. Don't be afraid to speak up to your husband, he should be able to be approached otherwise he must be the one with the problem and I can't blame you for being depressed. If you can try to take care of it with out his help,  not be too needy and just call your ob doc.|`|PTLXDmG4aa	ohh your poor thing.. i just don't think that men understand these things at all.. i would speak to your gp, and explain what is going on, see if she can give you anything to help you get back on track.. i think 3 months is a long time to be waiting|`|3zzvDf2Zaa	If your husband is brushing you off in your obvious time of need and comfort, you  dont need to keep trying, i would go with the part of you that wants to leave him. look for counseling for yourself .|`|MPcKEdVQaa	maybe you should be telling him this instead, the biggest and fastest way a marriage breaks down is lack of communication you don't need counselling at all you need to be talking to each other the only thing is do you both want it to work because if u don't, or he doesn't it wont work maybe you need to establish this and work from there, my hubby and i had our first child 7 months ago and i suffered a form of post natal depression and didn't speak to him for at least 4-5months but it was more me he was the one who wanted to talk i didn't and then he asked if i wanted it to work because if i didn't then how could it and it just sort of woke me up to reality and that alot of things were in my head...that's depression you see the bad side of everyone and everything u cant look at something and see the positives...so that's y u really need to talk...good luck
wCjjBdzUaa	everything <br>  <br>  Lots of yogurt with fruit<br>  <br>  triskets with cream cheese <br>  <br>  icetea|`|aPscVrOoaa	Definitely fruits and veggies, fresh is great but frozen is good too. Make sure you gets foods from all the food groups. Milk, yogurt, cheese, peanut butter (awesome for keeping you full and your blood sugar stable and gives you protein), nuts, lean meats, salmon, tuna, whole wheat breads and tortillas and crackers and cereals. Avoid empty calories like sodas and sugary junk food. Obviously, you'll want to eat some junk because it is sooo good, but limit yourself to one small treat a day. But I don't know if I'm one to talk cause I went to Coldstone for ice cream tonight!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Keep plenty of fresh fruit/veggies on hand.  It's easier to eat if it's convenient.<br>  <br>  Have a big o' bottle of water handy<br>  <br>  prepare meals beforehand so its grab and go, I know I don't like cooking for myself cos of the smells.  I like salmon, ground turkey, boneless skinless chicken with easy veggie sides.  I usually get the steam bags from the freezer to the microwave.  <br>  <br>  Bake yourself heatlhy muffins, low fat, high nutrition.<br>  <br>  Oatmeal, cereal with skim milk, or 2%|`|V9ERr9A6aa	You're sick b/c you're not eating enough.  Make sure and eat at least mini meals every 2-4 hours.  At night, you are not feeding the body so the baby is feeding off your nutrients thus leaving you feeling "morning sickness" when you wake.  If you wake up in the middle of the night, find a snack!|`|mn8tFuhoaa	try eating saltine crackers makes the morning sickeness go away!! and try eating a fruit cocktail is good for you..congratz!
044WNiRtaa	It's only been 5 days, you still have a bit of a wait before you can really find anything out.  It also seems a little early to be having "symptoms".  I think you should wait till your period is due next, and see what happens.  If you don't get it, take a test.  In the meantime get some rest.  Perhaps you've come down with something.|`|rVsW4ESTaa	Take a pregnancy test.  It's odd that you did not have a regular period.
168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	I hate the lines and colors and stuff. At Target when I did purchase (suprisingly cheaper there than at Wal-greens or Wal-Mart). I can get 2 pack for $9.99 of the ClearBlue Easy Digital.<br>  <br>  It says "PREGANT" if you're pregnant and takes very little wait time!|`|KlJHZRSiaa	Dollar Tree have the best kind -- called New Choice -- sensitive to 25mIU/hCG which is the same as the $12 kits, but for only $1|`|PUdWfF0yaa	To be honest, you can spend a fortune or not. I honestly went to the dollar store and got one and it worked fine, I even had money for two.lol  So it depends, do u want to spend alot?
IJhQ86djaa	idk i dont really like the name sladder. what would kids call him in school?? think about easier names for him when he gets older, like alex or john or something like that! be creative!!!|`|Wvcf4Nn5aa	????? 0.o|`|PHknlA1Zaa	like bladder? ehh i don't know about that it sounds dark and creepy i don't like it plus sounds like a name that could easily make fun of him.

Too many other things rhyme with Sladder (ladder, bladder, madder, etc) that are not very good to be called|`|P0oggVFQaa	I'm not a fan, perhaps spell it Slater, or it may be mispronounced "Slah-dur"|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	I don't think it's a HORRIBLE name, but I think it might get mispronounced a lot. (Think ladder with an 's' in front!) Slater might be better, so it's not always getting mispronounced. I don't see it as one that he would be teased for. Different, but not too far out there as some names today are.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	that is weird. I would not reccomend it, but i you like it, then go ahead!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Sladder is just awful, sorry sienna.<br>  <br>  My very best name is the one I gave to my son:  Joel (Jehovah is God) David (Beloved).

You need to be a good while before you start having sex.  <br>  <br>  Maybe he is just smart and cautious, does not want to be a teen age Dad and have to quit school to support a baby.  Don't push.<br>  <br>  Sex in and of itself is pretty blah for a girl at least at first.  Most girls jump into fast and are really disappointed.   Most teen girls wish they had waited a lot longer before becoming sexually active.  Sex for sex sake makes a girl feel cheap after while, most boys are not nearly experienced enough to make sex good for a girl.   That is why waiting will help, you will meet someone you do love, and want to share that part of you with,  it will be learning for both of you and special --not 'oh, I had better put out for him or he might leave me.  That is not love, that is sex.   <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend has it right.  Wait.

AXshzI0Kaa	Oh, this is really BAAAD!!!<br>  <br>  Since you cannot sign any relinquishment papers before giving birth......YOU MUST NOT FORGET, this baby is YOURS and the couple who wants your baby is BULLYING you. Tell them to not call you anymore and if you are unable to stand up to them (I understand...you are young and it takes big BRASS to do that), then ask your parents to tell them to not call you anymore. <br>  <br>  Pull your name from the agency and tell them "thanks but no thanks". <br>  <br>  YOU OWE THESE PEOPLE NOTHING!! If you are having second thoughts then you do not need to be making this decision now. <br>  <br>  It takes a lot of nerve for the adopting parents to belittle you by asking you how you are doing this to them. When they signed up with the agency, the agency should have educated them that this could happen...it is not a done deal until the judge says so. If you do not relinquish your baby to them, then someone else will. <br>  <br>  The couple HONEYMOONED you and when that seemed to not work anymore they began the GUILT trip. Just tell them to can it and go away. This baby is yours and you owe them NOTHING.<br>  <br>  Good for you on thinking this through. Whatever you decide, best wishes.<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  <br>  LuAnne, don't worry about the thumbs. There is a faction of folks here who prey upon the helpless. My "advice", like that above me is just that...advice. It is given to someone who is being seriously abused by the adoption industry...that would be you. It is these people who pump that very industry full of the unethical bias that keeps it alive and sullys it for everyone. <br>  <br>  YOU do what you want and on your time LuAnne. Remember, this is your baby girl and no one can take that away. You are her REAL mother and if she had a choice, she would like to have her REAL mother. She knows you best, she knew you first.

It is NOT selfish for you to raise your child - it's what your baby wants and needs - her mother - the one that gave birth to her.  These people are only being nice to you to get your child.  Please keep her.  There are programs out there to help you and you said that your parents will stand behind any decision you make!|`|2f49jsLpaa	You have not given birth yet, and at this point you have every right to "change your mind" and decide to parent your child. This is the big problem with "matching" with a family before you child is born, the adoptive parents are led to believe that this is already their baby, and the expectant mother is led to believe that she "owes" them the baby.<br>  <br>  My best advise would be to put your adoption plan on hold, and wait until you you give birth to make your final decision. If you really want to raise your baby and are commited to making all the sacrifices, and work hard to take care of your child, and make a good life for the two of you, then you should do so.<br>  <br>  To be honest, even if you do decide in the end on adoption, I would suggest choosing different adoptive parents. The way  that they are acting not only leads me to believe that they would break any open-adoption agreement that you have once the adoption is final, but also these probably aren't the type of parents you would want for your child. A lot of adoptive parents are not like the couple you described, but you need to be very weary of the ones who feel "entitled" to a baby they are matched with. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would immediately contact your social worker at the agency, have her tell the couple that you decided not to place the baby with them, and that you are going to take some time to think about what you want, and what's best for your baby, and once she is born, if you decide on adoption, then you will get back in touch with them to select new adoptive parents. If they are rude to you, or try to talk you in to staying with this couple, then you really shouldn't go through this agency anymore even if you decide on adoption.<br>  <br>  Good luck in making this decision, just make sure you are making it in the best interest of your child and not to please anyone else.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Do not have further contact with them.  They are only looking out for themselves.  If you want to parent, please do.  It is what is better for this child.  It is what is best for you as well.  There is no need for you and your child to be separated.  These people only want your child to become their own, which your child will never be.<br>  <br>  Don't talk to them.  Tell whoever you are working with that they have upset you.  Even if you choose adoption, they are not who your child is meant to be with.  A person with a kind heart isn't going to speak to you that way.  They are viewing you only as a vessel for their own purpose.  They should be out of your life.  <br>  <br>  I hope that you can keep your baby.  These lowlifes need to be reported immediately.  They have no business being around you or any children.  Do what you need to do to make yourself heard there, or another girl is going to be in your place with them.<br>  <br>  You are a strong girl for going through this all so far.  Do what you feel is right in taking care of these people.  Also, consider keeping that baby.  If your parents are going to support you, you both have a great chance at growing up happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Perhaps Birthfather in Hell is right in thinking the agency wouldn't do much.  There are other places that you can speak to.  Heck even the better business bureau or another government agency will listen.|`|N89HLv92aa	If you are haveing second thought then dont give up your child because you feel gilty.  They will get over it and find another child to adopt. But if you think this is going to be something you will regret then dont do it.  Because there is no going back after you sign those papers.  If your parents are willing to support you then you may want to try raising her yourself. A child is a gift from God. I can understand why the adoptive parents are upset because they probably cant have children and they have been waiting for this for a long time but you cant give up your child if you are having second thoughts. Pray to God that you make the right decision. Put your faith in him and you wont go wrong. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|w2NA1KuXaa	You owe this couple nothing.  Nada.  Your baby is yours.  You arent being selfish by considering parenting your own child.  THEY are being completely selfish, on top of immoral, unethical, and coercive.  I agree with others who have recommended that you cut contact with these people.  They will obviously go to any lengths necessary to get their hands on a baby, even if it means they need to browbeat and guilt you into it.  They are the kind of PAP that scare the crap out of me and should be considered unstable for what they are doing.  The agency is also not going to have an unbiased part in this, any counsellor through them will have the agency's best interests at heart, which is acquiring your baby for the PAP.  Someone unbiased and uninvolved with the agency would be your best shot.<br>  <br>  You have family backing you up, and there are plenty of resources out there to help you out.  I was a teen mom, its hard, but its doable, and so so very worth it.  If you want to raise your wee one, raise her.|`|9leE3pXaaa	Those people are ignorant, and only care about themselves, I want to adopt but understand that the best place for a child is with his/her own family, I'd be sad for my family if I were in their position but at the same time glad you are thinking about keeping your baby.<br>  Go for it, I know many teenagers that kept their babies and even though it is hard work, they are happy.<br>  Do what your heart tells you to do (hope it is to keep your baby)|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	If you do not want to give her up, don't. If you give her up and it's not what you want the decision will haunt you for the rest of your life. I can empathize with the perspective parents. I was a foster mom for 3 years. I know how badly they want your child to be theirs but the fact is she's your child. Talk to the agency. Back out of the adoption before it's too late. I know you feel guilty but right now your only focus should be you and your child. Good luck.|`|CWXNo3z5aa	The agency should not be allowing them to talk to you like that. I would not give these people your baby. You need to keep your baby or find a better agency!<br>  <br>  ETA: These people only see you as an incubator and not a human being. You are a means to an ends. They are using you. Don't let them do this to you! They don't care about you.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	If you want to keep your daughter then you have every right to do so.  What this couple is doing is wrong, coercive and they are the ones being selfish.  Personally I would be running 100 miles an hour in the opposite direction if I was you.    If you really want your daughter adopted then choose another couple who will be respectful towards you.|`|fMiLQnSJaa	Keep your baby.  These people have no right to be talking to you the way they are talking.  They are rude and pushy.  Seriously, stop talking to them.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	I didnt read all of the answers already here, so sorry if I repeat. The choice is YOURS. If you now want to keep your baby, definatley keep it. Its not a shirt that you can find somewhere else ifyou lose it. Dont fall into their pressure by giving her to them. I dont want to sound like the pushy couple, but it is very hard to go thru. I am almost 32, and have been trying to have a baby for almost 8 years now. We cant. We have tried adoption, only to have the birthmother change her mind. It is VERY stressful, you get so excited over the promise of a child, to have it taken away, jerked out of your hands without a SINGLE thing you can do. I would imagine its like being pregnant, wanting your baby, only to havea  miscarriage. Its very disheartening. So I can understand the couples feelings, a bit. I would not however, speak to anyone like that, as they should know, that its very possible for the birthmother to change her mind. As an adoptive parent in waiting, you have to not let yourself get excited until the baby is in your hands. DO NOT let them have your baby, if you really do want to keep her. Its up to you otherwise. I would speak with the agency and let them know what has happened, with this couple. And should you choose to to go ahead with adoption, let them know you want another couple. But make sure you make that decision with finality. Its not fair to promise a couple their dream, to then take it away. And also to you, if you indeed wish to keep your baby, do it without hesitation. Dont let a couple push you into giving her away. If you do keep her, raise her well with lots of love. Good luck to you, youll make the right choice Im sure!|`|TlFnIei0aa	If you want to keep your baby keep it otherwise you will regret it for the rest of your life.<br>  It's great you have your parents support.<br>  The agency would have explained to them that in alot of cases the birth mother changes her mind and ends up keeping the baby, i think its like 80% of the time or something but don't quote me.<br>  So you just have to be frank with them and tell them you've become too attached to it to give it up. Ofcourse there going to be upset but thats just part of it and unfortunatly it does happe. Dont let them make you feel guilty, I'm sure they will have the opportunity to addopt again.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, this is a very sensitive area, you are allowed to change your mind, perhaps its best that you don;t continue contact with them until you know what you want-as well your body is going through massive changes.  If you are having seconds thoughts now, it will be even harder when she is born.  Talk to your parents, if they are willing to help -you take it.  Its sounds as though you only rang the adoption agency because everyone else said you should.  You are not being selfish at all if you change your mind, don't be bullied.  My husband is nearly 40 and adopted, i asked his mum about his real birth mother, (only her age)- she got very shirty-her reply was-she was horrible-didn't want to hold the baby-not a very nice type.  I then asked- but how old was she. 15 was her reply.  what more can i say.  My husband doesn't know anthing about his biological mother nor did he know that, but since i've told him-he fully understands why he was adopted.<br>  So all i can say is talk to your parents, and perhaps some of the other people that others have recommended.|`|jQc3Y3Qtaa	one SIGN NOTHING. if your 17 and your parents support any decision you make and you want to keep the child. then keep it. of course these people say it would be selfish to keep the baby. they selfishly payed thousands of dollars to be this far along if this is through an agency. tell your parents you want to keep your child and tell them about the pushy attitude and comments of selfishness. if god truly wanted them to have a kid they wouldn't be trying to buy yours and bully you into it to boot. again sign nothing best of luck. <br>  <br>    do not take this to the counselors or anyone at the agency. they will act like its wrong and do the same thing. i dont care how much they seem to be there for you THEY ARE NOT. this is a sale to the agency nothing but business. the niceness will end as soon as you sign. talk to your parents. if the paps are this pushy now they are adopting for the wrong reasons|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Please keep her and don't let the couple make you feel bad,your baby needs you, not them. Don't let anyone bully you. Tell the agency you have changed your mind, the end. Don't let them bully you either. You are the mother.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	If you want to be a parent to this child, put your foot down now.  The would-be adoptive family KNOWS that you have a legal and moral right to change your mind and they SHOULD KNOW that what they are doing is awful!.  The child isn't "theirs" and they shouldn't act as if she already is!  They have no business trying to guilt you into giving them your baby.  If they really were thinking of the child, they would step back and give you your space to make a decision.  Again, this is nothing that they don't already know.  Adoption classes cover this for adoptive parents in detail.  They are choosing to act this way.  <br>  <br>  Since you asked for advice, I'll give my advice.  <br>  <br>  Do not speak to this couple.  You are under no obligation to give them your child.  You are under no obligation to make a decision about adoption before the child is born.  What this couple is doing is WRONG!  <br>  <br>  If the adoption agency calls you, tell them that you've changed your mind and want to parent your child.  If they try to keep calling you, don't talk to them.  You don't need their permission to parent your child!<br>  <br>  If your parents are supportive, great!  But there are lots of resources out there to help you parent your child.  Take advantage of them!  Being a teen mother is tough (I was one), but it's not impossible.  You won't be ruining your life, but you also need to know that it will take a lot of hard work and sacrifice.  There are plenty of young parents who are great parents.  If this is what you want to do, don't let anything stop you!

If she can drink 6 oz. every 3 hours, fine.<br>  <br>  There is no set amount that she should be taking in at each feed. However, at 5 months, the TOTAL amount/day ranges from 24-32 oz.

vygYFdsSaa	You could absolutely be pregnant. I got pregnant on the pill. Women get pregnant after missing one day of the pill. Did you read the directions? You are supposed to start a new pack and use back up protection if you miss that many pills. Your chances of pregnancy are good; the bleeding could be attributed to the fact that you were so irresponsible with taking the pill (it messes up your cycle when you do that...) Good luck|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Honny, if you had sex you could get pregnant, even if you are on birth control and never miss a pill, and use condoms, and the pull out method (which is not a form of birth control in any way shape of form) Dont have sex unless you want a baby<br>  <br>  sex=babies, not just unprotected but protected sex as well can get you pregnant|`|mL07N3IAaa	oh wow...you missed so many of your pills! it's not even effective anymore! lay off on the sex! use a condom if you missed your pills at least!! and taking the pills means you're going to be responsible for taking them around the same time everyday! don't take them and have sex if you're not gonna take them properly or seriously! and why not take your pills along with a meal that's the same time evreryday so you don't forget??|`|sRy2SKpXaa	First of all, they always tell you when you start taking birth control TO USE A BACKUP METHOD for one or two pill packs because it doesn't take affect right away. Second of all, anytime you have unprotected sex you run the risk of pregnancy. Third of all, you could really be pregnant if you missed a pill, and had unprotected sex, how old are you, seriously? Did you read the instructions for the birth control, or anything? If you aren't responsible enough to take your birth control properly and you ask Yahoo Answers for help, you shouldn't be having sex, bottom line.
h2DCW4k9aa	I didn't know this until a few months ago when some of my 'mommy friends' deceded to clue me in!  Apparently a 24Mo size is mainly intended for a child still in diapers, roomier butt and tops are still onsies for the most part.  A 2T doesn't have as much 'butt room' and is made just like normal clothing, no onsies, just regular shirts.  Hope that helps!|`|OHq5gSjJaa	In general a 24 month is for babies ages 18-24 months (approximately).  A 2t is for once the baby is 2 years old, a toddler.  So a 2t is a little bit larger.  It is mostly larger in the length as the baby at this age is starting to get leaner as well as not needing the diaper anymore, so the size kind of lengthens and thins out a little bit.|`|hpR1BOYjaa	Not much really in size, but more of the line and style.<br>  You will find that some places carry "lines" of clothing like Target carries Just for You and Walmart carries First Year and Gymboree will carry well, Gymboree.  So, those lines will have a certain design that goes from newborn - 24 months and a line that goes from 2T to 5T.  They generally different designs because stuff like one piece button outfits will look a little silly on a 2-3 year old.|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	To be honest- i think that the sizes are all nuts and it really depends on the baby's own size/shape, and the brand. some clothes of the same size would be different depending on the brand. a 2t in some may be bigger than 24 months in some, but smaller in others, you get it? the best way to know is to try it on!|`|a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	24m month is really 18-24m. <br>  <br>  2t is 24m and older.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel.

Yes, 24 months is two years old, but my son wore 24 month clothes at  year old. He's Two and half now and he's in 2-3T.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	A 2T is generally longer then a 24 months. With a dress it is usually about an inch, same with pants and shirts.|`|rjVALevtaa	It's the same thing. Why they label certain brands 24 months and others 2T I have no idea.|`|lCbsCM6raa	I think they are the same.
VR9KhbEgaa	I am currently 13 1/2 weeks pregnant with a Mirena in place that can not be removed! It is true that Mirena tricks your body into thinking it is pregnant and over time you can no longer even have a period. However, Mirena does NOT prevent an egg from attaching, only the Paraguard copper IUD does this! Wait at least 4 to 6 weeks before you can expect a proper result from a HPT or contact your doctor. My first urine test at the doctors office was negative, i went back in 4 weeks later and they did a sonogram and I was 8w4d pregnant, so the first test was not correct!|`|S5GP2nlUaa	I was on the mirena. My doctor told me that it tricks your body into thinking that it is already pregnant, and you will get pregnancy symptoms. However getting pregnant is next to nothing, because the Iud sticks to your inner uterus wall and once something is stuck to that wall your body wont let anything else attach...and egg. But if you still feel like that take a test to reassure yourself.|`|168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	Yes, apparently it is more common than previously thought by many. Unfortunately no birth control (except abstinence, but if that were practiced no need for "control", lol)...is 100%.

You can get them at the dollar store.  If you had sex a couple months ago and havent had a period then you are probably pregnant. Unless you usually dont have a period every month.

Good luck.|`|8sFWLyxKaa	Sounds like u could be especially if u have been missin ur period for a couple of months now|`|4JD3vavKaa	Tori???!!! Youre PREGNANT?!?!? WERE THRU
AiJeS6I1aa	Yes, yes, yes.<br>  <br>  Soaking in plain water will help with healing your wound/stitches.  Do this 2-3 times in a day for about 10 min each.  This is called a "sitz bath" and is recommended by doctors and other health professionals.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I like to think it's called a sitz bath because you "sitz" in it.  LOL|`|u6jP7BQNaa	When the stitches are removed or dissolved, and when the bleeding stops.|`|J4uWjrZwaa	well i had stitches and i was told not to get in the bath until healed. but like every night i would site in the tub with hot water that could stand and i put vinegar in the water. it really helped me heal and feel Better faster|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	Wait like to 2 weeks---honestly. I had stitches and my doc told me to wait 2 weeks.. Take sits baths where its just a little water so you're area is partially getting wet..like a inch of water. Just shower for now.|`|2lqcYOvpaa	I took a shower first, but, from what I remember, you can take a bath pretty soon, and it feels really good on your repaired area.
PgiZQZKxaa	i know it sounds cruel but let him cry it out no longer then like 10 -15 min it worked for my twins i tried everything and nothing worked so i finally had enough at 18 months and let them cry i know my kids so when one got to the point i thought he was going to get sick from crying to much i went in to his room and got him the next night they cried for about 10 min but then gave up and went to sleep i know it sounds cruel but you know your kids and you will know when to stop it it may take up to a week to work also try to make him stay up all day with no naps i know that its hard but he will be so tired will go to sleep sooner and then next day try only one nap my boys get up at 7 am then nap noon for 1-2 hrs bed at 8 pm every day no matter what and they are used to this and now they just go right to sleep no prob|`|EqVvNnCyaa	Milk and banana are a natural remedy to help him sleep. give him 1/2 a banana and a small glass of milk 5-10 minutes before bed. This should help settle him. If this is not working I suggest you visit your family doctor about it.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I would try to tire him out by playing with him a lot then try to get him down to one nap. Make him a heavy good meal thay would knock him out then that should help. I do breakfast lunch a snack then dinner for my son and he sleeps through the night and if he may wake up I give him his cup of water then he goes back to sleep.|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	Take him outside and let him get fresh air for a good half hour if its nice out then more. Give him a bath before bedtime and let him run around and get all that energy out. also, make sure you're feeding him solid foods for dinner as his stomach will stay fuller longer. GOOD LUCK!
o40QqoQGaa	no, the age of concent is 52 months apart. as long as you are no more than 52 months apart, then theres nothing to worry about.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	No, its only 2 years apart, but a 16 year old should not get a 14 year old pregnant, it may not be illegal but its sick on the 16 year old part to be interested in a little kid, because 14 is a little kid|`|7qVuZRHfaa	Their DAMN NEAR the same age!<br>  I dont think so!|`|hCfm9mxXaa	Um well neither of you are considered adults. So i don't think it is common. Think about it more and more teens are getting pregnant. You don't here drama in the news about teen lwasuits.|`|ko3Larigaa	I live in Ohio but Im guessing your age of consent is 16 too... <br>  <br>  so I think so But im looking it up now..<br>  <br>  From what I have read I think so but Im not sure how up to date these things are.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Mylicon.    It works wonders.  We give my son some.  Then a couple mins later he'll let out a "man burp".<br>  <br>  Are you making sure he gets a good burp after every meal?  Maybe try burping in the middle of feeding and after.<br>  <br>  It could also be a sign of reflux.  Not all relfuxes cause baby to trow up.  If he's refluxing from his intestine into his tummy he could have pains.
vygYFdsSaa	Hi sweetie, it sounds like you could be pregnant but your symptoms can be explained by many other things. If you have the time, go to the doctor and get a blood test for a definitive answer
HbQ5Cj6gaa	It could be gas. Try getting her to poop or fart some thing. Push her legs into her chest. And make it look like she is riding a bicycle|`|i7QJAgquaa	did you burp her hold her upright on your chest lean back a little so her back is not holding her wieght and pat her back gentle and see if she burps.if that doesn't work buy her  some gas medicine at wal mart or and grocery store i always buy the mylicion<br>  here's the medicines website<br>  ↓↓↓|`|72503439fe4df370517dbeaf85497f3eaa	Maybe the little one has gas?  You can call your pediatrician no matter what time it is.  They may be able to recommend something for the gas.  Mine recommended Mylicon drops.  It's gas medicine for babies and works wonders.  Even newbie newborns can use it cause it doesn't get absorbed.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	I might be gas, or should could be overstimulated.  Put her in a crib for a few minutes, with the lights down, and if she doesn't fall asleep it's gas.  Give her some Mycelion drops and she'll be asleep soon.|`|HzYPGgGjaa	babys is probaly just colictry a rocking chair or u can get one of those bears that make the sounds of the womb they seemed to help for my baby.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	You're doing nothing wrong. Some babies just cry. It might be colic though. But she might just be fussy/tired.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	this happened to me with my son when he was a few weeks old! I had no idea what was wrong with him, i thought he was sick then I called the nurse hotline and she suggested that I wrap him up in a blanket (swaddle him) to make him feel comfortable like he was  back in the womb and it worked. I swear to you it worked like a charm. I put him in a recieving blanket and wrapped him up nice and tight and held him and he was calm within mintues and back to sleep.<br>  <br>  I hope it helpes!|`|81bd6d1d0c0eef55c6c7c2a1f1f1a3ccaa	This is wind.  Put her on her tummy over your arm (the "colic hold").  Rub/pat her back.  This was about the only thing that used to soothe my daugher at that age.  Make sure she burps.  <br>  <br>  If this doesn't work, try another position (my daugher was also soothed well when held upright her stomach sitting on my shoulder).  <br>  <br>  Always do whatever you try until your daughter burps.  This is the main thing to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  I know how hard, and how heartbreaking it can be! Hang in there, and good luck!|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	Colicky?<br>  <br>  Call the doctor, but i'm sure they'll tell you that there's not too much to do. <br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  <br>  First of all- get to the doctor to make sure nothing else is wrong. <br>  <br>  If formula fed, try a sensitive version in case it's gas, which can be painful. <br>  Feed her sitting upright. <br>  Feed her smaller, more frequent bottles. <br>  Burp her really, really well. Like every ounce if you have to. <br>  Rub her belly. <br>  <br>  For colic- <br>  Soothing white noise type of sounds- washer, vacuum, singing, running water, soft music<br>  soothing motions- rocking, bouncing up and down, car rides, massage,  bicycling the legs<br>  swaddling<br>  carrying in a sling<br>  warm baths<br>  swinging<br>  lay her on her belly (this literally cured my daughter's fussing at night completely, went from sleep only a couple of 15 minute periods in between hours of screaming, to sleeping 8 or 9 hours straight)<br>  <br>  Basically just keep trying everything until something works. And if it doesn't, then keep the fact that it won't last more than three months in the back of your mind, and try to keep yourself calm and able to deal with the stress of a crying baby.|`|HRFaAyKOaa	I would try to feed her again - Just to rule out hunger as the issue. (Even though you already fed her). If she's not still hungry, and she's not running a fever, then it's safe to say it's probably gas.|`|AA12300309	Maybe she has colic- or possibly reflux. Check with her peditrician asap.|`|mn8tFuhoaa	don't worry you didn't do anything wrong.. maybe she just has gas..i know how it feels..
PUdWfF0yaa	It's your hormones. It sucks but it's the truth. I'm 12 weeks and my stress and anger has been kinda scary. I wouldn't want to deal with me at all. Just try taking deep breaths and counting 20 down to 0. Someone once told me 10 to 0, it didn't work for me, so I tried a higher number.  lol Also try a hot shower or a bath. Good Luck|`|mFC2RBL3aa	Yes it is bad, you shouldn't have any stress I was having stress and the Doctor told me I needed to m on bed rest for a few weeks, because I was having a threat of a miscarriage.|`|bEblcTmIaa	It's definitely not good.  Stress, even early on in the pregnancy, can in the worst case scenario cause miscarriage. BUT that is worst case scenario. Just try not to LET yourself get stressed.
dNlCfhD2aa	I don't understand what your future profession has to do with this.   Just b/c you are a teen parent doesn't mean you can't still go to college.  There are plenty of scholarships and grants for people in your situation.  <br>  You need to take responsibility for the decision you made and do the best  that you can with the situation.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	O so now you think that we are the dumb people, but you are the one that thinks because you are going to be a father that you have to give up on all your dreams. Really child you need to think about what you said. You can do anything that you put your mind too. And if school was so important to you then why even have sex in the first place. Save that until you are an adult and know that there is always a chance of getting a girl pregnant. Condom or not. The package that it comes in says this is 99.9% effective. But now that you are going to be a father then it means you are going to have to work so much harder at making your dreams a reality, not only for yourself but for your child.|`|AA10953561	You obviously recognize that being a parent is hard work, but that doesn't mean you have to put your dream of being a doctor away. It'll just take more work and it'll be hard, but don't give up your dream and goals. It's important to have an education, that way you can take care of your child later on. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QR6IHIZxaa	well i dont want to be another dumb person thats gonna give you all this **** about steppin up and be a man and blah blah blah because you know what you did and now you know that you have to deal with it, you should of thought about this the moment you realized the condom broke, you could have gotten the plan b' pill, but what was done is done so you just have to deal with it... anyways theres no advice i can give you other than just trying to make the best of this and you can still have a future with watever your trying to be. Hope all goes well.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	You made the choice to have sex, knowing the consequences.<br>  <br>  Step up to your responsiblities|`|436fREgIaa	step up to the plate and take a side job while you STILL GO to school.noone said stop living..they only say use your brains.help your girl,stay with her if you love her,and you just have to start your family earlier.dont pass up the opportunity of a lifetime.just be there as much as possible for her as well when not at school.life has given you a good smack in the face,now learn the lesson and look up to the positive things that can come from this.if you dwell on the negative aspects,that is what you will get.everyone alwaysssss has an opinion,unfortunatly.just show them the person you can be,and not the person they think you will now become.i hope your girl supports your dreams too.do all the reading you can on parenting as well.dr.spock  and what to expect when your expecting books are amazing even for daddy's. :) congrats on your new journey through life.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	Have you given any thought on how this will effect her life?  She probably had goals too.  Something to think about next time you have sex.  If you're meant to be a doctor you'll find a way.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	I think your being a bit selfish here...ya your dreams and stuff will be putt on hold as you need to get a job, but I think your not the only one giving up your life here. Your gf is going through a lot and needs your support also. I hate to hear that you think this baby is the end of your dreams..cuz its not..its just a delay..if you want to be a doctor, you definitly can..you just got to work that much harder, but its definitly possible. Your feelings are legit, and its alright to be dissapointed and upset. Respect your gf decision cuz it was a hard one. congrads on the new babe!
1SGl03Zlaa	Alcohol takes about 1 1/2 - 2hours per drink to be out of your system.  You don't not need to "pump and dump" after drinking unless you are worried about maintaining your supply (or just want to relieve full breasts).  As long as the alcohol is out of your system it will be out of your breast milk.<br>  The marijuana will stay in your system much longer though (weeks to months).  There isn't really much info on breastfeeding and marijuana use because there hasn't been many human studies on it.  Here are some websites with more info <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle/marijuana.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cfpc.ca/cfp/2005/mar/vol51-mar-clinical-1.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfpc.ca/cfp/2005/mar/vol51-ma...</a>|`|uGqYoZNEaa	WOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!  How about you don't breastfeed?  That way you can do whatever you want to your own body and the baby won't have to worry about drugs or alcohol in its body.<br>  <br>  If you wanna bf, you need to seriously think about is the drugs and drinking worth it.  I think THC stays in your system for weeks, so you'd have to throw away batches upon batches.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That said............i have held my judgment really well in check.  Ppl do everythin gin their power to do what's best for their babies and you are throwing it all down the drain.|`|Aud59N3Caa	are you serious? what are you 16? you shouldnt be smoking weed your a parent I wouldnt want to be your baby and have you come home and try to care for me. If your going to smoke weed dont bf at all!! poor child!!|`|03vbT9olaa	You have GOT to be kidding.  <br>  Poor kid.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	ok the drinking isn't too bad because if you wait an hour or two per drink then it's fine but smoking weed- that can take up to a month to get out of your sytem. pumping and dumping does not make a difference|`|7bdhpvc9aa	You are going to be judged since you asked. I would give anything and everything to be able to hold my son right now. He passed away at 7 months old due to Spinal Muscular Atrophy. I cherished every moment I had with him and thank God for every second. Please don't waste his/her childhood years drinking and partying while you could be making memories and giving your child lots of love. You have a beautiful blessing right in front of you & YOU NEED TO REALIZE THAT. Your  child is the most innocent thing. I hope you realize how much of a blessing your child is.
7bdhpvc9aa	Since he is turning 1 soon this must mean his Well Baby check up is coming up soon. This would be a great question to ask the doctor. <br>  <br>  I found this online so I hope it helps. Good Luck & God Bless<br>  <br>  Diet for One Year Old <br>  You can replace breast milk or formula milk with whole milk, after the child is one year old. However, do not resort to low fat or skim milk. It is not good for children, as they need fat for growth. <br>  Give your child fruits, vegetables and breads to ensure that he/she gets all nutrients. <br>  Grains and dairy products should also form a part of the diet of your one year old child. <br>  Feed your child 4 - 5 times a day, because toddlers cannot eat too much at one time. <br>  In case of new foods in the diet of the baby, add only one at a time and keep a check for any allergic reactions. <br>  Avoid foods such as nuts, popcorn, potato chips, corn, grapes, raisins, etc. These foods may choke the baby. <br>  Do not give sweets or sweetened beverages to the baby, as they contribute to tooth decay. <br>  Do not give soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate. <br>  Do not give any vitamin supplements to the baby, as a healthy child should get all its nutrient content from foods. Standard pediatric multi-vitamins may be given, if your pediatrician recommends it. <br>  Do not feed the baby solids in a bottle. <br>  Avoid giving milk or fruit juice in a bottle to the baby while he is lying in bed. This can develop nursing bottle mouth, which may result in tooth decay.|`|iWB8y1CGaa	He can eat table food, just cut it up into smaller pieces.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	He's at the age he can start eating adult food.  Green beans, soft carrots, mashed potatoes...etc.|`|E7tpMkdDaa	Steak.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	at his age he should be eating table food- he doesn't need teeth to chew my son also had donly 2 teeth at a year old. feed him meals with you adn some healthy snack in between.|`|IGwX328eaa	3 meals a day 2 or 3 snacks and should have milk or water with each meal. I find it easier to feed my son when i eat he eats. breakfast is at 8:00am lunch at 12:30 then dinner at 5:00pm snacks are usually between his meals
E7tpMkdDaa	Drugs, sex...both?|`|1k6UUC8qaa	sleepy time tea|`|EHkVVpfvaa	Set the thermostat to 55-65 F.  Take a warm bath with dim lights before bed.  The fast drop in your body temp fromk the bath to the cold bed physiologically helps release melatonin and seratonin (hormones/chemicals that regulate and cause sleep).|`|2Y9OnGnWaa	warm milk before sleeping..|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	a... baby?|`|uGqYoZNEaa	sex?
bGIKzvBEaa	late/missed period  is a good indication of pregnancy. personally i would get a blood test. because when i was pregnant i kept getting neg tests, so i went to the doctor for a blood test and i was 6 weeks pregnant. cramping along with no blood is a good sign.|`|mL07N3IAaa	go to the doctors and get a blood test if you're really worried! blood tests are the most accurate! and HPT aren't always accurate!
vygYFdsSaa	Yes those are signs. The fact that you've been trying for a year per se doesn't increase your chances, but it does help because it means you had unprotected sex hopefully on your most fertile days :) Good luck, you are late if you have a normal cycle so take a test and find out!!|`|aWkp6AJOaa	go get a test you should be far enough along to take it tonight.<br>  how exciting for you, i hope this is it!  i waited forever before i could get preggers.  i will keep my fingers crossed for you!  :)<br>  if you are watching your money the $1 ones at the dollar general & dollar trees are accurate.  i used plenty of them & if you are pregnant it will show up.|`|bGIKzvBEaa	peeing like crazy,missed period ,and headaches are signs! good luck!
3CVfUiiJaa	You just started your period...it happens to women every day.  Why would you think it is not normal to start your period?  Do you keep track of it and know when you are going to start?  If you have your period, no there isn't a chance you are pregnant.  Use condoms please...or just don't have sex.  You don't sound as if you are old enough for that anyway.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Contrary to popular belief, you CAN be pregnant and be on your period. Sounds to me like you either: A> just started your period. Or B> Your cherry was popped.<br>  <br>  There is ALWAYS a chance you can get pregnant if you're having sex. Even if you do use some form of birth control.<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|yKS2UI87aa	That probably was not your period but your hymen breaking. You can get pregnant at any time if you are not using protection

She shows everyone out there that having babies is great no matter what state you are in, to be irresponsibly bringing helpless children into this world without a hope in hell of being able to raise them the way they deserve.  Sure she's brilliant.|`|pXSKSS3daa	LOL. Please tell me this is all sarcasm.<br>  <br>  If not, get a new life plan. This one has(obviously) already been done and not too many people are keen on it.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	considering she used lies and trickery to get that fertility treatment, I do not think she is someone to idolize.<br>  I do not feel she should be trusted with the children either as there is extensive evidence of mental instability, I personally would not trust this nutcase with my children as I do not feel that she is a responsible enough adult.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	"and the fact that she refuses help.."<br>  <br>  Ummm... who is your source?

She's old news people. Time to talk about something else.|`|gRwYBmKQaa	you sound just as nuts as her!!|`|sAAnquoTaa	Are you kidding me? Hell no she's not my hero! I think she's a selfish dumbass that just wants attention.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	no i don't look up to her and you shouldn't either .sure i hope you  get the children you want.  I have three and believe me they are very expensive if you want to do it right.  they demand so much one on one attention that you really have to give.  I think she has a problem and she needs to be loved there is not doubt that she loves her children but she cant keep dumping them on grandma. you can have one hundred kids as long as you can afford them and have people to help them grow up like healthy human beings and still where do you find the time don't cheat your kids out of their own mom. do not use children to make money or self satisfaction at the end of the day you will be hurting them more then loving them  in her case the children are the ones that are going to have to be brave as a matter of fact the older ones are already doing that sorry i don't mean to be mean but those are the facts of life the children always suffer when the adults are selfish and don't put them first.  those children are here already i think everyone should say nothing if they don't have anything nice to say because when they are big they are going to be able to read all this nonsense and that is not going to make them happy ok so you don't like what she did but guess what they are not going away so you know what they say it takes a village to raise a child in this case 14 and hope for the best for each one of them they have done nothing to anyone they are just Innocent children so open your mouth just for solutions because opinions are like a..h..... everybody has one!|`|rFwGnZIJaa	People responding to this, understand that crazy people think they are normal and don't have the mental maturity to be reasonable and responsible. Nothing you can say will change Claudia G's mind. She is unfortunately going to populate the world with her equally "challenged" children. Also this could just be someone who is baiting the people that hate 'Octomom'.|`|vOomJtbsaa	I think you're just as nuts as she is!  She's highly irresponsible, expecting the rest of the world to pick up her slack.   You want to know why I don't have more children right now even though I'd like them?  It's because we're struggling to afford the one we do have, and we won't risk our childrens well being by bringing more into the world that we can't afford to care for.  That's the most selfish thing I've ever heard!!  On top of that, she knew that it would be impossible to carry 8 babies to full term, she only went to what 24 weeks?!  The moment she made that decision to put her childrens lives as risk like that, knowing they'd be in ICU for months, she should've been deemed an unfit mother, because she is!  I think her children should be adopted out to loving parents that can give them the attention and lifestyle they deserve, not all be cooped up in a shack, crowded and dirty and starved for attention, what kind of life is that?!|`|sHKrDChwaa	..not to mention a reality check and a conscience. I don't agree with what that woman has done. I love children as much as anyone could, but lets be honest.. how could anyone provide for that many children alone? Not just clothes, food and shelter.. but also time bonding. Not to mention the possibility of a future outside a hoard of siblings. How would you afford college for all these children? How would you explain having to deny them higher education? The children need to be thought of, not selfish wants of the adult.|`|og1CbIU3aa	lmao! you can't be serious?! She's loving every minute of this, she doesn't care! She had these kids for fame and money, that's so wrong in so many ways..you gotta be a complete idiot if you're thinking about doing the same...what if you don't make news?? then you're STUCK!!! STUCK!!! Go to school, and do something with your life, you don't wanna be like her, oh yeah she's living off of her parents, and she's getting welfare, she's demanding a lot of money for interviews, sounds like she's accepting hand outs....you freeloaders make me sick!|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I'm definitly not jelous of her lmao. I feel sorry for her. She is clueless and yes... BRAVE in a sarcastic way. I wouldn't be "brave" enough to bring more children into the world than I could afford or handle to say the least. I thought this question was all sarcasm in the beginning, now you are just as clueless as Octomom.|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	Your joking right?<br>  I think you just kidding, i mean i hope you are. She's selling her pregnancy tape for a million dollars to any news station that will buy it. First she looses her kids, then calls 911, and says on tape in front of her kids that she wants to kill herself. Great mom! Then she has 8 more, when shes not financially, or emotionally stable. Not to mention her appearance issues. Shes a nut job, and so are you if you see that woman as a role model.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Oh yes I am extremely jealous. I mean I only have to split my fiances pay packet on one child...gosh I wish it was 14! I only have to deal with one little weeny beeny when I am poorly...14 wowee that would be fun! I have friends, but it sure would be good to be hated on an international scale, now you've really got me thinking on this....<br>  <br>  (Really really hope your joking)|`|f4HsyUfQaa	I think she's NUTS to have so many babies at once. If you call her your hero.. then by all means do so... But don't expect the rest of the world to feel as you do.|`|5Np8w5MCaa	I really hope you are joking.  What she is doing is not brave, she is selfish.  She is using her children to get publicity and free money.  What she should have done was get a job like any normal human being.|`|kJSMn9rhaa	Of course she's not accepting help..except from Daddy Dearest and Dr. Phil...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_on_re_us/octuplets">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090310/ap_o...</a>|`|PTLXDmG4aa	i think if ppl were jelous more ppl would do it..<br>  i think she is an idiot.. not brave.. but prob missing a few screws.. haha|`|791NVofcaa	you're a moron.|`|9bu2ddK0aa	Here's my take - she should have thought of a way to provide for the first six (preferably BEFORE they were born) before even trying for more - regardless of whether she expected 2 more, or 8! I think she's a selfish user, who doesn't understand the impact that her lack of planning is having on her mother. She keeps stating that she is going to finish school, and THEN she will have a way to provide for the kids. That is SO backwards. I'd say "oh well," if she had one or two naturally, as life happens. Then you work on providing, instead of draining your poor mom dry. Instead she keeps on popping out kids, with no real way to provide. Her mom is filing bankruptcy, and doesn't have the means to provide for her family. She should be helping her mom, not taking money from her. Yeah, it sure is brave in the current economic times to have 14 kids with no job . . . It's nice to plan on finishing school, and get a high-paying job. That's what we all hope for. But the reality is that more jobs are laying off than are hiring. And she now has several special-needs kids who will need therapy (at a min. speech/physical), and hospital bills over 1 mil. Impossible to pay alone. My tax dollars will be hard at work raising those kids. Not that I necessarily mind, but I hate that everyone is emmulating her like she's a celebrity. She's a stupid, selfish woman, who is too immature to realize that her actions are negatively affecting other people in her life. It's not having a large family that's a crime - I have 7 siblings (and 2 married, stable parents). I love being part of a large family. But she acts so self-righteous, and says she will not seek any assistance, and that she DOES have a plan to provide. But right now she's sucking the life out of her mom, and too caught up in herself to even realize it.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Are you serious?  I think you need counseling just the same as she does.  She is totally irresponsible.  And she is wanting help.  Dr. Phil has set up a place to contribute money/items to her on his website.  However,  although I think she needs mental help, I do think she truly loves her kids, but something is not clicking in her head.  My husband and I won't even have a second baby b/c we know that we want to be at a different place in our finances and lives before we grow our family. I think you need a reality check if you idolize somebody who is in serious need of mental help and who is EXTREMELY irresponsible and selfish.|`|a9Ob3TjGaa	This is ridiculous as well is Nadya. She is irresponsible and selfish. She already had 6 children that is a tough job on its own and then she decides to have more.....8 more... She is already being very unfair to the children and the octuplets aren't even home yet. She was not prepared at all....even in the 9 months she was pregnant she never once got any sort of better living situation or anything she was content with living in her parents house and have them raise her children. Instead she waited until she had the children and is waiting for handouts I find this immature. If she is bringing these children into this world she should be able to provide for them. Even this new house isn't really big enough for 14 children. I am aware that the octuplets will all be sleeping 2 to a crib but eventually they will each need their own beds. She obviously wanted the publicity and this was the wrong thing to do....unbelievable that some ppl are actually this selfish. And if you think its a good idea to have plenty of children so you can get a nose job seriously grow the heck up. Have children because you love them and want them in your life not because you want to become a celebrity and hope to get $$$.....Seriously grow up|`|lD0VcAlpaa	How is she not accepting help? It's been well documented she's on food stamps (she says she doesn't consider this aid--BS!!) and her medical bills are all being covered by the great taxpayers of CA. She was on the news today talking about her new house being paid for by donations. She's photographed buying MAC cosmetics & getting manicures--while she should be out taking care of her children and getting a job. She's getting 12 nanny's, while her parents are going into bankruptcy. She's had two publicists quit on her, one for "death threats" and the second just flat out said she's a greedy, manipulative, loony person!! You're very naive to think this women is a hero, get a new role model. Oh and when you go and take fertility treatments--no responsible Dr. would impregnate you with that many eggs. Her doctor is being evaluated by the Medical Ethics board and is facing having his license taken away for malpractice. Good luck finding a "good doctor" like that.
7rCeCVl2aa	Very scary! It's more common than you think though. A lot of kids hold their breath when they have a temper tantrum. It's the one thing you CAN'T control and they know and use it.  (He is very young to be doing this already though...) Like all phases it will pass with time. It doesn't make it any easier though on you.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if he is purposefully holding his breath, he will pass out and start breathing again, worst case scenario....|`|7bdhpvc9aa	You need to call the doctor. This could be more serious and I would talk to the doctor about it first thing in the morning. He needs to be seen ASAP. If it ever happens again then you need call 911. Don't just think about taking that CPR Class I hope you do take it especially since this has happened. Good Luck & God Bless|`|AA11920812	VERY scary. The first time I saw my god daughter do that I nearly collapsed. Her mom said its most important for her to remain calm. And, she just blew on her face, held her, and splashed some water on her. Eventually she started crying again.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for other instances though. It seems every time she gets to crying hard or gets overly upset she does it. She has fallen before and done the same thing. <br>  <br>  Eventually she outgrew it. She will be two in April. The key is remaining calm. And, seeing when it will happen. This way you can prevent it. Calm her down. Blow in her face help her loose sight of her anger - distract her! Eventually she`ll manage it on her own.|`|ZQX4fjfdaa	It sounds llike your little angel is whats called a breathe holder. I have a six week old little boy who gave me the same heart attack. Mine luckily happened at the doctors office. His pediatritian was trying to clean out his nose with saline and because of that he got mad and held his breathe. Before i even knew what was going on she had flipped him on his back and was wacking him and was flicking the bottoms of his feet while yelling for the nurse to bring in oxygen. He obviously started breathing after that but i was terrified.! The pediatritian then told me that altho its not a terribly common occurance it does happen and the best thing to do is flick the bottoms of their feet. It causes pain and gets them to cry....which makes them breathe. Make sure ur doctor is aware of what is going on especially for those shot checkups. Also my little sister who is now a 16 year old used to hold her breathe til she passed out. She eventually grew out of it and it never did any brain  damage. Well I hope I was of some help! Good luck and dont stress out too much over it.
Fd4lITkvaa	It's fine. What do you think they did before air conditioning?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if it is in the 90s, i don't see a prob as long as it is not right in baby's face...the other poster said it wasn't in the 90s; i wouldn't do it if the wind was gonna be chilly...|`|IGwX328eaa	Make sure the wind isn't blowing in his face or he may have trouble breathing but other than that its fine. When my son was a newborn i was in the car with his father and I rolled down the window because it was about 80 degrees inside the car, he got mad and said i shouldn't open the window it was only open a crack.. i thought it was a little weird. Its perfectly fine to have the window open instead of making your son suffer in the heat|`|hi9SYnrraa	it is not in the 90s anywhere in tx. tom 80s statewide then a big cold fronts coming in.don't try to justify wanting your windows down with lies|`|7bdhpvc9aa	as long as the windows aren't down far enough to blow directly in his face then he should be fine. If the windows are down and the wind is blowing in his face it could definitely take his breath away.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	I've never heard this one!<br>  But given that there is extensive evidence that disease causing bacteria can build up in air conditioning systems I would not be running the air con unless it was extremely hot.|`|SWv7QWzKaa	As long as the dust doesn't get into irritate his eyes, its fine. maybe you could put up one of those baby sun mesh screens in some way, to keep off the dust? I'd have a word with the doc if you are still unsure.|`|pVpN9Kbuaa	yes of course but not all the windows close only those windows which is near to your child|`|gtGDr73Taa	i think its fine to close the window

cnK4X2sZaa	i agree you need to talk to a pro... i would love to give you advice, but theres just so much going on here. i wanna say postpartum... but i didnt go to school for this. it could be more and it sounds like it is. thyroid meds have no physiological side effects... she takes them b/c her thyroid isn't working properly. that i can tell you cause i take thyroid meds. but if what you say is how it is. you do need to get it all sorted out for your kids and you. also if its all factual i feel for you. i hope you can find the help you need for your family. the best of luck to you... also i dont know where your from but in Canada there are a lot of resources.. through the courts and family care programs. they can really help you out.<br>  again good luck all the best|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Seek counseling for your sake and hers.

You would be surprised what can happen when your hormones are out of whack, this might be a case of depression due to pregnancy. The hyperthyroid pills might mean that she has very low thyroid which in turn could make this depression worst and /or be the likely cause of the depression. In any case. Seems obvious to me that things aren't going to get better with medication, not between you two anyways I know it's hard and it's hard for the kids but it's life it happens and it sucks and you need to get court ordered shared custody and do what you can to try to make yourself happy start seeing other people and keep your kids as much in your life as possible.

HBgnkltfaa	Aoife Theresa (9/10) -- Beautiful!  I like how Aoife and Theresa balance each other.  Aoife feels contemporary but unfamiliar; Theresa isn't stylish at the moment, but she's classic and very familiar.  This is one of the combos where double "uh" endings work.<br>  <br>  Iona Helen (10/10) -- Absolutely lovely!  Very Greek!  Don't change a thing about this one.<br>  <br>  Mary Fionnuala (10/10) -- I love simple, classic Mary with a long Irish middle.  She sounds like a sweet little Irish girl.<br>  <br>  Saoirse Magdalene (9/10) -- I don't usually like Saoirse (I have a weird thing against Irish names with an "sh" sound), but I like her here.  Magdalene works wonders for almost any first name, methinks.<br>  <br>  Margaret Bernadette (4/10) -- Love Margaret, don't mind Bernadette, hate the double "t" endings.  One of the three names I thumbs-downed.<br>  <br>  Frances Maeve (7/10) -- This is pretty, but I preferred Frances Julia or Julia Frances.<br>  <br>  Rosanna Marguerite (10/10) -- Beautiful!  I love Rosanna, and the subtly-flower-themed Marguerite (French for "daisy") is the perfect complement.<br>  <br>  Catherine Niamh (7/10) -- Both names are beautiful, and the combo is fine but nothing special.  I think both names could sparkle more if you found different settings for them.<br>  <br>  Julia Regina (6/10) -- I love Julia, and I like the feel of Regina here, but the sound is off.  Both names are three syllable A-enders, so they don't flow well at all.  One of the three names I thumbs-downed.<br>  <br>  Delia Elaine (7/10) -- Delia is one of those names (like Talia and Liana) that feels less substantial than it is.  They're all meaningful historical names, but they sound so light and pretty that they seem made up.  Does that make sense?  I like Elaine, but both names feel too light -- they need something more substantial to anchor them.<br>  <br>  Tadgh Thomas (5/10) -- I'm not crazy about the alliteration here.  Still, it's a good pairing of the unfamiliar with the classic.  This was the only boys' name I thumbs-downed.<br>  <br>  Art Daniel (7/10) -- Definitely works better than Art Gerard.  I like it but don't love it.  The T-D transition between Art and Daniel isn't quite ideal since they're such similar consonants -- they tend to run together into one.<br>  <br>  Ronan Eugene (7/10) -- I like Ronan; I'm not crazy about Eugene, but the combo flows well.<br>  <br>  Martin Ignatius (8/10) -- Sounds very distinguished and educated.  I like it!<br>  <br>  Francis Oisin (7/10) -- Francis Xavier was definitely the better combo.  Since Francis has a soft, potentially feminine sound, you're best off pairing him with something familiar and very masculine.<br>  <br>  Desmond Gerard (10/10) -- I think you've found the perfect home for Gerard.  This combo takes him from slightly stuffy to positively dashing!<br>  <br>  Malachy Edward (9/10) -- This combo has a great flow, and it's a good pairing of trendy Irish with classic English.<br>  <br>  Seamus Brian (8/10) -- I'm not a Seamus fan.  There's nothing wrong with the name, but see the note above about Irish "sh" names -- that's completely personal, though, and not something that should bother you.  The combo is fine, though Brian feels a little strange as a middle name, perhaps because it was such a trendy first name 30 years ago.  In fact, my husband's first name is Brian, and I've tried to come up with good combos using it in the middle slot, but I just can't.  I think we're going to pass his middle name (Daniel) on to a son instead.<br>  <br>  John Dermot (7/10) -- I like both names, but together they feel kind of flat.  I think either one needs to be paired with something a bit more dashing... something like John Desmond or Adrian Dermot.<br>  <br>  Hugh Patrick (8/10) -- This is a good combo.  I'm not a huge fan of Hugh -- to my ears, it's more of a noise than a name.  Patrick's crisp consonant sounds provide a good contrast, though, so if you like it, I think you've found a good home for it.|`|eDfh1yhYaa	Is there any reason you have chosen mainly hard to pronounce and/or spell names??

mx3YK5rLaa	Well, my son wanted to be on the big potty so I got him a little toilet seat with the little raised front thingy for boys. I started my kids really young. After they turned one I put a little potty in the living room so they could get used to it, play on it, and make sure it wasn't harmful in any way then at about 13-15 months I started putting them on it. Of course they never peed, but it got them used to the idea. At about 16-17 months I showed them what peeing actually was and told them to pee pee on the potty. Both of my children, a boy and girl, were fully potty trained during the day by 20 months, at night by 28-30 months. Actually my son has been potty trained at night since before then. Every night I tell them to go potty before bed and I make sure they get no liquids a few hours before bedtime. I would tell the both of them every night that if they woke up and needed to go potty to get up and go in the bathroom. I would tell them that like 10 times, just repeat it over and over then I would ask them what I just told them. It worked and combined my kids have only peed the bed no more than 5 times. My daughter is 5 1/2 and my son is about to be 3.<br>  <br>  My son has never stood up to pee, only outside. I really don't think that at this young age they are capable of not making a huge mess all over the bathroom. I think when he turns 3 I'll get his daddy to teach him how to stand up and pee.|`|6HX4u0SRaa	for your daughter no drinking about 2 or 3 hours before bed. then make sure she goes to the potty. for your son if the father is around it would be best if he trained him have them go to the potty together or you can get something for him to aim at and put it in the potty|`|lqlfIEjNaa	Well my daughter was fully potty trained at 28 months. After one week of being potty trained I noticed she would stay dry all night, so I decided to just put underwear on her at night. <br>  You can't give them anything to drink 1 or 2 hours before they go to sleep and make sure they go to the bathroom before going to bed. <br>  <br>  The no drinking rule is very important. Think of it, they don't drink anything, they won't have anything to pee out. <br>  <br>  Give it a try.|`|YhVqEDyeaa	I would say let her choose the right moment to sleep with no diaper. <br>  My son is under 4 and just started being night time potty trained. I tried for about two months to let him pee before going to bed and sleep with no diaper. That was no success. So I gave up and put him a diaper again because I had enough of changing his bed. The diaper used to be full by morning!<br>  He decided one day that he was a big boy and asked to sleep with no nappy. That worked!<br>  I just try not to give him any liquid 2h hours or so before going to bed and he has a pot in case he needs to pee just right by his bed. He hasn't used it so far during the night.<br>  <br>  Your son is about the age of my daughter. She also started showing some interest because she sees her brother using the pot. I wouldn't say it is too early for them to be potty trained. Personally I'll wait the summer here so my daughter can run a bit freely and just wear pants. It is a bit cold where I live and my kids still have to wear a lot of clothes. <br>  I'll probably explain to my daughter what she has to do to pee or poo on the pot. I think she will get it quite quickly seeing her brother doing the same.
IlIjGTdiaa	Baby clothing is as bad as adult clothing in regards to sizes being completely different, so measure be weight rather than clothes.|`|70Z4DJOcaa	my son is HUGE, not a fat baby but he's chubby :) more cuddly, he is 4 months old and weighs 8kgs...and is wearing clothes that my friends 1year old baby is wearing!!!! my fiance is almost 7foot so i knew my son would be big... he was 9pounds OUCH lol i was worried cause i thought i was feeding him too much, i'm a first time mummy too, they dont stay babies for long thats for sure!!!! where has my tiny baby gone???? i had to turn his car seat around to the toddler stage today cause he's so big LOL|`|3klIx1Egaa	yea, my son is 5 months and wearing 9-12 months now. Hes so tall. Some babies wear the size for "age" and some dont. Be glad! means she is growing and healthy.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Might just have hit a growth spurt. My son was pretty little when he was born 5 pounds 11 oz so after coming home from the hospital and losing weight from being born he was tiny. Premature clothes were big lol. so he wore small clothes for a while. But once everything caught up he usually wore way bigger shirts bc he had a tummy lol|`|E87JwnACaa	yes, they have growth spurts where you cab practically see them growing|`|GNLYxY7kaa	yup my son was the same way...came out so small (6.9) and now at 7 mo he is 21 lbs.

7swefA6Paa	your husband would change his mind if he was feeling the pain you are going through|`|436fREgIaa	keep practicing..evetually,you'll enjoy it,because your baby wont be screaming and crying.and your husband wont have to do all the work and look and think  of you with negativity.perhaps your going through postpartum depression and dont even realize it.but the more you keep active with duties..the better you will feel.|`|Xcyaju2vaa	I don't think it's wrong--I do think there is a period of adjustment when the baby first comes home. If you have had the baby home for more that a week and still are feeling the way you described above-you should talk to your Dr.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i agree i know it doesnt mean you dont love your baby..i sure dont really like cleaning poop all day and he vomits all over me sometimes..and most of all i dont like waking up in the middle of sleep to hold a bottle for 20mins while my son takes his cool time sipping on his formula...i love him but sometimes i dont like how much work it is to care for him..i got to do what i have to but i love him so much..|`|u9sGH0AXaa	I sort of felt this way after my c-section as well.  I mean, you just had major surgery and now have to care for another human being.  I remember I would be changing her diaper in tears because my back hurt so bad.  You will get better.  You will enjoy it more.  Just take all the help you can get and don't worry, in time you will be back to normal.|`|vm8HtVUYaa	'oh and yes my husband does alot to help out with the baby he loves to change diapers ..'<br>  <br>  LOL.<br>  If your husband 'LOVES' changing diapers, maybe HE is the one with the problem .. I have never heard of anyone who 'loves' diaper changing...|`|59f0d623da24062341c864749a68da9daa	It's not wrong to dislike these things.  Your husband, despite what he says, is NOT going through what you're going through, so he has NO IDEA how he would react.  You may want to talk to your doctor about what you can do to make the situation better--if pain medicine won't work, maybe other things can relieve the tiredness, etc.  <br>  <br>  Tell your husband to cut a big hole in his "place," stop taking any iron (to mimic the anemia), be in surgery for a few hours, etc., and then he can start to criticize your attitude.|`|H1nQTS6faa	dont let ignorance bring you down you are not a complainer!<br>  <br>  I used to be a nurse for a pediatrician and this is very normal you have just had a child and it sounds like you may have a touch of the baby blues, but this is ok as long as it does not go past about 2 months after 2 months speak to your obgyn and see if she can Rx something for you...A baby is a big change and your body and your rising and decreasing harmones are having to adjust to this...trust me eventually you will love to breast feed and well no one likes to hear a crying baby or change diapers.... but you will eventually do this with love it just takes some mommies more time then others... do not stress over your husband men will never know what women go through. Try to explain to him that it hurts you to hear these things and let him know encouragment would help better <br>  (tell him this in a nice tone) God bless <br>  <br>  and please email me if you need to talk|`|gWiZAsfBaa	No, it's not wrong for you to feel that way. It takes time to try and get used to those things. Your husband doesn't understand what you're going through. I had PUPPs during my pregnancy too. It lasted for a month after I had my son. It is our custom to bind our stomach for a month. I tried to bind my stomach, but the cloth kept rubbing against my rash and only made it worse. I had trouble trying to breastfeed my son because he would lay across my rash and it would get irritated. I finally gave up on both of them. I started pumping for my son and gave up binding my stomach. <br>  <br>  I'm happy to hear that your husband is so willing to help you out with your baby. They usually are during the first few months, so take advantage of it. My husband changes our son's diaper once a week.|`|h3Ed9qm9aa	I am sorry you are not feeling well! It is not good that your husband blames you this way, but it is great that he helps you with the baby and changes diapers. You have a right not to feel well but hang in there, you will get better. I did not have csection but forceps delivery and I also was not well aftwards, but it eventually all went back to normal.<br>  I found that my baby who is now 5 months old became easier to manage starting 2 months of age, before this it was nightmare.<br>  Things will get  better within weeks, so just do what you can and do not feel bad.<br>  By the way, breastfeeding should not hurt if baby is latched properly, with big chunk of your breast in his mouth. If it hurts, that means he is not latched properly. I found it also helps to use Widgey nursing pillow for breastfeeding, and after birth, to use Lansinoh nipple cream,to preven breaking of skin.|`|hzxplycYaa	No one likes hearing babies cry all night. No one likes having their breasts tugged and bitten at. No one enjoys doing all those stuff. It's clearly a misconception that some men think women should actually "enjoy" doing these stuff. What you're going through is completely normal. I'm 18 and my mother has been by my side all these years. She has admitted to me that she hated breastfeeding me, hearing me cry when she was trying to sleep, and change my dirty diapers. It's a normal thing, so don't worry. Your husband shouldn't say that he would "love" what you're going through because he actually has NO idea of what it feels like to be a woman/mother, without actually BEING one. And it's NOT WRONG, my friend. I work at Target and I see some hot tempered mothers yelling at their two year old to shut up. Some even punish their children in public for misbehaving. now, clearly THOSE are wrong intentions of raising a child.|`|kvxPrkDoaa	its not, it hurts you and your not getting any sleep of course its going to bother you. But like you said your a mother that loves there child and you just have to endure it.  To make it easer force yourself to think of how amaizing and how lucky you are to be gifted this joy, of course you already feel this way but try and think about all this when your doing all these painful tasks and it may take a little of the strain off, happyness is a pain killer.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I am sorry that your are in so much pain and understand how pain can make everything miserable. I suggest that you sit down and tell your husband everything that you have written here and if he doesn't take your feelings into consideration I would really question what kind of husband he is. Sometimes men don't fully understand how we are feeling and need to be told directly. Also I am wondering if you are getting a little of the baby blues or some postpartum depression. I would call and talk to your doctor about the baby blues. I wish you the best of luck.|`|Jm1M5j10aa	This probably doesn't mean much, coming from a fifteen year-old guy, but I would probably hate having to breast feed, change diapers, and hear a baby cry despite the fact I'm doing it out of parental love.   <br>  <br>  It can be hell, but cherish your parent hood while you can, I guess. :)<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|gUIhXGNeaa	Changing dirty diapers is never the funnest thing in the world. <br>  Breastfeeding does hurt, I know this, my son made my nipples bleed before.<br>  And when your tired and your baby is screaming its head off...yes, it can fluster some people. <br>  You'll get used to it over time though.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Maybe you should tell your Dr and recieve some help from nurse if possible.. They will give you a breast pump so your husband can feed her and you can sleep....|`|NXodF671aa	When something hurts, it's hard to find enjoyment in it. A lot of people don't realize the restrictions of a c-section. It's a horrible thing to know what you should be able to do with ease, and not actually be able to do it. I think you're normal, and your husband needs to be more understanding to your situation. Of course you take care of your bub - There's no way around that, but he should understand that if it hurts it isn't enjoyable.|`|QPnBOom2aa	dont swet it.. some moms go through depression after a new born , but in your case i dont think that tat is it..since you are going through pain and are tired alot, it is okay to feel discoraged about changing diapers or fixing the babies problems.. but just know that that stuff will get easier with time.. also just try to make those times with your baby your special times with her.. because before you know it shelle be grown up and you wont have those moments you wished you cherished. <br>  you will be fine.. just enjoy every laugh and smile and cuddle with your baby and cope with the rest for now.. also talk to your husband openly about your concerns... helle understand<br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|lRmhwiYpaa	You could be suffering from the BABY Blues<br>  a real psychological ailment for new mothers<br>  and some older mothers<br>  Most men don't understand the trauma of child birth
RT55N756aa	do not correct every little mistake he makes that will make him self conscious and uncomfortable about talking <br>  <br>  try reading to him every night and just have conversations with him everyday he will pick it up eventually<br>  <br>  also remember that kids develop at different rates so dont freak out just because he isnt talking like your sister in laws kids|`|SWv7QWzKaa	In answer to your question, you do not have to do anything. Just sing to him. tell him stories and play  or include him in whatever you are doing whenever you can. All kids love that. I love seeing my daughter do it with her 2 year old. <br>  <br>  My oldest child, started reading aged 3 but most of the friends didn't start till they were aged 5 or 6. All went to University at 18. All graduated. Do not worry. OK? <br>  <br>  All kids are different. Their growing comes in lots of different ways.<br>  I worked in kindergartens where some of the children talked a lot and some didn't. That was just the way of it. <br>  <br>  Amongst my own friends, there are some who are always talking and you cannot get a word in edge-ways. <br>  <br>  I would guess your sister in law would quite like a little quiet time some days if her kids talk a lot. Be happy you don't have that problem.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and to your son.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Reading to a three year old is a wonderful pass time for them, and very helpful for comprehension and learning new words.<br>  <br>  Three year olds usually do not have a huge attention span for stories, so if you could get books with lots of pictures, and talk about the pictures you both see, that would work out well.  Toddlers usually adore pictures.|`|pVLJxzzlaa	Reading and Language go hand and hand.Read to your child. Ask question,instead of commands. For example, 'can you pick up your toys", and "use you words to tell me what you want".  Use songs and music cds that encourage interaction. Talk to your pediatrician and share your concerns. Children learn through play, so make it fun.Oh, and did I mention reading..? Check local library for story time.|`|DDheLPezaa	The best way to encourage a child to speak is through reading to him, inviting him to participate in activities, and also to play music for him.  The most advanced pieces are classical.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	"ok my son do not talk like my sister laws kids"...hmmm hope they dont talk like you either|`|3F8f1SoQaa	call the local elementary school and ask them for a speech evaluation. It is quite possible that he has a totally treatable speech delay. If they find that he does, they may have a spot for him in the special needs preschool. My very smart ( I am not biased, I swear) 3.5 year old was diagnosed with a speech delay at 2 years old when he only said 10 words. He went into early intervention until he turned 3, then switched to the preschool. I have not paid anything for his treatment and he has made TONS of progress.|`|PtqN5WM3aa	Chat to him. Ask him questions. What is his favourite tv show? What is his favourite colour? How is he feeling today? What is his favourite dinner? Which pair of pj's are his favourite? Where is his favourite place in the whole world? The questions are endless.<br>  <br>  Don't ask questions that can be answered with a yes, no or pointing. You need to get him expressing himself with lots of words.<br>  <br>  Some kids just aren't as chatty as other kids, so don't compare him to anyone else. He is who he is, and that's ok. Your sister in law has more than one child. They will compete to get attention and talking is a way of getting attention. Your little fella is an only child. He already has your attention and isn't sharing it with anyone else, so you need to help him communicate.<br>  <br>  When he goes to preschool, he will most likely learn to chat with the other kids, but until then, you can help him just by making sure you encourage his speech and please make sure you are actually listening to him. If he feels that no one is listening when he does talk, he just won't bother. I know it's hard if you're watching something on tv, or talking with a friend, but don't ignore him and let him see that you are actively listening to what he says. xxx|`|BHIiO22taa	Please don't listen to people who say "MAKE him say something" or "correct his mistakes". <br>  <br>  You don't want to force him and put pressure on him tar could result in him speaking even less. If he tries to say something and gets it wrong,you can simply say it correctly in a sentence. If the child says " wanna kuh-eee", say "you want a cookie? Ok here is a cookie". <br>  <br>  Yes, reading to him is great! Especially simple books that label objects (a picture of a ball with the word printed below it). Keep it simple, casual & fun. <br>  <br>  Contact a speech therapist if u are still worried.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Just correct everything he says if he isnt saying it right. And make him use words instead of pointing for things he wants. If he wants a cookie then be like "would you like a cookie" then when you have him the cookie tell him COOKIE. He will get it.|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	Read to him.  Talk to him lots.  Make him ask for things when he wants something.
mZrydsoKaa	I think too much of Black Dahlia when I see it spelled that way. If you spell it Dalia, it has the same meaning and pronouciation as Dahlia without all of the connotation that follows it.|`|2bcZbaQQaa	Well, it makes me think of the Black Dahlia, so I wouldn't use it has a name, cause that's the first think I thought of when I saw that name.|`|Am54a7c0aa	Yes, I think it is very nice!|`|NYEUyRNqaa	I do! Very nice...and you don't hear it too often!|`|AA11307951	Sure, if you don't mind that your daughter's name would be referencing a gruesome unsolved 1948 murder.  <br>  <br>  Google "Black Dahlia"|`|lY3jSaWdaa	It's ok :) I personally like "Eden", "Ivy" and "Jennette" for girls names :)|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	DEELAH is close without making people think of the murder.|`|MetVwIYPaa	Sure..It's different..my niece's name is Tahlia...|`|4b5IQWcFaa	itz exotic and rare<br>  <br>  i also like delilah|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	Yes!

kRaVa0Wraa	you'll get over it eventually, but it is hard.<br>  my older brother is now  a senior in college, and it was weird not having him around.<br>  after he's graduating he's moving to sydney, australia though. even farther away! im going to miss him.<br>  <br>  give your sister a call or text her if you miss her. but not too often, because shes out having fun at college!|`|2ktp7dEUaa	It's normal. It just shows that you really love and care about your sisters. Call and talk to them about how you feel, and see if you can plan to talk to them atleast once a week. It will be hard, but it's going to get easier. Good luck. =]|`|Yl9741EZaa	I think you have some deep and emotional letting go issues.<br>  You may need to talk to someone about how your feeling and see if thats starting to make you feel better.<br>  <br>  Also have you tried talking to your sisters to let them know?|`|wITZ6ltYaa	you should get a psychologist to help you get unattached to them in a healthy positive way.<br>  <br>  :)|`|x1qKGmzSaa	aww. its sweet. but i dont really know. its not BAD or anything. maybe talk to them about it or ur parents or something<br>  <br>  :)|`|BBfIXcI0aa	It's totally normal - my best friend, who I consider my little sister, is two years younger than all of my other friends and I (we're off at college now), and every great now and then she'll call and say she misses us and ask us all to come home ASAP. Letting go of people you love is difficult, especially when you're used to being with them all the time, but it can be dealt with.<br>  <br>  First of all, stay in contact. If your older sister has Myspace or Facebook and you don't, talk to your parents about getting one and keeping the privacy settings very secure so only you and your sister and friends can access your information. If you both already have one, start a message to keep an ongoing conversation about whatever is going on in your life - it's fun to see how many responses fit on a message before it makes you start a new one! Plan a time each week or every couple of weeks to talk on the phone. When you're a little older, you and your sister that still live at home might be able to go hang with your big sis for a weekend.<br>  <br>  Letting your middle sister go will actually be easier. You'll make a lot of friends next year in high school, and you'll be so busy with them and the after-school activities I know you're going to get involved in that you won't have as much time to miss her. Before you know it, you'll be off to school, too!
auFmP7J1aa	yes!<br>  <br>  most women's breasts get larger when they <br>  become pregnant, but some women's actually<br>  do get smaller. so that's yes.<br>  <br>  a lot of women might not get morning sickness,<br>  either just because or from genes. so that's yes.<br>  <br>  nausea and craving are huge signs of<br>  pregnancy. so that's yes. <br>  <br>  and the pulling out method is the worst method<br>  in the world. it never works. a woman can <br>  get pregnant (though slight chance, but it <br>  could) by just having the guy in her, and not<br>  really doing anything.<br>  <br>  so i really believe she is pregnant.<br>  <br>  it's just harsh to punch her in the stomach.<br>  that's not a nice or pleasant or even definite<br>  way to get rid of the baby.|`|1pUIwBM1aa	It's *she doesn't, not she don't. <br>  <br>  Pulling out doesn't always mean you won't get pregnant. Morning sickness might come later, not instantly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow. If they are obiviously stupid enough to try and beat/kill an unborn baby they shouldn't be having sex and are idiots, and I'm not surprised she got pregnant (if she is.)|`|TX9igTWraa	if she took a test and it came out positive then she IS pregnant. there are NO false positives. tell her and her bf to grow up and get some help. if they end up keeping the baby it could have problems if they tried to "punch" it out of her|`|GoWPQvgHaa	She doesn't want the baby. So she's going for a cheap abortion plan...|`|rFwGnZIJaa	If the test is positive, she is pregnant. Some women don't get very many symptoms till later in the pregnancy. Punching won't kill the baby at this stage because it's too small and by the time that it could do some  damage she would still have to have the you know what kicked out of her to end the pregnancy. If the baby is aborted that way there could be permanent damage to her. Don't do the punching way. I know this might sound like betraying your friend but you should say something to an adult like her mother so you can prevent your friend from seriously getting hurt and give her support that she needs. Your friend has to realize that she made a decision to have sex and must deal with the consequences like a mature adult.|`|2zC1lpfVaa	Why to punch heer in the stomach? pregnant or not, they should not do that.  If they don't want the baby, just put her/him into adoption.<br>  <br>  In reference to the symptoms, not everybody would experiece the samething.  It is not a formula that every pregnant women will have morning sickeness, and sore.  If the test came out positive, then she may be pregnant.|`|jJTGKkSuaa	u need to talk her out of that. and if she is pregnant...tell her abortion is not an option|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Well I am very much Pro Life and Anti Abortion but she could do so much damage to herself. She needs to FIND OUT for sure. Then, she needs to have an abortion if she is going to do something like that. And then, she should stop using the pull out method. The pull out method is not a method, it did him no good to pull out, he just might as well not have, she has the same chances of getting pregnant. If she is going to have sex then she needs to use a condom or take responsibility for her actions. You did not mention how old you guys are but I have a feeling she is either very young or very stupid. She needs to simply keep her legs together until she educates herself on how to protect against pregnancy ans STD's, and maybe it could save an unborn child from being murdered in her hands.<br>  <br>  She does not have to experience any symptoms to be pregnant, false positives are not very common.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	This is just ridiculous..hmm..i guess they will realize the importance of practicing safe sex the hard way. It doesn't matter if she is not showing symptoms..she could be one of the lucky ones that has a breeze pregnancy..but the fact that she had a positive pregnancy test means she needs to go see a doctor and have an exam..whether it be going to her parents and telling them she may be pregnant and having them set her up an appt or going to a place like planned parenthood and having a consultation herself. If she is WANTING her boyfriend to kick her in the stomach in order to get rid of the baby..she is in need of MENTAL HELP..i don't care how young she is or how freaked out she is that is NOT NORMAL! You need to step up and take action before she does something stupid like this..tell her parents..or whatever you have to do..leave an letter in the mail box..something..god please for the poor innocent babys sake[if she is indeed pregnant, judging by her appearant mental stability she may be faking for attention..?]|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Punching will not abort the baby. If that's all it took to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy, women would be punching themselves in the stomach all over the place. There wouldn't be a need for abortion clinics or teen pregnancy clinics. <br>  <br>  Punching may cause internal bleeding and birth defects. <br>  <br>  Talk to your school counselor ASAP!|`|yNoENquTaa	punching might not even kill the baby. it is way down in the pelvis. he would hve to crush her bones to get anywhere near the baby. <br>  and that is a barbaric thing to do. they can get an abortion if they are really that desperate.<br>  and if the test read positive then she is pregnant. lots of women have no symptoms in their pregnancies.|`|EgRt4LMfaa	that soon it shouldnt do anything-they are surrounded by fluid that protects it better than u think--she should leave him|`|2IZwPhY3aa	DONT PUNCH!!!! it could kill ur friend just go to a free clinic and hey could take it our with her parents not even knowing|`|v84od8vraa	Call the damn cops on both idiots and buy them some condoms or something!! If you can prevent them from doing something stupid, then be the hero for that baby and do it! If they are that stupid to plan on such cruel thing for a baby, call the cops and tell their parents! What does this world keep coming too!! Crazy, crazy, crazy!! Bottom line, dont let this happen, do the best you can to avoid such cruelty, and advice her to go to the dr. to find out for sure. If she is, tell their parents and as her friend, advice her to keep the baby! That baby deserves to live, he/she didnt ask to be here, and only God decides whether he/she is born! And there is always adoption, but not abortion, and definately not murdering an unborn child and injuring the mother by punching her in the stomach!!|`|DSMaUGQYaa	false positives on tests are pretty much non-existent. if she tested positive, she's pregnant.<br>  tell her to just have the baby and give it up for adoption... or else if she really wants to terminate the pregnancy then go to the doctors and get it professionally done.<br>  punching her in the stomach?? what the hell? that is so immature and disgusting, it makes me thing she and her boyfriend aren't mature enough to be having sex in the first place if they're going to do something like that.|`|hpJdK2ULaa	false positives can happen god does anyone read the paper that comes with the test before pissing on the stick. no morning sickness? oh not pregnant, god there douches, some people dont get sick , if there lucky. yeah lets punch the baby? god some women some 38 weeks prego fall on therevstomach and baby is FINE. i was 17 when i got prego, tell her if shes grown up enough to have sex then she is grown up enough tovtell mom and dad and to not be such a retard little girl|`|ksWm9eCBaa	So you're telling me their best guess is that she is pregnant so he's going to save a little (above an abortion) or a lot (instead of letting the child live a normal life) and Try To Kill the Baby by Punching Her In the Stomach. O. My. Gosh.  <br>  She can actually be pregnant with no symptoms whatsoever.  A positive test is usually right.  (Negatives may be off/positives are usually right).  And forget "...but he pulled out"...they may as well have been using condoms with holes all three times....She much-more-than likely IS pregnant.<br>  You sound like a sane, rational, worried friend.  This supposed game plan is horrible....maybe you could use your rationality to direct them to a clinic for some help?  Am guessing all involved are younger?  No support system to turn to?  May be there...closer than you think.  Ooooo: good luck!!!|`|RPoFBenJaa	You friend IS pregnant. A positive test 99.9% of the time never lies. If her boyfriend is going to punch her, they need to consider that it probably wont kill the child but instead cause it to be handicapped or have a mental disability. And if it did die, consider that MURDER. You need to confront your friend or tell her parents. Or YOUR parents.|`|AA10967880	shes pregnant she needs to talk to her doctor about safe ways to remove the foetus. <br>  <br>  make sure they dont do this as alot of woman have been killed by this method of aborting the foetus. what happens instead of rupturing the foetus they cause extreme bleeding and the woman can die from internal hemeragin.|`|b30zbnqPaa	there are no false positives in pregnancy tests, only false negatives. so if she took a test and it said it was positive, then she is definitely pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make sure that he does not punch her in the stomach though!!!!!!!

And not everyone have them right off the bat.<br>  <br>  She may want to take another test, by a doctor, if she does not have on, there are places she can get checked for free.<br>  <br>  Also, to have her baby lost that way, with planning on it, will result in both of them going to jail. <br>  <br>  You might as well say it's manslaughter.<br>  <br>  Best of Wishes!|`|AA11839888	only a doctors test can be reliable, she needs to have the kid and put it up for adoption andthen her and boyfriend need to be sterilzed because they are both dumbasses who never need to be parents.<br>  he could reupture and her bleed to death, then hed be charged with two murders.|`|7jXChfBNaa	what ******* little idiots...there are not any false positive tests so she is pregnant. it's not the poor babies fault, they never asked to be conceived. someone should punch him in the stomach. and just cause she doesn't have all of the symptoms doesn't mean she's not pregnant.|`|YpOSu2tWaa	that's crazy..just because he punches her in the stomach isn't a guaranteed answer..She needs to talk to her mom or school counselor this is not something to joke around with..and her bf is obviously not responsible enough to be having sex with a Response like that.|`|tptFCrfraa	shes pregnant and try 2 talk them out of it, and say theres other options like adoption and stuff, and punchin in the stomach is deff not the way 2 go, if she doesnt want it period then she should get an abortion|`|c5AJGcYcaa	if the test said she was then she is. Some women never have symptoms til they get a lot further along.<br>  <br>  Punching her in the stomach, stupid idea. and really it won't work, except to hurt her.|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Punching her now will have no effect but to hurt her, The baby is far to small.

Poor possible baby|`|yR5BhCAzaa	While I do disagree with previous answerers - there are false positives.<br>  <br>  With that said - your friend and her boyfriend are both immature and clueless. That's the nicest way to put it.  You need to call the cops, call TIPS, call somewhere. <br>  <br>  If she had a positive test and no period = pregnant! Hello!?!?!<br>  <br>  Not everyone gets sore boobs and morning sickness. I've been pregnant twice, and never had sore boobs or morning sickness. It's a shame someone this dumb is having an easy beginning to a pregnancy. . .<br>  <br>  And I don't agree that abortion is the other answer. Adoption is. So she doesn't want the baby? She should put it up for adoption for the families out there that aren't so fertile. If she doesn't want to be pregnant for 9 months, she should have thought about that before laying down.<br>  <br>  Wrap it up, everytime. The pull out method does NOT work. That's how several people are on this Earth today!|`|C1cd0KvSaa	That's retarded and in some states considered murder or assult... Surgery, or don't abort.

The symptoms are only "many women get..." and doesn't mean everyone gets all of them.  Get your friend to a doctor--Planned Parenthood if nothing else just to see if she is really preg or not.  You can't really make any decisions until you know for sure.  And Planned Parenthood will talk to her about all the choices she has if she is preg.  Punching someone in the stomach won't normally work unless the punch is so hard it may rupture something else (for which your friend will need surgery and may then also lose the baby).  There are far safer ways of stopping a preg.  If your friend insists on having sex, she really needs to stop having unprotected sex.  Not only does she risk getting preg but also puts herself at risk of STDs.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Call the cops, tell her parents, something........ tell everyone you can think of if she dose it, that will teach her, bedised she is not far enough along yet, she can be punched in the stomach all she wants, the baby is not in the stomach its in the uturas which is way below her stomach a little bit above her blatter. and they baby is very well protected in there with all the amniotic fluid. And if she thinks she will miscarry because of that then she is stupid, probably to stupid to be having sex, and a moron for having unprotected sex and a jackass for thinking pulling out would do anything, what is she 12?<br>  <br>  also so soon she would not get bigger (if she is she is just bloted), morning sickness and sore breasts usually come later, but not right away.<br>  <br>  all punching is going to do is make her curl in a ball in pain for a bit, wont hurt the baby tho, just her and she deserves it too.<br>  <br>  <br>  ice_cold, Are you stupid or what? You can get a false positve if you are taking medication with the HCG horomon in it, but other then that you usually dont.<br>  <br>  more chance of getting a false negitive then a positive<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry but the little dumbass needs to go to the doctor to find out for sure before her b/f uses her stomach as a punching bag
yQ0OzEbZaa	I completly agree that social workers should taking octomom's children away from her and put them up for adoption. I feel a woman should first be married and financially stable to bring a child into the world or even a whole litter of kids.  She’s still jobless and husband-less with 14 kids. On welfare. Splurging on video games. Moving out of a home owned by her mom, who’s $20,000 behind on mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now Octo-mommy is moving in to a half-million-dollar southern California home arranged for by dad and reportedly paid for with the cash she’s been raking in from her Octo-mom notoriety. <br>  <br>  I know I’m not the only one with the sick feeling that taxpayers will be on the hook for this financial basket case sooner rather than later.  o_O<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-new-house/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/09/octomom-ne...</a>|`|jtnS02Vxaa	Those children are taken care of. She has help. Although she doesn't have the financial standards, she is taking care of her children. They have their basic needs taken care of. They all looked happy and healthy when I seen them on tv. Yea she shouldn't have implanted that many embryos but it is a free country she's entitled to how ever many children she wants. I agree with the previous answer I'd rather see cps at a home where children are truly neglected, or abused than deal with something like this woman.|`|kRui5wGtaa	Honestly, I think that the woman is going to have her hands full and that it is crazy to have that many children when you are single and blah blah blah... you have heard it all. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, is it really best to take them all away from their mother? To separate them? To have them sit in an orphanage until someone wants them? They say that they are going to try to find someone who will take all of the babies, but what are the chances of someone wanting to adopt 8 infants, all the same age? Come on now....that really is NOT what is best for the children.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I think the CPS should be concentrating on those children being harmed, who arent loved and are being neglected.<br>  Unless Nadya becomes a danger to her children i dont think they should be taken away to be honest.<br>  Yes, i think she is crazy and sly..but everybody makes stupid mistakes. <br>  <br>  There are too many children falling through this program for them to be worrying about children that may be in a loving home...which is ALOT better than some kids have!|`|9UCvu7RYaa	BECAUSE DR PHIL IS HELPING HER AND MAKING IT SEEM LIKE SHE'S NORMAL. When she said herself that she only wanted one more and there are plenty of people that don't need help to support a kid and CAN'T have any. So personally, IF IT WASN'T FOR DR PHIL my vote would be that she should have given seven or at least six of them up for adoption. Not because she doesn't love them, but because she loves them enough to know that she doesn't want to spread herself thin.  She wants her children to have a strong support system.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***the media subjects us to this DUMB BULLSH**T and then when we get mad about the stupidity of the individuals involved then they try to humanize the individual to appeal to our sensitive side......as long as those babies are healthy and are going to get everything they need, I'm glad and I'll be happy when they're done talking about this.|`|WKxi3gWBaa	because the government is jacked... they dont care.. its less kids to go through the system the better. they could care less about their well being ..... mark my words she will go psycho and kill her children then there really will be a huge mess on the governments hands and millions wanting answers... she is clearly out of her mind to begin with.. its really sad... more of our tax dollars hard at work....|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Apparently, she's not committed any crime against her children... that's the most sane answer i can think of<br>  <br>  why is everyone obsessed with this person anyway?|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Because they are HER kids?<br>  She isnt abusing or neglecting them, they have no right to take them away.|`|WNZUyqibaa	I don't know,but they definitely should.

856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Yep...as baby gets bigger, he stops having bowel movements nearly as often as when he's a tiny baby.  Seems like at first they go every time you change a diaper.<br>  <br>  If you are worried though, I would ask your doctor.  Mother always knows best.  You know your little man.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	Yes, that is normal.  I breastfed for the first 4 months (had to supplement with formula) and my daughter missed a day's poop.  I called her doctor and she said that breastfed babies can literally go days (I think she said 5) without a poop.  If you're supplementing, two days or so.  No worries. :)|`|GMQfejxKaa	This is completely normal at that age, it could even be days between bm's and there is nothing to worry about.|`|7GDSgxagaa	Yes, that is totally normal!  As your baby gets older, he may only have a bm once a day, or once every two or three days, or even week!  Breastmilk is so efficiently digested that there is little waste!  Just keep breastfeeding on demand and keep counting the wet diapers (8 to 12 per day at this age).
xJW1RSaAaa	No -what does that mean?<br>  <br>  If someone keot saying to you - no, no, no -whenever you wanted to do soemthing - would you listen, or would you feel resentful and start to ignore them/<br>  <br>  Yes they are your children, they should respct you. BUT you have to respect them.  Set boundaries and rule, yes I know how hard it is, my 2 year old bullies me into letting him watch cartoons. May be set time they can watch TV, then do something with them to tire them out (park, ball games etc) and then set them an activity up - painting, drawing, making cakes or muffins - and while they are doing that - that is YOUR TIME.<br>  <br>  Try to see it form your children's viewpoint. Explain to them that it isn't good for them to watch too much TV - eyesight, need exercise. Then offer them a choice of 2 activities - never more as that's too much choice.  <br>  <br>  Try not to shout - people don't respond to shouting or violence in a nice way. Be calm, take a deep breath! Explin when they are doing their paintings that daddy would really appreciate it if they would let you watch your programme. in the break, go to them, check they are ok, give them a hug each and a kiss and say thank you for letting me watch my prgramme, that is really nice of you, you'll come and do something with them soon, when it is finished.<br>  <br>  Trust me - this even works occassionally with a 2 year old!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	if you want your kids to respect and listen to you you have to make them. you have to enforce the rules, not just inform them of them so they can go on about their business anyway.|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	You said it yourself....your kids don't respect you. You have to make the rules, and you have to enforce them. You have to have punishments to back it up if they don't listen. I'm amazed with the way I see some kids act in public! Then, I see them yell or hit their parents! OMG!!! I would NEVER have gotten away with that as a child! My mom pretty much just had to give me a look and I would straighten up. If you set limits and enforce them, kids WILL learn, and they'll be better off for it!|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Ok, I am an advocate for spanking.  However, there is something else that I find to be very effective if you are opposed to spanking.<br>  <br>  Time out.  I know this sounds silly, but the principal of it works great.  The whole idea of "time out" is removal from a situation.<br>  <br>  When you tell your children something, and they don't listen, they get a time out.  If they don't stay where you put them, then just do the act of time out.  IGNORE.  If you are watching tv, and your daughter bugs you, ignore her.  Don't even look in her direction.  She will soon realize that acting that way is not going to give her the attention that she wants.<br>  <br>  Kids want attention whether or not its positive.  So you want to make sure that you are playing with her, reading to her, and doing activities with her often.  Kids that get the right amount of positive attention from their parents are less likely to be desperate and act up.<br>  <br>  Also, positive reinforcement.  When your children are doing the right thing, praise them.  Tell them how proud of them you are when they exibhit the correct behavior.<br>  <br>  Also, cut out some of the cartoons.  Kids should not watch more than about an hour of tv a day.  Easier said than done, but that is what parenting is all about.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I am really into spiritual psychology & we might not be aware of it but we communicate telepathically. Your girls are probably hearing your words but also energetically hearing you say "I love you & just want you to be happy" so they do what they want to be happy. I was remembering the other day, something that happened when I was 6. My mother let me stay up to watch the Wizard of Oz but she told me that as soon as it was over I had to go straight to bed. Well, I was terrified to go upstairs so there was a big power struggle that took place. It was funny b/c now I can see that my mother was tired or needed to make sure I got my rest but all I knew was that my mother was being mean & the green wicked witch would get me if I went upstairs. So children don't mean to cause so much trouble they have thier own reasons for everything just like adults do.<br>  You have to visulize them co-operating with you cause when you can see it & feel it happening you will see it happen. Once a man name Wayne Dyer who is a popular author had a huge audience of people he was speaker to & a man got up to walk out cause he baby was crying. Wayne yelled to him "where are you going?" the man said I can't get the baby to stop & don't want to disturb others. Wayne asked the man to go sit back down & asked everyone to do something like think peaceful thoughts. I think they sat there for another couple of hours with the baby calm & peaceful. So you children pick up on you. Know you are in charge, happy, calm & peaceful & they will be too.|`|145RUNQHaa	Why do you expect to sit there watching the tv in peace while you have two young children.it doesn't work that way watch tv when they are in bed.it's not that they don't respect you it's the opposite they love you and want your attention.i think expecting to watch the tv in peace is expecting too much that only happens when you don't have children.spend the time trying to teach them something instead or if you must attempt to watch the tv give your little ones something else to do that will keep them occupied for a short while.it'll get easier when they are older for now have patience and don't fight against parenthood there's little peace when your children are small so embrace the chaos you'll miss them when they're grown.x|`|AA10824931	When a parent makes a ruling then the parent has to follow through all the time.  Use a firmer voice when you daughter challenges you on the TV.  If she continues, send her to her room and do this every time and soon she will catch on that you are the parent and she is the child.  Always, follow through no matter how tired you are.  Good luck and enjoy the kids....and don't spoil them too much and love them even more!|`|xGr2QYWDaa	That is why when they are very young, you grab their arm firmly and look them straight in the eye and talk to them in a very firm but low tone.<br>  <br>  And you make them listen to you and you remind them when they are misbehaving to stop, listen and obey, you do not let them have their way, they must earn their way. <br>  <br>  Teach them nicely, they don't need you to yell at them, they understand talking, not yelling.<br>  <br>  You have to teach them manners very young in life so that they will respect you and others and they will behave in public, no tantrums will be tolerated and do not give in to crying, stay firm. <br>  <br>  Sometimes time-out is good, just don't expect them to listen to you overnight if they are out of control, you need to practice every day how to talk to your kids to keep them under control.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't let them have their way, you are the parent, always in control, so don't give in.|`|eMUSTCQfaa	Even though its considered illegal you have to establish their respect.  I know beating you kids sound bad, but just establish a form of  superiority and dont lose the respect or else they will run you mad.  If they deserve a spanking, you have to do it.  Take my advice or leave it, but it has proven to work.|`|MLaYRGdcaa	THEY ARE TARGETED BY MEDIA,FOOD,TOY AND PRODUCT MARKETING GROUPS ,ETC AND INFLUENCED BY FRIENDS ON MATERIAL GOODS AND FADS WHICH IS EVER CHANGING.<br>  <br>  THEY ARE SO HYPED UP AND DISTRACTED BY ALL THOSE THINGS , THEREFOR YOU HAVE THE PROBLEMS THAT U AND OTHERS HAVE THE WORLD OVER.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	You have to be firm and follow through with the no!

Or you.|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	You have to be a parent and set guidelines and rules...then enforce them.  Children learn from example|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	Sounds like some spankings are in order.|`|pqOnERLWaa	As you can probably tell by the amount of response to your question, you have a very common problem.<br>  It has to be the hardest part of being a parent, because they are your children and you love them, and you never want to see them hurt by anyone. So what seems very difficult to say no and upset them. First you need to tell yourself that you are doing the right thing by controlling what they can and cant do, they will be much more hurt and disappointed if they learn they cant always get what they want from their peers as they get older. Children can be very cruel to other children, so by teaching your children to accept they cant always get their own way, prepares them for life without you, which is what being a parent is all about, teaching your kids how to be responsible adults or how to interact with peers is very important.<br>  I also find distracting them with colouring in, or food helps me to get half an hour of peace.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Good luck|`|LJfAhlJ6aa	Hi, I am not a parent but I been watching this show on TV... Emergency Nanny, where a trained professional intervenes to help parents eal with problems like that. There s a whole philosophy behind stuff like this so I think you need to do a bit more focused research.<br>  <br>  Something simple you could start off with: Gather the kids to tell them there will be a new set of rules (have rule book done with 3-4 main rules you would like them to follow) around the house with a reward and penalty system (attention: the rewards should not be materialistic). Depending on how old your kids are you can have like a big board with a star  award system on it (one star per rule for every-day of the week) whoever keeps all his stars on the board by the end of the week is the best. However misbehaves loses a star and so on. No shouting, no spanked bottoms, just remove a star. For cartoon watching for instance allow a certain time for them to watch TV, then they should do their homework, and then you should devote them some of your time (to play, read, generally spend time with them). Try to treat all kids equally an with respect.<br>  Hope this helps. Get the opinion of a specialist on these matter as well.|`|EKDqD0BNaa	because they don't take you seriously. if you say no and when they do it anyway they see there is a consequence, they'll learn when daddy says no he means no! About the tv, maybe limit tv time to where she doesn't watch any (too much tv bad for kids anyway) and when you watch it explain to her that it's "daddy's time" and she needs to let you have that like when you let her watch her shows. Kids learn by example.|`|16xFfHvuaa	you can't hope they "agree" with you.<br>  You don't owe them an explanation.<br>  you are the parent.<br>  quit trying to be "fair"<br>  They are typical children and only think of themselves.<br>  become a real"jerk"  <br>  they will be better for it when they mature.<br>  <br>  watch the "Dog Whisperer " on the History Channel with Ceasor Millon  he will show you how to assert yourself and be the leader of the pack.|`|XCk0IOQIaa	Here's a plausible reason: You're asking for parenting advice on Yahoo!

T9fek24eaa	The urine test strips they use at the doctors are usually less sensitive than the home pregnancy tests that you can buy at the drug store. I would recommend going and getting a pregnancy test with a higher sensitivity (First Response Early Results is the most sensitive on the market) and seeing what it says TODAY, before you take these pills. If you are indeed pregnant then the blood test will show it also. A blood test is the most accurate and sensitive of any. I would absolutely want to double check before I took some meds to induce a period. If it does not show on the blood test at the least, then you are not pregnant. <br>  <br>  Now, if you are not pregnant according to the blood test and a new hpt this is what it would sounds like to me. Sometimes when you ovulate, the egg will become fertilized and your body will start gearing up and producing hcg to get ready for the pregnancy, but the egg fails to implant OR it implants and it just stops developing. This is called a chemical pregnancy. Your period may only be a day or 2 late, but it can be up to 2 weeks late and you still have a chemical pregnancy. A tell tale sign of having a chemical pregnancy is testing before your period is due and getting a BFP and testing again a few days later and getting a BFN. Almost ALL women have this at some point in their lives, but most do not even know that it is happening. This is why most doctors do not recommend testing before your missed period (Dont worry I was peeing on hpt's at like 3dpo too!!!) <br>  <br>  The only thing I can tell you right now, is quit googling! Don't look up this stuff, it is going to drive you nutty and make you 10 times more stressed, go to bed and get ready for your beta tomorrow... only 4 hours after that and you will know for sure. Good luck hun! *hugs*|`|2jiNLOKHaa	first of all, if you are 16dop and nine days late that is a problem. you need at least a 10-11day leuteal phase for implantation and fertilization and everything to have time to work. that would mean that you have a 8 day leauteal phase. that is waaaayyy to short. anyway, back to your question....<br>  <br>  if you got a positive and now are getting negatives i would ask for a few beta hcg quantitative blood tests. if the hcg levels are doubling every 2-3 days then you are still pregnant and the hormones are rising. if your first level is above 2000 then you can get an ultrasound to see what is going on. an hcg level <2000 and you cant really see anything on ultrasound. i would waite and see about the blood tests first before you do anything with pills. make sure they do at LEAST two, and at least 48hours apart. then you can see if the levels are doubling or decreasing or what. not all miscarriages have the classic symptoms of spotting, cramping and clots. especially in early pregnancy. more than likely if you have miscarried then your body will just reabsorb it and your period will start shortly after. the pills are just to speed up the process. i hope it is a misdiagnosis. i am newly pregnant too and have had a lot of problems so far. it is scary not knowing if the baby is ok or not. i can imagine how you feel. hang in there and pray if you believe in that. i hope you can get things figured out soon. ((hugs))
yR5BhCAzaa	I don't know if I'd say overweight in an unhealthy way. Maybe in a "what's average/normal" kind of way.  As for the person who's nephew is almost 3 months old and 20+ lbs - wow. That's a big baby. I don't know why the doctor is ok with that.<br>  <br>  But honestly, once she learns to crawl and walk, she will likely thin up some. I would ask the doctor. If she's 6 months, you should have an appointment coming up.<br>  <br>  Generally, formula fed babies are plumper.|`|gUIhXGNeaa	My son just turned One a week ago. He is 30 inches long and weighs 24 pounds.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	It is not average, but my son was 21lbs at 6 months and completly healthy... so as long as her height and weight are about the same percentile them she is fine. babies are allowed to be chubby :)|`|436fREgIaa	if shes off the charts at her well visits..then yes,she is.but it also depends on height of you parents.if your super tall..then chaces are baby is saving up,and will grow tall.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	That's really good that your daughter is gaining weight like that. It's normal from my experience but at her next appointment don't be afraid to ask her pediatrician about her weight. There is nothing wrong with questions and being concerned about your child's weight or any other questions you may have about your child's health. I ask my daughter's doctor questions all the time. My daughter was 5lbs 14oz when she was born and  was very worried about her weight and I felt like it was my fault that she was so small but found out it was normal. Now she is 3 months old and is almost 12lbs and I still question her weight and she is only drinking formula cause I didn't produce any breast milk with her.  So don't be afraid to ask her doctor questions if you want to that's what they are there for. But her weight seems normal to me though. Your a good mother and I don't think that she is over weight at all.|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	It's a little big but not anything to worry about. My middle baby was really big as a baby and now she is 4 and very slim. I'm pretty sure that my 4 month old son is going to be that big if not bigger by then. He just turned 4 months old and already weighs 16-17 lbs and is in 6-9 month clothes. His doctor isn't a bit concerned. He only has 5 bottles a day, about 6 ozs each time so he isn't overeating. As long as they are growing and are healthy it really doesn't matter what they weigh or what size they are in.|`|4qrH4pVraa	Size skipping is VERY normal. <br>  <br>  As far as the weight issue goes, your baby eats/drinks as much as she needs. Thats a healthy weight and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. The only time to worry is if weight is impeding your baby's development cos she finds it hard to move! <br>  <br>  If you really are worried go see your clinic :)|`|LDHu66Vraa	She's not. My nephew is 3 months and 1 week tomarrow and he weighs 23 lbs.
eoL9PxPiaa	I would speak to your childs pediatrician, the nurse is right he should be gaining at this point, at our office we consider children below 45% malnourished and usually give a referral. Maybe you could take some herbal lactation pills to help your body to produce more.|`|GMQfejxKaa	Don't get discouraged, I'm having some similiar issues with my 8 month old, she only gained 5 ozs between 6 and 8 months. You could always try taking fenugreek to see if that will increase your supply. And continue to offer a bottle , but only after you have finished breastfeeding him. Good luck!|`|SM4xIodaaa	I am also not making enough milk... so frustrating that our bodies do not work the way we want them too. I found that many moms told me that all I have to do is breastfeed all day and my milk will increase. That did not work. I then tried Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle and that did not work and then i tried More milk plus and again... that did not work. I also tried pumping every 2 hours and that also did not work. =( I have tried it all. I am breastfeeding him and ending it with a 2-3 oz bottle. I am sorry to hear your breastfeeding is not working out as planned. You have done great to make it this far! So many moms give up after a few months. You are doing great!! Just give him some formula at the end of breastfeeding. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Amanda- it is not always true that the more you put your baby on you to bf the more milk you will produce.... I have tried for 2 months now and my body is just not working. It is so frustrating when people think all woman can bf and that it is as easy as 123... I wanted my baby strictly on breastmilk for 1 year and NO formula.... so to say that she "gave up" is the wrong attitude. She did not give up... she is still feeding him breastmilk as I am still feeding my baby breastmilk. That is far from giving up.|`|hKc6pKJmaa	I'm sorry to hear that you've given up on breastfeeding.  Really when your nursing, its very hard to underfeed your baby!  Of course he's going to seem to prefer a bottle b/c he's getting much more food at a faster pace but ultimately that is what is making your milk supply go down.  The more you feed him the more you'll produce.  There were times I fed my son and it seemed like he was still hungry so I'd feed him as often as I could. I also tried to make sure I was getting enough water and keeping my calories up.  Around 6mths I started him on cereal and fruits and that helped too.  <br>  Don't get discouraged!  Do what feels right for you but also make sure your doing a lot of research to make sure its the best thing for your baby.  In the end, breastfeeding will be the best for your baby but you have to make that choice in the end.  Just make it for him and not because your stressed. That will pass.  Don't give up! :)|`|AA10526033	16lbs at 6 months and they are worried? is he getting longer at all? My 6 month old weighs 13lbs and she is in the 75%...my oldest daughter weighed 16lbs at like 10 months my 2nd was over a yr. have you started cereals or baby food yet? if not ask the nurse at your next weigh in. My 2nd started falling off the charts at about 14 months and thats when they got concerned. what does your dr say?|`|1k6UUC8qaa	give hi formula and baby food forget the breast milk or don't make it the only or main food source for him you can deprive him of nutrients he need to develop and grow what are you waiting for
MPcKEdVQaa	LOL that is funny i don't know if they know the difference but im guessing they do!! my 7month old son cries and hides his face at boys or men,any man even my family but girls oh my gosh he is definately a ladies man, he smiles and talks and laughs even strangers but the thing i dont understand is he takes more to pretty girls??? work that out LOL|`|NXodF671aa	yes yes and yes - Our son has always migrated towards grandpa, papa, uncles, and just men in general. He's been that way since he was about 6 months old - I do think they distinguish between genders, and I think that they are just going with what is comfortable to them. Your baby seems to be a ladies man. Nothing wrong with it, and its' bull roar if anyone tells you it's because you spend too much time with him. Dont change anything, it's his preference right now - He'll get accustomed with time.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My son is 12 months old and has always preferred men over women. He gets along great with little boys but doesn't care for little girls at all. I'm not sure how they can tell the difference but I think they really can.<br>  <br>  Poor grandma, he is terrified of her still. I have no idea why but he is fine with grandpa.|`|X8zRD86Vaa	my son def is a ladies man. he smiles and giggles for the ladies and just gives the guys strange looks.. and he recently just met my friends daughter.. whose 5 days older the n him.. and was giving her googly eyes and even held her hand[[i held him to her carseat and he did it by himself]]
ksXayEUoaa	Tell her what she did that was wrong and why she's being punished.<br>  Take away her cd/mp3 players, tv, video games, internet, and after school program privileges for 1-2 weeks.<br>  Have her tell the boy, his parents, and her sister that she's sorry and why in person.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	Be good role models... children emulate their parents so fix yourself first or give your child up for adopotion to someone who is a good person.|`|oG6mNOLYaa	spare the rod and spoil the child. there's nothing wrong with disciplining a child under 6-years-old as long as you don't injure them or cause them any pain. if they're over 6, you don't need to resort to physical punishment, as talking to them will do the trick.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Start the beatings. Kids need discipline. If they don't get it, they get out of control. Do it now, before it's too late.
fkgruGHraa	I didnt get to my OB/GYN til i was 6 months pregnant thanks to my insurance..... my son is perfect... smarter than all the babies on this base. And I didnt even take the prenatal vitamins or do blood work...|`|kgcTdberaa	you need to go asap. i am 15 weeks and didnt have my first appt till i was 13weeks, when i called they got me in right away because i was so far along. its good that youre taking your prenatals but you need to go so the can draw blood and check on the baby and all that good stuff. do you have insurance? why havent you been?|`|mzz9Icdjaa	As far as the prenatal pills, I'd say as long as you have a healthy, balanced diet, you shouldn't be too worried. But as far as not seeing a doctor, you should really go just to make sure everything is kosher, especially since you have had a past miscarriage.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	Well I didn't see a Dr till I was about 20 weeks and my baby is healthy... But I do not have a history of miscarriage... Just take your vitamins.. Stay healthy and go to a Dr asap.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey darlin. You should be having regular visits & blood taken & check ups.<br>  It would be good that you do take prenatal vitamins because you need them every day throught pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Baby will be okay, But keep strong - Have your ultrasound at 18 - 22 weeks & blood test and everything.<br>  Im sorry about your past darling , But because of this - you should be having more checkups and monotoring. x I do hope that everything will be okay for you x Baby is most important - Keep strong<br>  <br>  God bless x|`|vKEYa8aeaa	unfortunatly yes you could be, but not because of the prenatal vitamins. prenatal vitamins are GREAT for all of your pregnancy, but are really made for the third trimester and are made for the mother to get nutrients she needs, because the baby takes all the nutrients it needs. i didnt take my prenatals until the end of my second trimester bc they made me sick and my baby is healthy, fine, and measures 2 weeks ahead of his LMP due date. the reason you could be putting your baby at risk is that you havent gotten the testing done that is done in early pregnancy to screen for things that you may need medication or special instruction with. you also need to be getting a u/s in about 1 or 2 weeks to make sure the baby is growing okay and everything is normal. i know you may be scared because of what happened last time, but you really should start getting prenatal care for your health and the babys. good luck!|`|KYdg8tpUaa	Yes, you should definetly see a doctor asap..i mean people have gone through a whole pregnancy and not knowned they were pregnant and everything turned out ok. But, the fact is you just never know..you need to go and make sure everything is ok with the baby and yourself. Its very very important to seek prenatal care as early as possible..and take the prenatal vits everday to make sure yourbaby is getting everything he/she needs..|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	if you've had problems in the past you really should be doing everything you can to keep this pregnancy healthy. you definetly need prenatal care even try going to a local doctor it's better then nothing.they can probably organise an ultrasound for you to go to and that will tell you if the babys ok.<br>  good luck|`|sVn0Sy7taa	yeh its a HUGE problem because u have a history or miscarriage.... ANYTHING could be happening..|`|B0bWrvanaa	You definitely need to go to the doctor bc when you have a miscarriage bc of premature water breaking you are considered high risk for another pregnancy. If you didn't, I would say it doesn't matter bc I know plenty of people that don't get prenatal care and the vitamins are only a supplement that I stopped taking during my 7th month bc i hated the way it made my urine cloudy.<br>  Are you not going bc youre scared that you are having another miscarriage and don't want to face it? You'll only get more attatched to the baby and make things worse if you dont catch up on it. Plus you will gain some sleep not having to worry about it.|`|rDw9N09iaa	because you have a history of having a miscarriage i really think that you should go ahead and find you a doctor asap so you can go ahead and get an ultrasound done and stuff like that to make sure the baby is growing fine. i didnt start taking prenatal vitamins until i was about 13 or 14 weeks, and when i went in at 16 weeks for an ultrasound everything looked great. my baby had a great spine, body growth, and everything. congrats!|`|yNoENquTaa	since you have had a miscarriage previously it is possible that you are now a high risk pregnancy.<br>  and not taking prenatal vitamins is ok to. billions upon billions of people have not had them and had many healthy children. however it is important that you go to the doctor soon and have an ultrasound done at 18 weeks.<br>  <br>  edit: you'll also need to book into a hospital or birthing centre soon.|`|3w7VztEWaa	ya I'm 21 weeks pregnant and havn't gone to see the doctor yet.<br>  But it's only because i can't apply for medicaid. my parents income was higher in 07 than 08 and they havn't filed thier 08 tax returns so I don't qualify.<br>  I thought that being married would  cancel out my parents income and only focus on me and my husband but it doesn'y.<br>  So I have to wait til my parents file and everything is taking so long.<br>  it's ridiculous. but I'm taking my vitamins Doc just does check ups and blood test not like he's going to cause the baby to be healthy or not. just take your vitamins and don't do anything that can cause a miscarriage and you'll be fine.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	I didn't go til about that time either. I am now 35wks along and everything is fine. This may sound stupid, but I didn't go because I just didn't know exactly what to do. It's my first baby, I had no insurance, didn't know if I had to call a obgyn, women's clinic, or maternity ward in the hospital. I had no clue about planning for a baby, however eventhough I didn't take prenatals I did take regular monthly vitamins every day. I have since been put on medicaid ( they pay for everything ) and everything is great.|`|AA10967880	for starters you should start on prenatal vitamins to help with preventing birth defects and to help the foetus develop correctly. i would seek medical assistance now specially to get your first scan. if you are pretty big you might have twins and you need to know if they are healthy or not. they can do tests now for down syndrome and stuff.<br>  <br>  i don't think you are doin too much harm as im sure there is heaps of women out there who don't take vitamins. you are increasing your chances of the risk but you are out of the danger zone. as long as you are taking care and eating healthy you should be right but i would seek medical advice just to ensure everythin is healthy and the way it  should be.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Um well not enough folic acid has been linked to birth defects, not sure about miscarriage.<br>  I am not trying to be mean but why would you risk it? I am just wondering what could me more important than the baby in you?<br>  You may be further along than you think you are, you should go to the doctor immediately! They need to do an ultrasound to make sure that there hasn't been any damage done by a lack of prenatal care, what your due date will be, and they might even be able to tell you the gender now. There are also tests that you are about to be too late to take, and you should have had blood tests and urine tests done to check for things that could cause you to miscarry or have birth defects.<br>  Please begin to take a prenatal vitamin. They are most beneficial in the first trimester, but they are still good. You can get one in the vitamin aisle at WalMart, you do not have to have a prescription one. Most doctors will tell you to start taking them as soon as you find out you are pregnant.<br>  I hope things go ok. You may have opened the door for birth defects. And I am not trying to be mean, just inform you of the negative things that Could happen. Hopefully, things are great!  Good Luck!|`|QFjbbkHJaa	if you have had a history of miscarriges, and you are planning to keep this one alive and healthy along with keeping yourself alive and healthy, then i highly suggest you go to the doctor. asap.|`|azE51WGRaa	I know how hard it can be to get prenatal care, especially when every doctor seems to be booked solid for months (ugh). Just try to get care ASAP (easier said than done, I know). Because you did have a miscarriage before, especially under the circumstances that you did, it's best to be safe than sorry and get the care in case something happens again (not saying it will, but just in case). Do you have maybe a community pregnancy center you could go to (I live in Reno,NV and here we have the pregnancy center, which is where I go because I'm poor and on medicaid =D ). If anything, find the doctor who is less booked and get an appointment with him. Good luck with your baby! I wish you the best =D

AjqO1aJgaa	Can she say it if she concentrates?<br>  <br>  Loads of kids mispronounce letters at that age. My son said "l" for "r" until he was nearly 9. He was in speech therapy for a stutter at the time and the therapist was completely unconcerned by it, she said he'd grow out of it (the l/r thing). He did.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do for a kid who's a bit incomprehensible is to talk slower to them. If you slow down, they slow down, and the more time they have the more likely they are to pronounce things better :)|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	if you- ah fwum Woad Island or Bwookland ..you nevah have to use it|`|0SIhrYCbaa	If she's 7, then that is second grade age and it is a problem.

There were a few others but all corrected with minimum of muss and fuss by third grade.|`|BRT2teSqaa	She needs speech therapy! Usually that begins in kindergarten.  She should be able to pronounce R by now.  She has a speech impediment, but it can be fixed with help.|`|AA10943329	by age 7 she should have the letter R.

They have guidelines on when it is normal for a child to say certain sounds. Until that time you can try to work with her or take her to someone privately.

DgXmTJzYaa	no if she doubles it she would  have the risk of having really huge painful cysts. The only thing that changes with increased dosage is the size of the egg released. If you increase the dosage the egg will be over mature or create a huge cyst or to many cysts. Let the doctor do their job. Also, the risk associated with twins is huge. Twins are almost always premature which obviously comes with complications. why would any mom wish for that? my friend his permanatly brain damaged and crippled due to complications during birth  and he was a twin. 50mg 100mg 150 mg all have the same chance of conceiving multiples. its 10% no matter what the dosage. So just stick with the normal amount.|`|Kl5kN2Qaaa	i think nooo she shouldnt double the dosage..the doc would try her on the dosage she is on and if that doesnt work then he or she will slowly increase her dosage..it can b very risky to double it regardless if u can concive twins or not, y put urself at  risk and lose everything

My brothers in Pre-K and he is learning colors, numbers, and the alphabet. The teacher should review and send home small worksheets to practice in the first few months of school. Going into kindergarten, your child needs to know basic things.
WMPqVYe1aa	its all so confusing, we want them to walk & then we are trying to stop them, next we want them to talk then we tell them to be quiet.  try and find her a new spot for meal times, does she have a small table and chair set, make it fun and get her to help set her table by putting a table cloth or place mat on, maybe if you sit with her.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	is she still being fed or is she feeding herself? (if you're still trying to feed her, that may be an issue)<br>  <br>  honestly, i'd offer her food at certain times during the day, and if she's hungry, she'll eat. if not, wait until the next time rolls around. don't worry about her eating, they don't need as much food as you might think, and as long as she's offered food several times a day, she'll eat as much as she needs. don't force it or she may develop food issues later.|`|PfP8LSF6aa	My mom said I would never eat in my highchair when I was younger. She said that she would always have to feed me in the sink under the window, lol that was like the only place I would eat. Maybe your daughter just needs to find that 1 spot too eat at. Explore different things with her, be creative with the food and you feeding it too her. Don't ever put her in front of the tv, that just ruins things for her later on. Never give in too her tantrums, when she throws one tell her that if she does it 1 more time then she is not going to play later, or that your going to put her into time out. But you have to keep enforcing it. I know it's hard and all, but your the mom not her, And you need to teach her that.|`|af96mcl1aa	My son is at that same stage. What i usually try to do is give him some finger foods (crackers, cheetos, cereal) while i'm feeding him. He seems to not get as ancy(SP?) then when his hands and mind have something to focus on. Also I turn on the cartoons, and that seems to help a lot too. I wouldn't give in, especially at this age, because they are a lot smarter then they look, and they know how to take advantage of you.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|DS21ekeJaa	At 18 months, my kids all ate the same time the rest of the family did and they fed themselves. Yes, it got messy a bit and if they threw food it got taken away for a few minutes, but they rarely did it for very long. <br>  .<br>  I suppose I have always felt that while they want to explore their abilities, there also has to be limits placed on what is explored. We sit down together for meals, and that is the way it is. If they want to get up and walk away, they are done eating. I did not ever run after them to get them to eat, nor do we watch TV while eating(only special pizza and movie nights!) And I will brag that they have good table manners and eating habits. I would not be embarassed to take them anywhere for a meal, and it started when they were very young.|`|hieQHR0daa	Tantrums happen because the child is frustrated. They do not have enough language to tell you the problem. The best way to deal with a tantrum is to ignore it. Do not look at or speak to your child while she is having her tantrum. Pay no attention unless she is in an unsafe place or likely to cause herself injury. (If this is the case remove her from danger and let her get on with it.) As soon as she is well behaved again praise her. <br>  You can tell her at the start that she should stop her tantrum now and should ..speak in a nice voice, sit down...whatever. You can even say, ok, this behavior is not acceptable and put her in time out. You may need to use time out a few times before the message sinks in.<br>  Giving her attention when she misbehaves is only "rewarding" the unwanted behavior.<br>  <br>  Tantrums are normal in children over 12 months.They become less common in 3-4 year old and are not a problem when you understand what's happening and ignore it.
856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Haha...yeah, "man" you sound like it.  (NOT)  Girls your age are very fickle.  They like you one day and the next day they are flirting with your best friend.  Just the way it goes.  Never take girls too seriously when you are young.  You'll only be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|kRaVa0Wraa	how about you ask her?|`|6sEKNJ7Laa	if she acts strangley around you, blushes, laughs a lot (warning- she could be showing off to you that she doesnt like or need you with thiis) if she gazes at you, is especially nice to you, laughs at your un-funny jokes, or constantly praises u she probably likes u.
WelEvYwGaa	1. Get a drug test. Search his room for hidden drugs.<br>  <br>  2. If anything send him to a rehab center or boot camp. If you can convince your husband. That you and him need "us" time.<br>  <br>  3.Start setting curfews and if he doesn't start going to school and raising grades to at least C's or B's.<br>  <br>  All his stuff gets taken away! Thrown in the garbage or just hidden in the attic. Two pairs of clothes a week. That he has to wash himself.<br>  This what my dad used to threaten me with when I didn't clean my room.<br>  <br>  4. As soon as he disrespects you make him start doing some form of academic work.<br>  <br>  <br>  Obviously, the kid is trying to ruin everyone's happiness. Time to start ruining his fun.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, you cannot force him to stop talking crap.<br>  <br>  You need to look at his perspective...his mom is a drug addict and his dad found someone new.It is hard on him.<br>  <br>  Mix in hormones and the fact that he can take advantage of his dads ability of being a pushover..there you go.<br>  <br>  You and your husband need to sit the kid down and talk about his issues.Medication is ridiculous.It will not help the situation...it will only mask it.<br>  <br>  The fact is, you guys need to talk to the kid.Perhaps he doesn't think he gets the attention he deserves from his father and is acting out?<br>  <br>  Getting a divorce because of this will do you nothing.His child comes first and this is something you needed to realize when you walked into the picture.However, the father also needs to take responsibility.Perhaps spending one day a week with his son will help improve his attitude.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Its sad that you are both allowing a 13 year old boy to come between your marriage.  I am not saying that to be rude I just want you to stop blaming your husband or the kid and realize that its a failure on both you and your husbands part that the marriage is close to divorce.  I recommend seeing a counselor as a family and possibly a marriage counseling as well.  I think that when we are angry, we say things that the other person may not take seriously simply because it was said in anger. Counseling helps issues to be talked about in a calm controlled environment.  Your husband has to understand that he needs to take responsibility for his son and his behavior.. that he cant let a 13 year old run his life like his son is doing.  You need to realize that no matter what, his son will come first and if forced to choose he will choose his son.  My husband is my daughters step-dad and if she was behaving the same as your stepson, I would be crushed if he said he was leaving if my daughter didn't shape up.  It seems your issue may not be so much with the child but the way your husband is handling it, that's why I recommended family counseling.  Maybe he would more willing to hear it from someone else.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope everything works out.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	You can't do anything. This kid doesn't want to be happy so he won't be happy.<br>  <br>  You have to make a choice, continue to live this way or leave. You are not going to convince your hubby to be a man and raise his son to be a man, he's feeling too much guilt over this to do the right thing for his son.|`|PeI5rpK1aa	Put yourself in you stepsons shoes. He was living with an addict at 8 years old. Who knows what he saw. Truama can set kids on a bad path.<br>  As for the chores, maybe offer him a little pocket money for doing it if you don't already. Even $5 a week. This will make him a little happier. If not, review how many chores he has to do, and how much homework he gets. Does he have much free time after that? Maybe reduce how many chores he has to do.  As for Dad, see if instead of having drinks, maybe once or twice a week you can schedual some quality time for them to play sport or talk about what's bothering him. <br>  Your husband is probably letting him get away with things because of what he went through with his mum. Parents often feel guilty about not getting the kid away sooner, putting them through a divorce and many other things so they excuse bad behaviour to try to make up for it in a way.<br>  <br>   Take him out on more family outings, talk to him more than you do, give him pocket money if you already dont. Make his room nicer.  And even if you already do all of these things and always have, do them more so he realises your making an effort to make him happy where he is and hopefully wont rebel so much because he will be happy where he is.<br>  <br>   Bottom line, and I know I'm repeating this, teens brains aren't yet wired to be reasonable, so your going to have to make a big effort, be the good guy and keep calm and assertive even when he's a brat and keep consistant. Talk to you husband and start disiplining him, reward him and both you and your husband schedual (kids don't like to be caught off guard ) regular talks with him once or twice a week with him for a set amount of time-Almost like a shrink session where he can tell you how he's feeling (about his mum, school, friends, girls) without ramifications, and you can do the same. You will find out what's bothering eachother and you may even be able to help eachother out. He may not be willing to talk at first, if he wont, maybe you can tell him what's bugging you first, he may feel more comfortable that way. Or you could take him out for ice-cream or an arcade or somewhere he will enjoy to have the talks. During the talks find out if you or your husband have a common interest with him. Say you both like art, take a class together and try and bond more with him. If he likes you, he'll be nicer.  Go on outings to parks, go rollerskating, to the cinema, try and do something different each weekend. It will keep him off the streets, away from bad influences, he'll enjoy and and you might too . He's acting out to get attention (he's never been taught the right way to get it, and for these kids, attentions attention, it doesn't matter if it's positive or negative, they just want there parents to talk to them) and he's also acting out so you will give up and let him move out.It will be a big sacrifice at first and a lot of work but if you make it more pleasant for him to live with you he will stop acting out, same as giving him more attention.  Therefore by making him happy first, you will be happy. For better or worse remember. Don't let a kid rip apart your marriage.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  (As for skipping school, if he's happier this may stop. But make this one of your topics of discussion.  He may be skipping because he's getting bullied, because the work is too hard for him(some kids skip because it's too easy)or because his friends do. Talk to his teacher, find out who he hangs out with at school and how they behave, invite them over and find out more about them. If they're a bad influence something must be done, but that's the hard part and he will resent it.)|`|Z5rIQE7Gaa	You are in a really tough situation. <br>  <br>  The people who say that a son comes before a wife are wrong. The spouse needs to come first whether in an original or blended family or the marriage won't succeed.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest Christian counseling for you and your husband. If your husband doesn't discipline him it will lead to even more trouble. He is not helping his son, but hurting him by refusing to discipline.<br>  <br>  You can't make the son like you. I'd try to treat him as best you can, but I'd feel free to stay away from him, spend time in your room or out with friends or relatives from time to time to maintain your sanity.<br>  <br>  His father can have some one on one time with him and you can be around some people who actually like you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't take it personally that he doesn't like you. I'm sure that you are a very nice person and that this boy would hate whoever his stepmom was. That doesn't make it any easier I know.|`|ksXayEUoaa	He obviously needs attention and only knows how to get it the wrong way. Keep taking him out for fun bonding things (soccer games, paintball...) and make sure he gets some one-on-one dad time too. He's normal and needs help. All he's thinking is that his mom was taken away and now he's stuck with a father that wasn't there before and his wife that doesn't want him there. He's just as insecure as you.<br>  <br>  You want to divorce because you don't feel like dealing with his child? Sounds like you have the problems. You're suddenly a mother so act like one.<br>  <br>  "You can't take it anymore." What are you? 13?<br>  You gave a vow of for better or worse. If you didn't mean better AND worse than you should've thought of that before.

fNv2Re6baa	GIRLS:<br>  <br>  Natalie Cadence Nicole is pretty. I like it because it is feminine and mature. <br>  <br>  Natalie Jerica Rane is gorgeous, however, I would probably spell Rane as Raine. Either way, it's a really pretty name.<br>  <br>  Natlie Clair Shae is so adorable! I love the name Shae, especially as a middle name! <br>  <br>  All your girls names are so beautiful! My favourite out of the three would have to be......Natalie Clair Shae. You said we can mix around names? Well, even more perfect would be Natalie Jerica Shae. This isn't on your list, but my favourite girls name would have to be <br>  'Emilee-Kate Rose' (Emilee-Kate first name, Rose, middle) I generally prefer it when the middle name is smaller than the first name. If there is two middle names, than if they are each smaller (eg. Clair is shorter than Natalie and Shae is shorter than Natalie). I'm not sure why, but it just sounds nicer I think. <br>  <br>  BOYS:<br>  Brayden James Hugh is sweet. I especially love Brayden. James is classic yet mature and Hugh is......different. <br>  <br>  Levi James Hugh is great too. Levi is very uncommon, however, I do like it.<br>  <br>  Skyler James Hugh is......alright. Not a personal favourite of skyler, but hey, he's your kid. <br>  <br>  Dayton James Hugh - I've never heard of Dayton before but I love it! I must add it to my list of favourites. <br>  <br>  Brycen James Hugh - I like it. Brycen is so much nicer than just plain Bryce. <br>  <br>  My favourite name on your list has to be Dayton or Levi James Hugh. I like them both equal. My all-time favourite boys name is Christopher Thomas or Christopher Matthew.<br>  <br>  All your names are great and I wish you and your husband both the best for the new baby.

WvqRJow1aa	My cousin did the same as an infant. In fact, he would bang his head on the floor too. Being much younger then, I found it quite amusing. But I believe he was discouraged from doing it by reproaches from my granny. It may work for you too.|`|UXuSI6EZaa	the skullcap bones of an infant are fragile and are still separated (not fused enough to fully cover the brain). if you can't prevent her from doing what she's doing, mount pillows on the sides of her playpen to cushion the impact. get inputs from her pediatrician asap. good luck|`|vxoWXVLKaa	I would talk to the doctor as it could be something more serious, but many children will continue to do things that get them attention whether it hurts or not.  Not to say that you aren't showing her attention, but it is probably interesting to her that when she does it, it cues you to rush to her.  If the doctor says that there isn't anything seriously wrong, the best bet is to ignore the behavior to see if she stops when she doesn't get the reaction she is looking for.|`|0rjKnY7Eaa	my daughter is 14 months old, I was really concerned because after she got out of the hitting other people stage, she began hitting herself, if i tell her no , or stop  ....or if shes confused, or just to make people laugh because she gets a reaction out of it, it then progressed to hitting her head off of the ground and other things out of frustration. I brought her to the doctor and he told me shes too young to do anything, and all i can do is try to be sure she doesnt hurt herself. We have carpet at home, but my sister has tiles, and when she does it at my sisters house she actually bruises her head. I felt helpless when my doctor told me theres nothing i can do, but he was right, i stopped reacting, and if she did start doing it, i put her in her playpen and walked away. She hasnt done it in over a week now, so fingers crossed!  btw...make sure no one is laughing at her even if she is happy, as amusing as it may be to watch the child will feed off of the reaction|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	my daughter is 10 months, she doesnt hit herself with her hands like she is purposly trying to do so, but she does bang toys up and down and has whacked herself pretty good a couple of times. she even has  a little bruise to show for it. poor peanut.|`|jLnhnDjhaa	go to the doctors!!!!!!|`|nb8XUW0naa	uhh yea ithat is kinda something to keep on eye on.my mom had the same problom with my baby brother.see when he got upset he would beat his head on the coffie table and would knock himself silly.finalymy mom had it and when he did it again she whooped him|`|oMEozEMfaa	get her eyesight checked!
2jiNLOKHaa	37 weeks is term. you might get your little bundle a bit early is all. if the pain gets worse or the bleeding gets worse go to the er. if you can hang in there till you dr apt. in the am it will be the cheapest for you. if you feel any leaking fluid also go. you can always call the dr on call and see what she thinks. you can also call up to labor and delivery at the hospital the dr works at and talk to one of the nurses. they are great at advice and don't mind talking to you. do what makes you comfortable.|`|lmk3mKJgaa	start timing the pains to see how far apart they are and how long they last. if you can get through the night then wait but if you would fell better call the dr and talk to him or her and see what they say. you could be getting ready to have your lil one. good luck!!|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Bright red, I would say go up to L/D now, thats what my doc has been telling me, instead of just waiting on him to get to the office.

Any bright red blood should cause concern. Good luck, hope everything is ok!|`|AA10953561	It could be your "bloody show." Which is basically caused by your cervix starting to dilate. The cervix is swollen with blood during pregnancy, so when it starts to dilate the blood vessels burst and cause a little (or a lot) of blood to leak. If it's just a little blood, I wouldn't panic just yet. If at any point you notice a clear liquid leaking out you should head to labor and delivery. It could be your water breaking. If your stomach pains become really bad, or if you notice regular contractions you should probably head to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Being at 37 weeks you are considered full term. Since you've lost your mucus plug and are now having some spotting, I'm guessing labor is pretty near, but I'm not a doctor and can't say for sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon!
hKc6pKJmaa	unfortunately I had to deal with my MIL and HER mother b/c my husbands grandmother is still alive (at 94 and still as bossy as ever!).  I understand the rocky situation coming up though at times when it's your turn to be "in charge".  A wedding is a little easier to be compromising but you are the mommy and what you say goes!  Especially b/c she's not really involved in the day-to-day things, it may make it easier for you to kindly tell her to back off when she starts getting overbearing.  More than anything, stand your ground now when you feel her overstepping her boundaries.  It gets harder once your little one gets here.  I'm still working on issues with my in laws.  I've learned it's a moment by moment balance of knowing when to let something go b/c it's not worth it and when to speak up.  Your gut will tell you the difference! Good luck!|`|X8zRD86Vaa	believe it or not i think having the baby made me and the mother in law closer. we really didnt talk and she kinda gave me mean looks and stuff like that..but now we have common ground to talk about and stuff like that so we are closer|`|elx4NP4xaa	My mother in law never visits with my new baby. She hated the name I picked out for my baby  and she has always hated me too.  She is not a very nice person. I feel its her lose not mine.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	My mother in law hates me, but seems to put aside her hate now for the fact that Hunter (my son) is in the picture. She threatened to kill me on our wedding day, wouldn't talk to my husband for months afterwards, when I got pregnant she refused to believe the baby was my husbands (I've never even been with anyone else, so that would be impossible), she has even made a voodoo doll of me (my husband's parents are divorced--he and his father's side aren't crazy). She's truly nuts. However, now that Hunter is around, she sends outfits, emails me that she hopes I am doing well with my husband deployed, and even has a picture of our wedding (she didn't attend) on her Myspace page. I have been lucky enough she hasn't offered me parenting advice, but I only think it's because she lives so far away..|`|aEpPt9koaa	Before I got pregnant the relationship with my inlaws was beyond non existent, we couldn't stand each other and were not on speaking terms for about 6 months before our daughter was born. His mother was extremely mean to me and the day she was balantly disrespectful towards me I told her to never speak to me again until she could treat me with respect and she didn't until she found out I was pregnant. Once she knew she had a grandchild coming she was extra nice to me and was always asking if there was anything she could do for me. Now we get along great but I will never forget how she treated me in the beginning.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I carried the first grandchild for my mother-in-law...<br>  She was ecstatic i have to say. I got really close to her during my pregnancy too, I also had problems with my partner and she has stuck by my side throughout everything.<br>  I was pretty lucky, the only little problem i had was spoiling my daughter, giving her chocolate and coffee...ugh...<br>  As soon as i told her and put my foot down though she stopped that. She has always respected my boundaries, no matter what they were and i respect her for that.<br>  <br>  It may be your MIL but i would definitely talk to your husband about it.

She doesnt have a lot to do with him, and she doesnt tell me things bc when she would I would nip it in the butt right then and there. She actually tells people how much she thinks I'm a good mom which really is shocking. But she is a lot like that, she thinks its her way and only her way and if she doesnt get her way she throws a fit and pouts. I just stick to my guns and dont give in. I figure its my child and what I think is best is best. And if she doesnt like it then she will get over it or not thats her problem. Most of the time she will come around if she is happy or not lol

LisP31O8aa	Foster child care and adoption carry more issues than most people realize.  My heartfelt advice is to do more study and research before you even consider it and not this soon with a natural born child of your own.  Read the books on attachment disorders - we worked with Rick Delaney and Terry Levy and read the books also.  Fostering changes is the title or something close to that.  Immensely helpful and informative.  A true must read.  <br>  <br>  These children don't come into the child welfare system from great backgrounds - most of them are products of abuse of all varieties, many have spent 9 months in a drug and alcohol drenched womb and it has forever impacted their ability to think, learn, behave, and to live their lives.  Few of them have rocket scientists for natural birth parents either and they don't have normal/high i. q. 's or are absolutely mentally dull, even retarded to various degrees, -  sometimes that doesn't show up  clearly until they enter school.<br>  <br>  That fellow who had a female teen foster home was so so lucky.  Friends of ours did but they were in court more than out of it and had expensive attorneys fees because the girls accused the males of abusing them - a father and also one of the sons. That was the life they had come out of and what they knew.  Another home was and is considered one of the best and most reputable shelter home for girls and their babies that exist in our city but - - let me just tell you.  <br>  <br>  We were at a picnic at a park called Parrot Jungle and we saw that foster father hiding in some bushes making out sexually with one of his teen girls living with them in foster care.   We met the wife on a path on the other side and she was looking for him and asking for him, if we had seen him.<br>    <br>  I will remember that day forever.  That guy didn't see us, I don't think, but we saw them.  I didn't report him because it would have been useless.  They would both have denied it, it couldn't be proven, and the wife would have never believed us.  It would have wounded the wife horribly and it would have just been a senseless mess for them all.  I was hoping that that he'd get caught and convicted somehow but he never did that I know of. <br>  <br>  The challenges and traumas of caring for foster children can take a terrible toll on your life and lifestyle.  You need to know what you're doing and have an understanding about it.  I suggest you join the Guardian ad Lit ems, or what ever they are called where you are, for a year or more and work in the child welfare system before you consider taking any placement yourselves.  I give this advice from the heart.|`|2wyDALHgaa	If you feel moved to do it then now is as good a time as any to get started.  It will no doubt take time to get things in order and all I can suggest you do is not take on too much too soon after your son was born.  You still need time to tend to his needs and to continue to bond so take that time and then when you want, get started on fostering and eventually adopting.  You are young and there is no hurry.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, your son is only seven months old, and you are both young-enjoy this moment.  Wait a bit longer before rushing into fostering, i know of a few families where their parents were always fostering and the biological kids felt like they were left out because these kids came from various backgrounds of neglect & abuse- so there parents gave them a lot of attention that they needed.  Also the older children felt a bit like a full time babysitter.<br>  You might even have more children of your own without fertility, it has happened.|`|djZQXxmhaa	If i were you i would enjoy my son now.  If you have other children in the home you wont be able to give your son undivided attention and may miss some of the first things he does.  Think about it long and hard and if you still want to be a foster paretn i would wait until your son is older.  It's not fair to him right now he needs you.  He didnt ask to be here you brought him into this world and its up to you to provide the best care you can give him right now.  Having one child is hard enough but bringing in another child while your son is still so young is extremely hard.|`|Fc7xAdeEaa	That's exactly how and why my wife and I started being foster parents.  We started out wanting little ones, but there was a huge need for teen girls.  So we fostered teen girls for 12 years.  Started in 96 and we had our first daughter in 2001 (fertility treatments as well).  Now we have 3 biological kids and no more foster kids.  Well, that live with us, anyway.  Most are now in their 20s (one is 30 ... damn that makes me feel old ... I'm only 39!!!) and the ones we have contact with still call us their mom and dad.  <br>  <br>  It was very challenging, frustrating, emotional .... and oh so rewarding.  I wouldn't have changed a thing.  Teen girls were great!|`|nSva5cblaa	im 20 have a lil 8mon baby girl and ive thought about it to but i think u should wait and see cuz ur baby needs you so jst give him the attention he needs n i think u will be fine ur still young
7GDSgxagaa	As long as your baby is interested in the world and moving, go with it  If she isn't sitting up by 8 months, then you might need to have her physically evaluated to make sure nothing is keeping her from sitting up....  but since crawling is more complicated then walking, i wouldn't worry too much.|`|GKGvRuHzaa	Well, every baby have a different period when she/he can sit, crawl even walking. My daughter consider late in doing that, she start can crawl around but she could not bale to sit that time in 7 month but that time my daughter teeth already 4 teeth and she can speak good. And she could be able to walk in 1 and half years while other baby could be able to walk in 1 years old.|`|VB7RL0Jsaa	Crawling and not sitting up is pretty rare... But not definitely bad.  Infact, it may be good. It may just be that your baby is ready to get moving and doesn't want to sit around! haha.. There is nothing to worry about. The fact that she is crawling is great.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|EHkVVpfvaa	For all of our well baby appts we fill out this survey.  It will give you a good idea of the norms.<br>  DOnt panic if she doesn't do everything on the list yet!<br>  <a href="http://www.youthclinic.com/ASQ_PDF/06%20Month%20Questionnaire.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.youthclinic.com/ASQ_PDF/06%20...</a>|`|hi9SYnrraa	babies develop skills at different times. some never crawl and go straight to walking. its not always something the parent is doing|`|5Np8w5MCaa	Not every baby will sit up on there own by 6 months.  My oldest couldn't sit by herself till around 8 months.  She will sit when she is ready.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	there is no prob with her not sitting yet, i wouldn't think he would be seeing it for the first time.....lots of babies concentrate on one thing at the time, and she is focused on crawling from the sounds of it....|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Your baby crawls, but can't sit up yet? <br>  <br>  That's a little different. It's not like your doctor can yell at you or put you on punishment, as long as she's healthy, then it should go well.|`|AA10526033	There is a big difference in can't and doesn't want too. Physically she probably could if you made her. I have to force my 6 month old to sit by bending her physically at the belly and placing a toy in front of her or on her legs. Otherwise she also wants to just roll and army crawl around. Your dr will ask about it and just tell them the truth, you've tried and she doesn't want too and ask for advice. Your dr can show you how/what to do.|`|AA11920812	Babies never do what you want, lol. They all develop differently and there is nothing wrong with crawling before sitting. The main concern is that they are engaging with the outside world. And, crawling is a big accomplishment! Especially so early.<br>  <br>  My youngest could crawl before sitting. He was a chubby baby and I think he had balance issues. He still does at two, but is better. I wouldn`t worry about it at all!! He`s only six months! Sounds like he`s got things figured out for himself - on his own time schedule. :)))|`|436fREgIaa	if she crawls..shes fine..but do have her sit with support behind her about 1/2 inch away from her back.(lots and lots of pillows),sit on the floor,and play.everytime she goes to tip.say "up".and seat her right,and continue to be silly and play.eventually,she will pull herself forward with her body wieght.some kids arent as quick as others.its not a big deal.some pediatricians are pickier than others.my son didnt sit up on his own until 8 months..he kept tipping backwards.while my other child was 6 months,the other 7.its ok.dont panick.just play and teach and do it in a fun way.|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	I wouldn't worry too much, especially since your baby is crawling well.. She'll come around. Every baby is different.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	My son had a similar experience.  You need to see a neural surgeon, ASAP.  Have your pediatrician send you to get a emergency CAT scan. Be stern, let them know you will not accept anything but one.<br>  <br>  He may have excess brain fluid or Hydrocephalus.  My son as extra fluid but not enough to harm him.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/hydrocephalus2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/h...</a>|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would get a 2nd opinion asap; that doesn't sound right...|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Get a second first thing tomorrow. Any doctor should be able to see him. It is ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry especially when dealing with a baby. Good Luck & God Bless.
243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	How do you pronounce it?  <br>  <br>  Da-vin-ee?  Or Davi-nay?  It looks vaguely French but has no accents... really odd.  It reminds me of divining.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Dont really like it sounds made up ut  it is not too out there not the worse I have heard|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sounds cute.  Never heard of Davinee before but it's nice.|`|DO3grY10aa	I didn't find Davinee listed at three different sites.

AA10526033	6 hrs is really good. Not all babies sleep through the night for awhile. My first didn't until she was about 8 months, 2nd was about 4 months and 3rd has been since about 2-3 months. All babies are different!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	six hours is very normal; he should also be napping during the day....a lot of ppl consider six hours to be sleeping through the night|`|rFtKFp03aa	It is possible... My babies were sleeping through the night at 3-4 months ( and by that I mean 12 hours straight not going in their room at all ) <br>  <br>  We just consistently stretched out their night time feedings.. and if they woke up one night early ( and we knew they weren't hungry ) we just let them re settle and within a minute or so were back to sleep... <br>  <br>  We made sure they got lots of food and good naps during the day and just stretched their night time sleep and at an easy and comfortable rate for them ... <br>  <br>  It does vary though.. I heard people say they sleep 12 hours at 5 days and others have 3 year olds who still wake up ...|`|IGwX328eaa	6 hours is normal my son is 11 months and still wakes up at night he will grow out of it|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my son is 4 1/2 months and wake up every 2 hours during the night to eat. i try keeping him up more but he still wakes up|`|AA11920812	At that age when parents say sleeping through the night, they only mean 5-6 hours. :))) LOL. I remember mine when they were that age. Five hours felt like a good nights sleep.|`|7GDSgxagaa	It is totally normal for your baby to sleep only 5 to 6 hrs at night and take naps during the day.  five hours is considered sleeping through the night!!!!!!!!!!!!!   If your baby is not napping and only sleeping 6 hrs total, then i'd talk to your peditrician.  Otherwise, be happy to have such a good baby.<br>  <br>  Remember that people asking if your baby is a good baby and sleeps through the night is just a question like, when are you going to get married, then when are you going to have another kid.  It's just the cultural dialogue.  And it is normal for babies to wake up at night, there is nothing wrong with them.  People lie about their babies sleep haibts to conform to society's expectations and not feel like failures.<br>  <br>  Good job mamma!  Keep up the good work :)|`|5Np8w5MCaa	Don't worry about the things you have read.  Every baby is different.  My first daughter has always been a great sleeper.  She would go to bed a 8 and sleep until 8 by 4 months.  My youngest is 5 months old and she doesn't sleep very well.  She still wakes up at least once a night, sometimes twice.  He will sleep through the night when he is ready. My niece is 2.5 years old and she still wakes up at night.|`|GKGvRuHzaa	Each baby had a different way to sleep, some baby have long time sleeping some baby always wake up but it is normal as long as one day accumulation around 10 to 12 hours, and the important think you have to monitor his/her weight, etc.... routine checked to the doctor.|`|AAlB49iraa	just forget about what is normal. they have a mind of their own. our daughter did not sleep thru the night untill she was almost 8 months. and then it wasn't every night. it was sporatic at best. 6 hours is pretty average for that age. Sometimes when they start on solids it helps. Has she started the cereal at bedtime? ask your pediatrician and see if that is an option. I saw a huge difference in my son when he started on the cereal. i guess his little tummy stayed full longer and he slept longer. hope this helps!!|`|FbWpO6Wxaa	God - I'd have been thrilled if my baby was sleeping six hours at four months...you can't really expect a baby to sleep through the night until they're six months old. Some do it beforehand, but it's not very common. Hang in there - he'll get there eventually!!!|`|035f0c618509868724b99b045ce88d86aa	my 9 month old still only sleeps 5-6 straight at night. i think some people may be stretching the truth a bit when they say their infant sleeps 10 hours straight.just remember that this phase wont last forever. my 2 year old sleeps 9-10 straight.|`|IlIjGTdiaa	Are you insane? It's a baby, babies don't sleep through the night. Stop obsessing about bedtime routine and sleep and just enjoy your baby.|`|JzVRcHTNaa	my son is almost 4 months and wakes every 3-4 hrs a night! so every baby is different. you should be glad ur baby sleeps 6 hrs Straight..|`|hKc6pKJmaa	I've read from several sources that 5-6 hours at night is considered "sleeping through the night".  My little guys is 6mth and doesn't sleep through (although he used to and I think he's up now because of his teeth).  <br>  Anyway, all babies are different and I wouldn't worry about how other babies are sleeping.  Trust your bedtime instincts and when he's ready, he'll start sleeping longer at night. See those 6hrs as a blessing since it sounds like they don't happen all the time.  This time will be over soon!|`|SqD5tSB2aa	Do you mean 5-6 hours total?  Or does he wake up to eat and then fall back asleep?  My son didn't sleep through the night until 8.5 months.
WLYuDrlMaa	no. The pill makes your hormone levels change so that it prevents you from conceiving. You can never be immune to them|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Birth control is awesome, being pregnant when you don't wish to be sucks a$$.<br>  <br>  You can not become immune to the hormone of birth control, it has no proteins in it - they're small molecules without protein tags - our body has no way to develop an immunity to small molecules.|`|f2ef10d3d131060a658a610b8e839133aa	I don't think so.<br>  <br>  More information please - what pills? How long have you taken them for? Age? Weight? Smoker?|`|fl2quGcCaa	i dont know if the body can be "immune" but, yes, birth control sometimes FAILS, thats why I still wear a condom and my gf uses birth control for peace of mind|`|VB7RL0Jsaa	No.|`|QR6IHIZxaa	sadly yes.|`|7ki9mfh6aa	if you keep giving your body the medication-its going to keep working effectivly.<br>  <br>  if you stop-clearly your body wont receive the medication.<br>  <br>  if you start again-YOUR BODY IS GETTING MEDICATION
CxJFfSeiaa	about a week... maybe 2...  Depends on the woman. Try with First morning urine|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I'm pretty sure that the First Response pregnancy test can detect pregnancy five days BEFORE your missed period.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
8B3mlWfCaa	i would recomend to wait until the day before if not the day of your due period, if you test too early it may give you a false negative which can be rather upsetting. Good luck!!|`|tSh1zh7gaa	I am in the same boat, we just have to wait.|`|GZYN1rCTaa	too early still.  wait until around the 15th
SM4xIodaaa	No.... You would not feel that for a week or so.. it takes the sperm awhile to travel and implant.... not just an hour.|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	i dont think so... i mean MAYBE!! but maybe not..<br>  my implantation cramps started the day after we had sex and i assume concieved lol...and they went on for a week just like normal cramps sorta.....|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	if you had sex during ovulation or before than there is a chance u could be pregnant. implantation happens 5-10 days I believe after ovulation.
nZPGdcKJaa	go to a planned parenthood and get on any birth control<br>  that along with the condom will be fantastic protection.<br>  ask about the different pills, the patch, the ring, the shot, IUD and to explain ALL options|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	Sgt Shamy gave you an excellent answer. Thank you for being responsible.|`|fRs4nUdVaa	Be safe. You cant really say which days would be the safest. The pill will work but you have to make take it religiously. I'm on the ring and getting implanion (spelling) You can get it at planned parenthood for free. But I love the ring you put it in for 21 days then take it out for a week on your period. And Most def use a trojan condom!!! Durex DOES NOT work
ZZzQLjaKaa	The problem with not taking them is that even though the risk for your infant is small, the risk is grave. I read alot about it on the CDC website, and I would recommend it to you.|`|a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	If you were prescribed an antibiotic from a Dr that knows your pregnant, than I'm sure they are mild and not going to be harmful for your baby.  Not all antibiotics are made the same.<br>  <br>  Your Dr knows what medicines are better than others for you and your baby.  And I assume not taking them can be more harmful to you in the long run.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Um not sure what the difference is.  <br>  <br>  If they are the same sized cribs it should fit.  I would measure your crib and check the dimensions.
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Is his stomach hard or enlarged? <br>  <br>  Are you the only one that changes him?  Maybe someone else changed the poopy diaper.<br>  <br>  I would go to your Pediatrician ASAP.  It may be something as simple as a little prune juice.  Or your son my have some serious issues.|`|436fREgIaa	i already answered your other post..but no,it is not normal.cut out all dairy for 2 weeks or whatever you changed in your diet 2 weeks ago,and see if it gets better.call pediatrician and set up an appointment asap! and if baby has not pooped at ALL..get that baby to a hospital!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	You have a right to be worried - constipation is discenible by amount of excrement produced as well as frequency.  <br>  Have you tried giving him a mini-enema (i.e a few squirts of soapy water up his butt using the nose-sucker)?  If that doesn't work, take him to the ER again!|`|yR5BhCAzaa	Do you pump at all?<br>  <br>  If you do, you can put some Karo syrup in a bottle. Just a couple drops. Make sure she finishes whatever milk you have in the bottle with that. You can't re-refrigerate it.  You can give that little bit up to 3 times a day. Usually you'll get a pretty appreciated BIG poop soon - within the day.|`|QONP634Kaa	take him to the doctor immediately. that sounds bad.  you can die from that.
IlIjGTdiaa	It's scary but if he's breastfed then it's impossible to be constipated so you only need to worry if he's unhappy, or not being his usual self. My friends baby poos every 10 days like clockwork.<br>  <br>  Try bicycle movement with his legs, this can help and give him lots of warm baths.<br>  <br>  If you're still worried then you can take him to a doctor but if he's happy then there shouldn't be anything to worry about.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	What do you mean by "decent" bowel movement?  If he's been pooping at all, it hasn't been 9 days.|`|436fREgIaa	GET HIM TO A PEDIATRICIAN!! 9 DAYS IS NOT NORMAL.<br>  he sounds like he has a blockage.it can be dangerous!<br>  at that age,there isnt much you can do to rush poop.babies stomachs cant handle much other than formula or breastmilk.in my opinion,get that baby to a hospital if he hasnt pooped in 9 days.|`|AA12116854	CALL YOUR PEDIATRICIAN NOW. Don't wait because he can get poisoning in his system and that can be deadly for adults so I presume it is the same danger for newborns.|`|4x7GCzGCaa	Call your doc, not normal

Is it excessively watery?  It's most likely a blocked tear duct and it's very common.  <br>  <br>  Use a warm, damp towel to gently massage around her eye near the nose.  Do this several times a day - this will help the eye to drain and might help the duct pop open.  You can also take a q-tip and wet it with sterile saline and gently clean around the edge of her eyelid.  <br>  <br>  If it doesn't improve in a couple days or seems to be getting a lot of pus/is bright red, take her to the pediatrician because it might be an eye infection.  While nothing to freak out about, she might need some antibiotic eye drops.
ITCknAHVaa	I think you need to tell mum, and sit down and discuss options.  Visit a teenage health center and talk to the workers.  You need to sit down and talk to some one about various options.  <br>  <br>  You can have an abortion (I know its not what you want but you are very young) or could have the baby and give it up for adoption or have the baby and keep it.  No choice is easy, but you will need mum's support no matter what.<br>  <br>  Its not an easy choice and unfortunately no one else can make it for you.  Do not let anyone else tell you what is best for you (unless its a doctor or specialist) and no one has the right to condemn you or make judgements.<br>  <br>  You also need to see if its medically safe to have a baby at such a young age, because sometimes it is not.<br>  <br>  Good luck in what you decide.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey darling.<br>  <br>  Tell your mom.

I know you're upset but did you stop and think who will be doing most of the work and paying for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  You could save yourself and you mother a whole lot of pain with and abortion.

Just make sure there is time, but don't put it off because getting checked out is important in the beginning. Mom's are very understanding for the most part and she'll be there for you I'm sure.<br>  <br>  If you're not ready to have a kid, and you strongly disagree with abortion, there is always the adoption outlet. There are lots of people out there wanting children that can't have them due to medical problems. (Ever watch Juno, of course its hollywooded up but the general gist is the same).<br>  <br>  Also, it might be hard for you because you're young. You may have to sit out of school, home school, or repeat a year. Try your best not to stress and find some support groups, (in real life or on the net).<br>  <br>  Just remember not to put off telling your mom. I'm sure she loves you and putting it off might hurt her more.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you darling.

Kind of sickening if you think about it...|`|EwmHsEoiaa	He will be in the minority if he gets it done in Australia.<br>  See here:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Australia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Australia....</a><br>  <br>  The rates of circ have been falling in Australia since the 1970's.  Today the rate is about 10%.  The reason it fell is because it should never have been done in the first place.  Doctors realised that in the 1970's and the rates fell.  The downsides outweigh any small advantages.  Although circumcision advocates say there are advantages, there aren't.  Only 25% of the world are circumcised - 2/3  of these are Muslim.  In Britain, France, Germany, Italy etc, all the men do fine.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  Care for an intact boy is easier.  Just a few things you should know:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seal to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision ) <br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it.  It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced.  The foreskin becomes retractable by itself.  this occurs any time up until the end of puberty, though the average age is 5-10 years.  Until then, nothing to do.  A lot of doctors are not familiar with this - don't let them retract it.<br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.  It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier.  Most men worldwide (75-80%) are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a><br>  <br>  Circumcision carries a lot of risks:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/cac_complications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision....</a><br>  There is also evidence that the pain and discomfort of circumcision disrupts the mother-son bond and also breast feeding.

It's not done in public hospitals and most doctors discourage the practice because the risks outweigh all the dubious claims of benefit. I'm circumcised and hate it and there is every chance your son will resent it deeply if you find a rip-off doctor whose prepared to do it for a fat fee.<br>  The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later, at an average age of 10. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly.<br>  Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys’ foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.<br>  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. These complications and other more serious ones are often not found till puberty and do not show up in complication statistics. <br>  More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.  <br>  Your partner just wants his son to look like him. This is selfish and shows more concern for his own ego than his son's welfare. Your son is much more likely to want to look like his peers than like his father. Most men under 30 here in Australia are uncut. Save your son from this risky, unnecessary surgery and let him experience more sexual pleasure when he grows up.<br>  Geoff|`|TsjqzanQaa	Obviously you wouldn't have a female circumcision done to yourself, so why would you even consider perpetrating this on an infant?<br>  <br>  It's just the same; genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex of the victim.<br>  <br>  And no, it's not "okay" to do it in Australia or anywhere else.        It's your son's penis, not yours or his father's.<br>  <br>  Let him decide when he's older if he wants to have his penis mutilated by circumcision.<br>  <br>  In Australia, most males are uncircumcised these days.<br>  <br>  It's normal and natural to have a foreskin; there's nothing normal or natural about circumcision.<br>  <br>  I was damaged by it, and it caused more than the usual amount of loss of sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Look at some of the videos on the internet of circumcision, and see just what it is that they do to infants!       I don't have any links to them; I cannot bear to watch them.<br>  <br>  Leave you child as nature made him.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I was all for it until I thought about it.<br>  <br>  The fall in circumcision has fell tremendously! There are no medical reasons to have it done. It's not cleaner, if you wash properly. Being all natural makes sex feel better for him. And above all, IT'S NOT MINE. It's his penis and if he wants to do it later, then he can. <br>  <br>  You should watch one being done on YouTube. It's not something you can sit through if you have a weak stomach, or any kind of a heart.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  As for getting made fun of in school. With the decline of the procedure, by the time your son is in school almost all of the boys his age will still have a foreskin. <br>  <br>  As for it being cleaner...we females have a lot more skin and are always moist and a breeding ground for bacteria. Do we get our labia cut off to be cleaner?|`|pzLDXL6gaa	OK I live in Australia and it's really rare, around 10% of boys circumcised or less. It's not recommended, very hard to find a doctor who will do it and banned in most state hospitals. The reason? It's cruel and unnecessary.<br>  <br>  I'm university age, and most guys my age aren't circumcised, no problems and most people seem to be against circumcision, it used to be common a generation ago but things have changed. Are you sure you want to put your son through the pain, risks, loss in sexual sensation and then make him part of a minority so he'll realise what he's missing? It's not your husband's penis, it's your son's penis, and he should have the choice.<br>  <br>  They normally want people to wait until a year old in Australia, so they can give them proper anaesthetic.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|4arnbpUCaa	Circumcision for non-medical reasons is banned in public hospitals in every Australian state except Queensland. Less than 20% of boys are circumcised nowadays in Australia.<br>  The reason for the ban and low rate is that circumcision is now considered unnecessary. If a boy is educated about hygiene then he is very unlikely to ever have a problem with his foreskin.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I hate circumcision i am not going to lie. I just could never do that to my son (if i had one)<br>  Where i live it is not the norm to be circumcised, in fact a lot of people get bullied for it.<br>  To me the skin is meant to be there, so it shouldn't be removed, its a big money making scam i think!<br>  It is supposed to be cleaner but i have yet to meet a man who cant keep their uncircumcised penis clean! Also it cuts a lot of sexual pleasure for them also. (obviously you wont be thinking of that just yet!)<br>  <br>  There are even support groups out there for moms who went through with it at newborn. A lot of people i spoke to found it traumatizing.<br>  <br>  But, whatever your decision make sure you do your research so you do what you thinks best for your little boy.<br>  All the best on your decision! x Congrats|`|K4zsztkRaa	You aren't going to find hardly any doctors that will be willing to do it in Australia. It's very VERY rare there. Circumcision is NOT neccesary, there is no reason to do it so most 99% of doctors will refuse to do it there. I heard from someone there that there are only a handfull of doctors in the entire country that do it.<br>  <br>  Which honestly is a good thing because I mean it's your son's body, he should get to decide what gets done to it. Circumcision greatly reduces sensitivity, and makes sex less enjoyable for the male. I know that's a fact because I have restored my foreskin. I have felt the difference and it's a pretty big difference.<br>  <br>  as a guy who was circumcised at birth I can tell you I hate it and I'll never forgive my parents for doing it. (altho there are more personal reasons behind that) It's my body and no one has the right to alter it in that way but me. As a guy I see it as a major human rights violation, as do most doctors in Australia do which is another reason why they don't do it.<br>  <br>  Getting it done just because your partner wants to get it done isn't a good reason. I could care less what my parents want, it's my body and the only thing that matters is what I want.<br>  <br>  It's selfish to say I want a circumcised son. Because then your partner is only caring about their feelings, they don't care what their kid wants only them.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to be rude or anything but I think you should do a lot of research on the subject online. You will find out that doing this is pretty much barbaric and it's VERY traumatizing to the baby and causes psychological harm. The foreskin is a very important part of the male anatomy and serves multiple perposes and makes sex more enjoyable for the male and his partner. You'll see that taking it away without a direct medical need is a major human rights violation.<br>  <br>  I would urge you to look into it more.<br>  If your son wants it done he can go get it done later. But a vast majority of males who get the choice of what they want to do, they chose to stay uncircumcised. Not very many males chose that because when they have a foreskin they love it and don't want to ever get rid of it.<br>  <br>  -Connor

hNyedM9caa	A cough is not a sign of pregnancy, but some of the others could be. I would suggest waiting until your expected period and if you happen to miss it, take a test and see what happens. I know it can be stressful to wait that long, BELIEVE me, but remember that stress can delay your period, so try not to think about it *too* much until then (I know it sounds impossible, but try). The best you can do right now is simply wait it out. Frustrating, I know. <br>  Good luck, hun! :)|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Coughing is not a pregnancy symptom, and eating more than usual is not an early pregnancy symptom. These are all more likely just in your head. You don't need to worry unless your period is late, and if that happens, just take a test...|`|d3jtRA8caa	My best advice would be to calm down, if you become to paranoid you might convince yourself that you are. Then, your body will force symptoms. Calm down, relax. Wait to see about your next period.
a8IRxC4raa	Uh, huh.  And you want to teach English abroad, but you're incontinent.<br>  <br>  Troll.|`|DS21ekeJaa	If this is a sudden problem, then he needs to see a doctor. They will simply have him go to the bathroom and pee in a cup to test the urine for infection. Nothing embarrassing! <br>  If this has been going on his whole life, then he needs to be in charge of the problem. They make protective underwear that is not noticeable but his parents or a trusted adult will have to get them for him. His mom will eventually notice unless he is doing his own laundry? <br>  Limiting fluids could be dangerous, so only limit his fluid intake for 2 hours before sleeping. He can set an alarm to wake him every 4 hours to get up and go to the bathroom but it will make him sleepy the next day. <br>  Is he sure it is urine? If he is beginning puberty there are other things this could be if the amount of liquid is only enough to dampen his undies. This is normal and he will just have to get used to it!|`|i6mydMOyaa	Wetting the bed can be a sign or stress, or a physical problem with his plumbing (like an infection). <br>  <br>  If it's stress, he needs to find a way to relieve it...and stressing about not telling his parents will only make it worse. <br>  <br>  If it's plumbing, he might need medications or treatments from a doctor. <br>  <br>  He could go to the doctor himself if he is really worried about his parents knowing...but I could never see a normal parent getting mad or upset over this. He might be a little embarrassed, but his parents will probably just try to help him find a way to make it stop.|`|AA10967880	for starters bed wetting at such an age normally reflects sexual abuse. make sure the reason he doesnt want to tell his parents is that hes not being abuses.<br>  <br>  <br>  then the best way to stop it is to not drink any fluids before goin to sleep eg about 2 hours before hand and to make sure he goes before he goes to sleep.<br>  <br>  he could also hae a physical problem in his brain if the 2 solutions above dont work then he may need to get a check up from the doctors and possible brain scan as something may not be functioning as it should.|`|E9JigTskaa	he needs to be seen by a doctor<br>  <br>  you could go with him to the school councilor and get advice from them<br>  <br>  or maybe you or your friend have some other adult who you could trust to help you.|`|7imMv3Niaa	if not drinking for hours before going to bed doesnt work then make a doctors apointment - you should be able to do this without your parents knowledge.|`|6b2372efec0bab2093f79587ff546ffdaa	One of the best things to do is ALWAYS go to the bathroom right before going to sleep. Another thing, say you go to bed at 10pm. My suggestion is to not drink anything after 8:30 or 9. I had a problem when I was younger, but grew out of it. So, tell your friend not to worry, but he should tell his parents. For the simple fact of, if something is wrong, then they can take him to the doctor and see in there is something they can do to fix it.
WPI0Z47saa	Even if you hit ovulation perfectly you still only have a 25% chance each month of becoming pregnant. Don't just have sex when you think that you are ovulating. Instead have sex every 2-3 days to guarantee that you do not miss it because you don't always ovulate when you think. It is not always true that most women do 10-14 days after their period. This has not been true for me or anyone else that I know that has taken an ovulation test with a kit or by seeing their doctors. Also sometimes by the time you suspect ovulation is occuring it is often too late. You should have sex before ovulation for your best chances since sperm can live in your body for up to 7 days around this time. The best chance you have to get pregnant is to have sex 2 days before ovulation. So if you just do every 2-3 days for the month then at least you know that you did everything that you could and it is up to nature to take over at that point. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh and being on the pill actually increases womens chances of becoming pregnant when they stop it since it regulates your periods for awhile. I know that you said that you never had been on one but I didn't want you to be misinformed that this stops women or makes it harder for them.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	What  does your OB-GYN say?

BABY DUST!!!!!!|`|CwAffLaVaa	The way I got pregnant quick was to have sex at least twice a day, have your husband bust inside each time even during your period. It's also good to try different positions so the sperm can travel successfully. I got pregnant in about two months. =) Doesn't hurt to try and have fun at the same time.|`|AA11307951	Hey, who took my answer off?  Can't handle the truth, huh?  Again, get married first, get stable, then enjoy each other before having a kid.  It will not keep him around, or make him love you more.<br>  Example:  He already has a kid, she's now the ex, and you're only 20!
i3t1BhNmaa	I think around 16 w ur babt should measure about 6 inches which is about 16 cm. so this 180 mm means that ur baby is of 18 cm of length. (from top to bottom)<br>  and it's perfectly normal !|`|nhhCow4haa	i would say so. so its 18cms. Im only 5 weeks and i been told its 3mm big! haha
ksWm9eCBaa	I, too, had 'periods' for 1st 4 mos of my 1st pregnancy; it's not all that uncommon to have spotting early on....and what looks like "old blood" is actually less to worry about than bright red, thinner discharge.  You state the sex was in November OR December...but don't say anything a/b a period in December (if you think it might've been Nov), or Jan, just Feb...and this is March.  You don't mention any testing or doc visits....why?  If you don't want to or can't go to doc, please go to a clinic.  You need to be tested:  for your sake, for a baby's sake, if there is one.  Your health matters and you need to get a handle on all this...from several angles... stat!  Get going. (please!!)  :-)|`|veeC7Rvvaa	You could be pregnant, as you said some women do still get their period when they're pregnant. Your best bet is to get  a pregnancy test. You don't have to be a certain age to buy it and even if you can't afford it many GUM clinics and Pharmacies/GP's offer a free test. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and if you are pregnant then congratulations..<br>  however if you're not, then please be careful next time and make sure he puts a condom on CORRECTLY.. read the instructions, they aren't there for nothing.. they're important.<br>  Also, Check for STD's, because some types of sexual diseases cause cancer and infertility.|`|axaD1D0Caa	Try seeing the doc
0OzkwGWVaa	my hamster slept for ages hardly ever saw him because he was asleep during the day. But in the night he ran his wheel like a mad man on something and I know this might becomes a concern but I think its normal so don't worry about it. You should however be alarmed if he/she doesn't eat or drink anything. That's a sure sign something is wrong|`|POs5TeUDaa	and y would this be in this section..?<br>  <br>  so yah.. my hamster did the same a while back. i finally decided to clean her cage, the last time was about 3 weeks ago :/ (yes i am lazy). once i put her back in the new clean cage she got all crazy and wouldnt stop running around her cage for hours. after that, she was back to her happy self again (:|`|vxoWXVLKaa	Hamsters are nocturnal.  If you are leaving lights on until 1 or 2 in the morning, then he/she is not going to wake up until then.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	who cares, it's just a stupid hamster.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Okay.......................................|`|MeYILJeSaa	Lol at poop in baskets.<br>  <br>  Is he nursing?
1G3XPiq3aa	I don't think they're manipulating you. They probably don't even think about the fact you might need that time for other things. They just want time with you, and nothing else is going though their heads. It doesn't really sound like you're slacking off either. Just like you're enjoying the time you do spend with them more. =) Mums who are home all day are just as likely to be snappish and tired.|`|sxecXFgraa	My kids don't get away with things because I work, but they do get undivided attention from me when we get home.  I don't think they are trying manipulate you.  Manipulating you would be if they are trying to get you to give them something they don't deserve by making you feel guilty about working.  All kids deserve attention from mom and dad.  Next time, tell your husband to cook dinner.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	I don't think you are an manipulating mom. Good for you. You're kids need you and regardless how tired you are, you put your feelings aside and spend that "quality" time they so seek for you. I don't see nothing wrong with that. As moms, we need to bend the rules a little just so we can get the hug that will make our day. Good luck!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I don't think that is letting them "get away" with anything.  They missed mommy, naturally, so mommy SHOULD take that extra time out with her baby.  As a working mom, I use my time at home concentrating on my kids until they go to bed.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I was just saying the other day that I think my son thinks his name is "no" lol.  I do tend to slack off a little, but that is only because I miss him, too and I don't want what little time we have during the weekdays to be negative.  At the same time, I am feeling the repercussions of this now that he is 12 months old and trying to get away with everything.  I am starting to put my foot down more because I realized that even though I think our time is valuable, it is way more valuable to me to have a child that minds.

aWkp6AJOaa	we are having our semi-annual sale this weekend & if you put the effort into it it is definitely worth the time.  the last sale i did, i made over $120!!!  you just have to make sure that your stuff isn't stained & iron them.  they look so much nicer & sell lots better.  if you have any questions you can check out <a href="http://www.dittosforkiddos.net/aboutus.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.dittosforkiddos.net/aboutus.h...</a>  i am not for sure where you live but this is a great web site with all the info you need or any questions you may have.<br>  i am on my second consignment with them & have already made over $50 in one night and there are 2 more days left.  you may even have some consignment stores in your area that you would be able to do.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Yes i have! My Aunt owns a consignment store and i would send her all my kids old stuff, and even things i didn't wear anymore (mostly maternity and breast feeding clothing) and she would send me a check every month! (i sent her something ALL the time)<br>  <br>  it wasn't too much money, maybe 50 bucks a month, but it was something.
GJgZVKvXaa	You don't say how old your baby is.  For a newborn I would stick with one brand of formula just so you can get to know exactly what your baby's digestion and diapers are like.<br>  <br>  Once baby is a little older, 3+ months, and if he doesn't have a sensitive stomach, he could probably handle different brands.<br>  <br>  Formula keeps in sealed containers for a pretty long time.  What you could do is stick to one brand for bottlefeeding, and save the other brand samples you get for mixing his cereal once you begin to introduce solids around 4/5/6 months.|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	We did it without incident.  I'm not talking about switching them from Gentlease to Soy and back again, but we switched brands of the same type of formula and it didn't cause our daughter any sort of problems...  We regularly used the Parent's Choice (Walmart brand!) Sensitive formula, but occasionally Similac would send us free cans of Similac Sensitive (or sometimes, Walmart would be out of our way, and we would have to go to the grocery store, and Similac was our only choice!).  Anyway, it was totally fine for us.|`|DO0DWnBPaa	My daughter started drinking similac advance from day one but like last month she started throwing it up so we started her on Enfamil Prosobee and she seemed just fine with the change so we started her on the Similac Soy stuff but she throw that up too so we started buying WestSoy unsweeted organic soy milk. She is now 11 months old and her digestive system handled all that change just fine.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	I wouldn't. It is really hard on the baby's sensitive belly to be switching back and fourth. Plus, if the formula you are using is working fine with your baby then why would you want to risk him/her getting an upset stomach or even a possible allergic reaction. stick with what works.<br>  if you need assistance with formula you could apply for WIC then your baby would have enough and you wouldn't need to use any free samples because it would be plentiful. That isn't meant to be rude so please don't take it that way. <br>  <br>  Best of luck with your baby. =]|`|AA10826403	I wouldn't recommend jumping around, he use to what he is on now, changing it can lead to constipation or diarrhea.It wouldn't be very easy on his digestive system.|`|sAbah6dTaa	no!! that is very bad for a baby digestive system, if you switch, completely switch, never go back and forth.

dAQHWvY0aa	Not much more work at all - I WANNA SEE MORE CALEBISOS!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT - Ohhh, I guess I should put more info... I had my two exactly a year less a week apart. I thought it would be hell... Anytime that you have a second child with another child in the preschool or under age bracket, I think the hardest part is the first 6 weeks. It takes about that long for everyone to get used to the shift in the home, and of course the breastfeeding if you choose to, and the running after the toddler. Once you have been through that six weeks, you are kind of forced to create a schedule, not a written in stone one, obviously but just a guide to help make your life easier. My mom was here everyday for the first week, my older sister came the second week, my hubby was on midnights the third week - I had my bestfriend on a drop in basis, some friends would check in on us, and my landlady brought over dinner - My best word of advice? If you don't own an apartment size freezer, GET ONE. Make a ton of dinners in advance and freeze them, so that you don't have to worry about having food on hand for you, toddler or hubby that you have to prep. But other than that first 6 weeks, it's not that much harder at ALL. (I'll come help you for 6 weeks!!! Puhlease, puhleeease make more Calebs!)|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I will have a newborn in about two weeks. Our first son will only be 13 months. I'm not sure yet but I've been trying to have a set schedule for our toddler because I know that the new baby will set his own schedule. I think it'll be a lot of hustling and bustling in the beginning but it's something that hubby and I will eventually get used to. It'll have its advantages in the long run (: Good luck.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	It depends on what your newborn is like for one thing. I had my first two 13 months apart. That was rough and when my daughter was born, my son was still waking up at night and was always a handful. My daughter came home from the hospital and slept 9 hours the first night, so I lucked out I guess! It was hard taking care of my son when I was pregnant, I didn't get the sleep I needed etc. But, its all  part of starting a family and women having been doing it forever. Yes, it will be work, but you'd be surprised at how fast time goes by. My oldest son is now 28, my daughter is 27 and I have a 9 year old son (surprise!) I also have a six year old grandson! You can do it honey. Good luck.|`|iwtetdBoaa	if you try when hes is 2  they will be almost 3 years apart   thats a great age gap ;)  if you get pregnant when he is 2 it should be pretty easy :)<br>  <br>  when my daughter was 21 months old we tryed   and they or 2 yr & 6 months apart  it was a great age gap  then when my son was 3 months we tryed agian  now they or 12 months & 2 week  gap<br>  its been ok watching all 3    when i was pregnant it was a little hard watching my baby and being pregnant  but now its pretty easy<br>  <br>  mom to  3 & half yr old  girl ;)<br>  13 month old son ;)<br>  2 week & 5 day little girl :)|`|qLkknQx1aa	my kids are two years apart. - the only issue we have is that our oldest gets a little jealous sometimes.  naturally the baby just cannot "do" for herself so more time is spent on her. my son, who is now 4 says he wants to be "little" again so he can be held and stuff. - it's a really guilty feeling. - but as far as "work" goes, it's not bad. - chasing my son around the house helped me get my body back after having my daughter!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	When I was pregnant my daughter started going through her "terrible two" phase. It was horrific, my husband would be at work all day leaving me with her and at times I couldn't cope. I even with through bouts of depression because I didn't know how to deal with her and be actively involved with my pregnancy. My son will be 3 weeks old this upcoming Sunday but honestly it hasn't been that hard (so far). There are times when one calls for my attention than the other and you have to kind of split yourself in half to make sure no one is getting left out. I say just be prepared for anything, because you could sail on by and have a wonderful pregnancy and your son can be the perfect angel and give you no worries. Or you could go through some moments like I went through and honestly doubt yourself (because there were times I did). Just have faith in yourself and realize you are no superhuman; only mom. Just relax and be you. Best of luck TTC.|`|rFtKFp03aa	I don't know about a newborn and toddler, but I have triplets and they are  more work than 1 baby, obviously... But not hard work... just takes 20 more minutes to get out the door... we can't just run anywhere.. it takes time to get them all dressed, and all in their carseats and  all loaded in the truck.. lol <br>  <br>  I have babysat my 3 year old nephew since I had the triplets.. and he is no problem... he is very good, patient, and understands, babies are babies, and he gets all my attention next.. We went to the park.. that wasn't to bad either.. ..I just leave him in car seat while i got the babies settled... since he runs around and they stay put.. <br>  <br>  Thats my advice on that.. I think you will be fine... It will be exciting and give your little guy someone to play with ...

56q4sy3Haa	Your temperature goes up at ovulation and, if you become pregnant, stays elevated for the duartion of your pregnancy. <br>  Mine is normally 36.4 degrees C but at ovulation it goes up to 37.1 degrees C and it stayed at exactly that for my whole pregnancy. It's actually how i knew before the BFP! :)<br>  best of luck to you!|`|H74F8jxuaa	The temperature spikes after ovulation and it will stay up for at least three consecutive days.  It usually dips slightly the day before ovulation and then jumps and stays up for the remainder of your cycle if you are pregnant, if you aren't pregnant then it will drop the day you start your period.|`|0bb6a553404e8cd4f19e1c8f3c0df4abaa	It rises the day after you have ovulated. And it has to stay raised for 3 days to confirm that you have ovulated. Good luck!|`|rKCpkBfmaa	As the girls already said - temp. rises right after ovulation (usually next morning). <br>  But it's worth to mention that 'rises' means that it has to be higher at least 0,2 degrees to take it as risen.|`|H6D6jlKGaa	Hello :)<br>  <br>  I ave not actually tried this one but iam gunna start as soon as soon as my body gets back to normal but iv heard that your temp goes up!<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust to you!<br>  x
O0QmQYiQaa	I just had a m/c on Feb 4th and a D&C on Feb 23rd. My doctor said we could try again after 1 cycle but every doctor is different. You might want to contact your dr to find out when you should start trying again.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	You should ask your doctor about that. that's the best you can do I wish i could help but i think this is a question maybe only a doctor who knows your health better than us can answer to see if you're ready to ttc again. best of luck though!!|`|e33QAXShaa	It's probably best to wait 2 cycles or more. We had an all natural m/c last Sept and refrained from having any sex the week+ we thought we were fertile in October/November but got pregnant again because my cycles we're thrown off. We're now 19wks and pregnancy is going great.|`|0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	I would say ask the doctor but since it was so early in pregnancy and you already had a period then you should try again if you are ready.<br>  Good luck|`|H74F8jxuaa	I miscarried at seven weeks and my dr. told me to wait three months.  It didn't stop me from trying though, but I haven't gotten pregnant since then.  I would say that you should wait three months because it takes time for hormones to get back to normal.|`|ByUS0k8waa	My Dr told me to wait for three months to make sure your hormones are back to where they should be and your body will have fully recovered. If you don't wait the risk of a miscarriage is higher.
Ki6jlwnbaa	You shouldn't have anyone in the house for at least 6 weeks after the baby is born anyway. Don't worry about it really. You're pregnant, don't stress. If she is concerned or wants to catch up/ meet her niece or nephew, she'll call when she's cooled off or after the baby is born. If not, her loss.|`|y02PZj22aa	It makes sense that you don't want the hassle of a sister you haven't had contact with for 3 years when you're just coming home with a new baby.  You don't even have to apologize for not wanting to have to deal with the social issues involved with re-connecting while you are learning to be a mother.  Nor do you have to apologize for not having her sleep over in your absence.<br>  <br>  However, I strongly recommend you let your mom come to help.  You will be more tired than you can imagine for the first few weeks, and unless you have previously had the full care of a newborn, you cannot imagine how stressful it is.  While 860 square feet is relatively small, there is bound to be a place you can put an inflatable mattress for your mom so that she can be on hand to help you out.  When my first was born, we were living in 250 square feet, and both my mom and my aunt came to help--and I would have been lost without them.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you can hire a nanny, a cleaning service, a laundry service, and a cook (or get takeout for 3 meals a day), you might not need anyone else while you are learning how to breast feed, bathe, dress, diagnose, comfort, change the diapers of, clean up after, and otherwise deal with a teeny-tiny person who cries a LOT and produces an unbelievable amount of laundry.|`|Brqd1YcDaa	i had to put my foot down and just tell my family bluntly that i am coming home and that there is no room for anyone to stay with me.|`|ny94EXcGaa	I completely understand when my mother had my 12 years younger than i brother she completely did not want anyone to be over at our house 24/7.  Why dont you tell your mother and sister that after you have the baby you want some time to just relax with your new child and get settled and used to life with your newest addition to the family.  tell them you would be happy to have them in a few weeks or maybe a couple months but you are not going to be able to handle all the commotion.  I would tell your sister that your apartment is too small to keep any more as it is and ask if she would mind staying in a hotel?  if your sister is not up for that option tell her that maybe you can visit her with the baby after a while.  Its your life and im sure you dont want people walking all over you.  you are definitely not wrong for wanting to be alone with your family.
y96eYj0Faa	Take her to the doctor now! Don't wait too much longer. It will get worse before it get's better. It's probably just a smidge of the flu, but you should still take her to the doctor just to be safe.|`|9LeQgbxPaa	you need to take her to the dr immediatly! Thi could be something serious! I remember when my brother was 12 and he had a headache for several days one morning he woke up and his eye was swollen. The doctor told her had she gone to a dr sooner they may have caught it sooner and caused less damage. He lost some of the bone between his eye and nose that protect his sinisus . he had a large mass behind there!..hes fine now. and almost 18...but take her asap!!|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Take her to the doctor now, having a temp like that is bad and shouldnt wait.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Its just the flu.<br>  <br>  I had that for a whole week.|`|A03NJA26aa	I had the same thing for two days and on the third day I went to the doctor. They told me that 100 is a mild fever but anything higher is a serious fever so I would take her as soon as possible. My appetite was bad when I was sick and I had a cough and everything. Everyone gets different forms of the flu. Hope she feels better soon.
x5SJDvIraa	during my first trimester i took the Tylenol cold. doc said it was okay, as long as i wasn't taking huge doses all the time. So i would do like a quarter of a regular dose every eight hours or so. Helped me out when i was sick and feeling ugh.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this for some relief. Boil 1 teaspoon of powdered cinnamon powder and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper powder in a glass of water add 1 teaspoon of honey(you can skip honey if you don't like it) to it and drink sip by sip for effective relief from sore throat ,cold and cough repeat this every 2 hours until you feel a little better. Check out <a href="http://useinfo6.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://useinfo6.blogspot.com/</a> for more remedies and information.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Drink plenty of fluids ( i know you have heard this a million times but seriously it works drink so that your are peeing at least every half hour) drink herbal tea with honey is good. for your sore throat gar gal salt water (taste horrible but my dad always made me do it growing up and i got over my cold quicker.) suck on some hard candy you can take cough drops as long as they do not have alcohol in them <br>  <br>  get plenty of rest your body is going to need it<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	All I took for a cold/flu during pregnancy was:<br>  <br>  Tylenol for headaches<br>  <br>  Saline nasal spray for plugged nose.<br>  <br>  Ricola's natural cough drops for sore throat.<br>  <br>  Ginger in a bath for detoxification and relaxation.<br>  <br>  These are all acceptable during pregnancy. I talked to my doc and a pharmacist about it. Get lots of sleep and drink plenty of fluids!|`|Ys3ViuqTaa	halls and tea.. sudafed and tylenol is the only thing u can take through out pregnancy...
5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	I love how you describe it. That's exactly how I felt. My daughter is three months old now and I'm more relaxed now. I still don't like leaving her with people - I try to avoid that whole situation!|`|2AhcNaBzaa	no I would never in a million years want my baby back in my stomach I'm way happier now that she's out but then again I had a pretty hard pregnancy and I have allot of family so I don't have to worry about leaving her with strangers

555f4ccf8a2a051ad5d0e52353492915aa	Yes that is definitly a good reason why people cut themselves. Im sorry to hear that you have before and I hope you never will again! Its honestly not worth it, there are many other ways to release emotional pain. <br>  <br>  I.E.- Working out! That definitly is a good way to help the physical pain kick it! Haha.|`|RDL3Bvksaa	that does seem pretty accurate.<br>  i've been depressed, <br>  i've never cut though,<br>  i never understood it.<br>  i had a few friends who would cut for attention,<br>  and it always pissed me off<br>  because they don't understand real suffering .<br>  they just wanted sympathy .<br>  so yeah, i guess it could also be that they have a need to control themselves, because everything else in their life is not in their hands .<br>  or something ?|`|BkdZq0QPaa	different reasons, i knew people who have done it for attention and some becuase they have actual issues<br>  the most common thing is though because when youre feelin tht sh*t you become numb, cutting is a real sensation<br>  theres a really good quote from girl, interrupted though where they say something like, when you hurt so much on the inside you have to hurt the outside too|`|rtQi0SSraa	I think it is different for each person. What you described may be correct for you. And I think alot of people would agree. I cut off and on for 12 years now. It can be a hard Habit to break. But once you do stop for a while it gets harder and harder to start again.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	I heard, when someone cuts them self it releases a feel good hormone.<br>  or something :/|`|96aMio5Uaa	I was severely depressed for about 2 years. The main reason I cut was because of the physical pain outweighing the emotional pain as you mentioned.<br>  I stopped cutting about a year ago but occasionally I draw blood because I have a blood fetish as well, which was likely another reason I used to cut.<br>  What you said sounds accurate.|`|7imMv3Niaa	pain is real so its good.<br>  its a release and its something you control.<br>  its a distraction from the lesser? pain of the mental scarring.<br>  ok no its not greater pain but fresher so more attention is drawn to it.<br>  your body is your temple - by proxy you are making your exterior the same as your interior(ref to scars not cutting)<br>  both pain and the accompanying adrenalin are addictive.|`|cj1aRIJgaa	I cut because I know I deserve the pain. I reflect on all the things that have been said and done to me.. and those people close to me hurt me so I know I deserve.. not lookin for pity at all but i do it cause then i can move on cause i know i got the hurting over with for that part of the day.|`|5DDTt0OEaa	im not going to lie i have cut way to may time to where i got sent away i still do when i get depressed but thats only when i dont take my pill that stops that! but i havent done that for like two months now & from be for i have a lot of mark that will never go away and im stupid for doing that so dont do that you dont wanna have marks all over you from that|`|X2cfjzYXaa	That is a reason, i would say that because sometimes depression makes you so numb, you cant feel, and you cut yourself to make some sort of feeling sensation, even if it is painful.|`|AA11634257	they cut to feel alive <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6m6QG1ibPY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6m6QG1ib...</a>|`|gTH209Rraa	thats VERY accurate.. i heard on this show the haunting and this girl was cutting herself to think the physical pain was  worse than the mental pain... so yup but you obviously put it in a better way|`|V6pyMJekaa	Yes, it seems fine. I'm not really feeling the last sentence though.|`|3lFDvyY9aa	If you had to see what happens in the spiritual world you understand why.
BUI9HnH1aa	i use both .. <br>  the cloth diapers i use are the modern ones <br>  www.peapods.com - there are a lot of different ones out there<br>  they no longer leak like the old cloth diapers , u dont need the plastic pants to go over the top any more and the ones i have draws the "wetness" away from the skin so baby doesnt stay wet .. <br>  the only bad thing i can think of is having to wash them , lol <br>  i use liners with mine aswell so they dont get alot of poo on them . <br>  <br>  and we all know the pros and cons of disposables .. <br>  i use disposables at night and if we go out places .. its easiers to throw a dirty diaper in the bin , then carry it around with u till u get home to wash it<br>  <br>  edit :<br>  my son has never had diaper rash either and i have never used the rash creams|`|5WP9rLTlaa	disposables- <br>  cons are environmentally unfriendly and expensive<br>  pros are convenience and not having to clean them when your in an area that permits disposal of human fecal matter in the general waste.<br>  <br>  Cloth-<br>  big con is cleaning them- it can be time consuming and very unpleasant but in an area where it is illegal to dispose of human fecal matter in general waste then the cleaning workload is no greater than that for disposables.<br>  Also they have a higher initial set up cost than disposables<br>  <br>  pros- never running out!<br>  cost a lot less long term even with the cost of cleaning it works out to under $1000 from birth to potty, disposables can cost upwards of $5000<br>  Far more environmentally friendly- think how much landfill is avoided with this system.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is some babies have a reaction to the chemicals used in the manufacture of disposables and get rashes from them no matter what brand you use.|`|blvfPcNnaa	disposable diapers:<br>  The Pros:-<br>  <br>  ? Ease of use; disposables seem like the easier choice. They are an all-in-one product, with less fuss than cloth.<br>  <br>  ? Throw-away; disposables can be thrown away once used, unlike cloth which will need to be washed.<br>  <br>  ? Easy to travel with; disposables are the easy choice to use when traveling.<br>  <br>  ? Leak less; disposables tend to leak less than cloth. They have a tight, snug fit and are very absorbent.<br>  <br>  The Cons:-<br>  <br>  ? More expensive; over the years you will probably spend around $1500 diapering your baby in disposables.<br>  <br>  ? Bad for the environment; it is estimated that around 5 million tons of untreated waste is deposited into landfills via disposables every year.<br>  <br>  ? Harder to potty-train; toddlers can’t feel wetness as much with disposables, so it’s harder for them to potty-train.<br>  <br>  ? More diaper-rash; according to one study, 78% of babies in disposable diapers get diaper-rash, compared to only 7% of cloth diapered babies.<br>  <br>  ? Babies health; the chemical used to make the super-absorbency of disposable diapers is Sodium polyacrylate, which has been linked to TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) and can cause allergic reactions. <br>  <br>  cloth diapers:<br>  The Pros:-<br>  <br>  ? It’s cheaper; cloth diapers can be expensive for the initial set-up ($250-$700), but in the long run they work out a lot cheaper than disposables, depending on what system you use.<br>  <br>  ? Less diaper-rash; cloth diapered babies tend to have less diaper-rash, because natural cotton fibers breathe more easily.<br>  <br>  ? Can be used for subsequent children; works out even cheaper because you can use for any more children you have.<br>  <br>  ? Cloth diapered children tend to potty-train earlier, because the cloth tends to hold moisture closer to baby’s skin.<br>  <br>  The Cons:-<br>  <br>  ? Usually fastened with diaper pins, but you can now find ones with Velcro or snap fasteners.<br>  <br>  ? Some daycare centers won’t want to use them.<br>  <br>  ? Not good for traveling with; can be messy and not appropriate for travel. Most cloth-diaper users will use disposables when traveling or just being out and about.<br>  <br>  ? Can leak more than disposables; if not used properly.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	with cloth the wetness stays next to the skin and the mess goes everywhere even with plastic pants over them that are hot and uncomfortable.  I would go with the disposable wetness stays away from baby's skin and if you change often enough there will be no mess diaper rash and the baby will be more comfortable look at it as if you were going to wear it yourself  that's the way you should look at things when you are deciding stuff like that for your baby|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I received a gift of diaper service for a month from my baby shower.  I was really excited to use cloth diapers.  I did not even use them for the whole month.  My son was a heavy sleeper and would not cry if he wet his diaper.  They are far less absorbent than disposables so it would give him a rash.  They are also quite messy.|`|AA11920812	I actually started out using cloth for both my babies. I found a few problems with them that I didn`t think about.<br>  <br>  ONE, the water usage is insane. Our water bill just skyrocketed. You need to rinse them. I`d flush as much solid as I could, but I still need to swoosh in the toilet bowl to it to a point where I could save it to wash. <br>  <br>  Saving to wash is really stinky. And, bacteria builds up quickly. I had to force myself not to prewash every single poopy diaper in the machine. <br>  <br>  Stains from sitting are kinda nasty. And, putting something stained with what you know is poop is hard as a mom. You want to be the best and do the best and poop stains on the butt are rough.<br>  <br>  You have to be careful about what you clean with. You can NOT use fabric softner at all. It will cause build up. This means the diaper will NOT hold urine or poop. You will start to have leaks and blowouts. Then, you will have a mess on your hands wherever baby was. <br>  <br>  The soaps you can use with the diaper (like Tide Free and Allen`s Naturally) are so gentle they don`t rid of the smells entirely. You can also ruin your dipes with bleach. They end up getting a funky smell. And, then you have to strip them down with Dawn or Dr. Bonners. It was so much work getting them clean...and SO MUCH WATER it drove me nuts. IN good concisous I had to give it up. My in laws are from India and I know how valuable water is. They only get one can a day and I spent so much water cleaning and riding of smells and making them properly absorbant.<br>  <br>  Rash is more common because the wetness is right up against baby. You can aleviate this a bit with wool covers. But, some babies are allergic (both mine were).<br>  <br>  Fibers, man made fibers can be sensative on a newborns skin. My oldest reacted badly to the cotton babies BumGenius. He broke out in a crazy rash right where the elastic in the diapers were at the legs and around the waist. It took me forever to get rid of that. I did use sposies while he had that rash.<br>  <br>  You`ll have to decide what`s best for you. I know my girlfriend had a diaper service the first six months for both her kids. That eliminated the need for all the washing. And, not having to fiddle with stains, smells and stripping.<br>  <br>  Here are the ones I liked the best:<br>  <a href="http://www.cottonbabies.com/index.php?cPath=98" rel="nofollow">http://www.cottonbabies.com/index.php?cP...</a><br>  <br>  The bamboos where my ultimate favorite. But, you need a cover. The All in Ones don`t require a cover and stay really dry. They have an inner liner that pulls out for washing. Its super absorbant! I have both of them actually.<br>  <br>  The bamboos were nice during summer. Both my babies were summer babies so I got away with not wearing covers.|`|vSBJxSL7aa	honestly cloth diapers seem kind of gross. you wash them but you are putting a dirty poopy diaper in the washer and you are constantly washing!!! and you are putting a cloth diaper that has been used many times that will gather bacteria no matter how many time you wash them. i think disposable diapers are better, only use them once, and throw them away, the only bad thing is spending the money every week or two but its a clean non-used diaper everytime. and easy to change. cloth diapers are harder to change|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	i just like disposable so much better. i know that cloth is better for the environment and cheaper, but seriously, i dont have patience for washing poop diapers, and dont have a washer nearby to do it. i like being able to just toss out used diapers, even if it costs a lot more. plus- cloth leaks more, which is another no-no for me.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	<a href="http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/cloth-diapers-versus-disposable-diapers-pros-and-cons/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/c...</a>

AA10953561	Oh my baby girl loves to ball up and make a certain part of my uterus rock hard. The difference between this and the braxton hicks I've felt is that when she balls up it only tightens some of my uterus, but when I'm having a braxton hicks I feel it all over my uterus.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|tvtEVjdkaa	Well, any time that your stomach tightens up it could be the braxton hicks contractions, or it could be the way the baby is positioned, every time the baby moves you will feel some kind of tightening, but you shouldn't be alarmed, but if ever you are worried, don't hesitate to call your doctor!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Is it off to one side? If so it could be your baby.|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	Not necessarily contractions, and even if it is can can be braxton-hicks, false contractions. My son was the world's worst for balling up and pushing as hard as he could on my stomach. But it also depends on the timing, and if it is very painful or not. If you are not sure go and let your obgyn give you a check up to be on the safe side. Good luck!
r7q8LW7Aaa	According to YA, you're a bad mother if you;<br>  formula feed, breastfeed, start solids before 6 months, withold solids when your baby needs it, co-sleep, put your baby in their own bed, put them in their own room too early, have too many kids, have single kids, are too young, are too old, are unmarried or single, are divorced or seperated, accept medical help during pregnancy, refuse medical help during pregnancy, allow dummies/pacifiers, don't allow dummies/pacifiers, use cloth nappies, use disposable nappies, use IVF treatment to concieve, adopt, put a child up for adoption, smack, don't smack, CIO, don't CIO, allow your child to eat sugar or salt, refuse your child treats, go to work, stay at home....<br>  Anyone got any others for the list?<br>  I'm still learning to ignore the idiots on here who judge me for the kind of mother I am.

I'm a firm believer in recycling everything you can. If the clothing is in good shape i would accept it. I try not to judge other people and I would hope people don't judge me.
48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	The clinginess could definitely be part of teething.  My son was also clingy when he started getting teeth.  As far as the sleeping goes, I think as long as she is sleeping at night, I wouldn't be concerned about her naps.  If she is tired enough that she needs to sleep 5 hours, then let her.  She can eat when she wakes up.  She is not going to starve while she is sleeping.  I agree with the person who said she may be going through a growth spurt.  I know my son was more tired when he went through them.|`|FLpMShKNaa	OK, I cannot do math, and figure out the hours she has slept, but kids her age need around 14 hours of sleep a day. She is sleeping less than 12 at night, so she will need a long nap. Might you try putting her to bed earlier? Around this age, we discovered my son needs to go to bed around 7:30. MAny kids tend to sleep the soundest with a bedtime between 6-8 p.m. if there aren;t other warning signs, it could be a growth spurt. If it concerns you,call the pediatrician.|`|XmO3nFSLaa	She probably has an ear infection or something...my son slept alot like that but wasnt too fussy or anything and he had a check up where they saw he had a HORRIBLE ear infection the dr couldnt believe how smiley my son was with such an ear infection...take her to the dr if this has lasted more than a few days....|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	I would call her pediatrician and just ask. If she is sleeping she is obviously tired for some reason or another. I personally would try to limit nap time to maybe 2 hours at a time and then if she gets tired again in another 3 or 4 hours and tries to go back to sleep let her rest for another hour or two. But just call her doc to make sure she isn't sick with anything. I would also check her temp if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  I would tell her sitter 'the doctor thinks her nap times are a little bit longer than they should be during the day time hours. i know it seems awful but if you could wake her up after 2 or 3 hours so if won't start to effect her sleeping patterns at night that would be a great help.'<br>  <br>  good luck with everything.|`|J2bnw5EZaa	I would try to limit the daytime sleep only if it is interfering with her nighttime sleep.  She might be getting a growth spurt and taking more sleep than normal.|`|VUNfI7yBaa	I think you should let her sleep. She might be going threw a groth spert|`|rFtKFp03aa	That is pretty excessive sleep.. it seems.. but lets add it up.. <br>  she had from 9pm - 630 ....9.5  hours of night sleep...  another 20 minutes in car there and 20 minutes on car back.. 40 minutes... we are now at 10hrs 10minutes for sure.....then she slept from 8-1 another 5 hours.... that brings us to 15 hours and 10 minutes...  total sleep.. <br>  <br>  I have 9 month old triplets.. they sleep 12 hours straight at night.. then take 2- 2 hour naps... totaling 16 hours of sleep total! Which my doctor recommended and so have all the books I read.. <br>  <br>  I would say you need to put your daughter on a schedule where she goes to bed earlier at night..My babies are asleep by 730 every night.. <br>  We put them in bed between 7-30 but never later than 730... <br>  <br>  I think your daughter should sleep 630 to 630 because thats when you have to get up to take her to the sitter.. so that gives her 12 hours.. .<br>  <br>  then take 2 2 hour naps during the day.. the sitter should wake her after 2 hours... <br>  <br>  I think she is just tired.... :)
tSEA42Uraa	There are a few I'm thinking of that may work:<br>  <br>  ~Margaret (With all the possible nicknames, Mickey could work.)<br>  ~Magdalene (With all the possible nicknames, Mickey could work.)<br>  ~Magdalena (With all the possible nicknames, Mickey could work.)<br>  ~Michiko (A Japanese names meaning "beauty, wisdom".)<br>  ~Mignon / Mignonette (French names -- "Min-yon". Mickey could work.)<br>  ~Mieko (A Japanese name meaning "Already prosperous".)<br>  ~Milica (A Slavic name meaning "Work".)<br>  ~Millicent (Mickey could definitely work here!)<br>  ~Mercea ("Peace" in Slavic)<br>  ~Miyoko (Japanese name meaning "Beautiful Child".)<br>  <br>  Sorry for all the Japanese names, I just stumbled across them and though how wonderfully Mickey could work for them!<br>  <br>  My favorite of these, that I think Mickey would absolutely work for, is Millicent. It's adorable!|`|zqxVU9xVaa	Michelle<br>  <br>  Micsha (Is a RUSSIAN BOYS NAME, is ALSO A GIRLS NAME.)<br>  <br>  Makenzie<br>  <br>  Macayle<br>  <br>  Marcella<br>  <br>  Marka<br>  <br>  Meika<br>  <br>  Mashaka<br>  <br>  Mackenna<br>  <br>  Makala<br>  <br>  Marciara<br>  <br>  Marcena<br>  <br>  Matrika<br>  <br>  Meka (Mekah)<br>  <br>  Meleka<br>  <br>  Mercedes<br>  <br>  Monique<br>  <br>  Monica<br>  <br>  Micke<br>  <br>  Amique<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Mika<br>  Dominique<br>  Micheline/Micheline<br>  Marcheline<br>  Maksima<br>  Maksimilienne<br>  Makena (Spelled this way it is an African girl's name meaning "Happy one")|`|FQrl1Azbaa	i was at school with a girl called melissa. <br>  <br>  we called her mickey. she was quite small and quiet too!|`|NnatPbU7aa	There is a model named McKey (pronounced similar to Mickey but slightly different). She could be McKey with the nickname Mickey. <br>  <br>  People have already suggested what I was going to say, but I thought of two unique feminine names for a girl, McKinnon or McKnight.|`|MsOFK7dCaa	What about Domenica? There's a girl at my school called that and people call her Mica. Mickey could easily be a nickname for that|`|8B3mlWfCaa	Michelle|`|hV48lhvqaa	Mikael|`|ksXayEUoaa	Michelle|`|mZrydsoKaa	Mia or Myah <br>  Miriam<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you do not have to have the character's name match with the nick name Mickey. I have a lot of nicknames that have nothing to do with my first name but have everything to do with my middle or my last or a phrase I always say. Maybe incorporate that into your writing as a reason for the nickname Mickey.
nrqWwQBXaa	my son was born a preemie he spent 2 months in nicu then when he was 1 he was hospitalized from rsv. my main support has always been my mom she has always been there by my side. if it was not for her i don't know what i would have done. oh yea in the nicu there was a really wonderful nurse that helped me she was the best. i felt alone some times i still do but i know my mom was right there feeling the same way i did she would always think what could have i done to help so my daughter did not have giving birth early well there was nothing she could have changed. so she was by my side feeling the same as i was?|`|oSMNx6L5aa	My son was almost 8 weeks premature. I can't imagine going through that with multiples god bless you. I was 14 when I gave birth, which meant not very much support from the family, thankfully my boyfriend was with me the whole time my son has been relatively healthy since his come home (he's now 8 months old) <br>  <br>  You're not alone, I know how you feel and I know how scary it is seeing their machines go off and feeling like you'll go into a state of panic and helplessness. My son means the whole world to me and when I got those feelings that he may be gone forever my heart would just drop and I knew I'd be lost without him.<br>  <br>  We had a 40 minute drive to the hospital for 6 weeks in a row until he was well enough to come home, and everytime we had to leave the hospital I just wanted to break down, I would've slept right next to his incubator if I could've. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck I know exactly how you feel and sometimes you need moral support and a little bit of comforting. I'm always here to talk feel free to e-mail me = )<br>  <br>  chelsea.miracle@yahoo.com|`|GvtM9H6yaa	First of all....  CONGRATULATIONS mom!!!  What a miracle each of those little babies are!  I am sending warm, healing thoughts to you and your babies!  <br>  When my daughter was born, 6 weeks early (3lb10oz), a friend had given me a book called 'Preemies: The Essential Guide for Parents of Premature Babies' by Dana Wechsler Linden, Mia Wechsler Doron, Emma Trenti Paroli  ~ It was really useful to me...  In the back of the book it gives many valuable resources for support.  <br>  Also, I searched online for groups... looking for anyone who could understand the emotional pain, the fear, the responsibility/self blame & the INTENSE & OVERWHELMING LOVE I was experiencing.  It seemed to me that no one in the 'full term' world understood the complexity of the situation.  However, there are many parents out there who have seen their child in a NIC-Unit and those parents do understand...  Keep at your search for support and you will find it!  Know that you are not alone in this!!!!  <br>  I hope the very best for you and for your newborns.  Please take care of yourself because when they come home with you, you will need your strength.|`|YNdExdoraa	Congratulations first and for most. I also have multiples. I have triplets that are nearly 6 months old. They too were born early.. My babies spent their first full month in the NICU.  It was very hard, it tore me apart to have to leave them every night. Everyone kept telling me that it would get easier, but the only thing that made it better was to bring them home. I know it's hard to endure. Megan was having problems keeping her heart rate steady and I was constantly holding my breath hoping she'd pull through. Jack had difficulty breathing and had to be vented a few times and Emma just had allot of problems adjusting to feedings and regulating her body temperature. I was always afraid when the phone rang. I really feel for you, I know what you're going through and I pray your babies get well enough to come home soon.<br>   My husband was there every step of the way and that was a major comfort. Our entire families chipped in to help us with our older kids so we could be with the babies as much as possible. They were all helpful. Someone suggested to me to join a multiple moms group for support. I did and found one right in my area. It was the best thing I did. These woman are amazing and helped me with everything. Ask the NICU if they know of a local multiple moms group you can contact. My group isn't just a support group but we are a group of friends who all have multiple children in common. We get together exchange advice, baby items and play dates for the kids. It really helped me, hope you look into it and meet some more amazing people like yourself. <br>  Good luck, I know it'll be a hard road for a long time. You'll find more difficult roads ahead of you. Just stay strong for you and your blessings. Remember to take time to just appreciate yourself and your little miracles<br>  <br>  email me if you want to talk....cld863@yahoo.com.|`|fniHoVyaaa	My son was born preemie as well, and even though I only had one at a time, I know how you feel. I have a 3 year old daughter too, and when I would go to the hospital to see my son in the NICU, I had to leave my daughter behind and I felt horrible, and the same when I spent time with my daughter, I felt horrible for leaving my son at the hospital. <br>  All I can say to help would be to get some rest. It will be allot easier to deal with when you are well rested. Not saying that it is a easy situation, but you will feel a little better with some sleep. Just love them all you can when you are there with them, and just remember everything happenedfor a reason even if it is hard to understand why.<br>  ((hugs))|`|pNKBszseaa	any time you need to chat please email me! Seabresmom@hotmail.com. My eldest was born with no complications but when she was 8 weeks old she caught RSV. It was horrible, i didn't know what to do for her, she struggled so hard to breath. She was hospitalized for almost 6 weeks for it. and that was just the beginning for her. After several more hospital stays for vomiting and FTT i found out i was prego again. When she was born she was born 6 weeks premie. and at 12 weeks she caught RSV and was in the hospital for 9 weeks and almost died from it. she still suffers from lung damage and she is 6. It is hard, i blamed my self every day. It will get better. You and those beautiful babies are in my prayers. Good luck
7rCeCVl2aa	Fortunately this happened at my sisters house and not mine. UNfortunately my child was involved.<br>  <br>  My at the time 5 year old was rough housing with my niece in the dining room and they knocked a can of spray paint off the kitchen table. It exploded! Do you know what happens when a full can of spray paint explodes? LOL!<br>  <br>  It was all over her new CUSTOM wallpaper, solid oak kitchen chairs and table, ceiling, custom curtains, brand new windows, sliding glass door, rug and the kids were both dark green too! <br>  <br>  She was so frazzled and upset with the situation she put them on the bus and sent them to school like that. I think I may have reacted the same if two children just did thousands of dollars worth of damage in my house... She called me at work and told me what happened so I met the bus at the school. They had paint in their hair, all over their clothes, all over their shoes and their arms were covered too.<br>  <br>  What a mess that was. She had to file an insurance claim. The total Damage was just shy of $6000.00 to replace it all. She had a $500.00 deductible.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I tried doing some DIY home renovation...well, I wanted to tile my master bathroom. So, I bought the tile and thought I was doing a great job. When I was done I stepped back and looked at my handywork and all around the toilet is completely messed up. There's big gaps and it looks horrible. I'm gonna have to get it fixed, but for right now it's staying that way.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Most of my mistakes came from babysitting or being a teen aunt.  :P  <br>  <br>  There was the kid who found scissors, and looked at the huge beanbag chair... if there's anything worse to clean up I've yet to find it.<br>  <br>  There was the time I spilled paint all over the carpet.  Calling a carpet cleaner to help me (I was home alone as a teenager, NOT the mess you want your parents coming home to...) the guy told me all I had to do was just get the wet-vac my parents had and keep adding water and sucking it up, it was water-washable.  I felt so stupid.  <br>  <br>  And then there was the time when I thought my daughter couldn't reach the box of KIX through the babygate.  Heh.  She got it, and poured it all over... what a mess!  <br>  <br>  Grossest moment still is when I came out and was playing with daughter and she found a dead mouse and put it in my hand.  She had no clue why I shrieked, or how she got dumped in a tub and scrubbed so fast while hubby disposed of the mouse.... ew.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It seems that most of my domestic accidents revolve around cooking. Like the time I made meatloaf and went to drain off the grease - it fell out of the pan and onto the countertop, my shoes and the floor. Gack. We did manage to salvage most of it, though. :)<br>  <br>  I'm a big time spiller. My range often looks like someone left a pan of spaghetti sauce on a high boil for like a week (well, not *that* bad but close). And of course there are those science experiments that often get out of control in the fridge - you know, the "use to be meatballs" and other things that grow in places where you can't see them. Or the can of something that somehow sprang a leak? Got dented? Not sure, but it was growing mold and oozing something nasty down the back of my cupboard. Since I can no longer bend over to look LOL I missed that one for a while and my husband had to clean it up. :)<br>  <br>  Before I have everyone thinking I'm feeding my family from an e-coli factory, LOL I really am (sort of) a clean person, at least when it comes to food. :D|`|FsmcCXlvaa	When visiting my mom I put my son down for a nap in her bed. The whole family was there and they had their purses stashed in the room as well. When I went to check on him a couple hours later I found him sitting in the middle of her bed with my sisters makeup bag. He had dumped out all the makeup and was putting it on himself and everywhere else. She spends a lot of money on her cosmetics and they were practically empty. Not to mention my mom's white duvet that was ruined. That was the last time anyone left bags out of their sight with my son around :)|`|cE0Xat61aa	omg i have so many! my daughter got into her diaper rash cream (desitin) and spread it all over our leather sofas, floor, and of course herself. I laugh now, but when i saw it, i was so overwhelmed! lol another time, she got into the vaseline and put it in her hair, it was greasy for days!!!! of course they both have put their art work all over my walls with crayons, as well as the sofa! all these things have happened in the three or four minutes it took me to use the bathroom, and i thought they were watching Dora! LOL|`|ntdGOZqGaa	We just moved into our house and didnt have a dryer yet, so I was busy that day and had to hang clothes out on the line, I was talking to my mom on the phone while doing the laundry and I knew it would only be a couple of mins so I left my two year old in the house. Nothing was in reach for him to hurt himself, but anyways he got into the pantry, i come inside and step in this stuff it was all sticky I looked at him and he got into the syrup the big huge bottle and poured it all over his head and the cat!! Him and the cat were sitting on my couch covered in syrup! All I could do is laugh it was laugh or cry lol what a mess|`|EeGgovyCaa	Noah's mom - That is hilarious!! LOL I can so picture my DS doing that<br>  <br>  <br>  One of the things I don't think about is when I get home from work, like always I'm always needing to use the bathroom bad. So I throw my purse on the table next to their baby gate. My son climbs up the couch and leans over to grab my purse. <br>  <br>  when I come back in the room all my stuff is scattered.|`|WNsjy5oFaa	my partner and i were quite young when we first got together and when he got his first office job i accidentally dyed all his brand new expensive white shirts blue due to a stray sock i'd missed. fortunately he never found out as i rushed out to get one of those dye remover things and luckily it worked, they came out sparkling white|`|8t8NjjnVaa	Ah, I've got two stories for you.  When my first child was a baby, I used to pump some milk to keep in the freezer in case I ever needed to be away.  I would put the breast pump parts on to boil for 15 minutes after I used them.  One day, I was especially tired and forgot about the boiling water/pump parts.  <br>  <br>  I remember thinking "What is that strange smell?".  After I finally realized what happened, I went into the kitchen and all the water had boiled off and my breastpump parts had melted to the pot.  All were ruined.  The parts only cost me $20 to replace, but the pot was $75.<br>  <br>  Second story...I gave my then almost 2 year old some yogurt in the living room to eat and I went into the laundry room to switch over the laundry and get a new load in.  I was only out of her sight for a couple of minutes, but when I got back, she had completely painted the couch with the yogurt.  Oh...THAT was fun cleaning that up :0<br>  <br>  Oh wait, one more.  My dad had come over to visit and my then 2-year-old went to use the bathroom.  A little while later, she came over to me and my dad and kept saying something about "Christmas Lights".  We didn't know what the heck she was talking about...it wasn't near Christmastime.<br>  <br>  She was all excited and just kept saying "Christmas Lights".  Finally, I just said "Show me." and she led me and my dad to the bathroom, which she had completely draped with not one, not two, but three rolls of toilet paper.  I wanted to be mad at her, but neither my father or I could stop laughing!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I got a tip for ya! If you ever get permanent marker on cloth again (carpet, couch) Use the dual action spray and wash at full strength. Took it right out of my couch when my daughter got into it.<br>  <br>  My story is around the time my daughter was waking up really early and not waking us up. She decided to go in the fridge to make herself some scrambled eggs. I woke up to her banging around only to find egg EVERYWHERE. Couch, tables, carpet. Nothing takes out ground in raw egg. So we had to replace the carpet with laminate (thank god, just needed that one reason haha) we had to replace the couches. Of course when I first woke up and noticed I was fuming mad, I could have killed her then. Now all you can do is laugh about it...still not laughing about the $1500 reno we HAD to do because of it.|`|wCRC0poAaa	when my son was about 3 years old i left the room for a few minutes - he was colouring in his colouring book. when i came back into the room i looked at him, he looked up at me and smiled, and i screamed. he had drawn ON HIS EYES with a bright blue marker. not his eye lids but his actual eyes. the white parts of his eyes were bright blue. i panicked, didnt know what to do so i brought him to the A&E where they gave him a tetanus injection just in case of blood poisoning and a special eye wash. phew!! he was fine and didnt know what the hell was going on with his crazy mom. when i showed him himself in the mirror he said "cool". we often laugh when talk about this, but at the time i was so afraid he had damaged his eyes. <br>  another time my partner left his razor on the bathroom sink and guess what, yep, little boy decides to shave his tongue. luckily i caught him at it before he really did do damage. phew again!!|`|zaF5gd48aa	I have a 2 year old and a 10 month old yesturday while I was doing dishes my 2 year tried changing my 10 month old (he was poopy). Long story short It was everywhere. Luckly we have wood floors.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Lol!! Sorry that made me laugh :P<br>  <br>  Okay this is about my mum & my cousin's daughter...<br>  My mum used to childmind my cousin's daughter from when she was 3mos - 4yo. One day they'd been to the shop when Leah was 2yo and was helping my mum put the shopping away when the phone rang. The time it took for my mum to leave the room, get the phone and come back, Leah had started putting various items in the bin.... lol. My mum didn't know whether to laugh or cry, especially since the items she'd put in weren't wrapped up haha.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol, I'm sorry, but I had to laugh. Only because I can see myself doing this too...<br>  <br>  Hmm... yesterday I was taking a shower while Noah was in the bedroom. I had the baby gate up at our bedroom door so I thought "No problem, I'll be in and out before he can get into anything." Ha! I heard him come into the bathroom so I peeked out and he was sitting on the floor. Not even a minute later I heard him unrolling the toilet paper off the roll. I quickly got the shampoo out of my eyes and found him happily munching on a big wad of it. Ick!

xPfJG3FGaa	well i'm 40 weeks today! and i didn't get 1 stretchmark yet, i started early, puttimg cremes on everyday, so far i've used palmers cocoa butter massage cream for stretch marks, bio-oil, and i made my own mixture that i used for a while, i broke open about 200 viatamin e gel capsules, squeezed the gel out of them and mixed it with pure cocoa butter that i had to melt down, and also put some regular lotion in it because it was really thick and sticky. Right now i am currently using curel lotion for pregnancy, i liked the bio-oil, but it was getting expensive so i had to try other things! all i can tell you is start now, and never let your stomach get dry or itchy, keep it moisturized at all times with whatever product you decide to go with, it worked for me, everybody is different, and i used so many different things, i can't tell you what did it for me. or maybe it was all of them combined i really don't know, i just made moisturizing my stomach a part of my daily routine just like brushing my teeth!|`|OMTSqrSFaa	you cannot prevent stretch marks .. if your going to get them you will get them .. i tried every thing .but you can only lessen the appearance.... all you can do is keep your skin really moisturised .. use bio oil and coco butter these are what recommend when pregnant to lessen appearance of them x|`|HkDUxkS4aa	congrats on the baby!<br>  <br>  It's really all on ur genes..does ur mom have them? does your grandmum? If they do then ur likely to end up looking like them... My mum and grand mum had horrible ones and thats why my husband is having a vasectomy, I just love my body too much for ugly marks to happen.<br>  <br>  Also with your stats I would recommend to talk to a doc about how you could lose some weight...Im 5'6 and weigh 118, just eat healthy and drink lots of water and use lotion, it will help!|`|IdwbQTIaaa	cocoa butter works wonders, they even sell special lotions and creams made especially for pregnant women to prevent stretch marks!  Congratulations!|`|NZQ9UleVaa	coco butter|`|mkph8r0taa	I was stretch mark free up until my 32nd week of pregnancy and suddenly they just came up on me overnight! I used that Palmer's Cocoa Butter pregnancy rub religiously and it failed. :( It all depends on your body and genetics. <br>  <br>  I'm pregnant again with #2 and about a month and a half ago I purchased a bottle of Bio-Oil from Walgreens and I'm starting to see small results on my stomach with my stretch marks from my last pregnancy. I've read a lot of good reviews about this product and so far I really like it a lot. The Bio-Oil is for prevention and treatment of acne scars, wrinkles, stretch marks, etc. and it runs about $12-24 at stores like Walgreens and K-mart. It definitely can't hurt to try! Good luck!|`|azE51WGRaa	Try using palmers cocoa butter cream for stretch marks. It works really good at preventing them, although they can still happen. You might not get a whole bunch but be prepared for at least a few. Stretch marks doesn't mean you didn't take care of your skin well enough. It means that you're going to have a big, beautiful, healthy child. Think of the ones that you do get as love marks from your baby =D good luck and congrats!|`|go2SGvFxaa	nothing will stop stretch marks but coconut butter really helps with preventing them<br>  ive been affraid of stretch marks because my mum got ALOT but since using the coconut butter i have only got 3 little ones on my stomach and 2 small stretch marks dots on my sides. thats it.|`|ksWm9eCBaa	I used copious amts of cocoa butter...the goopy kind from a jar...and the only stretch marks I have are the ones I attained well before pregnancy...in my thighs...after a 7th grade growth spurt!  None on tummy OR boobies!|`|3IimJWgXaa	Coconut oil.. put it in the fridge. the kind u bake with haha NO JOKE!!

There are many different sides to this story. We are all human and no one is perfect. America needs to have a more modern and open attitude towards adoption and also to realize that a child can be born with a mental illness that is really no ones fault as it just happens in life. There have been adoptions throughout history, so I do not understand why America goes into a seizure over the word, adoption? It's a mystery why people get upset over the concept of adoption.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	When you post something positive about adoption it gets slammed fast or being told I'm seeing rainbows and puppies. (Not directed at you Mei-ling. There are some others here than jump on anything and aren't open. I feel you are open to all views that why I'm sharing.) <br>  <br>  I can give you something i feel is benefit- There are children who do want to be part of family. They want to have their parents last name the same as the rest of the family and stability in life without fear of (in some cases.) Of their birth family taking them away from the family they know and trust. Foster care doesn't really offer that to kids. Permanent care does to a degree, but children often want the same surname as the rest of their family. As a long term foster kid what they really want. (Some will say their birth family and others will say to be adopted by their family.)<br>  <br>  And our kids adoption was chosen for them. Their Nmother didn't want foster care.

And in 99% of cases, there is absolutely no need for it.  If mothers' rights were protected, including the right to all adequate and sufficient social support such that there is no fear of dire poverty, plus healthcare, and daycare later on so that the mother can work when the child older, adoption wouldn't be necessary.   How else can you account for 3 domestic infant adoptions one year in South Australia when there were hundreds in a state with 4x the population population in the U.S.?<br>  <br>  "Adoption is the ultimate rape of the female condition”. -- Dr Geoffrey Rickarby<br>  <br>  "Adoption is a violent act, a political act of aggression towards a woman who has supposedly offended the sexual mores by committing the unforgivable act of not suppressing her sexuality, and therefore not keeping it for trading purposes through traditional marriage. The crime is a grave one, for she threatens the very fabric of our society. The penalty is severe. She is stripped of her child by a variety of subtle and not so subtle manoeuvres and then brutally abandoned." - Joss Shawyer, Death by Adoption, Cicada Press (1979)|`|iVcaB9h7aa	The first thing I think is "family".

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Just keep an eye on her.<br>  <br>  Realistically an 8 month old is not going to starve quietly.  If all she is getting is breastmilk, which is all she needs, then she will ensure she gets enough breastmilk.  If she were eating other foods and liquids then it is possible she wouldn't be drinking enough breastmilk and even though not "starving" she might not get the correct amount of nutrients, fat, and calories from her diet if breastmilk intake is insufficient.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp</a><br>  I encounter this situation frequently in my office. Many parents have the misconception that all infants will be ready for foods between 4 and 6 months of age. The truth is that very few infants are developmentally ready at 4 months. In addition, it is now recommended to delay foods until 6 months in order to decrease the chance of allergies. I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months. You can click here to read about what signs to watch for to determine when your infant is ready for foods. Breast milk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life. This means that infants can go for at least a year on breast milk alone, without eating any foods, and be nutritionally complete. Offering foods between 6 and 12 months of age is simply for social development and to get infants used to eating. <br>  <br>  <br>  ---------<br>  The Distractible Baby<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/distractible-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/dis...</a><br>  <br>  ----------<br>  Nursing Strikes<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby/back-to-breast.html#linksstrike" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...</a><br>  <br>  --------<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/babyselfwean.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/babys...</a><br>  True SELF-weaning before a baby is a year old is very uncommon. In fact, it is unusual for a baby to wean before 18-24 months unless mom is encouraging weaning. However, it is very common to hear a mother say that her baby self-weaned at 9 or 10 months old, or even earlier. How do we reconcile these statements?<br>   <br>  What is self-weaning?<br>  <br>  A baby who is weaning on his own:<br>  <br>      * is typically well over a year old (more commonly over 2 years)<br>      * is at the point where he gets most of his nutrition from solids<br>      * drinks well from a cup<br>      * cuts down on nursing gradually<br>  <br>  Child-led weaning occurs when a child no longer has a need to nurse - nutritionally or emotionally. The solids part should rule out self-weaning in babies under a year since, for optimum health and brain development, babies under a year should be getting most of their nutrition from breastmilk.<br>  <br>   <br>  What factors might lead mom to think that her baby is self-weaning?<br>  <br>  When a mother says that her baby self-weaned before a year, there is a chance that she interpreted a normal developmental stage (perhaps combined with her own wishes) as baby's wish to wean. Low milk supply can also play a part.<br>  Low milk supply<br>  <br>  If mom's milk supply is reduced, baby may become less interested in nursing, and of course decreased nursing will lead to an even lower milk supply. If milk supply is low, baby may grow to prefer a cup or bottle simply because he can get more milk this way. As long as baby is nursing on cue and removing milk thoroughly, mom's breasts will produce the milk that baby needs. There are a number of things that might interfere with the milk production process after lactation has been established. Some factors that commonly come into play in baby's second six months include:<br>  <br>      * Scheduled feedings or other things that reduce baby's nursing frequency too much (for example, pacifier overuse or sleep training). The answer to "how much is too much?" will depend on the particular mother-baby pair. A consistent decrease in nursing frequency will signal your body to decrease milk supply.<br>      * Rapid weight loss. A sudden decrease in mom's calorie intake can result in decreased milk supply.<br>      * Medications or herbs that reduce milk supply (hormonal contraceptives, for example).<br>      * Early introduction of solids (before 6 months). Besides interfering with baby's immunologic health, solids before six months often results in baby taking less milk at the breast and thus results in a decrease in milk supply.<br>      * Overly rapid increase in the amounts of solids. Again, this results in baby taking too little milk at the breast and thus a decreased milk supply. Keep in mind that mom's milk supply will naturally and gradually decrease as baby begins to eat greater quantities of solid foods - this is fine and expected. What you want to avoid is increasing solids/decreasing milk supply too quickly, as breastmilk is what baby needs for proper growth, health and brain development through the first year and beyond.<br>  <br>  For more on milk supply, including how to increase it, see Got Milk?<br>  Normal developmental stages<br>  <br>  It is common and normal for babies to show less interest in breastfeeding sometime during the second six months. This is developmental and not an indication that baby wishes to stop nursing.<br>  <br>  Older babies tend to b

The airbags can go off even if they are turned off.<br>  <br>  And if he was forward facing that is illegal.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well maybe you should have asked a supervisor if you are allowed to say something, or ask what the rules are on such a situation. i don't know if it's illegal but air bag or no air bag it's still horribly unsafe.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	no you shouldn't have said anything, and it's only legal if the front passenger air bag has been deactivated.|`|0de60a89e9f7e2a8a9c90ff78512aa34aa	Yes its illegal and you should tell her something.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	she may not know -give her a copy of your state's laws.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	Some people would rather be able to see the baby.  Sometimes a newborn's - especially a premature one's, breathing can become obstructed in the angle of the carseat.  If there's no air bag, or an air bag that is turned off, it isn't a problem.  Mercedes use to make infant seats that had a sensor in it to disable the front passenger airbag when installed.  So I've vote for minding your own business rather than potentially looking the interfering fool.|`|JjU4L8L7aa	it is illegal you are right but i will say this i had a 2 door mustang when i first got pregnant (dont worry i knew i couldnt keep it), and the seats in the back are bucket seats and somewhat slanted down and a carseat wont go in there unless you were to stuff towels or something... but it is illegal and i definately wouldnt do it... i mightve said to her that it is illegal and dangerous, but you never know how someone will respond|`|Hf5doDxsaa	I'm not sure if it's illegal, but its definitely unsafe.  Was the baby in a car seat?  I have a Honda Civic and my car seat barely fits in the back, maybe that's the reason.  Just trying to play devil's advocate-it's seems like common knowledge that you don't put a baby in front.|`|ADEDkCgOaa	you can have a car seat in the front seat if the air bag is off. i wouldnt do it but people do. you could have recommended that the back seat is safer for kids.
pvH3oHRfaa	I would ask to try a different pill, as different types can have different effects. It could be the pill you're taking that is giving you particularly bad pmt.<br>  <br>  Mine made me eat my own weight in food a day, so I gave that one up!<br>  <br>  If you do swap though, you may have to use another form of contraceptive along side it for a week or so, until it's been established.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go without the pill for a month because as you've experienced, you can so easily fall pregnant.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I would go to your doctor and get a different prescription.  There are lots of different pills out there, and they can find one that will work with you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|L2t7Ek4paa	This is kinda something you should be taking to your doctor isn't it? Not all birth control pills are the same so, maybe you can get prescribed something else?
LbNXxRXnaa	I love Secret Life!! :D<br>  <br>   In a way it is, but in a way it isn't. I wish they would portray Grace in a different way. Not all Christians are like that. <br>  <br>  And wtf? How can I be like Adrienne? Gawwshh people. <br>  Haha yeahh you should do that. <br>  <br>  Congrats on the baby :D <br>  <br>  And I'm not really sure. I hope she does. I don't like Ben. It seems like he has no respect for himself. EVERYTHING he does revolves around Amy.|`|pcjOQDymaa	that show is sooo bad its not even funny.<br>  the acting is terrible, but i actually like the plot.|`|0xiHNsmVaa	I don't like it because it stereotypes Christians/Catholics and the acting is so bad.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i love that show.<br>  i don't like the typical stereotypes though.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I think after seeing the way Adrien acts, girls are going to STOP acting that way.<br>  Grace is overly christian. She relies on God for everything.<br>  I think Amy will keep the baby. I'm sad Donovan and Leon backed out of the adoption though because I really liked them.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i like the show too, but i do think it gives a bad example for the teens that watch it. honestly i think she's going to choose to keep the baby.|`|8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	I don't think it teaches girls to be like Adrian (spell it right guys) but it does teach the difficulties of teen pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I heard somewhere that she definitely keeps the baby.|`|6of3tqHhaa	No I think it shows what happens in every high school across the US.  I think its telling people to be careful.<br>  <br>  I think Amy's gonna keep the baby|`|7XBoIgd6aa	I think it's no worse than any thing else out there. Plus it shows the struggles of being a teenage mom not just the upside of motherhood|`|tKfOcgDlaa	I don't really think it is but that's just me.|`|cdAQZJGpaa	yes i do and i hope she keeps it!|`|t1NmFX3Kaa	i think she is going to keep it|`|YHwAOEUYaa	never watched it<br>  BUT I DOUBT ANYONE IN THIS WORLD SITS THERE AND THINKS "WOW SHE GET PREGNANT ON TV I CAN TOO" so media can not be blamed|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I like the show, I like how they are open to ideas. I like the idea that they are okay with a gay couple, I like the idea that the gay couple is looking into foster care, I like how they showed that some adoptive parents are not a good fit. There is a lot of good ideas being shown.<br>  <br>  I don't like some parts of it though. You don't really see most of the struggles Amy would face. You don't see her running out of class to pee, you don't see people making fun of her, you don't see her doctor appointments, her paying copays to see her doctor or what kind of coverage she has. <br>  <br>  I don't like they imply a stay at home mom who reenters the work force years later would be stuck making minimum wage, or why a woman would even look that route. I don't like a lot about the show. Its just not real enough.<br>  <br>  I think the show makes teen pregnancy not seem like a huge deal and that part bothers me.<br>  <br>  Oh, and because the season finale is coming up and not the series finale I am guessing they are planning to keep the baby. Two seasons of pregnancy is believable, anything more and they are pushing it. She should be in labor by the season finale.|`|xv3opX9Maa	the show is called the secret life of the american teenager but the parents know most of whats going on <br>  it dosnt portray the real secret life of an american teenager at all <br>  watch a movie on lifetime called "thirteen" <br>  thats the real secret life of an american teenager<br>  <br>  and i do think its a bad influence because amys pregenant but everything is still ok and she dosnt have any real consequences exept having to get a job and they kinda make it look "cool" because if you put sumthing on tv of corse people are gonna wanna be like what they see on tv <br>  all that said i still like the show and adrien is my favorite character<br>  ( =
8t8NjjnVaa	No.  you're not pregnant, but you're certainly too young to be having sex if you don't know the answer to your own question.  <br>  <br>  If you've been on the pill at least two weeks, you should be safe.  Whether you take the inactive pills or not, it doesn't matter.  They are inactive...meaning they are just a sugar pill.  They put them in the pack so you have a pill to take every day so you don't forget.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	chances are slim <br>  but most likely no <br>  just keep taking ur pills <br>  and u cant find out if ur pregnant until u miss ur period|`|3RFu4W38aa	If you have been taking your birth control correctly for at least a week or two, you should be safe, but because nothing is 100%, wait for your period. If you end up more than a week late, get a pregnancy test. Honestly, though, I think your chances of being pregnant are slim (provided you took your bc correctly). Best of luck, try not to worry too much!|`|ablriuUVaa	the key word is u didnt take the inactive pill<br>  if u hadent taken a active pill yet if be worried<br>  <br>  if u wanna play it safe do like my gf did once we were woprried, take the morning after pill<br>  <br>  i think ur pretty safe|`|KIZVWREHaa	no but if you want better coverage get an iud or the 3 month depo shot . Those are more reliable .|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Your on the pill relax.|`|zkbBdUXQaa	You are 100% NOT pregnant. 3 very obvious reasons...#1 you only get pregnant on your fertile days when you ovulate, this happens 2 days out of each month a few days after your period. #2 Unless his penis was inside you without a condom and he came 100% inside the chances are you cant be pregnant...when a man cums his penis shoots it up something a finger is not capable of doing. # 3 Active pills are the ones that matter if you took, the inactive pills are FIBER pills kinda like vitamins just to help you stay in track with taking a pill that same time everyday.|`|dYB98nYFaa	well usually it takes a full month for birth control pills to get into your system so there is kind of a little chance they havent quite made it. but if he just got some on his finger chances are you didnt get pregnate. It is possible but the chances are slim to none. If you are really worried about it go to planned parenthood. they are totally confidental and they have an emergency pill you take up to 48 hours after an accident that helps in the prevention of pregnancy.|`|88581cf566c30acddb7ffe0f4e82d631aa	Chances are you're not pregnant.  It does take 30 days for the pills to be effective, but if you've finished the active pills you shouldn't be too concerned.  Once your inactive pills are gone, expect your period within a day or two after your last inactive pill.  If it doesn't come, get a test just to be safe, but I don't think you're pregnant.|`|Bt8IxwCpaa	It's a little too soon to tell, but you should have taken a plan B pill. You still can, if you do it within the next few days. Your birth control still isn't working right. Your suposed to wait at least a month before letting ejaculate get inside of you. If you don't start your period a few days after taking the in-active pills, then you might be pregnant.|`|OakU4oACaa	It depends on how long it was on his finger, and a bunch of other factors. Sperm dies when it hits air, but not like right away. I would either get a pregnancy test from a store, or go to your gyno. I would say probably not, but there definitely is a chance..|`|J2bnw5EZaa	99% no<br>  But I have seen stranger things.  You should be ok....just keep an eye out for your period.  If you are seriously paranoid, you can try the morning after pill.  I don't know much about it but I saw a commercial on it.|`|MQp40L2gaa	got what on his finger??? If you mean *** then the awnser is no... your on the pill so I think your covered, if not wait a few days and take a pregnancy test|`|hyPUd72Raa	no..<br>  <br>  also if you have to ask a question like this you really shouldn't be having sex.|`|cpuydZvNaa	probably not so keep an eye on it and keep asking questions
KlJHZRSiaa	Insurance policies differ so greatly, the only way to know is to call them up and ask about this. Most of the time you need the doctor to sign off that whatever you're having is 'medically necessary; and they would certainly do that for one 20-week scan (although I suspect, not for another one if you simply 'felt like having it'.) But in short, be sure to call the insurance company because the last thing you want to find out is that they don't cover all maternity issues. Be safe!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	The new insurance would request a copy of the 20 week ultra sound from the previous insurance. They won't do a whole new one.
MR9iBgafaa	Your baby is still getting used to the outside world.  My baby hated supermarkets and I had to hold her round the store.  She's 5 months old now and has more patience. <br>  <br>  Also enjoy this time when she wants to be held by you. My baby wouldn't let me out her down, but now she wriggles out of my arms and hates to be cradled!  They grow independent before you know it, so enjoy it!<br>  <br>  Speaking of which mine's now waking up - I can hear her babbling to herself upstairs!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well first off; realize that this is a totally new world, new environment for her; she's only been here seven weeks, mom is recognized by her smell, her voice, her face; so she feels secure when she is held by or laying on mom, at other times she feels insecure ,bc she feels alone without mommy; i would suggest strongly that you get some wraps called 'swaddle me' s by kiddopotamus, you can get them for ten bucks at brus, and i am sure you can fine them online if you google them...they are better than swaddling blankets, bc they don't come loose no matter how much baby tries to move and they feel more secure bc they were so cramped in the uterus and it suppresses the startle reflex which constantly wakes them up....use these when you are going to put baby down for nap or bedtime....mine cried as i put them on, and then when snug, settled right down; we gave her  a passy and she was out; i truly believe these are why she has  ALWAYS slept through the night....when you have tired arms, i suggest a baby bjorn with back support; baby can sleep on your chest and hear your heartbeat (another thing she recognizes) and sleep while you have 2 hands free...slings didn't work for me, but some swear by them...i have back probs and i can still carry my dd for hours in it and she's nine mos now, and she does and always has slept in it when she got tired...she even slept through all the noise and fireworks at the fair in it!! as for the car, she will probably grown out of it, but occasionally my dd will do that but not often, maybe she wasn't feeling well, was tired, overtired, overstimulated, remember, naps are very important to a happy baby as well..etc.....gl, hth|`|6AvVVzsnaa	No she's just being a baby.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Little babies need to be held allot. She isn't spoiled and she isn't a cry baby that's just what they do when they are little. Also she may have colic, they cry all the time when they have colic. Take her to the dr and see whats wrong with her. She maybe sick. Also sit in the back seat with her if you can. Thats what I did and Lauren, I rode in back with her and kept on hand on her to make sure she knew I was there.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	please come here so i can punch you in the face<br>  <br>  <br>  you cannot spoil a 7 week old newborn.<br>  <br>  <br>  IDIOT.|`|oECHtfYUaa	just because a baby cries doesn't mean you have to pick her up. she may have colic and you should take her to the dr. to rule that out. sometimes creating a relaxing atmosphere, dim lights, soft music, maybe a warm bath and try some of that lavender baby wash. lavender and chamomile are very relaxing and soothing to the senses. i remember when my son was less than a yr old and he would wake up in the middle of the night fussy, a drive would calm him down. but you also have to keep in mind that your baby is only 7 weeks, some babies cry alot if they are not comforted, do you still swaddle her? picking her up everytime she cries is not good because she is going to expect that all the time. it's ok to let them cry as long as they are not in any danger. welcome to motherhood!|`|qzEva4H7aa	Despite all you hear you cannot spoil a baby by cuddling it and holding when it needs you, like the previous answer it's a  transition. Try swaddling her, my oldest son used to calm down almost instantly when swaddled. My youngest used to scream a lot in the vehicle too it was hard to go anywhere, but he outgrew it. Dr. HArvey Karp as a good book out called " the Happiest Baby on the Block", very useful book!!|`|OfLyP6mgaa	She's just a normal baby. Remember, 7 weeks ago she was INSIDE of you. She's just transitioning into the world, and sometimes she just may need some extra love and comfort. She'll do fine. She's just adjusting. :)|`|hIoxij6eaa	She's a baby. babies can cry a lot! She's probably used to being home now and being out and about was probably overstimulating for her. At this stage she needs comfort and reassurance from you. You will not spoil her with holding her and giving her what she needs. Most babies like to sleep, feed, cuddle, sleep, feed, cuddle....... that doesn't leave much time for shopping, having coffee etc so it can be difficult to find a good time to do these things, and when you do, you find that you rush through it. Make sure she hasn't had too much going on before you leave, make sure that she is fed, burped, clean and dry and hopefully she will sleep for you in the car. Maybe a cd of some soothing music in the car will help settle her. I have found that a baby carrier or a sling is good for when they are little they feel secure and leaves your hands free.<br>  Remember, YOU CANNOT SPOIL A TINY BABY, that comes much later.
3lt167Ucaa	Just start on your homework. If you have to read a lot and you begin to fall asleep, it's okay to take a little nap (like 15 minutes or so). Make sure you wake up though. It should be easy to stay awake if you have to do work though, like writing or working problems. Just try to stay focused on getting your work done and you'll be surprised at how fast time flies.|`|T9fek24eaa	I think its pretty hilarious that this is posted in the "newborn/baby" section! I dont understand why you are trying to stay up because you missed a week of school? What does that have to do with anything? Like you already said, if you are going to school you really should be trying to sleep at night, other wise you are going to be falling asleep all through school.|`|5SlDYsVPaa	Drink Sodas? That may help a little. Get rag and bowl of water... Wipe your face every once in a while. It is very hard not to get off track. Turn on your iTunes... that will help... if you don't have iTunes, go to www.Pandora.com... it will play music you like. Have fun staying up!|`|ehkgEhnvaa	take your ipod and listen to the music...really loud..>?<br>  slap your face?? <br>  the best would be drink coffee ..|`|lD0VcAlpaa	Uh.....

okh3hL8taa	She has the right to spend HER  money the way SHE chooses whether you like it or not.  If she chooses to spend HER money on her other siblings children so be it.  You don't get to dictate how she spends her money or who she makes purchases for.  When she wants to show you something she bought for one of the other children simply tell her you're not interested and walk away.|`|w5NLtWUPaa	no i dont think shes being rude because as a parent you have to bye things for ur kids and not make other people buy your kids things just bc you feel like they should have the same things that the other people have and i dont like to hug and kiss babbies either so i understand that people dont want to do that maybe you should by your kids stuff so that they can have more things and not want things or be jealous of kids or maybe you should tell them that just because other people hav more money than they get more stuff|`|7imMv3Niaa	depends - i never bought for my bros kids till they were older now my sis has kids and i will do the same (have them get equal by age not year) so my sis feels left out.<br>  <br>  find out what she is thinking. ask by proxy so as not to b a confrontation. go via your husbands other sis to ask.|`|OflbswHKaa	Maybe its hard for her to express affection towards other children, or just other people in general. If its a problem, i would have your husband confront her on it. I think it would come off bad if you said something.|`|YJH5YcjBaa	yeah that has been happening with me and my sister with my dads family our whole lifes....its because my dads the son ...and the daughters kids are always treated with favoritism....its not like i want the gifts but i just wish they'd ''hide'' it from us..everyone, aunts ,uncles, granparents alway gives them better treatment..for my cousins 7th birthday she got 50 dollars ...for my high school graduation i got 40...its mean, when i turned 17 they gave me 4.53 on a macys gift card, its like whaaaaat i dont need this, but you know what, ehhh i dont need there cr*p....its favoritism and inevitable...but yeah it hurtss oh well we dont pick our family, only friends
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	1) You can safely pump or breastfeed during pregnancy.  It won't cause preterm labour<br>  <br>  2) You will make colostrum until 24-72 hours after birth no matter what.  Your baby NEEDS colostrum so your body makes colostrum.  There is no harm in pumping or directly nursing an older nursling when you have colostrum.<br>  <br>  I have absolutely no clue what you mean by "decent" milk supply.  Colostrum IS breastmilk, moms make more of it than the baby (or babies) would need.  Colostrum is more nutritious than "mature" milk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/05pumping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/0...</a><br>  Is it safe to use a breastpump during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  It is often stated that a woman should not use a breastpump when pregnant. However, there is considerable reason to believe that pumping, like breastfeeding, will not trigger preterm labor in a healthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  When contemplating pumping during pregnancy, it is important to consider your motives for doing so. In general, when it comes to pumping during pregnancy, your efforts are best directed elsewhere unless you are pumping to provide milk for your current nursling.<br>  <br>      * If you are pumping to provide milk for your current nursling when you are separated, this should not pose more of a problem than breastfeeding. Many working moms continue to pump through pregnancy, although pumping output will decrease due to the hormonal changes of pregnancy. Aim to keep your pumping in scale with what you were doing before pregnancy, or in scale with your baby's normal breastfeeding. Sustained and intense pumping is more of an unknown and is not recommended.<br>      * If you wish to put some expressed milk in the freezer for your unborn child, keep in mind that pumping is not likely to be very productive during pregnancy. Milk supply and pumping output will decrease due to the hormonal changes of pregnancy.<br>      * Pumping prior to birth will not increase milk production for your unborn child or otherwise enhance lactation after birth.<br>      * If you are hoping to induce labor, it is known that nipple stimulation at term (38+ weeks) can be helpful for ripening the cervix and inducing labor.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/colostrum.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/colostrum.html</a><br>  Colostrum actually works as a natural and 100% safe vaccine. It contains large quantities of an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) which is a new substance to the newborn. Before your baby was born, he received the benefit of another antibody, called IgG, through your placenta. IgG worked through the baby's circulatory system, but IgA protects the baby in the places most likely to come under attack from germs, namely the mucous membranes in the throat, lungs, and intestines.<br>  <br>  Colostrum has an especially important role to play in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. A newborn's intestines are very permeable. Colostrum seals the holes by "painting" the gastrointestinal tract with a barrier which mostly prevents foreign substances from penetrating and possibly sensitizing a baby to foods the mother has eaten.<br>  <br>  Colostrum also contains high concentrations of leukocytes, protective white cells which can destroy disease-causing bacteria and viruses.<br>  <br>  The colostrum gradually changes to mature milk during the first two weeks after birth. During this transition, the concentrations of the antibodies in your milk decrease, but your milk volume greatly increases. The disease-fighting properties of human milk do not disappear with the colostrum. In fact, as long as your baby receives your milk, he will receive immunological protection against many different viruses and bacteria.<br>  Stomach capacity of the newborn<br>  <br>  When mothers hear that colostrum is measurable in teaspoons rather than ounces, they often wonder if that can really be enough for their babies. The short answer is that colostrum is the only food healthy, full-term babies need. The following is an explanation:<br>  <br>  A 1 day old baby's stomach capacity is about 5-7 ml, or about the size of a marble. Interestingly, researchers have found that the day-old newborn's stomach does not stretch to hold more. Since the walls of the newborn's stomach stays firm, extra milk is most often expelled (spit up). Your colostrum is just the right amount for your baby's first feedings!<br>  <br>  By day 3, the newborn's stomach capacity has grown to about 0.75-1 oz, or about the size of a "shooter" marble. Small, frequent feedings assure that your baby takes in all the milk he needs.<br>  <br>  Around day 7, the newborn's stomach capacity is now about 1.5-2 oz, or about the size of a ping-pong ball. Continued frequent feeding will assure that your baby takes in all the milk he needs, and your milk production meets his demands.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/16milkchanges.html#colostrum" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/1...</a><br>  Will I produce colostrum?<br>  <br>  Yes. The changeover between mature milk and colostrum production begins, on average, between the 4th and 8th month of pregnancy, but some mothers start producing colostrum somewhat earlier than that. Many mothers who nurse through pregnancy have noted that their milk contains mostly colostrum during the last month before baby is born. You will continue to produce colostrum throughout the latter part of your pregnancy - your older nursling cannot "use it up."|`|X6as2nOAaa	milk doesn't arrive until the baby comes and you wouldn't want to pull out the colostrum anyways that is healthier for the baby then the milk. So don't pump that out.|`|eRlNQxbNaa	When your baby is born he or she will only be able to eat very tiny amounts at one time so actually the colostrum is perfect! It also has all sorts of brilliant nutrients so don't waste it by pumping it before the baby arrives.  Pumping could also cause your uterus to contract leading to labor so I would advise against it all around.  Your milk will come in time for when baby needs it, don't worry about that. Just wait until baby arrives to share what you have to offer! :)  Good luck!|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	Colostrum continues to be produced until at least 72hrs after birth, regardless of breast pumping before delivery. It can be very harmful to begin pumping too soon before labor actually begins because you can stimulate the hormones putting you into early labor. The only time we recommend to pump before delivering your baby is if you have gone post-dates and your practitioner has recommended this as one of the ways to help bring on labor. It is always best to ask your practitioner and/or a lactation nurse before begining anything new in your pregnancy for the safety of yourself and your precious little one! Hope this helps!!!|`|UghJ0XROaa	If you milk is going to come in, it will come in after birth. It's very rare for a mother's milk to not come in. But pumping before hand will only trigger labor, not increase your milk supply.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	It can trigger labour so I don't advise it.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	You will not actually have breast milk until several days after your baby is born.  Until then you will only have colostrum, and you cannot pump or save it.<br>  <br>  It's not a good idea to try pumping before you give birth because some think stimulating the breasts can trigger labor.

WNZUyqibaa	No, a parent is a parent no matter what, especially if he is paying child support, no court can take away his right to parent, unless he is found unfit to parent(severe mental handicap, incarcerated, heavy drug abuser, etc...) but this would have to be determined by the court. Remember, you chose to have this baby with him so now you need to respect him a a co-parent, especially if you are taking money from him for child support. The Court would be the only ones who can make any decision in the situation, not you.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	You need to write a will.<br>  <br>  In there, you can have details about who will have legal guardianship of your children.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have done this, as then everyone knows what we want.

The only way for him to not get it is for him to allow your sons father to adopt her and but then you will lose your child support..... so you should have thought to yourself...HMMMM  Money today or a better daddy later. No one is ever "automatically added to her birth certificate becuz of the child support" You had the man added yourself when you filed a paternity suit and won. Enjoy your child support.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	"He was automatically added to her birth certificate becuz of the child support."<br>  <br>  <br>  Doesnt make sense, I stopped reading.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Unfortunately, while the courts would consider your wishes it is unlikely that if her bio father choose to fight for custody that he would not be granted it.  I know how you feel.  My 12 year old daughter has a different father than my other kids; however, her dad is in the picture.  If something were to happen to me I would not want her living with him and I would want my kids to stay together but I know he would get her since we have joint custody.
3jUND0jaaa	Yes, it is age appropriate, I babysitted kids that age before too and they asked me if I had some of that stuff so it is safe to say, yes.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	That should be fine.  You probably don't need to bring anything if you are going to be at their house, though, because they probably have toys and movies there.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|895XRbnJaa	yeah those are appropriate things but from my experience you wont need to bring anything|`|GZ9LjS13aa	Wow there so young they wont care about the toys really.<br>  The movies might not be good enough to keep them entertained.<br>  Try movies like shrek, cars, toy story. like Disney or pixar movies works well.<br>  However looks liek the parents want you to do appropriate games.<br>  Try drawing games.<br>  Try interacting with them.<br>  You can try letting them make their own sandwhich, like have them sitting on a table, with everything pre cut, so they can easily just grab what they want to be on their sandwhich. They always have fun with that.
y5sWmbtnaa	Its because of the stretxhing and pulling that your muscles are going through, its sending pain in your nerves down your vaginal walls, it should subside soon.|`|AA10153923	I really, really don't want to scare you because It might be nothing, it could be just stretching. (Which im PRETTY SURE it is)<br>  <br>  But I had those pains, and still have them...<br>  I turned out to have a partially detached placenta that was causing me to have certain pains. But my baby is ok ,I just need to let it rest and let it heal for a while.<br>  <br>  I hope everything is fine!! :)|`|mObCcKogaa	i am 36 weeks pregnant today and im havin pain in my vagina but i guess its just my body preparing for labor i dont know what it could be ive never had that happen to me before but if u are that worried maybe u should call ur doctors and be looked at..|`|xMpkqjicaa	I had this and it could just be stretching ligaments. I would err on the side of safety though. Is it possible to call your clinic's on call doc or widwife?|`|3hChyHo9aa	i goes away soon dw all the best
c4363680d99aa97b5b90edd1a11e17a2aa	my little girl wakes at between 5-6am now for only one feed then every 3-4hrs after that. When I was breastfeeding she wanted fed constantly but my nipples nearly fell off so enough was enough and she's been on a bottle for a while now.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Yes, that's normal. My first did that around the same time. Obviously you wouldn't wake to feed at this age (and you didn't actually mention doing that either....) so I'm sure it won't be too long before she drops the last night-feed! My youngest has been sleeping through since about 4 weeks! yes I do know how lucky I am....|`|vsFJZRkGaa	my son is 5mths, and he cut down his night bottles at 3mths, and started sleeping through the night (12hrs a night approx).<br>  he eats more during the day and doesn't have a feed during the night now.<br>  <br>  hopefully your daughter will let you sleep soon :)|`|YHdjNv87aa	my little girl is the same age as yours and she wakes once a night or sometimes not at all and sleeps till around 6;30-7am. enjoy  the extra hours sleep.|`|dSXS9v7Daa	Once my neice was about 4 weeks old she started sleeping through the night, 11pm last feed then not feeding again until about 9am. Even now at 5 months she will have a feed and go to bed around 6pm, she wakes around midnight then sleeps straight through again untill 7/8ish. If baby needs feeding they will soon let you know! Dont worry about it too much. So long as baby is gaining enough wait they will be fine. x|`|wTeJulT5aa	I think it's normal for that to happen.  My baby started sleeping through the night when she was 2 months old, and she still sleeps very well.  She wakes up once for a bottle, and then I feed her again when we wake up for the day.|`|JrYYd6A2aa	Never EVER wake a sleeping baby for a night feed,, (If their day feeds are Normal)<br>   Baby is telling you she is satisfied to sleep,,, and make the most of it.. as some times it doesnt last for long..<br>  <br>  <br>   As long as  there is a normal  intake of  formula / breast milk occurs during the day,  and you baby is not under weight, LET THEM SLEEP....<br>  <br>   GOOD Luck with your little one,,, and if in doubt, ask your Doctor, or  family health nurse
1OngsVZ9aa	is it a boy or a girl. i'm assuming its a girl.(if its a boy call him titan, trojan or scout). Girl=i'd have to say yours are the best. i like sahde and locke and ashen(maybe ash).<br>  a really cool name is pablo or finbar.|`|AA11330115	The names both of your friends have chosen are good names...tho I don't really like the names Britney or Brianne, or Paige. Kaylen I really like, because that is my niece's name. BUT, the names you chose...I'm sorry, but they all sound unreal. Especially Locke Drachen...it sounds like you made that one up.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you all.|`|fNv2Re6baa	Friend two is the prettiest.........however, I like yours the best because there is the most unusual and interesting names.|`|hV48lhvqaa	I like the names of your friends, but yours sounds a little weird especially gage (how do u pronounce that?).|`|AjqO1aJgaa	So the choice is between not-names, trashy names, and trashy names?<br>  <br>  What a truly dreadful set of choices all round. I'll take "none of them", thanks.|`|t9FzbPyFaa	I am sorry but friend 2 has by far the better names in my opinion. <br>  <br>  here is why:<br>  <br>  Gage is the generally used term in the mechanical engineering field in reference to various instruments for geometric dimensioning and tolerancing<br>  <br>  DRachen is the german word for dragon i think<br>  <br>  shade - its kind of shady, dark, mysterious, if someone is shady they are suspicious<br>  <br>  same with locke - its the opposite of open - its closed in and trapped<br>  <br>  I dont like any of your names, sorry. <br>  <br>  friend one is OK, my fave deing madison nicole<br>  <br>  friend 2 is much better though! She deserves the money!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Yours are better as long as you spell Alexander right. Shane Alexander, Lachlann Drake, and Asher Gage would all be nice. And as long as these are for boys, which I take they are.<br>  <br>  <br>  Madison is a masculine boy's name meaning SON of Maude; Matthew's SON. Nicole is filler. Brittney is dated. Lee is filler. Cassie is a nickname and childish. Lynn is filler.<br>  <br>  Taylor is a masculine boy's name. Tailors were always male. Do not care for Brianne. Dislike Lindsay on a girl. Paige is masculine. Kaylen is made up, and trashy. Danielle is nice.|`|zqxVU9xVaa	Shade - no.<br>  Alexzander - okay<br>  Locke - no.<br>  Drachen - i like it but maybe not for a baby?<br>  Ashen - ditto^<br>  Gage - no.<br>  <br>  <br>  Madison - ehh, not that interesting.<br>  Nicole - ^<br>  Britney - Reminds me of junkies (for some reason. :P)<br>  Lee - It's good for a boy's middle name. Lea - for a girl's<br>  Cassie - is a nickname.<br>  Lynn - Uhhh? -.-<br>  <br>  <br>  Taylor - very pretty girl's name.<br>  Brianne - ditto^<br>  Lindsey - no.<br>  Paige - IMHO i don't like it.<br>  Kaylen - Boring.<br>  Danielle - Honestly a bit boring.<br>  <br>  I like Taylor Brianne as the prettiest name.<br>  <br>  Well that's my opinion. :P|`|eeee2f2fbb78961fe66b645a046c24b0aa	Hmm... I like one from yours and one from friend 2 (Ashen & Kaylen) but friend 1's names are way too plain and boring for my taste. sorry friend 1 :) I'm not sure if yours are for boys or girls, I would hope boys... I'm gonna have to vote for friend 2 even though I hate Lindsey.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & God Bless!|`|N5EhfDX2aa	Well yours are for boys and theres are for girls right? so its different! Well I like yours and friend 1's the best BY FAR! although I hate nicole so I guess you win. Tell your friend 1 that Cassia Lynn is really nice =]
ksXayEUoaa	Imogen and Jude (or Judah)|`|kPl8TTzNaa	I love you forever for using Ashley on a boy!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Maxwell Dean (Max) - Very nice. I love that you are going for a longer Max- name instead of just Max.<br>  <br>  Julian Page (Jude) - Love love Julian and Jude. Not sure if Jude fits as a nickname for Julian, but lovely none the less. And it is so refreshing to see the masculine Page on a boy!<br>  <br>  Jude Robert - Love love love! Absolutely perfect!<br>  <br>  Parker Evan - Not a fan of Parker. Evan is nice.<br>  <br>  Ashley Davis (Ash) - Holy cow! May I kiss you? Someone actually using Ashley on a boy?!!!! Wow. Perfect. Splendid. Absolutely fantastic!<br>  <br>  Charlie Christopher/Charlie James - Charlie is a nickname, not a name. It will not age well. Charles with the nickname Charlie would be far better. Christopher is fine, but I prefer Christian. And I absolutely love James!<br>  <br>  George Cooper - Nice. Not a fan of either, but still nice.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Laura Mackenzie - Laura is lovely. Mackenzie is a masculine boy's name meaning SON of the fair one. Nothing feminine or girly about a name that means SON.<br>  <br>  Sophie Jean - Sophie is a nickname, not a name. It will not age well. Sophia with the nickname Sophie would be far better. Love Jean as a middle.<br>  <br>  Leila [pronounced Lee-la) Christine - Very nice.<br>  <br>  Sally Elizabeth - Not a fan of Sally and Elizabeth is filler.<br>  <br>  Madeleine Esme (Maddie) - Madeleine is lovely! Do not care for Maddie, since all the gender confused, female Madisons will be going by Maddie. Do not care for Esme either. It reminds me of a villain. <br>  <br>  Brennan Amelia - Brennan is masculine. Amelia is gorgeous.<br>  <br>  Bronwyn Grace (Bronnie) - Bronwyn is masculine and reminds me of the color brown. Grace is filler.<br>  <br>  Charlotte Evelyn (Charlie) - Gorgeous!<br>  <br>  Louisa Clare - Gorgeous!<br>  <br>  Kristen Isobel - Christian is a masculine boy's name. Isobel is common.<br>  <br>  Lindsay Bridget - Do not care for Lindsay on a female. Bridget is harsh.<br>  <br>  Peyton Elle - Peyton is a masculine boy's name. Elle is more of a nickname.<br>  <br>  Anne Sabrina (Annie) - Lovely!<br>  <br>  Imogen Reid - I prefer the original, Innogen. Reid is masculine.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Sorry but, while I agree Ashley originated as a male name, it has gained far much more popularity for girls to make it usable on that side again. I'd try something far more handsome and masculine like Asher.<br>  <br>  That said, Maxwell, Jude Robert, & Charlie James are gorgeous!<br>  <br>  Also, Charlotte Evelyn is perfection. <3<br>  <br>  I also really like Bronwyn Grace, Mackenzie, Sophie, Christine, Elizabeth, Madeleine Esme, Louisa Clare, Kristen Isobel, Lindsay Bridget, & Anna.<br>  <br>  You have very nice taste overall.<br>  <br>  Edit;; Oh, and Sophie is NOT a nickname. It's a full, legit French name on its own (It is the French form of Sophia), that did not originate as a nickname for it.<br>  <br>  Also, where did ANYONE get the idea that Bronwyn is masculine? Because it "looks" masculine to you? No offense guys, but if you're all going to spout out holier-than-thou advice on baby names, at least get your facts straight. Bronwyn is a feminine Welsh name.|`|2bcZbaQQaa	Well I would never name a boy Ashley, this isn't the 1800's anymore, it's a girl name not a boy name.  Naming a boy ashley is just asking for him to get teased and picked on.  Do you want to do that to your son?<br>  <br>  The only boy name I do like from your list is George, but not Cooper.<br>  <br>  The girl names I like are...<br>  <br>  Laura Mackenzie<br>  Sophie Jean<br>  Leila [pronounced Lee-la) Christine<br>  Kristen Isobel<br>  Peyton Elle|`|zqxVU9xVaa	Ashley (Dean) and Sophie/Sophia (Grace)|`|eeee2f2fbb78961fe66b645a046c24b0aa	BOYS:<br>  Maxwell Dean (Max) Like this one! Nice combo!<br>  Julian Page (Jude) Not a fan of girl names for boys (Page)<br>  Jude Robert - Love Jude but don't care for Robert. Just my taste though.<br>  Parker Evan - Cute but pretty popular right now.<br>  Ashley Davis (Ash) - Prefer Ashton, Ashley sounds too feminine.<br>  Charlie Christopher/Charlie James - Charlie James flows better.  Charles James is even a better flow. <br>  George Cooper - Love Cooper but not George, even though it is my grandpas name :) <br>  <br>  GIRLS:<br>  Laura Mackenzie - Cute Mackenzie is my future niece's name.<br>  Sophie Jean - nice and sweet.<br>  Leila [pronounced Lee-la) Christine - Love Leila but not Christine.<br>  Sally Elizabeth - Don't like it.<br>  Madeleine Esme (Maddie) - just ok for me.<br>  Brennan Amelia - nah.<br>  Bronwyn Grace (Bronnie) - unique. At first look Bronwyn looks masculine.<br>  All of these are just not my taste but to each his own right? I like less traditional, more modern names.<br>  Charlotte Evelyn (Charlie)<br>  Louisa Clare<br>  Kristen Isobel<br>  Lindsay Bridget<br>  Peyton Elle<br>  Anne Sabrina (Annie)<br>  Imogen Reid<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck & God Bless!|`|0bSghnrtaa	My favorites are; Parker Evan & Peyton Elle. Funny how they both have the same initials lol. :)

pwu9xzF8aa	i would love to have a home birth!! but, when i had my daughter last year i was living with my mother and 5 siblings- so a home birth was out lol. Due to give birth in july, and although we are in our own place, its a squishy block of units so thats thrown me off this time lol.<br>  yes, all problems will be managed the same at hospital and at home. If complications were to arise, they usually would get some notice before it happened- midwives doing the home births take no risks and are extra cautious- so if there is any chance u would need a doctor or extra care, they will have an ambulance on the way before u know whats going on!!<br>  (i had lots of talks with the midwives about a homebirth as i wanted one lol)<br>  the problems that arose with your last two would be treated exactly the same! good luck! just remember- you are the one going through the delivery, so you need to do what makes you most comfortable. Your partner may be worried about the baby, but assure him u would never do anything to harm the baby. Best of luck!|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Personally I wouldn't choose a home birth, but then this is my first child. Who knows, if all goes well I may consider it next time... But for now I'm too scared, particularly with my health issues.<br>  <br>  It's a choice that isn't easy to make for a lot of people. Do you risk something going wrong and not having the medical support needed? Or do you go into hospital and have a totally straightforward birth and regret not doing it at home?<br>  As long as you're confident in your situation and happy that your midwife can take everything in their hands then there's no reason not to do it... Other than your own personal comfort levels :)|`|OfLyP6mgaa	Not for me! I can honestly say that I think my son would have been still-born if I had not had him at the hospital. About 2 hours before he was born, his heart decelerated into the 80's, and then stopped. It turned out he was laying on the umbilical cord and not getting any oxygen. Everything turned out fine due to the quick reactions of the nurses and doctors, but it gives me chlls to think what could have happened without the technology to indicate what was happening!|`|8b312325be01e2ee18a694dc156bcc3daa	no way go to a dr no wat for you be responsible for that BABY so no|`|vg33S1YTaa	If you have a healthy pregnancy and a midwife you trust, it can be a magical experience.  I just had my first baby, at home, in May 08'.  Sounds like you already know what to expect, so that's the hard part.  What most don't realize is the amount of equipment midwifes bring with them.  It's not just some hippy lady with braids and birkenstocks helping you out!  <br>  I was able to eat, move freely, and push in a position I wanted (standing).  I got to catch my son, hold him first, bond for hours before cleaning him up...take a bath together a few hours later...and the midwife and doula cleaned our house, did the laundry and cooked us a great meal afterwards!  I wouldn't do it any other way.
wKuQC4yTaa	I'd worry more about all the bad comments your gonna get on a PREGNANCY forum.....|`|sk46uigvaa	What method of Contraception are you using now?<br>  If you had the deprovera injection after the procedure then this could be the reason, or the pill?<br>  <br>  You should have a 6 week checkup, so perhaps mention it then, if your worried speak to a doctor asap.<br>  <br>  Im sure everything is fine though|`|br0gCYDBaa	From what I have been told yes. It similar to giving birth and your hormone levels have changed to this throws everything out of wack.<br>  I wouldn't worry unless you get a fever or intense cramps.<br>  If you go on birth control it will help line you back out quicker and may keep you from having to have another abortion. Somthing to consider.|`|UqDIhxcdaa	Things may have changed inside speaking because you were pregnant because maybe things stretched or stuff. If it gets heavy or you don't have another one maybe you should go to the doctor.|`|KiWJxGYtaa	Wow what a loser!
14JQ11AUaa	Owy! I had this happen to me a 2 weeks before I delivered! I was 1 cm and 50% effaced at 35 weeks...delivered naturally at 38 1/2! It is totally normal, although it doesn't feel that way lol. It LITERALLY felt like my son was trying to punch his way out of my vagina...really it did. Is this your first baby??  I think you will be snuggling that lil baby of your within 2 weeks...keep me updated :) Congrats!|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	First... call your doctor to find out what they want you to do.<br>  <br>  I had something similar happen a few weeks ago.  I thought for sure I was having the baby.  The doc told me to drink pleny of fluids (dehydration can cause early labor), lay down or take a warm bath and see if the contractions stop.  If they do stop or ease up, you are not in labor.  Sure enough, after an hour of laying down and drinking a couple of glasses of water I was back to normal.  <br>  <br>  As far as the shooting pain, baby may be on a nerve.  Doctor will know if this is a serious condition.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|fOQ2TDIeaa	I have had many babies, I had a sharp stabbing pain shooting downward towards my vagina, late in my pregnancies. I don't know if this is what you are feeling. Its sounds like its just the last stages of your pregnancy. You know where in pain and tired and you just want your body back. Anxious to see your lil bundle of joy.<br>  Try taking warm showers and walking. Sex helps, too, if your in the mood.<br>  Best Wishes.|`|POGZZmoUaa	You don't say if you are dilated.  Effaced is just the thinning of the uterine wall.  These are all normal signs in pregnancy.  If you are concerned then call your doctor and get some reassurance.|`|78FXygtoaa	do you get it when you sit up or lay down or move your legs? because i am experiencing the same thing! lol|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	You have to call your doctor if you having any problem or pain it's very important to let your doctor know.
0iUxfCMcaa	its a very good thing when they have hiccups it means they are practicing breathing by breathing in the fluids. so think of it this way, your baby is practicing breathing before she comes out :) very good sign|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's not an irritation, your baby is practicing breathing and swallowing the amniotic fluid which results in them having hiccups, it's completely normal and definitely healthy.|`|4GwTDea1aa	The baby gets fetal hiccups because you little bundle of joy is practicing breathing and in doing so swallowing amniotic fluid.. which is perfectly fine! Enjoy them its the most amazing feeling to have! My Baby has em bout 5 times a day..!<br>  Good Luck!
fNv2Re6baa	I'm really not sure if thats actually her name......but if it is she should get it changed! <br>  <br>  I haven't heard any odd names like that before, however, my cousin is great friends with a set of twins called 'Strawberri and Kreem'! I nearly wet my pants laughing! <br>  <br>  If your friends name really was Ima Hooker, than yes, that would definitly have to say that is the worst name I've ever heard! The poor girl.|`|jIuKF41baa	Hands down, Honoria for a girl, Gaylord for a boy.  Honoria sounds like an STD or diarrhea and who wants to be the lord of the gays?|`|cd8j7Guaaa	Lol well... i once heard that this kids moms last name you to be hiscock, and her 1st name was Sher...

5C3zkmDOaa	Bless your heart!  I know what it is like to be suffering physically and still have a baby in the NICU.  Our 5th child was born at 26 weeks and 3 days.  I have gone thorugh a lot to have these precious kids. If I could do it all over, I would have charted a different course. However, my first birth experience was colored by bossy hospital staff.<br>    PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!  That is generally what first-time moms hear and that is the biggest culprit of episiotomies.  Well-meaning staff often man-handle labors and I am convinced that this generally has bad results.  Believe it or not, tearing hurts less and heals easier.  I have heard doctors try to tell patients otherwise, but I have never witnessed an episiotomy that healed better than a tear.  Episiotomies cut against the natural grain of the muscles.  Tears move with the structure of the muscle, therefore, they can heal much easier.  There is also a tendency for them to be much shorter in length.<br>    I understand the fears you have.  My first child was 9 lbs and 8 ox at birth, so the attending physician (not even a doctor as they later deemed to tell me) cut and cut and cut, thinking that natural birth was not possible.  Instead of turning me onto my hands and knees (a position best for birthing larger babies), he cut through the bowels, an action requiring major stitching afterward.  In fact, I could not sit down pain free in any position or at any speed without pain for about three months after the birth.  Sixteen years later, I continue to suffer from the effects of that episiotomy, though the pain itself is long gone.  However, the minor tears (I went on to vaginally birth five more children) healed and have never caused more problems.  Shake off the fears with knowledge!  Learn about maternal positioning.  A good site to assist you there is www.spinningbabies.com  Go to sites on natural childbirth and find out more about perineal support from folks who know how.  Look up infomation on how to deliver a large or malpositioned baby.  The techniques needed to deliver a large one will also help you deliver a smaller baby with less risk of tearing.  Consider avoiding medication that causes reduced feeling in the perineal area.  My last birth, a relaxed home birth, did not have the classic "ring of fire" and I did not tear one bit!   In fact, if you can find a midwife, don't be afraid to use her expertise!|`|DIXhpf5Haa	A previous episiotomy can make you more prone to tearing, but not another episiotomy.  Episiotomies are almost never necessary, but unfortunately drs seem to like doing them.  Tell your dr that you want perineal support during the crowning stage, and want self-directed pushing rather than purple pushing.  A slow, controlled delivery of the head will greatly reduce your risk of tearing.|`|ox6SXta4aa	I had some tearing with my first and was happily surprised after the birth of my second that I didn't tear again!!  I think however, that because I had no pain meds with my second, I knew how to push without pushing my body to the point of tearing...I am hoping I can do the same with number three!  To answer your question though - it's possible!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Not necessarily. I had one with my first son. This was before they even asked, they just did it routinely. I had a midwife with all my other labors and never had to have another one. I did not tear or need any stitches with any of them. She did do perineal massage during pushing.  My first one was 7lbs 6 ounces. The second was 8 lbs 6 oz. My third was 6lbs 12 oz and my fourth was 9lbs 4oz ! All natural no pain meds, no epidurals and only with the first one did I have an episiotomy. Something you can try, as long as it is okay with your Dr (bc of your medical history with your scar) Is perineal massage. You can google it and see how to do it. That might help get that area ready for the stretching. Good Luck. I know how you feel. With the episiotomy that I had, I ripped all the way down to my you know what. I did not want to have to go through that again!|`|vr9Nd9Gbaa	You can't ever tell.  It all depends on the baby and really with the doctor's patience.  My first two, I had to have one.  With my third, I had no problem whatsoever and never had to have one.  The doctor was more patient and helped to "work" the baby out.  Also, my sister had one with her first and didn't have one with her other two.|`|eIjMump5aa	I had an episiotomy with  my 1st and 4 years later i tore with my 2nd but it wasn't near the episiotomy scar.<br>  <br>  But saying this with my 3rd (4 yrs after my 2nd) I didn't have anything.<br>  <br>  It made such a difference, i couldn't believe how quickly everything felt normal again.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I had a #1 JERK doctor cut me soooooooo long for the episiotomy that I couldn't sit down for 6 months (had to buy a special doughnut ring).  I had no problems with it EXCEPT FOR THE NASTY SCAR DOWN THERE!  It healed properly.  Our daughter was only 7lbs.  <br>  <br>  Four years later, I conceived our son and he weighted 9" 7 oz and birth him vaginally without any problems.  The episiotomy held!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Your odds are greater yes. It doesn't mean you WILL have another but the chances are much higher. :(
3gkiLN73aa	No.  That would be very stupid for a woman to have a child just for the benefits.   I don't think that the state provides enough benefits for mothers, period, single or not, but even if they did I don't think women would try to be a single parent just because of it.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	YES!! If i would have done it this way i could work hrs hr a day have my daycare payed for and get my nails done Sorry but it is true ,Ppl on this live way better than I do but I look at my self i know I dont depend on tax dollars to suppost me<br>  GOOD QS i am not saying all sinlge gals do this but i have known a lot|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I think that no-one gets pregnant for the money, but they do get pregnant with the knowledge that they won't personally be funding their baby, which really really bugs me.<br>  I have a friend who waited for years and years before trying for a baby because they wanted to be in a great financial position for it - then finally found out she had fertility problems because she waited so long. Why is that fair when I also know a 17 year old who deliberately got pregnant because she was jealous of the baby that her bf had with his ex? She knew she would get benefits, so that makes it ok?<br>  As for the single parent thing - I think it encourages more people to claim single status even if they're not. I know someone who tells them that she's single, even though her partner and the father of her baby lives with them and works - but she gets more benefits this way.<br>  Why do I know all these people? lol|`|plI0WOrUaa	I think women are really independent and capable of supporting themselves and a family these days.  I think its great actually that if a women chooses, she can have a family with or without a spouse if she chooses.  Men will never be left out of the evolutionary process.  Women will always need men's sperm to create new life!  A lot of women still want the traditional marraige and children who follow.  But i think its great that women have other options if they wish.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	there are always going to be those people who want to get over on the state, just because they can. But i don't feel like it is the majority of the women's aim to get state help.|`|x6G2wPjLaa	no it will not encourage women to get pregnant and be single, its not a very nice feeling being on your own bringing up a child without the father around - unless the woman is crazy of course|`|fsHgUrcAaa	Not all single mothers get benefits so I'm gonna say no.
78FXygtoaa	i did!! not purposely though. lol. but i got pregnant only a day or 2 before|`|9ro8fiKvaa	I knew a woman who ovulated DURING HER PEROID!!! YOu never know. If you are breastfeeding the over the counter tests may not pick up your HCG levels so see your Dr for a more sensitive blood test. BTW I was 13 weeks pregnant when I found out for sure - after having taken two home tests (a month apart) that were negative!!!|`|jZQen1pzaa	Hey girl. I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it is soooo possible to get pregnant a few days before your period comes. I am living proof. lol I am 19 weeks pregnant. I concieved halloween night. yay....CONGRATS|`|fTd509Qzaa	it is possible to get pregnant any time with out protection.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I have an Alpha Omega (aka costco aka Eddie Bauer) and an Evenflo Triumph Advance.  I figured the Alpha Omega was pretty good until I got the Evenflo Triumph Advance -its a million times better and generally about 30% cheaper.<br>  <br>  With the Alpha Omega the shoulder straps run in a loop under the baby's butt, which means if you get too much on one shoulder and not enough on the other you basically have to take the baby out of the seat to fix it-and it happens all the time.  You can't reach the harness tightness adjuster on the Alpha Omega with the seat rear-facing as its between the baby's feet and ends up buried in the car's seat.  <br>  <br>  The Evenflo Triumph Advance the harness is easy to loosen and tigthen so you actually get the proper fit each time -you use a knob off to the side (to loosen you have to push this sort of tab on a ring, it works very easily as long as you release the tension first by unbuckling the straps -learned that the hard way).  The shoulder strap has "infinite adjust".  The upside is its easy to adjust, the downside is its easy to adjust.<br>  <br>  The Sunshine Radian 65 is an excellent seat, particularly if you need one that's "portable" (its heavy because its metal but it folds flat) or fit three across (its one of the narrowest seats on the market but has one of the widest "seat space" because its metal.  So it takes up less room but fits larger kids.  Upgrading to the 80 (65 and 80 are the weight limits, is generally not worth it)<br>  <br>  I also hear good things about the Learning Curve "True Fit"|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I recommend the Evenflo Triumph Advance ($139 at toysrus).  It got really good safety ratings and has a higher rear facing weight limit (35 pounds).  It also has the infinite slide seat belt so you don't have to take the seat out to adjust the height of the straps.<br>  I tried a Graco one for my daughter but didn't like it because it looked like she would outgrow it too quick and I had to put rolled up towels underneath it so it was at the right level.|`|rTACLd3Saa	I just bought a great Recaro Como from BJs.com for about a third of the retail price.  (Recaro and Britax are on the same level quality wise and safety wise... and price wise)  I just checked their website and they are out of it now but they also sell a lot of the other popular seats for a lot cheaper than they are at Baby Depot or Babies r Us, etc.  Here is the link.  <a href="http://shop.bjs.com/Car-Seats_stcVVcatId481563VVviewcat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://shop.bjs.com/Car-Seats_stcVVcatId...</a>  I didn't have a BJs card (oh, it's like SAMs or COSTCO in case you don't know) but I used a friends account to order it online.

AA11661793	When I was pregnant with my daughter I was sick the first 20 weeks, constipated so tired I couldn't function. Now I am 16 weeks 5 days pregnant and I have no symptoms whatsoever. I am hoping for a boy, but I will be happy with either!|`|AA10251347	Nope. I had a boy and a girl and it was basically the same each time.|`|POGZZmoUaa	Each pregnancy is different.  It could mean the boy you want but you need to look at what else is different in your life than the first pregnancy.  Are you eating and drinking enough to stay nourished and hydrated?  Of course, you are more tired with a little one to care for.  Are you working outside the home? Consider the differences in your lifestyle from the first to this time and it may give you some clues until you find out the sex.  Good luck!|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|zEK0yY3Eaa	I had a boy first 2.5 years ago and am a month away from having my second boy.

LVZdzPmpaa	The date chosen is the date that a physician will be available and when there is room at the hospital. It is much different in a socialized medicine situation because of all the processing and hubbub that goes on. It's not about his convenience. It's about scheduling. <br>  <br>  There are also considerations regarding the baby, your term, the size of the fetus, etc.<br>  <br>  Certainly you can ask to have the date changed, but your doctor is under no obligation to abide your wishes.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	You can have an elective induction at 39 weeks. So if you are persistent and don't let them sway you then yes you can. It should have been planned a while ago though. That may be hard . Most doctors will only schedule an induction on their day , in other words if he isnt on call when you are 41w3d he won't do it but he may 41w2d or whatever if he is working those days.|`|3hChyHo9aa	deoends how demanding you are my mum chose her dates with her second daughter
0h3qRg79aa	I have a 5 year old son and a 3 and a half year old daughter and I didn't give either of them a "reward" or incentive to use the potty. I did a lot of preparation for the big event. I took them shopping so that they could pick their own "big boy/girl pants" (undies). I then talked to them about the potty explaining that there would be no more nappy's during the day now that they were a "big girl/boy". Then first thing in the morning I would take their night nappy off and put them in their undies. All through out the day I would ask them if they needed to go to the toilet hoping to "catch" them before an accident happened. Sometimes I would just get them to sit there for a while and sure enough something would eventually happen and they would be so excited. The only reward was lots and lots of praise. Naturally it was a challenge when we went out anywhere but once you take the nappy off there is no turning back. Sleep time nappy's only or else they will continue to rely on nappy's. On the days they went to day care I simply told the staff that I was toilet training now and that there were no more nappy's (unless for nap time). I then packed their bags with a pile of undies (I usually got a pile back wet but this eventually stopped). The day care staff were more than capable of following thru with my training.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	sorry but Alexis is stupid... while you CAN potty train a one year old it is considered a young age ot potty train at. 28 months is not old at all and they are not "used to peeing in their diaper."|`|wOLoYW7jaa	Sticker charts have worked wonderful for me - she gets the reward of picking the sticker out of the book, putting it on the chart and watching the 10 boxes fill up - when they are all full she gets a prize out of our prize bag - she really seems to be catching on since we started that!|`|02xxwMRBaa	get her to sit on her own potty by using it as a chair and putting a table in front of her with a coloring book or position her in front of the tv (not too close)  and let her sit and watch a cartoon.<br>  when you hear her tinkling, applaud her and make her feel good about peeing or pooping and then let her wash her hands. but try not to make a big deal about her washing her hands.|`|SWbiblvPaa	She could go at daycare due tot he fact she sees the other kids doing it.  take it easy I am going through the same thing with my 2 1/2 yr. old son. good luck|`|AYLRIMZJaa	You can't give her a reward like cookies.  That is the wrong way to go about it.  She has to understand that the reward is not having a poopy diaper.  Until she views that as a reward, then she isn't going to do it.<br>  <br>  She is only 28 months.  It is not uncommon for girls to go to 30 months.  You just have to put underwear on her and tell her that she can't go in them.  Take her to the potty ever hour, and after she eats, also before and after she wakes up.<br>  <br>  You need to be more firm about this.  You know she can do it because she does it at day care and in her room.  Maybe try letting her go to the bathroom alone, and wait outside till she is done.  Some kids like the privacy.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	Hey ,been there done that, i had one that trained herself before she was 2-too easy.  My now four year old only stopped wearing nappys when she was about 3 -big difference-she had an excuse for everthing-<br>  We got a new puppy and she wanted to help my husband take him for a walk.  My husband had a brain wave and said to her she can't because she is too little and still wears nappys, only big girls can walk puppies.-from that momment on she has worn underpants and has only had 1 accident.|`|pqOnERLWaa	Have patience, she will do it eventually. If she is so conscious of washing her hands, then I'm sure she will want to stop pooping in her pants soon.<br>  I used to let my daughter into the bathroom with my when I needed to go, so she saw that it was a grown up thing to do.<br>  The praise she gets for going on the potty at daycare, might make her feel more important because she is around other children and she can show off to the other kids that she can do it. Plus the carers at daycare have been taught to teach children to go to the toilet, they do it every day!
NxxVk2Zfaa	1. I love Emilee-Kate Rose just because it flows nicely and isn't out there but isn't spelled the original way, making it a little more unique.<br>  <br>  2. I also love Christopher Ryan. It's such a masculine name. It would fit both a little boy and a grown man.<br>  <br>  3. My favorite girl name is Averi Marin (Muh-Rin)<br>  <br>  4. My favorite boy name is Joel Landon<br>  <br>  :)|`|SDzPTYBBaa	1. Do you like the name 'Emilee-Kate Rose' Why/Why not?<br>  --I would like it if you spell Emily normal and if it was the only first name. Having a double first name like that just makes it more difficult on the child when they're older. Stick with Emily Kate Rose.<br>  <br>  2. Do you like the name 'Christopher Ryan' Why/Whynot?<br>  --Yes, Ryan is my favorite boy name, and Christopher is an excellent name, as well.<br>  <br>  3.

'Emilee-Kate Rose' is a bit of a mouthful.  Maybe Emilee / Emily Rose or  Emilee Kate.  They're all lovely names... just not all at once.  (Re Emilee / Emily ; I tend to favour sticking with the more traditional spelling of names; it just makes for less confusion or problems for a child / person through their life.<br>  <br>  2. I do like Christopher Ryan!<br>  <br>  3. Claire Sophie<br>  <br>  4. Alexander James|`|XDftaldzaa	1.)i like Emilee-Kate..Rose kind of makes her name look old..otherwise it is very pretty.<br>  2.)Also like this name..its perfect and thankfully normal compared to these weird celebrity baby names.<br>  3.)Shaniah<br>  4.)Javian (pronounced Jay-vee-in)|`|eIP7y4gNaa	1.

I dont really mind the first name as its quite cute but will be a bit hard for the kid to learn to write when she gets older but it is a nice name.<br>  <br>  2. I like the name, and this is because one of my mates had a similar name and i used to want to be called chris when i was in primary school as i never liked my name.<br>  <br>  3. My favourite girls name is probably hollie but i cant think of a middle name<br>  <br>  4. I like the name Christopher so I dont have another one.|`|VclfMe7uaa	Emily Kate would be a lot better than Emilee-Kate Rose.  I'm not a fan of misspelled names, generally.<br>  <br>  Christopher Ryan is all right with me... it's a sturdy classic.<br>  <br>  My one favorite girl name is Madeleine.<br>  <br>  My one favorite boy name is Ian.|`|Z58Ga3fPaa	1. Kind of.  A middle name with more syllables than Kate would flow nicer, but overall it's a nice name.<br>  2. Yes, it flows really nice.  It just sounds so good.<br>  3. Hayden<br>  4. Gabriel|`|eoidHjwkaa	first name ok emillee rose is better<br>  girls name katlyn <br>  boys jaydon|`|UJaCObdyaa	1 - Emilee-Kate Rose.  I love this name because it reminds me of my daughters name.

wTeJulT5aa	yes, it sounds like a gown.  I LOVED the gowns for my newborn.  They're great!  especially when you need to change their diapers 10 times a day!  If you keep your baby swaddled, he'll be plenty warm.  And, newborns don't move around too much so it should be long enough to stay over his feet.  Put socks on him.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	We can't tell you if your baby is cold- it depends if it's cold in the room... if you think it is, then put some socks on him or a different outfit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  and no need for a thumbs down just because you have no idea whether or not YOUR child is cold in YOUR home... maybe you shuold THINK about it.  I give you thumbs down as a parent!|`|MeYILJeSaa	It sounds like a gown. <br>  It's not an undergarment. How would that even begin to work?<br>  I usually put my son in those for bed. It's nice for when you have to get up in the middle of the night and change a diaper.|`|6AvVVzsnaa	it's a gown. just put in on like you're putting a t-shirt on a baby.|`|pCxM717naa	Its like a unisex nightie/pjs. He would wear a short sleeve bodysuit/vest underneath. Its probably very long and should cover all of his legs and feet, with the elasticated part hanging underneath.<br>  I got these as a gift for my daughter, but she never wore them. Like you said, it was just too cold and draughty. She always wore a sleepsuit and vest at night.x|`|vxoWXVLKaa	Don't worry about being a novice, we all were at one point.  You can put a onesie on under the gown, and some socks too to keep his little toes warm.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	Sounds like a PJ sleeper gown to me.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Yep sounds like Pajamas.. a gown.. <br>  <br>  and no, he would wear that on top of his undergarments..|`|tkSXjqhuaa	It sounds like a sleeper to me.. The bottom is for easy diaper changes during the night, I believe.
dNlCfhD2aa	If your period is still 7 days away you are wasting your time and money.  Wait until the day it is supposed to start.|`|HLKb961Qaa	You really need to be closer to when your period is due, otherwise you probably WILL get a negative, the HCG is just not high enough yet. The tests are designed to detect certain levels, so testing too early will give you inaccurate results. Most tests boast earlier and earlier results, but if you test too early, you'll just be disappointed. Sorry, you'll just have to wait! Good luck!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Early tests only work 5days before your missed period - thats why you are gettting negatives, your testing too early.<br>  <br>  Its hard to wait - but instead of losing hope with each negative, just wait. The longer you wait, the more accurate the result.<br>  <br>  I had symptoms before i missed my period, for about 2-3weeks. Sore breast, nausea, tiredness etc
eabe182e629146523f7d07ea0512f03caa	yes I have been induced. Out of 5 children 2 were induced, 1 was talked about inducing, and the other 2 my water popped. I had all 5 of mine natural with just an iv and very little pain medicine. My biggest baby was 10 pounds and 6 ounces 21 inches long. Everything went fine. Longest in deliver was 12 hours shortest 3 hours.|`|74fa73b730498002fb89db257eb0a03aaa	good luck my daughter had the gel mid afternoon and went into labor that night.|`|IlIjGTdiaa	Induction is scary and can lead to further complications. Have you thought about trying to naturally induce yourself? Here are some ways to help induce labour - sex, acupuncture, go for a walk, drink castor oil. I've attached a website which has info on these and more. Best of luck with your labour, I hope it all works out well!
70Z4DJOcaa	it is difficult to get pregnant... i started trying when i was 19 and me and my fiance didnt fall pregnant until i was 21!! took forever.. i was always scared on of us were infertile or something but we are obviously both ok cause we have a gorgeous 4 month old son YAY be patient darl, i know its emotionally straining but you will get there... all the sex will pay off soon LOL enjoy your pre-pregnancy body while you can!!!|`|3hChyHo9aa	probably higher chance cause his sperm have time to accumulate
52bAHCaUaa	I don't. I have a gallon of water that I use, my daughter likes it room temp though. <br>  <br>  Also, I don't use tap water because I don't trust our water...we don't even drink it!|`|KICQQxLxaa	I never did.  There is no real reason to.<br>  <br>  If your baby will take it room temperature, go for it.  It is alot easier than trying to warm it up everytime.<br>  <br>  My DD would take it room temperature or even cold from the fridge.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	We use warm tap water.|`|GVPhFa3Raa	When i Do My daughters Feeds, cause I use cow and gate.. the HV Told Me To Put 5oz of cold boiled water then add 2oz of boiled water then add the formula.. and shake.. this is just a lil hot so i put it in cold water to cool a tad then test it! i have to do it this way as its a think milk xxx|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I actually never heated my son's bottles.He never minded having water temp. milk.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, DON'T use tap water.Seriously.It is disguting and toxic.Bahting in it is bad enough.|`|6gtgiCS7aa	I'm not a mother yet, but when I baby-sit for my nieces/nephew, I use warm (not hot) water. I test it on the back of my hand to make sure it's not too hot. That's what their mothers and my mother do.|`|aTyNsdApaa	I just use warm water from the tap. Heating the water up can sometime lead to having the water unevenly warmed ( some of it warm and some of it scalding).  My baby never minded if it was warm, cool, or even cold. It will say on the can of most formulas not to heat the water in the microwave or on the stove because it's not always safe.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I wouldn't think that you would have to use bottled water either. But I'm not an expert on that. I was warming up the milk I had expressed and stored. Then I realized that she liked it cold just as much. I really think that it's just how they prefer it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm just curious. Are you saying you bath your child in bottled water? Wow, someone is rich. I don't think there is anything wrong with tap water, unless your out where you have well water, then I understand. And just so you know there have been many documentaries showing how nieve people are b/c most bottling companies just use tap water. Now distilled water is an entirely different thing|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	not nessecarily it depends on what your baby likes mine started out wanting the water heated because it was still cold out when my milk dried up but what i would do is get the tap watter to a perfect temp and fill the bottle that way it was even heat and no boiling needed.... eventually when it got warm out he was perfectly happy with room temperature or cooler milk to help cool him off|`|cen8SIssaa	You dont NEED to heat up the water its just a matter of preference of your child....so anywhere from room temp to warm is perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Cold just will taste horrible and hot will burn them.<br>  <br>  Great luck to you!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	there is no reason that you need to, i think its just preference. we didnt with our first but my s/o started the 'bad habit' with our second and now we cant break it, he has to have it warmed.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Don't use bottled water, just warm tap water<br>  <br>  Edit: you're thumbing down people who use tap water? Seriously?|`|Iod5edCSaa	When our kids were infants we used regular tap water, and never heated it up. Both of our kids would take the bottle right from the fridge.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i dont warm up my sons formula during the day but at night i do a little it helps him get sleepy..|`|lZkQp994aa	I use bottled water for my infant. I heat her water up for 15 seconds before mixing it in with formula. I always think warm milk is better but thats my opinion. Would you drink cold milk? I wouldn't, unless it chocolate milk.
f1e593fccac158ae80c8df2916388085aa	I'd go and explain your situation to your caseworker. They can provide you with the best course of action.  Of course if someone who is claiming you on your insurance refuses to pay, you have to care for yourself and your child somehow.  Ask your caseworker for more information.  Be honest and tell her/him everything.  This way they can map out the best course of action for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- Try and ignore the ignorant comments sweetie.  Don't let them upset you!  You just think about what is best for your baby and just the fact that you are keeping the child at such a young age shows your level of responsibility to me.  God bless you and I wish you well!|`|j083iujcaa	when you fill out the paperwork just add a 1/2 to the address and they will only count your income|`|n3IoftMFaa	So...why is he paying rent if they are divorcing?|`|iiJK4Ivraa	I bet your thinking "I should have bought rubbers" ha ha good luck
y5sWmbtnaa	Yes your baby uses water, but the need for it tapers off (amniotic fluid is tapering off in 3rd trimester)<br>  Its okay to need or feel the need to drink a ton its good for you!|`|AZSIoSNoaa	it will only get worse, you will be in the bathroom every 30 minutes before you know it!!! Extra water along with all the other nutrients going into our bodies is now being split between us and the baby, so it takes more than normal for our bodies to keep up. Good Luck, and God Bless|`|HUrLVofYaa	I don't remember being extra thirsty when I was pregnant on any of my pregnancies, but it's quite possible. Your body does make a lot more blood and fluids when pregnant, probably to cope with the wastes produced by the placenta.
59GymH27aa	1 hour.  You take one right away...say at 9am then one at 9:30 then the last one at 10am.<br>  <br>  So one full hour :)|`|wENdWT5kaa	an hour<br>  <br>  example<br>  <br>  First pill at 300o'clock<br>  Second Pill 330<br>  Third Pill 400 o'clock|`|4vLt3SqFaa	How long does "it" singular last? 30 minutes.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I suppose From the time of the first pill to the last pill it would take one hour. But since you said this is a riddle and riddles aren't usually obvious my guess is that my answer is wrong.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	Depends on when you take the first and if you take them as the doctor orders|`|HkDUxkS4aa	1 1/2 hours?<br>  <br>  Wait when do I start?|`|azE51WGRaa	a few seconds. The question was how long did it last not how long until you take them. It lasted just a few minutes to swallow the pill once every 1/2 hour.|`|Tne3FKRDaa	HALF AN HOUR|`|c0KJxdyjaa	30 minutes|`|Egb1qpB6aa	each one last 30 mins
UYfqzCoMaa	First off congrats on the new sibling!!! Babies are a lot of fun. You could help your mom around the house, hang out with friends. Help your mom get her stuff packed for the hospital if she hasn't done it already. Good luck and I hope everything goes well!!|`|ON84EQaBaa	Congratulation Big Sister! what you can do it give your mom as much help as you can, if the baby is due March 2nd she's pretty tired about now, so just be there in case she need you to rub her back, or her feet, you know something like that, I know you're be a great help for her with the new baby.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My son's birthday is on Monday, hopefully your brother/sister will be on time.

dpKntiZoaa	Ok, I had two in nappies at the same time, my daughter is 13 months now and my son is 2 years old (17 months between them), and now my daughter is reaching the age where she can play easily with my son, so it is a lot of fun for them both.<br>  <br>  It's not a big deal having two in nappies.  The idea is worse than the reality :0), and once you get a routine going with the little on, it becomes fairly easy actually.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a "best" age because it depends what works for you and your family personally.  I am happy to have mine with a small age gap - but for others, it's not the case - so think about what you want personally.<br>  <br>  However, my advice would be not to leave too large an age gap between them.  There is seven years between me and my sister. I was used to being an only child and my mum said that from the start I was not a happy puppy at all, at having a new sibling foisted on me.  We grew up with very little in common (because of the age gap and also personalities) and in later life are not so close either.  Like I said, there is no definate conclusion that this is age and not personality related, but the age gap certainly did not help :0)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision anyway.|`|GVPhFa3Raa	For me.. i would say.. 2years.. so that i know my daughter will be potty trained and know what is going on.<br>  <br>  i want her to understand what a baby is.. and for her to believe that it comes from my belly button or a stalk! Lol Sooo Cute!<br>  <br>  xx|`|y6g0RnuAaa	For us, it would be best to not have two in diapers. I will wait until my son is potty trained. I don't know how parents do it with two babies! I don't think I could!|`|mAJZFmIEaa	I have a four month old and we talked about having another one when she is 2 so by the time the new baby is born she will be potty trained and in a solid routine. Which will make it easier for us, i also want her to be able to understand whats going on and include her in everything so she doesn't feel left out.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i think 2-3 years is good. my brother and i were 2 years apart and we were really close and then we had a younger sister (8 years younger than me and 6 years younger than him) and we could do much with her. my kids are 3 years 3 months apart and its nice that the older one is old enough to help out a little instead of being almost a baby still.
XVljoYZ5aa	I'm 20 weeks and still sleeping on my tummy. Not full on, but my pelvis is to the bed and my belly is facing right a little. I heard it's okay until you're not comfortable anymore. It'll hurt you before it hurts the baby.|`|aHk0xZjYaa	Hey I had the same problem. I was so used to sleeping in my stomach with an arm under my pillow I didn't know what to do. So I asked my Doctor and she said it was completely fine but I'd get to the point where it hurt to sleep on my stomach, so she was right I slept on my tummy until it became uncomfortable then I slept on my side with a body pillow the fit between my legs and I hugged onto it and put my head on the top of it.. kinda like you being the big spoon lol. I also slept in a recliner sometimes.. that was uber comfy too. But there's no harm if you sleep on your stomach...|`|gYFxy8yAaa	Depends on how far along you are. I would buy a body wrap around pillow. That way it will keep your from rolling over onto your stomach!|`|AOCtCePBaa	yes it could hurt tha baby prop some pillows around you so you cant flip on to your belly|`|G4l482d0aa	dont do it! put pillows next to you so you dont roll over|`|mmhuFAYAaa	My Dr. said it limits the baby's blood flow and it's breathing.  Def. ask your Dr.!!  Congrats on baby too!|`|nwHqblWiaa	You will be fine as long as it is comfortable for you. Once you get bigger, it will no longer be comfortable and you'll find another way to sleep! :D|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Once you're too big to lay comfortably on your belly you'll adjust to sleeping on your side - if it's still comfortable for you, then it's comfortable for the baby. :-)|`|c9NuCZnaaa	a lot of "experts" have ummmed and ahhhed about this for years and years. some people will say it can damage you and some say it's fine. I think in my opinion and a lot of other mums on heres opinion is that it's best to just sleep however is comfortable for you. I slept on my belly for as long as it was comfortable for me and my son is nearly one and pefectly healthy. It's a decision completely up to you|`|4lpJRXYsaa	in the first trimester its okay, but after that you needa sleep on your sides. I always slept on my belly but when i found out i was pregnant i was more aware when i would sleep and i like subconsciously made sure i wasnt sleeping on my belly. You know what helps you to keep from doing it is hugging a pillow or putting a pillow in between your legs. Good luck :). Believe me MANY people have this same question you aren't alone :)|`|lg8gqyWVaa	get one of those body pillows for pregnant ladies, i think that will hurt the baby to sleep on your belly, but i don't know i don't have experience. congratulations on baby though!!|`|CKnHMYHnaa	You are probably still early in your pregnancy or else you would not be able to sleep on your stomach.  It gets to be impossible.
SaRDq9iLaa	Hey girl, you're NOT alone!  My husband is a great guy but doesn't help much around the house.  He works all day, comes home and works out.  Then he eats dinner, watches some tv and goes to bed.  I am the one who does all the cooking, cleaning and takes care of the baby (including changing diapers, giving baths, dressing, feeding and playing).  I'm not saying I am ungrateful, but I would like some help once in a while.  I can't do it all, all the time!  I do ask for help and sometimes I get it but a lot of the time I get excuses.  All I can say to you is: I know how you feel!|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	My husband helps out a ton (he always unloads the dishwasher and makes me coffee before he leaves for work).  He also does the bedtime routine with our son on Friday and Sat. nights (he's not home for his bedtime most other nights so this is quality time for them).<br>  <br>   That being said, I also help him alot, he's teaches both highschool and college,  and I help out with grading alot of things, answering his e-mail correspondence, and anything else I am able to do.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	I am in the same boat as you, I stay home with my 4 year old  (since the day she was born) and my husband also has a demanding job.  He usually loads the dishes in the dishwasher for me and takes my daughter to bed to read stories.  Other than that I do everything else there is to do.  I don't expect him to do much else, he works his butt off and is tired when he gets home.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My husband helps a lot when he is at home. I do all the cooking and cleaning, but when he is home he does a lot of things with the baby. On the weekend he changes most of the diapers and gets up with the baby so I can sleep in. But, I'm the only one who does the cooking and cleaning since I stay home all day.|`|EeGgovyCaa	My situation is the opposite from yours. I'm the working parent and my SO is the SAHD. On the weekends, I'm the caretaker. I wake up with the babies, feed, play, get them to nap, clean up...etc.<br>  <br>  All he does on the weekends is sleep and go out with friends. I hate it so much because I work all week, then come home, feed them, bath them and put them to bed. <br>  <br>  Never get to relax. He says me being at work is relaxing, whatever!|`|jrVlzffeaa	Your husband sounds like a saint compared to mine!! lol. I constantly get the excuses and attitude, and I have a go at him for it. I to am old fashioned but a night where he cooks, or does the dishes or even just clears the table would be a dream Xx|`|14JQ11AUaa	My fiance helps out as much as he can, it is hard work! Yea, they are working...sometimes really hard and for extended periods. But they get a lunch break, or time for themselves to shower! We do not, it is hard work. My fiance is a wonderful help and I am glad to have a man like him. Your husband needs to know (which he already does), he is the father. Just because he works during the day does not mean he is exempt from doing things with HIS baby!!!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My husband's main jobs are the bins, the garden and the garage. The garage is his area because his motorbike is in there - it is a disaster. Our garden hasn't seen a pair of clippers in a long time and there's rubbish all over it, and the bins are overflowing because he's forgotton to put them out the last couple of times.<br>  Other than that, he does the odd bits but nothing major. I do think he should do more, but he does work a whole lot of overtime. Although - he does that in order to pay for his motorbike because I refused to allow the payments to come from the family money...<br>  Men. Can't live with 'em, not allowed to shoot 'em.|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	He's pretty good about helping, but I usully have to ask. He doesn't just do it. He also gets an attitude sometimes and it drives me crazy.<br>  <br>  I don't mind keeping the house clean since i'm home during the day, but I did make it clear that I'm not going to go behind him picking up. I'm not his maid! I just remind him that I stay home to take care of our son, not clean a house we both live in and mess up. That usually makes him lose the attitude.|`|P6URKl8xaa	My husband is a big help when he gets home from work or on the weekends.<br>  My daughter is 2, so when he gets home at around 4, he plays with her, then helps cook her dinner & then prepare her for bath time/bed, things like that.<br>  On the weekend, we both help with her.<br>  My other daughter was actually just born today!!<br>  My husband took off today to help with the birth & to watch our older daughter.<br>  <br>  So overall, my husband is a great help around the house =]|`|3RFu4W38aa	As a stay-at-home mom, I don't think there is any problem with the fact that we do most of the housework and cooking. As long as our partners are supporting and helpful when they can be, all is fine. My husband is in the Navy, and so I spend a lot more time at home than him; it's only natural that I do more housework than him. Besides, half the time I worry he'll only do things wrong and I'll have to do them all over again anyway! lol|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	for the first year of my daughters live i did everything feedings baths dressing changeing bed everything and now that shes older he gets upset and his feelings get hurt when she only wants mom, so talk to your husban|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	My husband also has a physical job so usually during the week he just takes out the trash and gives our daughter a bath and playtime. I would rather he spend time with her then clean house. Every once in a while he cooks but only because he wants to. <br>  On the weekends he gets to sleep in one day and I get to sleep in on the other. If there is anything that needs to be done around the house we split it up and one plays while the other cleans. Usually though there isn't a lot of cleaning necessary other than dishes because I try to get everything done in the week. That clears up time to go do things like grocery shop or just get out of the house as a family.|`|i9f0QWMdaa	My hubby has two jobs and three days a week I see him for an hour between jobs and he has only one day off all I ask of him is to change diapers when he's home and help out with little things like not cluttering his work cloths up and tossing his cloths into the laundry room when he gets a chance. other than that i'm a all around everything taking care of my 8 month old son, four dogs two of which are puppies (his soon to be hunting dogs),  two ferrets, and a cat. its a full days work, i'm bushed at the end of the day most days i'm so busy i forget to eat square meals but i'm loosing weight so its ok. i cook clean bake and sew i grew up working in a gold mine so i can handle anything i even fix the truck when he is to tired or busy, yup i'm a Alaskan mom born and bred for hard work.|`|qLkknQx1aa	i'm very lucky.  my hubby helps with everything.  he has more patience than i do so he's quicker to help w/ the kids.  he works 6 days a week. only when he's sick or has to work from home do i take over and do everything without bothering him. - i'm sure your husband is tired from working so much, nothing sucks more than to work all day then come home and not be able to relax, but at the same time, if you decide to have a family you have to sacrifice, and that means you lose sleep, skip meals, skip showers etc etc... i don't think he doesn't care, i think he's probably just really tired. but if he gives you attitude then there is something else that's going on because the attitude is with you, not the baby.  you need to have a little talkie talk with him before you start to resent him and things get worse. - i'm not trying to be negative, sorry if it comes across that way.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	All I ask of my husband is that he brings home a pay check and takes out the trash. I'm very grateful for my ability to stay home with my daughter and even if I was working I'd be the one doing all the housework still.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I feel bad when my hubby does anything during the week because he gets up at 4 AM to go to PT then works from that til 6 or 7 at night (hes in the army.) but if I need help with anything I def. ask.<br>  But on weekends he usually helps a lot.<br>  <br>  If you ask your husband for help though he definetely shouldn't be giving you attitude for it. Yes....he works all day, but being a SAHM is a job too, and if you need help every once in a while with little things he could at least be nice about it if he really doesn't feel up for it.|`|AA10622097	I was a stay at home mommy, I took care of everything at home, my husband was the breadwinner. We had two children, he changed exactly three diapers. He was not involved in raising the children except to provide the paycheck, he felt that was enough. It is different now, I am the breadwinner, he is retired on disability, and he is raising our grandson. He sees what he missed the first time, and is glad to have this chance to be the parent.|`|NH2Yg2x3aa	my husband loves being involved...he thinks of it as a way to bond with our 3 month old daughter since he is in the military and works days and night and he will be deployed for a year soon. Bath time is his time, but mostly he plays with her and wears her out which is great for me. He also watches her when I cook dinner and feeds her whenever I ask. I don't ask him to do too much but he's great at vacuuming and mopping and he knows I hate it. If I ever asked him to make dinner he'd order pizza, so that's out. :-)|`|pXSKSS3daa	He helps out as much as he can. He gets home around 4:30 in the evening and cooks dinner. Then he usually gets Noah cleaned up after dinner(unless I finish first), helps with his bedtime routine, and helps me get his sippy cups ready for the next day.<br>  <br>  I think we work pretty well together. Of course Noah is pretty laid back for the most part so it's not like it's hard work.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My last day of work was today and I'm in school plus 2 children.<br>  I am due in 2 1/2 months with #3.<br>  My husband is in the air force and even though he works many hours he takes care of the kids when I go to class 2 nights a week.<br>  On the weekends he helps me with laundry, cooking, cleaning and anything else I ask.<br>  He is such a wonderful man.
E2e485WRaa	Go into the doctor or to the hospital a million times if you need to.  Do not feel bad about this.  You are trying to protect your baby and that is what the doctor/hospital is there for.  It is much better to be safe then sorry.  <br>  <br>  Here are a few things you need to do to help the situation:<br>  -stay off of your feet<br>  -lay on your left side as much as possible<br>  -drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  In other words, put yourself on bed rest.  It is the best thing you can do for your baby and for your sanity.  Laying on your left side, staying off of your feet and drinking all that water should help reduce the tightening.  <br>  <br>  You need to try and relax.  Stress makes tightening and contractions worse.  <br>  <br>  The other thing you can do is monitor the baby's movements.  Do two kick counts a day.  One in the morning and one at night.  Count how many times your baby moves- any type of movement (hiccups don't count).  You should get a minimum of 10 movements in 2 hours.  If you feel your baby move frequently, then you do not need to do this.  If you happen to notice that she isn't moving (something's difference) then start the kick count.  If you do not get the 10 movements in 2 hours, go to the hospital ASAP.  Like I said it is much better to be safe then sorry and that is what they are there for.  <br>  <br>  You can always get a stethoscope or a fetal doppler (you can rent them) to check the baby's heart beat.  So you can be assured she is alive and well.  <br>  <br>  I understand what you are going through.  It is so hard to worry about your baby - especially after you have had a complication.  I had a placental abruption at 25 weeks.  I am now 29 weeks and still on bed rest.  I also had the steroid shots for lung development.  I go in once a week for monitoring - ultrasound, NST (fetal heartbeat, movement & contractions) as well as some internal exams to check my cervix.  My OBGYN, my perinatalologist and all the nurses remind me each week to call and come in if I have any blood, strong contractions, strong pain or decreased fetal movement or an overall feeling that something is wrong that just won't go away.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best and a very healthy baby.  Hang in there.|`|eabe182e629146523f7d07ea0512f03caa	just drink plenty of fluids, eat, get some rest, relax. I felt off when I had my last baby girl and everything was just fine. My doctor told me everything would be just fine. She here and 7 months old and double her weight already. You might be over worrying and that might be where this is coming from. You're going to be more sensitive.  I hope this helps.|`|RDUif0mbaa	only you know your body, if you feel like something is off, i would ask for an ultrasound. also, your hormones are wacko, so maybe some of the feelings you are getting are from them. but i would definately ask for the ultrasound.|`|bxBi1Z8Eaa	You have your answer, but it appears you don't want to hear it. Everything is fine, your baby is fine. In the bedroom next to me as I type this is a pregnant woman due in two weeks, and almost everything you have listed she complains about as well. <br>  <br>  Stabbing pains in the vagina? Check<br>  Really hot? Check<br>  Really sensitive when normally not? Oh heck yes check<br>  <br>  Your baby is fine, you are understandably nervous and your body is a train wreck because of all it is going through right now. It will all be good. <br>  <br>  Congrats on the impending birth of your child!|`|cNuRToGFaa	it is normal i had it bad with my daughter and it gets worse as you get more along i know sometimes i was tears with how uncomfortable it was but i was told it was the baby getting her head into the right position ya you do wish they would hurry Little tip try getting one of the big yoga balls and sitting on it and just rolling your hips around try it with legs open and then legs closed this should help i know it did me and in labour lol|`|ksWm9eCBaa	If I'm not mistaken, you posted several minutes ago, too..so I know you're stressed....plus...if you are in the US...no matter what time zone we BOTH should be sleeping---especially you!  <br>  <br>  Reading between the lines, I think you get concerns and your OB seems to not be the most patient doc on the block?  Well, darnit, this is what we pay 'em the big bucks for!  You are going to be a Mommy---you have MommyKnowledge and were right at 29 weeks...the stabbing pains in the vaginal area would greatly concern me too!  BUT, are you having anything else?  You've had these pains, but perhaps they're worse since she dropped?  (that happened to me, too---it felt just like someone had an ice pick playing around down there!! Turned out to be nothing to worry a/b and finally went away!)  Maybe there is just a strange new pressure caused by her dropping---like sitting on nerves that were heretofore untouched...or the pelvic floor shifting, getting read for her birth.  Think you could read yourself to sleep, just for tonight?  I'm a bit more than sure that your body "not letting you sleep" is that you're stressed to the max...the heat can be stress too?  Tune in to the most boring movie you can find...and try your best to get a bit of sleep tonight.  Call that doc in the morning with a cool, calm FIRM request for an appt!  You're not chopped liver....this is one time in your life you have every right to demand to be an All About Me Show...until your daughter steals the limelight, that is!  Good luck and NiNight!!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	u know your body better than anyone- so you should listen to that!  the hospital wont do anything for you until you are well into labor, and if all of the necessary precautions have been taken already with the steroids then they must think it is viable to let labor continue.  <br>  Only time will tell if you are right or wrong- but go up to the hospital if you cant stop thinking about it, and get them to check you out and demand to know what is going on.  <br>  You could be getting ready for labor- i know i felt off for about a week before i had my daughter. I was so cranky- then so sad and crying lol- no doctor could say anything to me that i would take well- and no one else could either!!<br>  i dont know if other women had those signs coming up to labor or not....<br>  A mothers intuition is generally right- but we do jump the gun a bit sometimes lol! best of luck to you and your little one|`|KPmfrevlaa	im a strong believer in 'mother's intuition/instinct', i KNEW there was something wrong with my 19month old daughter but everyone even her father and 2 doctors told me nothing was wrong, so i took her to a third doctor (after 3 weeks) turns out she has whooping cough. i feel so bad for leaving it so long, but it could have been so much worse! she could have died! <br>  if you feel there is something wrong DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU OTHER WISE! dont leave the hospital until they can prove to you everything is fine.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	When I was 19 weeks pregnant with my first (deceased) I felt this way. I went to the doctor and they had trouble finding her heartbeat. I ended up having an emergency ultrasound and finding out she had heart defects and a tumor. I AM NOT SAYING ANYTHING IS WRONG WITH YOUR BABY! I just want to you to know that we have these feelings for a reason and maybe you should call your doctor and go to the hospital/triage.|`|AA11354548	hormones, yes and mothers intuition, a mommy always knows<br>  when somethings up, I believe that its just because its almost there<br>  the time to give birth . <br>  Maybe go to the doctors again, ?<br>  do they know about all of these pains ?<br>  <br>  I know its very frustrating. I'm sorry.<br>  Feel better, and congrats !<br>  <br>  boy or girl ?|`|br0gCYDBaa	You are not alone. Lots of us have this happen. First just know you have every right to feel worried and upset.You are having a girl so considering you took roids for her and pills to stop labor, her lung development should be well enough along if you do have her.I had the same feeling you are having and I was right. Doctors can only see what technology allows. Because she dropped down you will have sharp stabbing pains and tightening. She may come soon.But this does not mean you are in labor women in normal pregnacies have these pains in last few weeks of pregnacy.If this doesn't help go to the e.r. or back to your doctor. Insist they check everything again !!!Don't take no for an answer do what you need to make it through. Keep in mind it could be frazzled nerves due to a difficult pregnacy.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I gt sharp pains down there too which I never really worry about. But a nurse advised me to go to get it checked because it was also hard to walk from it being so tense and sore too. I was told it's the pubic bones moving apart which not all women experience. I was checked for dialating and wasn't. And I felt nothing was wrong... I mean with my little girl but something wasn't right with me though. So I have to not walk as much to keep the pain levels down.I nhope you feel better.
azE51WGRaa	Some of these are signs of preterm...just be prepared that they will give you terabutaline again to stop it...Your baby's lungs aren't developed enough for it to survive without medical attention meaning that you will go home and your baby will have to stay if you have it now. Call the dr. and see what they say. Some of the abdomen pains can be caused by the ligaments in you legs and vagina loosening up in preparation of birth. You could also get stabbing sensations in your abdomen and legs from sciatica, which is caused by the baby laying and putting pressure on the sciatic nerve in your back. Hope this helps some.|`|ryvG0TXEaa	call your dr. or midwife. when it comes to your pregnancy you can never be to careful.|`|nSva5cblaa	how much water , seems ur going through labor go to the er asap if not ur prego so its importnt to go to the er even if its nothing|`|8b312325be01e2ee18a694dc156bcc3daa	CALL YOUR DE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A DR GO TO ER OR IF A CL INC IS OPEN TRY THEM FR IST.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	The best advice I've gotten for pregnancy was...

WPI0Z47saa	I am a stay at home mom and my husbabnd and I had that arguement when our first son was born. That was until he had to watch him for a whole day and I asked him why he didn't get anything done and no dinner or anything. He said "how could I when I had to take care of the baby all day". From that point on he realized how much work goes into taking care of kids and a household at the same time and that it was't "easy" like he had thought. We never had that fight again.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I agree with you. I think that while your husband is at work, you should be taking care of the kids, and obviously you are going to do a little more housework than him simply because you are home.  Such as starting dinner etc.  However, once your husband gets home,  he needs to be helping you out.  His job at work is done, but the job at home is never done.  He should be sharing the duties in the evenings and on the weekends.  I cook dinner, my husband cleans the kitchen and I tidy up the rest of the house.  We both gives the kids baths and put them to bed.  We take turns getting up early on the weekends, and we divide all the chores on the weekends between us. You are not asking too much, and unless you want to pretend it's 1950, you should have a talk with him.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I'd respectfully suggest that if you work 24 hours a day all year, do all the errands, all the cleaning, all the cooking, and all the nighttime interventions, and your husband takes weekends and evenings completely off, then it's way past time to be having this conversation with him rather than the internet audience.  <br>  <br>  sounds like a depressing relationship.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I can't imagine what could possibly keep you busy at home for 8-10 hours a day.  I work full-time though and have never been a stay-at-home mom, but even on the weekends i know i'm not cooking and cleaning the whole time.<br>  <br>  It does sound like you have a 50/50 relationship.  He works his job and you work yours.  If you don't like the arrangement, why don't you ask your husband to be a stay-at-home dad and you go back to work full-time?|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	I hear you! My husband works all day, sitting behind a desk, WITH OTHER ADULTS, and gets to actually eat lunch. I'm at running around like a mad women, cleaning, cooking, and chasing after the kids. Not saying I don't love my job, but it's just as hectic, if not more, than my husband's job. <br>  <br>  After I heard it from my husband enough, I made an outline of my day compared to his. He got the message loud and clear, no yelling involved.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i told mt dad once ( he is a real pig) boy you men sure have it easy .he looked at me shocked men really dont get it . never will my nice guy hubby still comes home after a hard days works and gets king treatment. he might do the dishes once a week maybe|`|AA11210211	lol Calm down hun,I think every SAHM has felt this way at one point or another,Sit down with your hubby and tell him how you feel.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	That sounds pretty 50/50 to me... Does he help you AT ALL around the house? Maybe you could ask him to help out on the weekends. I believe that even spouses who work full time outside the home should have *some* household responsibilities, like cleaning up after themselves, if the other is a stay at home parent.|`|e802de1531bba8087cb150cd1a050d61aa	It should be but most men don't see it this way!<br>  I work outta the home mon-fri 8-4:30<br>  get home make dinner do baths clean house get kids to bed make sure homework is done. and still gotta give it up!<br>  so yeah um we are way too under appreciated!!!!|`|8oAlBL91aa	If your going to complain so much then why don't you get a job and leave him to the house work. Seriously at least he is bringing in some money to support you guys give him a break.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	most men think they can do it. you leave him with the kids go out see a movie get ur nails down come home and he will be bowing down and saying how your so great for putting up with that|`|vhYBqEFiaa	i think you have a 50/50 relationship.  i've done both, i stayed home with my kids for a long time, but now my husband is the stay at home parent.  honestly, i think he's better at it than i was!  not only does he take care of the housework more efficiently, he tinkers and has more hobbies (which he often shares with the kids).  <br>  <br>  getting a job of your own is only one suggestion, i think you'd miss being at home though.  i would suggest something part time, join a gym, or go to college part time (the government loves to give grants to mothers).  it gives you back your sense of self, which is something we mothers have tendency of being robbed of  :)  We have to love ourselves, as well as our families!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
fniHoVyaaa	Use a electrical melter, the smoke from the candle may bother the baby. Oh and make sure that the candle is out of reach of your baby, but I am sure you already knew that =)|`|8oAlBL91aa	You know I really don't know when your supposed to be able to start that back up again.

There was a scare years ago because some companies put lead in the wick.  This is now illegal and unless you have candles that are over 5 years old, this shouldn't be a problem.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	as long as the candles are out of reach of the child i don't see a problem i burn candles and my daughter has never shown any negative signs from them|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I've been a candle burner for the whole 15 years I've been a parent and my kids are fine;-)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i use an electric melter.  not sure if thats what they are called.  i feel safer using that with my kids.  they are older and can grab and pull and climb.  at 3 mos she can't do those things.  as she gets older you might want to look into one of those, at least for your sanity's sake if it makes you nervous.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit - my disclaimer - my house burnt down when i was like 7 or so.  im a little paranoid.  i forget not everyone else is.

OQnRP6xVaa	Yes, typically the state you live in will ask you to review and consider all of the children in your own state first--and then after a period of time usually 6 months to a year if your family is still waiting for a Match allow a more wide search to take place.<br>  <br>  Yes, if it is a relative in foster care in another state.<br>  <br>  There is more paperwork and agreements to be made between the states called an ICPC which adds time on the process. <br>  <br>  Oregon is know as a great state to adopt From and takes great care in finding the right match for the Children in the state regardless of where they will be placed. Oregon has great expereince with the ICPC issues and is known to have one of the lowest rates for disruptions/disoultions of the adoptions of foster children from their state.<br>  <br>  If you should happen to stumble onto a photolisting of a child In Oregon Do Not Contact the childs worker directly as they will Not speak to interested parents Until they have reviewed the home study and spoken to the interested parents case worker.<br>  ***ETA--I answered fast so I could cook dinner but wanted to add because my answer was a little unclear:<br>  <br>  It's hard to answer your Q without a little more info: Often out of state placements happen if you are a relative of a child in a foster home in another state. <br>  Sometimes it's possible to adopt "specific" children in foster care in another state if you are related or the children have formed a connection with you.<br>  No matter what however, YOUR end of things is handled by Your state. So, any child you would adopt from Foster Care would require you to work with your own state and county office. <br>  Any child placed with you from any state FC will include a period of time from placement to adoption where Your local DHS would be required to provide post placement supervision until the adoption is finale and children leaving FC will continue to be covered under Medicaid or State Health insurance until 18 or 21. That is where the ICPC paperwork is required.<br>  <br>  If you are in the early stages of the process you might be looking at internet lisings of children in your own state and think there are Not very many free for adoption. That's the problem with internet listings because it makes it appear there are very few children to even adopt. <br>  The fact is, that sadly when any child is listed publicly on the Internet it is really the last resort to find a family for the child. These children are nearly always those who are Wards of the state meaning the whole process has been completed and they have No Person with parental rights.<br>  Many states do what they can to avoid the last few steps to terminate parental rights UNTIL they have found adoptive placements for them. Meaning they look high and low for families and once found they complete the process. It is not good for all of these children in the system to have the State as their only parents. They get lost when there are too many.<br>  So, families who take the steps to become approved for Adoption will be given Information about children who are one step away from being legally free. <br>  In our state at the time we found only 12 or 13 children listed publically on the internet. When we were approved we CRIED because we were given access to the binders filled with page after page of children one step away. There were at least 500.<br>  They do not publicize these children because they technically still have parents and due to confiendiality No One knows about them except the State, caseworkes and approved families. <br>  It is easy to think there are not many children if you only have access to those publicized. If this is the root of this question know that for every child you do see there are 100 more no one knows about unless they are approved to be considered as a family for them.<br>  Don't let the LACK of children you see from your state publicized cause you to believe there are Not very many to consider in your state. It doesn't work that way.<br>  *|`|LBfD7tbHaa	Yes you can...|`|ioF7tCGMaa	Yes you are able to adopt from out of state. It is a slightly longer process at times because of ICPC review but not too long. Both of our children are from different states. One we found on adoptuskids the other we were chosen by a task force on hard to place children in the state we adopted from.

ksWm9eCBaa	I did something very rare for me one night:  got absolutely knee-walking drunk.  So drunk, I left my purse at the club (done that twice in my life: 1) First & 2)Last time that night!)  Weeks later I found out I was pregnant and was TERRIFIED I'd simply floated my baby in bourbon!   My doc was not really happy with me (it WUZ a stoopid thing to do regardless!), but assured me that all things are relative: I was so newly pregnant, that relatively speaking, very little alcohol went thru my system to the baby.  Rest assured:  not one sip of ANY 'adult beverage' passed my lips after i found out!  I ate/slept/exercised in HealthBaby Mode till I delivered. I did not take ANY meds (even OTC) unless approved by doc...but Tylenol was one he always approved.<br>  <br>  Epilogue:  a baby so cute, that folks standing outside the nursery were heard to say, "Ooooo...lookit THAT one...isn't he beautiful?" and he later tested 141 on IQ.  Quit worrying and just take extra good care of a couple of special people these next few months:  You and Your Baby!!!|`|UqDIhxcdaa	Most likely not, there are a few disorders, disases, syndromes that are alcohol related. Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) includes a range of features seen in some babies who were exposed to alcohol before birth. <br>  <br>  Two other terms – foetal alcohol effects (FAE) and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) – refer to effects on a baby who has some but not all of these features.<br>  At birth, FAS signs can include: <br>  <br>  Low birth weight <br>  Smaller than normal head circumference (microcephaly) <br>  Small eyes <br>  Flattened face <br>  Flattened bridge of the nose <br>  Underdeveloped vertical ridges that run from the nose to the upper lip (philtrum) <br>  Thinner than normal upper lip <br>  Small lower jaw (micrognathia) <br>  Heart defects <br>  Tightening of muscle, tendons, ligaments or skin restricting movement of elbows or knees (joint contractures).<br>  Anything you eat or drink eventually crosses into the babies blood but considering you drank very little it's most likely fine. FAS is most common in indeigenous communities where they get pissed all the time so I wouldn't worry. But talk to your doctor if you are concerned.|`|eL268hETaa	As far as I know, alcohol during pregnancy does not cause deformity.  But it can be related to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a type of retardation.  If all you had was ONE DRINK, I think you have nothing to worry about.  F.A.S. risk increases as the amount you drink increases.<br>  <br>  I haven't been pregnant since 1990, but Tylenol was one of the things my doctor said was safe back then.  I know it's easy to get worried during pregnancy, but please keep in mind that it has been proven that a baby's temperament is directly linked to the mother's emotional state during pregnancy.  If you spend all your time worried, stressed out and upset, then you WILL have a fretty fussy baby who is difficult to calm.  Just relax... You will be having an opportunity soon to take a test at 20 weeks or so to check for birth defects.  It's called AFP.. for alpha fetal protein.  Even THAT is no guarantee since the results aren't 100% foolproof, but it should make you feel a bit better by then.  Just calm down and think good thoughts... nice calming peaceful thoughts... and get some rest.  And don't count your chickens before they hatch... {pun intended!}  ;-)|`|T9fek24eaa	You would have been about 2-3 weeks pregnant at the time you drank, so I would say no, probably not. There is always a chance, but it is such a slim chance because that was the time the egg was actually getting fertilized, development was not at the prime. Then as far as tylenol goes... tylenol is completely SAFE during pregnancy so you are ok with that. <br>  <br>  With my first daughter I drank the night before I found out I was pregnant and I had the same worries and I completely flipped. She is now 3 years old and healthy as can be. Calm down, you should be having a level 2 scan with in the next couple of weeks to look at all of the organs and take measurements and such. I am sure everything will be ok.

lJ5Ao2aIaa	Don't worry about it, they r all the same.. It does get BETTER! The turning point would begin when he could play with his hands, so you can give him a toy to play with. <br>  <br>  Some things you may do that help: <br>  <br>  *ONLY go places right AFTER he is fed.<br>  <br>  Try different kinds of music or try singing or making noises!|`|l0YvaYTDaa	My son does the same thing...he's almost 6 mos.  I pray that I don't get stuck at a long light.  A pacifier helps.  Sometimes I will take my foot on and off the brake so the car moves slightly while stopped.  You can give him a toy or dangle a toy to play with from his carseat etc. to give him something to look at.|`|mqvxIgRdaa	play music in the car my Son's 4 months and has done that also.I have in the last few week played music and he seems to start to cry but soon as he starts he hears the music and falls asleep again. try to play the same few songs so he get familiar with them good luck mom!!|`|PnPVoakoaa	he's already got you under his thumb.<br>  <br>  As long as you cater to him like that, he'll always respond the same way.  YOU as a parent need to take control.  Introduce him to a rocking chair or purchase a baby swing for him.  It's cheaper than wasting gas money and wear and tear on your car.  Plus, when you're in the car, there is more risk of being in an accident!|`|Kl0ZxAW2aa	We have exactly the same problem. Try to shake his car seat as if it's moving. It worked for me...

Occasionally singing or talking works but most of the time...not so much. <br>  <br>  I would just try to take routes that have the least stops/lights/traffic and avoid congested areas during peak travel times if possible.|`|33h5R8nTaa	my daughter does this when she is over tired...I stop a rediculous amount of space behind the car infront of me and i guess you could say "rock" my truck by letting go and hitting the breaks kinda like when u dont relize ur moving and u slam ur breaks or just keep moving at slow rate.|`|qayCggxMaa	My kids both did that when they were very little too.  He will outgrow it before too long.  Singing to them frequently helped.  Otherwise, just try to avoid as many stop lights as possible.

ibWLdXlJaa	Lol get used to it, it's normal. My son started drooling between 3-4 months. He is now 9 months with no teeth to mention. He's able to put his hand in his mouth so he's going to do it. It's mostly a self soothing thing. Don't worry. :)|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Both normal, his salivary glands started working and he is using his hand as a pacifier.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	It'stotally normal. Your babies mouth is getting ready to begin the teething process. My girl was about the same age when she starting drooling nonstop and discovered her hand. I think it's sorta cute when they suck on their hand. My little girl (who will be 5 months in a few days) is a total handeater! :)|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Most babies do that - they can't control their saliva, and they explore with their mouths.<br>  My MIL shouts 'teething' every time my 4 month old does it - or my 4 month old niece.

All babies drool|`|8fiIbUHjaa	It's perfectly normal for a baby to do that no worries. I was worried at 1st since I'm a 1st time parent but it sounds like he's exploring his/her mouth as funny as that sounds lol. My son is only 9 months and now he's putting 1 finger in his ear for some reason lol looks so cute but It's just a phase that baby's go through so you have nothing to worry about. It can't be teething because It's way to early for the baby's teeth to come in.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	The vast majority of babies sprout their first teeth when they're between 4 and 7 months of age. An early developer may get his first white cap as early as 3 months. <br>  <br>  You will know if your baby started teething by noticing these symptoms:<br>  <br>  ? Drooling (which can lead to a facial rash)<br>  ? Gum swelling and sensitivity<br>  ? Irritability or fussiness<br>  ? Biting behavior<br>  ? Refusing food<br>  ? Sleep problems|`|qfuhHeDjaa	sounds like teething...

53c98641fa37351a0f3c0769f6fd7ddbaa	noo..there is no way to find that out unless the woman tells herself
XM41P9Tbaa	I Do Not think that abortions are ok in any situation. especially the one you just described. Your sister and her boyfriend played around and well they do make stuff out there to prevent to get pregnant. And how could your sister be that way I am not trying to mean or rude but that is a living life inside of her. And just because she screwed you does not mean she should take it out on an Innocent life. And yes that baby has a heart and it lives and breaths. She and her boyfriend do not need to play GOD and take someone else freedom away. Children are a blessing and well just tell her look at it this fine you don't want your career messed that is fine. Let me adopt the baby and go on with your life. There is no point in taking someones life when there is much more to offer it here. And it will be loved and cared for and the baby does not even have to be in your life and you wont have to take care of it. It will be me. Try something along those lines and maybe that will help. I do hope and pray to GOD that she decides to do the right thing and go ahead and have the baby and let you adopt the baby. You are in my prayers.|`|TmuLhZtyaa	its her choose but maybe tell her if for good|`|Xw4c2VQEaa	tell ur stupid sister to not have unprotected sex and she wouldnt be in this mess|`|UqDIhxcdaa	Abortions are never ok unless your sister will die if she waits nine months like bad cancer or something but if the only reason is because the baby is unwanted then that is not a good reason. If you get some info on the methods and what happens to the baby during and after or show her some pics she will either feel sick or have a second thought about your offer. Everyone says its a womans choice but in my opinion if you can't handle the choice of closing your legs then who are you to choose life or death of another person?<br>  There is a website called operation save america which is pro-life and there is plenty of info you could tell her. How many weeks is she?<br>  Who are we to judge? Isn't the question who is she to be able to take an innocent life? some states still allow the death penalty but others won't let axe murderers be killed but little babies are allowed to have there bodies ripped apart by a vacum or there skulls inpaled?!|`|ryvG0TXEaa	well... its her body so no there is nothing you can do to convince her to give her baby to you. 9 months of pregnancy isn't for everyone. As far as abortions go I am pro choice. However it becomes disgusting when people abuse it. I had a friend that did and still does and its very disturbing. If it really could mess with her career then having a kid probably isn't the best idea. However if she doesn't want a kid she should be more careful next time. I had an abortion when I was pregnant and too young to take care of a child. If she feels it is not the right time then she shouldn't have it b/c she will end up resenting the child like i have seen happen so many times before.|`|giKCTfnfaa	wow.  <br>  <br>  i personally don't think abortion is right in any situation. it's not a form of birth control.   there are many people who would love to adopt a baby. my aunt and uncle were on a waiting list for 8 years and finally gave up.  however, how i feel, how you feel, or how the poster 3 down from me feels doesn't mean everyone has to feel the same way.  <br>  <br>  have a heart to heart with just you and your sister.  explain to her you would really like to adopt the baby and raise it.  if she has the abortion, she doesn't know if she's taking the life of the person who can find the cure for cancer..or any other person of greatness.  there's no reason to end a life because it's basically a nuisance in hers.|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	I think abortions are OK in any circumstance.  Age, financial status etc should not be used against people.  If someone genuinely does not want/feel ready to be a parent then this wish should be respected.  Who are we to judge?|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Your sister is a wally, if she's 29 weeks she's 3/4 of the way through anyway, she should just have the baby and let you adopt in my opinion.<br>  I don't think abortions are ok for convenience, I think that's an irresponsible way to look at it and very wrong. <br>  <br>  But really... Is there anyone out there that will perform an abortion that late in a pregnancy anyway? I thought it was illegal after the first trimester unless it's for medical reasons.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	No out of convenience is not ok..... In fact it would have been more convenient if your sister had chosen to not have sex if her life was to busy to handle the natural consequences.  you stepped up at 14 and handled it... mom with a full time jobs do it all the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  all that said the only one who has the choice is your sister  not the baby and not you.. so you can hope/pray she realizes the gift she has been given..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  for me no circumstances would cause me to choose abortion..|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I dont think they ok ever & this is why:<br>  <br>  For every aborted baby, there is a couple (or single person) who dreamed of having them, there are thousands of men and women who cry themselves to sleep because they cannot get pregnant. They would love any child they could ever be blessed with.<br>  <br>  And I truly believe that god gives us blessing such as these for a reason.|`|AA10153923	I personally do not believe in them in any circumstance.|`|T9fek24eaa	I am pro-choice, but there has never been a time that I have heard about a woman using abortion as a birth control method that I have been that crazy about. I can't say that I am crazy about ANY abortions actually, but I do believe it is a womans choice. I would much rather see any woman be on birth control than to see or hear about an abortion period, but it is not my right to tell a woman what she should do. I never wore the crown of thorns to be able to pass judgment either.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	My opinion, they are not okay in any reason, if GOD didn't want her to conceive, she wouldn't have. I can't believe she would be so selfish to want to kill it because the dumb dad don't want it and its a bad time for her, so many people out there can't conceive. I hope she don't go through with it. Good luck to you, and keep trying to talk her into just giving it up for adoption.|`|3hChyHo9aa	i dont ever think they are ok personally MY OWN OPINION PPLZ im sure u could convince your sister its ur sis cant be that hard my sisters daughter is 10mnths n i think if i said to her i want her she'd give her 2 me, but u know she doesnt want to ruin that 29y/o body of hers make her feel guitly thats what sisters are for lol all the best|`|VQORLGaGaa	I personally ony believe there is ONE situation where an abortion is acceptable. and that's when the pregnant person got raped, and they cannot financially support themselves through the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  But that's just my opinion.|`|3IimJWgXaa	wow your so brave sister. hats off to you... clap clap clap....<br>  <br>  i wish i could say i wouldnt f it came to it.... but, i think i MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE would. i highly doubt it. I just think.. ok.. this happened for a reason... why am i stopping life?!!? ya kno? If i kill this child im not "living" and let life live either.... wow. powerful huh..?... <br>  <br>  im so sorry for this state that ur stuck in.<br>  my prayers and good energy go out to u and ur daughter, sister and her unborn child.<br>  <br>  xxpeacexx|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Your sister's case is acceptable and I can understand her not wanting to go through 9 months of pregnancy so you can adopt her baby.|`|LDiBjNf5aa	Although you may think that adopting her child is what's morally best, can you imagine how incredibly difficult it would be for her to see her daughter at all family get togethers, while knowing that she would never truly be her mom? It's dangling what she can't have right in front of her. Because if she knows that she can't handle being a mother right now, she knows better than anyone. To ask her to give you her baby is selfish, in my opinion, if you were truly just against the abortion part of it you would encourage adoption outside of the family - not to you.<br>  <br>  Even if you think this is an easy decision for her, it's not. She is well aware of the burden it carries, and yet she still has decided it's the best course. All you can do is support her and be her sister.|`|XVXOLkYoaa	The only time I would ever condone an abortion is in an extreme situation...<br>  A medically necessary abortion to sustain the mothers life or<br>  A case of incest or rape where a woman is forced and becomes pregnant<br>  Out of convenience No. I think it is selfish, irresponsible, cruel, and disgusting. What right does any of us have to say that we are too busy or just dont want to take care of a life that we obviously had the time to lay down and make....<br>  If she does go thru with it and she is not totally self absorbed it will affect her. And one day she is going to look back and wish that she had done it differently. I was raped at 14 by a stranger and became pregnant. My father is Catholic so he was against abortion but my mother was adamant that it would traumatize me to have this baby.<br>  It is 16yrs later and I think about how different things would be but always wonder if it was right. The baby didn't do anything wrong. But I imagine it is horrible to tell your child how they were conceived if that happens so ....I dunno.<br>  Anyway, the other thing I always think about women having abortions out of convenience is ...what will they do if 6mths later they develop a problem (unrelated) and they undergo an emergency hysterectomy? Then it will be..."If I had kept the baby I would have my own kids". Life is unpredictable....she should think hard about it, do not do it for her man and consider other alternatives...
XidE1P5Faa	This is so sad. It seems that ur mom is broken hearted over the fact that u chose ur own which way to go and not her way. No child or grandchild deserves this kind of treatment. I say stay away from her for a while, long enough for her to start missing u and ur daughter. Sum people dint realize what they've got til its gone. Or on a serious note, maybe u should suggest counseling. That's if your mom is willing to consider. How dare your mom criticize u constantly for bringing life into this world. That's the most precious gift, becoming a grandparent. She should be enjoying it not bashing u and your daughter. Good luck to u and my heart goes out to u.|`|nSva5cblaa	ur child comes firs so tell her if she doesnt stop to stop visiting you tell her u love her but as much as she wants the best fo u ,u want the best for ur daughter,<br>     mother of a 9 mom babgirl|`|79LdWKogaa	Avoid her. It is not healthy for you or your daughter.You made a decision she did not like and I guess she is probably bitter about it.Dont invite her over dont go visit avoid her at family gatherings and let her know if she contiues to be direspectfull to you and your child you are not going to be a part of her life anymore. If she can learn to respect you,your daughter and the choices you have made.Then let her back into your life. Good luck hope things work out for you and your daughter.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	If it were me this would be one situation were I would consider having no contact with my mother. A parents job is to protect their child and your mother is emotionally abusing your child. I would tell my mother flat out that if she didn't stop this behavior I would not allow her to be a part of my life anymore. She needs to accept that this is your life and nothing anyone does or says now will change what happened 15 years ago. It is shameful that she cannot love your daughter and blames everything bad on her.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Why have you allowed this for so long?<br>  <br>  You should have told her a long time ago that if she can't be respectful she can't be around you or your daughter until she can. If she comes to visit, send her home, don't take your daughter to visit her.. and stop allowing  your mom to abuse your child the way she has been for so long!<br>  <br>  You are her mother, it's your job to protect your daughter. So let mom know that her behavior will change or she will not be welcome in  your home anymore. Get a back bone lady and stand up for you and your child!|`|BwIBMDfLaa	if she seems upset, explain that you love her and she didn't mess up anything she made it better.  <br>  <br>  i would simply not let your mother near her.  you should never say that sort of thing especially in front of the child.  she is already upset and telling her that it would be better if she didn't exist is just wrong.  tell her that your mother is wrong and she was a miracle and a blessing not a bad thing.|`|7imMv3Niaa	her own medicine.<br>  talk about what a b*stard she is to your daughter and how you wish she would stop coming to your door just to spread grief. be truthful in every aspect even her good points but amp it up. the only person you can say this to without spreading gossip is your daughter with her in on it. let your mother overhear your rant. throw in a ultimatum.|`|3IimJWgXaa	honestly? you need to be a mother and PROTECT your child. its very sad but true, you need to tell your mother that if she cant stop being mean or saying hurtful things in front of you or to your daughter or to family members etc. that you wont come around any more. And so what if she says fine! Dont let that hurt reach your daughter... it reaches the soul. my grandma hates me and my mom never did a thing): <br>  <br>  its a hard decision. It really is, but you are a mother, and you have to protect your child from all harm. <br>  <br>  Thats why i love watching animal planet(:|`|e30cd21479ba61083d65bb804d7193edaa	You have to make a very difficult call, my dear. You MUST stop this, and stop it now. You need to tell your mother that if she can't show you and your daughter respect, you will no longer have contact with her. This is not fair to her grandchild, and this is not fair to you. It will do you both much more good in the long run if she can't clean up her act and treat you both like family, not like some back alley tra*p who got knocked up and ruined her life.
2jiNLOKHaa	yes!! this last time we baby danced the 10th and i ovulated the 13th or 14th. i gave up because i had to go out of town and i didn't think i had a shot at all. how could sperm last that long?? well, it worked because i am now 10w 3d pregnant with #1. sometimes those long shots really work. it did for me. it could work. :)<br>  <br>  p.s.~ have you tried ovulation kits? they aren't too expensive and they really help pinpoint ovulation.
nfLyS1toaa	how weird. i have 2 boys and they were both early and now that i am carrying my girl i am 4 days away from my due date and getting induced in 5 days. it seems like she doesn't want to come out and i keep thinking "what is wrong with my body" i want to have her so bad and nothing is happening. i have been dilated 2 cm for 2 weeks and she is still high. so i know how you feel. hang in there. it just seems like the 5 days aren't going by fast enough!|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Perhaps this will make you feel better, I am 40w and 5days, I have been having excruciating contractions every ten - 20 mins since tuesday and was only 1cm dilated last night when I went to the hospital, I was told this could continue for days and all I can do is put up with it so, you may go full term, but at least you're not overdue and in pain! Still, I understand your frustration and I hope things progress for you soon! good luck! x|`|paHjJrrdaa	Awwwwww. I'm sorry! *Huggs*  The time will be here before you know it. Just try to relax and keep your mind occupied. Your bundle of joy will be worth the wait :D Congrats!
XrnxZR25aa	I would wait, since you said you already messed up and just get a dna test after the baby is born. Then I would learn from my mistakes and not keep on with that type of reckless behaviour. It is not that baby that is the scariest part it is HIV and things of that nature. Be careful and good luck. I will be thinking of ya,<br>  Helper|`|DOoklOL5aa	Just wait until the baby is born.  They would have to perform an amnio and any procedure has risk associated with it.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Too dangerous to take the risk I think.  What would it hurt to wait until the baby is born?|`|PAdif484aa	it involves an amniosentisis which causes miscarriage in about 1 in 200 pregnancies. it is safer to wait until the baby is born.
AA11296427	LOL - If that's the music that made her/him... ?happy? I guess so.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, who the hell would destroy a song with those awful lyrics?<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|aQt6vaBKaa	I would allow my son/daughter to listen to whatever makes them happy, as long as they are mature enough. Lyrics shoudnt influence them anymore at that age, unless they havnt matured yet. As long as they express maturity and arent influenced by the lyrics and treat it as nothing more than a song, I dont think they should have any less authority to listen to it than you do.|`|WXcbE2H1aa	yes. if you try to stop them, they will only rebel and want to listen to it more than they did before.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I definitely wouldn't!!!|`|4ee54ecafcd27a5c9df5a6ba82910d47aa	WOW. NO WAY! I wouldn't listen to that kind of music myself. Why would you want to listen to something so dark and obscene?  I would not let any child listen to that kind of music. I think that sort of music brings them down, and makes them depressed. There are much more up lifting things they can listen to. They might be mad at you but I wouldn't allow that kind of music in my house.|`|W4k3ph7Saa	Wow. that's pretty bad!<br>  <br>  I'm not a parent, but i would try to understand what is it about this music that's so appealing, by asking him/her "hey, so what is it about this music that's so appealing?"...in an tone that does not make him/her feel like a child or stupid.<br>  <br>  I would then make fun of the musician (on a daily basis..or whenever it is that he/she is listening to this junk) in some way to make my teen understand how stupid these lyrics are. <br>  <br>  and THEN...i will try to bond with my teen and show them lyrics of the bands/artists I normally listen to, to prove to them that you don't need vulgarity to prove something.<br>  <br>  and then, yes, i would let them listen to this crap and hope that one day they will grow out of this....whatever it is...<br>  ...and they may grow tired of negative/vulgar lyrics =)|`|KifK5YfCaa	Some kids go through a phase of listening to extreme stuff. More importantly, the music is probably ****. I'm not a parent but if i ever have kids i won't censor what they listen to. I was always allowed to listen to whatever i wanted and i turned out ok.|`|NsWu6fMpaa	Obscene is subjective. They have been freaking out about the lyrics in music since the 50s....<br>  <br>  Having your teens listening to music isn't going to effect their actions...unless they already have issues to begin with.|`|6DoLTRX0aa	if i was a parent, which I'm not. i wouldn't let them, not on my life. that's horrible. no matter how old. that's not something i even want to listen to, and i'm a teen. god no. definitely not!|`|v5Bt0POlaa	i don't have kids, so I don't have to worry about that kind of thing<br>  <br>  I would not buy music like that, for anyone|`|EKs0IYaCaa	lol fck yeah...... i cant immagine what i would do if my parents wouldnt let me listen to the music i want..... dont restrain your kid from listening to the music that he wants, its fine....|`|bZ6RgXJcaa	hahaha. i wouldnt worry about it. calm down.|`|z1lUvWHOaa	That's not music, that's crap :)|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Are the lyrics of a song any obscene than the words in a novel?

If that were the case we wouldn't have works like Lady Chatterley's Lover.|`|z3Oed98laa	no i wouldnt
AA10624857	With my second baby I began to dilate and efface 3 weeks before his due date. He was born 11 days past his due date. My third baby, I began to efface and dilate 6 weeks before her due date and she was born 5 days past her due date. Unfortunately, dilation doesn't have any direct correlation with how soon active labor will begin. With my first and my fourth baby, I didn't efface or dilate until the day I was in active labor.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	doesn't mean a thing i was 2 cm and 50% at 32 weeks and id delivered at 36|`|113FoyMFaa	*dilated*<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it doesn't mean anything.  I was 1.5 cm dilated forever!  My kids are 5 years apart and I was overdue with my second.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I was 3 cm dilated for about 3 weeks! I'm sure this one will go quicker, hence starting to dilate already but no it doesn't mean it will be very soon.<br>  <br>  Good luck
Coc593Ikaa	MIscarriages only happen up to 20 weeks. After that, you can have a stillbirth, the odds of which are low.|`|QSodlfMraa	i am 24 weeks 5 days and i do not think i felt her move all day, and it is on my mind like what are the chance that i will deliver a stillbirth, but i hope every thing is ok with you<br>  good luck|`|PLgNsOF9aa	very small. <br>  <br>  babies can live outside the womb at your stage of pregnancy, that always made me feel better when i got to that point.|`|h3gKBLIaaa	I feel your pain! My first son moved ALL the time so I never worried but then my second son moved MUCH less and I would go all day and not have consciously felt him move so I would lay down and drink something cold to feel him move. The odds are very slim of miscarriage at 25 weeks, in fact it would actually be preterm labor since you have passed the 20 week mark (which is really good!) If you are concerned that he is moving less and less every day I would suggest doing a kick count at his most active time of the day every day for a week. Just lay on your left side for about 10-15 min and count how many times he kicks you. Write it down and compare every day and see if it is consistently decreasing. I know you are fine though. Every mother feels this way, it is just us preparing to be a mother and worrying for the next 18 years. Good luck and enjoy that baby boy...my boys are amazing!|`|1o820L3Daa	Im 25 weeks pregnant. and I know how you feel. Ive been having cramps the last few days, and went to my doctor today. I asked if everything was ok with my little man, and he checked and found that he had turned around, and has his head in my pelvis. Some days I don't feel him move around too much, but others I do alot. Im sure you will be fine sweety. If your really worried go see you doctor. Congratulations and good luck!|`|JvcJs8k9aa	i am 28 weeks. i just went to the doctor today for my scheduled appointment and asked my doctor about this. i had been feeling my baby move all the time and then all of a sudden she wasn't moving as much, or as hard i guess.. he said that it could be because she has gotten too big for the uterus and has little room to move. i would ask your doctor just to be safe though!
u6jP7BQNaa	Whoever told you that is an idiot.  I used to work in a daycare in the infant room.  Whenever i had period they did not break out in hives when I held them.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I have never heard of that before.|`|AA12300309	Not true.|`|Gz1XccKVaa	Nonesense. Ever thought that the mother of the infant bleeds for six weeks after giving birth. So she can't hold her baby or what ?
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Just like adults every baby is different.Look for signs that they are interested.  Around 4 months my son would watch us and cry when we ate.  He then starting reaching for our food.  <br>  <br>  We started slow with a couple small spoon fulls of really thin rice cereal, mixed with formula or breast milk not water.  He could successfully move food to the back of is mouth and swallow.  So I would give him a little more each day.  Around 6 months is when we started veggies and fruits.<br>  <br>  Even if they eat some food they still need their bottles for nutrition.  When I feed my son solids I still offer him a bottle.  Example:My son eats 8oz regularly, then when he eats 2oz of food give him a 6 oz bottle.<br>  <br>  Work with your pediatrician.  They can help you make a plan that is best for your baby.|`|IlIjGTdiaa	your poor child|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Never.  Oatmeal and rice cereal should always be spoon-fed unless you are specifically told by the doctor to put it in the bottles.  Also, the new recommendation is not to start solids until 6 months although 4 months is sometimes still recommended for formula-fed babies.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	And you're a bad mother too. Ask the peditrician.
168e1ad6c1f54e307a02551c3b7c8caeaa	I am not skinny, slender but I am top-heavy.  I started showing a small pudge until about 18 or 19 weeks.

EqQojVP9aa	I think it is impossible to know since you are so irregular. If you are trying for a baby I would track your ovulation symptoms, temperature, mucous, etc. each month for awhile to see if there is a pattern. Futhermore, make sure to talk to your doctor.  He should better be able to help you come up with a plan to try and pinpoint your ovulation dates.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|axaD1D0Caa	Its hard to now because your irregular|`|Egb1qpB6aa	i cannot tell you when you ovulate but i can tell you this...<br>  <br>  have the bd every chance you! do not give up if its what you really want!<br>  <br>  try taking prenatal vitamins... my doctor told me that it helps!
DiNUcBkLaa	eating/drinking cold things isnt going to harm the baby. if i were you i would not take 5 solid cold baths a day. the baby is sensitive to temperature changes. always monitor your temperature if ur taking hot or cold baths. if it starts changing quickly or once it changes 2 or 3 degrees get out. dont let it change any more. the temperature changes can put stress on the baby. i like to take hot baths and i always have to take a thermometer and check my temperature every 5 minutes. that was advice from my doctor.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	i know the cold water and ice cream wont hurt your baby and that cold baths wont as we are aloud to go swimming but maybe you should still check with your doc just to be sure because you are having 5 a day lol.. <br>  good luck and congrats :))|`|70Z4DJOcaa	that cant harm the baby :)|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I don't know about the bathing in cool water or showering in it either, I know that being too hot can be dangerous you should ask your doctor if being too cold is bad too. As for eating/drinking cold things I don't think its bad and I hope not because I went through 2 12-packs of popsicles in 2 weeks and I'm working on the 3rd bag! LOL|`|AA10967880	no it shouldnt harm the baby as the food is warmed by your stomach acid. <br>  <br>  i would be concerned bout the cold shower make sure you keep your temp regular as i dont think temp change would be good.|`|MduCpAWOaa	no it will mot harm the baby when i was prego with my baby gurl the last 3 months i are orange sherbet ice cream every day all day and my baby was born in tip top shape.|`|3hChyHo9aa	cold food no short cool baths are ok but u ont want to make the baby 2 cold it could send it into shock but cool is fine|`|XM41P9Tbaa	Yes it is fine to eat cold things and etc. But it is not good for you to take a bath. Your water can break will in the tub and you will not even feel it. Also your water could break getting in the tub or out of it. So please take a shower. I know that your feet hurt and are swollen but just shoke your feet in some Epsom'ss salt and hot water and that will help also going and pedicures helped to because they massage your feet and that does wonders for you.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	well, I know the cold water and stuff won't hurt anything, but I don't know about all the cold baths, I would ask your doc on that. good luck, and God Bless
lgIl0WgOaa	u usually see all of the baby on the screen.. but they take pics of the (boy/girl) part.. then hands, feet, spine and face.. they may couple extra depending on the ultrasound tech.. you can also bring a dvd or vhs and they can record it for you and give it to you if its avail in your office.. :)|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The scan will see all of the baby.

giKCTfnfaa	my midwife had no problems with an epidural even though she promoted completely natural childbirth.  the midwife doesn't do the epidural, an anesthesiologist does.  you might want to mention it to your midwife at your next appointment if you haven't gone into labor by then.  some hospitals require you to meet with an anesthesiologist before receiving the epidural to discus procedure and possible complications.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	I had a midwife and an epidural... no issues  stick with the midwife when you are ready for an epi she will let you have it.|`|1zTheHOQaa	i suggest that you keep your midwife if you have already developed a good relationship with them because it will make the birth alot easier for you. that's just my opinion though!|`|ETvV9aypaa	i had a epidural and two midwives delievered my baby. docs normally dont deliever babies. not that i hear anywyas. they just over see things... good luck.. and yes epidural is great lol gets u into the real experiance of having ur baby.. good luck

If you calculate the number of months based on four weeks to every month, it would appear that gestation is 10 months.<br>  <br>  But it's not. It's 40 weeks.<br>  <br>  40 weeks is 280 days and that's what you have to use to calculate.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that a month is not four weeks (28 days) long. A month is 30 or 31 days long. Over the course of 9 months, you  have more than 9 x 28 days. It's closer to 280 days.<br>  <br>  So if you are 32 weeks pregnant, you are 32 weeks pregnant. You have about 8 weeks to go to term.<br>  <br>  It's much less confusing if you think of it in terms of weeks rather than months.|`|70Z4DJOcaa	i always got confused about how many months i was... cause i'd divide it by 4 but it would never match to what the doctors would say... your pregnant for 40 weeks so techically thats 10months!!! i always said i got ripped off cause i thought pregnancy went for 9months - then suddenly there was an extra month WTF haha<br>  <br>  good luck not far now!!|`|WvWFmwQoaa	your 8 months.<br>  good luck and congrats on the bub. :)<br>  <br>  ps --- (i just have to say) some people are so mean- i don't know why they cant just give an answer instead on criticizing people when they ask a question it really is ridiculous isn't it.<br>  why is everyone always out to call other mums "bad mothers" when they dont know something?|`|VR9iC2ykaa	You are bringing a person into this world and you can't figure that out?

MR9iBgafaa	My baby was 4.5 months old when she caught a virus (it was gastric, caught from me) and she would vomit a whole feed.  It was scary, as we were used to the odd little dribble after a feed, and the vomiting just poured out of her mouth.<br>  <br>  Anyway she's 5 months now and it fine.  It took her 2 days to get over the vomiting and had the odd runny nappy for about a week.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if she acts fine and has no other symptoms, i wouldn't worry until she does.....|`|oECHtfYUaa	sometimes babies vomit for various reasons, the two most important things are is that she looks ok and she wants to play and active. you will have to monitor the vomit to make sure it isn't filled with mucous or there isn't any blood in it. the presence of mucous may indicate an infection. as long as there are no symptoms like fever or rash, i wouldn't worry about it. be sure to feed her something that will not be heavy on her stomach, like jello or broth. make sure everyone is using hand sanitizer and spray everything with a disinfectant. hope everyone feels better and good luck!|`|qzEva4H7aa	My youngest son puked for the first time just this week, but he had just ate and then started running around, he was perfectly fine after. My oldest son used to puke a lot but we realized he would do for attention and once he realized it wouldn't work it stopped!|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Babies vomit all the time. They get air bubbles and cant burp them up so they vomit. Its just part of being a baby.|`|NBGskcFhaa	im sure shes fine<br>  could of been something she ate<br>  my son used  to puke all the time<br>  and 3 doctors said it was nothing lol
oECHtfYUaa	even though they take in less air, it is still a good idea to burp after breast feeding|`|XM41P9Tbaa	You need to burp them after every feeding. They do get less air when they breastfeed but they get it. So try to burp after every feeding. Also if you want to cut down on him getting air while you bottle feed go and buy the playtex bottles with the liners. They also save you time not a lot of bottles to wash just the nipples and the lids and that is it. Hopes this helps out. And congratulation on your son I have two boys only 10 months apart they are a joy.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	You actually should burp every 5 minutes when breastfeeding, but if the baby gets upset and starts to cry very badly--if he's crying and you're trying to burp him, all he'll do is burp the air he's swallowed while crying; just continue feeding and burp at the end.|`|OfLyP6mgaa	Yes, always burp after each feeding, no matter how/what they were fed :)|`|wTeJulT5aa	You should try if you can.  I actually gave up on burping my daughter when I was breastfeeding her because she never took in enough air to burp.  And, most of the time she was asleep after eating, so I just let her sleep.  She was happy.|`|MduCpAWOaa	ye u should burp the little one i did when i breast fed

Most don't even notice when it happens.Take a hot bath then try to lay down for a nap. If pain increases or become regular don't be alarmed.You are probably in the early stages of labor.Trust me when it really kicks in you won't be on here trying to figure it out you will know.<br>  Can you say epidural?  lol|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, sounds like labor has started for you! congrats. I wish you all the best luck and a safe delivery for your new bundle of joy.Good luck|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	What the heck is a doctor in their right mind doing a strip at 37 weeks?|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Easiest way to differentiate between real and false labor:  labor pains are consistent, come/go, equally spaced.  False labor (what i call Braxton Hicks) more sporadic...very tight, belly feels like a brick--and sometimes stays that way for several minutes, eventually subsides---movement will often relax Braxton Hicks and they don't return...sometimes until the next day--certainly not an 'even' 5 minutes later or such; movement may EASE true labor pains, but they will return in an evenly timed fashion.  Another large difference:  the dull back ache you mention rarely accompanies Braxton Hicks.  <br>  <br>  I wonder that you had a sweep at only 37 weeks?  Thought that was reserved for 40 weeks for first timers, 41 for subsequent babies?? O well--you know best & am sure you had good reason!  As I'm sure they told you, contractions the day of the sweep are not unusual...time will tell...literally:  time these feelings, get up and walk a bit (to see if the tightening subsides) and keep the hospital number close.  Good luck!!|`|azE51WGRaa	Usually when you have your membranes stripped, it causes your body to go into true labor (which is what it sounds like you're having. It just isn't super intense yet). Good luck, sounds like baby is on it's way :)<br>  BTW:How did you get your doc to do one? I am 37w2d and want it done but don't know if I have to have special circumstances for it to be done. I'm sorry to ask you a question within an answer, just wanted to know. If it comes off inappropriate, I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  A doctor might strip a women at 37 weeks because A.)You're full term. It doesn't matter anymore. You're baby can be born anytime now without fear of weight, lung maturity, etc (in most cases, though I understand not in all).<br>  B.) Some of us, like myself, are a bunch of crybabies and so tired of being in pain for weeks and just want it done. When you've been in early labor 2 weeks, can't barely walk due to sciatica, and have to be put on ambien for sleep, then you'll understand why we want the dr. to perform a strip (and why some docs would do one as well). :)

My son is 6 months old and has never slept through.|`|OxFV92hJaa	My 3 went like this:<br>  <br>  1st- Had to wake to feed as a fresh home from hospital baby (doctors requset). Slept through without a feed for 6 hours at night by 3 months. By 12 months fought sleep, and raised holy he*l come bed time. Now at 4 years 4 monts, sleeps with a little whining at first for 10hrs a night. <br>  <br>  2nd- Woke ever 3 hrs as a baby for the first 6 months. Now at 15 months sleeps for 12 hours per night only waking once or twice a week.<br>  <br>  3rd- Woke ever 2 hrs to feed as a newborn(doctors request again, breastfeeding a baby born 5lbs11oz  3 weeks early). Now at 3 months sleeps for between 4-6 hrs at night. Wakes up to be changed fed and sleeps for another 1-3 hours.<br>  <br>  * My first and 3rd where both small babies and the docs made sure they woke to feed for the first 2-3 months. Rough on us, but they were tiny. 3rd came 3 weeks early. Both weighed 5lbs11oz at birth. <br>  Our middle child was 6lbs7oz, no special feeding schedule, and did his own thing. Now he at 15 months goes to his room and knocks on his own door when ready for bed (easy on us lol).|`|v9rzGYWoaa	Lauren seemed to sleep all the time the first couple months.

There is  nothing the doctors can do at this time, so the best recommendation is to get a box of home pregnancy tests...get a value pack with more than 1.

I had a miscarriage and lost my first baby in july 2008. the doctor told me that what is happening during a miscarriage is that u are technically in labor and delivering the baby at a point in the pregnancy where it cannot survive outside of the uterus. so you have labor pains like u do when u go to deliver at full term. they were so bad all i could do is scream and cry. ive never felt anything so painful in my life. if ur not experiencing that then ur not having a miscarriage more than likely. usually when u bleed during early pregnancy, if u do at all, its very light spotting. light pale pink to light brown. to me it just sounds like ur period. i am pregnant now but when we were trying to conceive the doctor told me that all the stress and anxiety from trying and wondering and hoping...all that can cause ur periods to get a little out of whack. when we started trying my periods started getting a little out of whack...much like what u are describing. one thing i will tell you that as soon as we stopped focusing on TRYING to get pregnant, it happened. lol. if u dont stress out about it and try so hard it will happen quicker.
prDNZIi6aa	Sounds like pregnacy symptoms! are u passed ur period? if so take a test! i would. I had the same thing, except my bleeding came back n i had a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|bUDcM8Q3aa	What your describeing could be pregnacy but I doubt it. It sound to me like your having a side effect of the two meds your on and also that your body is purging some of the vitamins in the prenatal vitamins. Your body can only use so much and then it gets rid of it. You also can cause your body to react like it is pregnant with some med combinations. Your breast being sore could be from anything from the size of your bra, circulation problems. What your describing though, in all the years Ive been a Paramedic, can be related to lots of things. The important thing is drink plenty of fluids and stay calm. stressing, no matter what the cause, will only make things worse.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	if your doctor has you on prenatal vitamins, then you're probably pregnant.|`|lW0DTaJAaa	they could be signs of preg but they could also be signs that your period is coming|`|OMTSqrSFaa	they sound like sign's of pregnancy and AF .. take a test to be sure <br>  <br>  good luck x
JNh3flW3aa	It's not a problem if she can sit up on her own. My son was 4 months old when he could sit up by himself. As long as the pushchair has sufficient back support you friend can feel as ease about having her baby in it, but not for too long periods.Make sure that the pushchair has adjustable straps/clips for different level of back support.<br>  <br>  My boy was very happy in his pushchair, just make sure the child has baby sunscreen on,wears a breathable  hat, wears a long sleeved vest(at least), and has some toys your friend could attach in front.<br>  <br>  Honestly I think parents worry too much about these things, just advise your friend not to get her baby a walking ring. It's not good for the development of a baby's motor skills. Here's an article about it  <a href="http://www.health24.com/child/Fun_and_fitness/833-858,24165.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.health24.com/child/Fun_and_fi...</a>|`|OfLyP6mgaa	Ummm, 1 week shouldn't make a difference for advisories, but I have no idea what you are talking about...|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	As you said the baby can almost sit up.<br>  My suggestion would be to put her in it for a minute and see if she looks comfortable. Umbrella pushchairs are aimed at toddlers, but in my local town I see lots of babies in them because they are cheaper. These babies look cramped and very unhappy.<br>  If the baby looks happy and the seat lays back a little she may be ok, but it is always the mothers decision.<br>  If it is one of those where the back doesn't lay back or move in any way I suggest she takes it back or saves it for when the baby is older.|`|3rda58OCaa	To be honest with you, it has more to do with how tall the baby is and if she can sit up well.  My baby could sit up at around 4 months, but since she was still so short she couldn't use an umbrella stroller.  The way they are made if the baby isn't tall enough it is very uncomfortable for the baby.  I wouldn't recommend it for a 6 month old.  They are really useless for a baby, and are for toddlers.
Wl8tRVWBaa	I was on the depo injection for 3 years, then came off as me and my partner wanted to try for a baby. After coming off it my periods were all over the place, sometimes I had 2 periods in 1 month! The doctor told me it was completely normal. They were irregular right until I got pregnant after trying for 8 months. Before I went on the depo injection my periods were regular. I think it takes the body a long while for it to come out of your system, a lot longer than if you were on the pill. I went on the pill after having my son nearly 3 years ago. We have been TTC for 5 months now so i'm hoping it will happen soon. I had a miscarriage 2 months ago, so I can see how much longer the depo took to come out of my system than if I was on the pill.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	For some women it bounces back right away for others it can take up to 18 months.

You would need to go to a clinic or doctor and they will give a blood test. Lower back pain and lower abdomen pain is not indicative of a early pregnancy ,unless you are having a tubal preg.If that is the case they will want to do a d and c<br>  on you asap. Your safest bet is to go to the doctor. Your symptoms read more like menstral symptoms than pregnacy. If you have a light one some times you have two in a month. This all depends on diet,age stress etc....|`|ksWm9eCBaa	Had to answer this one when I saw another poster stating your lil cramps lower abd and back were prob tubal preg. NOT Necessarily...at all!!!  Cramping in that area early on, while not everyone experiences it, is not unusual.  <br>  <br>  Wait til 03/24 and get a HPT.

nUayrVhQaa	there is always a chance. howeever...its SLIM. you waould have to be ovulating...and also, the sperm would have to travel up your vagina and into your uterus. the chances are SO SLIM i wouldnt stress about it.|`|br0gCYDBaa	Yes it is possible. But odds are slim.<br>  ROTFLMAO. No offense but I would love to know what has prompted this question?Why do you ask?|`|ksWm9eCBaa	In the Medical World everything's possible....remotely...but just barely.  What WERE you doing????|`|QwYLA6viaa	I am the person who asked the question but I am using another account because I cannot, for some reason, expand details onto the question.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm not sure of the name the area right below your stomach and it forms a triangle, but it's flesh, there's skin and pubic hair (if you don't shave). For example, when you see a female naked, you see that triangle, you don't see the inside of her vulva. Hopefully you guys know what I mean :]. The point is, that's where the sperm mixed with water fell. It did not go inside my actual vagina, it didn't get the chance to drip inside because I grabbed a towel and dried the area. I mean, I am pretty positive I cannot become pregnant but I posted this because I wanted some opinions from other people. <br>  <br>  To answer your question, my boyfriend and I were just done having sex, I was still naked, and what I usually do is pour water inside the condom just to make sure that the condom didn't break (b/c if the water leaks, then the condom is broken). Ok so, I poured the water inside the condom, the condom then slipped from my hand and some of the water splashed onto me. That's what I was doing.<br>  <br>  haha I know it's long, but I just felt like I had to explain things thoroughly.|`|V3b5UaXsaa	vulva...classic!|`|fCkibDidaa	No not at all.

A faint line is still a line you hormone levels may not have been high enough to make it darker just yet. To be sure go to the health department w/ your boyfriend unless you have told your mom. They will draw blood and confirm it immediatly. They can get you started on vitamins and give you a list of resources to help you wic, medicaid , housing ,etc...<br>  If your not then the can give you a free birth control shot or pills. Good Luck!!! P.S. calm down if you are then ,what is done is done and stressing this hard isn't good for you or the baby.|`|c0KJxdyjaa	a faint positive line is still a  positive.|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi,I would just hang in there and take another test in about a week.If you take the test and its neg, wait 2 weeks and get a blood test done.I took 5 home pregnancy tests and all were neg, i waited 2 weeks and got a blood test done.I was pregnant and i was 8 weeks along.I had low hcg levels at the time.Good luck|`|AA11330115	If you are really so unsure, and the test you took made it even more confusing, you should really make an appointment with your doctor, or your local Planned Parenthood.

OgJPjFHKaa	The only person who can decide that is you.  If you really want to have this baby, and you believe that you can take care of it, then you should follow your heart.  Believe in yourself - I'm sure you are strong enough to take care of your children without their support.  There are many support groups and social support systems to help single mothers.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you feel that you cannot handle a third child, and you feel you are unable to continue the pregnancy because it will be too great a stress on you physically/mentally/financially, or for whatever reason - that is your choice, and yours alone.  Please do not let other people pressure you or make you feel quilty about such a personal decision.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  :)|`|QdFOTKs9aa	Best advice:  Go talk to a health care provider, religious advisor, responsible & trustworthy mentor. <br>  <br>  Consider your options. If you do not want to raise another child, think about adoption. Abortion is the easy -and unfortunate- answer. Personally, I think abortion is the wrong answer. I was raised with a brother by a single mother that worked full-time and went to school as well.<br>  Here's a WONDERFUL resource you will find to be of great help: <a href="http://www.birthright.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthright.org/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|f96bc16cadcb85b092e0fc05cb19f8a5aa	how old are you hun?|`|H0fXySX9aa	hun there is always a way and it should be you wanting the abortion not your parents|`|yKS2UI87aa	No, do not get an abortion. They can't keep your children if they do kick you out call Social Services they can help with housing. Too bad that they are embarrassed, I think they will get over it. Killing a baby because Grandma is embarrassed is so wrong your baby did nothing wrong so why punish the baby? Stick to your guns and have your baby.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	THIS IS YOUR CHOICE. Talk with a health professional that can put your choices into perspective. No one should make this decision for you. It's YOUR life and YOUR body. Good luck.|`|8fbe337e2b372d5b39e76d1d6d5f91edaa	NEVERRRRRRRRRRRRR kill an innocent baby for your own personal confort. life sucks at times ya. but its not that baby's fault that you got prego. if anything give it up for adoption so that a family that cant have a child and wants one can take care of it and give it all the love it deserves. im sry that your parents are treating you badly about this. but things happen for a reason and we just have to figure out how to make the best out of every situation. *God bless*|`|DgX1kbl0aa	Hi, I don't think you should let your parents rule your life. If you already have two kids, it sounds like you're an adult that can make her own decisions. If you want the baby, keep it. Don't EVER let anyone talk you into something that you don't want to do. And by the way, your parents can't take your kids away without going to court and the court will not do anything if it's because you're pregnant again. Come on now, use common sense. Take care, I hope you keep the baby and stop letting other people shove their opinions down your throat and scaring you.|`|vygYFdsSaa	They were cool with the first two kids but not a third?? Weird...NEVER let another person pressure you into killing your baby. Its your choice and your choice only. It would be difficult but doable if you had to leave your parents' house. They have no way of "not letting you" take your kids unless they have legal custody. Do they? I certainly hope not. Anyways just make the decision by yourself don't let your parents threaten you into a decision you don't want. Good luck I know this must be rough for you and you're absolutely not an embarrassment
QdFOTKs9aa	Rule of thumb in the hospital is you need to let someone know when you are contracting 4 times/hour.  If you feel that your contractions are regular (getting more regular), call your physician/OB.  One thing to take into consideration is how long of a drive it is to where you are planning on delivering. At this point in time, you need to start keeping a log of the time a contraction starts and the time it ends (to show how long each contraction is lasting and how many you are having each hour). <br>  If you're wanting to move it along, number one thing for you to do is to WALK. Do some Lamaze exercises such as the birthing ball (rocking back and forth will help the baby move down into the birthing canal). Another way is to have sex. Prostaglandins will help ripen your cervix.<br>  Here's a great site with some helpful hints: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4415800_naturally-induce-labor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4415800_naturall...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck! :)|`|895XRbnJaa	nipple stimulation releases a natural pictocin (the drug they give you to speed up labor)<br>  having sex speeds it up<br>  walking<br>  taking a shower<br>  sitting on an excercise ball helps the baby drop lower and it will help you dilate faster|`|9ro8fiKvaa	For me the exact same feelings occured in my 40th week and it took ALL week long before my water broke.

I would just get rest tho you have a lot of work ahead|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	It is hard to tell when you will go into labor because every woman's pregnancy is different. But here are some things you can do to help progress your contractions, <br>  1: nipple stimulation for 1-2 hrs a day (15 mins each breast); <br>  2: walking<br>  3: sex as long as your membranes haven't ruptured and your doc says it's ok<br>  4: squating exercises on a birthing ball<br>  5: massage your achilles tendon on your ankles (right above your heel)|`|aWkp6AJOaa	other than trying to walk, walk, walk there is really nothing you can do, maybe have sex if you aren't too uncomfortable.  you may want to make sure you are plenty hydrated.  this will cause your uterus to contract.  the nurses at the l&d will make you drink a bunch of water to make your contracts stop if it is false labor.<br>  i wish you the best & hope you go into labor tonight!<br>  80% is good!|`|kVIOtS5gaa	No body can tell you when you will go into labor.

12VQ4ETcaa	It happens sometimes.  You might need to try a different pill - they come in different balances of estrogen and progesterone.  You should call the clinic and make an appointment.
5IJO3bzpaa	I too am a twin, i just wrote a paper on twins. Now i didn't do a ton of research but i basically found out that it is still unknown what causes identical twins to occur but that Fraternal twins can run in families. This is because there are genetic influences that can make multiple ovulations more likely. Women who have fraternal twins tend to produce eggs from both ovaries in the same month rather than from only one ovary at a time. This is a commonly hereditary trait passed from mother to daughter. If twins run in your family then you or your children could have twins. In my family it skips a generation, my grandmother was a twin, so my kids or my sisters kids could have twins, well at least we hope they do!! It sounds like a good question for the doctors and for your relatives.|`|hqafbKQRaa	even if you changed you are still identical. ok so female fraternal twins have a much higher chance of having twins themselves (39% more) as your mother would have released two eggs at the same time it could be genetic. but also there are other factors that contribute to having twins ie sperm (obviously!) so the males sperm count may be low so two sperms may not have reached each egg etc.<br>  identical twins are not genetically linked as its the egg separating into halves.<br>  hope this was a little helpful. <br>  and good luck with the rest of your pregnancy!|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Two plus two equals four.<br>  <br>  You will have two sets of quadruplets.  One set will be born three weeks before the other.<br>  <br>  This was revealed to me in a bowl of Ramen noodles.|`|KPmfrevlaa	im not a professional, but i'd say your chances are high.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	your chances look very high in having twins|`|pzLDXL6gaa	If you're a fraternal twin then it's a pretty high chance. Identical twin, not really becasue that's a random event with no genetic component. Also the genetic component is on the female side so the info from your husband's side isn't relevant.<br>  <br>  Harriet

r7q8LW7Aaa	It's usually to do with the skin's elasticity, and the actual delivery. If you have a good midwife/ obgyn doing the delivery, they can usually spot a possible tear on the way and ask you to stop pushing while your skin stretches.<br>  ETA - Candyman. My midwife did tell me to stop pushing and I panted for a few seconds - so it does work like that sometimes. If you still have some level of control (which of course many women don't), it's possible and actually not as hard as you think.|`|ETvV9aypaa	just depends on the person vagina i think lol. everyone is different. the higher the number the worse the tear... i had a 1st degree tear with my first baby and didnt need stiches lol|`|XVXOLkYoaa	Each person is different and our skin has different levels of elasticity. Also it can be related to speed of delivery, time spent in the birth canal, baby's size, delivering a breech baby can impact it, there are so many things...As for a midwife having you wait for your skin to stretch...lmao. If you're about to deliver and someone tells you to stop pushing for that reason I would smack them on sheer principle. <br>  My first son was delivered while my dr was not there and the nurse put her hand between my legs and held him in while waiting for the dr. My son had a large round bruise from this....But I tell you what, when they told me to breathe through the pain and not push, my body took over and pushed him out regardless. I tore because my son shot out like a rocket..lol. <br>  Doing kegels will help the muscles for more control but when the body wants the baby out, it will make sure it gets out...lol|`|hqafbKQRaa	alot of things can contribute to it.. how far the woman has dilated, the elasticity of the skin, the size of the neonate etc. <br>  some women tear right from vagina to anus!|`|C3cH7RALaa	depends on physical structure and will power

Like the life faced by children in AIDS and pverty stricken places. Where children can't attain education and leave the poverty because there are too many in their family.<br>  <br>  By sacraficing the life of a human who doesn't even know they ever existed, the lives of many more children- our future, is improved. I would like to see clinics in developing countries that provide safe abortions and after-care, plus future family-planning education to mothers.<br>  <br>  It may sound terrible, but advancement has always been made at terrible costs. Look at medicine, and what it has meant for animals.<br>  <br>  As a child-care worker, I have seen the result of neglect. These children become messed up adults. Messed up adults mess up society. You have to remember that all fetuses become babies, which in turn become kids, to teens, and adults. If you are pro-life only because you think of the babies, you have to remember the long-term.<br>  <br>  Despite the old "adoption is better" adage, the truth is, as much as 75% of surrendered babies end up aging out of the foster system, because their mother's did not give consent for adoption.<br>  <br>  If it was made easier for women to attain legal abortion, before the 12 week mark of pregnancy (before nerves are developed), then we would be doing society a favour.<br>  <br>  I hate to see the loss of life as much as the next person, but if that loss is for the greater good, then sometimes it is necessary.|`|gFZaJUGjaa	Whats the big deal I'm sure you've killed an ant before.

ClKxHUJpaa	I would also like a baby, and when I made my list, there were a lot more cons than pros.  In reality, I think there is only one good reason to have a baby and that is because you really want to.  Having a baby is not a logical decision, because children take away time, money and sanity. It is an emotional one.  And there is nothing wrong with that.|`|ipONHlcIaa	I think the proper reason to conceive is to take all that you can from the government.<br>  <br>  Apply for food stamps. <br>  Live in section eight housing.<br>  <br>  You won't have to work as hard if you have children.

When I got married again we decided we wanted another baby but we wanted a big family. Now we have 5 children (14 yrs old, 10 yrs old, 9yrs old, 2yrs old and 7 months). It has to be something you really want to do again. The big gap your girls might be a big help or they might be jealous.
G1ZgTqNcaa	They both do essentially the same thing, but the monitor is more detailed as it knows your body better, since you use it every day of your cycle.  When I was ttc, I used both.  The sticks are used for about a week starting a week after your period.  I used the digital sticks, so when you got a smiley face, you were ovulating.  <br>  <br>  The monitor you use every day of your cycle.  It tells you when you have high fertility, low and peak.  When it is peak, you are ovulating.  You can actually use the clearblue monitor sticks with the clearblue ovulation sticks.  It is much cheaper that way.<br>  <br>  They both worked well for me.  I liked the sticks because it was always exciting to see the smiley face.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!

C3cH7RALaa	7-10 days<br>  even u can know it, just after the sex <br>  it is successful for prig. or not <br>  if u didn't sit on knee after sex.......chances 100%<br>  if u didn't went to pee after sex.....chances 100%<br>  if u both just lay down n relaxed just after sex in best way...confirmed<br>  better u use the pills with in 72 hours of unprotected sex|`|ETvV9aypaa	u can test as early as 4 days b4 ur period is due.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	wait until ur period is due if it does'nt come do a test  the next morning with your first morning wee xx|`|U3wwPHz0aa	you should normally have sex on and around the 14th day after the first day of your last period (if you have a normal cycle 28days) that is normally your most fertile time. you should be dooin a pregnancy test nearer when ur period is due for a most accurate result but some test you can do as early as 6days before your period is due but the longer you leave it the more likely you are to know if you are definitely or not.|`|XVXOLkYoaa	I would say wait 7-10 days if you want to be confident in your results. The body will produce enough of the hormone by then to test positive if you are, I would recommend First Response if you use otc I know alot of people who took other tests and were neg and then took that one and it came back pos. The test is more sensitive than most so it is good for earlier detection...|`|3YIeusrYaa	you can do one like 2 days after sex|`|9iEhlRgUaa	I'd say wait untill your next period is due. If you start spotting blood and getting pregnancy signs before then, take one then.
XVXOLkYoaa	Honestly I usually hear about this in conjunction with uterine or in-utero manipulation. Surgery is only in extreme cases that I have heard of. Once the twin is moved she should be able to vaginally deliver if there are no other problems with the babies' presentation (neither is breech or transverse, no TTTS, etc...).
0fys57BNaa	I'm with you, Spencer Thomas Hewett|`|QB5D0rG4aa	i like the name seth|`|4qLhWtAjaa	I like Harrison Thomas Hewett if you tell people that it is Harrison not Harry i not keen on the others sorry can you not have Thomas as a first name i would go with Thomas Harrison Hewett|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Violet Hewett fits like it were pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.  I appreciate the repeating of "ett" on the ends.   Crystal compliments them both.<br>  <br>  For the boy:   First and last names beginning with the same letter sound like they have "class".   While I would encourage a first name beginning with the letter H,   you might search the baby names site for other acceptable H's.    <br>  (In my opinion, Harrison is preferable to Harold)<br>  <br>  My choice of your three names listed is Seth Thomas Hewett.<br>  <br>  Consider:<br>  Hans<br>  Herman<br>  Harman<br>  Herbert<br>  Heath<br>  Hagen<br>  Hahn<br>  Hal<br>  Hale<br>  Halsted<br>  Hammond<br>  Hampton<br>  Houston<br>  Homer<br>  Holden<br>  Homer<br>  Howard<br>  Hubert<br>  Hudson<br>  Hugh<br>  Hugo<br>  Hunter|`|t9FzbPyFaa	I love harrison actually i have never really thought about it but its a nice name! Its a little weird but he could be nicknamed Ris (or pr. reece). personally i prefer Harri as a nickname.  <br>  <br>  Although I had a friend named Harrison and we never nicknamed him!<br>  <br>  seth is nice too!<br>  <br>  Spencer sounds like a surname to me.|`|RsOuzdohaa	Seth and Hewett don't run together.

(:|`|pda2fjxkaa	I like Spencer Thomas. Not fond of the other names though. If your going to stick with Violet try a middle name without a "T", there's too many in the full name. I like the name Fallon (FAL-LYN) as well.|`|lY3jSaWdaa	In my opinion, Liam is a great name for a boy, and Jennette is a great name for a girl.|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	I was going to suggest Seth as a name, but then saw you already had it down. I like that name, Seth.<br>  <br>  How about Alexis? Or Quintin?

E2e485WRaa	You most likely ovulated on Wednesday, the day before your temp rise.  If you had EWCM on Tuesday then that was an extremely fertile day for you.  <br>  <br>  The only day you get can pregnant is when you ovulate. The day you ovulate, your body releases the egg. The egg lives a maxium of 24 hours. However, sperm can live up to five days in fertile cervical mucus but most live three days. Your fertile phase are the 3-4 days prior to ovulation and the day of ovulation.<br>  <br>  When using an OPK:  Most people will ovulate 12-48 hours after the LH surge is detected, most common is 36 hours after the actual surge.<br>  <br>  There is a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant each cycle that you have sex during your fertile phase.
EfhBkUaPaa	I am 34 weeks along and have fainted twice already....the first time was at 30 weeks and then a couple of weeks ago. I went to the ER and was told it was a drop in my blood pressure and the fact that I have become anemic while pregnant. The first time I even hit my stomach as I fell on to my hard wood floor... the baby was monitored and is okay! I found that sitting up after laying down before getting up or not staying still for long periods of time...gets my blood flowing and I am less dizzy!|`|eabe182e629146523f7d07ea0512f03caa	I have medical problems and when I was pregnant I fainted a couple of times so it is some what common. Yes, it happened again. I think it happened because I wasn't doing what I need to be doing which is relaxing, getting plenty of fluid and eating, rest. I was told it was my body telling me to slow down.|`|C3cH7RALaa	yes its common<br>  but be sure it is just due to prig. or ur other problem.<br>  be brave n read good books <br>  avoid stress n try to calm<br>  enjoy the movement of ur baby in tummy<br>  make urself ready for motherhood with strong will power|`|IlNVHrHOaa	I fainted twice at the later stage of pregnancy, I was very tired both times.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	iv not fainted but i go really really light headed and feel like im going to faint it is normal when your preg its just the blood pressure dropping really low x|`|Kq7Rcyy5aa	Thats normal. But when you get pregnant you lose a quater of your brain, im not sure about that thow.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	My ex fainted a lot during the last few weeks of her pregnancy, it didn't help that it was very hot weather.  We now have a healthy 7 year old girl.|`|ISjFdI1taa	I used to get dizzy - its caused by low blood pressure and low blood sugar levels don't help.  Try to get up slowly and take small frequent snacks - it helps.|`|AA11795652	I blacked out while sitting in a desk chair at work.  My co-worker said my eyes were open but I wasn't responding.  I was about 30 weeks pregnant at the time.  I asked my doctor if I should go to the hospital and she said not to worry as long as I was still feeling the baby move which I did.  She told me to eat more often (which I was already doing) and to wiggle my hands and arms around before attempting to stand up.  I felt too weak to drive home so my husband came and picked me up from work.  It was really embarrassing.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I fainted a few times in the early stages of my pregnancy...every time I looked up at the ceiling I could feel myself sway so I stopped doing that. It wore off naturally as the pregnancy progressed though and I have never felt faint since.<br>  Good luck sweetie|`|197Xps6Raa	I fainted quite alot all through my first pregnancy.  I think it was due to low blood pressure (better than being too high).<br>  Avoid being on your feet too long, find somewhere to sit as soon as you feel that lightheadedness coming on and get up slowly from sitting or laying down.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	I fainted at 9 weeks & often feel quite faint, I don't know what causes it. I had only ever fainted twice before I got pregnant.
zKDHetmEaa	Hey Honey,<br>  <br>  I know exactly what you are saying.  I know there is some reason why doctors prescribe it for days 2-6....but I was prescribed it for days 5-9.<br>  <br>  My first month the clomid didn't work - but then when it was 100mg and day 5-9 - it was the lucky combination for me.....<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, I hope that it works for you -  you deserve to be pregnant, and you deserve to have a baby! <br>  <br>  I hope your dreams come true, email me if you fancy a chat.<br>  <br>  Good luck pretty star!!! xxxxx tons of baby dust to you!|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Hey, im not entirely sure why they advise certain people to take on certain days, maybe it is for that reason alone - certain people need it on certain days, perhaps to do with cycles etc.<br>  Mine were 42days before Clomid and i take on day 2 of cycle - bringing me down to a 30day cycle, was prescribes 50mg for 5 days, but worked too well, so reduced to only taking 3 as per Drs request, but this was my 5th cycle and i took it upon myself to take an extra one  so i took 4 this mth, still starting cycle day 2 - im 7dpo roughly, due on 17th March  -fingers crossed.<br>  I had HSG thismth too and was all okay - but still hoping it gave me a little clean out and helps in process!<br>  Its annoying isnt it having to do this that and the other sometimes but sure it will be worth it in the end when we have our BFP's and babies .  .<br>  Feel free to mail me/add me if you have anymore Q's xx|`|2f6diQBiaa	Research has shown that taking it earlier produces more follicles, which is why many doctors prescribe it that early. However, there has been no research to show that taking it earlier or later affects pregnancy rates. I would take it as prescribed so that you and your doctor are on the same page should he/she decide to monitor you with ultrasounds (it makes a difference in when they decide to monitor you).|`|rYupVGyFaa	I would do what your doctor tells you. I took it from days 2-6 and fell pregnant on my third month (2 months of 50mg then 1 month of 100mg)<br>  <br>  Definately follow your docs instructions and if you are still insure, speak to him/her about switching days.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  xx|`|jfILd1X4aa	no harm is there!
9x1rK3Vgaa	sounds like you shouldn't be dating...<br>  <br>  honesty is the only way to go...otherwise you'll feel guilty for the rest of your life.|`|iORKgGG2aa	even if its gonna be painful safe yourself the guilt trip and tell him the truth don't cause yourself him and the baby any pain you wouldn't want it to grow up thinking some man its its father when it really isn't.<br>  <br>  DO NOT have an abortion everyone deserves to live<br>  you wouldnt like it if your parents aborted you?<br>  <br>  now would you? =[|`|bV3zmolLaa	IF YOU REGRET IT TELL YOUR HUBBY BEING WIT HIM WAS A MISTAKE AND IF HE REALLY LOVES U THEN HE WOULDNT MIND...IM AGAINST THE WHOLE ABORTION THING SO I WOULD FIND ANOTHER WAY TO GET THRU THIS THAN ABORTING....|`|AA11707728	You should leave....so that your poor husband might have a chance to find a good woman and have the happy marriage he will NEVER be able to have with you.  <br>  <br>  Be honest with yourself at least.  Your "not getting along" had little to nothing to do with the affair.  Rather, the reasons behind why you had the affair are what cause the problems in your marriage.  You are not a loyal person and have no respect for yourself, let alone your husband.  You did something really intolerable....quite frankly, your husband will freak out and abandon you for it...that's how bad it is.  You rationalized it after the fact but the truth is you did it because you just don't care about your marriage or your husband.  Is that what your husband would want to be married to, given the choice?  I highly doubt it. You were even so uncaring of the consequences you allowed yourself to get pregnant.  Even worse, your child means so little to you that all you can see is how inconvenient it is in preventing you from covering up your shameful behavior.<br>  <br>  Look, do both yourself and him a favor and take a powder.  Just gather your stuff, get out, and file for divorce.  Sure, your husband will be devastated.  But he will recover and he will find someone better who won't do that to him.  Because let me tell you something.....you'll just do it again.  Eventually, you will abandon him on some flimsy pretext, probably after you have children.  You will destroy his life, your children's lives and your own life in the bargain.<br>  <br>  If you ever cared about him even a little bit, you'll spare him that crap.|`|ZnHTfNycaa	You have a few options.<br>  <br>  1. Get an abortion and don't tell anyone about the affair or pregnancy.<br>  I don't recommend this one because there are no winners here. Everyone pays for the mistake. Your husband is oblivious to the fact that his wife cheated on him, the boyfriend never gets the chance to have his say about his child, the child dies, and you have to live a life of lies. No one wins!<br>  2. Lie and tell your husband that the child is his.<br>  I don't recommend this option either for numerous reasons. One day the truth could come out and it would be horrible. Besides your boyfriend deserves to know that he has a child and your child deserves to know his/her father. <br>  3. Don't tell your husband about the pregnancy and leave him.<br>  I don't like this option either. Your husband should get a chance to make his own decisions regarding your pregnancy and affair.<br>  4. Tell your husband about the affair and pregnancy and inform your boyfriend that he is going to be a father.<br>  Best option here. Your husband deserves to know the truth even if you do regret the affair. Your boyfriend deserves to know that he is a father. If none of you are ready for a baby, you can give the baby up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what you decide to do with the baby, everyone needs to know what is going on. It is not right that only you get to decide what to do.<br>  Please tell them.<br>  Good luck!|`|RJQlvMyMaa	I would need more details before I could give you an honest answer.<br>  But in the mean time maybe you should just pack up and move up North and start over again.|`|rpK7ZUKBaa	Get a life, you are a selfish ****** !|`|OUo9J4i1aa	Do you think he would notice if you didn't? I'm just saying.|`|e7zXr9ozaa	Go on Maury Povich. That show was made for people like you!|`|br0gCYDBaa	Wow! <br>  Thats a tough one.<br>  Are you 100 percent sure it is not his? Do you plan on making things work or are you thinking about a divorce? If you keep the baby odds are the truth will come out like it or not. If the other guy sees that your pregnate and wants to be a father you will have no choice. What I would suggest is to take a step back and consider everyone involved not just yourself. If you keep the baby and can't avoid the other guy or at least convince him it's not his , then yes you have to set your husband down and confess.If you can make a clean break with the boyfriend and keep the baby ,and not tell your husband the truth.You have to ask yourself if you are prepared to live with these lies your entire life? This would mean lying to your husband,child,and the childs father. This is all asuming blood types wouldn't give it away.That kind of a secret is a heavy burden to bare.You could abort but that still leaves you lieing to both of them indefinatly. I don't know your beliefs concerning abortion , I don't feel it is right , but I am not in your shoes.<br>  I personaly would ditch the boyfriend keep the baby and let everyone believe it was husbands baby.If that was not an option I would wait until I was four months along (risk of misscarriage decreases by90 percent then) Come clean with my husband and guy on the side and take it from there. If they both drop and run I would be a single mom or adopt the child out to a couple. Some will cover medical and living expenses.No matter what you choose you have to start considering these other people.You can be happy or successful in any marriage if you only look out for yourself and your own needs. That rule applies to us all.|`|MXXOICquaa	just tell him, he may have had an affair to and understand and if he doesnt oh well, you were meant to have this baby if you got pregnant with it and if you still want to be with your husband you can always put the baby up for adoption if he doesnt want it but i wouldnt start off telling him im pregnant id start off with the affair and see how he takes it first|`|WZQKevt8aa	I don't think that's the right way to go about it. Tell your husband and tell the father, they both might surprise you, you never know. If in the end, you can't care for the baby, give it up for adoption to a couple who can care and love for a baby.|`|veLR9eoxaa	do what you want not what you think you should do <br>  <br>  what dya want to do dnt listen to your conscience listen to your heart<br>  <br>  and listen to this song aswell (itll influence you) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6uARpqekIY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6uARpqek...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  enjoy xxxXxxx|`|C3cH7RALaa	u r intelligent and smart enough <br>  try to hide ur emotions n expressions b4 and after abortion<br>  good luck|`|qmu80Gllaa	tell him first he might not care but dont do anything you will regret later on in life!|`|OJIZQYDcaa	I'd stop being a Skeezer.|`|Fx77zYhWaa	go for it.

3w4lRAUraa	wtf?
Z7dKEJcgaa	Hi.  I never felt anything until 22 weeks so I would say you don't have anything to worry about.  I was concerned like you, as lots of posts on here mentioned people feeling things much earlier.  It all depends on how baby is lying, your own body weight etc.  Within the next month you will be getting pushed and kicked all the time x|`|wKuQC4yTaa	Very normal especially with your first. Some don't feel them till closer to 24 weeks. But since you are feeling movement sometimes it's not much longer before you are going to feel them daily|`|AA11354548	No, don't worry.  They'll start getting stronger onces you move up in weeks, congratulations on your new baby :D|`|TlFnIei0aa	It should be fine and pick up a bit over th next few weeks.|`|DiNUcBkLaa	no. my OB told me on my last visit that generally you wont feel the baby move for the first time until around 18-21 weeks. and he told me that even then you wont feel it a lot. <br>  <br>  if you continue to be worried about it just discuss it with your doctor and he/she will reassure you. Your doctor should be asking you about fetal movement at your appointments, and he/she will more than likely tell you if they think it sounds like something is wrong.|`|7iYfjiWUaa	i personally wouldnt worried. but theirs nothing worse than it playing on your mind id go to the hostpital or book an appointment with my doctor just to examine me then your mind will be put at rest.|`|nSva5cblaa	no baby should move alot once u r 7 or 8 mon n if no movement dont worry i was 22 weeks n i felt it very mild till 24 n up they got stronger dont worry|`|cNuRToGFaa	you tend to feel more movement at around 23-25 weeks but if your worried go see your midwife and they will be able to help but your mind at rest<br>  good luck|`|DmN5gHMaaa	Don't be worried...I was the same way and now at 27wks I feel him move all the time...my dr. also had told me not to worry, movements get stronger as he grows :)|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Not at all =)<br>  <br>  I'm 23+6 and it's only been the last couple of weeks that I've felt more regular movement and remember thinking the same thing as you especially since this is my 3rd baby.<br>  <br>  If you're ever concerned call your midwife for reassurance x|`|EFc8VGwRaa	no dont be worried it is completely normal to only feel very little movement, as most people dont feel movement between 20-24 weeks..you still have heaps of time left to feel your little one move so dont be worried he/she will be rolling around and kicking your inside in no time..good luck and congrats..
7imMv3Niaa	military camp pronto       respect and discipline<br>  tell your wife to change or you wil kick out her and /or your son.|`|2BceQT7waa	That's a hard one. She's spoiling the kind, and certainly not doing him any favors by enabling him. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but in this case, I really don't see any alternative. I don't know if it's too late to rescue your son, but you might be able to rescue your marriagel.|`|PLeFgKEHaa	Here is what I would do. First of all be a bit more open to your son. Try to see the good in him. Also let him go out when he wants to. Let him have his freedom. If he can score a 17 year old girlfriend he should be praised. Now I do personally believe that if he is acting this way he should be diciplined. And no don't threaten to kick your family out of the house. If you being more open to him does not work, then you should in my opinion start taking away privelages until he gets the hang that you and your wife are in charge. Tell your wife no once in a while too and see if that helps.
LeaUjOoUaa	Babies and young children shouldn't use decongestants so you are limited in what you can do. Use some saline nasal spray like Little Noses or Simply Saline and use it to clear out the congestion. You can spray it into each nostril. It will thin down the mucous and then you can use a bulb syringe to suck it out. Keep this up several times a day. Also, your sinuses drain when your nose is forward and down so you may also try carefully placing your baby so the face is downward and forward (almost upside down). <br>  Another good help is steam. You could sit in a steamy bathroom with the hot water running in the shower or get a hot humidifier for the bedroom.<br>  Good luck and hope your little one is feeling better soon.|`|KMcEQxnZaa	Babies must be kept warmits sad that the lilttle one has developed congestion,do not give any medicines try giving him some plain water several times to clear out the mucus|`|NdUF4nrsaa	You can't give an infant cold medicine, so the only thing you can do is use the thing that sucks the boogers out of your babies nose.  If your baby is still sick after a day or 2, take the baby to the doctor to make sure everything is ok.|`|hIoxij6eaa	Saline nose drops & an aspirator (boogie sucker). You can also get baby versions of a chest rub, go to the chemist and ask what they would recommend for a 5 week old|`|ewQyJvNeaa	Do you have one of those mucus sucker things?<br>  You push in the round part, place the end in the nose (not too deep) then release and it sucks out mucus.
QBlJj924aa	By your question...you aren't ready. Please wait!|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Maybe you should both go to the doctor and get fertility tests done.|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	have u had sex on your most fertile days? try having sex every other day after your period. once you see egg white cervical mucus than have sex and hope for the best!|`|6HNxcFtZaa	Have you seen a doctor yet?<br>  They would give you the best answer. But never give up i know heaps of people who have tried and tried and have finally got themselves a child.<br>  Hope it helped|`|Vc1CT2e8aa	See a doctor, there may be something wrong, maybe not, but you should get checked out before you start trying, so ou know.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. :)
E2e485WRaa	You should wait until your doctor tells you it is ok again.|`|79eRDIbXaa	If you have experienced spotting then I think its best to wait till after 12 weeks just to be safe.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	After the spotting subsides.|`|HoonZJMgaa	I would wait at least 2 weeks and then take it easy when you do get it on. I know how your hormones are raging I am pregnant as well but baby is more important. I am 22 weeks and cant do anything until I deliver! So wait just to be safe.|`|C3cH7RALaa	for a amazing baby u should stop sex when u both n specially wife feels now its enough.<br>  i just did sex till 3 months of her prig.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	id say until after 12 weeks speak to ur midwife n she will advise you x
