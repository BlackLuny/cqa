20090220091917AAjQu4i	Sports;Hockey	Has Bob Gainey done a poor job?	I like Bob Gainey but it seems to me that since taking over as the Habs GM he has made too many questionable moves.       He also does not address his team weaknesses.        I know that when Gainey took over, Montreal was in worse shape then they are now (decent development of prospects) but it does not take away from the fact that I can name a dozen terrible moves/non moves that Gainey has made.       Even the most recent......Mathieu Schneider..OK seems harmless...but for a team up close to the cap with holes to fill, an overaged spare part Dman making 6 Million a season.....hell, Schneider's pro-rated salary is almost 2 Million! (the Habs cap hit)........seems to me that Atlanta should have been giving the Habs draft picks to take him.       My Questions-       What has been Gainey's BEST MOVE as GM?       What has been Gainey's WORST MOVE as GM?       I think the upcoming trade deadline will define his GM tenure with the Habs. It should be interesting to see how he plays it.       BTW, one thing I will say is that he has not mortgaged the future (almost to a fault)

I haven't really ran a bunch since they made me in high school (sports) and being out of school, getting older, and fatter, I want to start jogging again. How would I go about starting? I'm in good health and work out regularly, it just seems like when I get on the treadmill at the gym or if I go out for a nice 'jog' (which turns out to be like 2 minutes of jogging and 15 of walking) I get tired and my legs start to hurt. I might be 20 pounds overweight, I don't consider myself fat, just out of shape..How should I start again, and what can I do about shin splints?    When coaches ran our butts off in school it was either run a mile, or until they told us we were done, so I have no clue how to just start and work my way up to a certain number of miles. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!!   Oh, and I'm in good health, I'm in my 20's, I eat healthy, no medical conditions, yadda yadda..   Thanks!!

20090220100440AAQPlXT	Sports;Running	Running track after quitting smoking?	I have been smoking occasionally for about 2 years. It wasn't until about the fall of last year that I started to smoke heavily. However, I quit within about two/three months of doing so. Recently I have only had two cigarettes, but I am ready to be done for good. I am supposed to start conditioning for the school track team in about a week. I am scared to death about the fact that I won't be able to do it because of my old smoking habit. I know that I might be able to push through but it is going to be really hard. It is probably going to hurt like hell too. Does anybody have any advice for me?

20090220102323AAqZ9Ar	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	Is this a Genius Formula for distributing spots in the World Cup?	(Sorry for bragging)   This is the formula:   Europe gets 14 spots   Africa: 4   Asia: 4   North America: 4   South America: 4   Oceania: 1   Now you may be saying "That's only 31 spots. You need one more." Well I have the answer: Give the last spot to the continent the World Cup is on. This works perfectly for those 4 continents with 4 spots (Africa, Asia, North America, and South America).   For example, this year, according to my formula, Africa will get 5 spots instead of 4. Now you may be saying "That isn't fair", but if you think about it, it is fair. Since South Africa is already in the World Cup, it's like Africa has 4 spots.   Now what if the World Cup is in Europe or Oceania? I have two options:   1. Give the last spot to Europe/ Oceania.   2. Let the four continents with 4 spots play for it. (Like a playoff or something)   I've haven't decided what would be better.   Thoughts?

20070205052105AAjyMhr	Sports;Football (American)	Why was Manning MVP of Superbowl 41 ?	Payton Manning won MVP with just 1 TD pass..he also had 1 interception, and 1 sack..   - nothing impressive..-   his pass percentage was just 25 of 38 ...which for him is normal percentage..as regular season.      the Colts *Defense* scored over half (17) of the total (29) points .. Peyton wasnt even on the field at those times.      His team had nearly 80 chances ( 80- plays) and yet they only defeated the opponent by 12 points.. ' which is NOT a super lose..some Bowl games are decided by 20 + point differences..      I think someone just felt 'sorry" for Peyton having been "close" but never winning until today.   his stats are NOT impressive in this game.   -   Rookie : Addai' set a new superbowl record .. he should be CO-MVP         I think Manning is being    overated" .. on this victory..only!      Otherwise he is a great QB and Im happy i won money on this game..but lets be honest..his performance was not "super impressive" it was a "normal day for him".. YET outstanding for others

What do you think of athletes who skip their last year or two of college and go pro?  I realize that their driving factor is money and I understand the desire for all the wealth that goes with professional football, basketball, baseball, etc.  What I am wondering is, when their career is over, their money sometimes is unwisely spent for whatever reason, and they are physically used up, what do they have to fall back on if not their college degree. When they go pro, they sometimes throw away a full ride scholarship that non-athletes would kill for, and glory in the excesses of professional sports.  Wouldn't they be wiser get that degree and have something to fall back on?

20070221215738AAApRi0	Sports;Basketball	Bynum for Kidd swap, yes or no?	Okay, so in Bynum, you have a young center who has much potential, much room for improvement, and has proven already to be quite the shot blocker (see the one he had against Mike James). Ultimately, though, he may or may not turn out to be a bust. And if he doesn't, by the time he comes into his own, Kobe may already be past his prime.   But there's no denying the fact that Bynum has balls (see the dunk he had against Shaq last year)...      In Kidd, you have an aging all-star who might work in the triangle offense or might not (i.e. The Glove, more like The Rag these days). But at the same time, Kidd & Kobe, along with L.O., could form a dynamic trio during Kobe's prime.      So, would you pull the trigger?       PS If the trade were to happen, what would happen to Abdul-Jabbar, who was hired solely to train/coach Bynum? Would he be shipped to NJ, too? lol.
