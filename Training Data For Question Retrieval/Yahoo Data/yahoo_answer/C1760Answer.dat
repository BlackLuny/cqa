swiOhDo2aa	Anyone born there is individually indigenous.<br>  <br>  A population or culture is indigenous if it has been there long enough to become established and "a part of the scenery".<br>  <br>  With nation states it is a little more tricky. I would say that a nation is indigenous when it has existed long enough to rule itself, peaceably collect and spend taxes, and produce the next adult generation.<br>  <br>  If I apply these general rules to Israel and Palestine, I must conclude that the Jewish and Islamic factions are both indigenous - for what it is worth.|`|cIttXzrwaa	Anyone born there regardless of ethnicity, religious affiliation, political affiliation, etc.
Hxttt7G0aa	The liberal media and the entire entrainment industry went after her like their hineys were on fire.

AA11015890	I think it's both exciting and scary.  Part of me does believe in life beyond Earth, but the other part finds it almost impossible to comprehend.<br>  <br>  I wonder whether human beings could adapt to life on a planet that is not identical to earth but nonetheless has life-friendly properties?<br>  <br>  And it doesn't necessarily have to be the discovery of a planet capable of sustaining intelligent life.  I can think of plenty of people I would love to see blasted into space who wouldn't qualify as intelligent life - many of them currently inhabit the House of Lords and YA! lol|`|c9aaa62ae49fd88ebc431c66a11f06b1aa	I believe that it is really naive to think that "we" are alone in such a vast expanse like space.<br>  My only worry is that any intelligent beings or entities will shun us for letting retards like Bush etc. control most of our planet.<br>  Still - we,ll wait and see.|`|f58b2b418157b16c12987703e17e6ab7aa	I think humans are the optimum life form. The only being superior to humans God. I'm open to other forms existing, however I don't believe that they will consists of every aspect, element, or capability of humans. <br>  <br>  Radically different? Why not? If we can exist anything could. In fact, I'm egotistically, and maybe naive enough, to believe that if other life forms do exist on other planets, then it is so because earth/human needs. In other words, it's part of the universe and a plan so great because we ARE.<br>  <br>  That's pretty wild?

It's small fry compared to the London Olympics, where billions are being spent on structures that will have no useful value after the two-week event is over.<br>  <br>  How much do the Taxpayers Alliance think a lamppost costs, exactly? Do they think Tesco do a Value range of lampposts that only cost ￡99.99?<br>  <br>  The Guide Dogs spokeswoman has a valid point about the shape of the new posts, but there's no reason to believe that fitting more conventional lampposts would represent a significant cost saving. Or should we just leave knackered old lampposts in place until they rust right through and fall over?|`|aLNLl482aa	Well it may well indeed be a huge waste of money BUT two alarm bells.<br>  <br>  1.

Maybe the powers-that-be in Ashford hope they can deter the riff raff by up-grading it's appearance?|`|9kTejB0uaa	Actually it's not all bad.  These street lamps are going to help reduce polution for a start.  It's unfortunately they've been given the label of 'designer'.  I think they are cheaper to run too.  They are talking about doing this down in Cornwall too, coupled with switching off at 12.30 until 5.30 in the morning, which would suit be fine (whether burglary etc. will increase then might force me to change my mind!!) because I have a street light that has forced me to buy thick curtains to shut it out!!|`|R0mZqqfXaa	In a recession they should give everybody some of their tax back in cash, What a waste.

dKPFjQymaa	Zionist terrorism was the first form of terrorism in the world and it continues to spread today.<br>  <br>  You can not easily get rid of it, there are puppets that sit inside western societies preaching christian fundamentalism theories for Israel, as well as zionists inside various levels of government.  These people would rather see the success of Israel over their own country and western countries are actually hurting by supporting that aprthied state.<br>  <br>  It is just astounding that they can take tax payer money to support this israeli zionist cause, how much? over billions and billions of dollars.<br>  <br>  It's disgusting,<br>  protest , write to your government officials, boycott israeli goods and those that support the zionist state.  Make an impression, impact.  Join with people and continue to spread the message of how dangerous the Israeli Zionist regime is.<br>  <br>  It has hurt everyone, the worldwide situation we are in today, we would not be in if it wasn't for the support of Israel.

And he is doubling the troops in Iraq.<br>  Not to mention further bankrupting the nation on "wars" we don't need to fight.<br>  <br>  2  Said he would have no lobbyists in his cabinet and has appointed nothing but lobbyists.  Example Ex monsanto man to head up the department of Agriculture.<br>  <br>  3 Said he is for peace but names Rahm Emanuel Hawk for wars in iraq,iran, Afghanistan and son of a murdering zionist terrorist as chief of staff.<br>  <br>  4  Took more wall street/bankers money then any other campaign in history and surprise surprise.  Barrows trillions of debt from the federal reserve(@interest) gives it to the banks(members of the fed system with no oversite) to be loaned back to the taxpayers(@interest).  <br>  <br>  5 Demands that his stimulus be passed without anyone reading it.   Said all bills would be posted online for 5 days before vote.  Lie.   Same stunt he pulled supporting the tarp bill.

Okay, some people only make 12000 a year.  Even spread out over years, that is not good for the people making less than 30 thousand a year.  <br>  Now, think about the Wallstreet, bankers, etc that have been bailed out.<br>  They keep their jobs with their hefty salaries.  Oh, yes, don't forget that those getting help from the bailout have a capped salary of lets say 250,000 a year?  That's more than some people will see in their lifetime working minimum wage.  It doesn't make sense, but at least Obama is trying so once again I have to give him a 10 for effort.|`|3CnOAAF9aa	Too early to tell...but I don't think giving MORE money to people (banks,etc.) that couldn't handle it in the first place is going to solve the problem. And, everyone wants to blame Bush for the economy.

"Subprime borrowers are more likely not to pay the money back, such as those who have a history of not paying loans back, those with a recorded bankruptcy, or those with limited debt experience....A steep rise in the rate of subprime mortgage defaults and foreclosures has caused more than 100 subprime mortgage lenders to fail or file for bankruptcy,"<br>  I copied my quote from Wikipedia but further research can be done on more reliable websites.|`|GHD8JicSaa	1............

It has now been one year (12 months) since gun <br>  owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal<br>  firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing<br>  Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.<br>   <br>  The first year results are now available:<br>  -Australia-wide, homicides are up 6.2 percent;<br>  -Australia-wide, assaults are up 9.6 percent;<br>  -Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent); <br>     In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up <br>     300 percent as compared with the last one year period when private <br>     ownership of a firearm was legal.<br>     (NB: the law-abiding citizens did turn in their personal firearms, <br>     the criminal element did not and thus criminals in Australia still <br>     possess their guns.) <br>  -While data for the 25 years preceding the confiscation of privately<br>  owned guns showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, <br>   this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months as criminals <br>  now are assured their victims will be unarmed. <br>  -There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults <br>  of the elderly, while the resident is at home. Australian politicians are <br>  at a loss to explain how public safety has<br>  decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in<br>  successfully ridding Australian society of guns.' <br>  -This story of well intentioned government intervention in the <br>  rights of lawful individuals to own and possess firearms won't be seen in the<br>  mainstream US media or on the American evening news. Senator Obama <br>  who advocates a similar confiscation in the US will not be reporting <br>  any of this to you. But, the Australian experience speaks for itself. Guns in the <br>  hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws<br>  affect only the law-abiding citizens.  <br>  Americans may want to take note before it's too late!<br>  <a href="http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunowners.org/hlr-au.htm</a> <br>  <br>  I have a story. In land far, far away where King Richard rules over all of the Land of Lincoln it was instituted that as of Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Two no one shalt have handguns in Chicago city limits....Since then it has been a city ordinance and the funny thing is Chicago just took over as city with the most murder in the US.<br>  <a href="http://cbs2chicago.com/local/murder.rate.Chicago.2.893791.html" rel="nofollow">http://cbs2chicago.com/local/murder.rate...</a><br>  <br>  If the UK had the same population as the US, it would be quite VIRTUALLY running rivers of blood!<br>  But, what the heck, let's take have a look as someone else's wisdom in the matter, which I'm sure >YOU'LL< be enamored of!!!<br>  —————<br>  Post # 177 {The UK 'gun ban' or GunShow is a CHRONIC LIAR}<br>  <br>  Via feedup<br>  <br>  USA population compared to UK<br>  <br>  300 million USA<br>  60 million UK<br>  <br>  Comparison of overall crime increase per million.

In the U.K. both are tightly controlled. There are fewer guns and less free speech in the U.K. For example Geert Wilders spoke freely in the U.S. on Fox News the other day but couldn't even get into the U.K.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	No, Americans can't legally drop in and buy an M4 or an Uzi. Automatic weapons have been very tightly controlled in the US since the 1930's, and in that time, there have been exactly two cases of legally owned automatic weapons being used in a crime, and one of those was by an off-duty police officer who would have had access to the weapon under other circumstances.Your impression of rampant automatic weapons use comes from TV and the movies, not exactly an accurate method of data collection.<br>  In comparison, Switzerland has an automatic weapon in two thirds of its homes, and they also have very little crime associated with guns. Likewise, Britain's gun crime rate has increased since the strict laws went into effect, so obviously you can't take the comparison directly; there are other factors at play, and the laws don't seem to affect the crime rates at all. What correlation there is may even be a negative one, there being some evidence suggesting that more liberal access to guns within a community decreases the violent crime rate.<br>  What's disturbing to Americans is that Europeans and Brits often look down their noses at us in a condescending fashion on this subject, when in fact, we seem to know a lot more about the subject than you.|`|fFq68dJYaa	As weird as it is, yes, more guns is the answer here. Your car can be just as a lethal weapon as a machine-gun - as it was clearly demonstrated on more then one occasion by Palestinian terrorists in Israel. Plus, not like absence of guns in open trade will stop criminals from getting them - there is always illegal market for that.<br>  <br>  As far as buying guns in supermarket - that's an exaggeration. They are sold in specialized places with background checks being a part of sale (what happened with that psycho in the university was precisely that in hi case, the background check was skipped).|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Woah there, let's insert some factual information into this discussion.<br>  <br>  There are currently over 25,000 gun control laws on the books in the US at this time. There is no "lack of gun control". What there is is a lack of enforcement of the gun control laws.<br>  <br>  Criminals are given a slap on the wrist, and sent back out onto the streets. Why, because the prisons are overcrowded with drug offenders. But that is a whole other debate.<br>  <br>  You can buy guns at WAL MART, but you must meet all of the gun ownership laws. There is a background check to confirm your age and identity. The background check is also supposed to stop convicted felons, and the mentally ill from purchasing guns. <br>  <br>  Many types of guns are already restricted. Contrary to what Hollywood would tell you, you can't buy a machine gun in the US today.<br>  <br>  Guns are not inherently evil. They are used in hunting and on farms and for protection much more often than for evil purposes. Better law enforcement, and training is the answer.|`|GHD8JicSaa	European nations were kingdoms and they still have the "subject" mentality.   They have no Bill of Rights to protect them from governments that control them.  <br>  <br>  The USA was born as a result of a civilian militia where we each grabbed our gun and went to fight the British.  As a result, it still has the Bill of Rights which limits what the government can do.<br>  <br>  And by the way,  Walmart is caving in to the Liberals and fewer and fewer of their stores sell guns.    <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The|`|dhs9QBMoaa	The right to bear arms was an essential part of early U.S. history, as the citizens of the new country never really knew if or when the British would come back to try and reconquer that part of the "New World".<br>  That threat has long been dead, but the culture of owning weapons and believing in self-protection has lived on.  Illegal guns and the violence they bring are negative off-shoots of the U.S. Second Amendment.|`|f845d6c34507a3a329369751bf5ef212aa	No it's not. Because in the U.K firearms are illegal it means that Police don't have to carry them. This increases the approachability of the Police Force and reduces crime and increases reported crimes. <br>  <br>  Even though you have clearly done research into this matter you have to realise the difference between the U.K's population and the U.S's.|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	Being trigger happy is a part of the American culture.  It's a part of their nature that has existed for many generations.  Getting Americans to give up guns is like getting Muslims to stop suicide bombings.|`|AA11469249	At one time I thought every American house had a gun. Then I found out that most Americans have never owned or wanted to own a gun. <br>  <br>  It is seems like rich people and poor people like guns - they buy them with burglar alarms and six packs.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Because, unlike the UK and Europe, it's written into the American Constitution.<br>  <br>  It's that simple.|`|0cpC40Mhaa	Gun control worked well for the Germans in the 1930's.  Oh wait...|`|eLaU52zLaa	Many EU countries with strict gun control have higher RATES of murder regardless of gun involvement or not. Many also have higher rates of violent crime such as robbery, burglary, and assault. <br>  <br>  I"n the US, 11,000 people are killed every year because of legally bought guns from places like WAL MART"<br>  You are dead wrong about this statement. More than 90% of all gun murders and other violent crime involving guns are from guns that were ILLEGALLY obtained, not bought at your local walmart or gun show. On top of that, hundreds of thousands of times a year there are lawful uses of firearms for self defense. You also cannot find a M4 or full auto Uzi at a regular gun dealer let alone a supermarket. To buy fully automatic weapons you need a special license which is pretty difficult to obtain.<br>  As for the Virginia Tech massacre, if the law we CURRENTLY have on the books, he would not have been able to purchase his guns at the stores he went to. Meaning that if his records of dangerous mental illness were submitted to the database then he would not have been able to get his hands on those weapons. But he was bent on killing a lot of people so he could have obtained guns through the black market which is the where illegal firearms used in crime are most abundant. If not guns, he could have used bombs instead and have claimed just as many lives, if not more.<br>  More guns are not a problem as long as they are in the hands of law abiding citizens. That is why our Second Amendment says we have a right to use firearms for lawful purposes and the right to own them too.|`|cIttXzrwaa	American citizens were intimidated by the voice of Charlton Heston.  They really thought he was Moses, you know.|`|N3OB7M8maa	Our Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives us the right to bear arms. The other countries you mention do not have that written into their constitution.<br>  <br>  Take Australia, for example. Just a few short years ago, the Aussie government confiscated the firearms from their law-abiding citizens. Since then, crime has risen, due to the fact that people cannot protect themselves now from those who want to do harm.<br>  <br>  If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Having laws against guns will not stop people from having them. <br>  <br>  I have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, and I exercize that priviledge, just to protect myself and my wife from anyone who would try to do us harm.<br>  <br>  There are many illegal drug laws, but we still have an overwhelming amount of illegal drugs in this country, and more coming in everyday. The same would happen if guns are outlawed.<br>  <br>  If our government tried to confiscate our guns, they would have to pry my dead fingers off mine.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be in a country where guns are legal, I recommend that you live in a country where they are illegal, and leave you unprotected from anyone who would try to break into your home, or otherwise try to harm you.<br>  <br>  I'm a patriotic American who served my country in uniform, protecting our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. Many men and women who served this great nation gave the ultimate sacrifice so that we could be free and enjoy all the rights that we have in this country. I don't want anyone, including you, socialists, communists, dictators, or anyone else for that matter, to try to trample our uninalienable rights afforded us by the Bill of Rights and the Constitution of the United States.
Hxttt7G0aa	I've noticed that anything about Bush went out, but they block or remove most negative about Obama. It's pretty obvious there is a liberal bias in the information that Yahoo allows to stay in the archives. Kind of a cleaning that has gone on in the media in general.<br>  <br>  Notice the liberal bloggers asking more and more if there are links to things which were totally public, like Clintons stealing of FBI files? As if it never happened if you can't Google it up? This is a clue that things are being sponged out of the record on that side, they usually telegraph those types of moves.|`|AA10202389	Just put up an internet address with any information.

But even if you did you would probably deny it anyway and still continue to seek other countries that rapes are going on in.  Why would you care for Muslim women anyway?  In one scenerio you discriminate people of the Muslim faith, in another you would like to help their women?  Then help their kids?  At the same time killing them in alarming numbers yearly in war (both women & children etc).  Oh, but I forgot, their dead don't really matter since it is known as a casualty of war.  Right?

It seems to make things worse when we try and intervene, and the poor women over there end up getting even tougher treatment as a display of defiance.<br>  <br>  I think we need to address this problem urgently, especially given the disturbing increase in child rapes.

But they were unable to sustain that freedom.  Also bear in mind that they do not all consider going without the veil a freedom.<br>  <br>  This just highlights the incompatibility of Western and Islamic cultures.  If there is to be change, it must come from Islamic women (and men) themselves.

HSLW9yftaa	It's a distraction to keep people from focusing on how incompetent Obama and his administration is.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	The Obama team is bereft of ideas. Their socialistic plans will cause more harm than do any good. Wall Street sees this which causes the market to plummet every time Obama opens his mouth. Since they have no constructive ideas and the effect of everything they do say only goes to produce even less confidence in the market and in the country they have no other choice than to point their fingers at something else and try to deflect attention away from their own failing which will soon mount even more. <br>  <br>  Bush did not point his finger at the clearly biased liberal press because he had class.

GOifC7i3aa	as long as a bruise would....perhaps a week|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Anywhere from 1 to about 10 days. Depends on how badly you were bruised under the skin. A suction applied to the skin which is large enough, literally ruptures capillaries under the skin like a bursting balloon causing you to bleed internally. In essence, you caused an aneurysm (sp?) to form and burst in many places, causing bleeding at the rupture points. It is NO different than any other bruise which damages blood vessels under the skin, like any bump which causes a "black and blue" mark. The end result is the same, blood cells free flowing into the tissue under the skin from ruptured blood vessels, very much like a tattoo, except this is red blood cells which are broken down and absorbed by the body instead of a permanent pigmented ink. You see the dark coloring because it is just under the surface and visible externally. The reason why I say 1 to 10 days is simply because of the amount of damage. Less damage, quicker healing, more damage, longer healing, which is only common sense. No matter what you hear, there is no remedy of any kind that will make the damage heal ANY faster than your body works naturally. Some people say, use toothpaste, rub it with a spoon, all kinds of other old wives tales, but NOTHING will make it heal any faster than ANY other bruise! It never ceases to amaze me how many times I have seen this same question answered here. Do a simple search and I'll bet you find a bunch of related questions from the one single word, hickey... Like I said though, the only remedy that actually works, as with ANY bruise, is TIME, time for the cellular damage to heal and the body to heal itself.|`|XGsuxRR2aa	Depends on how your body reacts to bruises, anywhere from 2 days to a week or so, on average..at least for me.<br>  <br>  Try taking more citrus to be resistant to bruises.|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	5 years|`|4CMx1uzXaa	About 5 days

0AlwfTxMaa	No, same situation here in the states.  De-regualtion from the 90's started this collapse.  It was a government mandate that banks make it easier for the lower class to get a home mortgage.  Pressure was put on them by the government to do this.  They did it, and then the poor saps couldn't or wouldn't pay on their mortgage that they never could afford anyway.

My son was ruthless from about 4..it was hard trying to explain thing in an appropriate way.<br>  <br>  When he was 5 he saw 2 men hugging each other in the street and the conversation ensued. He couldn't have been more underwhelmed if he tried. It helps that Capt Jack in Dr Who is gay as well....<br>  <br>  Also I am friends with two girls who were raised by a lesbian couple, my kids have never known them as anything other than a couple, they have never questioned it- just accept it.<br>  <br>  I dodn't teach my kids tolerance..I merely need to lead by example and show tolerance myself, that is the most potent way. Walk the walk ...|`|b8tgCAQJaa	The Daily Mail is toilet paper, I wouldn't trust it as far as I could throw it (which is not very far, as it tends to open out and the pages fall all over the place).<br>  <br>  If anyone even hints that non-heterosexual people exist, all of a sudden the Mail are outraged, like it's the gay mafia taking over or something. It's ridiculous (and ironic, considering the Mail employs probably the biggest closeted homosexual in journalism).|`|xcdHd7G0aa	I've never sat down and explained families with homosexual parents to them because it's never come up, but I have explained to them that sometimes men can have boyfriends or husbands and women can have girlfriends or wives. My eldest grasps it pretty well but my five year old still thinks boys kissing girls is gross and is determined he's going to marry me when he's older so he still has a bit of a way to go when it comes to understanding relationships! I do raise my kids to be tolerant of others regardless of sexuality, race or religion and I think it's extremely important.|`|XBy7am73aa	Yes why not, its so much more out there now. One of my best friends is a lesbian and my 9 yr old daughter has known they are girlfriends since she was 7, sex doesnt come into it at such a young age. Alot of celebrities too are in magazines etc, my daughter understands men can marry men and vice versa.  Educating children prevents ignorance. Its a big world out there and if we were more excepting as a society life would be alot easier for some people|`|kvm9MWdZaa	I let my children read all the crap magazines like Heat and Love It not because I think they are good but they do make them aware of all the things that they are not exposed to in our rather rural life style.  To be honest I think they know more about the "Modern Family" and its values than I do.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	I'm bisexual. I would teach them the basics of relationships and try to ensure they understood that being different is ok.<br>  <br>  Kids talk and playground myths about gay people are where we learn to hate. While I wouldn't want kids taught graphic things, I think a balance between reality and playground myth is a good thing.<br>  <br>  I understand that some parents might object. I did sex education at primary (not including anything about LGBT issues). Parents were given the option of not letting their children attend those lessons. 99% agreed to it.<br>  <br>  It seems easy to forget that kids turn into adults eventually.|`|RxZqP0cdaa	Hi Jo<br>  <br>  I am probably going to upset a few people (again Lol). However, I totally agree with removing the children from the lesson. I have no problem with children being informed that deviants from the normal man/woman relationship exist.<br>  I do not agree that it is right for the children to be taught that it is a natural relationship or a normal one.<br>  <br>  I do not care what these people do behind closed doors but watch out anyone who tries to force their beliefs down the throats of my kids.<br>  <br>  I do not believe that homosexual and lesbian couples should be allowed to adopt or foster. It is obvious that if an adopted child asks mummy why her partner is also of the same sex, then mummy is going to reply "because it is natural". The constant exposure to this will obviously convince a greater number of those children that they are probably lesbian or gay themselves (whether they were or not).<br>  <br>  And please dont get me started on the scottish lesbian couple who are suing the health service for not giving them IVF treatment.<br>  <br>  So in answer to your question, I shall try my utmost to reverse any teachings of acceptance that the schools may teach on tnis subject. I will make sure that  my kids accept that these people exist and that given the fact they keep it to  themselves then they are left to their own devices, yet I will also teach therm what reaction should be the norm if it is inten ded to have it rammed down their throat.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	i live in brighton which is supposedly the gay capital of england. and i would not say that that type of family is the norm, in fact its still rare, my son finished primary school last year and out of his year i can only think of one female-female couple, , however is there a traditional family any more? i think there are more single parents than there are husband/wife & 2 kids type families as there were in my day.  I dont want my kids to learn about this being an acceptable type of family i teach them to respect other peoples beliefs but not see it as normal, however, if when they are at such an age that they decide that they wish to follow this type of lifestyle well its up to them they will be adults and free to choose for themselves.|`|S8RL9lieaa	I'm the law where my children are concerned and what I say goes. If I don't want my children to grow up thinking that anything other than being normal is fine, that's what they'll do. Once they are of an age to take control of their lives they can do as they wish and putting me in prison for being normal might just misfire badly on the morons who suggest otherwise.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	I was too busy teaching them OUR family values, not someone elses.<br>  <br>  This story is absolutely ridiculous-to teach immorality in school.

Same with trade.|`|dKPFjQymaa	I really do not think we will be out of it any time soon.<br>  <br>  As for the USA, As it stands, with 600,000 job losses per month, even the stimulus would not help all that much.  This is going to be a nasty ride.  If we did not have a constant job loss ordeal per month, the stimulus might help us a lot.  But if we are loosing jobs, its digging a deeper hole to get out of.<br>  <br>  A good way to somehow control this mess is to Withdraw from wars, and build a stronger economy, keep tax dollars inside the country.  That is the first step to get out of this mess.  If unemployment continues at this rate, currently a little over 8 percent unemployment, well, it could very well be by the end of the year it can reach 20% unemployment which really means Depression.<br>  <br>  I know in UK people are also suffering big time with job losses, and their economy is also going downhill to an alarming level.  The euro is being affected big time.|`|t27SvIPbaa	When asking Western school children about the significance of Waterloo, the answer will be something along the lines of ‘the decisive battle between Napoleon and an English lead European coalition’. In fact, the future of the European continent was perceived to depend upon the battle of Waterloo. <br>  <br>  If Napoleon won, France would have been confirmed as the undisputed master of Europe. If Napoleon was beaten, England would have become the leading power in Europe and greatly expand its sphere of influence. <br>  <br>  What Western school children are not taught - for obvious reasons - is the much bigger story behind the official narrative, the story of one of the biggest frauds in human history. Nathan Rothschild, the head of the English branch of the Rothschild crime family, took advantage of his advance knowledge of the outcome of the battle by tricking the London Stock Exchange into believing that Napoleon had won. The resulting crash of the Exchange enabled Nathan Rothschild’s agents to buy the entire London stock market for a Penny in the Pound and seize control of the Bank of England.<br>  <br>  This shameless fraud was ruthlessly repeated in 1929. The private owners of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Rothschild subsidiaries J.P. Morgan, City Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank were awash with money earned by financing World War I. Using their market power, Rothschild’s agents first engineered an artificial boom in the stock market, tricking smaller banks and private investors into putting huge amounts of money into the stock market and then deliberately crashed it, enabling the Rothschild agents to buy most of the U.S. stock market. The ripple effect of the New York crash also enabled Rothschild agents in other countries, such as Germany, to buy local corporations at a fraction of their actual value.<br>  <br>  Eighty years later, it looks like our ruling psychopaths are at it again. They are systematically destroying trust in the U.S. dollar, causing holders of large amounts of green bags to sell them. At the same time, the Rothschild’s are preventing the European Central Bank from printing sufficient Euros for U.S. Dollar owners to exchange all of their holdings into Euros. That way Dollar owners are forced to buy gold instead, causing the gold price to explode.<br>  <br>  Simultaneously, the Rothschild’s are using their influence on the media sector to spread rumours of an imminent crash of the U.S. Dollar and international stock markets. As per usual, in the day and age of infowar, those rumours first started in the alternative Internet based media, only to spread into the mainstream business media. Last week’s ‘global stock and credit market warning’ of the Rothschild owned Royal Bank of Scotland means that the next Waterloo must be imminent. <br>  <br>  All it takes is a trigger such as a thwarted Israeli attack on Iran or the blocking of the Persian Gulf for oil transports, followed by a major stock sell-off by Rothschild agents. Once the world’s stock and credit markets have completely crashed, the price of an ounce of gold will be in the thousands, enabling the Rothschild’s and other owners of large gold holdings to buy the market for a fraction of their true value.<br>  <br>  <br>  (1)   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ZPGaGngJU " rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ZPGaGng...</a><br>  (2)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj9WCMk_tZ0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj9WCMk_t...</a><br>  (3)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSProh4FBEE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSProh4FB...</a><br>  (4)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CnZW9ZBiY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CnZW9ZB...</a><br>  (5)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYokW5WYXms" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYokW5WYX...</a><br>  (6)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGkDZPta-TE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGkDZPta-...</a><br>  (7)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv5Ip5z264" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPv5Ip5z2...</a><br>  (8)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7UzNwzOpLQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7UzNwzOp...</a><br>  (9) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk8pK7qZt8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apk8pK7qZ...</a><br>  (10)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3HYu4CcgU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3HYu4Cc...</a><br>  (|`|y4yKmqQLaa	What built America after the second world war was the good paying jobs and the union benefits  given.

But, that is just for the Uk Spain will go down because people wont be able to afford to go there. The UK will rebuild soon the retail and the tourism industrys will be on its up. The REst especially restaurants has got much more to come. <br>  The Building trade will take atleast 3 years to get back like it was especially when the banks rebuild.<br>  Especially with 2012 and the heathrow runway. We are going to improve immensely trading will soon be up. But, I think this could also be bad.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Why would anyone want to return to the way it was?<br>  <br>  <br>  The way it was consisted of unnecessary loans, enormous spending on credit cards, excessive mortgages, obsessions with property, consumerism, stock market recklessness financial fraud and greed, and government enabling.<br>  <br>  <br>  I say good riddance to it all.<br>  <br>  The economic crisis is a chance for a fresh start.<br>  <br>  A new better system should be put in its place.|`|dYGT38Cqaa	It may bottom in a year or two but it will not return to the way it was for a long long time....like 20+ years. Confidence has already been shaken too deeply. The market is controlled only by short sellers now because they know Obama isn't going to say or do anything to stabilize it. They keep hammering it down and Obama keeps making negative comments and sticking to the wealthy and certain industries with his policies. <br>  The Dow eventually has to have a dramatic rally because the shorts have to cover and when they do the buyers on the sidelines will pour in with a vengence. This can start any day now. The Dow will rally hard probably over a few weeks to about 8000-8500. But I don't think it will ever get back to 9000+ for YEARS. It will settle back down and trade around 6500-7500 for a long long time.<br>  This country is screwed and will get MUCH worse before it gets better...but that market rally can happen at any time now.|`|l20uJIuFaa	I'm afraid that things will get a lot worse in this country [UK] before they will get any better.  We need a new government in place, as this one have proved beyond a shadow of doubt, that they are not fit for purpose.|`|ezT7xruoaa	yeah things should return to the way they were before... in about 50 years! =)|`|nW3iJkT5aa	Recession hasn't hit home yet for the majority<br>  The one really feeling it at the moment are those made redundant<br>  . It will be hitting them hardest followed by threat of redundancy  to many more<br>  Some however haven't felt any impact yet  such as those in secure jobs & lower mortgages many of whom wonder what all the fuss is about<br>  It will only hit them once inflation gets underway which it surely will<br>  Spoke to one person recently who said "lets have more so called recession " because his mortgage has decreased by ￡400 per month|`|RxZqP0cdaa	Hi Mermaid<br>  <br>  Dont klnow if you  are in the uk or usa, however, from my point of view in the uk I would like to make one or two observations.<br>  <br>  Firstly, this recession does not affect me in any negative way.<br>  I do not have a huge mortgage on a property that had an inflated price, since the recession my monthly mortgage has dropped ￡55/month.<br>  <br>  I do not have a credit card and do not have loans or credit.<br>  <br>  I use my bank account to have my wages paid in to and then immediately draw them out.<br>  <br>  Food is geting cheaper<br>  <br>  Fuel for the car has dropped about 14p/ltr.<br>  <br>  Holidays are dirt cheap at the moment.<br>  <br>  The cost of a new car has dropped like a stone.<br>  <br>  Imported tobbacco is still plentiful and I dont drink.<br>  <br>  I see lots of ten bob millionaires now shopping at cost cutter stores and it gives me a warm glow all over to see them penny pinching.<br>  <br>  I do not know how long the recession will last. I do know that saving every penny you have is the best way to prolong the recession, the only way out of mit is for the general public to spend what cash they can and for the business community to turn that cash over.<br>  <br>  Anyone who claims that saving is the way forward (like the conservative party in the uk) have not got a clue about what is required to pull through.<br>  <br>  As for the recession itself, well I for one hope it lasts for a good deal longer, not only because | am benefitting from it, but also because I believe those who caused it should suffer far more than they have done up to now. That includes the Bankers, the investors, the shareholders and the hedge funds.<br>  <br>  Maybe then they will show a little respect for, and a lot less arrogance towards, the common working man.<br>  <br>  Thanks for letting me rant|`|AA11589988	I think within twelve months the banking crisis will be over and banks will feel confident about lending to sound businesses and credit worthy individuals. I think it will be a long time before we get into another credit boom - maybe it will be another ten years before poor people can afford to live much beyond their means. This will probably encourage more socialist kinds of government over the next ten years. I think the building trade will be okay because the government will encourage building projects to boost employment.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	2020 It will never be so frivolous again for a long time.There will be a return to the socialist--(govt involvement in industry)way of life The building trade will benefit from the govt building council houses and the stock market will languish in the doldrums waiting for a rogue wind to blow it aimlessly along|`|7d2ed527dde89c1fc1c143c96fcb64e7aa	I think anybody in the trades should diversify and build their skill in the areas of restoration and renovation of existing housing and office space.<br>  Their is such a glut caused by new construction on spec it is ridiculous and irresponsible.<br>  New tax penalties and rules should be levied on new construction until the crisis has passed.<br>  We need to stop protecting unions from the crisis as well. This shifts the burden to the more innovative parts of our economies both in the US and UK.<br>  We should be given tax breaks for investing. Paying taxes on interest, dividends or capital gains under 250 k should be abolished.<br>  Interest rates on credit cards should be fixed at no more than 10 % above prime. <br>  Tax breaks should be given to any company that can increase and sustain the number of employees it can provide jobs for over a 2 year period.<br>  Oh I could go on and the political garbage that is being shoved down our throats here is not making me feel any better.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	I believe with the leadership we have in there now things will only get worse.Sadly the days of good employment and low taxes are gone.

Both cases are used as exhibits for those who want gun control laws against the subjects of your government.

r8drw5Dcaa	We could only answer maybe, because no one knows, there have been successful experiment done with "embryonic  stem cells", but tissue rejection remains to be a problem.<br>  <br>  Adult stem cell would get it from the patients own body, no tissue rejection, but it's slower to replicate.<br>  <br>  I'm all for whatever works, people abort babies so why not use the tissue to save a life.<br>  <br>  If you can make a neutral donor stem cell then great, but it wouldn't matter where you get it from.<br>  Most likely they could extract it once and replicate it for eternity.|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	Yes.  They have made astronomical progress on scr in other countries around the world.|`|AA11898755	It absolutely will. Scientists will not have to waste research time, effort and dollars on trying to find a way just to create the stem cells, but will instead be able to focus on how to use the already available abundance of cell lines to target and attack diseases and disabilities directly. Until this change it was equivalent to trying to schedule an emergency trip on a supersonic jet by first building a copy of Wright brothers biplane.|`|3hAPLJ4Iaa	According to many scientists, yes.  The access of fresh, unused stem cells would greatly accelerate the research in many medical fields.  Allot of scientists have been chomping at the bit for this revokation.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	I would hope so, yes. I know they're doing some amazing things in China with stem cell therapies, but it's still very much at the experimental stage and only a few patients have benefitted from the treatment so far.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	Hopefully it will but it will take a long time.|`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	In the next few years, probably not.  Over the longer term, it's likely that stem cell discoveries will have dramatic effects in the treatment of numerous diseases as well as spinal cord injuries.  It will also probably benefit the US economy to have this research centered in the US, rather than foreign countries leading the way in this new industry.|`|cIttXzrwaa	I certainly hope so since my son is a paralyzed Veteran from Iraq.  They say that it has been too long for a chance for him to walk, but they are hopeful that he can regain his bowel and bladder function and that in itself will be tremendously helpful for him.  He can defecate without having to suppository himself and urinate without having to catheter himself.  To him, that would be like getting a miracle.|`|d29f5682f080f113ebb06c1d1e8e6cc9aa	I have nothing against stem cell research,  just embryonic stem cell research. Adult stem cells work just fine, even better then embryonic cells.
8cLV2OPYaa	A North Korea that is willing to nuke virtually their own land is by far the most dangerous regime we have EVER encountered. Do you think Germany would have nuked France in 1940 if they knew the hazards and consequences of using nuclear weapons? I don't think so. Do you think Russia would have nuked Georgia? Highly doubtful. Even Iran might take pause before nuking Israel I think, as I am sure they could have already done it if they REALLY wanted to, likewise with Israel. A nation that is willing to nuke their own neighbor is truly a dangerous regime, as they clearly have ZERO incentive not to use nuclear weapons.<br>  <br>  In light of the threat level that would be displayed by a nation that is so willing to risk not only their own health and safety but also of so many innocent civilians DEFINITELY needs to be wiped off the face of the Earth. We, however, have no need to fire nukes at North Korea. Our nukes serve only as a deterrent against other "civilized" nations that have many nuclear weapons like China or perhaps Russia who KNOW that we will only use them as a retaliatory strike against a nuclear assault. It is our way of keeping everyone "honest" so to speak.<br>  <br>   North Korea, however, is not impacted at all by the fact that we or anyone else is nuclear armed. They know that we cannot "politically" afford to use them against such a small nation that comparatively speaking offers such a slim threat profile. We can just as easily bomb them into the stone age using M.O.A.B.'s, or bunker busters, cruise missiles, and a whole host of other "conventional arms", without putting a single "boot" on the ground. After we turn the entire country into a burning ruin, South Korea can simply roll in with their million man army and a fleet of bulldozers and simply clean up the mess and re-unify their own country. Unlike the situation in Iraq, South Korea has at least a million men standing by right now to enter North Korea if necessary. South Korea is more than capable of rebuilding their own country without our assistance on the ground.<br>  <br>  People forget that North and South Korea are not 2 different countries. Korea is one country that is split down the middle ideologically and politically. They are, however, the same people. One people is west friendly and civilized, the other not so much. It makes no sense at all for us to put boots on the ground in a nation fighting a civil war. We CAN, however, use our air power in any way that ultimately serves our interests, and supports those that are allied with our beliefs. So we can assist South Korea adequately enough with our air power alone.|`|y4yKmqQLaa	hold our ears?|`|dYGT38Cqaa	We should get out of the way.<br>  We can't afford to do anything and any number of troops we have there will be like little sacrificial lambs. We can't fight a million man army right now. Why do we have to keep shedding blood to save other countries? South Korea has an extremely prosperous economy while the north is literally in the dark. Why can't the south defend themselves for a change????? The U.S. has to be everyone's big brother? I don't think so. Fvck that.
