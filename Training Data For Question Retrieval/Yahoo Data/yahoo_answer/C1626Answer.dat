dFzvfMZBaa	I live in Barcelona, in Spain. Barcelona is a really beautiful city. Beaches in Costa Brava are very beautiful, but I think that the best beaches here may be in the islands. In Illes Balears you'll find so pure water, and a very good weather. If you go to Ibiza (it's an island in Illes Balears), you'll find a lot of discos too. If you like that kind of atmosphere, you'll be in paradise. You can also visit Canary Islands, which are in the South of Spain. The weather there is tropica, because they're near Africa, and a lot of people go there in holidays. <br>  <br>  Here you have a video of Illes Balears: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgyKllQs34" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgyKllQs...</a><br>  And here a video of Canary Islands: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCB8pAzrDpM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCB8pAzrD...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck! ;)|`|D2GiPPjTaa	I live in North Spain, and Donostia is maybe the nicest beach in Spain, my oponion =)<br>  <br>  O.k I've seen Menorca, well Punta Prima was on that Video that is a GREAT Beach =)<br>  <br>  Canary Islands are nice, because they are HOT|`|KouAsdpyaa	In Spain the beaches near <br>  <br>  Conil de la Frontera - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yougodo.com/en/Spain/Andalucia/Conil-de-la-Frontera/information/L2519289.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.yougodo.com/en/Spain/Andaluci...</a> <br>  <br>  and Tarifa (a great place for wind/water sports) - <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yougodo.com/en/Spain/Andalucia/Tarifa/information/L2510599.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.yougodo.com/en/Spain/Andaluci...</a><br>  <br>  are both great beaches.

Lived in Spain.  Not a huge beach person, but if I have to, I'd like to explore the Northern Coast, and Costa de la Luz is much nicer, IMO than the more popular and wilder Mediterranean coast.  Never been to the beach in Italy.  <br>  <br>  For Spain, it is a must to go to Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Valencia has its attraction.  GRANADA is not to be missed!  And Toledo and Segovia are special and historic.  I LOOOOVE Ronda, a smaller town in Andalucía, and we really enjoyed Tarragona and Girona, for little towns that are lesser known.  I also want to explore the mountains, Navarra, Bilbao, and a couple of small towns in the central part of the country...but then, I'm a huge hispanista (fan of all things Spanish).<br>  <br>  For Italy...I have a dream of spending time in a villa in Tuscany!  But Florence, Venice, Rome, Naples and Pompeii, the Amalfi Coast, Cinqueterre and Milan...top spots in my opinion.  Most of that is common sense, and the rest is gleaned from travel shows and books.<br>  <br>  Capri and Sicily, too.<br>  <br>  And if you want a quieter beach, I'd check out the East coast...you never hear about that.  I think it would be where the natives go.  Just a guess. You might not hear about it because it's all rocky and useless.

oLhAi73caa	Ha ha, that's the first I've heard of "they only let gorgeous people in" <br>  <br>  London is full of many different cultures, which offers lots of opportunities to experience them. I've always found most people to be really nice after living in London for just over a year. There are always going to be stuck up and horrible people in a city, so you can't avoid it. If you ask somebody in the street for directions they'll most probably give you them along with a smile! <br>  <br>  The atmosphere is one thing i love about London, there are those days when everybody seems depressed (but I think that's me inflicting my emotions!) Head to places like Covent Garden, it'll be full of couples and families enjoying a show, little kids running around, people drinking pimms on the veranda and cute little cafes full of young women and men. <br>  <br>  This idea of only letting gorgeous people in is b****cks! You may head to various streets, like Oxford and Bond Street and see some fairly good looking but fabulously wealthy people, but there are very few! It's just one of those stereotypes of London. It may have been like that several hundred years ago, but not now. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped, <br>  <br>  Claire :D|`|xAlHgj8Raa	"only let gorgeous people in!" HA!

Split your $$ so that all of it can't be lost in one session.  Your hotel will  have a deposit safe that is free to use.  Some hotels have them in the rooms, others at the reception area.  <br>  <br>  You'll need cash for cab rides and the many tips you will give out.  Casinos on the strip require getting a "credits" card at the casino for use in machines and for chips.  Gambling downtown can be done with cash in the machines.

Everything in public hospitals is absolutely free. Outside of hospital, all doctor and specialist consultations, pathology and other medical services (not optical or dental) are heavily subsidised or in some cases, free of charge and patients have complete freedom of choice of which doctor or service they use. For people with chronic or serious conditions, annual safety nets are in place which further reduce the amount they must pay to a very small percentage of the actual charge.<br>  <br>  Pharmaceuticals are also heavily subsidised and the maximum charge for anything covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (which is everything most people need) is $32.90.<br>  <br>  Many people choose to also have private medical insurance so they can have treatment in private hospitals, but Medicare pays part of the costs in private hospitals and also subsidises private health insurance premiums. All private health insurers must operate on a 'community rating' system and must provide cover to anyone who wants it and at the same premium for everyone else with the same cover. Insurers cannot refuse cover or charge higher premiums because of medical conditions or prior claims history.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	AIN - Assistant in Nursing, 1 year TAFE part time, often trainees.

It's not a party place, and it's pricey as hell, but there's something about sitting in a giant leather chair, sipping on scotch and chomping on a good cigar. <br>  <br>  Other than that, you can always count on a party and at least one bachelorette bus pulling up to the 3rd Street stumble...McFadden's, the place next door that used to be Tiki Bob's and Finnegan's.|`|9d1cb04f2cf649a1dc6fdd65187045d5aa	jdm hit it with the obvious 3, Cheerleaders, Delilah's (top end, $$$) and Risque. I also recommend Risque or Cheerleaders over Delilahs. Also maybe goto Chickie & Pete's for some grub. Also consider Finnegans Wake if your under 30, or Mad River. Otherwise, you may feel a little old at those places.
CvMmhqktaa	Not bad at all. I would, as a precaution, carry your wallet, phone, or whatever you don't want to lose in your front pocket or carry on and keep it with you at all times. LAX also has its own police department and they are very much present. Your biggest problem will be the security/TSA check point. It is here that you will meet some of the stupidest and rudest people and it is slower than anything. When I fly out of LAX, I usually get there two hours ahead of time because the last time I showed up in the prescribed hour earlier I almost missed my flight.|`|6Gfz125Paa	I haven't heard of it being a problem in particular.

PCHyl9c9aa	very uncomfortable: firstly, you need to arrive super early to secure yourself a clean seat. Most of the time, someone else would have taken it before you board the plane. There is no staff (you have to bring your own food and drink), the one toilet is often out of order and on one of my many trips, the pilot was drunk.<br>  Oh, almost forgot, don't sit near a window: they're all broken.<br>  VOD? well, someone brought a tv set aboard once but it stopped working when the plane moved off the bridge: they'd forgotten to bring a long enough lead...|`|2e67b8d3381784e364cdb806560c9683aa	Any Air France flight is going to be wonderful.

The only variable that cannot be accounted for is the people, but that goes with any airline. Have a great trip.
LJkPRqN0aa	just think of how many people are envious of you that you live in spain, i would love to go there but i cant. popularity isnt everything you just need to be yourself and if you are happy with yourself then THAT is all that matters. you shouldnt have to change who you are to be liked. envy is a feeling and you can almost always control your feelings, you should think of all the stuff you do have and be thankful for that and not think of what you dont have.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	But is she happy.

The old San juan area is a must and if you are into nightlife that is the place to be, from there you can go to el Yunque Rainforest and for really nice beaches go to the small islands of Vieques or Culebra (that will involve taking a ferry). I’ll take time to go to the west side of the island for nice beaches and stunning sunsets (Rincon, Playa Combate, Bahia Sucia) While in the west a visit to the Bioluminescence bay is a must (Lajas town). From there you can explore the south side and visit a unique dry forest in the town of Guanica or perhaps visit the town of Ponce with its picturesque character.  If you like to see the green side of the island head to the center and stay in a “parador” like the one in the town of Jayuya (Gripi?as).

Otherwise I won't be a vacation. <br>  <br>  I would spend at least two days around San Juan. One day to visit the caves and maybe Ponce. And the rest at a cool beach area (could be either Vieques, Cabo Rojo or Rincon).<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Fu7E340yaa	You should try calling Venture Out Puerto Rico.

WPM0bqyBaa	It depends on when you go and your budget too. Italy is most expensive in August and early September, same as Spain. As for weather, besides the west side of Spain, the east side, Barcelona and the beaches around there only get hot at the end of June. I was there in the middle and it was still chilly. As for ITaly, for beaches, stay on the West side it is warmer and less windy. Italy is more expensive in general, lodging. Dining is the same price for both. The advantage of Italy is you really don't need a car if you stay above Naples. The train is cheap and abundant as long as you take it there, cause travel agents will scare you to take some before. Having said this, Italy has a lot of attractions packed within 2 hours of each other.. for example.. Florence is 2 hours away from Milan and Milan is 2 from Verona which is 2 hours from Venice or Bologna. Milan is 2 hrs away from Lake COmo and Verona is 2 hours from Lake Garda. FLorence is a 3 hr train ride from ROme and Rome is a 1.5 hr train ride from Naples.. very convenient. SPain on the other hand, Madrid, Seville and Barcelona are the main cities.. and all are far away.. so yes, Italy has more to see.. Spain is more relaxed.. Italy has more art, history and culture, the food is better... There are different types of beaches some with rock and some with sand in Italy.. I'd say Italy..|`|1uM9p96eaa	italy, without doubts!|`|oAOUXSJcaa	Both countries are worth-visiting. It is like when ones asks a child if he/she loves most his/her father or his/her mother.<br>  <br>  Italy is the country in the world with most work of arts and Spain and France share the 2 and 3th place practically ex-equo.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, Spain nowdays has a higher per capita income than Italy and you can see that when you compare the state of public places in both countries. Barcelona or Madrid are much more well kept than Rome or Milan.<br>  <br>  Spain is much more tolerant today than Italy. Spain is one of the few countries in the world where gay marriage is legal (and most people approve of it), something unthinkable in Italy nowadays.<br>  <br>  Night life is much better in Spain. This accounts for the fact that so many Italian young people goes to Spain only for fun, whereas Spanish go to Italy to visit their jewels like Rome, Venice and Florence.<br>  <br>  I think the choice is not so easy as many previous posts write above.|`|6EA2VKXnaa	Italy for me but ive heard spain is also very pretty.<br>  So yeah ITALY!|`|TyuZ06UCaa	by far Italy is my first choice.|`|GAdyo6v0aa	i'm italian then I say italy.

What restaurant do you recommend that is romantic, has good food and a great view? <br>  <br>  A: How about not one, but five? Top Of The World at the Stratosphere has a fabulous view of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas. Over the course of an hour, the restaurant revolves 360 degrees for a stunning view of the city. We recommend arriving early to have a drink at the bar or popping up to the outdoor observation deck while the sun goes down. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris has a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountains across the street. The restaurant serves French classics in an elegant atmosphere, and caviar is available. Another option is Paris' Mon Ami Gabi, which offers dining right on the Strip. Of course, if money is no object, take your love to the elegant Fleur de Lys at Mandalay Bay and dine among the thousands of rose petals adorning the walls. For spectacular interior and exterior views plus amazing food, enjoy Mix high atop the 64th floor at Mandalay Bay's THEhotel or Alizé at the Palms.|`|s7seaaPkaa	definatly take a ride on the gondola at Venetian hotel<br>  -maybe go to the spa i like the bath house at THE hotel.<br>  and ceasers palace are both very beautiful and get couples massages<br>  -if you like roller coasters you can go to the top of the stratosphere and go on thier rides!<br>  -go eat at the buffets like at the sahara its pretty cheap.|`|nZmLycrXaa	A spa is nice...anywhere you go.<br>  <br>  Tons of free entertainment on the strip w/ the Mirage volcano, Bellagio fountains, and TI pirate show.<br>  Maybe rent a car, eat, drink, shop....<br>  <br>  Great place to visit.

Tax is 20% and National Insurance 11%. so the stoppages are ￡77.05 leaving ￡152.15 to take home.<br>  <br>  So, the least any one has to spend a month is ￡659.31. <br>  <br>  If you gave your parents half of that towards your keep, in most areas you would be able to have a reasonably good social life. Even if you lived in London.<br>  <br>  However very few people are on as little as the minimum wage and most parents do not take more than ￡200 a month from their live at home children, unless they need to.<br>  <br>  It is only London and surrounding areas which have high housing costs. Other expenses are fairly similar throughout the country.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	If your parents fed you at mealtimes and didn't charge you board, I'd be surprised if you'd spend more than 300 a month. (I'm talking North East England here.) But it depends what you class as a "decent" lifestyle.<br>  <br>  ￡900 a month is absolutely insane if you're living with your folks, even by London standards. Most people who are working and paying rent/mortgage/bills do not have that amount of disposable income per month! If you're spending anywhere near that much, you're living the high life rather than just a "decent" lifestyle (clubbing every night and spending lots on booze, fashion and gadgets I expect), and should probably be paying your way instead of freeloading off your mum and dad.

7PMpJqiiaa	The Ritz is waaay far away and isolated if that is what you want.  It is way past Kaanapali, in Kapalua, a wealthy planned residential and golf community of windswept coastal plains and norfolk pine trees that will remind you of Pebble Beach in California, but not very tropical feeling if that is what you are looking for.  There is no shopping and no real beach here.  There is good snorkeling not too far away by car in Napili Bay, where you will have a good chance of seeing sea turtles, although you will see more at Turtle Town near Wailea.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure the Sheraton is right next door to the Westin on Kaanapali Beach.  I have stayed there, the Westin is nicer (was just upgraded a few years ago, you will like it) but the Sheraton is still great.  Are you trying to stay within a price bracket?  The Hyatt on the very end towards Lahaina is an amazing hotel.  These are all within walking distance of each other, probably wouldn't be worth changing.<br>  <br>  If you want a change from Kaanapali Beach, try one of the hotels on Wailea / Makena Beach (they are next to each other).  This is a more upscale area than Kaanapali and less crowded, but prices are higher.  The Grand Wailea is amazing, although there are so many competitors nearby now (Four Seasons for instance) they are all great.  There is great snorkeling over here off the Prince Hotel.<br>  <br>  If you REALLY want a change, you may want to consider taking the drive to Hana (you should spend a day and do this beautiful drive through the rain forest anyway) and staying in one of the tropical bungalows in this "south seas castaway" town, but this is really isolated, you really have to like staying in a jungle setting and hiking in the rain forest.<br>  <a href="http://www.hotelhanamaui.com/about_us.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotelhanamaui.com/about_us.ph...</a>|`|YhECDSKRaa	I have only stayed at the Sheraton.

All are qood hotels offering rates that are much cheaper than in DC proper.  I believe that each has free parking too.  Ballston also offers a major indoor shopping mall, and a variety of streetside restaurants, including several with outside seating during warm weather.<br>  <br>  Crime is not a significant problem in the Ballston area.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I live in Ballston, which is on the Orange line in Arlington, VA, and is a 15-minute Metro ride to downtown DC.

There is also the Capitol Hill Suites two blocks from the Capitol South Metro which is right next to the US Capitol and House office buildings|`|AA10702710	It all depends on how much you are willing to spend.  If money is no object, there is a hotel connected to the Pentagon City shopping mall...with access to the Metro station.  You never have to walk outside...just walk through the mall to the underground Metro station and you are one your way.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you are looking for an economical alternative, you can try the Van Dorn street metro.  There are some cheaper hotels nearby and they provide van service to the meto...which is about a half-mile from the hotels.|`|CugCzH9iaa	Crystal City has a metro and it is a nice area to stay in with several hotels, I stayed there last year.

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	We were already a multicultural society.<br>  <br>  Quite a lot of us have English, Scottish and French ancestors, some of us have Spanish, Portuguese and Moroccan ancestors - Irish trad music developed from melodies and techniques brought from Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, and Irish step-dancing developed along the same lines. Set-dancing developed from English and French settlers.<br>  <br>  Potatoes are vegetables that originated in South America and were introduced to Ireland by Sir Walter Raleigh.<br>  <br>  The great castles in Ireland were built by Normans, who were French. <br>  <br>  Quite a lot of people in West Limerick are descended from Germans from the Palatine region. <br>  <br>  Having grown up in Ireland in the 1980s, and found that various services did not match standards in other countries, I am glad that there are people from outside coming in and staying here - the quality of food and service in restaurants has improved so much overall because those people have raised the bar, and I'm pleased to see that Irish-born entrepreneurs have worked hard to meet and in many cases exceed those standards, which goes to show what we can achieve when challenged. <br>  <br>  We are not likely to become a mini-America. Well, we might if people are hostile to foreigners. Remember that the Americans we meet in Ireland are a small percentage of their nationality that actually travel abroad, and even fewer of them actually connect with the places they travel to.<br>  <br>  I love it that Ireland is multicultural. I hope it remains so.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Not to be rude, but Ireland still isn't all that multicultural in the modern sense. A few immigrant groups that have not been integrated doesn't really add up to multiculturalism.<br>  <br>  I don't think becoming like the UK or the US is a bad thing at all as they have made great strides in racial equality and civil rights, etc... Could someone like President Barack Obama even exist in Ireland at the moment? I don't think so. <br>  <br>  Societies grow or stagnate.

Having a degree from there kind of speaks for itself.  You won't have to qualify it.  <br>  <br>  Toronto is the business and banking capital of Canada.  As much as my husband and I would be willing to move elsewhere, there simply aren't enough opportunities for his particular specialty in brokerage, anywhere else in Canada.  If you plan to be involved in banking at all, you'll pretty much have to swim with the big fish.  (My husband, ironically enough, has a masters in Economics from York/Schulich since, at the time, that was the best choice for him.  Still, the reputation is that people go to York because they couldn't get into U of T.) (hehehe...suckers!)  ;-)<br>  <br>  I lived in London for a few years.  Western is kind of known as a party school.  Still, it's a respected university, and you really can't go wrong with a degree from there.  If you're at all worried about big city life, then maybe London is a better way to ease into it.  (Myself, I really hated London.  I found it painfully conservative and limiting.  Happily, it's only about a 2-hour drive from Toronto.)  :-)<br>  <br>  I guess, when it comes right down to it, you can't really go wrong with either.  I think a lot depends on what you want out of the university experience (Toronto is all business, and Western has a lot of social activities), and what others' views of degrees from each school are.  I mean, barring an excellent professor or field of study at one over the other, you'd want to go with the one that has the most respected degree in the marketplace.  ...Better for getting a job.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fawhiGtsaa	University of Western Ontario.

You must always enter Australia on your Australian passport - simply having one isn't enough.<br>  <br>  Because you were born in Australia before 20th August, 1986, you are an Australian citizen unless one parent was entitled to diplomatic privileges and immunities or was a consular officer of a foreign country.<br>  <br>  You will then be able to apply for your Australian passport.

VrX84IUHaa	Prior to recent changes to Skilled Worker applications, it wasn't uncommon to wait several years to completion.  Your friend could drive himself crazy second guessing exactly what the letter means!  It could be that they are notifying him that the application is now finally being processed by an officer/agent and this is his last chance to cancel the application with a full refund.<br>  <br>  His letter will have a client ID number near the top of the page and he can use that to look on E-Client on the CIC website.  Here is the link to access that section of the site...  <a href="https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=ecas&lang=en" rel="nofollow">https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=ec...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a link to frequently asked questions by Skilled Workers.. <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/faq/immigrate/skilled/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information...</a><br>  <br>  He could also phone the Call Centre and hope that they will give him some information - 1-888-242-2100 (if he happens to be on a visit to Canada as I don't think the number is accessible outside the country). <br>  <br>  Alternatively, he could try to email CIC through a contact address on the website. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to your friend!|`|2wyDALHgaa	To me it sounds like they are assuming he has abandoned his attempts to go through with the application or perhaps they had been waiting for additional documentation from him that they never received and they are willing to cancel his application and refund his money.  If they were going to process the application then they would have kept his money and gone through with it.  Also, if his application was rejected then they still would have taken the fee.  <br>  <br>  I'd have him contact the Embassy to find out why they are offering a refund.  I bet you will find that they have done nothing on his application due to it being incomplete and that is why they want to refund the money and dispose of the file.

You might try the website: www.bestplaces.net.  Not only will you be given an idea of relative housing costs and income, but this site rates other factors as well, such as crime rate, culture and schools.  Another site to check is www.jobmarket.nytimes.com.  It gives you tools to compare costs and pay in various U.S. cities.  When you narrow your search, it would be good to take a trip to your top 2 or 3 cities to get your impression, or "feel" of the place - something you can't learn online.  I hope you find just what you are looking for!

Pensacola Beach is one of my very favorite places to vacation.  You can go parasailing, rent seadoos, etc... options are limitless.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

They have to see your paperwork, such as your birth certificate, and you can't show a certified birth certificate over the internet.  It must also be signed by a parent or guardian, so they need to go in to get the permit with you, so unfortunately the internet isn't an option at this time.<br>  <br>  6/8/2007<br>  Description:  A "minor" is anyone under the age of 18. Prior to September 9, 1995, every minor was required to obtain an individual work permit, and each employer was also required to apply for a separate employment certificate for each minor hired. Minors 14 to 17 years old are no longer required to obtain work permits. In general, a minor must be at least 14 years old to work in non-agricultural employment in Oregon. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

Humans are imperfect, so you should logically expect that societies will be flawed as well. Research online is not the same as living someplace.

Once you are at a restuarant just talk to the waiter or waitress and make sure they dont add that chemical to your foods.  Im sure they have a wide selection of things to eat that are msg free.  When i was pregnant, i didnt eat alot of asian foods .
0fffe2e7ff7dc3c97a1c8297a89babd2aa	I live in Crete and i don't think you can go to the beach during April unless you are a winter swimmer. The weather may be warm and most of the time there will be sunshine but in my opinion the sea is still very cold.<br>  And to be clear, when we say the weather is worm during April in Crete we mean its nice to stay out and enjoy the sun but i wouldnt wear my bathing suit and go to the beach.<br>  I hope i helped!|`|a6p6zaYFaa	well my dad and mom grew up in Crete and they told me the weather there sometimes. Usually in April the weather is warm, like from 70 degrees to 80 degrees. Its usually always warm in Crete anyways.<br>  <br>  Ellas is right, even thought the air is warm the sea will still be cold, its because all the cold from the winter is still taking time to wear out, so everything cold drifts to the sea. then the warmth from the Sahara dessert will slowly drift into southern Europe and then eventually the Mediterranean sea will be warm enough to swim in again. At somewhere around late April and early May.|`|PYOn4jL2aa	YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Weather's in the 60s, 70s, and 80s
tvnyyzNXaa	Leicester is near Nottingham, about an hours drive and there's the space center there that is a good day out if thats what your interested in, there's also other museums and parks and things in Leicester (such as Bradgate park which had nice landscapes if you like walking), Nottignham and in Derbyshire (again around an hours drive) there is Dovedale national park =] <br>  <br>  For shopping there's the Victoria center in Nottigham, the new Highcross in Leicester and there's also a new shopping center in Derby, I forget what it's called.
f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Northern Ireland is a great place to visit. The people are friendly and there is a lot of history to absorb. Belfast, Derry and Giants Causeway are places you should definitely visit. I prefer the North myself as it is much less touristy than the Republic and is more of a real place. Belfast is a great city for music and nightlife. When you arrive, pick up one of those tourist guides like "Go Belfast" (free) that are at the airports and other places - everything is listed in there, clubs, restaurants, music venues, events, etc...The city is fairly easy to navigate - if you like take the tour bus around so that you get the lay of the land. If you are up for it, try to go hiking in the Sperrins - beautiful countryside up there. Have a good time!|`|wigtXCBTaa	Take a great deal of care about your personal security.|`|9CmMnxt0aa	Nothing, irish peoples understand English.

LBAh1tPoaa	Perth has a very high unemployment rate due to the downturn in the mining industry. If you are planning to work I would head for Sydney or Melbourne. There (like the rest of the world currently) is high unemployment everywhere, but the Western parts are the most affected. <br>  <br>  For picking work you will need to head further North.

MATiTs5Oaa	It is read in Arabic in the mosques, but good translations to Turkish are available everywhere, and many people prefer to read it in Turkish while praying alone.<br>  <br>  By the way, some of the people who answered are trolls, so don't take into account some of the weird answers and weird looking avatars.|`|oaaGhPnVaa	i dont read Quran|`|x79VCZsNaa	According to some scholar you should read the Quran in arabic because you get more blessings even if you do not understand what it says BUT to me this is just at the beguining if your mother tongue is not Arabic and you do not know arabic you should read Quran in your lenguage or one that you can speak and at the same time learn arabic so that you can understand what you are reading in arabic..why? because there are some lenguages in which Quran may be traslated in a way that the true esence of the meaning may be not close to the arabic one, so if you know arabic and you can understand what Quran says you can compare if the translation in your language is correct one..of course if you are interested it, if not you can learn to read Quran in arabic but read in your own lenguage that is most important to know really what you are reading not just repeating like a machine with out understand anithing...same as praying you should pray in arabic but if you do not know what are you saying then to me it does not have any sense.|`|ICvNW8OSaa	I'm not Muslim, although my boyfriend is.

mmWeBRRtaa	Since I live in the Bay Area, I haven't stayed at these hotels, but I can give some general advice.<br>  <br>  First, there are reviews of both hotels on TripAdvisor:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81375-Reviews-Sheraton_Fisherman_s_Wharf_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d119650-Reviews-Francisco_Bay_Inn-San_Francisco_California.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-...</a><br>  <br>  The Sheraton is a higher-class hotel, and also gets better ratings.  The Sheraton is ranked 86th out of 250 hotels in the city, while the Francisco Bay Inn is ranked 147th.<br>  <br>  Second, in terms of location, the Sheraton is definitely better.  It's very close to the Fisherman's Wharf area (which also includes the boat to Alcatraz, Pier 39, and Ghirardelli Square), and close to a cable-car line and the F streetcar which can take you to other interesting spots (Ferry Building, downtown, and the Castro).  The Francisco Bay is somewhat more out of the way.<br>  <br>  (Note that San Francisco is a relatively small city with good public transit, so you can get from anywhere to anywhere else without too much trouble; but the Sheraton is a little more convenient.)<br>  <br>  If money is an issue, the Francisco Bay is typically about $100 less a night.  Hotel prices can vary tremendously, however, depending on the season and on what bargains you can find.  The end of March is kind of an off-season for tourism (and could possibly still be chilly and rainy); and with the current bad economy, you should be able to find some bargains.<br>  <br>  If you want to broaden your search, you can look at TripAdvisor's ranking of hotels, and pick a top-rated one that matches your location preference and budget:<br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60713-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60713...</a><br>  <br>  Finally, note that the spots you mentioned are not near each other.  The Golden Gate bridge is somewhat far from Fisherman's Wharf (longer than most people want to walk), and Golden Gate Park is in another location altogether; so you can't find a place close to all three spots.  Of these three, only one of them (Fisherman's Wharf) is close to many hotels.  Another concentration of hotels is in the downtown and Union Square areas, and another along Lombard Street (including the Francisco Bay Inn).<br>  <br>  I'm a great fan of public transit in the city.  If you want to take public transit, you should pick up a Muni transit map when you arrive (and also a 3-day or 7-day Muni passport).  You can get them at various places, but one of the most dependable is the kiosk at the corner of Powell Street and Market Street, near the cable-car turnaround.  You can drive if you want, but parking can be expensive or difficult in most neighborhoods.
hVKYVJ89aa	you'll be absolultely fine, just try and clear your head and think about something else, or bring relaxing music with you, anything that calms you down or reminds you of something else. Just remember as soon you get off the flight you'll get to see your girlfriend and everything will be okay.|`|ow1PjXRjaa	Its totally normal since your flying for the first time. But 1000's of planes fly everyday and nothing goes wrong. It's only natural, your brain is telling you that it doesn’t make sense for a giant mental object to be floating in the sky, and your brain sees this as a danger. But of course we know that it is safe and hardly ever goes wrong. It's more safe then driving in your car, or being on a train, or even walking. <br>  Just try and relax when you get on the plane. It may shake about a bit at times, but its perfectly normal. Just have faith in the pilot and enjoy the ride.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	No,you shouldn't be worried. It's a million to one chance of anything happening.You'd win the lottery before you'd get in a plane crash.|`|R40lLWl3aa	Statistically, flying is the safest form of travel compared to trains and cars and whatever. <br>  <br>  Just relax, and if you think you will get too nervous, try talking to your doctor. I know my friend is terrified of flying and he takes a prescription medicine to calm him down.|`|rbMsaeJzaa	Hey!Everything will be okay.Just sit back and relax.Bring some music to listen to.Or bring a book.The flight its self is good,landing can be kinda scary but everything else is good.Just look for Arabs when you first get on a plane,if you see one....ask for a different flight!|`|8TwCi7Ggaa	For beginners, I would suggest you choose a seat that's far from the window. Bring your music and sleep throughout the flight. If you can chat with "veteran" passengers, that's good too. Pray and think of happy thoughts like "seeing her" for the first time and earning flight-points. :)

pcHp7Dgkaa	You don't lodge an application for Permanent Residency, but must qualify for and then lodge an application for an appropriate permanent visa. Your dependents must still be dependent upon you when you apply for the permanent visa or they cannot be included. If they are over 18, working and not enrolled full time in some form of education, they are unlikely to be accepted as being dependent.<br>  <br>  Exactly the same educational enrollment requirements apply to your dependents as to any other child in Australia. If they are below the school leaving age in your state, they must attend school full time but can work part time if they wish. If they are above school age and are enrolled in some form of tertiary education, again, they can work part time but in both cases, must meet all of the requirements for dependency.<br>  <br>  Once you have PR, your school age children must of course stay at school but any others are free to work or study as they wish and do not need to remain dependent.<br>  <br>  The following is a link to information about one of the permanent visas that you may qualify for - it requires employer sponsorship but others do not if you can pass the points test.

rXiSWrMBaa	Whether you choose Llangennith or Rhossili, it'll be the same beach.<br>  Llangennith is at the north end; Rhossili at the south.<br>  I'm not sure what sort of accommodation is in Rhossili. The Worm's Head Hotel may have accommodation, or it may be just a pub. Worth a try though. Also, there'll be B&B guest houses.<br>  At Llangennith there is Hillend holiday caravan site. This, I imagine, opens at Easter for the summer season. Probably B&Bs there, too.<br>  If you can get accommodation at Rhossili, that's where I'd stay as the views are far better, but be careful of the cliffs. Falling off a dune at Llangennith isn't as dangerous, of course. If you have the time, you can always walk along the beach from Rhossili to Llangennith (just a few miles) to see what that village is like.<br>  Getting from Swansea to either Llangennith or Rhossili means a bus. They don't run very frequently, but if you want the peace and quiet of Gower, that's not so important. The distance from the railway station to the bus station is a half-mile or so. As both villages are at the westernmost end of the Gower peninsula, a taxi might be expensive (about 12-15 miles, I think); but at least you can get one from right outside the railway station.<br>  If the weather is good, the P&Q will be wonderful. Remember, the Gower Peninsula was recognised in 1956 as Britain's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

QVuxRg9Haa	love is so essential .... you can as "flame" said love your family ... but we all do .. dont we ??  but ... to feel that somone cares for you .. protects you from the hate of the world by his love .. somone .. who makes you forget everything bothers  ... someone gives you a true smile when he sees you  .. not those fake ones you see everyday on everyones face ... then you would love everything as much as your lover loves you ..  but the problem is .. it became very rare to find someone you can really love|`|FEAua3dxaa	Love is essential to life.<br>  <br>  We weren't created to be alone and without love.  Love is part of our development and helps us to cope with stresses.<br>  <br>  This made me think about an experiment conducted by Harry Harlow to learn about contact comfort/love.  He created two mothers: one made out of wire but had a bottle of milk attached to it & one made out of soft terrycloth but didn't have any food.  Then he had young monkeys choose which mother they wanted.  The ones that were with the "wired-mother" with the bottle appeared to have psychological stress than the monkeys that were with the mother that was made out of soft terrycloth.  When the "terrycloth mother" was removed, the monkeys started screaming and crying, etc..  I'm not saying that we're monkeys, LOL, but he was trying to understand the effects with and without contact comfort/love.  Harlow thought that his experiments demonstrated that there are psychological and emotional stress and sometimes earlier death when there is love deprivation.|`|3N8T3q7Yaa	Love is more a desirable than essential<br>  Everyone is born with a desire to love and be loved but some loveS aren't essential............|`|ghMhb406aa	There's no doubt that love is essential to life..but not necessarily the romantic love..we can have family love ,friends love & so on..|`|AA11152480	yes we can live<br>  but live becomes better with it , although some times it could be more "bitter " also with it|`|ls7FeWoyaa	i think its essential because u a person needs to feel love or else they'll just feel like crap and suffer from depression and loneliness|`|0pM85b5Baa	Essentials of life doesn't include love, but to live as normal human we need love. <br>  <br>  Love is not always [male and female love] I mean all kinds of love. <br>  Even love of life itself.

SLFt8eHEaa	The answer above is correct in that it is a university college and so people that go there tend to be aged 18 and above.  As it's one of the top universities in the country you will need very good GCSEs, probably A*s to Bs, and as it's a university you will also need to have A levels to go there.

b1w5FUGzaa	1. What are the best routes to everything from fwd rooms? - they have elevators and stairs all over the place, gets a bit confusing at first but you learn quickly.<br>  <br>  2. I have a Deck 8 Promenade Room--How nice are they, what is included in the room, etc? - just like a hotel room, no iron though.  We brought our own !  I only saw the promenade rooms from the outside but to me it seems like those rooms would have to deal with noise all the time because the promenade was always full with folks.<br>  <br>  3. Do I have to purchase a juice card? What beverages are complimentary? - juice is free, if you want soda you have to purchase a card, but you can always purchase soda when you're on an island and bring it onto the ship with you !  You get milk and juice for free.  Specialty drinks can be ordered by any staff around the ship and cost differing amounts of money.<br>  <br>  4. What are some of the best onboard activities for me? - ice skating show, bingo, comedy shows.  <br>  <br>  5. Are there any good excursions that would be easy on my body? - the shopping excursions and city tour excursions.<br>  <br>  6. Do I need to inform anyone in particular of my pregnancy once onboard? - each cruise line has their own rules, you will have to look into that.<br>  <br>  7. How is the medical staff onboard?- they have a trained doc on board but cruise ships follow their own guidelines and rules and most of the time it's a foreign trained doc (95% of the staff is foreign trained, not saying it's a bad thing, just saying regulations are different for cruise ships so look into it, im sure they are capable  of handling situations !)<br>  <br>  10.

HWF5SnCdaa	There is nothing to worry about, flying is the safest way to travel today. In fact you are more likely to get into a car accident on the way to the airport than you are to crash. It is really quite simple what you do, the first answer was really really good but I will just sum it up a little shorter. After you get out of the car at the airport get your luggage out of the car (obviously) then you take it to the check in counter for whatever airline you are flying on, if you like to after check in you can hang around for a while or you can go directly to security it is your choice. After you go through security check to see what gat your plane is leaving from and if you have some time your can go to a store and grab a bag of chips or a bar or something for on the plane, you can go look through the giftshops or just grab something to eat. You may not bring any liquids on the plane as carry-ons so if you are bring lotion or some sort, tooth-past or mouthwash you must put them in your suit case, you also may not bring any of these and soft drinks or water through security. So after you are done doing what ever go to your gate and wait for the boarding call, when you get to the gate desk  give the person working there your information and papers and ID after you give it to her and she gives it back you can then get on the plane, you have the attendent your boarding pass on the plane and she will tell you where your seat is. So you sit there and wait for take off and you fly to Las Vegas get off the plane and follow the sings to the baggage claim, look for your flight number, go to that caroulsel and wait for it to come out. When your luggage when it comes out you can just leave the airport and be on your way. Have Fun In Las Vegas.<br>  <br>  PS: Buy me a tee shirt, I take a medium in mens.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Have no fear! The airport is a simple place. First, you should leave to the airport around 2 and a half hours before your flight if you are traveling within the US, and if you are going internationally, leave 3 hours before your departure time. You will pull up on to the ramp, and you will see signs that will have the names of airlines on them, for example, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, America West, Virgin America, and so on. Stop at the sign that has your airline listed on it. Walk inside with all of your luggage. Walk to the desk, and you will be told what to do by the agent. Give them all of the luggage you want to not carry-on to the plane. He or she will then give you are boarding pass, if you have not yet printed it online, and some baggage receipts, just in case your bags get lost. Then, proceed to the TSA Security, with your carry-on bag. Give the TSA Agent your ID and Boarding pass. They will sign the boarding pass, and give you both items back. They will tell you which line to go to. Put your carry-on bag into the X-ray, and remove your shoes, jacket, and any metal devices including a cell phone, rings, ear rings, belts, etc. Put them in a bin. Then, put them into the X-ray as well. A TSA Agent will tell you to walk under a metal detector X-ray. It will beep if you still have metal on you. If no metal is on you, you will be free to go. Retrieve your items at the end of the X-ray. Walk to your gate. For example, if your gate is B19, walk towards the sign that says, "To B Gates", or whatever your gate number is. Sit down, and wait until boarding. Boarding will be explained to the passengers before entering.<br>  <br>  Once you get to your destination airport, walk towards the sign that says, "Baggage Claim"; follow the other passengers if you are not sure where to go. There will be a carousel, and then once you see your bag(s), pull them off. Remember, it may take 10-20 minutes for bags to begin to arrive. Walk outside, and wait for the person picking you up. Good luck, and email me if you have any more questions.

kyEPS7xCaa	I am living in Hawaii (4yrs) and lived in LA/Anaheim area for 8 years. Born and raised in NY (18yrs), lived in St. Louis (1yr) and Japan (2yrs).<br>  <br>  By far, my favorite place to live was California.<br>  Now NY will always be my home, but I went to college, and spent most of my adult life in Cali, so that played a big part in it being my favorite.  I created relationships, good friends, lived the single 20's life there, and it was great.  I love the weather,and just the variety of everything.<br>  <br>  I think it really depends on your personality, but it's good to get out and see the world.  It really opens your mind, and see the world differently.<br>  <br>  Hawaii is nice weather wise, but if you are young, there isn't that much to do here.  I have a family now, so it's okay for me, but if I was in my 20's, I wouldn't like it, especially coming from LA.<br>  <br>  People are people wherever you go.  Some say Hawaii people are nicer, but that just isn't true.  People are nice everywhere.  People are rude everywhere.  <br>  <br>  One thing though, California, you will find a lot of flaky people, and Hawaii, you will find a lot of close minded people.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|oIkSKTTXaa	I am also twelve. I am currently living in Hawaii.

I think living in CA is MUCH better than Hawaii. HI is a fantastic vacation spot, but after about 3 weeks, you start to hate it. Theres 100% humidity all the time, mosquitos breeding in every drop of water on the ground, and (if youre white) its a pretty prejudiced place. CA atleast has temperature changes, and if you want to take a vacation, you dont have to pay for a plane ticket to go anywhere. Unless your family has the money enough to buy a ticket, you will hardly every see them in HI. HI's housing costs are INSANE too. Not to mention the gas prices. They are the highest average in the country every year. I knew many people who came to live in HI and after a year they had to move back because they didnt have any more money( in almost every job, the pay sucks) (and I was living on base, my dads in the army, so we didnt have a choice). HI's school system also has the second lowest in the country. When I lived in CA, I loved it there. Sure it has high gas prices, illegal immigrants, and its notorious for crime, but HI has the highest homelessness rate of any state, because the people born into poverty there can never get back on their feet, its impossible really. CA's living expenses are nothing compared to HI. And HI may sound like the dream place to live, but oce you do and see everything(theres not alot), it gets so boring. Even the beach does. After a month of going to the beach every weekend, I didnt go for 10 months.  Trust me, if I were you, I would start out in CA, then if you feel like you will die if you cant experience the joy (:{) of HI, then take a vacation.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	long term Ca is better, Hawaii is only good for the week that you are visiting.  Hollywood is in Ca and you can always be a movie star,,,not so in Hi.  the poster above me is right on!|`|tFj6N8Awaa	way better than hawaii!|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	I think you'll find that living in California is not all it's cracked up to be. The state is in a horrid amount of debt, it's crowded, and home and apartment prices are astronomically high. <br>  <br>  Sure the weather and climate are nice, but you won't have time to enjoy cause you'll have to work 3 jobs just to afford your one bedroom efficiency apartment. <br>  <br>  Just to live comfortably there you'll have to be making at least a six figure income.|`|YtCMjKV4aa	Kranch is right

Santa Fe is famous for their museums, I'm sure your hotels will have information. The Plaza area of Santa Fe and Old Town area of Albuquerque are where most tourists head to because of the architecture and history.<br>  <br>   Buffalo Thunder is a very nice new Hilton resort, about 5-10min north of Santa Fe; far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the SF tourist trap, but close enough to get back and forth quickly. It has beautiful scenery (awesome sunsets) and a golf course, if you're into that.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you're into such things, I believe they have at least one Indian-run casino in Albuquerque.

7Y2jmO7Taa	Probably somewhere in Midtown, tourists seem to like to stay there. But really, most hotels in Manhattan will be fun for a tourist. <br>  <br>  But don't drive here!

If you think traffic is a problem, parking in Manhattan is even worst.<br>  <br>  My advice, take train from DC to Penn Station New York, both Amtrak's Acela and Northeast Regional have direct train service between Union Station and Penn Station.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Native New Yorker|`|URO3gDXcaa	mid town.  parking rates will be extremely high.|`|tEDuNc71aa	if money isn't an issue, i'd go with the Mandarin Oriental at Columbus circle.

54f31ab3782d5867a302804aeea8499caa	Getting from Holland to Italy by train will take a long time,but if you get a sleeper on an overnight train,it could be done. Better to fly with one of the budget airlines,which will be much quicker and could also be cheaper if you find a bargain flight. Paris is very expensive,and do-able by train,but the idea of a 'home' base in Holland with such large distances to travel may be unworkable. Better to do something like Amsterdam-Paris-Venice-Amsterdam or whichever cities you like to visit than returning to Amsterdam after each one,since you have only two weeks. In the north of Italy,Rimini is the gem to visit. It is a wonderful place,and reachable easily by bus or train from Venice,or a very scenic drive. All the usual car-hire firms operate all over Europe...Hertz,Europcar,Rent-a-Car,etc. If you intend to use the trains a lot a Eurail pass will save you a lot of money. You have to get it before you leave home. Buy a pass that best suits what you intend to do. (see link). Allergy problems are well in the news in Europe,and you won't have any problems getting your requirements understood. All packaged foods have allergy information,especially if nuts are involved. English is widely spoken throughout Europe,and it's difficult sometimes to use a local language even if you know it because most people want to practice their English.....As for where to go,Europe is big,it has a awful lot of wonderful sights,and in twenty trips from UK I haven't seen one percent of it. Slovenia is totally beautiful,almost everyone speaks English,the food is lovely, the people are lovely,Lake Bled inland and Piran and Isola on the coast are real treasures.the capital,Ljubliana,is so sweet. It's small for a city,but it has everything. ..it's an absolute gem..  Crossing into Italy to Trieste gives you a lovely coastal rail journey to Venice,or go by ferry across the Bay of Venice direct from Slovenia. Trieste is worth seeing though......gorgeous.  You can't actually drive into Venice,all cars are left outside (even amphibious ones,haha).The train journey is very pleasant. Ravenna and Rimini are commuter territory into Venice,with lots of trains and buses,and are tops for beautiful Italian architecture and wonderful scenery. The Cathedral at Rimini is one of the top architectural wonders of Italy,and the reason for most people visiting.  A drive north from Rimini through Bologna,Verona,Bolzano,Innsbruck,would be verybeautiful and exhillarating,and there is a lovely train from Innsbruck through The Valley of the Inn,Bavaria,the Rhineland (it follows the Rhine for miles) to Hanover in the north of Germany,a beautiful city with a large lake (the Mashsee),loads of history connected to the British Royal Family through Prince August,the wonderful Herrenhausen,and when I lived there many years ago we even had square-dancing on the cobblestones around the Marktkirche (market church) every weekend. From Hanover there are easy connections by train,bus or air back to Holland. I used to do it every month for a couple of years......With a toddler in tow you won't want to be travelling every day. In Holland,Germany,Slovenia,and Italy,children are well catered for. Lovely playparks and childrens' amusements,and smiles all round.  Have a think about Paris....does it link well with the rest of your plans? Lovely to see,but socially it's a cold place. Some areas are OK.  Momatre is friendly. Central Paris isn't. It's a place to see the sights rather than to meet the locals. And it's expensive. However,it has that 'must-do' reputation,so a lot of people go there. There is an advantage in having very fast and cheap train connections from Paris to the south of France,(designed to claw some trade back from the airlines,and it did just that...) maybe stopping in Lyon or St. Ettienne (beautiful,both of them) for a day before travelling on to Marseilles, and you could get into Italy from there,passing swiftly through Monaco to avoid spending your life savings on a couple of coffees. Once in Italy, time constraints have to prevail. Rome is pretty far south and you definitely do not want to be in a car when you are there. It's bad enough for Italian visitors. A nightmare for the rest of us. There's plenty to see in the north,and seeing a few places at leisure is better than trying to cram everything in,especially with the little one coming with you. Innsbruck is much prettier than Rome,lovely for children,and the cakes are fantastic,even without nuts. There are egg-free alternatives as well. The scenery is awesome,and a day or two around Innsbruck will be a lot less stressfull than Rome. You won't have much time to stay in your friend's house if you want to do Italy and Paris. Days go by very quickly when you're travelling. If you have a couple of days at the beginning and end of your European adventure,you'll only have ten days of travelling around. Won't get much done with that,but enjoy it anyway. There are some lovely sights to see,and it's still worth doing. Best of luck.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You're not exactly down the road from Paris in the Netherlands, dear. And as for Italy - that's 500 or so miles away, at least.<br>  <br>  Have a bit of sense. Stay in the area, see what's in the Netherlands and don't be killing yourself travelling around. The Dutch Tourist board website is www.vvv.nl, and it is available in English. You are far less likely to have problems with your child's allergies in the Netherlands than in any other country because the Dutch speak English quite well.
URO3gDXcaa	most don't accept under 21.  i know of none that do.|`|MHNxYivzaa	I don't know of any that will check you in under 21 other than the days inn but it is not no nice hotel with room service or anything like that.<br>  sooo really depends on what you are looking for.
BhH9rYOTaa	The Washington Post provides a handy estimated metered taxi fare calculator (below).<br>  <br>  The fare for the estimated 6-minute trip would be $5.50 (without tip) in normal traffic; $4.75 as base fare; or $6.75 in heavy traffic.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	The trip will be fast--you could even walk it in about 15 minutes, all downhill.  Say a maximum of five minutes by taxi--probably closer to three minutes.  The fare system in DC is very confusing, as they change from a zone system to meters.  I'd guess you'll pay well less than $5 for the brief ride.
UE1evlTlaa	It is going to be pretty busy, just because that is the first week for a lot of spring breakers. But, there are ways to avoid the crowds.<br>  <br>  1) Go early in the am to the parks. Get there early and get on your favorite rides FIRST so that you will not have to wait in the awful lines later in the day.<br>  <br>  2) Get your tickets ahead of time. This is the number one mistake that alot of people make when coming to the parks. The lines at the front of the park to buy your tickets can be as bad as those within the park...so make sure to purchase your tickets ahead of time. PLUS, alot of times you can get your tickets at a discount if you purchase ahead of time. Look around online for discount ticket sites that are approved by the Better Business Bureau. I have used both DWTickets.com and OrlandoFunTickets.com in the past, and they were both extremely reliable and had great discount ticket prices. I know they have both Universal and Seaworld tickets. I think there is even a buy one day at Seaworld, get the second day free thing going on too!<br>  <br>  3) Look into purchasing the Universal Fast Pass Express pass. This is like the Disney Fastpass, but it must be purchased at the front gate. This pass will allow you to get into the Express line for the most popular rides in the park. Definitely worth it during times of high volume.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	You will most likely hit spring breakers by that time, so probably busy.

E3tDe43Maa	Join the club...there are thousands of people who have these same thoughts, but the reality is...  its not very easy to do.<br>  <br>  Considering the unemployment rate in Colombia is about 15% and the population here is very educated, with many people who hold bachelors and masters degrees unemployed....I'd say you shouldn't expect much if anything in the field of psychology. Especially if you don't speak Spanish all that well. Foreign language teaching is probably the easiest way to get a job here for foreigners, but you probably shouldn't expect to make more than about 2 million pesos a month. You can live on that, but it's not much.<br>  <br>  Maybe consider being a student if you can find a scholarship or other educational benefit that will help make it economically possible.|`|9uXeg1z2aa	I'm not sure about the psych degree but I would suggest seeing if there are any of those teaching abroad programs.

mT1WYaKhaa	You almost need a car in this city. The public transportation is a joke. Luckily your apartment complex is located in upper part of downtown Phoenix, so a job wont be as hard to find. I'm not sure what type of work you are into or qualified for, but my suggestion would be to send in some applications/resumes online for businesses located near your apartments. That way, when you come down here you can have interviews set up. There are a lot of businesses within walking distance from your apartments. <br>  <br>  As far as crime goes, downtown areas are usually pretty bad, with Phoenix being no exception. It is not horrible, but I don't know what your idea of crime is (where you come from). Phoenix has its pockets of bad areas, but for the most part your located in a descent area. The most you have to worry about is transients and druggies hanging around your area. <br>  <br>  I think you will find Phoenix enjoyable, but make an effort to get a vehicle. You will need it sooner or later to get around in this town. Phoenix is way too spread out, and waiting for public transportation will take up most of your day. Good luck!|`|1Mu14qcQaa	Phoenix is built  out rather than up compared to most cities. After all there's plenty of desert.<br>  <br>  Downtown does have a some high rises.

AA11937736	In a word, no. There is no part of French culture that is totally different than that of the USA.<br>  <br>  There are many things that are different but it is more a matter of degree rather than one of complete antithesis.<br>  <br>  This shouldn't be surprising since American culture follows the general patterns of Western Europe and France is a major part of that culture.<br>  <br>  Indeed, I think one reason Americans visiting France often seem more irritated by cultural differences (and are, in turn more irritating) is that we are so similar that differences in behavior seem to stand out so much more starkly and are more frequently subject to misinterpretation.<br>  <br>  An American traveling to New Guinea wouldn't much worry about trying to dress like a native (unless he's really looking forward to wearing a penis sheath and bone nose rings) but will obsess about "not looking like a tourist" when visiting Paris. <br>  <br>  The nuances of culture, such as personal space, muted versus bright colors, quiet versus high volume vocalization, smiling frequently or rarely, are small things amongst people who otherwise dress in roughly the same manner, eat the same sorts of food, listen to the same music, watch the same movies and TV, and have the same fundamental philosophical and religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to do an interesting little paper, how about one on pop music and the interchange between France and the USA? <br>  <br>  Did you know that there are a lot of popular American musical numbers that were originally written in France? <br>  <br>  "My Way" (Sinatra), "Yesterday when I was Young" (Roy Clark), and "Beyond the Sea" (Bobby Darin) for example, were originally, "Comme d'habitude" (Michel Sardou), "Hier Encore" (Charles Aznavour), and "La Mer" (Charles Trenet).<br>  <br>  You could talk about the career of Joe Dassin, one of France's biggest musical stars who was born in Brooklyn and educated at the University of Michigan. <br>  <br>  You could do a cute little presentation with videos from Youtube to illustrate.|`|10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	There are many aspects to culture that you could pick from even though, because of the progress made in communication and transport  in the last hundred years, the rapid evolution of the media, and world globalisation, differences between cultures are progressively being erroded. <br>  <br>  Food and eating habits are still quite different. Or you could pick a subject in areas  like classical or modern music, films, or art ( you could do a project on a specific French artist) that  are more individual . France has a variety of ancient castles (medieval/ renaissance /17th century), loads of magnificent cathedrals that were built in the Middle Ages. The scope of agriculture and farming is on a different scale altogether. The French dislike waste, are very keen on preserving the environment and do a lot of recycling. Sports or pastimes favoured in France are not all like in America.<br>  <br>  Christmas and New Year customs, festivities  etc...are different . There are festivals that take place in one country which are not observed in the other, for instance Thanksgiving Day does not exist in France.  French National day is on the 14th of July when special events are organised  with dancing and fireworks in the evening. Halloween, as a special day, only has entered French culture in very recent years and trick or treat does not take place, but the first of November (All Saints Day) is a holiday when most services shut down and families go to visit their family graves  and leave flowers there. <br>  <br>  If you look at these websites you might find a topic that grabs you particularly and you could develop it:<br>  <a href="http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/france-country-profile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resource...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.my-french-house.com/french-culture/" rel="nofollow">http://www.my-french-house.com/french-cu...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_France" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_...</a><br>  <a href="http://french.about.com/od/culture/French_Culture_Culture_franaise.htm" rel="nofollow">http://french.about.com/od/culture/Frenc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.french-property.com/reference/french-culture/" rel="nofollow">http://www.french-property.com/reference...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uqb7dkBbaa	Manners towards people, strangers.

62a782905683852221ca54bad3c08636aa	Chichen Itza and Uxmal are very different. Both are impressive and worth seeing.<br>  <br>  At Uxmal, you can not can no longer climb the famous Pyramid of the Magician (also know as the Adivino or Pyramid of the Dwarf). You can however climb the Great Pyramid. There is a good view of the site from there as well, the Governor's Palace is built on an elevated plane so even from there views of the site are impressive. You can also climb the south temple, it's higher, unrestored and overgrown so you'd want to be wearing pants and have some pretty serious bug spray if you did.<br>  <br>  Hard to describe both places but for me I find Uxmal more peaceful, (partly because it's less crowded) but also because the architecture lacks a lot of the war/human sacrifice images that are found a Chichen Itza. Both are very good though. You can't miss no mater what decide. If you go to Uxmal, you can also see the near by sites of Kabah, Sayil & Labna. If you are going to Chichen Itza from Cancun, try to see Ek Balam north of Valldolid as well.|`|AA10042296	No you can't climb El Castillo at Chichen Itza any more since an 80 year-old lady fell down the steps and died.  I believe you can still climb the Temple of the Dwarf at Uxmal.  The first link below is a map that shows all the Maya ruins on the Yucatan peninsula. There's a great view from the top of the Nohoch Mul pyramid at Coba (second link).  Ek Balam (third link) is a pretty neat site just north of the city of Vallodolid.  And Muyil (forth link) is a site just south of Tulum that most tourists don't get to.<br>  Those are my favorites.  You can search other names from the map in YouTube and see if anything else strikes your fancy.<br>  There's a small Villas Archeologicas Hotel at Coba and at Uxmal, but sometimes they are booked up with French and German tourists.|`|KdHshaX1aa	The inability to climb was definitely a disappointment at Chichen Itza. This was a recent change before we arrived - and we didn't know, so it was pretty disappointing. Having said that I would still recommend it highly.<br>  <br>  We were absolutely in awe of El Castillo, and the rest of the site was very impressive. It's fairly spread out, so there was some walking involved but it wasn't too bad. <br>  <br>  I wrote a review for <a href="http://www.thecanadiantraveler.ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecanadiantraveler.ca</a> on our experience at Chichen Itza and you can check it out in the resources below.|`|UW1FWRyhaa	Chichen Itza is way better, also is one of the 7 wonders of the world, the you can go to visit Mérida, Yucatán which is near Chichen Itza, and eat a lot of tipical food YUMMMM!<br>  That's my opinion.<br>  Sorry 4 my english.

This is the highest inhabited region in India and the River Indus with its tributaries, slice their way through the ranges. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Remote though it is, Ladakh has never been totally isolated. Over the centuries the trade route from India to central Asia passed through this area undeterred by its high passes and desert landscape. Caravans carrying spices, brocades, pearls, carpets and more mundane merchandise like salt and tea took just two months to cover the distance from Amritsar in the Punjab to the central Asian towns of Varkand and Khotan! Leh and Kargil on this ancient route developed then into centres of trade. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Buddhism & Monasteries In Ladakh :Though Leh has been capital of this region since the 17th century, strewn around it along the Indus valley are earlier capitals of he region. From Leh one can wander off on marvellous day expeditions to get a glimpse of some of the treasures of Ladakh. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Not far from Leh, Shey is the oldest capital of Ladakh from where its earliest Tibetan kings ruled. Perched on top of a huge rock are the royal palace and temples adorned with brilliantly coloured murals and a 7.5 metre gold statue of the Buddha. Basgo and Tingmosgang with their forts and palaces were also capitals of Ladakh. Stok Palace across the river from Leh is the home of the erstwhile royal family. The Palace Museum here has collections of beautiful royal costumes and jewellery, exquisite Thangkas, porcelain, jade, weapons and armour. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Kargil :The second largest town in Ladakh marks the mid point of the journey from Srinagar to Leh. Kargil is also the take off point for excursions into the Suru valley and the remote Zanskar Valley with their exciting opportunities for mountaineering, camping, river rafting and trekking trails into Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and the Indus valley. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Kargil was once at the cross roads of a network of trade routes that led to kashmir, Baltistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Tibet and an air of romance still lingers around its narrow cobbled streets and bazaars spilling over with locally crafted curios. The town retains its conservative Balti Shia Muslim culture and has two fine mosques built in the Turkish style. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Travel Facts of Ladakh : <br>  Altitude - Altitude range from 9,000 ft at Kargil to 25,170 ft at Saser Kangri in the Karakoram <br>  Temperature Summer - Upto 270C <br>  Temperature Winter - -200C and below in the higher reaches. <br>  Best Season - Early June to October. <br>  Clothing Summer - Light woollens <br>  Clothing Winter - Heavy woollens with wind proofing. <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   <br>  Leh - The Trans Himalayan Region<br>  Location - Jammu & Kashmir <br>  Altitude Range - 2,500 To 4,500m <br>  Main Attractions - Trekking, Mountaineering, Camping, Water Rafting, And Buddhist Monasteries <br>  Best Time To Visit - June To End September <br>  Trans Himalayan Regions - Ladakh, Leh, Zanskar, Lahaul & Spiti <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Leh is breathtaking. Towering over the city is the tall nine storeyed palace built by Ladakh’s ruler Sengge Namgyal in the early 17th century. It is said to have served as the model for the Potala palace in Lhasa. Another palace in Lhasa. Another palace built by King Tashi Namgyal in the 16th century stands above it on the Namgyal Tsemo peak. Down below, the town is a maze of little box like buildings bristling with brushwood stored on the roof for winter, set in an oasis of green fields.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Attractions In Leh : <br>  <br>  Within the town of Leh itself there is plenty to see and do. An easy walk away through the interesting coppersmith’s quarter, past the Moravian Church, the Ladakh Ecological Centre and across the fields, is the Sankar Gompa. Another interesting walk to the Ladakh Shanti Stupa goes through the picturesque village of Changspa. In the colourful bazaar are fascinating little shops with everything from semi precious stones - Lapiz, Coral, Turquoise and Pearls to fine curios and artefacts. It is a marvellous shopping experience. Skara another pretty village and the ramparts of the old Earthern Fort of Zorawar Singh makes another little expedition. Eating out is fun at open air garden and sidewalk restaurants that offer Tibetan, Indian and even Continental cuisine. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Buddhism & Monasteries In Leh : Though Leh has been capital of this region since the 17th century, strewn around it along the Indus valley are earlier capitals of he region.

Live music, cheap yard drinks, and a more laid back crowd looking to have fun.|`|UE1evlTlaa	PURE, TAO, Prive, Bank...those are my top picks :)<br>  <br>  Try to get your tickets ahead of time because these lines can wrap around the building. You can get your tickets on discount ticket sites or even from the nightclubs directly. Alot of them offer "front of the line" passes...where you don't have to wait and can get in. I would recommend those, for SURE! Don't want to waste your time outside the club when you could already be in!
pA64PtGLaa	Lodging in and around Many Glacier is both very limited, and very seasonal.  If the in-park options for Many Glacier (Many Glacier Hotel and Swiftcurrent Motor Inn) are either already booked or too expensive, you can look outside the park, but there are not many options.  Between Many Glacier and St Mary (about 30-45 minutes) there are a couple hotels/motels.  Closest is probably the Duck Lake Lodge, and then as you head south towards St Mary there are the Glacier Trailhead Cabins, as well as the Red Eagle Motel.  In St. Mary itself is the St Mary Lodge & Resort, and Johnson's.  I'm not sure price ranges off the top of my head, but they tend to go down the further from the park you get.  Keep in mind that most of these places are extremely seasonal, very few people live in this area during the winter months.  As a result, alot of these lodging options don't have alot of the luxuries some travelers are looking for, although some are more "rustic" than others.  Almost all of the very few amenities in the St Mary/Many Glacier area shut down by mid-September.  You could also head north to Canada, and stay in or around Waterton, but then you're pushing your hour or less limit.  There might be another place or two that I'm forgetting, but this is pretty much all you have to choose from.  I hope this helps!
UzPFTdUFaa	No you can't. Bristol is not on the route from Manchester to London.(London Euston to Manchester - Virgin Trains)<br>  Manchester Piccadilly to Bristol Temple Meads - Cross Country  Trains).<br>  You need two single tickets. Those bought for trains after 09-15am from London Euston, anytime weekends will be far cheaper than open singles/returns, and advance purchase tickets for specific trains cheaper still.<br>  www.virgintrains.co.uk<br>  www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	I very much doubt it because Bristol is not really on the route between the two.  You'd be better to ask them in advance.|`|qLp8pPkvaa	Better to just take a direct train to Bristol - Manchester is horrible and you will probably be shot!

About 750 miles, no tolls and all interstate highways.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Try Mapquest .com. They should be able to give you toll information.  I'd guess it to be in the $15.00 range overall, but my information may be outdated.
g05wGcPhaa	Moving isn't easy much less moving 2,800 miles across the United States. Since your 16 years old I'll raise the limit for you. $5000 would be the minimum amount saved up to even consider moving here. That could cover rent and basic necessities for about 3 months. The cheapest way of living would be with roommates/renting room. They usually rent out rooms for at around $450-$500 a month. The best place to look for roommates in the local area is on Craigslist (<a href="http://miami.craigslist.org/mdc/roo/" rel="nofollow">http://miami.craigslist.org/mdc/roo/</a> ). The big question is how will you support yourself when that $5000 runs out? Will a 16 year old employee even make enough money to support themselves if there only working part-time?<br>  <br>  As you may know the economy is in a severe recession and jobs are hard to come by and the unemployment rate is steadily rising and people are desperate to make ends meet. I'll just spill a little info over to you. <br>  <br>  As of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job especially in Miami Dade County. The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08 , higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.6%. So that means 752,000+ are jobless right now. In the tri-county area, Palm Beach County had the highest unemployment rate, with 7.8 percent, followed by Miami-Dade, with 7 percent, and Broward, with 6.8 percent. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position.<br>  <br>  A while ago Miami Dade County was hiring 35 Firefighters. More than a thousand (1,000) literally waited and camped out just to get that job. Out of those 1,000+ only 35 of them got the job.<br>  <br>  Recently in Davie, as many as 7,000 people showed up at a job fair opportunity, hoping for employment or any important lead. People stood in lines that stretched around parking lots and around corners, some even camped overnight just to be some of the first ones there the next morning. Now thats some serious stuff. That's how bad thing are right now.<br>  <br>  Tuesday and Wednesday (March 4th-5th) the Miami Dade College is hosting a mega job fair. Thousands of people wrapped around a block for a chance to get their resumes looked over by a potential employer from various industries. Hundreds if not thousands more are expected to show up. <br>  <br>  To get to the point. South Florida is a mess. Check back in 2 years when your 18 years old and you have enough money saved up and more knowledge of what you want to do in life.|`|bP2uylEfaa	good question, im trying to think about moving there <br>  i will drive to see other things too. i was wanting to live in miami for a long time because i think its a perfect place for me.
pgn2eSpwaa	you can try to see if they have phone service by using sites that Track reverse phone # directories<br>  <br>  but even google can give you info on that by plugging in their phone number in the search box (if it is not unlisted you will get the name & location on the phone account)<br>  <br>  best one I've found is Zaba where you can search their name & state, and it there are bunches with that name you can refine down to city
6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	The Disney hotels are very nice, clean, well maintained and top notch service. Plus guests of the hotels get early admission into the park, there is a shuttle service to and from the parks and you can have all your park purchases sent back to your room and if it's mid day, you are tired and need a break, the hotel is right there.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Yes, you can have your purchases sent back. <br>  <br>  The BEST hotel is the Grand Californian. Nothing beats it. You have your own entrance to California Adventure. Has an AMAZING pool area.<br>  <br>  Disneyland hotel is the original, but cannot beat the GC. Also a very cool themed pool area, but a bit further from the entrance.<br>  <br>  Paradise Pier. Clean, comfortable, Disney. It's OK.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to stay at a Disney property, check out the Howard Johnson and the Candy Cane Inn. Nice places, give you the most value, and you can walk to the entrance easily. Beware of some places that say they are across the street, but are over 1/2 mile from the entrance.
wzM5WB8Xaa	People will suggest a lot of different places based on where they have lived to you. Honestly, if you are looking for a place with a lot of work and great schools, I would suggest going west. Saskatchewan and Alberta (especially Saskatchewan) are still in a boom. They also have great public schools. Alberta and BC are gorgeous...they have the Rockies. If you are really looking out east, I like Ottawa better than Toronto. It is just such a nice city, and Toronto can be hell to get around in. Good luck with the move! Wherever you choose, I promise that you'll like us!

AA10975447	Here's a better idea: Take the 605N to the 210 West. It joins the 5 at the 14 junction. That way you circumvent a lot of the traffic on I5, especially through downtown. Leaving at 10am should be fine.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind coming back late, you can enjoy lunch up in SF, have dinner at Harris Ranch (I5 and Hwy198) then come back into LA. I see my family in Bakersfield a lot, and I often roll back into town around 10 or 11pm -- I'm just a few exits west of you on the 10.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It's a Thursday, no weekend traffic.  I'd worry more about the drive home than the drive there.  Of course you have to beat commuter traffic in the city, so I think 10am is fine.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	It all depends where you are coming from, but 10 AM is a good time to leave. You're going up I-5, right? That will cut 2 hours from the trip. You should be able to make it up there around 4 or 5 if you don't dilly-dally.<br>  <br>  If you are not in the south bay or OC, you should be able to leave whenever you like. The majority of traffic is going into downtown, so if you are starting in Glendale, for example, you won't hit any traffic at all. You can wave at all the cars going the OTHER way.<br>  <br>  Sunday is no big deal. You don't have huge traffic coming down I-5, so don't sweat it.
80bb2554281945b6ec92afe1970b26b2aa	It's kinda like "y'know" Ne.|`|B2jIiOwnaa	The other comments are right, but there are lots of other uses!  <br>  <br>  If it is said in a deep, drawn-out tone, it can be used to express agreement.  If you tell someone about a horrible experience you had, they might say, "Yokunakatta desu ne..." or "That IS bad."  Then the rest of the group might chime in with, "Nee..nee...nee," to express that they also sympathize or agree.<br>  <br>  You can also get someone's attention by saying "Ne!  Ne!", which is like going "Hey!  Hey!", but I suspect this will sound kind of annoying/childish and a form of butting-in in some situations.<br>  <br>  "Sou desu ne..." can mean "That is so," or "I see what you mean," OR if it is used in another tone, can even mean, "I'm thinking about what you said," or, "I kind of disagree...."<br>  <br>  If you're learning Japanese, don't worry though.  It sounds kind of hard to understand, but you'll get the hang of it the more contexts you expose yourself to!|`|X3dfHBGGaa	ne is something they say after a word to grab the person's attention<br>  it also means hey or "right"? As in that's expensive right or hey that's expensive|`|WhAKntgGaa	'Innit' or 'Isn't it'<br>  <br>  'That's right'.|`|QAzwbihFaa	its like a statement thats asking for you to say yes or no<br>  for example ii desu ne  would be isnt it good?<br>                   omoshiroi desu ne  would be isn't it interesting?|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Same as "eh?" here.|`|AA10662056	When you put ne at the end of a sentence and your tone goes up, it means that you are asking a question like "Isn't it?" in English.<br>  <br>  If you put it and your tone does not go up, you can just stress the sentence.

le0zdEmVaa	Hated it. The public transport is crap. I live in LA County now. The public transport is still crap compared to where I came from originally where subway trains and buses come every two minutes on the dot but Riverside is really crappier. You'll need a car if you don't want to spend half a day simply getting to and from places. Not much good restaurants or anything to do either. But the Tyler mall is getting increasing nice and as somebody said before the rent and housing is really cheap. And the sales tax isn't as high as places like LA.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It's ok, but definitely not one of the nicer areas of Riverside County (not one of the worst either, though).  Corona and Norco are much prettier, less congested, less smog, better schools - newer houses on larger lots;  or go south on the 15 towards Murrietta, Wildomar and Temecula for nicer areas too.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I think it's an armpit, honestly.

Parts of it are nice and clean. Parts of it are ghetto. But there's nothing great and outstanding about it. Really, it is just like my hometown, Bakersfield. <br>  <br>  If you need to live in SoCal, and you have a family and want a house with a yard, and you like shopping in strip malls with Big Box stores, then yes, Riverside will suit you well. I'm not really saying that perjoratively. Many people want the suburban kind of life. I've dated them.<br>  <br>  But if things like culture and nightlife matter to you, then you will die of boredom in Riverside.
ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	You won't need a heavy coat, that's for sure. It's "cold" here when it gets below 60. Bring all your shorts for the period from August-October. Just dress in layers, you don't need anything too heavy here. Not much more than a windbreaker.<br>  <br>  There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles<br>  <br>  For a number of reasons, we get a bunch of questions asking what it’s really like in Los Angeles.<br>  <br>  First of all, I'll tell you what it's NOT like: It's not like anything on TV.

There is a common misconception through out the country that California is warm all winter long.  NOT TRUE, we do have a noticeable winter, it just doesn't snow. Last night some areas in Los Angeles got down to the low 40"s, and the predicted high for today is in the low 60's.  November to March is our rainy season, although what we call rain would be considered just a heavy drizzle in other parts of the country. <br>  <br>  Bring the same basic items you would wear in Michigan except the things you would wear in the snow (boots, heavy coat, etc). Nothing in California is "cheap".  Los Angeles is the most expensive and highly taxed place in the country now.  Everything will be roughly 50% higher that it is in Michigan, so bring LOTS of money with you.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Bring whatever clothes you had in Michigan. Doesn't matter.

UE1evlTlaa	Ocean City was where we went for Senior Week Beach Week my Senior year of HS...only about 5 years ago now. And, that is still a really popular hot spot for teenagers. Also, another good one is actually Rehobeth and Bethany.<br>  <br>  These three are definitely good places for teenagers. There is a lot of do at night when it comes to the boardwalks. Also, there are even teen nights at alot of the local nightclubs, if that is the sort of thing you might be looking for.<br>  <br>  Ocean City is probably the BEST price/expense wise. And, Ocean City might have the most options when it comes to nightlife. So I would stick to the beach in MD/Northern North Carolina. Hope this helps :)|`|itXSUGVQaa	I agree; Ocean City, MD is probably the best.  However, Rehoboth Beach is also VERY nice!

They are overcrowded and have sand brought in from other places and it's just gross to me. Ocean City is worse than VA Beach (but Ocean City has a better boardwalk) but it is close proximity to Assateague and Chincoteague Islands which have beautiful beaches and wild ponies but tons of mosquitoes and no development. Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach in Delaware are nice, not sure about the nightlife there.
pcHp7Dgkaa	You don't need to work for a specific company unless they've sponsored you but if you have employer sponsorship, your visa will be processed as the highest priority and could be issued within weeks. <br>  <br>  The basic and most important requirement is that you have qualifications and experience in an occupation in which Australia needs workers. There are 3 lists of required occupations and which list your occupation is on will determine how long it will take to get a visa and also of course, how easy it will be to find employment once you're here. The most badly needed occupations are on the Critical Skills List (CSL):<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/critical-skills-list.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  Next is the Migrant Occupations in Demand List (MODL):<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/skilled-occupations/occupations-in-demand.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  Then there's the Skilled Occupations List (SOL).

mnIeK8q6aa	Yes, of course it has. It has also massively benefited the Thai economy, providing for the means to protect it. <br>  <br>  One has to strike a balance between protecting the environment and not overdoing it. No tourism at all is the best protection, right after no people at all. But that wouldn't solve anything at all, as people need a livelihood. Don't forget that a lot of encroachment in national parks is done by poor farmers who have nothing to do with the tourist industry.<br>  <br>  In general I think that protecting the environment usually is good for business. Using less soap or air-conditioning costs less money. Makes business sense. Same for not dumping raw sewage in the Bay of Siam. Tourists don't mind swimming in faeces (as they do in the Mediterranean) but they'd rather not.|`|YPHaQ1asaa	Tourist pay twice the price as a local to enter national parks and some tourist sites.  They say the money is to be used to help protect the environment.  I think the money goes in the pockets of the rich and famous here because you don't see them doing anything to protect the environment.  Trash everywhere and not a single trash can around and you see locals throws trash on the ground.

I found doing my hons degree i used stduy up until maybe 1 or 2 am and get up maybe 6.30-7. that way you have the best of both worlds. you get some sleep but also get some study. I found the morning, when you wake better to study because you may find you start nodding off or indeed start reading through things just to say you have them covered, but really your only glancing over them and saying to yourself i have them covered. I find taking small bullet points from each paragraph etc good. That way you can incorporate these vital pieces of information. Our lectures even told us that they look for important points and not a long life history story about the question. Also try not to worry about the exam once its over. Just try forget about it and dont go reviewing the paper, once its done its done. there is nothing more you can do, so chin up and move onto your next exam topic.

x79VCZsNaa	Years ago i was against death of penalty and almost all people in my country was because as every one has pointed out here no body has the right of take an others person's life..but in the last 10 years my country became a center of crime specially for kidnapping, right now no body is safe and it someone is kidnapped there is a 90% chance that criminals will torture and abuse him or her and then kill them in the most cruel way, the least thing they suffer is being mutilated from some of their organs.. and i can continue explaining several crimes but i would just say that thanks to our laws that have prohibited death of penalty since decades ago, Mexico became the second most insecure country in the world after Iraq), so right now several social organizations are proposing to stablish again that penalty, even they aplaud the sharia law that cut the hand of people for robbery (because even being assaulted has became a normal activity in big cities).. so i can not say that now i am againts because i have to be in the position of someone who has been on a kidnapping situation or being asaulted or abused and live the frustration that there is not enought law to punish that best.. other that death penalty.|`|FDjn05cNaa	I agree with you up to a point ....the trouble is that in many cases these creeps don't stay in jail for long enough & come out worse than they were when they went in !<br>  Jail in our country is like a country club with all amenities laid on & unfortunately even the worst offenders enjoy a level of lifestyle better that what they had on the outside.<br>  In my opinion , for really heinous crimes , people have forfeited their right to life & shouldn't be rewarded with a comfortable lifestyle at the expense of the society they abused .<br>  Society has rules in order that people can feel safe , secure .....those who break those rules should pay the price !|`|0j89XAmhaa	You stole my answer word for word, except for the word "againstit"<br>  <br>  I totally agree with your position, we have no right to dispose of people's lives, regardless.|`|ryk2VIOVaa	I'm against it|`|mLU18nIiaa	Assie should get best answer.|`|139RZ30caa	Yes, because it's cheaper.|`|9R8uYHcPaa	I agree with Aussie|`|m1JxtSVSaa	i'm against it and i agree with you
BKrVqOgiaa	Smarty, <br>  Yes, yes, yes, yes, and emphatically YES!<br>  I've been saying this for years.   Both are the product of religious zealotry (Zionism, in that "god" supposedly gave that land "to the Jews") and Manifest Destiny (in that "god" supposedly wanted North America to be white and Christian, from the Atlantic to the Pacific).<br>  As an American pagan, I don't allow religious mumbo-jumbo to cloud my ability to reason in such matters.   No one's "god" is in the real-estate business.<br>  And as an American of Native ancestry, I and most NAs closely identify with issues of betrayal, land theft, subjugation and occupation.<br>  Your statement is right on.|`|5oSnj1eTaa	Both of these concepts my friend have their origin in the human instinct for domination.<br>  There wasn't not even one case where the more powerful accepted the reason of the weaker.<br>  Maybe this "Globalization" theory is the cure for this disease, but I seriously doubt it.<br>  As far as your interesting example although these two cases seem irrelevant to one another at first glance, the main motive remains the same.<br>  So I might agree with you to a certain extent, only if the Jews would  remove that "God's will" false statement, of course.<br>  Greetings|`|pgAnh6f7aa	There are similarities but I wouldn't call it updated,more like atavistic.

Mxr6AIkiaa	You can check a duffle bag. I've done it many times, and so have lots of other people.<br>  <br>  Here's what Delta's website says:<br>  <br>  [quote]If your carry-on bag doesn't meet these size and weight restrictions it must be checked, and all checked baggage rules will apply. Your bag must:<br>  <br>  Weigh less than 40 pounds (18 kg). <br>  Not exceed 45 inches (length + width + height). <br>  Fit easily in our SizeCheck? unit (approximately 22"x14"x9"). <br>  Fit in an overhead bin or underneath the seat in front of you. [unquote]<br>  <br>  So technically, your duffle bag is oversize and theoretically you would have to check it. But in my experience (most of which I admit has not been with Delta) lots of people bring things bigger than that on board without difficulty. But be prepared for the possibility of having to check it.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Maximum size for a carry on is 45 linear inches meaning length + height + depth. Your bag would be 65 linear inches, so no you cannot carry your bag. You can check that bag though. It doesn't matter if it is a dufflebag, but it should be under 70 lbs. I traveled to Hawaii with a duffle bag and I had no problems. You can check snow skis or a guitar. I don't think they will have a problem with your bag. <br>  <br>  Be sure to check with your airline though as many have begun to charge for checked baggage. News reports have that carrier, Delta, charging $15.00 for the first bag checked. Call to verify or just be prepared to pay up to $25.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	No. Most airlines' baggage policy is that the length, the width, plus the height must not be above 55 inches.  So, you will have to check it for a $15 dollar fee.  You could bring a smaller bag and not have to pay the fee, and bring it onto the aircraft with you.  <br>    Here are the restrictions for carry on bags' dimensions on every flight:<br>      *  Weigh less than 40 pounds (18 kg).<br>      * Not exceed 45 inches (length + width + height).<br>      * Fit easily in our Size Check unit (approximately 22"x14"x9").<br>      * Fit in an overhead bin or underneath the seat in front of you.<br>  <br>  But, Delta's policy is 45 inches added up, so you can definitely not take it onboard.  Sorry.|`|2fYyw4LBaa	You can take a duffel bag as long as its within the size requirements... check another airline website to see their requirements they're all the same... but if you cant fit it in the overhead or under the seat you have to check it before your flight.  Your mom has no clue what she's talking about. You can bring any bag on the flight as long as its small enough... or else you can just check it. Its as simple as that.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	It looks like your bag is slightly too big to count as normal baggage.  The Delta website says you add the dimensions of your bag, and yours adds up to 65 inches but they say you can only have 62 inches.  If you use that bag, they will probably make you pay extra.  It's definitely too big to fit as a carry on.  (22x14x9).<br>  <br>  Can you borrow another bag from someone else?|`|MCiSrm2Vaa	call the airline|`|itXSUGVQaa	Per Delta's website, you can carry-on bags up to 22" x 14" x 9"; yours is significantly larger (unless it's only half full and you can compact it).  Even if they let you carry it, it would probably have to be gate-checked because you'll be on a small plane out of Louisville.  <br>  <br>  You can check duffel bags without issue.  However, don't put anything valuable/fragile in them because it WILL get tossed around.  Maybe only put clothing in it?|`|pG345I0laa	THIS IS THE REQUIREMENT FROM DELTA AIRLINES. YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK WITH YOUR CARRIER TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE THE SAME:<br>  <br>  If your carry-on bag doesn't meet these size and weight restrictions it must be checked, and all checked baggage rules will apply. Your bag must:<br>  <br>  Weigh less than 40 pounds (18 kg). <br>  Not exceed 45 inches (length + width + height). <br>  Fit easily in our SizeCheck? unit (approximately 22"x14"x9"). <br>  Fit in an overhead bin or underneath the seat in front of you. <br>   HOPE THIS HELPS.

ewd9n2lRaa	Everything is not ghetto in Atlanta.... obviously you have only been to 1 part of the city and apparently it isn't the good part.  There are lots of nice people and great places on the north side and in midtown.  If you can drive down to Peachtree City, Palmetto or Newnan, I'm sure that is less ghetto.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	If you feel like you have to say "I'm not racist" two times in a question then what you are saying is racist. I've lived in Georgia my whole life and around Athens which is about an hour from Atlanta. I think Atlanta is like any other big city that has all types of people living in it. If you hate it so much either move or don't travel there. You might also want to get over yourself!|`|4cb944f8f55b275bfaec54663513b740aa	I Agree with Heather, I dont know where your from, but Atlanta is a multicultural city. Not everyone looks and acts like you. Atlanta is a big place, you didnt mention what part of Atlanta (i assume you visited). Most of it is not ghetto, sounds like you have a personal problem.|`|ryS23sNBaa	yeah this is true. it is the availability of the workforce.  that is the population of atlanta.|`|AA12068233	Whenever someone says, “I’m not racist, but…” they’re almost always racist.<br>  <br>  Atlanta is above average insofar as large American cities. It’s culturally superior to Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, etc., but not as good as New York, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle. <br>  <br>  We all know when you say you want to choose your services from “non-ghetto people” you mean “white people.” As such, may I suggest you consider relocating to North Dakota.
pcHp7Dgkaa	I'm afraid that what you're studying for won't get you into Australia.<br>  <br>  Immigration visas are only available to people with qualifications and experience in occupations in which Australia has a shortage of workers. The basic list is called the Skilled Occupations List (SOL) and if your profession doesn't appear on there, you're simply not eligible for a work visa even if you have sponsorship by a relative. In order to have a chance of getting a visa in under several years, your occupation actually needs to be on one of the shortlists of most needed occupations and not only on the SOL. The other lists are the Critical Skills List (CSL) and the Migrant Occupations in Demand List (MODL). You must also have at least 1 year's experience though 3 or 4 is better.<br>  <br>  Here are the lists:<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/1121i.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/1121...</a> (the SOL)<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/critical-skills-list.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a> (the CSL)<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/skilled-occupations/occupations-in-demand.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a> (the MODL)<br>  The list for employer sponsorship is longer than any of the others and is at the back of this booklet.

I came from england too and I agree with you how lifestyle etc is bad, but still. if it weren't for your family here I would suggest maybe melbourne or sydney? <br>  <br>  and what living in perth is like....<br>  <br>  well<br>  the outdoorsy stuff is good<br>  but when it comes to shopping etc... its really bad.|`|iVferPLjaa	Perth's great.the only problem with perth is that when bands or celebrities or musicals come to australia they don't come to perth they come to every were ells like sydney and melbourne and brisbane but not to perth.|`|PeI5rpK1aa	I don't think you qualify. Things on the list are the ones we have a shortage of (nurses, teachers) <br>  As for Perth it's very pretty. Especially if you like the outdoorsy lifestyle because we have beautiful white sandy beaches(some of the best in the world), loads of bike paths etc and it's warm all year round. And it's pretty safe compared to Britain. People here are said to be some of the friendliest in the world and you'll never be waiting long if you brake down on the side of the road. And though it's worse than it used to be, traffic is rarely a problem.  It's like big city meets small town and we actually have a lot of English people here too. <br>  <br>  It's pretty safe here. But break ins are a problem in some places because the city is so spread out and there are thousands of acres of undeveloped land still. <br>  My dad moved here from the uk and he wants to move to Melbourne. He says " It's too bloody hot, and there's nothing to do, and there's no darn street lights anywhere. And look, the powerlines are still above ground!" He has a point. It's 37 degrees celsius (98 degrees fahrenheit) today and it's Autumn. In Summer the record is 44 (111 fahrenheit) Plus if you don't like outdoorsy stuff it's a bit boring. There are hardly any street lights and their excuse for not having the powerlines underground is "it might flood." Even though it's more likely to start raining fish than ever flood here. My dad also didn't mention in his little rant that the public transport system is shocking with busses only coming every half an hour and once an hour on weekends. We also have bugs. There are flies, mosquitos, cockroaches, bees, wasps, spiders (mostly daddylonglegs which are harmless but also redbacks, huntsmans and white tails) Plus the cane toads are slowly hopping over from Queensland(real pest, poisonous if touched, kill lots of pets and hospitalize children, introduced in 1930's to stop cane beetle but not able to jump high enough to eat them)<br>  I'd recommend Melbourne. There's more to do, better fashion, more people, and the weather is cooler so there are less bugs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.immigrate-to-a-new-life-in-perth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigrate-to-a-new-life-in-pe...</a>

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Unless you speak the local language, it's difficult to find work in any country. A person with the right language skills will always be chosen over a similar applicant without them.<br>  <br>  Also, within the EU, a company has to show that they couldn't find anyone locally to do the job. This means that you need exceptional skills in order to be hired, unless you can get a permit in another manner. A few fields are more likely than others, as they are in demand in most countries. These include qualified teaching, healthcare, engineering, sciences, some technology. If you are unskilled, in a generic career field, or don't have much education, you won't have much luck.<br>  <br>  If you have good contacts that can help you find work, it's easier. If you don't know anyone and just want to move over with a company sponsorship, it may be much more difficult. If you can find a US company with an Austrian branch, your best chance may be to get hired within the US and then ask for a transfer.|`|kgBPU4xxaa	There are very few available jobs for anyone in Europe right now. Companies are shedding jobs rather than adding them just like everywhere else in the world. EU citizens have the right to live and work within the EU, others require a visa that permits work. In order to get work you have to have skills or experience that can't be easily duplicated by someone from the EU. Here in Italy, for example, it's specifically against the law for an Italian family to hire an au pair from outside the EU because that doesn't require unavailable skills. I think they were getting swamped with visa applications that would clearly not get approved and passed the law to stem the tide of useless paperwork.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	if you don't speak german yes|`|j5nVMVPNaa	if you dont speak any german then yes|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	At this time, it's hard for anyone to find a job anywhere.
zy8mKJxeaa	Places on the inland side of the Napean Highway are less expensive than those closer to the beach. It is a great suburb about 35 minutes from the CBD. My son lives there and loves it. The schools in the area are excellent.|`|8cfvN5voaa	oh God i wish i could live in Mentone..those are so called "dream areas" that "normal" people could neve afford to buy a house in. Its amazignly beautiful. Nice beaches, nice leafy areas, great schools (my boss' daughter went to same Mentone school...) rich kids go there of course. although if you work in williamstown its pretty far... especially mornings.. oh god it would probably take over an hour.... have you thought about moving to willaimstown? again, beautiful RICH area....|`|AA10337460	I totally agree with Warren S, however Mentone is a bit far away from Williamstown. If I was you, I would look somewhere closer (e.g. Caulfield, Brighton, Elwood) as Mentone is nearly 50 minutes from Williamstown, without traffic.

A2u6G8Ooaa	You can say a lot of things about Rome and the Romans but my wife and I have only ever felt safe walking through the center of Rome - there is an unobtrusive police presence in most squares and touristy spots.<br>  <br>  Pack: 1) Most importantly a comfortable pair of walking shoes! Rome is a city you will want to walk a lot in.<br>           2) If you're going in Summer - plenty of sun protection, and a large hat.<br>           3) A little backpack for your maps, snacks, guide book<br>           4) A little water bottle. Rome has thousands of free drinking fountains - and yes the water in Rome is potable - and in fact due to its mineral content it's probably better than most bottled mineral waters.<br>  <br>  For shopping <a href="http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/shopping-in-rome-italy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/shopp...</a> should give you a better idea about the prime spots, brand shopping, local markets, etiquette etc.<br>  <br>  Restaurants are abundant so an intro into the food culture <a href="http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/rome-restaurants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.romanlife-romeitaly.com/rome-...</a> is a good start.<br>  <br>  Enjoy, you're going to love it, but like most things in life doing a little homework upfront means that you will reap the rewards later - so you're off to a good start by preparing like you're already doing!|`|Twzg9s0caa	It's very dirty and there is a ton of crime.<br>  Be careful.|`|4UIR1YuQaa	It's located on the knee cap of the boot.|`|dghOdy7Eaa	I live in Rome and I never had problems with crime.... I mean in all big cities you must be careful....no? EATING CHINESE in Italy ooo come on!!! there are a lot of restaurants in the center with fixed prices for the menu. for shopping try Via del corso, via frattina, via condotti and piazza di spagna they are all in the center and you can find stores with all kinds of prices from cheap to expensive and you can find McDonald's if you wish..|`|pS4e5OtZaa	I've never had a problem with crime. What you need to know about Rome (and all other European cities) is that they expect you to go to the bathroom someplace else - I guess in your hotel. If you need to use the bathroom go to McDonald's (there's no Starbuck's in Italy but that's another place to go elswhere in Europe).<br>  <br>  I always bring back a ton of coffee from Tazza d'Oro. It's right by the Pantheon.<br>  <br>  Take advantage of the Metro. Bring some comfortable shoes that are good for walking. Bring as much money as you can. Being there you can take your time. You won't need to see it all in 2 days.|`|FVfBm86Caa	you have to get some ice cream. and alo if you like chinese food go here MING YUAN, its on via barberini N.57. really cheap for rome and its good. watch out for beggers and pick pockets|`|WPM0bqyBaa	It's not dangerous at all, as long as you avoid services offered to you at Termini station. For eating, go where the locals go. Depending when you are going, always have 2 pairs of long pants and light jacket. Rome is usually warm after March. Pack the usual. There are nice stores everywhere, but try to visit Piazza Navona, Boca Della Verita, the Coliseum is a must, Vatican City, and enjoy the terrasses. Eating in Trastevere is good, lots of local hangouts there and nice neighborhood.|`|PInzNe7saa	if you're in a very large crowd (which is obviously hard to avoid in such a touristy area) make sure you're really aware of your surroundings. someone walked extremely closed to one of my friends and almost stole things out of their bag because it is such an overcrowded area that often times tourists are so absorbed in the sights that they aren't aware of other people around them. it seems really self explanatory, but a lot of the thieves over there thrive on the oblivion of tourists.<br>  <br>  also, avoid gypsies at all costs. they intentionally heckle tourists for money and such, and you really just need to ignore them and keep walking. sometimes they try to follow you and try to sell you things, but don't pay them any attention. if you do buy something from them, watch your money closely because even when you think you're paying attention they're really quick and can grab money right under your nose.
RA3p25Qoaa	I'm moving to Ottawa in May. A small Uhaul is about $800 to drive up so with gas and all the other expenses for travel it will be about $2000.<br>  <br>  It would be a lot cheaper to sell  the furniture you have here and buy new stuff when you get to Ottawa. Or only ship up the things you really really want while you're up there. A lot of people move to Ottawa for temporary work terms and their are lots of university students so finding gently used furniture shouldn't be too hard.|`|Twzg9s0caa	It might be cheaper to sell most of the stuff and buy new when you get your place in Ottawa.

UE1evlTlaa	I think you should be fine. We have been having a bit of a cold spell recently, but it is very on and off. Luckily for you, many of the pools in Orlando are heated, both at the hotels and within the water parks.<br>  <br>  In fact, I know that Aquatica actually heats their water to beat the outside temperature. It has an automated heater that gauges how warm the water should be within the pool water based on the outside temperature. They SAY that it is as warm or warmer than the South Seas. I went last year during their opening in February and it was FREEZING outside, but the water really was pleasantly WARM! Really warm! So, I don't think you will have anything to really worry about at the end of March. The water parks will actually be in full swing around then: Aquatica, Wet N Wild, Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, etc.!<br>  <br>  Try going later in the morning/middle of the day/early afternoon...these will be the warmer times for you!|`|9NpXU7D2aa	of course. <br>  temps will be around 79 degrees. <br>  you can swim pretty much all year round in orlando. <br>  and if you are staying on disney property even if there is a chilly day they heat their pools to 82 degrees so you will still be able to swim.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Many places have heated pools.
