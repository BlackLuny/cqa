Ho trovato la porta del passeggero della mia auto ammaccata e strisciata, quasi sicuramente da un'altra auto in fase di parcheggio...ma naturalmente niente biglietto con dati per contattarsi. Può essere considerato un atto vandalico e quindi il danno può essere coperto dall'assicurazione (essendone provvista)? Qualcuno ha suggerimenti o precedenti? Grazie a tutti

I just saw a Toyota Tundra commercial and it said they're the only truck that comes with headers from the factory, for extra power. I've always wondered, why don't the American automakers do this?? Headers would probably take even less metal to make, and they'd allow more power for the same or less gas. Why don't they?

20090131110236AAY2vRo	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I have a 2004 ford freestar, the drivers side air bag is blown, what do I need to do to replace it?	I bought a 2004 ford freestar that was involved in a minor accident, the van has been repaired and is in great condition but the drivers air bag had blown out when the accident happened.  I was told by the person that I bought it from, he would have to replace the air bag and replace the computer also!  I always thought the computer could be just reset.    what I can't figure out is that only the drivers side is blown, the passengers side is still good!  even though the van was hit on the passenger front corner. I found that kinda strange!  what can I do to have the air bag fixed?  the person I bought it from will pay to have them fixed, but he was going to get a air bag and a computer from a junk van to fix it.  I just cant see the need to replace the computer too. and also replacing the computer, will it work the same of will it leave some of the van's function not working?

20090131132057AAc1hPI	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does my truck suck?	I have a 95 Jimmy that's given me nothing but problems in the past. It's been doing well for the last 2-3 months, though.    However, last night it started acting up again. When I accelerate on the freeway to about 65, it tries to shift at 2.5 RPM. I don't change my speed at all, and it jiggles back and forth from 2.0 to 2.5 RPM and it rocks back and forth WHILE I'm driving.    It's not doing it nearly as bad as it used to, but the last time it did this, I had stopped at a stop sign and it pooped out on me. I couldn't get it to turn over.    My step father told me it had something to do with a carbon build up, and that letting it loose on the freeway would help clear it all out. He's usually good with vehicles, but he's been frustrated with the thing lately as well.    Also, as a normal occurrence, it shifts pretty hard on and off. It's an automatic, so it's reasonable for it to shift with a bit of difficulty, but it jerks both I and my passengers at times. Other times, it's completely fine and shifts with ease.     I know it's an old vehicle, and I should expect a few hiccups here and there, but this thing has left be stranded about 4 times now, and I've only had it less than a year.     I don't know if I'd just be better off trying to sell it and getting something newer and making payments...

20090131101720AAkfBqr	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Hyundai	Problems with a 03' Hyundai Accent?	Three problems are going on right now.      The first one is just annoying.  There is a constant "squeak" or "chirping from the left side of my engine.  I seriously can't figure it out and it is driving me batty.  I can't tell if something just needs to be tightened or what is going on.      The second is like the first, when I start up and back up my car it makes an annoying high pitched "squeal."  Then it almost immediately stops.  I would love to fix it as it's also pretty embarrassing.      The last problem is the hood latch wont pop anymore.  I can pull all I want on the lever, but it wont pop for the life of me.  I can go underneath and nothing will get it open.  I'd like to change my oil soon, but am out of luck for the most part until I can get into the engine compartment.      Any help would be great, thanks.
