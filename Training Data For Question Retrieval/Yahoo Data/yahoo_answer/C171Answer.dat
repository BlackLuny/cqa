im3vWyv6aa	Sounds like you are doing it perfectly. I started weening my babies off at 10 months old, by replacing a couple of day bottles with a sippy cup. (Which sounds like you are doing.) Then at 12 months when I switched to whole milk... no more bottles. I didn't have any big problems with the transition. In fact, my son, once I started him on a sippy cup he didn't want his bottle any more. We weened himself off at 10 months.<br>  <br>  Best wishes...<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Just slowly start giving him it less and less and if he likes warm milk at night give him a sippy cup with warm milk.  You can take him off the formula now and he will be fine.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	There is no real right or wrong time. My daughter still has bottles and she is 13 months but she also has sippy cups. She has a bottle first thing in the morning and when she wakes during the night. you do what makes you and your son feel comfortable. Don't let people tell you that your son should not be having bottles anymore because every baby is different and while one child may have been off the bottle since 8 months another baby might still be on the bottle until 24 months. Do what makes you comfortable. He is your son and you know what he is like.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Try replacing his bottle in the middle of the day with a sippy cup of formula. After he adjusts to that then go for the one in the morning and then finally the one at night. You can start now or wait until he is one but I personally would go ahead and do it now. Good luck!|`|0HICV1Tmaa	I would take him off.Or you could wait until his first birthday,and on the day just never give him another one.That's what I did,like the day before their first was the last day they had a bottle.It went pretty good,and they barely even noticed!
aYlXO4wCaa	Let her pursue her dreams and goals first before having kids. Kids are a handful and if she not ready then its okay. Understand her needs and wants too.<br>  <br>  I love my kids to death but if I had a chance to redo, I would at least graduate from college first then have kids. I wouldn't want to be uneducated and jobless with a house full of kids i can't support. That's just sad.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Then why did you send her to college?<br>  If GOD  decides you'll die without being a grandmother, then there is NOTHING absolutely 100% NOTHING you can do about it hon!<br>  If GOD decides HE will let you be a grandmother before you die, HE will see to it that you are.Trying to force her to have kids when she is not ready is wrong and selfish on your part.Ask the LORD to bless her with a good husband.An education for her is good in case something should happen to her husband, she won't have to be a beggar.|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	"Ganarexia" does not exist, it is not a country. <br>  <br>  Troll(?) let your child decide on her own when she is ready for children.|`|iO4YHFavaa	SHE DOESNT HAVE TO HAVE KIDS IF SHE DOESNT WANT TO <br>  IT IS HER CHOICE, AND THERE IS NO WAY SHE SHOULD TO DO TO MAKE U HAPPY.|`|1jcBMzVwaa	I don't know whether to laugh at your obvious stupidity, or cry with pity that you have nothing better to do with your time.<br>  Ganarexia.. is that down the coast from Moronopia?|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	well lets hope she wants an education, you obviously dont have one. Get over yourself its not about you!<br>  <br>  <br>  if she is educated she can get a better job to supprot her children if she wants them, and can come on Y!A and use correct spelling and grammer so she dosent look like such an idiot like her mother|`|UZKg2odzaa	i think that it is great that your child is getting an education. <br>  you should want that for her too, how is she supposed to raise a child when she has no money and no way to keep up her lifestyle? <br>  you should want what is best for your daughter.

My mother had my brother and sister a year apart and the had me 2 years later. I liked haveing my siblings close to my age, your into most of the same things and you become closer and hang out more.|`|ilZkHdKcaa	If you feel your ready go for it. I have three boys 25 monthes between the three of them. They were born oct 93 nov 94 dec 95. There is 13 monthes between the oldest and the middle and 11 monthes between the middle and the youngest. So when i gave birth to my youngest i had a newborn, a 11 month old and a 25 month old. I personally wouldnt of done it any other way. Being so close in age they share so much together. They really are best friends. You just have too put them on the same napping schedule.The only challenge I faced which really wasnt a challenge was showing them they are all loved equally. I used to and still do make special alone time with each one and 1 on 1 time with each one.|`|827b1a4a3523b8cb28a7e16e878732e6aa	Do what you feel is best for your family.

While we were in the process of adopting, I got pregnant. My two sons are 18 months apart, but they only arrived 7 weeks apart.<br>  <br>  They are now 2.5 and 1 year old. They are best friends.<br>  <br>  It was challenging at first, it still is, but it gets easier all the time as they become more independent. It was also expensive having two in diapers! As a parent of a 5 month old, you know the responsibilities involved. Only the two of you can decide if you are ready again.|`|GWveqx61aa	my sister whom is only 22 has 3, one was born than 8 months later she got preg agai and 3 months after delivering that one she got preg again,. she faces much diffuculties but not as many as she should, all 3 have diff dads, none of which care and then she lives with our mom, who takes care of the kids alot and i just dont think it was fair she cant do it by herself now everyone else raises the kids,, they only get worse too, the younger ones learn all the bad things from the bigger ones, im sorry but those kids are brats. now you are married and if you have the support from your husband i see no problem as long as you have this one under control, she has never had her kids under control, the reason you are not supposed to have them so close is so your body can heal. but if you feel gr8 go for it, good luck and baby dust to you|`|7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	I think you should enjoy taking care of small lil angel for now.

4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	You'll just have to continue to prove to them that you are a responsible young man by showing them in different ways. Eventually they will come around. If you want your parents to pay you, keep in mind they may not have extra money to give you for doing chores. I think kids should have chores without expecting a payment each week. Don't forget your parents are providing a roof over your head, food in your stomach and clothes on your back! Good luck proving your worth!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I agree with the person above me, a paper route would work for your age! Maybe even cutting the neighbors grass or shoveling snow!|`|p3d3E75oaa	lol 12 is too young sorry sweety but talk to your parents about a paper job|`|AA10475412	Only option is a paper route.|`|SpalD7Tsaa	Well first you have to take the babysitting course and tell them that your responsible and need the money since they'll say they will pay you an allowance but they never do. Don't work as hard. And tell them you'll only babysit kids let say from 7-11 that way there not too young but old enough to listen to what your saying.|`|vYgJMybeaa	A 12 year old is too young to be babysitting. I even babysat a 12 year old kid! <br>  <br>  If you're looking for money, get a newspaper delivery job.<br>  <br>  Why do you need money at age 12? Dont your parents provide you with basic needs?|`|WnbutJsuaa	try tutoring, u`ll get money and show your parents how smart u are!
UcgWrGaAaa	The placenta will work as long as you need it to.  <br>  <br>  I heard recently of a baby who was induced at 42 weeks and the nurses said it didn't show any signs of being that overdue.  My point is that if a baby stays in there that long there must be a reason.  That said, I serously doubt you will be one of those.  You really seem to be on top of things.<br>  <br>  The thing I have heard around here is that 41 weeks plus 1 day is the most typical time for a first timer to have her baby.  I'd say that would be a good day to take the castor oil.  Because with the castor oil you have to be ready, and by then I think you just need something to push you over the edge.  Remember everything happens for a reason.|`|2a2c24fc81bc910e984828a1ab26fd3daa	You might not have a choice if you go overdue, because if you go too far, you are putting your life and your baby's life at risk.  I wouldn't start worrying about it just yet though, but the placenta will not stop working until you give birth|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	What are you worried about when you are only 39 weeks + 1 day?  You haven't even near reached 42 weeks. To answer your question yes the placenta does start breaking away from the wall of the uterus as well as stops functioning properly. That is why Dr's induce no later than 42 weeks. My girlfriend was pregnant with a large baby boy and at 41 weeks refused to be induced ,she was adamant he would come on his own, but at 42 weeks she went into labour and he got stuck during delivery and they had to cut her in 4 places to get him out quick due to the fact that he was not breathing. The baby died twice and was revived twice, and my girlfriend ended up with stitches inside, outside and all around. The end result is that it's too early to tell if the baby has any mental difficulties due to his traumatic birth and my girlfriend had surgery last week to repair the wall of her bowel, cervix, and vagina from the damage caused by birth. If she had possibly taken the Dr's advice to be induced maybe this could have been prevented. Lots of women get induced just think if a Dr recommends it, it must mean it's necessary. Good luck..|`|tVqLmImUaa	Yes, there is always the danger that the baby will stop being nourished. The placenta has a shelf-life. That's why few doctors will let a labour go past 42 weeks. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about that at this stage, as you still have plenty of time. If it is your first baby, it is more likely to be a bit late. Stick to your guns and don't let the hospital pressure you into getting an induction.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	The placenta is an organ and it does start to die after a while. My doctor won't let you go past 42 weeks for that reason. Another concern with going too late is that there may not be enough amniotic fluid at that point. Your doctor will check that if you go more than a week over though. You've still got a while until then, so don't worry. Chances are you'll go before 42 weeks. Most women do. Good luck!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I don't know! I did find this forum though- one says 43 weeks or more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/antenatal-boards-522/antenatal-64/birth-labour-256/160860-when-does-placenta-stop-working.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.netmums.com/coffeehouse/anten...</a>|`|rFRo6DGTaa	I really haven't heard of it actually stop working, but I went 42 weeks and I had a huge baby 10lbs and 14oz, I though that she was so big because I was overdue but the doctors told me that actually usually after 40 weeks the baby will lose weight because they don't get as much nutrition. I'm really not sure what that means, maybe the placenta does not work as well as before 40 weeks, or maybe you don't eat as much as before because there's not that much room left.  I guess I'm not much help :) good luck.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	It begins to deteriate after 42 - 44 weeks.  (The timing is based on your date of ovulation and whether or not your due date is indeed correct.) Being induced really isn't all that bad, so don't worry about.  Your doctor would let you know if your baby was in any danger, and it's not uncommon to still be pregnant past 40 weeks.|`|XNJBHikHaa	I've read that after the normal gestation period of 40weeks the placenta starts to lose blood flow through to the baby.  Of course this just one of many reasons why they monitor you after a certain point in pregnancy and induce you when you go too far over!<br>  Everything will be fine... Doctors won't let anything happen to you or your baby!|`|plI0WOrUaa	When the baby is born, unless you have any problems.  No need to worry.  tell the dad that there is no experation date on the placenta lol!
IiML4zYpaa	It may be too late, but talk with your teachers. Ask if there's anyway you can bring them up because these subjects are really hard for you. Turn in all your homework!! Zero's can cause you so much. Even if you get problems wrong, it's better if you have that then a zero. Zero's will wreck your grades. I found that out in 7th grade and I almost failed english because my teacher lost my papers and gave me zero's! D: <br>  Good Luck(:|`|rNvXWMOMaa	get off the internet and study|`|TYxbaE4paa	Try to really get all your homework done and study.  Say you have a test on Thursday.  Try to study a little more every night and by Thursday you will have it down.  Also, you could ask your teachers for some help after class.  Talk to your parents explain to them whats going on.  Im sure they;ll be upset but they will only try to help you.  Im a freshmen in high school too.  I know what your going through.  I hate studying and homework but you really have no choice.<br>  Good Luck =]|`|4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	I really don't think there is any way to bring your grades up within a day! That is pretty ridiculous! Why would you wait until the last second anyway? You aren't going to change your grades if that is your attitude. I think that you need to stay off of the computer and turn off the tv and start opening your books before you have to repeat the 9th grade! Is a cell phone really worth all of that? Good luck with pulling up your grades!|`|9zwSclnLaa	Ask to do any make up work you might be missing, turn in the rest of your work on time that you do and maybe you can get them up by report cards.<br>  <br>  You really kind of screwed up I guess, a little late now.|`|AA11296427	...''Mom, dinner was great, i loved the pasta, and by the way ihave3F's, goodnight!''...<br>  <br>  <br>  :] LOL.<br>  <br>  <br>  No, really, just talk to them, and tell them that you'll try harder.|`|9hhxojfZaa	All the work that will be considered for your grades on Tuesday is most likely been calculated.  I think it is too late to get these grades up.  You probably should have thought about this weeks ago.  If you were so concerned about getting your phone back.  This seems like a case of too little, too late!  You really just need to do your work and pay attention in class, instead of thinking school is just one big socializing party.  stop screwing around with your friends in class, and pay attention to what's going on.  Pay attention to your teacher instead of your friends so much!|`|kcfZduJHaa	I'm sorry, but there is no way to raise your grade in three classes in two days. Just try harder for the rest of the year and maybe your parents will give you your phone back when your grades improve.|`|tcDtmzByaa	Just do your homework. I mean it's kind of late to do anything to raise 3 f's honestly. But just make sure you just start doing your homework for the next three years if you want to get into college!|`|nTQghH34aa	ask those teachers for extra credit, and if you can't get them up by mid terms you can always raise them by the time schhol is out for summer|`|zB2PIUmzaa	uuummm do ur homwork and try in class!
VZVGXRyraa	At 13, i think you're too young to wear it...i think you would be fine without it until 16. Maybe 18 is a little much but it's your mom's rules you have to follow..<br>  <br>  She's right though...make up can do some pretty bad things to your skin. You get pimples and then use more make up to cover it up and then just get more pimples. You most likely have perfect skin right now, take advantage.|`|p0prrzf2aa	fair. make up on young girls looks dumb. it WILL ruin your skin.|`|FGZR9RwDaa	no shes not. thats dumb. its just make up.|`|yvYQ85oiaa	Well you are only 13. You dont need makeup. The point of make up anyway is to cover minor "imperfections" and it is meant to look as if you are not wearing any.<br>  <br>  Your mom is right, and one day when you are older you will understand. She doesnt want you to be looking "slutty" or to be confused by one and Im sure you wouldnt want that either. A little bit of mascara is good. When I was your age though,  I would just curl my eyelashes with an eyelash curler. Maybe you can try that and see how you like it. <br>  <br>  XOXO|`|PJZRGsc3aa	ugh, girls usually look ugly with makeup|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	She's right about  not letting you wear it now, but I let my girls wear make up at age 16 so 18 is a little off.|`|Wy7oZGvZaa	she is right|`|pMmikgYVaa	I dont think you'll look slutty. I think shes being unfair and a lil over protective. Im 14 in highschool, I dont wear make up to school only to partys eye liner and everything, but if you want to wear it to school I think its okay but its better to wear it when your 15 or 16 because it really can mess up your skin; acne break outs, etc. Then you'll need to wear cover up and more each time cuz you keep breakin out more so wait a lil while and try to reason with your mom.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	If you can't tell a difference what's the point? Talk to her and try to come up with a middle ground. What does she feel is appropriate? Can she apply it so you know how much she will allow? Being mature about this will get you a lot farther. If she says no drop it and try again at a much later date.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	who knows.. maybe you're drop dead gorgeous and really don't need makeup.  i dunno, but i think she should at least let you try it and show her how you'd be wearing it..|`|AA11296427	You're 13.

But you have to listen to your Mom. You should talk with her and try to come to a compromise. Like, let her help you purchase the eyeliner, get her involved. do your makeup together. Sometimes parents have their own set of rules. Mine did. There is nothing more you can do, then to accept  her rules. You can even start a conversation with her about that. Find out why she feels that way about makeup.Once you open the line of communication with your parents, everything gets easier to talk to them about and you will have a relationship that is closer!|`|4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	I'd obey her for the rest of this school year and next year tell her you want to add something to your makeup collection. (like eyeshadow) She doesn't want you to look slutty. Keep in mind that you don't need lots of makeup to be beautiful. Natural beauty is all the rage these days. My boyfriend loves that my face does not change drastically after a shower or a good nights sleep. I think your mom will come around and not care about the makeup as you get older. Let it happen gradually, you don't want to break out with pimples from all that makeup anyway! Best wishes.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	make-up DOES damage your skin.<br>  <br>  i think you should be allowed to wear make-up whenever you're allowed to date. are you allowed to date yet?<br>  <br>  i'm 21 and i still don't wear make-up except for special occasions.<br>  <br>  EDIT: when you're 16 and get a job and can pay for it yourself, you DEFINITELY should be allowed to|`|7etbzVlBaa	I personally am not big on makeup and am not one to go around promoting it for younger kids, but that is a bit harsh. <br>  I would say that if she lets you wear mascara, do that for a bit and then gradually talk to her about it and first maybe ask about some light eye shadow and let her get used to that and so on.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	My mom used to be totally like that, but after a while she loosened up and i can wear whatever makeup i want [i'm 14]. i freaked out too when my mom said i couldnt wear much more than light eyeshadow and lipgloss until i'm 15 or 16 [this was when i was like 13]<br>  if you just be mature and don't bug her a ton about it, she'll probably loosen up soon and let you wear eyeliner and other stuff, even if it seems like she won't.<br>  <br>  eh i know how you feel. :/<br>  good luck!|`|DkT8znckaa	Yeah, I think she's being fair. I'm 13 and in 8th grade and my mom doesn't want me to wear any mascara at all. She's probably exaggerating about the 18 thing. (It's like when your parents say "You can't date until you're 40!") If she's already letting you wear mascara, she'll probably let you wear other stuff too by the time you are around 14-16.|`|TYxbaE4paa	Yeah, i think that is a little unfair.  And if it's only a little bit of make up you want to wear for a change thats not looking slutty.  But I think your mom just is afraid you'll put alot of it on.  Also, your only 13 and she's just being a mom. But until your 18..that is really unfair.  Just talk to her.<br>  Good Luck =]|`|c4BxyRzbaa	My mom was exactly the same, but now im 11th grade and my mom does not care anymore. I will say she is right about the make up damaging your skin, not so much eye liner but things like foundation will. Trust me, some of my friends parents did not care and you should see wat they look like now without there makeup. So just give it time and she will come around.|`|9hhxojfZaa	I think she is being totally fair.You have plenty of time to wear make-up when you are older.  Make-up is bad for the skin.  It clogs your pores and actually can cause acne (zits).  At my school, most of the girls that wear make-up, do look slutty!  Parents do know a few things about life, and are only looking out for their children's best interest.|`|zB2PIUmzaa	i think she is being fair but does she know that its only eyeliner? bc if she doesnt then tell her! and my mom doesnt let me where make-up but sometimes i do anyway like maybe u can go to the store buy some and then put it on at school! thats wat i would do and i think i have done that b4 so yah! have fun! hope i helped!|`|stD8Dbn1aa	Ok I was wearing eyeliner when I was 12.

In my opinion makeup doesnt make a girl look slutty if you do it right. I mean if you wear piles and piles and make your eye so extremly dark then thats a different story but if you only wear a little and it looks good then it is fine, maybe one day you should show your mom what you would look like with it on and if you wear a resinable amout she will probably let you<br>  hope i help<br>  =]]<br>  by the way im also im 8th grade and i have been wearing make since sixth grade.<br>  =]]|`|6crnT1enaa	I don't think 18 is fair.

1VOsRV8Maa	I took my baby on a 1500 mile road trip when he was 3 weeks old to my brother's wedding. The traveling made him terribly gassy, and he was the crabbiest he's ever been. My brother's mother in law rubbed a little peppermint oil on my son's FEET and put socks on him. Not too much because it can be ingested through the blood stream on his feet, but he literally stopped crying and let out a TON of gas about 3 minutes after she put the oil on him! I've never tried around the belly button, but I'll swear by it on his feet! Good luck!
2n0vR0OMaa	I work at a daycare, tell the teachers you are toilet training and they will remind and take your girl to the toilet. Often children pick up the concept quickly because they can see the older ones .<br>  Your girl if ready will cotton on pretty quickly so will be able to use grandmothers toilet. Just make sure she knows where it is- have a potty round there! <br>  Keep consistent with your girl at home- sitting her on the toilet esp after meals/drinks and praising heaps when she manages something.<br>  Go out and choose "big girl knickers" together. If she has frequent accidents just say ?h you aren't ready yet and go back to nappies.No stress they all get there!|`|YBzZ5Bgraa	Well, I work at a daycare and we actually do potty - training. You should find out if your daycare does, and if they don't, consider switching. You'll have to find a way to make the Grandma understand. Your child can't be using the big boy toilet some days, and his diaper the other days. It will only confuse him.

FEg0PDdnaa	If they check the hcg they can have an idea of how far along you are but I don't think they can be positive.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	Yes :P|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I don't believe they can tell from a urine test. The urinte and blood test just tells you how much of the pregnancy hormone is in there. They usually determine the due date by when your last period was and the size of the baby in the ultrasound. Good Luck & God Bless oh and CONGRATS :)|`|AA12395149	Urine test tells them whether or not your pregnant.  The blood test actually measures the amount of HCG, certain levels can approximate how far along you are.  Typically they determine how far along you are by the first day of your last period.  If this is unknown, they may do an early ultrasound.  Babies typically grow at the same rate the first 10 weeks, so an ultrasound before that is pretty accurate for dating.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	more likely from the blood work,i was told lower hcg levels are early in pregnancy and they increase everyday....the earlier you are the lower they are...granted everything is ok with baby....if there is something wrong with the pregnancy you will have lower or nonincreasing hcg levels.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	They can give you an estimate, but it will not be overly accuate.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	no lol, the u/s will tell the age|`|plI0WOrUaa	They can get an idea from the level of your hgc, and from a physical exam of your uterus, but you'll have to wait for the ultrasound for precice dating.|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	I don't believe you, sorry.  2 kids and you don't know the answer to this?

0vsyJqhRaa	You could be pregnant but don't go into major freak-out mode yet. Sometimes teenage girls' periods can become irregular. But you should definitely try 1 or 2 pregnancy tests. If they come out positive (or even negative) go see your gynecologist, if you don't have one and are nervous about talking to your mom, there are clinics you can go to that will help you through. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.optionline.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.optionline.org</a> is a great hotline. Go check them out too!|`|HIO0yvK0aa	there is a chance.|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yeah you could be. Plan B isn't 100% effective in preventing pregnancies but you should be fine. 12 hours is pretty quick and even though I really don't think you are old enough to be having sex, I am kind of proud that you were responsible enough to at least take precautions (even though an even better precaution would have been a condom)|`|aMHIA7XMaa	The morning after pill is pretty effective if taken within 72 hours of having unprotected sex, so your chances of being pregnant are minimal. <br>  <br>  Stress could be delaying your period, but to be absolutely sure, take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Also consider getting tested for STD's - pregnancy is not the only "unexpected surprise" of unprotected sex.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	You have like, a 5% chance if that of being pregnant.  If you took the morning after pill, you should read the instructions and it will tell you the exact accuracy of it.|`|UriE3wN6aa	yeah def. possible but with the injection u wont get your cycles|`|18ncelEeaa	The chances of you being pregnant is minimal because you took the morning after pill, but there is a chance you could be pregnant because the morning after pill doesn't always take effect. You should take a pregnancy test just to make sure, before i got pregnant i used to be late some months and i was having sex with my partner for 2 years without contraceptive and didn't get pregnant till a year after. If you're not ready to have a baby and don't want one don't get your hopes up because the answer isn't always what you want it to be. I am only 16 myself and was 15 when i became pregnant with my 10 week old son so i know what you are going through.|`|rBn4NP5Caa	Stress. Honest! <br>  <br>  <br>  But don't be embaressed to buy a pregnancy test! The sooner you know the easier it will be to sort it. <br>  <br>  Whatever the situation - you're going to be fine. You must calm down and find something to take your mind off this. I would reckomend you take the test as soon as you can (but don't worry too much - anytime in the next 14 weeks or so would be ok) and then just sort things out as they come along.<br>  <br>  Don't worry. These things happen and are easily sorted :-)|`|54JkSGLiaa	you could be. i was 2 months before i even knew i was, but my period was always at different times. i'd say get a pregnancy test and/or go to your local health department for a pregnancy test there. i did both, and i swear i peed on over 20 home tests to make sure.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Yes you could be.  But it could also be the stress that is making you late.<br>  <br>  Go to the docs in the morning and get a pregnancy test.  It will be the only way to find out for sure.|`|e9gDjv6Maa	hahahaahahhaahahahaah wow that sucks...<br>  its funny how you even have to ask. <br>  YES YOU PROBABLY ARE.<br>  have fun with this one.......|`|L1KN7i0aaa	You had sex, so yes you could be preagnant...|`|LBg4DNpCaa	you would not miss your period that quick if you were preggo|`|plI0WOrUaa	absolutely.  You'll have to wait and test.|`|csC8byp4aa	Don't worry too much,<br>  you should have waited till you were a little older<br>  because of your development,<br>  but dont worry<br>  because the more you worry<br>  the later your period will be.<br>  as you had the morning after pill<br>  you could be okay,<br>  but dont think of getting the injection at all<br>  until you have taken i test.<br>  just go into any drug store and get one,<br>  dont worry about what people think,<br>  just do it.<br>  because it will then clear your mind<br>  and help you figure stuff out.<br>  hope this helps you xxx|`|D3As94Dnaa	There is of course a chance you may be pregnant. Take a test and talk to your boyfriend tell him your worries and thoughts see what he has to say. If you are and you don't want to go througth with having it and decide to go on the pill or have an abortion make sure you discuss it throught with your boyfriend first|`|Ev9Rnm0Xaa	it amazes me how judgemental people are on here,its questions and answers not a "im going to boost my confidence by slating a young teen" site so please do your best not to judge.Galway girl its not hugely likely that you are pregnant hun as emergency pill is very effective,hwever there is always a chance you could be pregnant so do a test to put your mind at ease|`|9mafrWGvaa	most contraceptives (the shot, the pill, nuva ring, etc.) require several weeks of use before they are actually effective.<br>  <br>  corollary: if you miss your shot you may have to wait a few weeks after your next shot before your fully protected again.|`|X0HBdCJIaa	you could be take a test. I would say it is stress. It would make me be late a lot.
Zb7CtLxbaa	Assuming you mean a child "in training", yes, I was there before. Kids are miserable enough when they're sick, why make it worse? Just remember once she feels better to get back on track.<br>  <br>  Hope your baby feels better(:|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I agree with you 100%. If my kids are throwing up, feverish, and usually have diarrhea when sick, I get pull ups. If you have to clean up puke, you may as well make the job easier by not having to wash load after load of soiled clothes from the runs. Plus, the kid shouldn't have to make the trip out of bed if they can barely lift a drink of water to their mouths (sickness makes you feel weak). My kids are 3 and 4 and I still do this.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just an fyi, if they want to go to the bathroom or feel well enough, I let them go. It's just more convenient for everyone if there's a saftey net, so to speak.|`|1c4f253198ed74ea909c29db66dcf004aa	I can so see it possible.although my daughter never had that problem for the simple fact she would be so embarrassed.but i know how she feels cause if i could wear a diaper when i am sick so that i can stay in the bed i would to jk.lol.....well don't let know one talk down on you for allowing her to wear diapers while she is sick all kids are different.hope she feels better good luck.......|`|FEhmNTL2aa	My kids were potty trained before 3.  Even sick they knew they had to use the toilet.  But, if she's so sick she can't run to the toilet, I agree with you, be gentle on the poor little girl.  Just have patience, it will be fine.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Mine never ever did that, my boy was potty trained at 2, and my girls 2 & 3, they always went!|`|j2mRop0laa	Yes, mine would do that during "training." <br>  The first two replies seem to think you mean an already fully trained child. I know exactly what you mean.. they would be *almost* there.. almost fully trained- then bam! get sick and the hard work went out the window. It definitely happened when they were 2 and 3.
7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	Its confusing. You must consult your doctor. Sometime 'intense' intercourse also makes you slightly spot. Make sure its not that. Implantation bleeding can't be that early. And be patient, wait and have your test if you miss your period. <br>  Best of luck:)|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Ovulation calendars aren't 100% accurate as every woman ovulates on her own boy's schedule. Use an ovulation prediction kit, it works like a pregnancy test but detects the hormone your body releases prior to ovulation. It really helps to pinpoint the actual ovulation and best time for conception.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0F9b6g5vaa	i have only ever spotted about 3 times during ovulation and i dont know if there is a link but the month i got pregnant i spottted in ovulation and the ovary the egg came out of had turned into a corpus leatul cyst that has been slowly shrinking these past 15 weeks so i think maybe cause the ovary had a cyst forming the blood in ovulation may have come from there ?|`|GWveqx61aa	id say its ovulation bleeding, i had it for 2 days this month, normally its only 1 day for me, weird that its more, implantation can happen about 7-14 days after ovulation. enter your last period, then go through each calander day from there and it will tell you when you should have ovulated and also when implantation may take place, good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/calendar/main" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a>

That is not going to teach them anything. This is only going to make them resent you and cause more problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try taking away privileges such as watching TV or computer time but the MOST important thing is to reward good behavior. This will work better than any form of punishment.|`|ppTbSXxOaa	Whether or not you leave a mark, it's still abuse.<br>  Do your kids a favor and either quit hitting them, or turn yourself in.|`|JJt2gVS7aa	Spanking isn't the best way to deal with kids nowadays.  Try something less violent|`|rUk58ywKaa	I am LMAO at most of these answers.  <br>  <br>  Do you people honestly believe that kids care the least little bit about hurting someone's feelings or anything like that?  Explaining to them means nothing.  It will go in one ear and out the other.  Then they will walk away laughing at you because they just 'won' and 'got away with it'.<br>  <br>  I actually (foolishly) went so far as to take 'parenting' classes and learned all about the 'proper' way to talk to and handle children's behavioral issues.  I gave it an honest shot.  I tried implementing the ideas for several months.  The results?  Within about 3 days my children were behaving significantly worse, and their behavior continued to go downhill from there.  They got to be totally out of control.<br>  <br>  All of you 'anti-spankers' tell me this...  The more trouble the children get into the more privileges we are supposed to take away, right?  What are we supposed to do when we have taken away ALL privileges from our children?  No TV, no computers, no phones, no friends over, no games, no toys, no bikes, no desserts....  Nothing left but a bed and clothing in their rooms yet they still continue to misbehave...  What do you do then?<br>  <br>  I use timeouts and loss of privileges (depending on age) for MINOR offenses, but for major offenses, I believe that nothing short of a spanking (hard enough to sting for a little while) will do.  <br>  <br>  Once I reimplemented my own methods, the behavior of my children quickly turned around and got back under control again.<br>  <br>  Do I want them to fear me?  No, but if fear is all that they will respond to, then fear it shall be.<br>  <br>  As far as the other issue that you directed us to, I believe that the parent was absolutely correct to use spanking for something as potentially serious as firestarting.  However, I never have and never will condone pulling pants down for a spanking.  Specially not in front of others.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Why slap them? I don't understand why people hurt their kids to make them stop doing something. Wouldn't you rather it if your kid knew what they are doing is wrong because of whatever reason it is or just think I can't do this because mom or dad is going to hurt me.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	A spanking shouldn't be used to intentionally cause harm and pain to a child, that is called abuse and should be reported to the police. I have only spanked a child once (my cousin whom I have permission to spank, pull his hair-which I think is wrong and hit him in the head- also wrong), and that was when he ran out into a busy parking lot without me. I gave him one quick smack on the butt and he said, "That didn't hurt." I told him it wasn't supposed to hurt, it was supposed to get his attention because he did something dangerous. That's what a "spanking" is supposed to do, get their attention when they are doing something unsafe, not to cause pain because you are bigger than they are. How would you respond if you husband slapped you three to seven times every time you had an arguement; you'd be on the phone with the cops in seconds I bet. You should stand up for your children, not be the reason they fear the world.|`|Wa0iRt8eaa	it hurts,<br>  if you spank a kid than they will be scared to be around you, it will seem like " oh and i cant mess up cause shes gonna hurt ume if i do, please dont spanking really hurts plus its inbarresing so yes justdon'tt spank,don'tt yell, an idea is to talk to them strongly and say that was wrong and if they do it again tell them oh your not gonna be able to have that sleepover tonight.

Ka52nbhNaa	I did a workshop to support women trying to conceive and we looked into meditation, yoga, talk therapy, counseling, nutrition and acupuncture.<br>  <br>  Acupuncture is thought to be very successful when used in conjunction with fertility treatments and some women who have had ovulation issues start to ovulate as a result of acupuncture.  I have a friend who swears it helped her with ovulation and a luteal phase defect.<br>  <br>  From personal experience, it was more of a stress reliever than anything else. . . . if you can afford it, it cannot hurt and might help - just find someone experienced and who specializes in fertility.|`|7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	You mean fertility shots?<br>  Yes many people go for it, and its an effective way of getting pregnant.|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	I have tried it.

Ka52nbhNaa	It depends on the baby - you should ask your pediatrician.  If the baby is low birth weight, they may want you to wake for feedings every so many hours.  We had to wake our twins every 3 hours for the first month.<br>  <br>  After they had both gained weight, we only waked them during the day (to keep them on the same feeding schedule as is recommended for twins) but let them sleep at night.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|rFtKFp03aa	You should develop the babies day time feeding habits in order to make sure they get enough food during the day to sleep through the night - if they are ready... <br>  <br>  Unless they aren't developing normal, under birth weight, sick  etc... It will be ok to let them sleep through a feeding at night.. <br>  <br>  Best wishes..|`|UriE3wN6aa	depends on how old the baby is and how long they've been sleeping, like a baby newborn to 2 months should be fed every like 3-4 hours no matter what|`|AA11756768	For the first month I was told to do so with my son, if I let him choose when to eat he may have chosen to sleep all day and night instead of eating. After the first month I was told it is ok to let him sleep up 6 hours at night, though you probably want to wake your baby during the day, if they are going without food for that long at some point then they will make up for it during another part of the day, so if you let them sleep through feedings during the day they will make up for it at night which most likely isn't something you want.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Definitely during the day because you want your baby to be on a schedule...as in day and night. If they get them confused it is extremely hard to get them back, from experience. Don't wake them at night though. Let them wake on their on and then feed them. If they sleep all night, no worries. Of course check on them if you feel uncomfortable with them sleeping all night. But try not to wake them.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	During the daytime - yes, wake the baby up.  At night - no, never!|`|3312f7794b231ac6cf8ae7dff5c43aa7aa	when i first had my daughter i would wake her up during the night to feed her..which became very exhausting.I talked it over with my doc and she told me to always feed on command..I promise if your baby gets hungry you will know..dont wake to feed.whether its during the day or at night.if you do so at night it will become a routine for the baby to wake during the night and you dont want that..good luck..youll get the hang of it..this advice is for a healthy baby only.|`|EOyujCyBaa	at the hospital when i had my baby the nurses told me to feed him every 3-4 hours and not to go longer than that and if he didnt wake, to wake him up... but after a couple of days he got used to his feeding routine and started waking by himself most babies will be like that

KyFCYs0Yaa	Call the pharmacy and get a dose of Benadryl for your baby's weight and age. If he starts having ANY trouble breathing get him to the emergency room right away. If the hives seem to be itching him, you can dab some calamine lotion on the spots with a cotton ball.<br>  Sometimes they can break out in hives for no apparent reason. it can also be caused by a viral infection like the flu or even a cold!|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	It really depends on what caused them.  Do you know?|`|AA10766729	There's children's Benadryl, but check with your pediatrician first to make sure this is ok to use with a baby the same age as yours.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	get a towel and make it warm. then place it over the areas that are the most affected. it will sooth the hives and will make it less itchy|`|2I5XqMDzaa	try aveeno baby lotion it works for that kind of thing|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	GIve her/him a Dr. appt...DUH!!|`|6CSBvVxtaa	give the baby a bath with oatmeal  oats in it<br>  honset, it is what you are supposed to do<br>  hope i helped =]]|`|TbYQyxM0aa	Thats simple, just some allergies.

JT4OSUPeaa	I was confused by it also, I kept thinking I lost my mucus plug when I was pregnant cause all the the discharge and stuff...well you know...<br>  <br>  Well, I was induced and when I was about 3 or maybe 4cm dialated the nurse came in and pulled the sheet down and said "oh you lost your mucus plug thats great"....so I guess you don't loose it until your dialated....or maybe it's different for everyone.|`|IwTgq3ezaa	I was confused about this as well. So during my last pregnancy I asked my doctor. He informed me that A) not all women lose their mucus plug, B) it doesn't mean you are going to automatically dilate, C) your mucus plug can actually regenerate (meaning your body can make a new one after one has come out). (Kinda like the amniotic fluid continually regenerates.) I hope this helps.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	Back in my day, when mucus plugs hadn't been invented, life was much simpler.  <br>  <br>  Pretend you don't have one.  They're totally irrelevant.  If you lose one, it doesn't mean you're dilating.  If you dilate, it could still be sort of stuck and not come out.  It's so irrelevant, I don't know why they fry new mums' brains with it.|`|chmuDZObaa	If you are effacing or dilating you COULD lose the mucous plug because your cervix has changed which made it slip out.  It doesn't hold the cervix together though so you don't automatically dilate once it's out.  You can stay at 1-2 cm dilated for weeks before labor.   Some women don't lose the mucous plug until active labor and some lose it weeks beforehand.|`|01vMpHkWaa	hmm dont know how to answer your question but i can tell you that i am 2cm and lost my mucus plug 2 times within the past 2 weeks<br>  <br>  39 weeks
EvXqkrvAaa	If baby is your first you will most likely go over it's just the way it goes most times. I answered your other question too....Get your membranes swept it worked wonders for me I was 4 days over due when I had it done and I was also 2cms for a few weeks before my due date but hadn't lost any of my plug|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Is this your first child? If it is, it is more likely you will go overdue. You can be dilated for weeks before going into labor. I had many, many contractions a day for weeks as well, and didn't go into labor until 41 weeks. And the walking doesn't do anything. I was walking at least 2 miles a day to try to encourage my little one to come out. But... the mucus plug might be promising. Especially if it's bloody. If it is, it will probably only be days. Why are they going to induce so early? My doctor wouldn't induce until 42 weeks. I thought that was the norm. I really hope you go soon!!! Good luck!|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	There is no saying...At this point it could be today or you could go 10 days overdue ( they wont let you go past that ) so just think it wont be more than 2 weeks for sure :)<br>  I was one week late exactly and went into labout the day before my scheduled induction...keep walking! If baby is not here at your 40 week appointment ask for a membrane sweep|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	I don't know how likely per say, but it sounds like you're getting pretty close.  Hopefully within the next few days.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|AA12395149	If it's your first, there's a pretty good chance you'll go over due, the body is just mean like that.  <br>  <br>  In addition to the walking, try having sex.  There needs to be lots of foreplay that involves a lot of nipple play and orgasms for you (orgasms and nipple play release a hormone called oxytocin, which will cause contractions).  When you are done having sex, you need to raise your bottom by placing a pillow under it, allowing the semen to pool against your cervix for at least 20 minutes (semen has prostagladins that help to soften your cervix and also stimulates contractions).  <br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	You will probably go late sorry...but u still have a week...Good luck!|`|1VOsRV8Maa	You never can really tell how soon or late you'll go. I had braxton hick's as well for quite some time, and went into labor (with contractions every 15 mins all day every day) 5 days overdue. My dr eventually induced me on the night of my 9th day over. I had my baby 10 days overdue! He was well worth the wait! Your baby will come whenever he/she is ready! Be patient, mama! It'll be over soon, and you'll miss being pregnant! I promise! I missed it too! Now, my son's 8 months old and I got my wish! I'm 11 weeks pregnant with baby #2! :)|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	by the sounds of what  your doing you may go on time or before... keep it up and the very best of luck ok xxx
oXIYHsDaaa	get a new doctor. Breastfeed until at least a year and start introducing solids when your baby can <br>  1) sit up<br>  2) has lost the tongue thrust reflex that pushes everything out of her mouth<br>  3) is still hungry after 8 - 10 good feeds a day<br>  4) is interested in food ie: is grabbing for your food, screaming incessantly when others are eating around her.<br>  <br>  These signs are more important then a certain age, many will say 6 months, but if your baby's not showing the signs at 6 months wait longer, if your baby is showing all the signs at 5 months then start then.|`|jBxW6ee9aa	Get a new Doctor. My dad has had 6 kids, and he says that you should wait till you baby is older to give baby food. And you should wait till at least 6 months till real food like meat.... so yeah, get a new doctor.|`|X2G8EHBlaa	I would definitely get a new doctor because babies are ot supposed to have baby cereal or food until 4 months  of age and your baby isn't even a month old.  The doc obviously doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	God no! get a new doctor!!! He is crazy-you sohuldn't start your baby on food until 6 months, with 4 being the VERY earliest! And even then, not chopped up meat!!! Bloody hell, your doctor sounds like a nutter!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	What? Was he being serious? There is no way a baby that is 3 weeks old should be eating anything but breast milk! I mean, he couldnt eat that food even if you tried to feed him!|`|0psCy0XXaa	Trust your intuition, what does your baby actually need?  For the first three months breast milk is sufficient, anything after that depends whether your baby is getting enough milk from you.  <br>  If you don't believe your doctor- always get a second opinion.  Remember it's your baby, and do what feels right for both of you.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Wow, sounds like you might need a new doctor... I can actually see some doctors suggesting cereal at that age for certain things like acid reflux, but meat?! Seriously, I just started giving my son some meat and he's 1! Give you baby nothing but breast milk until she's about 4-6 months old, whenever she starts showing signs that she's ready to eat other things then go for it... but look for a new doc. That guy sounds crazy!|`|soebUPtmaa	your dr is very crazy you dont give no baby that small no food. not even time for ceral in the milk until she is like 4 months some ppl do it at 2 becuase the milk doesnt fill up as much after awhile<br>  ans mine plz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AljJ0GCYyTgQQepMvE3dxhTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221112421AAE6rBw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|PLgNsOF9aa	If your baby is just over 3 weeks old she is not ready to eat anything that isnt milk in a bottle or breast. Thats utterly ridiculous.|`|LCHnUuS6aa	You are not being serious are you?  Nothing apart from milk until baby is at least four months.  If the doctor was serious, then change your doctor.|`|pZg05uygaa	Your doctor is wrong, giving food to a one month old could have very serious consequences. Get a new doctor.|`|PMXcXWyYaa	3 months, yes. 3 weeks? no!- the baby could choke or get really bad tummy aches- i wouldn't do it.|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	Definitely get a new doctor. This guy has no idea what he's talking about!|`|K0d1Ko0Saa	You should definetly get a new Doctor! <br>  <br>  A baby can start having puree veg and fruit at about 4months but recomended that they should only start at 6 months and you shouldn't give meat until later - 7 months old lamb and pork and you should wait till your baby has got used to these before giving chicken & Beef etc.<br>  <br>  It is also easier if you pump some milk so that you can get your baby used to drinking from a bottle and that way you can switch to formula and add some cereals once your baby gets more hungry.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|rSjmOaU7aa	Get a new doctor!  CHEESE N RICE IS HE NUTTS??!  MY doctor said you should wait until she is 4 or 5 months and THEN introduce BABY rice cereal. I think the reason is because babies' digestive systems aren't fully well developed yet.  You got to start with baby cereals then you move to first stage purees and so on.  Oh and you have to only introduce one new thing for a few days before another so that if there are food allergies that your baby has, you can know from what is causing it.  Or wait here you go: StartHealthyStayHealthy.com|`|2qLhC7kBaa	i say that you should go to another doctor just for an advice if he says the same thing don't change him if he says something else change your old doctor.<br>  Good luck.|`|Y0FSVQtraa	No Way...She doesn't have any teeth. Start giving her cereal around 3 or 4 months...maybe you should get a new docter.! You would not want to risk your baby choking!|`|BgY4SeCBaa	no no no only give him or her baby food not any thing else untell she stops pooping every thing she eats|`|IRZ4czGPaa	your doctor is nuts!<br>  dontttt youre gonna mess up her little stomack they dont ned anyhting but breastmilk at that age.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	H*ll no you should not give a 3 weeks old baby food!  You need a new Doctor..........the one you have is an idiot!  The earliest I have heard of giving a baby single grain rice cereal alone is 3 or 4 months.
jwftwLBTaa	Totally normal to feel overwhelmed. It is just the fear of the unexpected.<br>  When your done worrying about pregnancy, then you have to worry about raising and caring for a child. We all survive. <br>  My advice- do not listen to anyones horror stories about being pregnant and giving birth. It just creates excess worry. Tell them immediatly that you do not want to hear it!<br>  Get some really good books about pregnancy and enjoy it! It is a wonderful time! I know- I did it three times|`|CYcqQb6Caa	it is normal to be scared your first time being pregnant. it is however very important not to stress your self out at the same time. Stress can be very harmful to you and your baby. Go to the book store and find some books on baby's and parenting. There are also websites that you can visit and they will help. As long as you give your child love and care then they will turn out ok. Stress can also cause a miscarriage remember that ok hope this helps and congrats on your marriage and baby.|`|UriE3wN6aa	lol calmmm downn dont stress yourself out bc that is the number 1 cause of miscarraiges lol so be calm haha.

Sometimes I am so terrified it's not even funny...even though we wanted and planned for this baby!  The miscarriage worry is a biggie but just try not to think about it.  A friend of mine who's had several miscarriages told me just to assume everything is fine unless you hear otherwise and I thought that was pretty good advice.<br>  <br>  Oh and don't watch movies/shows where someone has pregnancy complications or miscarriages, it's just not a good thing for your stress levels & emotions at this time.  I found that out the hard way.|`|OvHGC3yJaa	It is perfectly normal to be nervous but I would go down to my local library and pick up a few books for expectant mothers. The baby bargains books are great for picking out safe furniture for your new baby. Ask your physician for advice and if available your mother. Since October is usually open enrollment look into the maternity leave program and upgrading insurance plans though your job for your family. Keep a journal and Good Luck!|`|3312f7794b231ac6cf8ae7dff5c43aa7aa	i know the feeling trust me..its something i cant explain..you will be a different person when you have the baby..its the best experience in the world..but it comes with alot of worrying.thats just what mothers do honey..we worrying ourselfs sick sometimes...its very normal to be scared.try to stay relaxed and calm right now bc stress is a no no if your scared you might miscarry.stress can cause alot of problems even with ppl that arent preggo..youll be fine.congrats to you guys..your about to go on a wonderful journey!!!|`|qaoIdRSZaa	i am in the same boat, we just found out we're pregnant, due late october :) <br>  all the things u just said i am goign through too, its good to see theres others out there :D<br>  tho i knew there woudl be!!<br>  Good luck with everything, you are going to be an awesome Mum :D|`|plI0WOrUaa	Its so normal to be overwhelmed and scared.

145RUNQHaa	The CIO method is a matter of choice but in my personal opinion you will be creating a possible insecurity problem if you leave him to cry.there's no guarantee it will work might make things worse and goes against natural parenting instincts to nuture and comfort your child.your child may not be well a medical condition may be causing his behaviour and if i were you i would be taking him to the doctors before trying any method.if He's crying the way you describe i would be concerned don't assume it's just sleep deprivation.if doctor says all is fine try a gentler method of sitting on his bed holding his hand for the first few nights if if crys that's ok at least you are there and he won't feel abandoned.then get a chair sit by his bed holding his hand for a couple of nights then move the chair further away over the nights but sit there perhaps just say ssh when it comes time to stop holding hands you are too far away give him a hot water bottle in a fluffy cover or something comforting to hold instead.if he gets out of bed consistently put him back in.wait until he is tired before taking him to bed.be consistent over the nights and the aim is that you can tuck him in maybe potter about upstairs until he settles then go down.i find this a gentler method with more chances of success it will be hard but better than leaving him to cry on his own.also try a winding down routine of bath story and bed.i definatley would stick with a toddler bed and not go back to crib.xx|`|QXSFpMzDaa	I know a lot of people don't agree with the method but I am a huge fan of Cry It Out (CIO).  I would never let my child scream for hours on end but at 16 months old they can cry for 30 min.  I will absolutely check on him but when you do make it no nonsense.  No picking up no cuddling.  Just straighten him out, give him a paci (if he wants or uses one); and let him be.  It is so hard at first I know.  But you have to be strong and firm.  Trust me later on when they will learn to self soothe you will be doing yourself and especially him a favor.  It is also good to have a routine.  Does he nap during the day?  at 16 months my daughter was napping from 1pm-3pm (even if she was awake she would stay in her crib til 3 and happy to do so!) and we would put her to bed at 8pm promptly and she got up at about 6:30am usually.  She is now 22 months and still is on the same routine.  Just be consistent and try the CIO method.  Start a nighttime routine (bath, book, bed) and see where it takes you.  It will take a few days but it does get easier; I promise!|`|A7XL1eH6aa	I did that with my son at about that age.  My aunt helped me so much she said let him cry, and time it for 10-15 min if he's not asleep, then to check on him.  It's tough but ever since then, when it's bed time, its bed time for him.|`|1LdgTQodaa	hi,i know just how your feeling.ive got 16 mnth old twins and its only during the last few months that theyve been sleeping through most of the night.they used to constantly wake up crying and i mean every few hrrs and we kept having to bring them in the bed .but as most people know this only makes things worse.myself and partner just wernt getting any sleep either obviously.<br>  so i decided that we had to do something,and we started leaving them to cry .it is difficult because they can go on for ages.even though we have three older ones it has always been a problem knowing what to do for the best.when they in the state that theyre just screaming and screaming as if theyre going to pass out it is really difficult to carry on because you think something might happen.but the truth is all theyre doing is trying to get theyre own way.as soon as we used to pick them up they would of course suddenly stop crying.so in the end we did leave them to cry,every five mins or so in the beginning ide just go in pop the dummy in and walk out even if they were still screaming.eventually they will get the message and will be so tired that they just fall asleep.but it does take alot of effort to get there.it can go on for hrs in the begining.but after a few days mine were going down easily with a bottle at night awake then when theyd finished i used to put their dummies back in and theyd be happy to go to sleep.now theyre used to it and most of the time they sleep till about 7am.with some exceptions of course.but if your at that stage where no one is sleeping then you definatley need to start doing something beause it can make life hell and everyone is always worked up,dreading bedtime.sleep deprivation is definatley one of the worst things to go through.so if you can i would start letting them cry it will be difficult but if you stick to it then you will see the differences that it makes and everyone will be a lot happier.i hope this has helped and good luck.|`|UUysEV0yaa	Does he have a pacifier/dummy? Or maybe a comforter like a blankie or a toy that he likes?<br>  The reason Im asking is because my son has slept through the night since he was 7 months old- which was the day he finally took a dummy. I SWEAR by those things!!<br>  He is also 16 months now, and to go tp bed (even during the day), he has his dummy (which is on a short clip attached to his shirt so he can reach it if it falls out), and his blankie. I place him in the cot, turn on his mobile and shut the door. Viola! 5 mins later he is asleep<br>  He used to be a HORRIBLE sleeper, like we had to rock him to sleep, carry him to sleep, swing him to sleep. The day he took a dummy saved our life! lol<br>  I personally disagree with the CIO method.|`|xRFLXYDzaa	From experience, my parents got out of bed every time I cried when I was little and I would only slept when they were around. I was dependent on them being there. However, when my younger brother cried, they would not go to him and he eventually fell asleep. <br>  <br>  If he is crying that much that often, I would call the doctor. There might be something that is really hurting him inside his body.<br>  <br>  Good luck and try to get some good night sleep.|`|AA11961491	No amount of crying it out would get our son to adapt to sleeping in his crib. Our son was an absolute terror until we put away the crib and moved him into a queen sized futon at 12 months that mom or I could crash on with the kid.  We also got dead serious about the routine -- very rigid.  Dinner. Bath. Book+Blanky, Bed+Paci.<br>  <br>  We lay him on the futon and stay with him until he falls asleep.  It took about a month for him to sleep through the night wihout needing us at all.  BUT we saw immediate improvements in his sleep after moving to the futon -- he would only wake up two or three times a night.  Now he only wakes up when his diaper over-fills and he's decently good at going back to sleep if we get to the diaper soon enough.<br>  <br>  Of final note, we've had to accept that his teething was painful enough to warrant nightly motrin usage.  The pediatrician winced when she looked in his mouth and said it made her mouth hurt just looking at it.<br>  <br>  Yes, you have to be consistent -- BUT you gotta recognize when something isn't working and be willing to try new things.  Plus it helps to know WHY your kid is waking up.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I know it's miserable beyond description.|`|NyNMe8jWaa	you must be exhausted!  if he's walking in circles all day just crying and fussing (pick me up! put me down! listless and antsy all wrapped up in one bundle), it probably is because he is sleep deprived.  just good old fashioned "over tired".  and he cries all day about it because being that tired physically hurts (as i'm sure you can attest to yourself after being up with him every hour or so in the night!).  how is just leaving him to cry it out working for you so far?  and does he cry himself to sleep and then wake up repeatedly in the night and cry for long periods of time then as well?<br>  <br>  my suggestions:<br>  if you don't have a bedtime routine at this point, you need to establish one.  dinnertime, a little after dinner play, bath time, read a story (i'd advise against watching a video at this age since toddlers get REALLY excited to see anything brightly colored and moving across the t.v. screen), kiss and cuddles goodnight.  then it's bedtime.  <br>  <br>  this will be difficult, but i've found it to be effective in most of the cases i've encountered:  put him in his bed while he's still awake (if you rock him, rock him until he's drowsy, but not fully asleep).  if he's in a "big boy bed", leave the room.  if he cries and stays in bed, he's already got the idea.  he just needs to soothe himself to sleep.  if he gets up and comes out, take him by the hand and walk him back to bed, kiss him goodnight and tell him it's bedtime.  place him back in bed and leave the room.  next time he comes out, do the same.  anytime after that, just walk him back to bed and don't say a word. he's used to getting a lot of banter back-and-forth and if you shut down your end of the conversation, he'll have nothing to feed off of.  the first couple of nights you do this, it may be a long, long process.  but within a few days to a week, he'll be going to sleep on his own and able to soothe himself back to sleep if he wakes in the night.<br>  <br>  if he's in a crib (and you may want to invest into a crib that converts to a toddler bed so you can make an easy, less expensive transition later on), do the evening/bedtime routine all the same as above.  but when you put him down to sleep, stay in the room.  in a chair, or sitting on the floor.  just so you're where he can see you without having to get up and look around.  lay him down.  if he cries but stays laying, it's a good sign.  it's hard to listen to him crying, but tough it out.  if he stands up, lay him back down and tell him it's bedtime.  same if he does it again.  any time after that, don't do a thing.  just sit in your chair or in your spot on the floor and don't say a word.  and keep your head down.  eye contact, cooing, conversation will all start a back-and-forth cycle and he'll feed off the interaction.  he will cry.  it will be super tough, but he knows that you are there and that he's okay.  as time progresses, move yourself closer and closer to the door, and once he is quiet, leave the room.  if he wakes and you go back in, start over (lay him down. say it's bedtime. progress yourself towards the door).  again, this may take a few nights before he is okay with you putting him down to sleep with a kiss and cuddle and just leaving the room, but within a week he should be sleeping like a champ.<br>  <br>  a lot of people will tell you that letting him cry it out is cruel (and you already know how hard it is on you, the parent, to let him cry), but remember: you've already tried it the other way.  you've already rocked him to sleep and tended to his every cry in the night.  that didn't work for your son.  this method of letting him cry it out will teach him to know that you are there for him, but that bedtime is bedtime is bedtime.  just like with time-outs, or insisting on a sippy cup instead of the bottle/breast, etc.  being consistent is the most important part.<br>  <br>  good luck with your little one.  i hope you all get some good sleep very, very soon!
He1WjHifaa	i had a csection and i started feeling pain the day after but it only lasted for 5 days then i felt fine so try and just deal with it. if you have a really low tolerance for pain ask the doctor about another pain medication..otherwise try and handle it..the sooner youre off pain meds the better and the pain really doesnt last long if you rest alot and try not to move around alot|`|rvoo4rBjaa	It will get better! rest up|`|VtxtY3hXaa	ask youre doctor|`|7rIAd6gGaa	3 days after my c-section I was still in A LOT of pain. That's totally normal. Especially after laboring and pushing (I was in labor 33 1/2 hrs and pushed for a 1/2 hour before they realized she was sunny side up). Are you home already?!? I thought they kept everybody 5 days after a c. I stayed 6. I would definitely tell your doctor the meds aren't working well enough. And I wouldn't use the dermplast on an incision... I don't think it's meant for open wounds like that. I was taking motrin and tylenol, but only because the perkaset (which really worked!) made me too loopy. Your doctor should be able to help. Good luck!!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	To be on the safe side ask the doc. <br>  When I had my son I had a vaginal birth and as a result I had 4th degree tear (from front to back). I used dermaplast as needed for the pain.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your new bundle of joy & God Bless you both. :)|`|98WKYtfwaa	Don't put any numbing spray on it, it could infect it or make it worse. Phone up your doctor and tell them it's really sore, it's normal to hurt but not as much as what you're feeling. It could already have an infection.|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	u should tell ur doc. u might get an infection if one of the stitches has ripped. but from what i kno... c sections hurt for a long time until the wound is closed and the stitches are removed. but u should tell a doc just in case.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	you could ask your doctor for stonger pain meds. and just ask call the doctor's office and ask if that spray is safe to use|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	You just had a c-section it's going to hurt longer then 3 days...take the pills & sleep!!!

VZVGXRyraa	I think, legally, it's somewhere between 12-14.  But that in no way means it's alright for you to leave them just because they're of age.

u2vw1W9yaa	yeah, its pretty common, just not too common to hear about it...|`|LiKMlFfzaa	do you
IwTgq3ezaa	Yep, it's normal. Some women don't produce colustrum until later in their pregnancy. I'm on my 3rd pregnancy and I'm about 17? weeks. I typically start producing colustrum around week 20. My suggestion is, if you're overly worried about it, have your doctor check you out. My guess is he'll tell you you're fine, though. :-) Don't listen to your fiance, lol. Also, you might want to buy some breast pads, to help with the leaking. You can get them most anywhere...drug stores, walmart, target, etc. Then you won't leak thru to your shirt.|`|mTQutqyAaa	it normal and it's not really milk. i can't remember what the term for it is( i think colostrum).  the real milk doesn't come in til a day or 2 after u give birth. i really recommend u get what to expect when ur expecting it's a month by month guide to the things that r happening to ur body and ur baby. it's extremely helpful. there are gonna b alot more things happening during ur pregnancy that will freak u out or make u wanna call ur doc and that book really clears things up and details when u should worry about certain things that might happen, especially during the last few months. if i hadn't had it i would've been freakin out alot. good luck and congratulations!|`|C6oTOvOMaa	It varies from woman to woman and many pregnant women notice this very early in there pregnancies while others may not until the third trimester or so. But just to be on the safe side of things, ask your doctor, if u are ever concerned about anything going on with your body during pregnancy always ask your doctor...|`|kKmuFi4zaa	The milk should have came after you gave birth. Talk to your doctor or a L&D nurse ASAP. Whatever you do, don't squeeze more milk out, you will continue to lactate if you do that.|`|AA12395149	Most women don't start producing milk until just before delivery or soon after.  However, it is not abnormal to start producing milk early in pregnancy.  You don't need to call right away or schedule an appointment with your doctor just because of this issue, just bring it up in your next scheduled visit.  <br>  <br>  You can deal with it by wearing breasts pads so your tops are protected.|`|duinadV4aa	yes this is normal it's not milk yet it's the pre milk colostrum you want get the real thing until after the baby is born|`|DoaMYpfMaa	ask your doctor for sure i don't think it is normal you might have a hormone problem|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yea its normal
1Sjxhuo4aa	John, I understand you're worried. Your wife is soon to be due, so the stress is finding it's way into your dreams. Many times we dream about what worries us the most, and it's only natural to worry about your wife and kids at this point. My advice to you: try to stop thinking about it. Talk to your wife about it (if you haven't already) and realize that there are many other fathers out there feeling just like you. Try searching for a forum about new fathers to chat with people such as yourself. Don't worry about it, the chances of anything happening is virtually non-existant for a healthy woman like your wife. Congradulations on being a father to be, an I wish you the best of luck!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	it is very normal for girls and guys have these types of dreams before the baby (babies) come|`|XDftaldzaa	pray to god and ask him to bring your kids and wife through a perfect delivery...and tell the devil to take his hand off your mind and bind him off of your family in the name of Jesus.
1VOsRV8Maa	Yes! It is very common! I'm the 5th child of 9, and so I've seen (and BEEN) quite a few "babies" of the family. Not laughing at this behavior is the first step to correcting it. Also, at 5 months, that is a bit young for that behavior. He may actually be trying to "be heard." My son (I only have one of my own so far), does it from time to time as well. He's not really bossy, but sometimes can be very loud if we're not paying attention to him 24/7. He just wants to make sure you know he's there. My little sister (The baby... She's 17 now) was like that to a point. If us "big kids" were doing something, she wanted to be part of our "crowd" and would make herself known until someone involved her. My mother (along with my sisters and myself) would mostly just tell her yelling is not ok, but she can use her nice voice if she'd like us to play with her. With 8 siblings, she was not deprived of attention by any means! LOL! If your baby is acting "bossy," be bossy right back, but make sure he knows that YOUR word is actually the last one! He's young... He'll learn fast! Good luck! have fun!
x0bJmyDPaa	It depends on how long your cycle is, and they can vary from month to month.  Women usually ovulate about 14 days prior to their next period (not 14 days after your last one) - so if you have a very short cycle (which can and does happen to a lot of women occasionally) then, yes, it's possible to fall pregnant during your period.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i got pregnant during my period|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, you can get pregnant while you are on your period.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Extremely unlikely.<br>  Id say about a 1 in a 100000 shot.  Why?  Cause most women dont ovulate when they have their periods unless they have about a 2 week cycle.  And, its impossible for a baby to implant when you are bleeding as thats what they implant into!|`|plI0WOrUaa	There is always a possibility.  Its never safe if you don't want to get pregnant.|`|kP3Ryfyuaa	not very likely, but you should use protection to be safe!|`|IwTgq3ezaa	It CAN happen, but it's really rare.

ZtzKsVjdaa	Your friend simply isn't mature enough to have a child.  She's having them for the wrong reasons and she will most likely be incompetent at taking care of the baby.

Good luck|`|MHeOHOnbaa	tell her she is trying something that is bad she may think that she is ready but i doubt that she is and it sounds like she is sadistic. and he might think she decieved him and deny the child and leave her and it sounds like he still has feelings for his ex and getting your friend as a rebound chick and that might be why he is not ready.|`|tLcOikV8aa	Tell her back off im trying to have sex here|`|WGadfTJaaa	Clearly your friend is vindictive and very messed up  you can't reason with a  person like, this she'll do what ever it takes to get pregnant  and learn the hard way  and so will her baby <br>  <br>  She seems more interested in hurting her partners ex wife instead of respecting her partners wishes  which is really wrong if he isn't ready she should respect that, when he is ready  it will be special but forcing the issue will only make him hate her.<br>  <br>  I hope your friend wakes up to herself before she makes a huge mistake
PT4InZXlaa	i had was pregnant with my daughter when my son was a year old and still nursing exclusively .instead of weening him i let the milk dry up and he weened himself.sorta.i started giving him a cup off and on during the day and when the milk was gone he just kept using his cup<br>  the milk dried up about the 5-6 month of my pregnancy|`|7rIAd6gGaa	How old is your baby?|`|S1LxX6CNaa	The key to weaning any child, especially very little one like your son, is to go gradually. You will be asking him to make two major changes in his life, no more nursing and no more sleeping together. This is a very big deal.<br>  It would be very helpful if you could put a smaller bed next to yours temporarily, lie there with him to go to sleep and then move over to your own space. Not being as close to your body should encourage him to nurse less at night and putting just a little space between you at first instead of a whole room, (hallway, house, whatever it may be), could really help him not feel so overwhelmed by the changes. <br>  Also, it is really important to communicate with your baby. He is very little and, of course, can't understand when you say you want him to stop nursing and sleep on his own. But, if you tell him with confidence and kindness (while nursing is a good time) that soon he won't need to nurse at night and that he will be able to sleep in a bed of his own, and repeat the message each night, he will begin to understand the changes that are slowly happening. <br>  He may not be happy about even the littlest change, or he may take it all in without any trouble. If you are moving slowly but surely toward your goal, he will adjust in time. <br>  It probably seems like a long road ahead if you plan to go about it gradually. But it will be less frustrating and work more effectively if he doesn't feel pushed aside which will only make him cling and feel more needy of your presence, time, and milk. In my experience, pushing too fast makes them want to nurse MORE often!<br>  Once he is not nursing as much at night, you can start to tell him that you won't be nursing him at night anymore. Or maybe, if that is too sudden, try, "tomorrow night we will only nurse one time at night, in your bed. after that, I will hold you or give you a drink of water if you need it but not nurse you because you and I need to sleep." Let him know that you expect he will sleep in his space more and more and, if possible, when he wakes, scoot over to him to keep him there in his bed. It won't really make sense to him and he will probably still fuss. But, then, when he wakes fussing to nurse after you have already nursed all you are going to for the night, you can tell him again, "remember, we aren't going to nurse anymore tonight. now you can have some water or I will hold you." Be patient, the changes are big for him and he may protest. But firmly and consistently communicating the plan to him and then following through should move you toward your goal. <br>  After he is no longer night nursing and is sleeping in his space consistently, you can move his bed to his room. If I were you I would leave the getting to bed nursing for last. When he is not nursing during the night anymore, then start talking about the plan to eliminate the bedtime nursing. A bath to get him sleepy, some herbal tea (sleepytime, no sugar), a story and a cuddle in bed (maybe with dad if having you there and not nursing is too hard for him). <br>  All the time you need to keep letting him know what you are doing through conversation and consistent demonstration. <br>  Someone else may be able to tell you how to do this more quickly. But I believe strongly that kids need to know you have confidence in their ability to be independent but that you also understand that they are only kids and you are there for them when they need you. Taking slow steps toward independence, speeding up if he seems comfortable, slowing  more if he feels overwhelmed will help him know he can get there eventually and you are there to guide him and love him. <br>  Best of luck in your transition. Let me know if I can offer more advice or information. <br>  Best wishes,|`|AA12395149	Bind your breasts tightly.  When you shower, try to not let the stream of water hit them directly.

OI3bf4yjaa	Yes, it's normal. Sucks, don't it?|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Leaking is perfectly normal during pregnancy but I would check with the doc just to make sure. Tell him how much you are leaking. Maybe you could start doing some kegels. Giving birth could possibly make your pelvic muscles weaker also and could cause more leakage. Good Luck|`|AA12395149	Nothing to be concerned about, other than public embarrassment.  Do kegel exercises.  When you pee, try to stop going mid stream, the muscles you used to do this are called kegel muscles.  Through out the day do them in sets of ten or more (whenever you're sitting idle...at the desk, watching TV, at red lights while driving).  Vary how long you hold them.  Do some quickly and hold for short periods of time.  Do some slowly and hold it for longer.  Strengthening your kegels will help you to control your bladder better.<br>  <br>  If your concern is that you just have to go all the time, yeah, that's normal.  You still need to make sure you stay well hydrated for both you and the baby and to minimize the risk of getting a bladder infection.<br>  <br>  However, If you are peeing every 5 minutes, feel like you are not completely emptying your bladder, and/or have burning with urination, you should see your doctor to see if you have a bladder infection (UTI).<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|plI0WOrUaa	I have days like that where i feel i am not going to make it to the bathroom.

im3vWyv6aa	For my girls it took about a year of frustration before it would stay tucked behind their ears. But, I'm really glad I did it. It is soooo cute on them and they no longer need the frequent hair cuts.<br>  <br>  The only thing I found that works is bobby pins. Get the non slip bobby pins and pull her bangs up on top of her head. Make a crisscross with the bobby pins to hold her bangs out of her face and use a little hair spray. I would also, before making the crisscross, push the bangs forward a little making a little poof on top. It added some volume instead of flat bangs pinned up. (I hope that makes sense.)<br>  <br>  I found that all other clips don't stay in and I discovered that making a little pony off to the side breaks the hair. I ruined Shanna's hair doing that. I didn't make that same mistake when I grew out Kathrina's bangs.<br>  <br>  Good luck... it's worth all the frustration in the end.<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	It can take awhile depending on how fast her hair grows, but just get some cute hair clips to put them up for now.|`|hVVALFAPaa	Hair grows at about 1/2 inch per month, or 6 inches per year. To reach behind her ears, she would probably need 3 or 4 months.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, use those little snap barrettes to hold the bangs back or the soft elastic headbands. Once it gets a bit longer, you can also sweep the bangs back into two small ponytails, one on each side-- into what we used to call 'devil horns'-- really cute on little girls. The bangs are contained but the rest of her hair hangs down.<br>  <br>  My daughter had bangs with the rest of her hair to her behind and it took years to grow out. Then she decided to donate her hair to a wig-maker for kids with cancer.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have patience!|`|j2mRop0laa	Mine were about that age when I started *side sweeping* their bangs and putting a clip to keep it in place.

Unlike you, i was the mom that thought, "OH but she has to have bangs! She has to! If she doesn't then she won't be my little one anymore" lol. And my eldest daughter hated them and ended up cutting them. we let her grow them out after that...ahha. But that's just my little story to tell...:) thought it would make you laugh.<br>  <br>  Yeah, so if she complains about them...i would definitely get them out of the way. :)Have fun with your little girl!
38824a69f42c37f0e048158c3d0e0a30aa	I would say 23 weeks.  And you're having a girl?<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	18 weeks... girl :-) <br>  <br>  That's such a guess. I don't even think you look that far along (you look great btw), but since you know the gender, I had to up my guess a few weeks.|`|39984ef6f9b7fadcbaadba7d46f23d49aa	I guess that your going to have a baby, And you are well on your way. P.S. Happy Mothers Day in advance.|`|79eRDIbXaa	18 weeks - Boy?!?!?xx|`|YgGi07Rpaa	maybe 7 weeks IDK?? and a boy??|`|yV337gGyaa	20 weeks?? and a girl?|`|AA10458750	13 weeks...and nobody can tell what u r having! lol.|`|90zcKChJaa	18 weeks...and a Boy..that's my guess ;)|`|XgSHNV6maa	hmmm.... 22 weeks?<br>  i dont know i looked like that at 7 months the baby hide like i looks like its doing in you! <br>  How far along>!?!?!?1<br>  <br>  I changed my vot to 18weeks|`|l7v0LhT6aa	I am going to say 21 weeks with a....girl!?<br>  <br>  Congrats by the way, you look fantastic!!!!!!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I'll say about 18 weeks with a boy :)<br>  <br>  Congrats either way though, you look fantastic!|`|QSodlfMraa	15, girl?|`|DLDweOcYaa	You don't look very far along.  I know now that you are 24 weeks but looking at your photo I would say about 16 weeks|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Well you're atleast 16 weeks or so if you know the sex already. I'm going to say that you're about 19 weeks and its a boy.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	22 weeks and a girl?|`|bS6RPi9saa	u look like 21wks with a boy congrats
VU4DLpnlaa	my daughter started doing that. now she just screams all the time (2 years) she used to be a happy baby|`|b9035adcbdf28a53a5a80e18a3dc49d7aa	I think this is relatively normal, I have a few friends with babies the same age that whine a lot as well. This is the point when molars start coming in and  that is what causes the whining. Look inside his mouth (if he lets you) and you may find a swollen spot! Good luck!|`|j5aRAJxPaa	Have you taken him to the doctor? Could be teeth, could be growing pains, could be many things. One thing every parent forgets about is taking a break! <br>  If you can,  leave him with a sitter for a couple hours or so or if you can't do that then one of you go for a couple of hours and then switch off.<br>  I would take your angel to the doctors though, just to confirm/rule things out.

68c6B8dRaa	Technically tacky. Sorry...|`|diEZW57caa	Technically, yes, it is bad etiquette to specify "no gifts" because that implies that you were expecting to get some.  I know it seems strange, but that's straight from Miss Manners and she's never wrong :-)<br>  <br>  What I did for my daughter's birthday is when people asked what they could get her I told them that we were starting a college fund and if they wanted to buy her a savings bond we would appreciate that more then any toys, we also used the grandparents to spread the word.<br>  She now has several hundred dollars worth of savings bonds (a $50 savings bond costs $25) and we appreciate that much more then a bunch of toys that we don't have space for.|`|F6d8d6D5aa	I think it sounds respectful if everyone is in a hard money situation.<br>  You know however, people will still bring gifts. Tell them to maybe bring a fav pic instead because you want to make him a memory book, or even their favorite childhood book so you can start him on educational things (never to early). <br>  Just make sure people know how you feel. <br>  <br>  You can even suggest people bring a dish of food instead of a present.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Well, I guess its not bad etiquette but your son is only 2! <br>  <br>  I could see if he were older, but hes just now getting to the age where he can actually open and enjoy his gifts. There only little once. Im sorry, but I would never do that to my Daughter. Kids deserve presents at there Birthday!!!! Dont do that to your son!|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Not bad etiquette, but I have a feeling people will still bring gifts. Thats just life:)|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I hope it is not bad etiquette! I requested no toys for my daughters 2nd birthday last month. I even asked family not to buy toys! They did buy her a couple of summer outfits, and she got a new comforter for her soon to be big girl bed, but we just don't have room for the toys! and it isn't like the house isn't already overflowing with them! We spent special time with her, and she got to enjoy a nice meal with the whole family. She got her cake, and ice cream, and candles, and all of that. just not the toys. I think people take birthdays and Christmas a little too far with the presents anyway! It does make the kids forget that it is the family and friends that are important, and not just the Stuff!|`|lFBR5Cepaa	You can if their level of intelligent is anywhere normal, in an economic melt down a lot of people would appreciate it, but on a friendlier note the child is only 2yrs old, with low expectation and lacks the capacity to understand what having the gifts there are for, so even though i understand what you are trying to do having them bringing him gifts at this point wont break him into having the thought of always expecting something, more over let him have some fun it is his birthday and clearly if you are struggling to make ends meet being in college, you definitely could use some extra help to give your little ones some gift, its only twice a year a child really get to be spoiled and that Christmas and their birthday depending on your religion let him have some fun.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This is actually the trend where I live.  I don't have a toddler but many of my friends do.  "No gifts" is pretty much de rigeur for birthday parties.  <br>  <br>  Lots of parents want to control what toys their children play with.  Also, if you go to a lot of birthday parties for kids, it starts to seem stupid.  You spend all this money so that a bunch of other people can return the favor by buying things your kid may not want or need.<br>  <br>  Of course, some people may still bring gifts, but that's fine.
f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	I think alot of single women here would think twice about having kids with random men if American laws were like Belgium's.  In addition, kids will benefit from knowing both parents instead of only one.|`|3vToYNA2aa	Well if you live in US go by their law..people go to jail for not paying child support and his green card can be revoked...do the best for your daughter...he either goes by these laws or he can live in Italy.He won't be able to come back without consequences...good luck :-)|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sounds like a pretty good argument for birth control to me. Not only will you not owe custody to anyone, you won't have to worry about your child getting kidnaped, or being raised in a particular culture you don't agree with. <br>  <br>  I don't see what Sicily, Italy really has to do with it, though, because this is the US - not Sicily, Italy. It doesn't matter how much you want it to be; the US court system is not going to work the way an Italian court does. Or a Belgian court. Or any other court, for that matter. <br>  <br>  So in that case, I'd say this mother should practice safe sex in order to not get pregnant in the first place, and pick her partners a little more carefully. But if this were the case, I suppose you wouldn't have any hypothetical questions to ask, then. What a pity.|`|sxecXFgraa	Stop asking these questions.  They are boring and getting a little old.
Orx9cTJJaa	Congratulations! You should just sit your parents down and tell them, just to get it over with.But just as a tip, I would have rules and punishments. Everybody needs that. You should(if possible)throw a small party for your closest friends, and maybe write it on the cake, and have you and your fiance bring it out and show everybody.|`|QevBVANtaa	All kids need rules and punishment... ask your mom or friends to go shopping, look at baby clothes.. when they ask why are you looking at baby clothes just look at them and smile, they'll figure it out.
SYrJiDKwaa	The best way to tell your parents is just to tell them.  My mom freaked at first, but now im 6 months, and she's exited for me.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	Don't worry. I am 18 too and 32 weeks pregnant, I was in the same situation, I was engaged but you are so lucky you are done with school, that is awesome, I am still in college. The hardest thing was telling my parents, they were upset at first but now they are really excited for me and happy. Everything will work out for the best.<br>  Congratulations and Good Luck :)|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Be honest and don't do it on a cellphone. My phone happened to die on my right after I uttered the words to my mother, I'm pregnant.|`|QH5oOFutaa	Oh good start!! No rules???? wow.......... nice job!!|`|oep2L50Baa	I got pregnant when i was 18, I'm 19 now and about to have my baby=]<br>  my parents were actually really good at taking the news. my moms been through most of it with me and my boyfriends been great=] just sit down and tell them it should be okay=]|`|hIzQyflqaa	congratulations! your not 15 so dont worry! your parents will be a little bit shocked but when baby is born they will be soooo happy! my mum was disappointed that i got pregnant at 20 but she is so happy i had him and i have another on the way and she cant wait!|`|S5GP2nlUaa	I would wait until your four months along at least so you can make sure everything is okay. I'm not saying it wont be. But congrats. Your 18 though, your parent's can't be mad, your an adult.|`|FY1yQXioaa	Just be honest to your parents and friends. They might be freak out in the beginning, but they will be excited for you after a while. It is really not a big deal.|`|6zPCQ7rPaa	wow, slow down,before you decide on how your going to raise a child. how about asking if you are really mature enough to even be considering it. there are other options.|`|POs5TeUDaa	setting rules doesnt mean that u dont love ur child, so i would rethink the whole "no rules, no punishment" part. i definitely agree with "love and connection'' but no "just" if u know what i mean :p|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	Well, lets face it, you've got to tell them so the best way to do it is just sit them down and let them know that this is something you have thought about and you are ready for...and you want them to support you and be excited for you!  If they are angry at first, trust me, they will get over it!  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have thought about this before you went off and got pregnant which is a good thing....something I am worried about is it doesn't sound like you are as mature as in being ready for this as you think you are!  But...that WILL change when the child gets here...  No rules, no punishments, just love and connection...I think that's going to be alittle harder done than said!  As mothers there are many many times through our childs life where you are going to make them mad and have to tell them no, or even yell at them.  Because the fact is that's our child and we are responsible for protecting them.  We are here to be their parents, not their friends!!!  There is going to be love and connection but because of the love for your child you are going to feel a since of ...."you need to do everything to protect your child...rather that means not being their friends or not."  Ex...what's going to happen when your child is in the buggy at walmart, standing up, you tell them to sit down, they don't do it?  Are you going to let them continue to stand...because if someone runs over you...or you have to suddenly stop...guess where your child could go...out the buggy, onto the floor, which could result in a head injury...etc...or for the least, he/she could fall back in the buggy and bust their lip or something...<br>  <br>  I just think you might want to rethink that...no rules, no punishments things, because children are going to do the opposite of what you tell them to do, and usually when you tell them to do something even if its something small like, sit down, its for their best interest....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QSodlfMraa	hey guys i am pregnant.|`|yrDqtazLaa	I really hope this is a troll question. No rules and no punishments? Good looking out, mom of the year..
5ZwIASCgaa	The first avery i met was a boy but now i know alot of lil girls named avery...so its a unisex name|`|FnIjBY2Aaa	Uhmm, I've always thought it was more of a girl's name.<br>  But, it could work for a boy too.|`|RgWMdA0faa	First Avery I met is a boy.  Its becoming more popular for girls these days|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I love it for a girl, but it can be both.|`|TuBzc1R5aa	boy|`|gl4DFLVGaa	Avery seems girlish I say that cuz of The Real Housewives of New York, the daughter Avery.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	Avery hmmm. I've heard Ava on girls - I'd probably say it was a boys name. It sounds more masculine than feminine..its a very unusual name though, I've never heard it before. Its very very nice though.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I like Avery better for a boy but it can be used for either.|`|ValLVBcYaa	It's both.|`|nUU9U9Asaa	Both..
TJ4q7X8Vaa	Around this time sometimes babies are so interested in looking around that they would rather satisfy their sucking need themselves than eat and look at you. My daughter did this but she grew out of it. She's 10 months old and still nursing. Sometimes it helps if you don't have a lot going on around you like the tv, phone, kids, etc. If you can feed in a quiet dimly lit area it seems to be the best.
oiJITSNZaa	they make something called pregnancy tests|`|AA12384088	Cervix should be high and soft|`|txSiQc7Waa	Cervical positioning is not a reliable source of detecting pregnancy. Most say it should be high, closed, and the texture of a ripe tomato (Soft on the outside with a firm center) but this isn't true for every woman. I've read of women on here saying theirs was high. Others say theirs was low. A missed period and HPT is the best way to find out. It's really probably close enough to your period that you could take a hpt and get a pretty accurate answer. Good luck and baby dust to you!
MHOxPs8Oaa	She doesn't need makeup yet, so no don't say she might as well start now.  Just put your makeup somewhere that she doesn't know about. I have had to do that a lot. I lived with two younger sisters that loved my makeup and now my daughter has been trying to get into it, so just try putting it somewhere that she won't know of.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Very simple, hide your makeup, your house - your rules.  If they don't like it, tell them to move especially since they are living there for free. Then tell your fiance to get a backbone and back you up.|`|711KONwOaa	by her some play make up for her to play with <br>  or <br>  kick them out<br>  or <br>  spank her everytime she goes in your dwars she is not allowed in your personal space<br>  please do my questions|`|FcHplZtQaa	I'd be asking the sister in law to leave, that can't be good at the best of times, never mind with the niece snooping through your stuff!|`|AA11126544	Put the makeup somewhere she can't get it.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Buy a locking tacklebox and lock it up|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Ask the mother of the child to keep her out of your things, or they need to leave.  Tell her that if she thinks the child should be wearing makeup now, then to purchase her some-not to let her use yours.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can put a lock on your bedroom door and you can also purchase a lockbox to put things that you do not want your niece getting into in, but I think that the mother needs to control her child.  A 10 year old knows right from wrong.|`|MFWEkkd9aa	My 8yr old did the same, I got a lockable tool box, now the only time she gets hold of my lippy is when we have a girly night, maybe you should try that with your niece, have one night a month where you do each others hair, make-up and nails, watch a dvd, eat popcorn, listen to music (her favourite of course) and just have a good time, it sounds like a bonding session could do you both the world of good.<br>  The other thing of course is to get her some of her own make-up for Easter/Birthdays/Xmas etc...<br>  <br>  Take care you, Lulu x|`|3312f7794b231ac6cf8ae7dff5c43aa7aa	I have two nieces that done the same thing to me.although they were alot younger than 10.At 10 the lil girl should know to mind.but thats a whole new subject...the only thing to do is hide your makeup or buy her some to play with..BEST ADVICE WOULD BE TO SEND THEM BOTH HIKING...sounds like their freeloaders!!!|`|mpc6aNvCaa	thins is what i did locked mine up but brought cheap stuff and kept it where i used to kept the Other stuff at, but i would tell the mother and if not respected get out. plain and simple|`|TI7WZCooaa	put it somewhere that she can find it, or in a place that she's not allowed|`|KPac9A2qaa	Hide the makeup in a place she can't find it? Scare her? lol|`|10LIhgtkaa	Definitely a locking box for your makeup.<br>  <br>  Her mother has obviously spoiled her child rotten. Ten year olds should know better than to just go through people's things. I would tell the girl that if she behaves herself for a week or so, you'll buy her some  makeup (you can get little bon-bon things at like drug stores or walmart or something for about 88 cents. in the states anyway). Sure, it's a bribe, but since her mother is being less than useless, I would do it. If she manages to be good, take her with you so she can pick out a bag and some stuff. Just let her know which kinds she can get (the cheap kind lol).<br>  <br>  Then sit down with her mother and discuss with her the deplorable behavior of her child. Let her know that the child going through your lingerie drawer is equal to the mother going through it. Possibly recommend that the child should use her mother's makeup instead of yours. I'm sure she wouldn't like it. Let them know it's your house, and that you shouldn't have to lock up your personal stuff against free loaders.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kvmWDuOJaa	The girl is 10, she's old enough to listen to people when they tell her to stop. It's not your fault, it's hers and her mum's.<br>  If I were you, I would either:<br>  - Hide your makeup or put it in a lockable place. You can get pretty cheap jewellery boxes that have tacky little keys. It won't keep out a pro burgaler, but it should keep out a 10 year old XD<br>  -Talk to the little girl about it. If her mum isn't going to, then perhaps you should tell her that she shouldn't use people's things without permission.<br>  -Buy her a little bit of makeup. It only has to be cheap. She'll be so chuffed that I highly doubt she'll carry on using yours- especially if you put it in a makeup bag like yours or something.<br>  -Talk to her mum again, and explain that it's not her using makeup that bothers you, but it's the fact that she's taking other people's things without permission. Perhaps her mum will feel she ought to talk to her.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped! If it did, please consider voting for me? It would mean an awful lot:<br>  <a href="http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h..." rel="nofollow">http://plugaway.weebly.com/please-vote.h...</a>|`|VjGhVGuAaa	omg that sounds so annoying! hide your makeup and tell the little girl she cannot use it, and that is final.
XhIYAH6Laa	I had a c section with my first 2 years ago. I really don't remember numbness around the incision until much later after the fact. Even now if I feel where my incision was it is numb, but I don't think it was that way for a couple months really, when it completely healed. Congrats on your new baby!|`|qeVqBMVraa	Go see your Doctor now!|`|vXYQcixvaa	the numbing effect comes from severing nerves. Maybe you have a different setup of nerves in that area than other people. Not everyone is the same! Mine is numb in some spots and theres feeling in others. Mines actually really sensitive and its been 6 months! my underwear rubs and feels like its sunburnt...if that makes sense.|`|b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	Hi ,I don't remember any numbness ! ..a little tender and later itchy is what I remember and I healed well...|`|dTPg4uYzaa	no your ok better you feel it and it not numb, mine was numb when i would touch and it would feel really wierd kinda tingly but everyone is diffrent so your fine
seOx7cWaaa	Where i am the purple lid is parents choice(im pretty sure) i don't use it, i use good start and ive used simalic.. but it runs about 13 bucks for a can of Good start/simialc.. parents choice is prob like 6 bucks cheaper|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	The one I use has a purple label, it's Similac Alimentum.  For a bottle of Ready to Feed it's $9.63, and a small can, the 12.9 ounce is $27.99.  I've never seen any bigger cans.  This is special formula though so it's more expensive, and I'm not sure it it's the one your talking about, but it has a purple label.
b11c4fce7a6b25cdfef56f6a94f56684aa	yes she could still be pregnant ,you are not immune to infections when pregnant .It would not delay the test result.test again in a few days ..|`|T48smu01aa	Not really...Or I wouldn't think anyways....when I found out I was pregnant I had a bacterial infection you can usually be more prone to getting them while pregnant....she should have asked for a blood est..did she?? if not go back and get a blood test .<br>  Good luck!|`|xq7S9H5Raa	That would not interfere with her being pregnant, but would have to be taken care of because it can cause miscarriage and also passed on to the growing fetus.
hSeAx5cCaa	Yes, more than likely she will. Children have all sorts of obstacles with the linguistic input they get from adults (whether it's speech problems in the adults, problems with hearing from ear infections, or whatever) and the vast majority master language with few problems. Think about the speech that even a child with normally speaking parents hears...we stumble over words, stop and change what we're saying mid-sentence, run words together, get interrupted, etc. Yet children hear all that and still manage to learn to speak well. Language is innate, meaning that people are wired to master it. Also, if their child seems like she makes mistakes, don't worry, all kids do. If you want to learn more about the stages of development so that you can see how their child fits, look up information on child language development. It's actually very interesting.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Of course she can learn to speak properly. At some time she will realize that her parents don't talk like people around them or on tv. If she does happen to pick up speech patterns from her parents which hamper her ability to get her ideas across to other people, the school can set her up with speech therapy (free through the school system) to get her on the right tract.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	my mother slurs her words due to trauma to her head and i'm aright, well i was until i got run over, now i have a slight stutter and slur my words a bit
KPYQwyeraa	act like you are taking the pill but dont really take it as long as he knows you ARE NOT using a birth control method be smart i think you should take it thogh|`|wdvPCU7Taa	Just take it. What's the worst that can happen? Besides, if the condom breaks, you have back-up.|`|W7UpXXQGaa	can you explain why you dont want to get on birth control?<br>  <br>  do want a chance to get pregnant?<br>  <br>  id say use the birth control there is nothing wrong with it|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Condoms aren't very effective when used without a back-up method.  Why don't you want to go on the pill?  It seems that your guardian knows you are having sex, and just wants to try to help prevent an unplanned pregnancy.  You should really go on the pill (and continue to use condoms) if you are going to be having sex.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	Birth control is totally worth it, use the low dose hormones and you won't even know you are on it.  If the condom breaks and you are ovulatiing whats your backup?|`|MZMwJwDGaa	just do it or stop having sex.<br>  even the pill isn't 100% effective|`|lVaC4Ga4aa	just use condoms<br>  *^*|`|g9TxgMlwaa	I think you should. Get on birth control like either the depo provera, or and IUD that way you don't have to worry about it.  Being with someone for a certain amount of time doesn't make you immune from getting pregnant. Why don't you want to be on birth control? Having a baby is not all fun and games. I hope you realize that. It won't make your boyfriend love you more, Kids are expensive. Both financially, mentally and physically. Definitely get on Birth Control now. You;ll be glad in the long run.|`|K5F9T4vNaa	i take it and i know its such a pain, because you need to take it daily at the same time and if you miss one or two its wtf. but honestly i think you should because having to be nervous every month guessing what if is really not worth it.  even tthough its a pain its really a hell of alot worth it.  it saves alot of stress, and is a good eliminator of any unwanted problems that could occur.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	There's no reason you shouldn't get on it...it's not going to hurt you, the only reason you shouldn't is if your trying to get pregnant...it's not a big deal get on birth control...your gardian is right, expecially if your living in his/her roof & there paying the bills..,|`|6pLLPdPwaa	I think you should really think about it. If you are young enough to have a guardian, then you are too young to be having a baby.|`|eV6MHADQaa	condoms break and my son was born w/ birth control i say do both so you can make it to collage or at least tech school|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	do u want a baby???<br>  comdons brake and sometimes come off. and what about if u get in the mood and dont end up using one???<br>  be safe and use birth control|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Go on it. Trust me.|`|lfKEHk66aa	1. Your gaurdian is smart. If you are sexually active you should get birth control. Condoms can break, and after that there is nothing you can do to stop from getting pregnant. So if you do get birth control you should still use a condom when having sex just in case. It is better to be safe then sorry so i recomend you do use birth control.<br>  <br>  2. If you have made up your mind about not using birth control, then you have to trick your gaurdian into thinking you are on birth control. Tell them that you are taking the pill. Fake it how ever you want. If they want to ever see you take the pill, you can take the real thing right in front of them. Birth control only works if it is taken consistently. Accept the pill from your gaurdian and take a pill out of the package and throw it out each time you are supposed to be swallowing one.(flush it down the toilet, or get rid of it at school) If you get pregnant just say the birth control didn't work. <br>  <br>  I really hope you do use birth control, or at least try it for a little bit. Ask a doctor about the best kind to use if you are unsure. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to use it but you can make your own decisions.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|sa456bqBaa	I understand where you are coming from.  I  was forced to be on birth control but i got lucky and my body didn't handle it well. I bleed for like a month and a half straight. <br>  <br>  Where are you from? because in texas at 17 you can make your own decisions and your gaurdian can not tell you to be on it.<br>  <br>  If you absoulutly have to ask them to put you on the pill and then just pretend to take it and throw it away. if they try to put you on the shot just tell them some of your friends gained wait using that method or somthing. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|GWveqx61aa	well what are you going to do if the condom breaks and you get pregnant, if you are ready to be a mom and a dad then dont do the birth control but if you are not ready, \then do the birth control, its only in case, and if i wasnt able to take care of an oops baby id go on the pill, i am againts killing babies, but  prevention is ok, good luck|`|KNpgI5hjaa	Go on birthcontrol.<br>  Your lucky your gardian is suggesting it.<br>  Its better, cause something can happen to you.<br>  The condom can break, or even worse.<br>  But whatever happens you'd be on birth control. <br>  Birth control makes it so its a less chance of having a baby.<br>  <br>  I want to be on birth control, But Im afraid my mom is gonna find out about me and my boyfriend.<br>  Your luckky.<br>  take the chance.<br>  Trust me ;]|`|KA4DdLrOaa	I think you should go on it, if you want to see your boyfriend! haha :)<br>  <br>  It really isn't bad, it makes periods lighter, reduces cramps, and got rid of my acne. <br>  Not to mention, it is more effective than condoms, if used correctly.<br>  You just gotta remember to take it everyday! which isn't too difficult if you just make it part of either your get-ready routine or before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  *if STD's are an issue though, be sure to keep using condoms, becuse birth control doesn't protect you from those. <br>  <br>  hope this helps some what|`|K4k80oDGaa	I am a 21 year old single mom with twin boys. Take it from a pro. Get on BC. Its not going to hurt you, it only prevents pregnant. Oh and condoms don't always work. They break. Think of it like this, what are you and your boo going to do if you have a baby. You sound young so Im sure you have alot of stuff you wanna do in life. Think about the future not just right now. Be smart and get on the pill.|`|ReDarchbaa	Well if you really don't want to take it or go on it..than at least get it and pretend you are taking it.<br>  <br>  I mean,bc is a good thing to be on as well as condoms because they can break. There are also tons of different bc's out there. Just review all of your choices before deciding. In the end its all up to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|LDEa6yDcaa	SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK CONDOMS ARE 100 PERCENT SURE!<br>  DON'T BE A FOOL!<br>  YOU NEED TO STILL USE THE CONDOMS ALONG WITH BIRTH CONTROL. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU NEED A CHILD RIGHT NOW AND MAYBE NEVER.<br>  I AM A GUARDIAN MYSELF AND I CAN TELL YOU, IT IS A LOT OF WORK AND I SURE COULD NOT TAKE ON ANOTHER RESPONIBILITY SUCH AS A CHILD!<br>  I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND HARSH HOWEVER, QUIT BEING SELFISH AND GROW UP! IF YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE SEX THEN YOU SHOULD BE OLD ENOUGH TO PREVENT SOME CHILD FROM COMING INTO THE WORLD THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU ARE CAPABLE OF THIS.<br>  THE DJ MAN SAID THAT, AND STICKS TO WHAT HE SAYS|`|nRn8kEyRaa	Unless you want a chance to get pregnant I think you should reconsider, the pill is harmless and can actually help regulate your period. It is a very mature thing to do.|`|FUBNkpwSaa	act like you're okay with it and just dont take it. <br>  but you could and MAY get pregnant so just be prepared to take responsibility for your decisions.<br>  Goodluck!|`|JJt2gVS7aa	the more the better|`|43yT9vnEaa	Why don't you want to get on it? It's just extra protection...
AA10300801	I told my boyfriend that he was the one for me and that I didn't want to wait forever when I had been with him for about 6 months.  (Maybe not as directly, but I made it clear).  He proposed (surprise) when we had been together for another year after that.  I didn't know that we would end up together until that point because you just can't until there's a ring on your finger.  He knew what I wanted and he said that he was feeling the same way, but he wasn't in any hurry.  Mind you, I was 25 and he was 32...and he still wasn' t in a hurry.  Oh, and I REALLY had to work for his affection.  For the longest time I wasn't even SURE he liked me as a girlfriend because he didn't go out of his way to impress me or lavish attention on me.  Now that we are married, he impresses me daily just being a great husband.<br>  <br>  I focused on what was best for my life - school and career - and he eventually decided to get on board.  Its really all you can do.  If you sacrifice anything for this guy, he will likely leave for someone with more going on.  Do what makes you feel good, and he will want to be a part of it.  Just realize that 22 is really young for a guy to commit.  I wish you the best!|`|Jswomud7aa	Honey, you have way bigger things to focus on in your life than a relationship. You should be worried more about finishing school and succeeding there then in a relationship with a very young boy.<br>  <br>  Men need some time to develop and statistics show that people who get married before the age of 25 have an 80% chance to divorce. The chance of divorce goes higher if they dated for less than 2 years... Not what I say, what the statistics say.<br>  <br>  It's great to have fun with someone you enjoy, to go out and spend time with them, but really, marriage should be far from your mind at this point in your life. You should focus on your education and preparing a good foundation for your FUTURE family|`|YLXpwqceaa	My husband and I just knew we'd marry.  We dated for 4 months before he proposed.  I definitely wasn't expecting it that soon, but we did talk about marriage several times.  We were both in college at the time, he had a job, and I didn't.  We were engaged a year and a half before getting married.  We've had our obstacles, we took a break twice (for a week) to see if it was really what we wanted, and we always came back to each other. We talked everyday unless he was camping and out of town.  But we spent maybe a week apart since we've met.  We've been married for two years now.<br>  <br>  If you mention marriage, does he seem interested in talking about it, or does he push the matter aside.  If he's not ready, but tells you openly and honestly, then he may have thought about it with you, but just not too in depth.  It's not a good sign if they say they will never get married or never ever talk about it with you.  That might not be in the right direction.<br>  <br>  If you have talked about it, then examine what was said.  If you haven't, then my advice would be to ask him what his thoughts are.  Ask him if he's ever considered it with you.  If you are on the same page as far as not getting married for awhile tell him that, that way he knows your not pushing for now.  And if you agree with what he says, then you know you're on a good road together.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	When I met my future husband, I actually wasn't head over heels in love with him the way some people are.  I thought he was cute and funny and a nice guy, but was nowhere near the top of my list as far as potential boyfriends went.  We were just friends first.  Then, just one day, I realized I liked him.  We kept hanging out and eventually started dating.  About a month into it, I have a diary entry (I was very young at the time) that read, "This is the kind of guy I want to marry someday".  lol<br>  <br>  We had been together as a couple for a year when we first discussed marriage, just asking what the other wanted and how we felt about marriage.  We dated for a year and a half before he proposed.  We had been friends for 6 months prior to dating though, so it was about 2 years after we first met.  We weren't married until another year and a half later.<br>  <br>  I was NOT expecting it.  I mean, we both had discussed how we really felt like we were soul-mates and meant to be together, but we hadn't actually discussed when we wanted to potentially start that journey of our lives together.<br>  <br>  I NEVER had to work for his affection.  Not once.  If I ever felt like I did, then it wasn't meant to be.  Two people who are truly in love shouldn't have to 'work' for the other persons affection.  Don't get me wrong, relationships ARE hard work, but I just don't feel like a woman should have to do tons of extra stuff to win a man's affection.  I feel like that's where all the games start and I don't play games.  He needs to love me for me, period.<br>  <br>  No, we didn't call each other everyday.  I don't think its necessary.  You can be completely in love with someone and not have to spend every waking moment with them, thinking about them or talking to them.  Each person needs to be able to be their own person before entering into such a serious relationship.<br>  <br>  As for telling if marriage is the going to be the end result of your relationship..... there really isn't anyway to know until you're actually there.  You have to learn to relax and live in the moment.  These things aren't meant to be over-analyzed.  If its suppose to be, it will be.

AA10458750	WIC does not help with diapers. They will only supply the limited amount of formula per month. Lastly, they only help broke people(Not trying to insult anybody who has WIC but their income requirements are strict!) I would recommend that you buy a pack of diapers with each paycheck.Not so much Newborn size, but lots of size 1s and 2s. Also, try breastfeeding first before you decide on formula. If you don't mind doing it, it will save you lots of money!|`|QSodlfMraa	well if you make too much they not going to help you, and they do not cover for diapers|`|vuEyUbsgaa	In my state we have a pregnancy resource center that gives free baby stuff to pregnant girls before and after their pregnant. Maybe you could check to see if you have one over there in texas? And WIC does not cover diapers, just foods basically. Breastfeed because its cheaper and healthier for you and your baby too|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Breastfeeding will save you a lot of money, formula is expensive.<br>  <br>  Diapers, you can buy them with coupons or go somehwere like Costco and buy the generic kind.|`|p2J1KcNRaa	Well just so you know wic does not cover diapers.

MHOxPs8Oaa	Think about adoption. Unless, you think you can get your place to live, take care of a baby and that means clothe it, feed it, find babysitters or daycare, take care of it financially, etc.. Also, your mom shouldn't support you finacially if you do decide to keep it.  Your mom and her mom have the choice to kick you out if they want, but your mom shouldn't be able to tell her to have an abortion.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	It's not your mother's baby, it's YOURS<br>  You do what you and your gf want.

It's a total shock to find out that your child is going to be an unmarried parent.Your mother's first reaction is that she doesn't want your life to change. That's why she wants your girlfriend to have an abortion. When she's had time to think it over, she will realize that your lives have already changed, and the best thing she can do is to support you.   No matter how she feels during the pregnancy, I'm sure she will come around when she sees her grandchild.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you're both adults and it seems like you have the means to support yourselves and a child.  If necessary, find an apartment. Go to social services and find out what programs are available to help you financially - there is a lot of help out there for those who need it.  The decision about what to do should be between you and your girlfriend. Consider all your options and what you want to do with the rest of your life.  Don't let your parents influence you.  This is not about them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  You can do it.|`|hChhOhOGaa	You have an enormous decision to make.  Both of YOU.  Not your parents, not her parents.  It's not like you are under 18.  If you are opposed to abortion then don't do it.  Doing something to make another person happy, even if they are your parents is wrong.  You both have jobs and cars, it can be done.  How much are you willing to sacrifice?

She has NO right to want your GF to have an abortion.  You and your gf are adult enough to have jobs, work, and have cars...see what you can do about getting your own place, and starting a life together.  There is public assistance available.  I am not usually an advocate of telling people to get public assistance, but since you BOTH are trying to better yourselves through education, and you both have jobs, it shows you would not be using "the system" long term, just to get you through this period in life.  If your mom is so serious about her convictions, then so be it....she will come around in time- maybe.  So, be supportive of your gf and think of yourselves as a team now, not as so and so's son or daughter....you have jumped into adulthood!  Embrace it and move forward in a positive way.  Good luck!|`|I8nIewQHaa	This is a difficult situation but you did the right thing by telling your mother. I really hate it when parents react that way. Your not ruining you life by having a child. Yes it may not be the right time... but really when is the right time to have a child!? Even with parents that are ready with plenty of money. It was very wrong of your mother to say your GF should an abortion that is none of her business to even say that. If you feel the right thing is to keep it and your GF thinks so too then that's all that matters. You seem to have things a little put together with having jobs and getting an education. Just take things one day at a time and make a plan for the future. Good Luck!|`|J2gBU0NDaa	You had your fun, and was not careful at all, or the rubber broke.  Either way you are on a life long journey.  You need to decide what are your priorities are.  Take your parents at their word for now, meaning assume you will not get any help from them, if you keep the baby.  That means you 2 will have to do things on your own.  You both work, and you will need every penny, just to survive.  Rent will cost you with utilities 700-1000. a month.  Food eating at home at least 300 a month. Then you have to add 2 car payments, 2 insurances, and gas, and maintenance for 2 cars.  I do not know how much each car payment is, but I would guess 250-300 each.  Gas 120-150 a month each.  Insurance 75-100 a month each.  Baby stuff, food, diapers, other clothes, vaccines, day care, about 800-1000 a month.  Not counting school expenses.  That is 2700-3300 a month.  Now you can cut some of that down by buying some toys, baby clothes and furniture at the salvation army store.  Buying food at discount food stores like Dollar stores and Alde's.  Maybe you can work it out with each other to take care of the baby when the other is working, or at school. Maybe you could also find another couple, or single mom that you can work out taking care of each others kids while you are at work or school. Of course you can ask for help, for food stamps, and subsidizes housing. You could get up to 100 a week in food stamps, and as little as 300 to 500 off your rent.  You might also look into getting rid of one of the cars.  I commend you for wanting to give it a good shot.  You are more mature then most adults older then you.  <br>  <br>  Now that I gave you the dirty, hard work, you most likely have to do, decide what you want to do.   Now if you still willing to give it a try, know you will most likely get help from your parents after a while.  Eventually your parents will get over the disappointment of working so hard to make life easier for you.  Both your parents as you will sacrificed to give you chances to even be able to go to college.  I am sure you know how hard it is to go to college, without taking care of a baby.  Both your parents are hurt, and feel like somehow they failed.  Now you will have to work as hard as they did raising you.  Once they get over the disappointment, they will come running to love that child of yours, their grandchild.  Good luck.  And most of all sacrifice what ever you two can to stay in school.|`|sbeoF50gaa	Hrm where to start... Start looking for a place to live on your own. Both of you have jobs, have cars, you have all the means you need to get out on ur own. Being a parent IS hard and VERY expensive, but if you want to keep your baby you'll make it work. If you decide not to keep the baby, I"d say adoption.. I don't believe in abortion and I'm not sure why your mother does? It sounds like she's going by the bible on "needing to be married first" but is ok with killing your child? How would your famliy feel about killing the baby? But like I said I'd find urself a place to live. You don't have to have a 2 bedroom place. I'm sure you can find somewhere you can afford. You are old enough to fend for yourself. I was 18 when I have my daughter. I'm doing just fine.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Don't get an abortion, you are both old enough to have a kid and you both have jobs. Get an apartment, and have the baby. Your mother needs to get some sense knocked into her, don't let your mother change your gfs mind. You are basically finically ok to have a baby, and i think you both can get through it. Get an apartment before you tell her mom.|`|22pSDUy0aa	Your both old enough to have a child, its not like your in high school anymore. Having an abortion can haunt a woman forever, and if parents wont be supportive, just let them be mad. They will get over it, and no grandparent can resist a grandchild.

I think if this is what you guys really want and think you can handle with school and work then go for it!
9OsjdsrZaa	Snacks and meals for a 1 year old can be tricky...because they can be so picky.<br>  <br>  Each of my children at that age loved homemade mac and cheese.<br>  <br>  Cook desired amount of elbow macaroni as printed on box.<br>  In a casserole dish mix with 1/2 amount of cheese and 1/2 amount of milk.  For example...if you cook 1 cup of pasta, mix in the casserole dish 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and a 1/2 cup of milk.  Bake in the oven 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. (remember that a 1 year old may need their noodles cooked to a very soft texture).<br>  <br>  They were also fans of :<br>  Boiled raisins.  I know that sounds odd, but they loved the taste of raisins, but the texture was too tough.  Putting them in a little water and steaming them for a minute softens the skin enough to make them easy to gum.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	check this site out, i love it!<br>  <br>  <br>  one of my LO's favorites is sweet potato "fries"<br>  jsut peel & slice a fresh sweet potato into fries, drizzle with olive oil, & bake at 375F for about 10-15 min turning once, voila! you can sprinkle with cinnamon, too. they're yummy! even i like them :)|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	My one year niece loves cheese, turkey, chicken nuggets, sweet potatoes, goldfish crackers, yogurt melts, green beans, bananas, pumpkin (really any squash), butternut squash ravioli, cereal bars, noodles, etc. Just whatever we are eating in smaller bites and portions.|`|nJQr2oOcaa	BREAKFAST:<br>  eggs (1 scrambled)<br>  waffle (1 regular size or 2 mini ones)<br>  pancakes (1 regular size or 2 small ones)<br>  oatmeal (1 packet)<br>  bowl of cereal with milk<br>  -all served with a fruit (i do banana or apple in the morning)<br>  -served with milk<br>  <br>  SNACKS:<br>  served with juice<br>  -graham cracker (1)<br>  -nilla wafers (4 or 5)<br>  -pretzels (5 or 6)<br>  -applesauce<br>  -cheese and cracker crackers<br>  -rice cake crisps (by quaker, really good!)(4 or 5)<br>  -all served with a fruit (peaches, strawberries, grapes, cantaloupe)<br>  <br>  LUNCH:<br>  -grilled cheese (half a sandwich)<br>  -3 or 4 chicken nuggets<br>  -mac and cheese<br>  -yogurt<br>  -sliced deli meat (turkey or bologna only)<br>  served with water and a fruit or veggie<br>  <br>  DINNER:<br>  -hamburger<br>  -rotisserie chicken<br>  -baked chicken (coat thin sliced chicken breasts in Italian dressing, cover with bread crumbs, bake @350 degrees)<br>  -beef stew, easy to make and very healthy!  message me for recipe!<br>  -pasta with meatball and sauce (a little)<br>  -pizza (occasionally 1/2 a slice is enough with other sides)<br>  served with water<br>  served with rice and a veggie, or potato and a veggie<br>  some veggie favs i see are:<br>  -carrots, string beans, asparagus, peas, broccoli, zucchini<br>  <br>  DESSERT:<br>  -ice cream (i prefer peach or strawberry or vanilla flavors)<br>  -frozen yogurt<br>  -100% juice no sugar added ice pops<br>  -fruit<br>  -carrot cake<br>  <br>  <br>  try to limit juice to one or two cups a day, one milk in the morning and once at night, at least 4 or 5 cups of water.<br>  make sure your juice is 100% juice.<br>  *Mott's make a juice called Mott s for Tots which is watered down 100% juice with vitamins, comes in several flavors, i only buy that.*<br>  make sure no foods have fake sugar like sucralose or aspartame.<br>  make sure any prepared foods u buy, like mac n cheese doesn't have more than 400 mg of sodium per serving.<br>  make sure no foods contain too much sodium per serving or high fructose corn syrup!|`|AA10120592	<a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Kid-Friendly-Veggie-Muffins-128256" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Kid-Friendly-V...</a>  my girls love these. and they're healthy for them, which is always nice.|`|OUWTvtVVaa	Fruit shake, it's fast, taste good, and nourishing.|`|Z3Ai44Jcaa	Cheerios is alwayds a good choice.

ENANtueuaa	I don't agree with him making your son call his step mom, mom. You're his mom, and i understand why you would feel hurt. He should use "mommy ann" or whatever her name is. As for showering together, it's perfectly normal, that's his father. He might be at height level with his privates, but i can guaranty your son isn't sitting there starring at it, besides, they do have the same parts. Just like a mom undressing in front of her 3 year old daugher...nothing wrong with that either. I realize that he rarely sees his father, and i don't know why that is, because i'm not there to see the situation, but the point is...it's still his father. You can't make the comparrison about you not showering with your friends child...it's completely different. I'm assuming he's letting him sleep in the bed with him because he rarely sees him, even if it is his choice to only see him every few months, but i feel like it's just a way of bonding. I understand that you have a routine, but spending a week at dads every few months wont throw him off completely when he's at home with you. It might take a few days for him to adjust again, but that's perfectly normal. Sometimes dads who don't see their children a lot like to spend more time just enjoying the company of the child, than actually setting a routine or discpiling them. That's what my dad always did...my dad and mom where divorced. I don't think it's right AT ALL, but it's what happens! YOU are the main caregivier of your child, remember that! He will realize that as he gets older, don't worry! Let dad do what dad does for his 1 week, and try not to stress about it. You can't change the way they do things, so you're going to just wear yourself ouit thinking about it! He's fine :) Really!<br>  <br>  Also, i want to add..don't force him to take his son! If he doesn't wanna "man up" and take care of his responsibilities, then htat's his choice. It seems like all it does is stress you out when he's with him anyway, so i can't figure out why you'd even ask him to take him. If he doesn't wanna be a part of your sons life, and has other priorities, then that's the way it's going to be! Like i said before...your son will realize who the permanent parent is as he gets older. The one who was there when he was sick, or who took him to the doctor, or who played with for hours on end...and that's YOU! I know it's hard, but please stop stressing about this :)|`|S2E7lW10aa	well how old is your son?<br>  the thing is that if your son is older than 4 than yes it would be to old and the bed thing is ok since he probably like sit more than sleeping by himself|`|BRT2teSqaa	Youre overreacting he is 3!!  It's quick and convenient.  We stopped at 4 and a half.|`|1KrxpLe7aa	depends, how old is he??|`|8NJM0NVvaa	My daughter still showers with me sometimes if we are in a hurry.  She is 4.  I do not see a problem with him showering with his dad or sleeping in the same bed as his dad and step mom.  My daughter slept in the same bed as my husband (her step-father that she calls "daddy") and me until I was close to delivering her brother last month.  As far as the him calling her "mom" thing, if it is something that he is doing on his own then I think it is fine but if he is being forced to or being told that he has to then there is a problem there.|`|FEhmNTL2aa	You seem like a very unhappy person.  The kid is 3 and a boy, so no it's not inappropriate to shower with his father. I wouldn't suggest that you shower with him though, being a woman and all.  He sleeps with his dad and wife?  I don't want me kids sleeping with me simply because I don't want it to be a habit, not because it's inappropriate or anything.  You should be happy they love him.  It sounds like the wife loves him, which you should be happy for.  If she was "jealous" of the relationship she'd exclude the little boy often.  Seems to me like you need to worry about other more important issues and let dad have his time with his son.  Don't be a nag to him, nothing worse than an ex that's always got to be in your business.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT!  You say you don't nag and then you write  "I'm the one who makes my ex come home and see his son. Now that he's remarried (for 3 months now) he's seen even less of him because the new wife has other priorities..."  Don't force a man to be father!  If my kids father didn't want to be around, I'd leave it alone.  I will never force anyone to see my children, people should be in their lives because they love them and want to be.  <br>  <br>  And I'm sorry to inform you that when parents have children and they split up, issues arise with the children.  Such as, you can't "make" your ex make the child sleep in a certain place, your ex can't make you do certain things when you have the child.|`|QPMpGjLRaa	i dont think ur over reacting if it was my child i would maybe look into some counciling to  see if he will tell them anything or talk to ur ex|`|rHDWxzDraa	i think you are overreacting. unless of course you you have reason to believe that something else may be going on. there is nothing wrong with you husband being naked in front of his son, its natural and normal. just make sure you son doesn't feel wierd about it. when your son dosent wait to shower with dad anymore then that is the time he is too old for it.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	So what if she's having him call her mom.  Lots of kids call their step parent mom and dad.  I know she isn't his step mom, but they have been together for a year now. I would talk to the dad about having his own bed and bath time for him though.  He doesn't need to be seeing his dad's privates although, it isn't that bad. They are both boys even though one is bigger than the other. I just saw you say he is 3 so it isn't completely wrong that they share a bed or shower, but it isn't that great either. I don't really think it's worth bringing up at the court, but just to the father.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oops I didn't even notice you said wife not girlfriend, but she is his step mom, and she wants him to call her mom, that is her right as a step mom. Don't over react about that one.  It is completely fine. My niece calls my brother her dad and the mom doesn't even live with him.  My dad is my brother's step dad and he has called him dad since he was 5.  Many many many children call their step parents mom and dad it is fine.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"Is it wrong of me to be upset that my son is eye height at my ex's privates and I feel it's inappropriate?"<br>  <br>  Yeah. You may feel it's inappropriate, but...well, whatever. It's not. Have you any idea what male locker rooms are like? Your son will be in one eventually. He will see adult penises.<br>  <br>  Totally appropriate -- and quite nice, if you ask me -- for a three-year-old tot to shower with Daddy. I can't imagine why this bothers you other than that you simply don't like your ex.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I would say age 3<br>  <br>  I would bring it up in court, that is just......its not sitting well with me, always showering with his father is a little on the creepy side,and he should really have his own bed over at his dads house, but the sleeping in the same bed with him and his wife is not to bad, and its really up to your son if he wants to call her mom or not.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Oh stop it!  Geez, you act like your son's dad is some sort of pedophile.  God, it's his FATHER.  <br>  <br>  Yea, go ahead and bring it up in court, and watch the reaction you get from the judge!!  Priceless!!|`|JduQHocdaa	Your not overreacting your ex is being a insensitive a**hole. He is doing all these things to piss you off.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	It's ok for him to shower with his Dad. They are both boys.<br>  <br>  The stepmom should not be called MOM, that is a big no no and he's probably doing it to spite you.<br>  <br>  If your ex has a bed for the boy, then he should sleep in his own bed. If there isn't a bed, then they need a roll away or mattress so the child will have his own bed.
FEg0PDdnaa	I have had 3 pregnancies. My first was a molar pregnancy where I got so sick I couldn't keep down water or even get out of bed.

tbeO3Lataa	You always want to start off with the least invasive and the most natural method. <br>  <br>  I would definitely start with having your water broken. This does not involve any medications, and it very natural. However, this is usually not done unless you have been in labor and are stuck at a certain amount of centimeters.<br>  <br>  After that, go with having your membranes swept. This can be done in your OB's office. Be warned, however, that this will produce intense menstrual cramping.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, then go for Pitocin. For a general rule, any medication to induce labor, I believe, should be a last resort.<br>  <br>  Getting closer, Ashley! E-mail with any updates or if you need to chat.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	u only get a c-section if somethg is wrong, they will most likely put u on pitocin and then they will break ur waters if they need to after couple of hours|`|MsipL0Mzaa	if you havent thinned out,dilated or lost your plug and you go in on pitocin you will be in for a long hard labor,that increases your chances of c section,because you become stressed and your baby can be under stress and cause lower heart rates for baby and higher heartrate for you...the longer the labor the higher chances.having your water broken can bring on hard contractions quickly.having your membranes stripped doesnt guarentee labor it irritates your cervix which may or maynot cause contractions......|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	All of them/none of them.  Induction that fails ends in C-section, and it can fail for a number of reasons.  It could fail because there was something wrong that was going to end in a c-section anyway.<br>  <br>  Or it could end in a c-section because once the waters are busted, and the baby hasn't come, and his heart rate drops and so forth, you've got to do something, you can't wind back the clock.<br>  <br>  If you must be induced, I recommend you look your doctor in the eye and say "what do you recommend?"  I just went straight on the drip.  Your doctor knows more than you do, and the books/internet info is terrifying, it all contradicts, and also a doctor who has watched the world go by ends up with hunches and gut feelings that can't be put in books.  Che sera sera.  C-sections aren't all that bad, actually, although you can't laugh for a while....<br>  <br>  :o)|`|smcWIZxPaa	i started on cervadil at 6pm on a monday night, slept overnight, was 2cm dialated in the morning.  two doses of cytotek (4 hours each) which dialated me to 4 cm, then pitocin which only brought me to 5/6cm.  water broke naturally at 5cm but the pitocin put stress on the babys heart so I had to have a c-section after 36 hours of labor.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	Get your membranes swept....I did, I was in labour 3hrs later and 7.5hrs after that I was holding my daughter|`|46ijdaH6aa	I was in the hospital at 11PM February 28th, 2005 ..

Pretty good labor I would say!!! lol They broke my water for me around 6PM. All deliveries don't end up in C-Section .. Either something goes wrong example .. Fast heart rate ..

uLdeIhHqaa	At the hospital.<br>  <br>  But, you need to specify to the Hospital if you are going to Breastfeed, or Formula-Feed. Because, if you dont tell them that you are going to breastfeed, they will give your child formula. <br>  <br>  Usually, its a few hours after the baby is born is when they can be fed. <br>  <br>  CONGRATS! AND GOOD LUCK!|`|ZWsIP0NBaa	Right away.  After I delivered each of my 3 children the nurses cleaned them off, checked them out and within about 45 minutes they were sucking away.  It does take a few days to get your milk in (if you are breast feeding) but the more you feed the quicker it comes.  Good luck to you!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	at the hospital if u breast feed they will have u feed the baby right away if ur going to bottle feed u can feed the baby after he has been checked and stuff|`|AA10441395	Immediately after birth!|`|ry0ZQvRUaa	You will get to feed your baby girl at the hospital! congratulations!|`|02714f74f20a85fd98454620daf8e793aa	if normal delivery as soon as the kid is born|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In the hospital, as soon as possible after they are born.  They need to eat every 2-3 hours.|`|68c6B8dRaa	My daughter was nursing while I was delivering the placenta...<br>  <br>  <br>  Useful:<br>  <br>  "Breastfeeding—Starting Out Right"<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/01starting_out_right.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/01startin...</a>|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I hope your planning on breastfeeding. It is the healthiest thing for both you and your baby. Google "benefits of breastfeeding" and you will see what I mean. You should feed the baby for the first time within an hour after she is born. Tell the nurses and midwives that you are planning on breastfeeding and they can help you get her latched on correctly. Your baby will need to eat every 1-3 hours for the first few months. Do some research on breastfeeding to get yourself ready and expect some challenges at first but it is so rewarding. You can always come on here if you are having trouble and need advice!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	usually within an hour of being born. the doctor will stitch and/or clean you up from delivery and your baby will be all cleaned up and swaddled in a blanket. then after about 5-10 minutes of one-on-one baby and parent time a nurse will come in and assist you with your firt feeding :) its so surrearl. good luck to you and congrats!!|`|RyYWzEZcaa	if your hospital is like mine you will do all the feedings.  Usually within the first hour after birth the baby will eat the first time.  My hospital had an optional nursery, but I kept my babies with me except for a few hours during the night.|`|qydwwbPiaa	you will get to feed her at the hospital.<br>  <br>  good luck. & congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
RKcwfrGOaa	Yes, I am outraged that people believe women should have the 'right' to deprive their children of a family and their partners of their children.  Apparently, women are more equal than babies and fathers?  It's just a sign of the complete breakdown of the education system in America.  Abortion is a reproductive right.  Once the baby is born, the reproduction is over.  The child is able to survive without the care of its mother, and if its mother refuses to provide continued care, she sure as heck should not be allowed to force every other member of the child's family to abandon it.  The child has just as much right to the care and affection of its family as the mother does.  <br>  <br>  Of course, the father shouldn't get special privileges, either.|`|2wyDALHgaa	When both parents are known or both parents are involved it is a choice to be made by both.  A woman just cannot place a baby for adoption without the fathers consent.  Of course, if the mother does not consent she is free to keep the baby.  At the same time, if the father does not consent and the mother wants to place it for adoption then HE can keep the baby if he wishes.  He cannot compel the woman to keep the baby any more then she can compel him to keep it.  <br>  <br>  The problem comes when the mother wants to place the baby and the father does not to place it but is unwilling to keep it himself.  You (not YOU personally, but anyone) can't have it both ways.  Who ever doesn't want to place the baby is always free to keep it themselves.|`|UrAeAYRFaa	I wish the child had a choice, I don't believe in<br>  ownership, but back to reality.

u94HOVz7aa	it's probably from the switching.  when i switched my son from regular simiac advanced to similac isomil advance it took him 3 weeks for his body to adjust and accept it fully.  you shouldn't switch more than once a week.  it takes a full week to get use to a new type of formula is what my son's dr. said. and this week is just a guideline some babies take longer.  and switching (even back to something he had before) is an adjustment and can be hard on his little stomach.   powder and liquid shouldnt make a difference.  The only thing i notice when i switch between powder and liquid concentrate is that my son looks like he is chewing the powder (i dont think its mixing as smooth as the liquid concentrate).  other than that i use what evers on sale when my wic isnt enough i just stick to the same type/brand of formula.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I agree with the other answerer.  I do not think there is a real difference btw regular advance and early shield.   But, I would say to test your hypothesis by going back to the regular Similac Advance, using the powder form if that is what you used to use.  Then try the Similac Advance jug.  Then try the Early Shield powder, then the jug. This way you eliminate all of the variables that could be causing the discomfort. <br>  <br>  I do not think it is colic.  Colic usually starts at about 6 weeks of age, peaks at 12 weeks and is gone entirely by 4 months, at which point the digestive system matures.<br>  <br>  It is always, always possible that something else is irritating your baby.  Either gas, teeth, a growth spurt, etc.  He may be getting sick, or is cranky, or whatever.  But try to get to the bottom of the formula issue.  :)|`|TfzXJcvuaa	I am currently having the same issue. My son was exclusively breastfed for five months and then I started supplementing with formula. He was very picky and would only take the Similac Early Shield in the ready to use. The wic program where i live only does Enfamil so I tried him on that but he was doing the same thing as your baby. The only real difference in the regular and the early shield is the prebiotics so it should not affect the taste but the ready to use has a different taste than the powder. It may be the reason that he is refusing the powder because he likes the taste of the liquid better.You should talk to your dr. about switching.

It is ok that you have him in the bed but ONLY as long as you know that he is there and you give him enough room. If you are waking up to feed him and don't even know he is there than you could roll over on him.|`|chiFCUC5aa	Is he in his own room yet? how many times does he wake up during the night? at 7 months my son started waking up alot and by 8 months he was waking every hour it was taking a toll on me. We decided to let him cry for a few minutes each night starting with 2 and the next night 3 and by the 4th night he was falling asleep on his own and staying asleep through the entire night. My pediatrician strongly suggested we try the cry it out thing, he told me that at 6 months babies can go through the night without eating and you start bad habits by feeding them...then they automatically wake up to eat every night. He also said that although its really hard to do its worth the years of healthy sleep habits...and to be honest it was amazing being able to sleep though the whole night. i felt so refreshed during the day. <br>  we have a rule that if it there is light coming in the window then he can come in our bed..that way he wont start waking up as he gets older and run into our room at all hours of the night. I do think its better for them to be in their own cribs and safer too....and if you dont even remember waking up then it sounds like you are sleep deprived<br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck|`|ZXDKEe5laa	at 7 month old he shouldn't be getting up to eat maybe if you aren't feeding him baby food you should start so he wont be hungry at night or feed him more during the day and you should NOT put him in your bed he could fall out and injury his self or yes you could roll on him and he could stop breathing the crib or playpen is the safest place.|`|68c6B8dRaa	That's normal for mothers -- only being marginally aware of nighttime nursings -- and the same thing that allows you to nod back off and forget it is also the same thing that keeps you conscious enough to not roll over and squish him.

uMIvRRjoaa	I've btdt- the tips below REALLY helped me. I think I got bit twice- once when my daughter got her first 2 teeth, and then when she got her 1 yr molars. There were about 9 months in between. You can get thtrough this, just like you got through learning to nurse in the first place. :-)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/biting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/older-baby/bi...</a><br>  Will I need to wean when baby gets teeth?<br>  Many people think that when baby gets teeth and has the ability to bite, then the nursing relationship has ended and it's time to wean. Not true! If your baby is nursing properly, then you should not feel teeth, even if baby has a mouthful of them. And keep in mind that it's physically impossible for baby to nurse and bite at the same time, because the tongue covers the bottom teeth/gum when baby is nursing. <br>  <br>  Some babies never bite, but biting is a behavior that most babies do try, usually when they are teething. Rest assured that biting can be stopped with a little persistence on the mother's part. Biting is, for the vast majority of moms, a temporary issue that only lasts a few days to a couple of weeks. <br>  <br>  All babies are different, so you may need to try several different things before you find something that works for you. What works for you will depend on your baby's age, temperament and personality. <br>  <br>  Many mothers have gotten through this stage and gone on to give their babies the wonderful benefits of breastfeeding for weeks, months, and even years afterward. <br>  <br>  Ways to PREVENT biting<br>  Biting at the end of a nursing session: Biting often takes place at the end of a nursing session when baby is getting bored and is no longer hungry. If you start to have a biting problem, watch for signs of boredom, and take baby from the breast before the biting starts. Also, watch for tension in baby's jaw before he starts to bite down. He may also pull his tongue back from it's normal position over the lower gum/teeth. <br>  <br>  <br>  When baby is teething: Biting can also be brought on by teething. If baby seems to be teething rather than wanting to nurse, offer her a teething toy or something cold to bite (instead of you). Offer baby a teething toy after a bite or "near miss." When you do this, tell her, "This is for biting. Be gentle when you nurse." See also these comfort measures for teething. <br>  <br>  When my oldest was teething, I could tell whether my baby felt like biting or nursing by offering her a finger (careful!) or a toy before nursing - she would either suck or bite. <br>  <br>  <br>  Biting at the beginning of a nursing session: If baby is biting at the beginning of a nursing session, make sure baby opens wide when latching on. If your teething baby is biting at the beginning of a nursing session, try giving her a teething toy or something cold to chew on before nursing. Praise baby when she latches on correctly, without biting. <br>  <br>  <br>  Distracted baby: When baby is distracted, don't force a nursing. If he's wriggling, rolling, or pushing against you with his arms, he may not be hungry or interested in nursing. Try lying down with him in a quiet room, walking or rocking. See also these tips for nursing distracted babies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Biting for attention: Focus your attention on your baby while nursing, if you're having a problem with biting. Some older babies will bite for attention. Paying attention will also help you to be aware of when baby is about to bite. <br>  Use positive reinforcement and praise for good latch on and careful unlatching. Even the youngest babies can learn to nurse properly when mom uses gentle encouragement.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  What do I do if baby bites me?<br>  If baby bites, it can be very effective to calmly remove baby from the breast and say nothing (or perhaps make a calm comment like "oh? don't want to nurse right now?"), then end the nursing session for a bit. <br>  <br>  Stopping the nursing session is generally the most effective way to teach baby that nursing and biting do not go together. Once baby lets go, remove her from the breast for a bit - it may be a few seconds or a few minutes (this is something where you'll need to gauge your own baby's reaction). If baby is teething (which is often the cause of biting), this is a good time to hand baby something cold to chew on, a teething toy, etc. You might tell baby something along the lines of, "if you want to bite, we're not nursing." If baby really wants to keep nursing, she may get upset when you end the nursing session, at which point you can wait a few moments then give baby another chance to nurse. If baby is not interested in nursing, she might fuss a few seconds but then go on to something else. <br>  <br>  If baby bites, it's not a good idea to scream or yell on purpose as a method to stop biting -- there are better ways to teach baby not to bite. Sometimes, of course, it's impossible not to yell in pain if baby catches you by surprise and/or bites hard. Sometimes yelling does stop baby from biting again; however, some babies think it's so funny that they continue to bite for the reaction, a|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	I'd refuse to feed him with my nipples while he does that. If he does it just set him down and give him the bottle instead of the nipple.

Don't give people thumbs down just because its not your answer. That is very annoying and immature. And A lactation counselor is nothing. Its like being registered for CPR. Its only a 40 hour course.|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	A baby can't bite when they are actively nursing, so unlatch him when he seems to be finished.  Make sure you don't get lazy with your latch during the feed; sometimes baby can slip further away from your breast.  Make sure you keep him close.  IF you feel him biting or gumming, resist the urge to pull him away or off; remember to draw him in closer and unlatch him by breaking the suction FIRST.<br>  <br>  I nursed my daugher until she was four and a half when she self-weaned, and biting and teeth were rarely an issue, and it wasn't so much about teaching HER to not bite, but in training ME to recognize the circumstance where she might bite (ie lazy latch, finished and not sucking) and training myself how to react (ie pulling her closer rather than pulling her off).  The biggest problem I had with biting was actually when she thought she'd nurse with spaghetti still in her mouth, but that was more like chewing than biting and with a much older baby!|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	The best thing to do is to make him know that what he is doing needs to stop. So when you breastfeed pay close attention to his sucking pattern and as soon as you notice him biting immediately say no loudly and then take him off the breast. Wait a couple minutes then return him to the breast. You should only need to do this a couple of times before he gets the idea that I can not bite the nipple that feeds me|`|rdKuvxYJaa	he is to young for him to understand a scolding from you and at 7 months it is time to start winging him off the breast by using a bottle and nipple that is designed just like the breast and you pumping. you will still be active in your breastfeeding efforts but without the pain. good luck|`|TfzXJcvuaa	I am having the same problem.

From what I've seen here, plenty of parents still use spanking as a form of punishment/correction.  Overall, more people probably do it than you realize.  It's not as acceptable anymore, so my guess is plenty of parents have done it even if not regularly, but are afraid to say they have.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Because it is not up to you, it is up to the parent. There is no set punishment for every child out there.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	it is used ask JIM he will likely answer this question ...his dad still spanks him at 17 ....im not advocating that im just saying yes it is still used indeed ,

bmrQQOJjaa	I don't know about the CM but I do know that a few days before I got my positive pregnancy test I had mild cramps like I was going to get my period. Especally when I would stand up and go to the bathroom. My doctor said it was normal to get cramps like that. Maybe you are already pregnant and it is just to soon to take a test. I would just wait it out.|`|GWveqx61aa	all depends on your body and hormones, but some woman experience that cm where it feels like you peed when you are pregnant, good luck|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Truthfully, it varies from woman to woman and even cycle to cycle. You really can't go by that as an indicator for pregnancy. Just have to wait it out...best of luck!
AA12395149	Yes, it's normal, especially since salt is pretty good for settling a sour stomach too.  You still need to try and not go outside the recommended daily allowance of 3000 mg a day.  Try using different herbs and spices to add flavor to your food.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	It's possible your body is craving the sodium! And these cravings may/will be different with each pregnancy!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	yes i was dumping salting on my plate and dipping my finger in it and licking it lol|`|vBvgqjjsaa	Any form a craving is normal. I craved hot sauce on everything and I couldn't hold down my food unless I had hot sauce on it. Funny thing is I've never liked hot sauce before or after my pregnancy. So I would definitely say your craving for salt is normal.|`|4Uuehq2Faa	this pregnancy i have to have potatoes all the time, this means chips... with salt! i love chicken salt at the moment too, so yes i love salt right now! im trying to cut it down, but yes its common|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Yeah, all cravings are pretty normal durring pregnancy. Unless you want to eat paint lol.<br>  <br>  I remember for the longest time, I was snacking pickles and ketchup constantly. Eew.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	not sure if normal or even healthy but i did also...maybe we were lacking something in our diet..i crave crushed ice...heard that meant anemic...was tested and found to be anemic....maybe there something to it?!....|`|plI0WOrUaa	I had a month or two of craving salt.  I ate like a jar of pickles per week, and wanted anything salty.  You should limit your salt though.  Its bad for bloating and the baby.  I found that out and really really cut back.|`|AA11156322	I think so cause i remember eating salt 'n' vinegar Disco's and I couldn't wait to get to the bottom where all the salt was lol I would eat about 3 bags a day|`|4VIjILk1aa	Cravings are very common in pregnancy. Even salt! If you are really concerned talk to your doctor about it.
FyDHzellaa	My grandma left me in the kitchen while she went to answer the phone (I was 4), and I saw how the house next door has their fence painted. My fav colour was red (still is), so I grabbed cherry jam and started paining the wooden kitchen window frames with it. When my grandma came back i had one window done and the jam was all over me, windows and half the kitchen.|`|y6YjUWw5aa	Lets see......what did I do when I little? Well, I have this dog. I love him with ALL MY HEART and we've been together since forever. We got him three months after I was born.<3 I have two stories about him (and one other story)!<br>  1. We have these hardwood flooring's in my house (The really fun kind that you can wear socks on and slide across the floor on! :-D!). My dog (whose name is Simon<3 ) LOVES PEOPLE! So, whenever anybody comes to the door, he RACES TOWARDS THEM to greet them! So, there I was at one year old sitting on the floor. Someone comes through the door and Simon rushes to greet them. As he runs passed me, I spin around like a cartoon character (or at least, that's what my dad says!)<br>  2. When I was little, I guess I was kind of curious. So, Simon is sitting there and I'm playing with him and petting him. Then, he yawns. while he's yawning, I put my ENTIRE HEAD in his mouth! All the while, my mother is standing there watching us, petrified. Simon just keeps his mouth open while I inspect it. I finish and crawl away like nothing happened. X-D!<br>  3.It was dinnertime. There I sat in my high chair, tired from a full day of being adorable( :-3 ), staring at my food. My eyes start to close. Soon, I am face-first asleep in my mashed potatoes! What did my family do? They left me to my dreaming! Hahaha!|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Apparently I kept trying to switch out the toilet paper roll connecty - thing with my mom's tampons.<br>  <br>  My mother loveeddddd telling that story.|`|wwPx6Wm6aa	when i was 3yrs old i jumped a 4ft dirt bank on my tricycle and dislocated my elbow and ended up in a cast for 6 weeks. real cute, huh?|`|Dx8eudXfaa	I used to tuck myself into bed when I was sleepy, as young as 3. My parents would find me asleep in my bed, fully clothed, with my shoes next to the bed.|`|OWnSJ9p2aa	i would call animals  weird similar names like i would call coyotes codoytes and penguins penigugus. yeh lol|`|TnusF2KUaa	i called people humans. i would tell my mom "look mom! look at all the cute little humans!"|`|hhWfmFegaa	I would say Hi to everyone in my neighborhood, or anyone who walked by :)|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I took the hammer to our cement steps, my dad didn't think it was so cute.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I used to say hi to everyone, sunbathe nude in front of my house when I was 3.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I would go up to anybody that's basically anything other than white, and I'd try to literally peel the colour off of their skin. I'm not racist at all, I just lived in a neighbourhood that was basically all white, so yeah... But I still think it was cute. Oh, and my twin sister and I would run up to any little kid we saw alone, and give them a hug. ;p<br>  Good luck. x.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Thats really sweet! I gave my teacher a giant hersheys kiss haha.  I dont know if this was cute but I'd always go around asking people for grapes...my mom would get so mad cause it looked like she never fed me or something haha.  I also loved climbing on everything!|`|JFYAPSU7aa	I always pointed at the flash when people took pictures. My family has a million pictures of everybody smiling, then me pointing at the camera. its kinda funny|`|T0pkW783aa	I asked my Dad's friend to marry me.  (I was 3 1/2).
Ka52nbhNaa	When going through fertility treatments (also diagnosed with unexplained infertility, I was 34 and DH was 35), my RE put the success rates at between 15 - 20%.<br>  <br>  A lot of it depends on the number of follicles - medications like femara and clomid tend to cause 1 or 2 follicles to develop putting you at the lower end of the spectrum but if you are injectible fertility meds like Gonal F and produce 4 or more follicles then your chances of success dramatically increase . . . as well as your chance of multiples.  Makes sense . . . the more mature eggs, the more targets for the sperm, the more likely you will become pregnant.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/iui.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/iui.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and loads of baby dust to you!
dDVAUA9saa	Tylenol is safe throughout pregnancy and advil is safe until 28 weeks.  Drink lots of fluids, get lots of sleep.|`|8RfmosODaa	I heard tylenol is safe during pregnancy.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Tylenol cold is best! I found that early it works amazingly well. I KNOW it's fine,it's on a list the dr gave me. He said to just make sure I followed dosing instructions on the bottle,even if it meant taking 3 at once,as long as I didn't exceed the allowed number in a day. The liquid works better for sore throat. I've had no problem with multi symptom stuff,and them saying (the other people) that they know people that miscarried because of this,there's no proof behind that.|`|xue72D76aa	You can take Tylenol for the aching.  You can also suck on Halls or other cough drops to help soothe your throat.  Herbal tea is also good for that, just be sure you are drinking decaffeinated.  Sleep as much as you can and your body should kick whatever virus you picked up.  Good luck!|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	I would just take regular Tynoal and sleep it off :-( it sounds hard but anything multi symptom will harm the baby. I know this because this is how my sister lost her baby... I don't want to scare you but i don't want you to have a similar experience. Ask the dr tomorrow, tonight will be rough but well worth the pain for the health of your child|`|p3d3E75oaa	the best thing to do is take some tylenol and sleep till tomorrow|`|RjdrO7DVaa	you can take one tylenol a day ... that should eleviate the aches ... as for the sore throat, try any hard candy|`|SUT3yL0oaa	I would just take tylenol and drink LOTS of water until I got the chance to talk with the dr tomorrow.|`|3E95vzmeaa	I just went to my doctor on Friday and was told that Tylenol (sp) is fine to take as is over the counter cold medicine! :0) I hope that you feel better soon!
znnEJCZ3aa	People may feel like this is the wrong board, but other than the fact that im craving some carrot cake now, lol, I think iit is PERFECT! Definitely a change from all the "do you think i am pregnant?" posts! <br>  =) Anyway...here's my order! <br>  <br>  3. Coconut Cream : Just because Coconut anything is my favorite scent!!<br>  <br>  5. Pumpkin Pie: Reminds me of the holidays<br>  <br>  8. Carrot Cake: Just because I'm craving it now! lol!<br>  <br>  **********<br>  I'm really confused on the next 5... but I'll try my best...<br>  <br>  1. Vanilla Butter Fudge: I think I would really like it if it wasn't for the fudge part... anything i have ever smelled with chocolate hasn't ever smelled too good to me... I'd stick to just Vanilla Butter<br>  <br>  7. Orange Chiffon Cake: The smell of anything orange just smells clean to me, makes me thing of orange glo furniture polish<br>  <br>  2. Carmel Pecan: I LOVE carmel... but i'm not too much into any sort of nuts... so if it was just Carmel I would probably rate it higher<br>  <br>  4. Fresh Cut Roses: I love flowers and roses but none of the candles ive smelled that are suppose to be the smell of roses, never actually smell like fresh cut roses.<br>  <br>  6. Toasted Marshmellow: For some reason I just think of Jelly Bellies when i hear this and next to buttered popcorn it think it's the worst flavor, so no thank you! <br>  <br>  I love candles though and would love to purchase some when you get started! Good Luck with your business!  And thanks for bringing something NEW to the board! =)|`|BCJRJNfvaa	Wrong section! But I'll still answer it ;)<br>  <br>  1. Pumpkin Pie<br>  2.

This absolutely SHOULD be in the pregnancy section, because who will be the most honest but pregnant women with an overdeveloped sense of smell! LOL! As one of those pregnant women, I'd have to be honest and say they all sound like they'd make me sick except the pumpkin pie and carrot cake!|`|bQk0vpfSaa	umm this shouldnt be in the pregnancy section. you need to switch it to the food topic<br>  !|`|8XjJzj7Naa	1.

I LIKE BANNANA CAKE MORE<br>  <br>  I LIKE PUMPKIN PIE THE BEST, THEN VANILLA BUTTER FUDGE, ROSES, TOASTED MARSHMALLOW, CARMEL PECAN.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I'm not too much for sweet smells unless it's actually food and then I get excited haha!  My favorite smell, like candles and scented oils, is definitely clean linen or cotton. Out of yours, my favorites would be:<br>  Fresh Cut Roses<br>  Orange Chiffon Cake<br>  Carrot Cake<br>  Pumpkin Pie<br>  Coconut Cream<br>  Caramel Pecan<br>  Vanilla Butter Fudge|`|WUt0jsujaa	4, 7, 5, 6, 1, 8, 2, 3|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I really don't care to much for sweets. uh, carrot cake, is the best taste/smell. :)

hwZMijykaa	I feel your frustration! My husband and I have been trying for 2 yrs and still nothing.<br>  <br>  First, your must see an OB/GYN or Infertility Specialist. They'll run a few tests such as a sperm count for your husband ... for you, they'll draw blood, do a PAP, an X-ray of your ovaries, and an HSG (hysterosalpingogram) to make sure your fallopian tubes aren't blocked.<br>  <br>  Once you get the results from that, (if normal) then the Dr. should start you on clomid and progesterone. Most women take about 2+ rounds of clomid before they're preggo. Some may even get lucky at one round. I want kids before I'm 30 also, but my husband and I haven't been so lucky (so far).<br>  <br>  So, I hope this helps and good luck!|`|bWyKAFwuaa	OPK, (ovulation predictor kits) work wonders, and pre-seed (fertility friendly lubricant) and getting a hsg test to see if you have blocked fallopian tubes...and you definetley could qualify|`|kouvKvjSaa	definatly see a doctor and consider fertility pills. it shouldnt take more than a year to get pregnant because that means there are probably problems. you both should get checked and take daily vitamins because vitamins are very important when trying to concieve

6eaWRGaqaa	I went through this phase where I literally thought I was a princess because my nannies used to call me "Daddy's Little Princess" and my parents would spoil me. I marched around wearing this puffy pink costume dress and a silver wand.<br>  <br>  I would go around in my puffy pink dress ordering people around and pretending to speak in French because I thought the only people who spoke French were royalty. When someone would ask me who I was I would say "Une Patronne" because that means "boss" in French.<br>  <br>  One time Mr. Jim, our in-house manager, got the dates confused for when I was supposed to go back to school (I was in pre-k) with the date for when my brother's school started so no one else was at school accept for the secretary. When she asked me where I lived I remember telling her "the palace". When she asked where my house was I said "Your a stranger. I can't speak to strangers!"<br>  <br>  Wow. I was definitely really different when I was younger. Then I went through this really tomboy phase. Haha but now I'm pretty normal (so I think).<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|QdPFouC6aa	i would stand on top of my tree house and start singing disney songs like...under the sea|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I would go up to anybody that's basically anything other than white, and I'd try to literally peel the colour off of their skin.

kfWi9ZkEaa	Dat's to tweet!  It's da wuvvwiest feewing in da worwd.<br>  <br>  You'll know it when it happens. It's like your breakfast turned over.  Just gently, no pain, just wriggled.  It's such a lovely feeling and you notice it sooner with your second baby than your first, where you think you've got wind.  Such a tiny fluttery feeling at first, so sweet.|`|FGjanFY1aa	For me it felt exactly like what it is. The baby kicking. I didn't (& still don't feel the MAJOR hits), but the "fluttering" like exactly like the baby. Never felt bubbles, popcorn, or any of the other feelings.<br>  <br>  I'm now 20wks & still feeling "flutters". Still feel like kicks.<br>  <br>  (Started feeling them the day I hit 16wks).<br>  <br>  EDIT: YES! A previous poster said another common feeling for me - It sometimes feels like muscles twitches, but slower and/or harder.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I tell people it literally felt like I had "butterflies in my tummy." Like tiny wings! Maybe a little like a vibrating cell phone but on the inside of your tummy. Maybe if I ate my cell phone it might feel similar, but I'm not sure what that vibrating would feel like INSIDE my tummy! :D|`|plI0WOrUaa	Its different for everyone i think.

aJLx0nhNaa	Second stage baby formula is a marketing ploy by formula companies to get you to buy from them longer.  I say this as a formula- feeding mom.  Avoid it.  Stage one formula until they are one is all they need.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I asked my doctor about this when my daughter was 6 months.  He said the second stage stuff has more calcium which the baby needs and that I should switch to it.
S4DNQkFraa	First off, Congrats!!<br>  <br>  Answer to your questions:<br>  1.) No, the chemicals are not safe to breathe in during pregnancy and can cause harm.<br>  <br>  2.) Yes, you can have sex. It's perfectly healthy and fine, just don't be too rough as there is more blood flow to the cervix and that can cause some slight spotting and or bleeding. In early pregnancy sex can cause spotting, usually not a cause for alarm, but if this does happen contact your doc and they will give you further instructions. (I say as long as the bleeding doesn't get heavier, you're not having pain and there are no gray clots, you're fine!! :D)<br>  <br>  3.) Eat right, do light exercise, relax and enjoy!! --Veggies and fruits are in order, stay away from fish that can contain high amounts of mercury. Don't use electric blankets and avoid hot tubs. Don't take any meds unless your doc says you can. Drink plenty of water!! Take your prenatal vitamins and do some research. The more you know, the better. <br>  <br>  Just a note, you can also have what's known as "breakthrough bleeding" This can occur around the time your period would be due, not all woman get it because each woman is different, even pregnancy to pregnancy. <br>  Any new changes or anything you're worried about, don't hesitate to call your doc. Have a safe and healthy pregnancy!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|AA11724307	First off, CONGRATS!<br>  <br>  I would check the hair thing with your doctor as some chemicals get absorbed into the skin and can be passed to the baby<br>  <br>  Sex is fine unless you start to bleed...then you need to lay off the sex for a few weeks (or so my doctor told me)<br>  <br>  Take your prenatal vitamins and eat lots of fruits and veggies.  Make sure you have a good breakfast to start your day and lots of milk or daily products.  When you get hungry...and you will alot try and eat something healthy.  When I get hunger pains I try and grab some fruit or if I'm home I cook up some veggies or have a salad.  Eating healthy is sooo much easier when you know your doing it for the good of your baby.  good luck and have a happy and healthy nine months.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	1. my baby's aunt is African American and she waited until after the 1rst trimester to relax her hair. (similar to dye or perm)<br>  <br>  2. Yes, your doctor will tell you if he wants a professional opinion! lol<br>  <br>  3. Eat only 300 calories extra a day, and do pregnancy yoga, light exersise. Eat healthy! =D<br>  <br>  Happy pregnancy!|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	1. Yes. <br>  2. Of course. Why not? It doesn't affect baby in any way.<br>  3. If you exercise now you can continue but when you get farther along, no jogging or exercises in which you are bouncing! Eat healthy snacks (apples, oranges, etc.) instead of junk food and you will be fine. I thought I was over weight before pregnancy, but I would go back to that weight in a heartbeat now. :-)<br>  <br>  Congrats on the wonderful news! Go to Dollar Tree 4 ur at home pregnancy test. And they do work. Trust me! :-)|`|3E95vzmeaa	The best suggestion is to talk to your doctor to answer all of your questions fully.  However, I get my hair done (dyed) every 8 weeks or so, and I am on my 4th and my doctor told me it was fine! :0) <br>  <br>  Yes, you can still have sex, unless your doctor says not too due to some kind of complications and aprox 20-25 lbs is a healthy weight to gain if you are a bit overweight...Again, the best thing you could do, is go and see your doctor!|`|VNgBIVk5aa	1. I'm pretty sure they suggest that you wait until after the first trimester to use chemicals on your hair. So if you can wait until after you're 14 weeks, you should be okay.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, you can still definitely have sex. If you experience bleeding afterward, you might want to discuss it with your doctor.<br>  <br>  3. Don't eat fast food, no matter how delicious it sounds. French fries, milkshakes, etc. aren't good for you or the baby. Instead, drink low-fat milk or smoothies with yogurt, whole wheat bread, brown rice, etc. I know it doesn't sound great, but you'll feel a lot better and you won't gain too much weight in the end.|`|gWwFzwOiaa	sweetie..you are pregnant.  There is no such thing as a false positive b/c in order to get a positive there has to be HCG in your body and thats only produced when you are pregnant.  You can have a false negative though.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor about all those questions.  A lot of women are still able to have sex..it's actually healthy lol and I was told if you have sex then you could have an easier birth. :)  You just wont be able to do any certain positions and really hard.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	1. Until the second trimester I would suggest changing it up to braids or something else you like that is easy to manage, trust me you get so dang sleepy that doing your hair is about the last thing on your mind anyways.<br>  <br>  2. Yes you can. Unless you are bleeding or having any other complications.<br>  <br>  3. Stay away from things like deep fried foods and fatty foods. Ensure you get enough of the foods you need like veggies dairy and grain. And do not up your food intake to too much more. typically around 2300 calories I believe.|`|plI0WOrUaa	First of all CONGRATS!!<br>  <br>  I think you'll have to ask your doc about the relaxer.  I'm not sure if that is safe or not.  You can absolutely have sex.  The only time sex is off limits is if you have a problem with your pregnancy and your doctor limits sex or penetration.  No harm to the baby.  It has no idea what is going on.  to have a healthy pregnancy, take your prenatal vitamins. If you haven't started, start now.  They prevent birth defects and make sure you and your baby are getting everything you need.  Don't smoke, drink, get too stressed out.  Eat healthy.  I only gained 3 pounds my 1st 4 months.  I exercise too.  At 5 months, i really started putting on the weight.  It is important not to load up on sweets and carbs.  Eat lots of vegetables, fruit, whole grains and protein.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!  :)|`|pOXShnL2aa	1) yes you can. since it's only every two months, it should be fine.<br>  <br>  2) again, yes you can. girls have sex while being pregnant all the time. just don't put too much trauma on your stomach.<br>  <br>  3) diet and exercise. :) both are very important, pregnant or not. dieting and exercise can keep you from gaining TOO much weight, plus you'd more than likely have a healthy child!|`|oQ5oKILHaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!! <br>  Sex is ok in almost every situation unless Doc says no-no.<br>  Eat healthy take pre-natals!<br>  I'm pretty sure you can still do your hair. Most people say not to but its all up to your Doc.|`|uxFk2dOaaa	I don't know any of your questions, but usually when it says your positive then you are indeed positive|`|7EDmejGvaa	Congrats I would say you are pregnant, you very rarely get a false positive. <br>  1. Yes you can still get your hair relaxed<br>  2. Yes you can have as much sex as you want it will not harm the baby. I had sex just about everyday in every way until I gave birth.<br>  3. A healthy amount of weight gain is apx. 20-30 lbs. I gained less when I started at a heavier weight, so eat healthy stay active and enjoy the ride ;)|`|LJkPRqN0aa	first to clear it up pink lines means you ARE, not maybe...and i agree to not 100% trust home preg tests, the only way you will know 100% is to get a blood test. <br>  <br>  1. i would lay off of any chemicals just to make sure that you are not harming the baby<br>  <br>  2. yes unless your doctor says anything otherwise (this is something to ask your dr)<br>  <br>  3. vitamins, folic acid, fruits, veggies, ect all of that stuff. <br>  <br>  dont worry you will be fine :)|`|S4pNsW3Taa	If it has two lines you ARE pregnant.<br>  <br>  1.NO<br>  2.Yes<br>  3. Eat potein veggies fruit milk etc. You only need 300 extra calories a day now that your pregnant
955YoHvVaa	I did the hip hop abs workouts after I had my baby and it shrunk back up and is flat again..It's not a basic boring exercise video its actually fun..maybe try that? Worked for me.|`|D1qUehcFaa	I'm struggling with this right now too- I just had a baby boy a month ago=] <br>  <br>  <br>  With my twins-who are 4 yrs old, I had virtually no trouble get back to my pre babies weight and size. I've been a competitive runner since I was 11, and I just added a few more sit ups to my daily routine.  <br>  <br>  That being said- I have a friend who took a belly dancing class after her son was born and it worked wonders for her. Not saying this in a bad way, but she looks better now than she ever has!|`|OEv8gjPxaa	oh im the same my son is 11 months and ive just got that flabby tummy, the other day this lady came up to me and asked how many months pregnant i was i got so embarrased.

I dont know how people do it|`|chiFCUC5aa	i am back to my pre pregnancy weight but my stomach is not as tight as it was before. i think my 10 month old son prefers the pillowy feel as opposed to rock hard abs anyways!!! i think its all genetics.....i go to the gym regularly and eat healthy and i feel great and i think thats the important thing....i dont even mind having to wear a one piece i feel like it elongates my body and i feel more mature and starlet lke in a one piece. (victoria secret makes some great one pieces with cut outs in the right places for moms!!) and hey i still have great legs!!!! embrace the good things....your great toned arms from doing baby curls!! the way your baby snuggles you. My husband still thinks im sexy and im sure yours feels the same way about you!!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I'm still working on mine to. Have you heard of the Bender Method of Core Training? Basically you just need a small ball to do crunches on. You can really feel it working from the inside tightening your muscles. It's a good work out and it makes me feel better after doing it.|`|deIzFnV8aa	I have heard that doing front planks really helps - prop yourself on your elbows and toes andd let your tummy keep you up.  Start with just a few seconds and increase up to a minute.  I think  a lot of pilates moves are great for toning the tummy, too.  Maybe see if your library has any workout DVDs that focus on pilates abs.
FEg0PDdnaa	For most people a home pregnancy test will not be accurate until the day you miss your period and sometimes not until a few days later. Some tests may be able to show positive if you are pregnant up to five days before your next expected period so count backward from your next expected period and decide if you want to test early, if not wait until the day you expect it.|`|8RfmosODaa	As soon as your first day of a missed period|`|U12kQCD4aa	You could try after a week and it'd be semi accurate but generally about 3weeks moving towards the forth week to take into account any changes in your menstrual cycle brought on by stress,etc..<br>  Hope this helps<br>  x|`|8XjJzj7Naa	Normally two weeks after you ovulate and have sex you will see a positive pregnancy test. I am not sure when you might have conceived so I cannot tell you exactly when you would get a positive.|`|plI0WOrUaa	the earliest is 5 days before your period.  You have to buy the right test for this and use first urine of the day.  Its not 100%, but you could try.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	2 weeks at the earliest you can start testing but you may still get a false negative.  If you do get a negative wait a week and test again.|`|p3d3E75oaa	wait till you have a missed period but like 3-4 weeks|`|uxFk2dOaaa	If you got a good one then it will tell you fourteen days after you had had sex and if you get a normal one then it will be best to take the day of your missed period|`|4VIjILk1aa	wait 2 weeks to take a test
MHOxPs8Oaa	Talk to your mom, talk to anybody you can, don't try doing this on your own, you really need to talk to somebody soon, so you can figure out a lot about what you need to do.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Well, you have three choices.<br>  <br>  1: Keep it.<br>  2: Abort it.<br>  3: Adopt it out.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you decide to do either 1 or 3, tell your parents as soon as you can so you can get checked out by the doctors and get yourself going on eating healthy and taking vitamins.Right now is a crucial point for development.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Your life has already changed, no matter what you decide.  But you can handle it if you get enough support, and you may even turn it into a positive thing.  It's good that your boyfriend is there for you, but you also need people who will love and support you forever, no matter what.  That would probably be your parents.  Tell them. They're going to find out anyway. Ask for their help.  They may be upset for a while, but they will help you through this. You are their daughter; they will want to take care of you.|`|OBPL49vWaa	this happened to my mother in law, she had sex one time when she was 14 years old, and delivered when she was 15. She kept her baby and raised it with out the father. Her mother friends and family were all very supportive of her.  Things do happen. You wont lose your friends, and if you do then there not your real friends anyways, and you will make some new ones who will support your decision.  A lot of my friends and family are young mothers and they still get to have there life and go to school and work.|`|MfCkiJCVaa	You're young yet hunny, and it changes your life in more ways than you would EVER think.

Then call the doc and make an appt.  Good luck....wish I could be more help!|`|1jcBMzVwaa	The best advice I have heard so far is, talk to your parents, because honestly that's the starting point. You are too young to be considering any of these choices alone. Everyone is different and what may be right for one person, may not be right for you. You have to make the choice that you believe you will be best able to live with.<br>  If you are uncomfortable speaking with your parents alone, you could speak to your school guidance counsellor first, or a trusted adult, and they could be with you when you tell your parents.<br>  Whatever you decide, I wish you all the best.|`|rHDWxzDraa	hi im so sorry for your dilemma:( i fell pregnant at that age also so i know exactly how you feel. you have to tell your parents sweety, and i know thats probably going to be extremely hard but you really need to. they are going to be the biggest support through everything. you have so many options too so make sure you really have a good think about everything. having a child so young can affect you in ways you may not even think of. i didnt keep my baby and dont have any regrets about my decision because i feel it was a well imformed one. good luck with everything:)|`|15423591314a80b690eb6deb8aaebcb4aa	Talk to your parents,  talk with your boyfriends parents.   Your best bet is adoption.  If you are lucky your parents or his parents will adopt the baby and you can still see him/her.  I would say, keep the pregnacy between you and your parents (and perhaps his) and go away for the summer.  When you and your parents come back in fall, they have adopted a new little sibling for you.  <br>  <br>  Try to keep your legs closed in the future.|`|tKr7sXEJaa	find someone you can trust<br>  email me at julianna1633@comcast.net if you would ever like to talk<br>  i am 16 but i will be here for oyu<br>  and mayve tell your parents and see a doctor<br>  the sonner you tell them the better|`|K8PjbPOHaa	tell ur parents immediately i know it will be hard but u have got to tell them<br>  whatever u do, do not overreact and get an abortion cuz u will be very sorry and upset

Same re your back.  <br>  <br>  Tired due to emotional exhaustion.  No missed period yet: your things to worry about are<br>  <br>  1. pregnancy<br>  2. std.  <br>  <br>  If your pelvis keeps being sore, think about no. 2.  as to pregnancy; the first thing you'll notice will be stretched breasts, which are sore and tender.  They may happen before any missed period; or you may be late and it not come.  <br>  <br>  How far between periods did you have intercourse?  If you were within 1 week of your period either way you could be okay (not guaranteed but certainly better.)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4VIjILk1aa	Anytime you have unprotected sex you have a great chance on being pregnant. From what you are saying it sounds like you could be pregnant. Go to your nearest planned parent hood. You can go with a friend, you won't need your parents and see if you are pregnant. Tests aren't always right.

EmYNUZcXaa	every woman is different. did you give birth naturally or did you have a csection? that plays a huge factor in what your body is capable of. do you work out at all? are you doing any toning exercises? eating healthy and having portion control? start eating healthy, getting cardio into your weekly exercising plan and start working out to tone your body and focus in on your abs. i was 125 prebaby and 176 delivery day and now i'm at 152 10 weeks postpartum and i have been working out over a week and have already seen a bit of a difference. good luck to you. anything is possible.|`|no9N3zjMaa	Do ab work outs and that will help|`|CaoVS1cdaa	Yeah it takes some time to go away.... I had a baby like 6 months ago and I would say not til she was about 4 or 5 months did I begin to feel normal again. As far as your weight you have to take care of yourself because after my baby I completely lost the 35 and some pounds I gained.  I havent really been taking care of myself so I have gained like 13 pounds back so it just really depends on your eating habbits.|`|TfzXJcvuaa	hate to say it but it doesn't go away. I weighed 134 before pregnancy with my first and 163 at delivery. Although I lost down to 128 my belly never returned to firm. That was five years ago.

EmYNUZcXaa	could just be him exploring his hands and fingers. my daughters doctor told me it was fine for her to do it. he said that its nothing to really worry about. she does it after she's done feeding too and when i offer her more of her bottle she refuses and i'll give her her binkie and she'll spit it out. :) its most likely not teething and just simple curiosity :)|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It's kind of like a soother for him. My son did that but he mostly uses his thumb now. He won't take a pacifier anymore unless it's right after a bottle. It's normal and it is ok. Like someone else said soon it will be anything and everything go in his mouth so relax while you can! :)|`|AA10766729	It's pretty normal.

5ZwIASCgaa	Buy flash cards!!! I seen the advertisements on tv and i couldnt believe it i went right online and went to order it and then i seen how much it was and was like nooo way...so instead i bought flash cards and it works just as well my son is 11 months old and know kittie, spongebob,juice belly button, dada, mama,toys even more and he has been pointing at things since he was 6 and 1/2 months old when i ask him where is... its all up to the parent work with ur child and they will learn u dont need to use that kind of money...u can get them something else and something better..|`|Yf8Br9APaa	There are a lot of things lke this out there that claim to have a system for creating instant knowledge. its good to enrich your child but you can do that with other things. get small childrens books and read with them at night, that works well. <br>  This system is really not worth your extra dollar, just invest in spending time with your child, reading to them. They'll love it, and so will you. It has been done this wa for years and is one of the best methods for teaching a child to read.<br>  Even is they don't catch on right away, be patient!|`|mTQutqyAaa	my friend got those and i told her she was crazy. she thought her 1 year old would b able to read in a few months. she does it with him daily and he can only say dada after doing them for about 4 months. i agree with the other people. flashcards are great. or u can talk to ur doc a bout a speech therapist my daughter started when she was 1 and a half. she was behind on how much she can say and now she is 2 and a half and is at the level of a 3 year old. she can't read but why put so much pressure on a child that young. just read to them and do the flashcards and ur child should develop normally.|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I was watching the infomercial the other night when I was up breastfeeding my 17-m-o daughter. The commercial shows what they do to try and get the baby to read. They show the flash card, then the action, then the two together. Huh. I can make or buy cheap flashcards and do that with my daughter. All for under $10.<br>  <br>  When she eats, my daughter likes to look at books and my old parenting magazines. (She likes the pictures and if they get too beat up, they go to the recycle bag.) In one was an advertisement for professional photos. In the ad, one of those annoying cards in magazines, eventually, with my husband showing her the word and saying it, she learned to recognize "FREE". However, she's not quite transferred it to other "frees" on other things. She has transferred "R" and "E". Also, she has a sleeper with "Love Me" on it. (I don't like that it has a heart in lieu of the "o".) One day she was sitting in my lap pointing to the letters and I said "e" for the e in "Love". She repeteated it (she had been saying "e" for awhile). For awhile, she would only recognize that "e". Eventually, I got her to recognize the other "e" and she's transferring it more, in her alphabet books (which we read several times daily) and in other things. <br>  <br>  I learned to read when I was four, as I sat with my older sister who read out loud to our mother and they pointed to the words. I eventually began to recognize them as well, ticking off my sister if I knew a word and she didn't. I think I even knew some basic math when I started kindergarten or first grade. Yet, I still wasn't a scholar. <br>  <br>  I think they are a great gimmick, just like most of the other late night infomercials. (They are funny, though.)|`|pPlVUIA8aa	Scam.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do at this age is to read to your kid each night to get them interested.
AA10912643	what is "for my own good"? you make it sound as though YOU would be better off if the kid didn't have a dad. seeing as you are from michigan, one of the hardest hit states by this recession, dad must be moving to a new place to find work. you on the other hand must be staying with the reason you guys split up. if i come of as bitter i offer no apologies. my first two baby mommas couldn't keep their pants on around town and i wonder if my 9 year old daughter is even mine. i have always paid child support for the two that don't live with me and custody has no bearing on support. you will most likely be on state assistance so they will help you squeeze him for every penny.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	What is in the best interest of the child?<br>  <br>  I find it sad that the father does not want to be with the son.<br>  <br>  The child deserves to know his father and paternal family.Too bad he doesn't feel the same.<br>  <br>  Does the father want to see the child at all or at least have visitation rights?<br>  <br>  <br>  If the father has no court ordered custody or child's support, you technically have full custody already.Since you want it in writing, go to court and file for custody of him.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that since he is the father, he can change his mind at any point and time and can come back and file for visitation rights/joint custody if he pleases.Full custody doesn't mean he is signing his rights away.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I would do it just to be safe because it would be in paper.  That way, he can't just "forget to pay child support" and he also couldn't just waltz in and take your son whenever he wanted to and not show up for a while.  Trust me, that happened when I was a kid.  My mom just took me and moved 900 miles away and my dad couldn't do anything for a while because nothing was in paper.  So definitely file.  It's the smart thing to do!
2tVQm7Llaa	Give Mom some numbers for therapy, family counseling, etc. to help her deal with all of this. You could also help the mother track down her daughter. If she has her social security number, she should be able to hire someone to do it. If the daughter doesn't want to get in contact, however... Really, that's her choice and there's nothing you can do.
RyYWzEZcaa	I have a 22 month old, so I might be of some help.  Does the boy use a toddler bed alreayd?  My son is still in a crib, although I am thinking of switching him to a toddler bed when he turns two.  Highchair probably isn't necessary, but maybe a booster seat for the table.  How about outlet plugs?  There is something about those littles holes that make kids want to try to electricute themselves.  Small fork and spoon and maybe plastic plate and sippy cup.  My son likes to color, but needs very close supervision....he eats markers so I only do crayons.  Blocks, simple puzzles, any kind of truck or cars, books.  Make sure cabinets with chemicals are locked and knives, medicines and breakables are also out of reach.  My son alreaydy knows how to push a chair over to a counter to reach things, so keep that in mind.  Hope this was helpful, good luck!|`|75TRCPx0aa	no he don't need a high chair get him a chair and table  @walmart they bout $20|`|ENANtueuaa	She wont be bringing anything with her for her son? By a toddler seat, i hope you mean a car seat and not a booster seat. A 2 year old needs to be in a 5 point harness still, or a car seat with an overhead shield, although they are not as safe. You'll need outlet covers. A highchair is not necessary, but he'll need a booster. If she not bringing sippy cups, he'll need some of those, and also some toddler silverware. As for toys, you can never go wrong with the basics...large blocks, large cars and trucks, board books, and even a few coloring books and some crayons. They have all kinds of great toys, and the ages are stated right on the box, just buy age appropriate and you'll be fine. Hope this helps!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well you need a booster seat that can be attached to any chair...if the child will turn 2 there... then you can get him this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5192166" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  it's a booster seat chair with a tray so the baby can make a mess in his tray ;) it's great, because you can fold it up flat to take out to dinner or somewhere else.<br>  <br>  Outlet covers, and medicine cabinet locks,make sure nothing small i.e: coins, candy, small toys...  are put up in a high place where the child cannot reach. <br>  <br>  have a look at this<br>   <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10264173&findingMethod=rr" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  As far as toys.. well a couple of stuffed animals would be good, some toy cars, some big blocks--my daughter just turned 2 and loves these!<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10629518" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>   <br>  Hmm I dont know what else... maybe some Dora and Diego figurines...<br>  <br>  But isnt his mom going to bring any toys?

hwZMijykaa	Yes, it can. While it would be unusual – it is possible.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy occurs at the time of ovulation or within about 48 hours of the egg being released form the woman's ovary. Obviously it is necessary for the egg to be fertilised by the man's sperm during the time it takes from being released to reaching the womb. <br>  <br>  Generally, ovulation takes place about the middle of a woman's cycle, that is about day 14. But ovulation can occur sometimes very early or very late in the cycle. <br>  <br>  Say you have a 28-day cycle counting from the first day of your period. You could have ovulated on day 24 - not that unusual – and the egg could have been still capable of fertilization and implantation by day 26 – two days before your next period was due to start.|`|mTQutqyAaa	i think so. ur most fertile time is i think a week or 2 before ur period but i think u can still get pregnant right b4. and yes u can still have the period. after the fertilized egg attaches to the uterus there is usually light bleeding called implantation bleeding.|`|7PS3fSSPaa	preganancy to my knowledge only occurs after the period usually anywhere from 3- 5 days after. there is a small window for a female to get pregnant.|`|7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	Medically, logically and biologically its not possible.

ENANtueuaa	Ok...what? I think you're just as crazy as she is lol<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm not being mean...but i can't possibly take this question seriously, who would actually do this to their 16 year old, and waht 16 year old likes to wear diapers...it sounds made up!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Look dont even bother pretending it's real it's even more annoying... if it's try she was abused sexually and mentally till age 4 and you got her when she was 5... no doctor, treatment and therapy got her to improve?? and if she has a problem with going to the bathroom then she's disabled and should be treated accordingly not asking her to throw her baby stuff away...<br>  But anyhow... trolll|`|AA11193773	I read your profile and this sounds like the real deal. Listen, what you do is just stop buying her diapers and crap, don't give her tv, don't give her shopping, just ground her with no diapers and baby stuff.. If she poops in her pants don't clean it up. eventually she'll get sick of it. By letting her have diapers you give in. show her who's boss. give her her meals in her room and give her occasional bathroom breaks. You can give her a few books to read and that's it. Just her room and school. She might beg, don't give in. If she hits you, hit her back. Until she calms down you can talk about how your doing this for her own good. If she refuses  to wear underpants shove her in them. trash all the baby stuff or donate them. in the mean time get hold of a therapist.|`|79kPBWMnaa	OMG for one there is nothing wrong with her collecting whatever she wants even if it is baby, anyway you are a TROLL and really need help yourself for coming up with something so fake.

It is a GOOD thing you are not pregnant, so everything is right.<br>  <br>  Even for adults with stable hormones and cycles, getting pregnant is not always easy.  Some people "luck out" and it happens easily, but getting pregnant is actually a pretty miraculous thing because a lot of things have to be perfect for it to occur.  <br>  <br>  Most doctors will not lok further into fertility issues until a grown woman has been unable to conceive for atleast a year.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	You have a disease on the brain.<br>  <br>  Why are you trying to get pregnant at 15?<br>  <br>  consider yourself lucky take the hint.|`|YeMI2xwiaa	Why are you trying to get pregnant?<br>  <br>  No there is nothing wrong.

You should be thankful you haven't gotten pregnant, whether or not you think you want a baby. A baby is a huge responsibility and they are very expensive.

Even though it says a normal fertile woman can take upto a year to get pregnant. But lets face it, your 15.. You're very fertile!

Cx5Zo7IIaa	They tell you eight weeks but the Planned Parenthood in Texas will give it to you up to 11 weeks. The first pill stops progesterone production in your body you will take that pill at the clinic when you get your ultrasound to confirm how pregnant you are. They give you the second pill to take the next day at home or your place of choice. My cramping (it was very intense) lasted 4 hours, they will give you a prescription for codeine 3 which is Tylenol and small dose of codeine. If you can't handle pain take it before hand. I did mine without any pain medication because I wanted to feel everything that was happening. But basically it feels like a miscarriage. you will be required to go back in two weeks for a sonogram to make sure you passed it all. You absolutely must go back fro the follow up appt. A girl died in Cali because she didn't and she still had tissue in her that was necrotic which gave her a deadly infection. She was stupid and the pill got a bum wrap for a while because of it. <br>  If you need any other answers feel free to email me. <br>  Oh and ignore all the sanctimoniousus *itches on here who will call you names and tell you to carry to term then put it up for adoption. When they have made the choice between adoption and abortion and given their child up for adoption then they can give you their opinion but I don't think any of them have ever been in that situation. This is your choice and yours alone.|`|elLDrkNiaa	i think it is funny your so concerned about cramps and bleeding and not even a concern about the future person of importance inside of you right now?  It wasn't his/her fault you did the deed and got yourself pregnant only to waste such a young life and nip it in the bud so to speak.  I'm with the others in saying you should consider adoption. You won't go through much more pain and suffering during pregnancy, it will be a little longer though but worth it once you see that healthy baby kicking and screaming and the most precious event ever.  i agree with the other answerer that pro-life people also include atheists and non religious folk.|`|ZbzpF4jAaa	Why not consider Adoption as an option?  Lots of parents are sterile trying to have kids and you could really help them out.  That way you wouldn't lose the baby.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I understand what you're saying about people ranting. I am pro choice,although I will say it's not somethig I'd choose to do. Anyways,from what I've read,up to 8 weeks is the longest you can take the pills. (the abortion pill) I'm not sure about pain and cramping,that's something to ask about when you go to get it,they may be able to tell you more,I imagine it's different for everyone. Good luck with everything.

Good luck and have fun.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	google summer camps in illinois.<br>  find a camp you like.<br>  call them and ask to apply.<br>  good luck :)|`|NMjM2X4taa	Camp jobs are fun but be prepared for very little sleep. I worked at a camp in WI last summer and I am going to be working there again this summer. the type of job you can get in a camp depends on many factors. do you want to work in a day or overnight camp? christian/church camp or some other kind of camp? your age also plays a big role. <br>  overnight camps generally don't hire counselors under 18, but may of may not hire Operations staff under 18 (OP staff). most christian/church camps will not hire anyone under 18 without some family connection to the camp. <br>  <br>  some day camps will hire 15+ year olds to be the counselors but these camps are few. <br>  <br>  do you know what kind of camp you want to work in? <br>  <br>  you can google the kind of camp you want to work in and apply at the camps you think you might like. but you need to hurry. camp jobs fill quickly.

chiFCUC5aa	the baby will be fine as long as they are bundled....the front body carrier was great for me in the cold weather but a stroller with the carrier attached is great too because your not pushing them into the wind.....my son was born last february and we went for a walk every day ( we have a dog) the fresh air is great for them....and the sun is good for newborns too not direct exposure of course i remember all the nurses my doctor and the pediatrician saying that fresh air was the best thing for babies and the sun actually made his jaundice go away so much faster!!<br>  <br>  have fun on your outing!!|`|KICQQxLxaa	That is fine, but I would put baby in a baby carrier so you can "wear" him/her.  That way your body heat is helping keep them warm.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the hat...have fun : )|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Properly bundled I would say yes. I am assuming by short walk you mean a few blocks or less.<br>  <br>  If you have a front pack that you can place your baby in inside of your coat that would likely be best. Obviously you want to make sure your baby can breath properly and put a hat on him/her. Your body heat will help the baby maintain his/her temperature best.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	you should not take the baby out if it's below 50 degrees.. the baby is tiny and can easily be "chilled though".. if there's a real emergency and you have to head out when it's cold, make sure that all extermities are covered and baby's head is well-insulated.. another important point - take a scarf and cover your baby's face.. the cold air will reach baby's lungs faster than it reaches yours and if the face is not covered, the side effect is a lung infection..|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	put a hat on his head that will cover the sun and make sure he doesn't have to many layers on but also that his skin is not exposed to the sun|`|bd035cd5fbed641889c4230d224d60d3aa	Sure, just bundle him for the weather!
NCa8bOjSaa	It hasn't happened to me, but i have a feeling that if I had become pregnant at 16, my parents would have obviously been disappointed, but they'd have no right to judge.  My mum was 16 when she got pregnant, and my dad was 20 at the time.  Their parents both had them at early ages too...either 16 or 17.  So if they had been angry with me for having a child at a young age, they'd know they were being hypocritical.<br>  <br>  I know this isn't much help, but just think of it like this...teenagers have been becoming parents since the dawn of time.  If your own parents get upset, it's just because they likely had hoped for a different path for you.  But you choose your own way.  and they'll understand that, even if it isn't right away.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|8aTrJ5yVaa	my friend got pregnant at this age and her parents were not one bit impressed... its a big shock for any parent i guess. bottom line here is things really do always work out ok no matter how bad they seem at the time... best of luck with everything.. x|`|afAbSq5gaa	Im 19 and may be pregnant ( not confirmed yet) and my parents took it just fine, It was a shock at first but your parents are going to love u no matter what, it might just take some time for it to sink in and for them to get over it. If your going to keep the baby your going to need their help. Good Luck !|`|0xOXVTyRaa	My mum was embarrassed at first, she was not happy at all and told me i was stupid but she would support whichever decision i made... but she was there when my daughter was born, which was not an easy birth..and has completely changed her views ever since.<br>  <br>  My daughter is now 13 and because i was young when i had her....17, we get on really well...i find it easy to relate to her.<br>  Each parent is different. some might want to be supportive and help, others might be angry and throw around the blame.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, hope everything goes ok or you.|`|PGiOSIBkaa	My friend was 14 when she got pregnant.  You know, the dad being 23 and her dad's best friend, they were shocked.  But they were there for her and helped her out so much.  Parents will love you no matter what!|`|T9fuWReRaa	Just get an abortion. It would be really difficult to raise this baby on your own. Adoption is great if you're up for it, but that would be very hard.|`|398765835eece848c6743a2e3f098e02aa	i got pregnant when i was 17..i have very strict parents.<br>  when i told them they were disappointed,but gave me lots of advice and told me its not about me anymore its about the baby..<br>  now they cundt b happier with their granddaughter..they help me out alot but im still responsible for her..shes mine not theirs...
rFRo6DGTaa	No, it sounds like you have sciatic , I had it also around that time in the pregnancy, if you haven't dropped yet, when you do the pressure from your baby will relieve that pain, or you maybe just dropped a little and it is putting pressure of your back.  sciatic is when you have a pinched nerve in your back that causes back pain as well as leg numbness, there was also times where it was really hard to walk, my doctor took me off work early because of it.  I use to take a tylenol or two to relieve the pain, I was also given a list of stretches to do, and was told to do hot and cold compressions on my lower back to relieve some pressure.  Hang in there I know it's not the funnest thing to go through, but it should go ways soon enough, I had it for a couple weeks then she finally moved down and let off some of that pressure on the nerve. good luck!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Your doctor will only induce if the baby is healthy enough and only if he thinks it is absolutely necessary.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	He may. You'll have to ask and see what he says. Every doctor is different. =D|`|AA12395149	Depends on your doctor.  Some will induce for such reasons, but they will usually wait until at least 38 weeks.  Through 37 weeks is considered term, there is a difference between going into labor naturally and being induced.  At 37 weeks, there is still a slight chance that the baby's lungs are fully ready for the outside world just yet.  Some doctors won't induce unless there is a medical reason like gestational diabetes or pregnancy induced hypertension before 39 weeks.  It all comes down to how your doctor feels about induction and how closely he follows ACOG guidelines (which say women shouldn't be induced until 39 weeks of pregnancy).<br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|BCJRJNfvaa	I'm 37 weeks, and I'm actually going to be induced tomorrow. However, I'm having twins and it could be dangerous to all of our health to keep them in longer. Talk to your doctor. He may, it really depends though. Good luck!|`|SUT3yL0oaa	Very doubtful. Unless the baby is in distress they usually won't induce because your in pain.

I've loved Finn ever since I read The Notebook. I'm not sure if any of those names flow with your other three, but out of them, I'd probably pick Matilda Rose. Since this is your last, and it's a girl, maybe you could try something like Lily or Charlotte to kind of tie in with Violet. Lily & Violet are both flowers, and Charlotte and Violet just sound really nice together. Good luck!|`|YVmM9Fanaa	Matilda Rose:<br>  Ehhh it's ok but I don't think it would fit in to well with your other childrens unique names<br>  Ellery Jane:<br>  I love this name!!!

xoM9a7Uyaa	Your vitamins aren't going to have anything to do with your weight. If anything, by taking your vitamins, you'll be healthier with a better balance of nutrients in your body, and you should lose weight better.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's not the vitamins. For most of us the weight doesn't just melt off the way you hear, I even breastfeed and it didn't happen that way for me. I only retained 20lbs after my son was born and it took me until he was 9 months old to lose it all. It just takes time. Weight loss should be a slow process, if it's not it's more likely to come back. 1-2lbs a week is healthy.
xue72D76aa	I can think of a few things.<br>  <br>  A) Who is going to take care of the baby after he/she is born? <br>  B) Are we emotionally ready to take on a child?

We'll also possibly need formula if breastfeeding doesn't go well.  All of these things can be very expensive!<br>  D) Can we afford to have a child as far as the medical costs go?

The first question that two people - despite their age - need to consider before they have a baby is whether they are ready to spend the rest of their lives taking care of another person.  Both partners need to realize that bringing a baby means 24/7 and it doesn't stop when that adorable baby is an older child (especially if the child should happen to be born with or later develop any special needs).  While  having a child is a blessing, it should also be the most incredibly selfless thing that 2 people can do and that means constantly thinking about everything in terms of how decisions will affect the child as well as the parent making the decision.   <br>  Good luck with your project!!!|`|SRyQmowFaa	Are either or u working, is there income earned between the two of yall?

qZ0aMR1faa	I got cancer. It sucked. But I was optimistic about everything and hopeful and I am in perfect health now! Plus, I always had friends around.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	Well I don't know if this exactly counts because when it happened it felt like the worst thing in the world (and it still feels pretty bad right now) but later on in life I think I am going to be thankful for this opportunity. My parents are international teachers and when I was young we moved around quite often but when I was in 7th grade I thought we had finally settled down (we had been in the states for 4 years) and I was really happy with my school, friends, dance team and life in general. When my parents told me we were moving to India I was absolutely devastated. I fought with them for days, refused to eat and locked myself in my room because I thought my life was perfect and that India would be horrible. Eventually though I obviously lost the fight and we moved to Chennai. At first I was right, I was completely miserable in India and I missed my old life but after a long time I slowly got used to it. I have been here for almost two years and although I have made friends (I go to an American International school) and gotten used to it, some days are still really hard and I miss all of my old friends. Very soon I will be moving again and now I am starting to realize what an experience this has been, it has completely changed me socially, religiously, culturally and in ways I can't even explain. I have lost a lot of friends, been depressed and had to completely readjust because things are so different here however through these struggles I have learned a lot more about myself and I feel more worldly. I feel like if I had stayed in the US I would have missed out on so much and eventually turned in to one of those snotty, dumb, typical popular american teenagers (not to stereotype. Even though now I'm a little weird and unstable, I love who I am and wouldn't give up this experience because it has made me who I am today.|`|AA10556677	Compared to rape, this is pretty light stuff...<br>  <br>  <br>  A close friend and I fell in love (cheesy, but that's the only way to put it) after we went to Senior Homecoming together. Long story made short,  I didn't get around to asking her out until about three months after we first kissed and by that point, things had...changed. Not in a good way. So my worst moment ever is probably getting the "friends" talk two days after Christmas via instant message because she was too embarrassed and terrible to tell me in person (like I said, we were close friends before all this). We haven't talked much since. <br>  <br>  It's a little hard to tell how this has "changed" me since it's fairly recent. Life lesson, though: no matter how long you've been friends with someone, you can still lose everything in what feels like moments. Don't take people for granted, especially friends.|`|U3TcMDkuaa	my mom is a drug addicit and swore on my life she wasnt gonna leave again and she left that nite.. umm it made me not trust anybody<br>  <br>  my mom, dad, stepdad, have left and my grandparents always say stuff like "oh im SO glad i came home"(sarcastically).. hmm that is making me try my hardest to grad. early adn get me and my brothers out of this house.<br>  <br>  i have raised my two younger brothers.. its taught me how to me a mom<br>  <br>  4 days after my 15th birthday i was raped by my "bestfriend".. now i cry everytime me and my boyfriend try to do it in the dark cuz all i see is his face and i am VERY caution when im around ANY guy *even my own family*.. i lock my door at nite..<br>  <br>  on numberous occations my g-ma and my mom have said things in front of me and my younger brothers like "i dont wanna live any more","theres no point in living", or "if i had a gun round now id blow a hole in my head"...makes me cling to there every moment && i hate guns and sharp objects of ALL kind in anybodys hand but mine<br>  <br>  my mom will pull my hair and yell at me until i give her what she wants the cell, the computer, w/e she might be saying and she always calls me a fu*kin brat ans dumba**, and if i say the wrong thing she"ll slap me in the face<br>  <br>  i just recently found out the only guy i consider my DAD(my g-pa) wished i had been aborted<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  all of this if you acctually read it makes me feel like all you have in this life is yourself. every will hurt you some way or another. and it has changed me because i use to be this sweet loving bubble little girl and now ive grown up WAY to fast into a mom(to my brothers) who gaurds her heart and dont treat a single person on this earth.|`|LspDWYvOaa	I had a best friend, then I began to hate her. We 'broke up', and she never stopped telling lies and making fun of me and such. She bossed me around all the time when i was her friend and made me feel like ****. But it changed me in a good way. I don't care what people think anymore, and it's the freest feeling in the world.|`|p5Rpk9Y3aa	I told my old ''friend'' something I shouldn't have so she's always holding it against me even though she promised she wouldn't tell anyone yet she has. So it's hard for me to trust people now. And what the very first person said is the same also for me.|`|MFMaX2b1aa	When my dog died that I had since I was 6.

I don't trust any court system.|`|Y2k81CWWaa	Before I start, I'm in 8th grade and this started in the middle of 7th.<br>  <br>  So I was at a pet store with my mom, we were picking out a dog, and I was holding it. It was squirmish and it jumped out of my hands. It broke a leg. I was so upset and thought it was my fault, and I made the biggest mistake of my life by telling ths guy I thought was my friend. He twisted it around and told THE WHOLE SCHOOL that I killed that dog. Ever since he said that every day I get called a dog killer. People ask me, "So, why did you kill the dog?" and "How did you kill it?" They never ask me if it's true, they just ASSUME that it is. I hate assumptions. Teachers pity me, because they see it happen and pretend to care, doing nothing about it. I've lost friends because apparently they don't want to be friends with someone who harms animals. At least 50 times a day I get called a dog killer. I've had people throw dog poop at me and say I deserve it and people constantly calling my house, leaving nasty messages. It's the worst thing ever. I get so much crap from people about a lie. And NO ONE ever gets punished for this! Remeber, this still happens and gets worse every day and started over a year ago.<br>  <br>  It changes me because it made me realize that sometimes you should keep things to yourself, and that if your friends believe a rumor over you, then they're not your real friends.|`|IiML4zYpaa	So, this year my ex best friend was so mean to me. She talked about me behind my back and ditched me to hang out with other friends. I was so upset. She would lie and use me. I ended up ditching her this year. I couldn't take her anymore. She was doing this since the middle of 7th grade and we are high school now.  I didn't have hardly anyone in my classes to be friends with. My other bff was in another class. Now, I just ignore her and her annoying friends. She tries to make up rumors about me now because I was talking to this really amazing guy that she liked. She made up lies about me making out with other guys. She also made up that I was calling my guy a 'D0u** bag ,a d!**, and a fu(k3r"  and I never did. It's because I don't pay attention to her anymore. So, if she starts anything else, oh, she'lll get it from me:D<br>  loll.<br>  <br>  <br>  AND: I had this boyfriend all last year. I was dating him for about 1 year and 1/2. He made me change my views on guys. If I didn't do what he wanted he would get really amd and yell at me. Since it was only my first real die hard boyfriend, I put up with it. Then I told one of my best guy friends. I ended up breaking it off. He hurt me so much. He now blames it on his family life. It's still hard for me to trust guys beside my guy bff. It's hard. Stupid :P<br>  <br>  In 8th grade, these girls sent me IM's saying I fat and all this stuff about my family and me. I turned partly depressed for a while. :P   I never told anyone until this year. I still don't know who the girls were...hmm... Oh well(:|`|A3zAXntxaa	Nothing really bad has happened to me, <br>  but my heart goes out to those who have<br>  had terrible things happen to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The most that's happened to me..<br>  I was bullied through out middle school, (people called me a lesbian, and said I ate people.) and everyone would always laugh at me.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's not even that bad, and I feel stupid for even saying that since other people have had to deal with so much more.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	all of my friends backstabbed me in 5th grade. i literally had one friend left, and she didnt (and still doesnt) go to my school.<br>  <br>  that changed me for the better because i know how to stick up for myself.<br>  and plus, i went to a private school after that happened and met some of the best friends EVER! :)|`|LTWlBSFNaa	every one in my grade started hateing me. because of a few roumors it  made me strong|`|NSXGQBkAaa	I don't know if this is the worst that's happened to me, but I was head over heels for this one guy, but I didn't think he felt the same, so I gave up. Later, I still liked him, and found out that he did like me, but not anymore -_- Now if I really like someone I go for it and risk rejection.<br>  <br>  Yeah... I don't really have much in my life to complain about :/|`|r0ISrLc1aa	my parents got divorced when i was like 3 months old, they went to court to fight over custody of me when i was 4, again when i was 11, and forced me to pick sides. now my dad is getting divorced again and im 17. i just sum it all up as one big horrible experience, lol.<br>  <br>  its changed me in a lot of ways..i have a bad relationship with my dad, i dont know how to be in a relationship with guys. id rather have a drunken hookup then a relationship. but i also got my little half brother and half sister out of it, and i love them :)|`|ynAXDyQDaa	I have a few. <br>  <br>  My dad was a drug addict/alcoholic and also very abusive and he used to burn me with cigarettes and just hurt me, and then my mom got full custody of me. That has made mine and my mom's relationship amazing because she saved me. <br>  <br>  <br>  My mom's ex-boyfriend whom we lived with for 5 years randomly told us we had 3 days to pack up and leave. I was just starting to like him too. It was taught me to not rely on anybody to take care of you and always be there for you. I also learned how to pack everything I need in 15 minutes Lol.<br>  <br>  My mom had skin and breast cancer. I was too little to remember when she had skin cancer, but when she got breast cancer, it hit me HARD. I isolated myself for about 6 months and just hit rock bottom. She was a single mom at the time and if I lost her, I lost everything. Luckily, she is a cancer SURVIVOR =]  This experience taught me a greater meaning of life, and to not take it for granted. <br>  <br>  <br>  It's our life experiences who make us who we are. =]|`|p25p9jTYaa	my family and i drove our house boat to sandpoint to see a concert, and after the opening act, i was tired. we had anchored our boat out in the middle of the lake, and taken the dinghy to the beach. so my dad and i were going to go back to the boat, and come back for my mom and brother and his friends later. when we got in the dinghy, we say the water was really bad and there was a storm brewing. So we were watching a movie, and all of the sudden, the generator goes out. So we had NO electicity. Then out of absolutley nowhere, the wind starts blowing and it starts pouring rain. so then then we are blowing around the bay, and we are dragging our anchor around, we can't get the achor up, the thing that pulls it up was jammed, so we had to cut the 2,000 dollar anchor off. Then when that was cut loose, we crashed into the rocks, and there were some drunks out cheering us on for some reason. Then we crash into someone's REALLY nice dock, then we fly back out into the middle of the bay, and the right engine goes out. finally the storm dies down, and we hit the nice dock again. <br>  <br>  I learned: Cut the anchor FIRST. lol, no, I seriously thought i was going to die, and i was arging with my brother, and i was worried that i would never get to apologize to him, so i learned to always try your best to get along with everyone, because you might ust die someday without getting to apologize. But still, I also learned to cut the anchor first. lol.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I got pregnant at 16, my mom made me have an abortion...<br>  <br>  I stayed with my boyfriend and we got married when I was 18, now I'm 20 and we're expecting a little boy...<br>  It's been really hard on me because I always wonder what it would have been like to have another baby.

You have to understand that moving in this economy is also extremely scary.  It's extremely hard to sell and even more expensive to buy.  Maybe she wants to move too but she can't because of money problems.  Take this into consideration too.|`|Bw18seFqaa	your mom probably doesnt have the MONEY to move..  seriously another rental will mean deposit and first months rent, which will be at least $1,000 or more..  the cost of moving..  just to get a small rental u-haul to move across town will cost $300-400, plus the gas.|`|0xiHNsmVaa	Sounds bad, show her the crime rates and stuff maybe she'll consider it.|`|z6OqBkBGaa	just tell ur mom that u dont feel safe in the neighborhood and ask her if she would even think about moving|`|tjMTiAXoaa	Tell your mom how scared and insecure you are to live there.

It's cute, but just a little too old-fashioned for my taste. I can picture an elderly lady named Eloise, but not so easily a child and even less so a teenager. I prefer Elise or Elissa - perhaps even Elizabeth. But if you do decide to use Eloise, then that's very pretty as well and Ella is just the prettiest nickname ever for Eloise. (:|`|7YWsEbWfaa	too cute! :) ithink the nicknames elle and elly would be most appropriate|`|gu1sEQN8aa	It sounds bratty|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Love it! So cute|`|pl7lWGZDaa	It reminds me of those movies, Eloise at the Plaza..<br>  I think you should try Elizabeth, that way she could be called Ella, but also Libby, Lizzie, or Ellie..

BQXg09m9aa	Oh my goodness! That is a lot of drama!<br>  <br>  I think I would have to do the same thing honestly. I think it's good that you guys had the guts to stand up for that little boy, after your husband had been threatened. I probably wouldn't have punched the sides of the door. Although, it was neccesary, the man has a reason to report your husband in then. But, atleast the car stopped!<br>  <br>  God bless you guys, real saints! I hope the little boy is ok.|`|AA12145826	I would have done exactly what you had done. There are a lot of reasons people tell themselves in situations like this that rationalize their lack of action ("I could be hurt", "I'm sure it just a child acting up", "Its none of my business", "I don't want to get involved in a family dispute", "What could I do to help?", etc.). As the wife of a firefighter who has no problem stopping to try and offer assistance at every fender bender, I've seen some pretty amazing things when it comes to a lack of action or sheer avoidance of action.<br>  <br>  Hopefully once everyone was calmed down the situation was able to be resolved in a way that didn't traumatize the child. I still believe you and your husband did the right thing.|`|ZCSOJUYVaa	When it comes down to a childs life I would have done the exact same thing. Being a mommy our instincts kick in like that, and If that would have been one of my little boys screaming I would have pounded that window in. The important thing is to remember that yall are safe, and only you can hope the same for that child. But you definitely did the right thing!!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I would have knocked your husband out ..kids cry kids tantrum out. Who does he think he is Superman?  Unless you see a kid being abused ,Mind your own business.
AA10556677	My answers<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter.<br>  Your friend's MySpace pictures have nothing to do with you. If she wants to post pictures of herself in short shorts and rolled-up t-shirts, it's really not your business unless they start attracting creeps. <br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  If you want to lose weight, your friend is probably an excellent person to support you. If you don't, that's fine. But regardless, stop blaming her for it. It really has nothing to do with you, just like the MySpace pictures.<br>  <br>  Long answer...<br>  Your dad has no confidence in you because he has no reason to be confident in you. You admit to being "not good in school." If you know this, he knows it too. And he's not too pleased about it, from what it sounds like. Look. Your dad isn't the problem. You are the problem. You're the one who ditched homework for the mall. If you want him to lay off, try doing your homework for a change. Love may be unconditional, but respect isn't. Try doing your homework for a change.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	1. no one that age should take those kinds of pics......ewww<br>  <br>  2. feel good about yourself give yourself more credit. she has nothing you need or want.<br>  <br>  3.tell him it hurts when you. he probably does not want to hurt you.<br>  <br>  4. crack down on your school work if your not............|`|p25p9jTYaa	your friend is definitely a skank, but you shouldn't be so mean to her, because she's not bragging about it or anything,<br>  it is a LITTLE dumb to be jealous of her, but you are definitely not stupid.<br>  Tell your dad it's just going to make you fail if he says stuff like that, because you will start thinking like that, and if you think, you do.<br>  <br>  Aren't you the girl from that one "What has weed done for you?" commercial? you look kind of like her.|`|AA11296427	1 ) Build a bridge and get over it.

Love what you got. =) There are people who'll be jealous of you. Like me, your pic looks amazingly pretty, and I would never have the courage to be like that to my dad. Even though I kinda hate him too.<br>  <br>  Three, just prove him wrong. Your bound to him by blood, and DNA, you can't change that. At your grad, be like, "Well, I guess I did make it, huh?" At my school you get to say like three or four sentences on your year, or whatever. If your school does that just say what you did, "Thanks for your faith in me Dad, your assumptions of my failure pushed me to work harder." <br>  <br>  I'm 13 too.|`|bfQfeUq5aa	I'm 13 too so I guess I can help.<br>  I think this is annoying of your friend, but I think she is just exited because of her gret accomplishment. <br>  I think being jealous is not the right think.... instead you should be happy for her no matter what you are thinking in your head.<br>  What you should do with your problem with your dad is:<br>  My brother is sort of in the same situation, so I know what you are going through (sort of). I think you should sit and tlk with him and say that wha he is saying is lowering your confidence so thats causing you to to worse in school. Also, I think that he is just preparing you for the worst..... if you really are doing that bad. I think that some of the problem is you becasue you should pay more attention to your school work rather than your friends. I used to be the same way untill i hit 6th grade I used to not care but now I realized that middle school is important to your high school and your high school is a BIG impression for collage! It is sort of a chain reaction because of how much effort you put into education! Put a little bit more effort each day and before you know it you will be a strait A student!!!!! Also, in school take as many notes as you can and ask any question you might have becasue all that knoledge will help you that much more after school during your homework! In addition, do your school work the second you get home so you can get it over with... thats what I do. I hope I helped and good luck with school!|`|BSockNx7aa	Ignore your friend<br>  But that's not nice that your dad does that<br>  Maybe talk to you mom<br>  and togethr talk to your dad<br>  or write him a letter.|`|1ikl5q97aa	im in the same situation hunnie , but i am planning on changing my weight , i am planning on working out over the summer , you should do the same then show off to your friend and tell her that you are skinny too :) as far as your dad i am in the same situation but i am already in high school . to be honest with you middle school isn't all that important its mostly high school because that's what people look at when your trying to get a job , so just get better than an F and you aren't going to be held back or anything .

xue72D76aa	I would sit down and discuss it with him and come up with a way to compromise.  You or he can generate a list of names that you like and then the other person can veto names off the list.  You can then debate about the names you have left (all of which should be names you both like).  If he's dead-set on Henrick, you might vie for it to be a middle name instead of a first name.  Good luck!|`|23MPcnNqaa	Well, I hope you two are just seriously disagreeing and not actually fighting over this.  When I was pregnant with my twin boys, me and my husband disagreed a lot on the names.  It was so hard and stressful to pick two names for our boys.<br>  <br>  We got through it though, as will you and your husband.<br>  <br>  Would you consider using Henrick for a middle name?<br>  <br>  Just try not to stress too much.  There are so many names out there, I'm sure you two will eventually find one that yous can agree on.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and best of luck to you!!<br>  <br>  By the way....I love all 3 boys names you picked out, as well as the baby girls name.  :-)|`|dN5BJeVpaa	My husband is part Russian, and his early name suggestion was Maksim. I was appaled, and he wouldn't let down for a long long long time. I ended up having a huge fight with him and my mother in law over the name. Ugh. It was all so frustrating. I know just what you're going through. <br>  <br>  Well, ask him why he's so set on it - if it's after him, or his direct family, you might have less of an arguement. <br>  After that, try to compromise. Ask for Noah Henrick, or maybe even Henry Ethan until something is settled on. <br>  <br>  If push comes to shove, you might have to settle for Henrick Noah/Ethan/Liem and make his middle name be the manditory nickname.|`|chiFCUC5aa	we had the same problem except my husband was set on "THOR" i was mortified and would tell people he was kidding when he said thats what we were naming our son.  have you looked at other russian names.....just tell him that you both need to agree on the name you choose. its very important to. or tellh im you just plain hate it and its not happening. could you settle for it as a middle name? I have a son "Louie Thor" but at least i can introduce him as Louie and he thinks its the coolest name ever....boys what can you do? He may not like leim ethan or noah so if thats the case you have to agree to not name your son that either you both need to like the name...try getting a baby book that has the definitions and origin my husband like louis after he found out it meant gods warrior. or something like that.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i had the same problem the solution,-<br>  we each compiled a list of ten names we liked, traded lists and crossed off ones we absolutely hated, and circled ones that were "maybe's" and continued that until we cam e up with 2 or three names we both agreed on. its really fun and gets the job done with no stress! hope that helps! good luck!|`|DxoodgOtaa	ask him if he would like being named henrick. its such an ugly name. or you can compromise. tell him that you can do henry as a middle name.

My husband and I disagreed on every single name I'm surprised my daughter wasn't named baby girl. Don't worry the nurse will be asking you what you would like to name your lovely baby. You have the final say. Maybe you could come up with a list of names and ask your husband which ones he likes and then go from there. Or hopefully you'll have a girl and won't have to worry about the baby being named Henrick.|`|W85IdGzvaa	Try having a conversation with him about why he would prefer one name over another and why you prefer one name over another instead of arguing about specific names.  You may find out it is incredibly important for many, many actual reaasons for him to get to pick the name. And maybe he'll understand your point of view also. <br>  <br>  Offer up Henrick as his first name, but call him by his middle name.|`|RVxI2cR5aa	heathen would be a cute boy name:]<br>  its kinda sorta a mix of ethan and henrick.. kinda lol<br>  but try mixing names together that you both like. yous could come up with cute names together:]<br>  but i agree.. henrick.. such and old man name >.<|`|75BjjIEXaa	UR THE ONE WHO IS BEARING THE BABY, THUS, UR THE ONE TO CHOOSE UR BABY'S NAME!!!

Then trade lists, cross off ones you can absolutely not live with and star at least three you can. Compare and see if have any in common, if you each list twenty or more names there's a good chance you'll like at least one that he does. You could also tell him that Henrick isn't even a Russian name, by tradition (German or Swedish, mainly). Just let him know you're distaste and see if he'll compromise to use it as a middle name or find a variation you can both agree on like Henry or Richard. Or, you can just hope and pray you have a girl.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i fought with my bf also on boy names<br>  good thing we agreed eventually because we found out its a boy<br>  <br>  anyways<br>  i told my bf lets not fight because neither of us will win. we must both agree on a name<br>  <br>  we both went through lists and lists of names and then we came across "diego"<br>  <br>  we werent really sure on it so i said lets just "sit" on it for a little bit and see what we think. eventually we started calling my belly diego all the time and fell inlove with the name<br>  <br>  tell your hubby you would like a name you BOTH CAN AGREE ON...take your time.. alot of people dont decide on names until the baby is born to see what the baby looks like<br>  <br>  edit: my bf is spanish so he was inlove with spanish names i couldnt pronounce..main reason it was so hard for us. lol we also had to think about my family when pronouncing the names...my dad cant speak a spanish accent if his life depended on it|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Don't worry just yet because you don't know what your having...but if you do find out your having a boy then I would say.. you get to choose ( either way ) I mean don't make it a name that he despises but hey..your the one that has to go through pregnancy/labor/birth and most likely most of the sleepless nights after wards...I say you choose.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	i dont like liem or noah ... ethan is ok ... henrick is ok too ... mabe henrick could be a middle name?

5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	If he'll drink more, let him drink as much as he likes. Babies are really good at regulating their weight so don't worry about him eating too much. He'll crack it or turn away or spit out the formula when he's had enough.<br>  <br>  Try to get a night feed in though. At that age their tummies empty very quickly.. (we'd usually let our daughter sleep when she was about two weeks old and she's fine).|`|CmnnfJEDaa	i just had a look on the formula tin i give my son and at 11 days old it says they should be having roughly 3 to 4 oz every 3 hours. maybe offer a little more and see how your son goes.|`|aYacThofaa	yea my boy is 15 days and i went threw the same thing he is just hungry my boy was 8.8 pds. at birth and by now he's eating 4 oz. and is completely content|`|79kPBWMnaa	OKay I love this question. My babies were 8lb 11oz and 8lb 12oz, My most recent one was born in November and was barely drinking 2oz at the hospital by 2 weeks old was on 4oz and has been ever since and is now almost 3 months old. I DO NOT and NEVER have woke her to eat, and she is doing just fine. Enjoy it if your baby sleeps all night long, very few get that pleasure. please go up to 4oz and stop limiting his food, if you were hungry would someone limit you to 2 bites? He will stop eating when he is full.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Multiply your baby's weight by 2.5.  That is how much he should be having per day.<br>  <br>  2 oz would be high at that point, but also at this point the baby is gaining like gangbusters.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The amount should be continuously going up bit by bit. <br>  <br>  Do you know how to weigh him at home so you can calculate how much he needs?  Get on the scale, and then get on the scale holding him and subtract to get his weight.    <br>  <br>  consider that his stomach is as big as his hand, so if anything I would give him small amounts frequently if he still seems hungry.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a good article on how much to feed him at what age.

If a guys jeans are so tight they're outlining his junk even without a *****, I don't want to see it.<br>  <br>  Sagging boxers are gross.  A guy needs to be a gentleman.

D35xKICoaa	that is normal with clot that is the danger.so take it easy happy nine months..........|`|96HWpdkFaa	Alittle cramping is normal in early pregnancy as long as it doesn't hurt very much and is not with blood.<br>  <br>  Blood can be normal at early pregnancy..<br>  But anytime you have even a tiny amount of blood you need to go to the doctor to make sure.<br>  <br>  People can tell you "oh light bleeding is normal in early pregnancy" YES it is for some women but there are times when it can mean something bad! and no one on here knows your body and what's going on.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Cramping during early pregnancy is really common and fairly normal. I had it as well. But, if you are spotting, you should contact your OB because it could be a cause for concern. Don't be too alarmed though, this happens to a lot of women and things progress normally, but it would be best to have it checked out to figure out what's going on.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Spotting and cramping in early pregnancy is actually normal.  I would try to relax, if the cramping gets severe or the bleeding is more like a period then go to the ER.  Also I would call your doctor in the morning and tell them what is going on, they will probably have you come in and do an ultra sound, and then you will have peace of mind that everything is alright.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	put on a pad and see how much u will bleed in the next 24 hrs or so ... i had the same thing happen, at 12 weeks, no cramps tho, and the next day i woke up @ 4am covered in blood ... everythings fine, im still spotting, on bed rest still. but bleeding is not a joke, so definatelly keep an eye on it, and if u get more spotting go to the doc|`|jTkJbTc6aa	if its not really red but more brown then it could just be old blood...but call your dr just to be on the safe side....good luck =]|`|w1drJWKAaa	Yes, it's normal. <br>  <br>  So long as it's only a little bit of blood, and it's not heavy, or full of clots you shouldn't have much to worry about. It's still something that you should mention to your doctor though when you see him next.<br>  <br>  As for the cramping... I had cramps for the first two months of my pregnancy. It does go away though. But if it gets worse or brings you to your knees, you need to go to the hospital right away.

Your mom is just blinded by all the stuff you have thus making her belive your spoiled, when in reality your not. If you paid for that stuff its fine, and using holiday money is fine too, its your money, do what you want with it.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	No, it doesn't make you spoiled at all. You worked hard for that money and she didn't give you one penny of it. So, she has no right to tell you how to spend it.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Spoiled doesn't just mean you get everything you want. You can have a selfish attitude which is what she really means when she says spoiled.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	No, I don't.

But doesn't your school send progress reports to your parents? Are you sure they don't know. When I went to school they sent progress reports midterm. As far as bringing grades up, tell  your teachers your situation and tell them you want to change and you want to do better and you are wiling to work as hard as you have to in order to do better.|`|sfbwtlSXaa	Well what i would do is tell them the truth because telling a lie doesn't work out anything because after that they'll probably know sometime soon.

BY4ZVyRHaa	it'll get better in 2-3 weeks. but you must also make sure she is latching on correctly. if not it will damage the nipple. also you are filling with milk for the baby. once you start up on a smooth scedual your body will know how much milk to make. hang in there it'll all work out.|`|kouvKvjSaa	haha, when my son would cry, my nipples would start aching and leaking :-)<br>  i think your fine, if you make extra milk than all the better for you :-)|`|AI2VoFP4aa	chances are shes not latching on right. talk to a lactation consultant or start pumping and bottle feeding.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I think the aching you are describing is actually let-down, which is what you feel when your milk is released from your ducts to feed your baby.  It is totally normal.  Some people say it feels like a tingle, others like a warmth, but I felt it was a little bit uncomfortable, so I understand your description of it as an ache.  I do not think you need to mention it to your doctor.  Mastitis is extremely painful and accompanied by a fever.  Usually it is preceded by a blocked duct or nipple pore, both of which are extremely painful too and accompanied by swelling!<br>  <br>  Let-Down, from babycenter.com<br>  What are the causes?<br>  <br>  <br>  ? The letdown reflex<br>  <br>  You may experience fleeting pain in your breasts when your milk "lets down". The letdown reflex, also known as the milk ejection reflex, is caused by the action of the hormone, oxytocin. Oxytocin stimulates the muscles of the breast to squeeze out milk. In the first few days after the birth, the hormone is released in response to your baby suckling. Later, anything that makes you think about your baby, or feeding your baby, can trigger this hormone release. Some mothers find that their breasts leak when this happens.<br>  <br>  The letdown reflex feels different to different mothers. Some feel a slight tingling, some feel immense amounts of pressure and slight pain or discomfort and others feel nothing at all.<br>  <br>  Most mothers are unaware of the letdown reflex in the early days of breastfeeding, although they may be aware of "afterpains" - the pains experienced after birth as their womb contracts down to its pre-pregnancy size - which is caused by the same hormone. They may be more aware of the letdown when their baby is a few weeks old. As time goes by and breastfeeding becomes established, most mothers become less and less aware of it.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That's normal, it's that let down feeling and even now despite not nursing for 7 months now I still get that ache when I hear a baby cry.   If it were mastitis or something else it would hurt all the time, but it doesn't so you are fine.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	It could be poor latch or thrush or mastitis. Look at the glands on your areola carefully see if any are painful or swollen I had a chunk of grossness come out of one of mine. A duct had been clogged and that's how and where the clog came out. Definitely bring it up to your doctors visit and check your baby's mouth for thrush, mine had it and I didn't know it because it was on the roof of her mouth.
5wmrZEQ9aa	You count 2-3 hours from the start of the feeding.  I had to wake up my daughter to feed her.  She was a preemie, though, and was never interested in eating unless I prompted her.  She wouldn't wake hungry.  She also had a low birth weight, due to being premature, which is why I had to stick to a strict schedule.  Sometimes, I would finish a feeding, and have 30 minutes until the next one.  I remember thinking it was a HUGE relief when she went to eating every 3 hours.<br>  I would say unless your baby has a low birth weight and needs to gain weight, don't be quite so hung up on the scheduling.  2-3 hours is a guideline.  Sometimes your baby will want to eat every 1-2 hours when going through a growth spurt, and sometimes will go 3 and a half hours.  I was told not to go longer than 4 hours, even at night, until my baby was at least 2 months old, but again, she was a preemie, so that wouldn't apply to the average infant.<br>  As long as your baby is acting hungry and crying when hungry, then you can be flexible.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	You count from the time you begin feeding.  I dont remember why, but I am certain that is it.  But treat that as a MAXIMUM time between, not a minimum.  When my baby was in a growth spurt (first one about 5 weeks of age) I fed him every hour.  Good luck.  Growth Spurts are tough!!!!!|`|RPEL4Kyqaa	We did it from when the feeding stopped......that's what my husband and I were taught in the hospital and we were there for 5 days due to feeding isues....|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	I always counted it from the time of the ending of the feeding to the next time. Also, I nursed every two hours and it was usually on demand. I've always let my daughter tell me when she is hungry, she is the one who knows. Even now, at 17 months, we sit her down for three meals and a snack, but if she refuses her food after several attempts, we don't give it to her. She knows what she does and doesn't want.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	just feed her when she is hungry she makes the schedule
MfCkiJCVaa	Sounds fine to me.<br>  It's been scientifically proven that people who play video games that are complex, like gears of war and such, have higher IQs.<br>  <br>  It's normal for a 19 year old girl to be on her laptop that much. She's probably socializing there as well.<br>  <br>  It's much more common than you'd think.|`|10LIhgtkaa	You know, you sound like you WANT your parents to change that. You could probably do other things than hang on the interenet for that long. Maybe take up a hobby, like scrapbooking :-P<br>  <br>  That's normal gaming time for anyone, anymore than that and it gets to be a little much.|`|15423591314a80b690eb6deb8aaebcb4aa	Sounds like a bit much, but as long as they keep up with activities, schoolwork, and chores, shouldnt' be an issue.|`|1a8f556a514b8f836795e2adfdcd3848aa	If they spend that much time online when do they get everything else done?|`|P544Sbmqaa	Well, with the 19 year old's internet usage, remember she is in college.  A TON of college homework can be done on the internet.  I am going back to school right now, and they totally expect you to have internet access and to do a lot of your work on the comp.  We have a site where the teachers put up assignements and resources and hand outs and we are expected to check the site and utilize the online resources during our homework.<br>  <br>  I dont like violent video games, but...<br>  <br>  If they are keeping their responsibilities and have normal social lives, I would not worry.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	When do they sleep?|`|FEhmNTL2aa	Sounds like you have good kids, kudos!  But, yes, even being good kids, I wouldn't allow that much time to be wasted.  Instead of xbox and online stuff I'd rather they practice sports or study or help around the house.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	as long as their doing what they need to do.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I am online probably 10-12 hours a day.  But I am 20 years old, on the dean's list at my school, maintaining a stable and happy relationship, and I go out and have fun when I feel the need to get out.  I watch a little TV here and there, and I love to read, I do that a lot too.  I don't really see why it matters if they're still doing the things they're supposed to and they're still well rounded.  I probably wouldn't be nearly as educated as I am if I didn't spend so much time on the internet.  While I do spend lots of time socializing online, I research a LOT, too.<br>  <br>  In response to the person below me:<br>  <br>  I do at least 2 hours of volunteer work every week-- physical, hard volunteer work handling stray dogs.  I am a learning disabled student and still maintain a 3.6 GPA in college that is climbing.  My room is clean.  I have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend.  I am on the school paper, student activities board, and on rotoract-- and I have friends in all of these clubs.  I work out for 2 hours 5 days a week.  I take an average of 16 credit hours of school each semester, and I get 8 hours of sleep every night.  I study 4-8 hours a day.  I still spend 10-12 hours online every weekday and some days on weekends.  Maybe not always consecutively, and depending on the kind of work I am doing I might multitask recreation and work if it's the sort of work that will allow that, but it seems to me if I'm phi theta kappa material I'm in pretty good shape!|`|wZAeBisbaa	Assuming that's all recreational use for the 19 year old, I think it's way too much.  Full time college usually requires at least 8-10 hours a day of classes and homework.  If you add recreational soccer, social life, family activities, and chores, that should take another 3-4 hours, at least. If you get 8 hours of sleep and spend another hour or so on showering and grooming, you're up to 21 hours a day.  That leaves about 3 hours for recreational computer use.  If you're doing 6-8, something else is being neglected.  <br>  <br>  For the 14 year old, I would keep the Xbox to less than 3 hours and make sure s/he's getting 9-10 hours of sleep.

b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	the best sippy cup that makes the transition a breeze is done by nuby - it's colored transparent plastic with soft rubber tip.. so the tip is different in shape from the regular bottle's nipple but it's soft, so the baby will easily figure out what to do with it :).. i have gotten the regular sippy cups with hard plastic tips but all my baby would do is try and munch on them and then start crying because no milk was flowing out.. also, hard tips can hurt your baby's mouth.. why not make a nuby bottle as a standard one? i will never know :).. also, do not compare your baby to your friends babies - i know, it's hard not to but try and refrain from that because you have to work at your baby's pace - not at someone else's baby.. or are you telling me that the other baby is smarter than yours?.. i didn't think so :)|`|5H5iQfW4aa	let your baBY BE A BABY YOU SHOULDNT GIVE HIM A SIPPY CUP INTILL HE IS AT LEAST 9 MONTHS|`|bql2RJzWaa	Try a Nuby sippy cup. It has a rubber spout. Similar to a bottle, but yet it is shaped like a spout.|`|UAJjnsBuaa	uhhhh yeah stay with a bottle till' he is just a -little- more controlled :)|`|GU3RauKOaa	Its okay that you want him to start learning to use a cup. My daughter who is breastfed, not bottlefed, could use a sippy cup at 4 1/2 months perfectly (one with the two handles, but I removed the nospill valve so the flow was easier). <br>  <br>  The thing is that babies really have a need to suck on something and if you take away the bottle that early he will probably need something to fulfill that sucking need until up to age 2 (thumb, pacifier, etc.). So while I think its great to work on his motor skills and give him a cup now (maybe with 2 oz. of water or when he's a bit older do an oz of juice with an oz of water), don't be surprised if you can't get the bottle away and don't try to force him.<br>  <br>  Like many said, the Nuby sippy cup is great, it has a latex sippy cup lid which is like a cross between a nipple and a cup. Also, the ones with two handles are easiest to hold and if he has trouble getting the liquid out you can remove the no spill valve. It might drip a little but it will be easier.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Its a little ridiculous to think that your baby will be weaned to a cup by 7-8 months. Whats most important at this stage is that your baby gets all the milk he needs, and the best way of doing that is by a bottle for now. I would suggest introuducing a cup around 7 months for extra fluids your baby needs once on solids, like very diluted juice and water. If your baby is really advanced and you are confident that he will get all the milk he wants, you can start replacing milk feed with a cup around 9 months but most parents don't start that until close to 12 months.|`|CmnnfJEDaa	my son is 11 months and im still having trouble getting him to use a sippy cup. he quite cant understand with the non spill sippy cups that he has to bite down on the straw and to suck at the same time. so i just got him a normal sippy cup that isn't non spill or anything like that and now takes it easy.|`|AA10441395	My son is 8 months, and just getting the hang of the sippy cup, even though he was self feeding by 6 months. We started by taking the stopper out of the lid.|`|79kPBWMnaa	That is kinda early, My first girl let me know when she was ready.<br>  1.Able to sit without help<br>  2. Holds bottle completely and can pick it up if it falls<br>  3. Doesn't gag when feeding<br>  <br>  you don't wanna rush them. My daughter was 9 months when we got the nuby sippy cups they are soft and really helped and by 10 1/2 months she was on a sippy. Doctors say as long as they are off the bottle by 1 year then they are on track.
in6Iw3BEaa	When people go through extraordinary measures like surrogacy or embryo adoption, it makes me wonder what the driving force is, where their priorities lie.  As many people have mentioned before, when people adopt, it's usually because of an unplanned pregnancy that had nothing to do with the APs.  With embryo adoption, an adoptee is created.  In a lab.  In a petri dish.  I will never go beyond IVF and if I have embryos left over, they will be donated to science.  I honestly can't think of one thing that is right about embryo donation.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	So what do you think of all those people who criticized a woman who chose to have embryo's that are biological hers and her former husbands and produced eight babies? Should she have given some of them up because not everyone agreed with her choice? Or should those kids lives have meant nothing and gone into a waste bin to satisfy societies version of normal. Tough call isn't it.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	So wrong. Wrong wrong wrong.<br>  <br>  Even the Pope thinks so|`|LvIdDC93aa	I dont feel as if there is anything wrong with it.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	There are so many eggs harvested and then thrown out because people split up, or become pregnant, or various other reasons.  I think that a couple who's gone through the infertlity processes might be more likely to place an embryo for adoption.  The stress is not like giving birth hormonally, although there can always be the thoughts of "where is the child I created?". <br>  <br>  I think that we need to work on legally enforceable adoption before this goes much further.
jFrzBCeuaa	Sorry but you can get served for a noise complaint (3 day demand) and if it doesn't get better than you can get evicted. I can't imagine that your baby is bad enough to disturb your neighbors though. Inform your landlord of the situation so that they can let your neighbors know. Good luck to your little one.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	So sorry to hear what is going on. I will say a prayer for you and I hope all goes well. I don't know if she can legally do that but have you tried talking to her about the situation? Maybe you can write a letter to all your neighbors and explain the situation to them. They should understand. Sometimes it just takes a little explaining to do. Good Luck & God Bless the both of you.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i believe thats descrimination.  contact the housing authorities in your area and ask them.  i had that problem in one apartment they said they can charge fines for excessive noise after a certain time if the neighbors complain.  I told them i cant control a baby crying.  i can do my best to sooth them but there is no magic off button.  and if they wanted me to pay fines then they would have to show me exactly where  in my lease agreement it said about noise.  so they copied my lease and highlighted a section.  but the section saying i could get fined for late night noise said for music and stuff like.  I told them they would have to sue me for the fines because it wasnt included in the clause they hightlighted or evict me.  needless to say the judge wouldnt sight the eviction notice.  I moved as soon as i could because i didnt want landlords like that.|`|MfCkiJCVaa	She has no legal right to raise your rent based on that. And if you pay her the rent you normally pay and she continues to accept it, she can't legally evict you. If she accepts any money from you she can't evict you, and since you have a child under 6 years of age she can't evict you. You're pretty safe. =)|`|7PXFXcKfaa	awww im sorry ... <br>  <br>  your landlord cant do that ... its so cruel.<br>  <br>  why not talk directly to your neighbour!? tell them about the foot story and apologize, and they will feel sooo guilty! <br>  <br>  your baby will be ok ,,, dont worry and dont be sad!|`|QonKveQEaa	I'm really shocked at your neigbours and manager especially!  I don't think they can evict you for the baby crying, seriously, what kind of people make a stink about a new mom's baby?! <br>  But I will make a suggestion:  <br>  You should write several letters on nice stationary that say something like this:  <br>  <br>  Dear Neigbour,<br>  My name is (your name) and as you may know, I have a new baby.  He needs surgery on his foot, so he has been crying a lot and being really fussy, but he's a real fighter.  <br>  I know that you must be hearing all the crying going on and I want to apologize for all the noise.  <br>  I ask for you to show us patience while we go through this difficult time, and please know that your understanding is greatly appreciated.  <br>  <br>  We really love living here in this community and our neighbours too!    We are so sorry to be inconveniencing you all with this noise, but please bear with us.  It will only be while we get through this.  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  (your name)<br>  your neighbour.<br>  <br>  It's worth a shot!  Good Luck!|`|wwPx6Wm6aa	u need to check the renter rights of ur state. u could call the local police and they can explain ur rights as a renter also.<br>  <br>  my first child had surgery on her right foot to correct club foot. we made it through and though it may be hard, everything happens for a reason. u'll be ok|`|JbKPj42Uaa	aww thts so sad and no its not leagl for her to kick u out because its natural for babys to cry u can sue her if she kicks u out <br>  its not right for her to do tht<br>  and ur baby will b fine dont worry=)
i3pn4jNcaa	stretch marks never go away. they're a scar so they will stay with you forever. but if you want them to be less noticeable keep them moisturized. dosent matter if its cocoa butter or Vaseline as long as theres something on them. also drink lots of water. sometimes the reason for stretch marks is because you aren't hydrated and when your skin is growing it dosent have as much elasticity because your dehydrated.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Absolutely normal.<br>  My boobs are only a 36b and I have stretch marks :(<br>  <br>  You're not alone, rofl.  IT SUCKS.  They will fade within a few months, probably.  This stuff called "bio-oil" works pretty well, I bought it and used it on my legs before I went to Hawaii and it helped my stretch marks fade pretty well.<br>  <br>  Good luck :p|`|8RfmosODaa	Yep I had/ still have some stretch marks on my boobs, unfortunately my boobs didn't get bigger lol. I also got them on my belly and butt. I used Palmer's coca butter lotion for stretch marks. I think it helped some.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Yes, it is. Stretch marks emerge from a period of rapid growth, causing your skin to stretch. Which, as you said, is what happened to you. They should fade in time, just don't worry about it. Most people have them, but yes, they do go away by themselves.<br>  Good luck. x.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	yes theyre normal...and unfortunate :( i have 'em too.<br>  bleh. they suck.<br>  i cant wear a bathing suit without them showing... fjlksd<br>  i went from a 32B to a 34C. that's what did it.  and, unfortunately, theyre still growing!<br>  <br>  use lotion thats for pregnant mother's bellies (: it helps them go away.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Totally normal..........Cocoa Butter or Vitamin E oil can help|`|p8sMX245aa	yes thats normal. when you grow quickly in a short amount of time the skin stretches which causes stretch marks.<br>  <br>  lotion with cocoa butter helps to reduce them and it moisturizes well to help prevent stretch marks if you continue to grow.<br>  <br>  palmer's cocoa butter lotion is what i use. its around $5 at wal mart and it smells pretty good too :] if you want to get rid of the stretch marks completely a scar reducing product can help.|`|1ikl5q97aa	i had them when i was like 12 now i am 15 , so its great :) jk . Yea they will fade but YOU will personally still be able to notice them but other people won't . i hate mine but really nothing can make them go away , the lotion just helps fade the red but YOU are still going to notice them because your not going to like them so much .|`|dQKxTKs3aa	sorry sweety your stuck with them as unattractive as they are it is part of life. it happened due to your breasts getting larger and if the sag that causes the skin to stretch kinda like a rubber band only they were stretched to much and it caused the stretch marks. as far as them fading, wll dont hold your breath on that. lil word of advice from experiance...get use to seeing the stretch marks. SORRY|`|KJpFr9lKaa	its moer than normal.<br>  cocoa butter makes them go away a little bit.<br>  but theres nothing you can do to completely get rid of stretch marks|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Totally normal! ive got tons on mine. ive got some from when i had my baby 2yrs ago that are just now starting to fade|`|BSockNx7aa	yupp.<br>  cocobutter lotion.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yes its normal|`|AA11296427	Yes, because they tend to grow fast. <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|gkOkEZ9Oaa	TOTALLY normal. No way to get rid, but they will fade in about a yr or 2. Use coco butter lotion!|`|5yA0hdNyaa	YES!<br>  i have them..<br>  almost everyone, unless they're like a size A, has them.v(:
r9nxFkGtaa	If there is no good reason for his never having had a job (such as illness, mental problems, etc) then absolutely, I would have kicked him out.  He will never be a responsible adult unless he is forced to become one.|`|PIwP8DFxaa	yes|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	yes.  Both Mom & child have some problems,|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My dad, who is a complete loser, lived with his parents till the day they died. They all 3 lived in a one bedroom house that was so small, the kitchen was a HALLWAY that connected the bathroom to the living room. And guess who slept in the bed in the bedroom? Not his parents, oh no, that would have  been the respectful thing to do. They didn't throw him out because they knew after my mom tossed him out, that he would never have anywhere to go again. Being his parent's, they would rather sleep on the pull out couch bed, then have their son homeless.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	Do you EVER ask sincere questions? All your questions sound so trolly.<br>  <br>  No and yes.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	its not normal ..but it depends on if they are disabled ,,,if they are thn its fine if not then they should be working|`|SsfnitjXaa	My son is 39 and lives with us.  He has cerebral palsy.  I would never kick him out.  Perhaps this man has mental issues you do not know about.  Why does it concern you where he lives?|`|GUEsVdaFaa	Yes I say I would have kicked him out. I personally don't see a problem with kids living with their parents, as long as they know what responsibility is and they have the ability to keep a job.<br>   <br>  If a person is reliant on their parents and has never had a job, what will they do when it comes time for those parents to pass away? The person will have no idea how to take care of them self. It's bad parenting, and a major lack of responsibility on the child's part. It's the parent's job to prepare their children for life on their own. And never having a job is a terrible way to teach the child how to survive.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	It's punishment for himself to live with his mom.  While he's doing that, he's making it where he'll never build a retirement fund, and when she dies, he'll starve.<br>  <br>  It's also not normal, unless he has some real mental issues and is already considered disabled because of this.|`|T0pkW783aa	No, it is not acceptable.  This is bad for both the parents and the kid (34 year old moocher), because he is being enabled to be nonproductive and irresponsible.  I'd give him a date and say he needs to be out on his own by then.  He would have been gone long ago if he were mine.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Unless the 34 year-old has a disability, it's not OK.  Worse, it's TRAGIC.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Definetely..... There has to be some serious dependency and anti-social issues there as afar as Im concerned.|`|axwdwiSuaa	yea, he's lazy and i definatly would have kicked him out way before 34!|`|a8i7NGu2aa	Well yeah. I mean if you never make him go out on his own he'll act like a kid for the rest of his life.|`|14JQ11AUaa	No it is not ok and yes I would have kicked him out more than 10 years ago!!!|`|1os95dHZaa	We live in a stressfull world now a days its scarry to go out into the big bad world and face infearior beings! <br>  Tina is right, Byron promised to try to look for a job tomorrow to help her and I with his 8 children and one on the way. <br>  Tina don't forget to clean his car off in the morning or you know he wont go! I already got his scrathchers and smokes there on the table!|`|RSczEcZCaa	I think it's ok to live with your mom at your age but even if you are filthy rich, wouldn't it be COOLER if you find a job  of your own? Get to meet other people, get a career that you will actually love. you may find yourself more happy and fulfilled and your mom proud!|`|ylB9S2Y9aa	Depends. If the kid is disabled or other circumstances keep him from working, that's one thing, but if he is honestly just too lazy he needs to get a job and learn to support himself.|`|Wa1kwOHkaa	Depends on the circumstances.  Obviously if he was crippled and can't leave the bed and needs constant medical attention, yes.  But any other alternative, he should be living on his own at this age.|`|5eSSAT69aa	is this my future MIL? I beg you not to kick out Byron yet. He is trying to get a job. He plans to get up by noon to job hunt tomorrow.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	No, that is not ok. Being completely dependent on your parents at 34 years old is not healthy.<br>  <br>  Yes, I would have kicked him out 10 years ago.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Yes esp having no job.  Ever heard of the song by TLC "no scrubs"|`|RPoFBenJaa	NO its not right and YES i would kick him out. I would make him, literally make him get a job and I would find him an apartment and move his *** out!|`|rBwaAiYRaa	I thought Byron had a job!  He always rushes from the motel room as soon as the hour is up, saying that he has to go to work.  That bastard!|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	I'd have kicked him out faster than you could type that question.|`|Ks7lENScaa	No it isn't ok.  Well the mother allowed this mess.   People do what you allow.|`|G7LUOfIkaa	Do what you want, it's only wrong when society says it's wrong.  Which, in turn, is wrong.|`|gUYpvWUUaa	i have two older brothers, 27 and 28 that still live at my moms house. but at least they have jobs...they are waiters.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	Sounds sexy. Can you give me his numba?|`|gsem4EnYaa	wow|`|uqjEXAOmaa	sounds normal to me|`|vJf2DZhJaa	At the age of 34, I would think that a normal person in normal circumstances would want to be living on his own.<br>  <br>  There are circumstances, though that would be ok.  <br>  <br>  Is he helping to take care of his Mom?<br>  <br>  Is he doing his share in the household?<br>  <br>  Is he educated enough to get a job?<br>  <br>  I know several wonderful men who are living at the parent's house and take care of aging parents.  Usually, though, they have a job also.<br>  <br>  What would happen if mom decided to leave, or die.  Would the man be able to take care of himself in that situation?<br>  <br>  Parents do not help their children when they take care of them until it's too late for them to have a life of their own.<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone needs to be kicked out of the house, but I think the 34 year old needs to re-evaluate his life.|`|00792da82dde73ce69a0bb30ddb3220baa	It is okay, its a cultural thing.  If you believe in family first - why not?!?<br>  <br>  Have your adult children returned to the nest? <br>  Are you ready to help them get back on their feet? <br>  Are you prepared to lay down rules and protect your own financial stability? <br>  <br>  They're back. The "Boomerang Kids" — young adults who left to go to college, get married or just strut their independence — are moving back in with mom and dad. Boomerang Kids can be a mixed blessing for parents, both emotionally and financially. <br>  <br>  The trend is cyclical. Especially during tough economic times, adult children head for home. Census figures show that 56 percent of men and 43 percent of women ages 18 to 24 today live with one or both parents. Some never left, while an estimated 65 percent of recent college graduates have moved back in with their parents.("Returning to the Nest," The Baltimore Sun, February 29, 2004 web page: www.theeagle.com/businesstechnology/0229... "Boomerang Kids Keep Coming Home," CBS Evening News, January 9, 2004 web page: www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/08/eveni... <br>  <br>  The reasons are many, the first being economics. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10.9% of 20-to-24-year-olds were unemployed in September 2003 vs. 6.7% in September, 2000. The jobless rate for 25-to-34-year-olds had also risen to 6.3% from 3.7% over the period. That sent a lot of young folks back home. Plus, there is the matter of debt, especially college loans. For as many as 40 percent of recent grads, it made smart economic sense to move back in with their parents – where life is comfortable and rent is either low or nonexistent – while they get their finances in order. Then, of course, some return for personal reasons, to recover from a divorce or an illness, or just because they cannot afford their parents' lifestyle living on their own.("Mom and Dad, I'm Home - Again," BusinessWeek online, November 3, 2003 web page: www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03... <br>  <br>  Caution: Parents are often happy to help out, both emotionally and financially. As a result, the arrangement often works to everyone's satisfaction. However, there are risks, especially for the parents. These include family tension and misunderstandings, but also money.<br>  <br>  The return to the nest can become a financial burden that can derail the parents' plans and jeopardize their financial future, especially their retirement, as they try to do too much for their children. For example, if parents pick up a son's college loan, that payment is money not going toward their own retirement savings, very often at a time when the parents need to be stashing cash at an accelerated pace to meet retirement needs.<br>  <br>  Success Factors<br>  Studies show that the return to the nest works best when several factors are present: <br>  <br>  The boomerang kid pays rent or contributes to the household in a tangible way. (About half make a payment of rent.) <br>  The boomerang kid gets along with mom. (The relationship with the father seems to be less of a factor.) <br>  The return is temporary and a one–time event. (Children who repeatedly boomerang find that relations with parents worsen each time.) <br>  The parents are in a long–term marriage. <br>  The return is a safety net while the boomerang kid makes a transition, based on a clear–cut need. <br>  The boomerang kid is cheerful and good company. (Mothers, especially, like the company of the young person and see it as a benefit of the return to the nest.)("Boomerang Kids," by Mary Bold, Center for Parent Education, University of North Texas (2001). Web page: www.unt.edu/cpe/module1/blk5boom.htm.) <br>  <br>  How To Make It Work<br>  Most researchers agree that you as a parent can take steps to create a win–win situation: <br>  <br>  Set house rules. Put them in writing. Make it a contract. Remember, it's still your house. <br>  Set a departure date, whether it be three weeks or three months. <br>  Insist on responsibilities, which may include paying rent and/or payment in kind, such as taking on household chores – doing laundry, making dinner two nights a week, buying groceries. This can often be negotiated. One method is to ask the returning child what he or she believes would be reasonable rent. (This is also the area, when not clearly laid out, that can result in the most misunderstandings, as adult children return to old habits of expecting to be taken care of.) <br>  Help them restructure debts, rather than simply bail them out. Then teach them how to avoid new debt. One option is to match debt–reduction payments, with the understanding that they put away credit cards and live within their means. <br>  Do not sacrifice your own financial future. Decide how much you want and can afford to help. Children tend to think their parents are wealthy, while some parents provide more financial support than they can afford. Remember that your children have decades to build their financial security, while you may be only a few years away from your retireme|`|EDtcTBRQaa	Well..... he is pratically old so maybe he needs his mummy (tear)<br>  <br>  <br>  or wait he is so old i bet she wants him out.. haha no maybe he loves her but no job im real young and already have 1 haha. no lie!!! so dude i mean at least work at mcdonals it is accutally not bad. except the smell of meat but yea.... im a CHICKATARIAN!!!!!! no lie you should become 1!!!!|`|jzohbiioaa	Yes,  no offense.

b1WMcGQ0aa	I agree. You know you're doing the right thing, so just blow off opinions from extremists that you come across.<br>  <br>  Some people just have different opinions on drinking when you're a parent, but I'm with you on this one. We hardly ever get a chance to get out because..well... we have 2 kids and the only people I know to watch them are my grandparents who are in their 70's. <br>  <br>  But, we got to go out and see Brian Regan (a funny comedian), and we had a few drinks last month. Also, we're going to a concert next month, and you can bet that I'll have more than 2 drinks! :) Our kids will have a babysitter.|`|4JFtk1xqaa	I agree, I breastfed both of my children and occasionally I would pump and enjoy a glass of wine or two before bed and I waited until the next morning or afternoon to breastfeed so it would be out of my system. Nothing wrong with that at all. It is just not good to drink and then nurse your baby too soon is all.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Why  would you need a baby sitter if you only had 1 or 2 drinks...? i have had a drink before( after my child was in bed) and i never had to have a baby sitter. i dont drink to the point where im drunk or buzzed but i dont see a problem with having a drink while your baby is sleeping. As for your question why worry about it who cares what other people think.. what you do is none of their bussiness.|`|8fw3zE3gaa	A mom needs mom time yes. A night out is nice.  <br>  <br>  I have a beer or  wine like once or twice a week.  I personaly feel bad leaving my baby and I can only have 2 drinks I'm a light weight now man I useto be able to drink not any more. <br>  <br>  Going out once a month is fine but every week not cool.|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	As long as the alcohol is in your system you shouldnt breast feed. People are stupid to think you need to pump and dump. People rely on other websites and people because their to lazy to read the baby books, and ask their doctor.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I agree with you, mommys need a break! I did fine with one drink, i'm not talking about shots, i'm talking a beer or a glass of wine. I nursed my daughter two hours after, your liver can process one drink (one shot, one glass of wine ect) in an hour. I don't think women getting sloshed then trying to care for their children are a good idea, but who are we to judge one mother? We all do the wrong things all the time, no mother is perfect. There is NOTHING wrong with wanting to get out of the house and having some adult conversation, and having a beer or two. I'm sure you're not going to induce fetal alcohol syndrome with one night out!|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	Well, my son is 7 months old, exclusively breastfed and even with my birthday, new years, christmas, my friends 21st b-day etc.  I still have yet to have more than 2 drinks in one night and I can count on one hand how many times that has happened.  I also won't nurse my son for at least 3 hours from the time I  finished a drink, even if I only had one.  It's just not worth it to me.  But if going out and getting drunk is important to you, then do it and stop worrying about what everyone else thinks.  I have a feeling it's more the way they percieve your parenting than the fact that you breastfeed and drink.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	I was told by my doctor... safe to drive, safe to nurse.<br>  <br>  Alcohol does not store in the breast milk, it metabolizes in the milk as it does in the blood (so the pump and dump for 24 hours is a crock).<br>  <br>  <br>  i find i can have a drink or two or 3 even, right after my son nurses his last feeding before bed (7:30) ... and be fine for his 3:30 feeding.

Hang in there. I know it can be tough.|`|EyKJ737daa	Probably not sweetie, it is probably your anxiety and emotions that she feels from you.  Babies can sense when mum is upset.  If you have hubby's voice on an answering machine if you have one, it may be a good idea to play that every so often so she remembers his voice when he returns.  Same as if he phones, put the phone on speaker (if your phone has that feature) and talk to hubby as normal so she can still hear his voice.  She really is too young though to miss her daddy, it is your feelings that she is picking up on.  I hope your hubby returns soon and I hope your new little treasure settles for you too. Remember it's a whole new world out here that she is now getting use to.  Sounds are so much louder and clearer than they were in the womb. Give it time and she will come good too.  You also need to remember that hubby will return.

jFrzBCeuaa	Well it sounds like teething. Try some Tylenol or Motrin right before bed. She also could be hungry in the night since it is time for a growth spurt. If she is also tugging at her ear you might want to make sure that she does not have an ear infection.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	She's teething, it will go on for a while and then she'll get some teeth.   Then the next tooth will start to come in and it will continue.   It's not fun but it's what it takes to get teeth.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Sounds like a question for the doctor. Just give them a call and see what they think. Only takes about five minutes. Is she ok during the day? She needs to be seen. She could be teething but then again it could be something more serious. Is she congested or running a fever? If she is see the doc asap. She could just be teething but it is always better to be safe than sorry. Good Luck & God Bless|`|AA10312653	it sounds like teething..the gel works pretty well...i know its tought to get some sleep but the teeth have to come at some point|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Probably just teething, but it might be worth it to take her to the doctor to make sure she doesnt hvae somthing else wrong with her like na ear infection.|`|MfCkiJCVaa	aww...<br>  It could be teething, but a lot of times, that's everyone's solution to why a baby is fussing, and it's not it.<br>  Look inside her mouth and check for signs of thrush. they're little white spots on the inner cheeks, or roof of the mouth and gums, sometimes the tongue. If you see any, take her to the doctor to get some anti-fungal medication. <br>  If that's not it, it could be gas. It could also be colic. I thought colic was only possible in the first few months of life, but my ped told me i thought wrong.<br>  feel around her gums see if you feel any bumps. give her a cold wet wash cloth to chew on. that soothes my son's teething cries.<br>  <br>  <br>  also--- she might be hungry for some solid foods at 6 and a half months old. hence the sucking of the bottom lip and such.|`|BY4ZVyRHaa	my six moth old is doing the exact same thing. she is teething. she had a fever from it last weekend. all you can do is give then Tylenol drops for the fever and some baby oral-gel to rub on her gums to ease some of the pain.  she'll be fine also if you put a binkey in the freezer and give it to her helps as well. mine won't take a binky but when i do this she'll chew on it for a few mins. good luck|`|Q7lvSU03aa	It might be a growth spurt.  She would be crying because she is hungry.<br>  <br>  But it sounds like teething to me.  Look for increased drooling, mouthing things, and general fussiness.  For me the gel you put on their gums immediately calms my daughter down.  You could also try baby tylenol at night.<br>  <br>  If it continues I would see a pediatrician.<br>  Good luck!|`|W8ohh50aaa	She might be teething, or, she could also have an ear infection. Has she had a fever? Generally if her fever id below 100, it's more then likely her teeth, but anything above that she should be seen by a Dr for a possible ear infection.|`|wwPx6Wm6aa	she is being a infant. i have 3 little girls and trust me...female are brats. if she keeps it up i would talk to a doctor but she is probably just teething.|`|kouvKvjSaa	totally teething! my son did the same thing :-)<br>  the first time is always the hardest, well until her molars come, but anywho, she's totally teething :-)<br>  try some of the teething tablets... they usually work great :-)|`|chiFCUC5aa	it does sound like she is teething. the smacking the mouth and sucking her lip are good signs my son does the say thing you can give her tylenol. I usually give it to my son if teething rings dont work and he is irritable also before bed is a good time it helps them sleep a little better. also hylands teething tablets are great they are all natural made with coffee bean extract and chamomile and other things that help with gum inflammation  they work really well for my soon i know before he cuts a took hes usually fussy for 2 or 3 days and then the next day is fine and then usually the next i can feel a tooth. try giving her wet face cloths to suck on my son loves those he can really gnaw and suck on them or i also give him a peeled chilled carrot or celery but i watch him good in the high chair with celery good luck

lRq81lu7aa	My daughter has been doing the same thing!  Before, she would take 2 naps, now she is down to one 3 hour nap.  But she is also teething, so it may be that.  She sleeps fine at night.  I keep reading that babies know when they need more sleep, but I don't tend to believe that.  <br>  <br>  My daughter has dark circles under her eyes sometimes, so I do think she needs the extra rest during the day, and sometimes she does get a good nap in.  Hopefully someone else has some insight also.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you and I are not alone.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	there are just too many things happening in a baby's life, so it's hard to go to sleep when there are so many things to explore.. there's one thing that you have to always keep in mind - go at your baby's pace.. so now there's a change in her routine, so she's not feeling like taking naps - yes, it deprives you of one hour of peace and quiet, however, you have to listen to your baby.. there's one thing to watch out for: some babies will push you with the changes to switch the night and day (yes, they are creative alright).. so make sure that you keep an eye on the time and no naps after 3pm :)|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	It is bc she is learning & see & doing new things & doesnt want to miss a min of it|`|QTSsGbubaa	my daughter is now 10 months but for the past 6 weeks has been fighting me tooth and nail for bed and naps. it is very common|`|CmnnfJEDaa	my son is 11 months old and is going thru this stage also.<br>  unfortunately it got to the point that we had to do the crying out method for awhile. it eventually did work and now he knows to have a sleep when its nap time.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	he wants to be up and playing hes nosey my six month old is fighting nap time to|`|fHjSonssaa	My son is 11 months old and he has never been a big napper.  <br>  As he got older, he started to fight it more and more.<br>  <br>  And he definately skips a nap here and there.<br>  Sometimes I wonder who it's harder on, him or me?<br>  <br>  I don't do the cry it out method- it was accidently done once- when I thought he was sleeping- but he wasn't.  I went downstairs to clean bottles and didn't bring the moniter with me since he had JUST went down- normally I would have checked on him, but I just didn't think he would have woke up that fast- he was screaming like crazy- I have no idea how I didn't hear him.  He just cried harder and longer- so we have never tried that since and will never try it again.<br>  <br>  It can be a lot of work- and without a nap he can get to be a "crabby" boy.  But after trying everything EXCEPT letting him cry- I finally realized that I just have to give up.  I asked a question about this the other day- and have come to the conclusion that the right thing to do is to let him do what he needs to so- because nothing works short of giving him a sedative.  Which is obviously out of the questionn<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  I think patience is the best solution right now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
j7fzuDxgaa	hello there when my baby was little i found a nice bed time bathe helped him i used johnsons and johnsons baby bed time bath. and then a nice warm bottle i found that helped a great deal. and also if i had a nagging feeling he was going to wake and lack of sleep was stressing me i would wake him when i went to bed and give him a couple of oz just to top him up. or maybe your baby likes the suckling have you tried a soother/dummy, or maybe little bit of water.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	I have a baby like this too.  I suggest letting him cry a little and see if he goes back to sleep.  I never thought it would work, but my baby settles down after usually less than 2 or 3 minutes if I don't go get her.  <br>  <br>  If you at least consolidate the feedings into one or two at night, he will eat more and you won't go crazy.  <br>  Good luck!|`|jFrzBCeuaa	Teething? Ear infection? Those are the top two reason my daughter won't sleep through the night. She did go through a period of time where I was giving her a pacifier 5-6 times a night.

And you can try just letting him fuss for awhile. He may go back to sleep. Don't feed him anymore if you don't think he is really hungry b/c he is going to get used to that bottle every time he wakes up and he will drive you insane! Just talk to him softly while he is still in bed and see if that helps him back to sleep. Good Luck!|`|yIdgG8b1aa	Id say it could be teething. Has he started teething and having problems in the day? try giving teething gel before he goes to bed. Good luck
Gwl9AeJ1aa	Yes it is wrong. who cares that it is his house, its your daughter.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I think so.<br>  I grew up having a few friends whose families were open pot smokers - and I noticed that my friends has lesser values and often smoked themselves. They got in more trouble, had less class, and often had financial problems because of their habit. They would rather have pot than cable. I didn't get it. <br>  I simply don't like the idea of it. I think it shows irresponsibility and a lack for certain rules in parents, and thus the children get the same idea and there's no one there to correct them. <br>  I mean, I don't mind if they smoke pot - to each his own. But when they're open about it, and do so without shame and in view of your daughter - that's just setting a really bad example.|`|1jcBMzVwaa	Yes it's wrong, on so many levels. What he chooses to do in his home is his business, but when your daughter is there it becomes your business as well, as you have to think about her health and what kind of influence it is having on her.<br>  <br>  I would try sitting down and speaking calmly with him about it first. Explain to him that you don't care what he does when your daughter isn't there, but when she is there you would appreciate it if he would at the very least smoke it outside or after she has gone to bed.<br>  <br>  If that fails, tell him your daughter will be unable to stay there until you have spoken to your doctor about the impact the passive smoke may have on her health, and also spoken to the police about the legal ramifications it may have on your daughter if she is there when he gets raided. ;-)<br>  Good luck!|`|yNInHaMPaa	Most defintly. You are soppose to teach your children (even when they are adults) to be strong individuals, but also to abide by rules. He is showing your daughter that smoking weed is ok...showing her not to worry about consequences. Let him do what he wants in his own time, BUT i would defintly make sure she is no longer in his household, and if he complains i would bring it to authorities. That is your baby regardless of her age, if something were to happen (regardless whether it was because of the weed) you would also wonder "what if" i did something different. You are totally valid in your reasoning. :)|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	Does he smoke it in front of her? Is she under 18?  If so, he's "contributing to the delinquency of a minor". If you're LOOKING for a reason to sever that relationship, you could start there. On the other hand, if  you want to preserve their relationship, you might want to just advise your ex that you know about the weed smoking and that you're tempted to cut her off from him, and would he mind refraining while she's there.<br>  <br>  If he ISN'T smoking in front of her, then unless he BRAGGED to you that he smoked while she's there, then you have no proof and no legal leg to stand on.<br>  <br>  I've done my best for the last 10 years to actually ENCOURAGE my children's relationship with their dad. He's not perfect, but neither am I, and they NEED their dad to love them and support them emotionally. I wouldn't put weed smoking in the same category of shooting up heroin or smoking crystal meth, but of course, that's just MY opinion. I've been lucky that my ex is pretty straight laced and I haven't had to make any controversial decisions.|`|BMfQ0KMtaa	Any kind of smoke is bad for your health.  If you mind that he or anybody else smokes other things like cigarettes or lights incense, then yes, your concern is valid.<br>  <br>  If you do not believe that marijuana is any different than those, than the only reason you would get concerned is due to other reasons such as relationship differences between you two.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that marijuana in second-hand smoke form has been found to be much MUCH LESS harmful than cigarettes' second hand smoke. <br>  <br>  In MY opinion, the farthest you should go is to politely ask the father if he would mind smoking outside, even though it is his house, it is also YOUR daughter.  <br>  <br>  If he disagrees, talk to your daughter about it and ask her what she thinks (IF she's old enough to understand and make those decisions for herself.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  ^^<br>  <br>  If it did, please mark this as a "best answer" so that I may get points to ask my own questions!|`|RPoFBenJaa	The fact that it is illegal should tell you right there that its not right and its your business to mind. She is your daughter, not just his. Do not let her go there, and if he fights you he wont win cause no judge will justify that. Imagine the damage it could be doing to your daughter. If an adult wants to do it, alone in the home on their own PRIVATE time so be it, but not with a kid in the house.|`|ADgJpv0faa	my parents smoke pot and cigarettes and my mother is a recovering alcoholic. and i can't stand any of it. i'm 100% straight edge. i turned out just fine despite these facts but thats b.c my grandma raised me most of my child hood not my parents and b.c i spend most of my time out of the house. my best friend who is more of an older brother is also extremely strict with me and that contributes to me being against smoking and drinking etc. we'll be walking in the mall or something and he'll hear some one say something about drugs or alcohol and he'll just stop walking and turn to me with the most horrifying face you will ever see and its terrifying cuz he's like 6' 2" and i'm 5' 6" so he towers over me and says things like "if you ever do drugs i will kill you" with a serious expression or he'll be like "alcohol? that not cool. if i ever catch you drinking you dont even wanna know" he's so protective of me...but i love it. and i'd do anything to not dissapoint him so...and ya you need to keep your daughter out of that house and away from her father he's a bad influence lol. srsly if it  hadnt been for my gma and my "brother" i would have probably ended up in trouble all the time and with bad grades etc. doing drugs and drinking etc. get her out!|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	yeah its wrong. my mother and father used to do that when i was a child and probably still does...my sister, who was a teenager at the time told the police and they came and searched the house...they ended up taking my sisters and putting them in foster care (i was of age) so they didnt take me...bottom line: it's never okay to do something illegal|`|6jXPL9eWaa	Yes very wrong. I have some friends that went through what your daughter is going through. Now they are growing up on drugs, and smoking weed and having all sorts of bad habit addictions.<br>  <br>  <br>  Explain to her, that it is for her own good.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	Report him. It's illegal.|`|Yqvm8EYkaa	my ex does this. my daughter has shed enough tears so i put my foot down and told him  that he could not see her unless he stopped. he hasn't seen her in 4 years.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	She is ur daughter & u should be concerned & be stoppin her from goin unless he stops|`|0HICV1Tmaa	Um YEA I would be concerned.She will get the idea that it's okay!|`|GBpLZ2REaa	Yes it's wrong. Not just morally, but legally as well.|`|T4BUDLUbaa	yea u can get sick|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Well, this is a tough one for me.  My parents smoked weed my entire life, and I came out just fine.  And, no, I do not smoke weed myself.  Although there are a lot of things I don't agree with about it, I do know that while my parents were high, I never saw them do anything to endanger themselves or anyone else.  They mostly just munched out, and watched tv or laughed with their friends.  Honestly, although I DO NOT like weed, I would be more worried about my child being with a parent who was a drinker than I would about weed, with the exception of one thing.  Weed can get a person in a lot of trouble, and could cause the child to be removed from the home.  So while I agree that she probably shouldn't be going over there, I also must be honest and admit that I think there are a lot worse things her dad could be doing.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	You are right.  No parent that does any drug in front of their kid should have a right to have their kid with them alone again.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It is illegal not wrong.  How does she view it?  Yes it does make a difference that she is an teenager. She is the one that should decide to go over there or not.  I don't think your child's father just started smoking pot today, so why is it bothering you now?|`|cu02Y4cPaa	Please tell me that you honestly know that this is wrong and just want to assure yourself that you are doing the right thing by not letting your daughter go over to her fathers anymore.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	It may be wrong but terminating visitation is also.  What's wrong that you can't talk with him about it?|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yes... it's just a poor choice and illegal|`|dPgP28Aiaa	He shouldn't be smoking weed around her. He either needs to go outside or something, wait till she's doing something else or sleeping, or just not smoke weed while she's visiting him. Tell him how you feel about this, you deserve to have your opinion known.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I think if someone smokes weed it's kinda their business BUT they should never ever do it in front of a child or even in the same house as a child.<br>  <br>  It's irresponsible and just plain retarded.|`|FEhmNTL2aa	Yes, that's a problem.  It will send mixed signals to your daughter and you might find her doing drugs one day.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	no ..i dont provided they dont do it while they should be attending to their children .|`|xFJ2zjIVaa	well i you shouldnt do drugs infront of a child<br>  but<br>  at least its just weed|`|5r7RAgXuaa	Ofcourse its WRONG!|`|axwdwiSuaa	yes, she has to breath that stuff in, but if she's not complaining then she  might do it too.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	It's irresponsible and it is your business because even though it's his house she's your daughter too. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't come down on him like a ton of bricks, though. Just talk with him about your concerns. Nobody responds as well to being yelled at as they do to a civil conversation. Accept the idea that your daughter may want to try it, too. Talk to her about this and see what she thinks. I'm 17 and I actually wouldn't mind it at all if my parents had weed every once and a while, as long as they were pulled-together, mature and otherwise responsible. If they just sat on the couch and got stoned, yeah, I'd have an issue, otherwise, no. I wouldn't be really annoyed if I was told I couldn't try it if I was under 16 because it's horrible for young lungs and brain development. <br>  <br>  People will thumbs down me for this, but pot in moderation isn't that horrible for older teens and adults. It's now being prescribed for a number of health causes, everything from depression to cancer. There's a difference between one joint every once and a while and being stoned all night every night. Also, she should know the consequences of pot and to never carry any on her person or in her car.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  If she hates smoking and doesn't like going over there, then YES you should talk to him. That's totally rude and incosiderate of him to do that if he knows how she feels, and he doesn't then you absolutely must tell him on her behalf. Once again, just try to be calm and talk with him and explain that it makes both of you uncomfortable. There is absolutely no reason why an adult can't abstain from smoking pot when his daughter is in his house if she is bothered by it.
Ot8lxaMEaa	Your pediatrician hasn't talked to you about this? Oh boy. For starters, you child should be on whole full fat milk until 2 years of age. They need the extra fat for brain development! Reduced fat milk won't have enough for her, even 2 %. Research this if you like.<br>  I have no idea why your mother in law would say tht she shouldnt be getting milk...haven't you seen small children, teenagers and adults all drinking it? Thats because it is a good source of calcium and vitamin D. It is very difficult for you to get all of your childs calcium needs if she doesnt drink milk. Most pediatricians recommend up to 24 ounces a day. You don't want to give her much more than the 24 ounces or she might not eat enough solids. She shouldnt really need baby food any mroe either, she can eat healthy, easy to chew regular people food at this age.<br>  <br>  I think you need to buy a book about toddler (What to Expect in the Toddler Years is a good one) and read about the nutrition your child needs.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I drank milk every day until I was 14.  Juice can't replace milk.  Try milk in a cup.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	At around age one, they should be receiving milk, so I'd say your old school MIL is not correct. What else are you going to give her? Juice is not that healthy an alternative and has a lot of sugar. <br>  <br>  As far as the bottle, you can try transitioning her to a sippy that might have a similar nipple to the bottle. Then see what happens. But do not stop giving her milk - she needs the fat from milk (whole milk usually until age 2) and there's nothing wrong with her getting it at this age. Just ignore your MIL.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	SHe needs to be off the bottle but she still needs milk. Milk is a child's number one source of Vitamin D. Vitamin D is important to prevent rickets and other soft bone disease.|`|ibOD8ggDaa	take her off the bottle its better for her teeth milk is ok still|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Does she drink water during the day?<br>  <br>  She really should be on whole milk and not 2%.She needs the fat.<br>  <br>  She does need milk for the calcium (unless you give her a supplement but still, the source is healthier)<br>  <br>  Why will she not drink it out of a cup? have you tried something like pediasure or stage 2 formula?<br>  <br>  I give my son pediasmart <a href="http://www.naturesone.com/pediasmart.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturesone.com/pediasmart.php</a><br>  <br>  and he gobbles that stuff up.<br>  <br>  Perhaps try adding a bit of chocolate or strawberry powder in it (not even the full recommended amount since she is not used to it she doesn't need a bunch of sugar)|`|sAhAEC2qaa	stop giving her baby food she is old enough for adult food cut up or mashed. unless for some random reason she has 2 or less teeth and would be unable to chew the food. offer milk in a cup. if she does not want it then try it in oatmeal, soups, cereal, ect. also give her cheese yogurt and other forms of dairy. You can also get her vitamins in all different forms. vitamin drops, vitamin chewables tablet, and even vitamin gummy bears. just start offering her milk in a cup. if she really wants it then she will drink it out of a cup. you can also try sunny d fortified w/ calcium or calcium added orange juice. there is plenty of ways to get around not consuming milk. i hated plain white milk and still do and i'm fine and healthy. if you really want her to drink milk though, and she will not do so by anything other then a bottle, try giving her pediasure. parents choice makes a cheap kind that is just as good. Good luck!|`|WdRLgvw6aa	I've never heard of a 14 month old baby being weaned from cow's milk.  Most pediatricians don't recommend giving a child milk until they are a year old and then it's perfectly normal to continue drinking it into adulthood.  The only reason to discontinue giving her milk is if she develops lactose intolerance.  Otherwise, milk is a valuable form of calcium and protein that would be very hard to conveniently substitute.|`|j7fzuDxgaa	once baby's are over a year old they should be on cows milk about a pint a day.if she is still on formula the is msa progress for baby's from 6 months to 2 years, but its about 7.00 a tin. should have a tiny bit of juice because of her teeth. she is still a baby i would say its ok to still have a bottle she will grow out of it she wont want to take abottle to school lol. and she does use the cup that's great.|`|wwPx6Wm6aa	i have 3 little girls ages 1, 2, and 3. my kids drink milk to this day. not from a bottle but a sippy cup. the doctor told me not to take it away bc when they are hungry, they will eat. so dont worry. u do what u think is best for her. did the doctor put her on 2% bc i was told to give my kids whole milk untill they turned two.|`|TIqFAXo1aa	3 servings of milk a day is ok- however- it is time to get rid of the bottle.

Drnpe4T5aa	Whenever I would stress over how much my kids were or were not eating, my ped would ask me these questions:<br>  Is the child pooping and peeing regularly?<br>  Does he seems happy?<br>  If the answer is yes, then all is fine.  ;)  <br>  Just like your's and mine, your little guy's appetite is going to go up and down.  As long as he seems like he's comfortable and is filling his diapers, he's fine.  Don't pay too much attention to numbers.  Those numbers are just an average.  To get that average, it takes babies that eat huge amounts and babies that eat hardly anything.  Your guy falls somewhere in the middle.|`|chiFCUC5aa	i constantly stressed over how much my baby ate i even took him to the doctors frequetnly because i was afraid he wasnt gaining weight. My son drank about that much and then at 4 months starting eating like 36 oz in a day.

I think as long as he is gaining weight and having plenty of wet/dirty diapers he should be fine. You should talk to your sons dr to put your mind at ease
AA10556677	It's not unhealthy. Just gross. Tell that she's a big girl, or something to that effect, and that big girls don't eat their boogers. Babies do.

Just make sure they have a humidifer running to put some moisture back into the air. My son was premature as well.

F6lZHRkVaa	I might hire you to babysit if you lived on my block and I know your parents were close in case of emergencies.<br>  <br>  Work up your courage to go to the neighbors. Feel free to leave fliers in your neighbor's mailboxes. I would be impressed to find a flier for babysitting services in my mailbox.<br>  <br>  You can try different daycares to see if you can volunteer. It wouldn't hurt you to call. At some point you'll need to get over your shyness and step out into the world and see what you can do. Being shy is okay, but don't let it deter you from fulfilling your dreams. If you're serious about this, you won't have a problem stepping out there.<br>  <br>  If you really want to work with kids, go ahead and see about volunteering. But if you need to make some money, start applying at fast food restaurants and other places. You have the rest of your life to work with kids, but making money requires job hunting in places you might not be the happiest with right now. Good luck!|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	i would hire you. your best bet is neighbors. dont put up fliers it's best from word of mouth.
7gPAfLrjaa	You are to young yet; & even with all of your knowledge & school for babysitting; I think your responsible enough to go babysit in someones home.<br>  <br>  What you do in case of a medical emergency?<br>  or a House emergency?  Or some problems going wrong in the house while the family is away for a few hours.<br>  <br>  This is something to think about. OK?  I would wait at least until your 16 or 17 years old. I'm Sorry!<br>  Maybe you could continue working as a mothers helper until your 16 or 17. Especially if the mother has a lot of kids & a new baby in the house.  She would probably love you there.  I sure would under those circumstances.<br>  <br>  Daycares might let you help out for a few hours a day! You might want to call them and see!<br>  <br>  Just think of it this way; There is always a shining star at the other end of the rainbow!<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE THOUGH.<br>  ANGEL|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	1. Honestly, a personality has a big thing to do with it for me. If you had the right personality (caring, friendly, creative), I'd consider it.<br>  <br>  2. A good idea would be to go to neighbors offering first babysitting job under 4 hours free. Maybe put flyers in neighbors mailboxes. <br>  <br>  3. Until then, maybe put flyers in their mailboxes. Don't keep bringing it up, but do it in subtle ways. Maybe have your dad invite them out to dinner to get you that first job. If you wow the kids, they will be begging to have you back. <br>  <br>  4. No, daycares are very strict. Once you turn 16 though, you can start doing summer camps and such.|`|cf42ad33feef58c69f4ccb580fc3c0c0aa	1) Yes, you seem qualified and responsible<br>  <br>  2) Usually once you get 2 or 3 families business comes word of mouth.  Can you ask the 1 other babysitting job you have if they know of anyone that might need a sitter?  What about people from church?  Since your parents live 45 minutes from work perhaps some of their co-workers do too.  At my work we have an online board where people can advertise babysitting jobs and where they are.  Do your parents have something like that at their jobs?  <br>  <br>  3) You could offer to babysit for free 1 night.  Or depending on the age of the kids offer to take the kids off their hands for a few hours and take them to a new animated movie or a nearby park.  This allows you to make offers instead of waiting on them.<br>  <br>  4)  Usually daycares require you to be 16 however it doesn't hurt to ask.  Just walk in and ask to talk to someone about it.  <br>  <br>  I hear you on flyers.  When I was your age I put an ad in the paper and it proved to be a bad idea.  I ended up babysitting in some sketchy places and the parents would come home drunk and need to drive me home.  Better to stick with people you know or are associated with people you know.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Not to mention most colleges have a nice daycare center at a very cheap cost to help out with your son. <br>  <br>  Just don't give up on a really good career. If you do, you'll wish you hadn't later on. <br>  Really, it'll be a few years of hard times, but after all that, things will be much much easier - and finding a job will be a cinch.|`|5q7uPqVmaa	You can do it!  I did something similiar but when I was 30;  single mom, graduate school in education, no help from her dad who left when I was pregnant.  But I had help from my family and especially my mom and some friends.  Look at it this way, will nursing be a better career for you and your son than your current job?  At the very least, will you be happier and better able to be his mom?  It's not as if you can turn back the clock and do nursing school at 18 or 22.  Your choice is either now or 35 or 45 or 55.  Better now!  Good luck!|`|PrxlHUT5aa	I was working full time while I was taking my masterals and had a toddler.

You can do it.  It will be  hard, I won't lie, but in the end it's so worth it, for both you and your child.  having a supportive family is a BIG help!  there will be times that you feel like you just can't do it anymore, but you keep your head up, because yes you can.  I would recommend in the future though, that you take your really hard classes like micro in the summer if you can, and let that be the only class you take at that time.  thats a hard class, and it will be hard to keep up with all your other classes too, especially if thats a class that doesn't come easily to you.  Just remember your goals, and don't get too bogged down.  Good luck to you.  I know you can do it!|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Heck no honey! My mother went to nursing school when I was very little, just a few months old. She remembers reading her nursing books to me when I was in her lap staring up at her as a baby. When she graduated a few years later there is a picture of me holding her hand and my baby sister in her arms lol. <br>  <br>  My mother was a semi-single mom at that point. Her and my father got married after my sister and divorced shortly after. You can do it!!! I promise you this! Fast forward 24 years later my mother owns her own house, put my sister and I through private college, and is preparing to put my brother through college this coming fall. <br>  <br>  Its gonna be hard, and sometimes you will feel like the weight is going to crush you, it will not. The wonderful life you give your baby and yourself will be well worth the sacrifice when you 2 are living a beautiful life (nurses make great money)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :-)

AOvtRBU9aa	Chinese so she can communicate better with my parents|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Dutch.

It will just greatly benefit him for his future.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Our kids are bilingual (English and German) because my husband and I are bilingual, too. <br>  <br>  We did the one-parent-one-language (OPOL) system where one parent speaks only one language, and the other responds in only the other.

It is the most spoken language in the world. If I knew that my kids would have life situations outside the US then I would definitely want them to learn this. <br>  <br>  Right now though, Spanish would be the most helpful language for anyone to learn. Of course there are so many variations of Spanish depending on where the person is from, it would be hard to know and understand all global versions.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Well, i'm planning on raising my kids knowing English & French. <br>  But when they're in school, I think i'd like them to learn Spanish. It's so usful to have. I just hope they learn the prettier versions. <br>  The Spanish in Spain sounds so lovely compared to what you usually hear in the US. I hope the learn it that way.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I would want my Daughter to learn Spanish. <br>  <br>  I think it would help her for when she is older, and especially for jobs.

Good luck in 9 days!!!|`|K9kN68fwaa	That's very normal. they say that we have a harder time going to sleep in our third trimester to help us prepare for the many restless nights for when the newborn arrives.<br>  <br>  Try cutting out your caffine intake during the day, coffee, teas, sodas, etc.<br>  <br>  Try not to eat a large meal right before trying to go to bed.<br>  <br>  Try slepping with a pillow in between your legs to take the pressure of the tummy or a pregnancy pillow.<br>  <br>  Try listening to soft music before going to bed, meditation and lavender scents help as well.<br>  <br>  Try to get as much rest as possible before the baby comes.

If you want to sleep in your bed i wouls sleep back to back with my husband and his body was a great support for my back good luck!|`|vVWycFZQaa	Tylenol PM is ok to take.

txSiQc7Waa	Well all that you have mentioned could be a sign of pregnancy or it also could just be ole af. I supposed our bodies can be pretty unpredictable but usually if you've gotten to know yourself well enough to know what you usually do before your period, and now that is completely different...it's a good chance that the new = pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to wait long enough that you are definitely sure that you've missed your period, then test. :) I wish you lots of luck and tons of baby dust!|`|3hP8YByVaa	I really think you might be pregnant! I had those symptoms like  a week after I conceived and still I thought I will have my period but I didn't :) You might start feeling so tired and sleepy as well.. I would say since you're a week late just give it one more week before testing it. I got negative results when I tested within the first 10 days and I was worried something was wrong, so I had to go test it in the hospital and it was positive :) Good Luck.

If she is pregnant she needs to tell her parents!!!  This is VERY important or her health and the fetus!  She needs to visit a OB/GYN to get her first sonogram to see how far along she is or if it is a tubal pregnancy! It's V-E-R-Y important! If she is pregnant and she doesn't go to the doctor and it turns out to be a tubal pregnancy she will miscarry or she could possibly die.|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	your local health department gives free test no matter the age and also provide free birth control.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	If you had unprotected sex chances are she prob is, get her to go to her doc and hel test her instead|`|uqjEXAOmaa	let's hope not|`|apSTH4TIaa	local county health department will see her if she makes an appointment.   she should know the first day of her last period when she goes and they will test her.  They can also offer her free birth control if she tests negative for pregnancy, or they can offer assistance to her about her options if she is pregnant.  You can also get condoms for free through these programs.  You both should take advantage.  If you can't find the number call your local fire department and they usually can forward you to who you need.  Also the county health department will assist you without involving your parents.  Be responsible for your bodies.  Good luck.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	you should definitely test and know that they're not 100 percent so even if it says no she could be. then you need to stop having sex until you're ready to be a parent because every time you have sex you're taking that risk. if you cant afford a pregnancy test how are you going to afford to support a child. these days it take hundreds of thousands of dollars to support a child until they're out of college. if you think you're grown enough to be having sex which obviously you aren't you had better be ready to take the responsibility that comes with it.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	There is a chance that you might be a daddy. If she isn't pregnant and gets her period do extra chores around the house so your parents can give you an allowance to buy condoms.

And pregnancy tests are not that expensive. thats what some people think. <br>  Best of luck. and heads up, you'll get some stupid people that will tell you how much of an idiot you are for doing it in the first place, but don't listen to them. just be safe.|`|P9t2ykodaa	ask your mom for money to go to the mall but use it to buy a test. you need to know. if she is pregnent you need to tell her mom and your mom or if you keep it a secret you could get in more trouble.|`|ZMWszpaWaa	if you dont have money for a test..there is no way you can afford a child...quit having sex be responsible and wait....|`|A48776YVaa	if you did it for 3 weeks then you are a father my ugly man.
hiqdlJMXaa	ok wow sweetie... implantation bleeding (spotting) occurs when an egg and sperm have united and implants in ur uterus. That wouldnt have happened that soon. Takes at least 7 to 10 days. The answer to ur question is TAKE A HOME PREG TEST. I would recommend the first response brand because it can give u an accurate result BEFORE u even miss a period. Go to the store right now and get a test!|`|kgE96Nhcaa	you can't ovulate and then get your period the next day.  Feel free to waste money on a test but chances are pretty slim you are pregnant the dates just don't work.  The bigger possibility are that your hormones are slightly different on the birth control and this may change what your period is like ie, number of days and how heavy your flow is.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	call the doctor... and keep taking the pills until you are told to stop. Have you been on the pill for a min of 3 months?|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	give it about 2 weeks and take a test. testing too early with give a negative. or get a blood test done. i could be your body just getting use to the pill.|`|dJx5eKx3aa	People will be jerks to you on here, so you know. <br>  However, i know how you feel because im 16 and having a baby next weekend. the best thing for you to do is, take a test. although it might be too early to tell, so wait a week. if i comes up negative, take another one the following  week to be sure. and always always use protection, even on birth control you can get pregnant. and thats when you don't miss pills. and if you do miss a pill, you shouldn't have sex for at least a week to let the birth control build up in your system again.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	the only way for the pill to work is for you to take it every day within the same hour, as soon as you don't you can get pregnant and actually have a higher risk than someone that isn't on the pill at all because of the hormones. it could have been your period and its lighter because of the pill or you could be bleeding because you're pregnant. take a test and see but know you can get a false negative but not a false positive.|`|w1drJWKAaa	If the only time you had unprotected sex was the day BEFORE your period, then chances are you might not be pregnant. Missing your birth control pills can sometimes cause a change in your cycle, just like stress, improper diet and a thousand other things.<br>  <br>  That being said however... There are cases where some women can get pregnant while they are on their period, or in the time right before. It depends on your cycle. <br>  <br>  Count back 14 days from the time you started "bleeding", that would be when you started ovulating.|`|BnpEoMD4aa	LYKE OMG TAKE A TEST.|`|8HppGHyVaa	just take a test....but the better possibility is your not pregnant... :-)|`|oehA2KMWaa	ur not trust me|`|BzCYQlcuaa	period symptoms and pregnancy symptoms are very similar. so i would just go see your doctor for a test or just wait another 2 weeks and take a home test. i would not freak yet, spotting happens on birth control also, stress and pregnancy all cause spotting. i would just take a test to easy your mind, good luck.|`|2s4jLzLaaa	YOUR PROPLY JUST WORRYING ABOUT NOTHING WAIT AMOUNTH THEN GET TEST

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You probably don't have anything to worry about. Implantation usually takes place about five days or so after fertilization and missing a pill is probably the reason you are experiencing break through bleeding. You wouldn't be experiencing symptoms of pregnancy only four days later, as well. It's probably stress. Birth control pills will not harm a developing baby and will not terminate a pregnancy so you face more risk of becoming pregnant not taking them than a fetus faces being damaged by taking them.
xv7YlV29aa	um wow no offence but your sister in law is being a ***** and I'm not trying to be rude. I understand she lost her husbend but it is your BROTHER and if you want to name your baby son after him then that is a honor. He'd be honored for that..even if it was only a middle name. <br>  <br>  Its not like your nephew called his father James or Jamie. Most kids...especially that young call there parents by mommy or daddy.<br>  <br>  and besides i'm sure he knows that his father is dead and all you'd have to say is I loved your father, my brother so much that I wanted to name my baby boy after your father. <br>  <br>  I don't really see how he'd be confused. He'd probably be more confused that his father is in heaven and not around, then his baby cousin having the same name. Thats kinda silly.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to her, she is being unreasonable. Its your brother and if I was in your shoes I'd want to do something like that also.<br>  <br>  even if it was confusing it'd only be confusing the first few months. He is 3.....once he gets older he won't be confused.....but then it'd be too late to change the name to Jamie. Do what your heart tells you to. I'm sure your brother would love it...really.<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry for your loss hun. My aunt died of cancer a few weeks ago so I understand.|`|SxPhldhhaa	I'm sorry to hear about your brother. I'm sure he was a great man.<br>  <br>  I don't think that it would be too confusing for the little boy at all. Kids are not total idiots - I'm sure he understands that there are people who have the same name. I wouldn't let your sister-in-law's fit keep you from honoring your brother. She will get over it, and I think James Ross is a great name. Besides, there are plenty of different nicknames that you could use, and if need be your son could go by Jim, or Jay, or something else.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	Personally, I would choose one name or the other and tie that into your son's name. It's wonderful that you want to honor your brother, but naming him the exact same thing may be confusing. You could try using Ross as a middle name with a different first name, James as a first name with a different middle name (maybe something with R or A so that you are still honoring your brother), or you could switch it up and use Ross as a first name with a J name as the middle name. Good luck!|`|tOxxcfKuaa	Your brother must have meant alot to you.If you wish to name your child after your brother, you should do so, regardless of what anyone else thinks...He is your brother and that is your child and she should be more understanding and if she's not, then oh well to bad..Hey she'll get over it...And no I don't think it would be to confusing..Our name is our virtue..I hope you name the baby after your brother.Good luck  ; )|`|f4AJHCHKaa	I think that she is still grieving and that maybe it's a little painful for her. I think that your brother would be honored by you naming the little one after him. Her not talking to you is a little immature, maybe you should sit down and discuss this with her and see if you can maybe come to some sort of agreement? <br>  <br>  Good luck, and sorry about the loss of your brother.|`|kNLi16C6aa	Go for it.<br>  <br>  No one is going to get confused. I think its a lovely tribute to your brother. And besides the middle name is different. So it's not exactly identical.<br>  <br>  In my family, my husbands side, there is an uncle Nick, a Nephew Nick...and a grandad Nick. Everybody knows who we are talking about...if someone is confused, we go by Little Nick, or brother nick...it's fun!<br>  <br>  Don't worry about your sis in law...she's not thinking straight. Of course the 3 year old will know the difference, it's not like he was calling his Dad "james"<br>  <br>  Good luck, and best wishes.|`|IEZoHcysaa	I don't think it would be confusing at all-<br>  <br>  I think maybe your sister-in-law is going through an anger period, it hasn't been all that long.<br>  <br>  I think its an honor to your brother and his wife.<br>  <br>    If you want to compromise how about Ross Alan or Ross James or Alan Ross.<br>  <br>  My deepest sympathy for the loss of your brother|`|GWveqx61aa	i guess im selfish, i wouldnt have even though about someone being confused, but if my sister were to die id put her name as a middle name just her first name though, and thats not confusing, congrats on the new life and sorry on the one that you loved and lost|`|7YWsEbWfaa	not at all. I think that is compleatly appropriate you can name your kid. Whatever you want and it's not like the name is identical|`|0iYoPLGIaa	you could give him a different first name and give him the middle name James. That way the wife will not be upset (maybe it hurts her?). And that way it will still carry on the name but not get confusing...|`|QsbYcxjiaa	no it wouldnt and shes barely related to you im srry to say this but shes prob going to get remarried so who cares and im sorry about ur loss|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	If it bothers her that much I wouldn't do it.  Maybe use James, Alan or Ross as a middle name.|`|Weo3nyy5aa	go for it  name you son after you brother it's your child not your sister in law's child|`|rhh3JmVMaa	Your choice|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Its your brother!! do what u want the little boy wont be confused just explain they have the same name!|`|4SZDuX1iaa	no..u do what  u feel is right.|`|1a8f556a514b8f836795e2adfdcd3848aa	My condolences to you and your family. I think you should honor his wife's feelings. That's your brother but that is her husband and their son is named after him. You could just use maybe his middle name. Honor your brother by telling your son about him, little stories, show him pictures, etc.|`|m016Ddgoaa	It's your brother and your baby so you should be able to name him whatever you want. His wife can't tell what you can or cannot name your baby boy. If I have a boy I'm planning on naming him after my decessed uncle or grandfather.|`|HDQ3Lilaaa	I think she should be honored you would do that for him.... I think he would be flattered.... So what! let them have the same name... that is something he will be honored to have as a name one day....|`|5LAqZUyVaa	why don't u mix the name around so there son isnt confused|`|AA11138222	I agree that your nephew called your brother "dad or daddy" and not by his name so I don't think it's a big deal. I think it's great that you want to honor your brother, and I think your sister-in-law should relax a bit. I'm sure your nephew will think what you are doing is great when he is old enough to understand, and by naming your son after your brother I think you will be letting your son know, from day one, that your family is important to you.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	it won't be confusing for the child! this is more the mother kicking up a sink about "owning" a name.<br>  One of my mothers close friends had a child with the same name as me, and after the first day together we had sorted out who was who, we call each other "Me" because our names are the same, even though we have completely different personalities it gives us a special bond.|`|4cprznZcaa	i think its a wonderful thing to do. its not like you are giving him the exact same name, and your sister in law sounds like she is being a little ridiculous. im sure that your nephew called his father dad, not jamie or james and will understand why you chose to do this when he gets older. i think that you should do what you feel is right|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	You sister in law is somewhat correct.  Your brother already has a namesake, his son, who is Jr.  Go ahead and give your son his name as a middle name, but respect your brother's memory by letting his child bear his name as a first name exclusively.|`|23678244be469e9922f504842deb9ed8aa	if you want to name your son james ross, then do it. im sure that your nephew is a smart kid and will understand that some people have the same name.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I don't see the problem.<br>  <br>  I think it's a very sweet thing you doing.<br>  <br>  I mean James isn't an uncommon name and I'm sure his son knows other ppl named James so I doubt you son's name would confuse him.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I think honoring your brother is a sweet, honorable thing to do.<br>  But, I would reconsider giving your son his first name. <br>  I would pass over the issue of your nephew right now - but think about what an impact that will have on you.<br>  There is no doubt there won't be a day that goes by where you won't think about your brother, but imagine saying his name out loud, hearing it being said, and then finding out that instead of it being your brother  - it's your little boy. <br>  Giving him your brother's name might also lead you to expect him to be like your brother, and it mght be disappointing or awkward if he's the exact opposite.<br>  And then when he's grown up, he might feel like he was just a replacement. <br>  <br>  Maybe giving him your brothers name, first or middle, but call him by another name.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	no, I think that it is a loving idea and a great tribute to your brother. She'll just have to get over it, it was YOUR brother, and you should just name your baby whatever you want. He is too young to understand now anyway he's only 3, did he even know what his dad's first name was? She is being unreasonable.|`|LId3qnI1aa	Surely their little boy would have called him "dad' not "james alan ross".<br>  <br>  I really don't see the problem, if the little boy does get confused, just explain that you named your baby the same as his daddy's name.<br>  <br>  His wife is probably still dealing with grief, and the thought of having everyone saying your brothers names all the time again is probably causing her to become upset.<br>  <br>  I think in time, she will appreciate that you want to honour your brother.<br>  <br>  <br>  =]|`|0UYJkSuZaa	Her son is three, he probably doesn't even know what his dads real name is. He knew/knows your brother as "daddy" not "james". Just do what you feel is the right thing to do in your heart. He was your brother, honor him in anyway you see fit. If she has a problem with it, tell her it's none of her business what you name your son. Congrats on the baby though and sorry for your loss.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	No it won't be confusing.That may not be the whole reason.It may be too painful for her, maybe.I'd go along w/ your plan.He was your brother before her spouse.Besides, growing up one of them will be dubbed JR I can almost assure.I'm sorry,God Bless, and most of all Good Luck!  James Ross is beautiful by the way.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Well maybe you should consider her feelings, maybe you can just give the baby your brothers middle name, as a middle name. Or you can name him Ross as a first name.|`|6iCOMx8laa	no, I think it is a lovely tribute to your brother, however if the son is called James, call your son Jamie or JR.|`|A7cZtZFyaa	No that won't be too confusing!<br>  What name does he go by? Give your son a different nickname than him.
AA10766729	Talk to your pediatrician.  I was feeding my son cereal at 4 months, other solids by 6 months.  Maybe you should just increase the amount of formula?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	talk to her doc; some will let them have cereal at four mos, some say six; probably partially due to where your baby is developmentally...no rush , they get all they need at 3 mos and beyond from bmilk or formula....maybe try giving her an ounce or two more at feedings or feed a little more frequently; it's common for their intake to increase if they are hitting a growth spurt, and they seem to happen all the time! they grow and develop so much and so fast the first year, and seem to keep steaming ahead onto two.....|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If she's still hungry after you feed her a bottle: Feed her another bottle!<br>  <br>  Solids foods don't make babies sleep more.  They get many more calories and nutrients from formula.|`|CpUJI8adaa	put a little baby cereal it babys bottle, three months is fine to start it on cereal. it has it on the box.it start from three to six and then six to nine months .please feed your baby .its ok and make sure you burp baby well after .|`|AA11334468	Gerber 1st foods makes satisfying fruit and vegetable cups. Also try to get a fast flow nipple and include a Tbsp or two of Gerber rice or oatmeal in the formula, it dissolves and gives a more fuller feeling|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	6 months before starting solid food. If she still acts hungry increase the amount of breastmilk or formula|`|cQ7bGZVjaa	You can try baby cereal. I would mix it with formula (or breast milk) until it is pretty runny until your baby girl gets the hang of it then you can slowly start mixing it thicker and thicker over the next few months. If she is having extreme difficulty with it, I would quit altogether and wait a few more weeks. If she breaks out in a rash, vomiting, has diarrhea or shows signs of an allergic reaction, seek medical attention immediately. Do NOT put cereal in a bottle despite what anyone tells you. It can cause baby to choke, compromises the strength of the bottle nipple and is just not a healthy habit to get into. Might as well teach her the right way to eat (with a spoon) from the beginning, it will save her alot of stress later on. Good luck!|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Physically, they need to be able to swallow the baby food without gagging, which will usually happen around four months old.  Other than that it depends on their weight.  It should double before you think about food.<br>  I couldn't wait to feed my daughter baby food and started around 5 months, thinking "oh now things will be easy."  It did not affect how long she slept at night or her general fussiness at all.  <br>  <br>  It gets easier - don't worry!|`|TfzXJcvuaa	I started feeding my baby Rice cereal at three and a half months. Who are these people who make the baby feeding rules? Every baby is different so what makes them think that the same rule applies to every baby? You should do what YOU feel is best for YOUR baby. Rice cereal is recommended for babies with reflux at ages younger than four months so it is not going to cause extra weight gain if you are only feeding it in small amounts and with a spoon.(not in a bottle) Don't listen to other people trying to make you feel bad, Do what you think is best for your baby.Hope this helps|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Adding solids won't make her sleep more. Sorry! Increase the amount of formula she is getting. Make sure is telling you she is full by pushing it away or turning her head before taking it away. Keep offering it until you are sure she is full. Baby food, including cereal, shouldnt be started until 6 months, maybe 5 months for some babies. Their stomachs just aren't meant to digest it until then,|`|MPbB0ri1aa	My daughters' pediatrician suggested I add about a teaspoon of rice cereal in their bottle at night at about that age.<br>  <br>  But that was several years ago and things do change. You can call your daughter's pediatricians and ask. Even after hours most doctors have someone covering for them after hours.|`|HwUfcYsAaa	I used to add rice to my little girls bottles, it would thicken it up and she would sleep longer.  You will have to make the hole in the nipple bigger so your baby can drink it easier.  Talk to ur dr but I am pretty sure you should try rice before food, or maybe even add a little baby food to the rice... fruit maybe.|`|ry0ZQvRUaa	You can put a little cereal in her bottle or try spoon feeding her some VERY runny baby cereal/formula mixture. If she doesnt push it out of her mouth with her tounge she is old enough to eat it! Try it a few times if she pushes it out the first time though.|`|1aJjFrUCaa	You can introduce solids any time between 4 and 6 months if your baby is ready. Until then, breast milk or formula provides all the calories and nourishment your baby needs and can handle. His digestive system simply isn't ready for solids until he nears his half-birthday.|`|AA10441395	My baby was the same way. He was a big baby (90% for height and weight) and was eating almost every 2 hours. Every resource we could find said not to feed solids before 4 months because their digestive systems just aren't ready for anything other than milk. I was breast feeding, so I was limited on supply. If you're formula feeding, then I'd suggest just giving her some more formula. Just hang in there!|`|W8ohh50aaa	All babies are different, but generally rice cereal is introduced around 4 or 5 months. But you should consult your pediatrician prior to introducing anything new. They may suggest putting rice starch into the bottles to help with the hunger. You have to be careful with rice, it can cause constipation, but the best thing to do is call you Dr and see what path they feel you should take. <br>  Good Luck!|`|ZWsIP0NBaa	I do what some of these moms have already suggested.  Fill a 4 oz bottle with formula (or breastmilk) and add 1 tsp of rice cereal to it.  Mix and serve.  I usually give it to my little one as the last bottle before bed so that she sleeps for a longer stretch to give mommy a much needed solid sleep.  I am currently doing this with my 3rd baby who is 11 weeks.  Hope this helps.|`|L1HAQlqqaa	It really depends on the child. They recommend starting your child on baby food at 4 months. You can try adding some baby cereal to your babies bottle to satisfy hunger. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_age-by-age-guide-to-feeding-your-baby_1400680.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_age-by-age-g...</a>|`|JEqaeHmBaa	Continue nursing your baby for at least a year.

CuCrGDuRaa	Well, when is your period due?  It could be the start of your period.  It doesn't sound at all like implantation bleeding.  Take a test, and if it's negative and you continue to bleed when you aren't supposed to be menstruating, call your doctor.  Good luck!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I would at least call the doctor and ask him what he thinks. There could be something wrong. If you are heavily bleeding, I seriously doubt that it is implantation bleeding. It could possibly be a side effect from the pill. I doubt your pregnant, but if you can soon, I would recommend going in to the doctor, perhaps you'll need to get on a differerent kind of birth control. good luck.|`|96HWpdkFaa	The pill can cause you to spot when you start taking it.<br>  <br>  If your worried take a test.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Go to Planned Parenthood tell them you have no money, no job or support system, they will get donations to cover your exam to see what's wrong with you. You can always go to the doctor, check out what kind of services your county offers to low income women/families they are sure to have something but your will need to be financially screened and that can take time so in the mean time call Planned Parenthood (they don't just do abortions, they do all kinds of women's care)

Just let it happen and be happy to be blessed with a healthy baby.|`|txSiQc7Waa	From what I've read, the only way to "almost" choose the gender of your baby has to do with ovulation dates and times that you baby dance before it.<br>  <br>  There are two types of sperm, X and Y. So, one is a boy (Y) and the other a girl (X). Now though they are both sperm, they are very different. Y sperm are very fast but very short lived. So they may run into things and die or get lost or just not make it to your egg in time. On the other hand, X sperm are very durable, but they are also very slow. <br>  <br>  So from what I've read... if you baby dance 3 or so days BEFORE you ovulate, the sperm will already be there waiting and most likely it will be X (girl) sperm. If you baby dance the DAY OF ovulation, the boy Y sperm have a much better chance of getting to the egg before the girls because they are so much faster... <br>  <br>  I hope that made sense... good luck and baby dust to you!|`|8CTNzb6kaa	There old wives tell telling you can predict the gender of your baby , i'm sure you could do it somewhere in this world but i'm assuming it would cost you a lot of money to do so.<br>  <br>  Just remember the Male determines the gender of the baby , I got 3 Girls and another baby on the way , Which i'm assuming is a girl as well .|`|84wJiuWiaa	this is what i have heard, if you are wanting a boy, then it is better to have sex real close to ovulation but if you want a girl have sex a couple of days before ovulation. boy sperm swim faster but girl sperm live longer. hope that makes sence|`|8UthxGKHaa	you cant choose the gender of a child.<br>  <br>  its done by X and Y chromozones.

JXQKzl2xaa	My husband had this problem when our daughter was about 7 months. I realized though, that I wasn't helping matters by going and taking her from him to calm her down, my husband needed to learn to do it. If we as moms keep taking the baby from daddy, the baby won't learn to have daddy calm him. What you should do is leave the room for a few minute and give them time alone. Tell him to distract the baby with noises or a toy or something. After awhile it worked and it still does and she is 10 months old now. Hope this helps.|`|WzoZRmVvaa	maybe, because he hasnt been around his father as much as he was around you, let him spend more time with his dad and he will get used to him|`|KICQQxLxaa	You need to leave the area, and give daddy and son time to bond.|`|BPuyPpNkaa	Your son is probably feeling your husband's uneasiness with handling him which makes your son uncomfortable when his father gets near him.  Have your husband relax and get more comfortable with handling his son and tell him to stop yelling and getting frustrated.  Your son associates his father with yelling and frustration which makes the child, naturally, not want to be put in that situation, so he acts out.
0nIK4qWTaa	I have a 5 year old too. He and his 8 yr old sister play all three. They like all of them. Most Wii games are easy for him though. We got Mario Party 8 first then Mario Galaxy, and just this week got Mario Kart. I like the Mario games because they are all kid safe and even young kids can pick them up quickly.<br>  <br>  My choice is Mario Kart because my son plays it more by himself. My logic being if he really likes it, he will play even if no one wants to join in. With the other two, he has more fun if he is playing with others.  <br>  <br>  My wife's choice is Mario Party 8 and it is my second choice. Our reason is that as a family game, it is fun when we can all join in. There is variety in the game play and even unskilled players like me can enjoy it.<br>  <br>  One more game to consider in the future is Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz. It is a fun for all. It is 4 players. One good thing about it is that the player with the lowest score gets to choose the next event. This lets older and younger kids play together and not fight.   <br>  <br>  For Mario Kart forget the wheel. You don't need it. If you plan to play with your kids or you have other kids over they might fight over who gets the wheel. Do the math. 4 wheels time my  local price of $9.99. $40.00 plus tax. Save the money and/or get Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz. This is up to you though.<br>  <br>  #1 and #2 Mario Kart (You won't go wrong with either.)<br>  #3 Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz (Even grandmother can have fun) <br>  #4 Mario Galaxy (Better for older kids. Age 7 and up)<br>  <br>  You can't go wrong with any of these titles.|`|HTZMJOSXaa	Mario Kart is probably the easiest for a younger child to play.  Everyone can play it and the wii wheels are a fun added extra. <br>  <br>  Mario Galaxy starts off relatively easy, but gets pretty hard.  I would not recommend it for a kid that young. <br>  <br>  Mario Party is pretty fun, but it is more fun when 4 people are playing it.  The one player isn't as fun.  So unless there are at least 2 or 3 people around that would be willing to play this one, I definitely think Mario Kart is the best.|`|sirOvqKGaa	Mario kart is the funnest my 5 year old cousin loves it ! & I like it to I have alot of wii games in the game room of the house like 50 & when kids come over they love mario kart  I also enjoy it & I'm 18;)|`|K8JLYri8aa	you should probably mario party 8 first then m.g.(mario galaxy) then mario kart this is in order by how educational these games are !!!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I have an 8 yr old and we have Mario Galaxy, and Mario Kart but not Mario Party 8.

xue72D76aa	What you are experiencing is 100% normal.  At 22 weeks, the baby is still relatively small and has a lot of room to maneuver.  When I was 22 weeks, I began to feel my first kicks and they were not very regular.  Sometimes I feel what I could identify as a kick but most days were pretty "silent".  As the pregnancy progressed it got to the point that a day never went by without feeling a lot of movement from my daughter.  Before you know it, she'll be kicking hard enough for you to see your stomach move (freaky but totally cool!).  Then you'll be wishing she wouldn't kick *as* much so you can get some sleep.  LOL!|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Every woman is different.  I'm like you.  I'm 21 weeks and I hardly feel my baby.  Sometimes I feel movement but I never feel an actual "kick" and forget about seeing anything by watching my stomach.  As the baby gets bigger (and stronger) the kicks and movements will become stronger as well.  Its all very normal.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	No its normal - your bub is still small.<br>  <br>  You will feel her alot more when you get closer to your third trimester|`|vVWycFZQaa	It's totally normal. I didn't start to feel strong, regular kicks until about 24 weeks. I'm not a big woman either. All women and all pregnancies are different, and what you are going through sounds completely normal. Try not to worry too much!|`|Kx6LmwR2aa	you might want speak to your doctor abt it. they might tell you to keep track of the movement and give you a chart to fill everytime the baby moves|`|RyYWzEZcaa	as long as the doc says the baby is moving well and active I wouldn't worry.  Some babies are just more energetic then others.  =]|`|BKCwQn2Eaa	i am 21 w 6 days and i just started to feel the baby move i really only feel it though when im lying down on my left side or on my back and mostly at night im told its normal and everyone is different so i wouldn't worry to much ... good luck

COiKv8Ofaa	It sounds secret agent name -   The names Tyde, Tyde Anderson!<br>  <br>  I do prefere Tyden Anderson would be nice.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	So I just typed Tyde into babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com. It is a good website that shows how a name can get made fun of. Well, Tyde was not even in their list. Like I said before when I answered your question, Tyde is a type of laundry detergent spelled incorrectly. Levi, Forrest, River and Chevy are actual names. Please, do not do this to your child. They will get made fun of forever!!!! You asked to be honest, and everyone on here is being honest- your child will get made fun of with the name Tyde.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	All I can think of is laundry detergent, but if you love it, go for it. For a truly unbiased opinion you should ask people who've never heard of the detergent.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	Go with Tyler, I have a friend named Tyler Anderson, and it's perfect.<br>  The first thing that the name Tyde will bring to people's mind is the laundry detergent. Although I think it's unique and I didn't think of detergent, others will. Stick with Tyler :)|`|pPlVUIA8aa	Why would you knowingly name your kid like a laundry detergent?<br>  If that is all we can think of, and cannot get past it, what makes you think others will? You are setting your kid up for an awkward life.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I hate it.|`|qxm5mwqjaa	i kinda like it.  its different. it might sound better with a middle name. like alexander, nathaniel,|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Tyde?....Makes me think of Tide laundry detergent..as I am betting it does with most people's initial reaction. I wouldn't use the name for my children.|`|vTra7n5baa	A lot of names ARE things, but does that indicate any kind of sophistication or intelligence if you use them as such?  No.  Stick to the classics:  John, Edward, Jacob, Isaac, etc.<br>  <br>  We have traditions and norms for a reason.  Names are names.  Things are things.|`|IEZoHcysaa	It reminds me of an ocean tide not the detergent. it is your child so it really only matters what you think. If it was my child I would not name him Tyde.|`|qYP3j2Uvaa	I like that name here are some middle names you could use:<br>  <br>  David<br>  Ryan<br>  Austin<br>  Micheal<br>  Mitchell<br>  Caleb<br>  John<br>  <br>  There are a few i really like Ryan, Austin and Micheal. Hope i helped!! Good Luck!!!!!!!!!|`|xbzCxo8yaa	I like it, it's different, however I would add a middle name......like<br>  <br>  Tyde Jamel<br>  Tyde Lamar<br>  Tyde Anthony<br>  Tyde Adam<br>  <br>  just to name a few|`|1o820L3Daa	I like it, I was gonna use the name Tai. I like Tyde, its different. But not too different.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Its cheesy and still sounds like laundry detergent. Why are you asking again lol?|`|zxRkdozwaa	I think its cute :)|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	it's foul.|`|fIh9amylaa	"This is my sone, Tyde, and his little brother, Snuggel."<br>  <br>  Levi (Strauss) was a man before it was a pair of jeans.  <br>  <br>  Just because someone else names their child Tag, doesn't mean that the corruption of a nautical term makes a good child's name.  It might be cool, spelled right, if you are a surfer or fisherman.|`|Ir0dKh3iaa	I actually really like it....I think its very unqiue but I don't consider it weird at all.<br>  If you're iffy about it you can use a name like Tyden and have Tyde as the nickname...but Tyde is fine on it's own as well. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!
RjdrO7DVaa	before I found out I was pregnant, my breasts were very sore.  The nipples got very sensitive and dark.  Increased urination and nausea are also symptoms.  You need to tell the baby's father that you were ovulating around the time that you had sex.  You're gonna need as much support as possible.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Umm yea it happend to a lot of other people, usually unprotected sex leads to pregnancy, go piss on a stick we cant tell you anything!|`|75BjjIEXaa	does being pregnant again really make a difference???

All of them have different interest rates.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well what kind of savings account...they all have different interest rates|`|AA10624857	This question ended up in the Newborn and Baby category so you might want to go back a re-post it in a more suitable category.  I believe there is one about finances.  I am not much on this type of thing, but it seems as though turning $1000 into $112,784 in 18 years is going to take more investment than a simple savings account can offer.  If this is a homework question than you can post it in the homework category.
1VOsRV8Maa	It depends on how old you are, but there are babysitting classes you can take I think starting at age 11 or 12. Then, You have a little "diploma" that says you're certified to babysit. Some mama's are a little more leary of having strangers watch their kids, but if you have something that makes you look serious and professional, I think that would help you get LOTS of babysitting jobs. You could probably google "babysitting classes in (your town)." Good luck! Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  EDIT: While you're in the class, talk to you close neighbors, friends, and family members with children of babysitting age if they're looking for babysitters. Tell them what you're earning money for, and that you're also going to the class!|`|QPMpGjLRaa	go around you neighbor hood or ask some of ur friends that wanna get ride of there sibling fo r one night or put up signs around town|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Start by handing out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children.  If you don't know anyone, you can ask your mom/neighbors/people if they know anyone that needs a sitter.  On the flyer put:<br>  <br>  Name<br>  Number or Email<br>  Rates<br>  Age<br>  Experience<br>  Availability/Flexiblility<br>  <br>  **Please do not advertise over the internet,as it is very dangerous!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
az0m4odmaa	Oh I am sooooo with you on this... I lost a baby at 11wks back in June and I just got another BFN and this was my 3rd month on Clomid. I am so sad. I need a psychic also....lol. I always ask DH when will it be our turn again and he has no clue what to say to me to make me feel better. (not that there really is anything to say). We decided to take off this month from the meds and just try it on our own for a while. Yesterday made 2yrs that we decided to start ttc. Good Luck to you and Lots of BABY DUST for us TTCers!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	instead of looking for a psychic, why don't you ask GOD, GOD can make you whole and fulfill every desire.<br>  I have had 2 children and am trying for my 3rd, I know it will come when God wants it to, don't lose faith!|`|iIVnndPzaa	lol the person above said that your vagina is under developed lol and that youcan't carry an egg... :( hahaha|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	Don't talk to a psychic, talk to an OBGYN or a Reproductive Endocrinologist.
xoM9a7Uyaa	From what I've heard, second pregnancies show much quicker than the first. This is my first, and I didn't stop wearing my normal jeans until about five months in. I have a friend who was still wearing hers at eight months.<br>  <br>  If you're wanting to show off the bump, just wear tight shirts, and as soon as it's there, it'll show!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|FGjanFY1aa	This is my second pregnancy. First was a miscarriage at 8wks6dys & didn't need maternity clothes throughout that time. This time, I started NEEDING them in week 7, but didn't get any until week 11. I wasn't really showing. Just uncomfortably bloated ALL THE TIME.<br>  <br>  Now 20wks pregnant w/ lil mama & have gained 20lbs so far. Mostly in my hips, butt & thighs so NONE of my pre-pregnancy jeans fit. Some of my shirts either bc of the small belly. <br>  <br>  CONGRATS!|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's my second HEALTHY pregnancy as well,and I started showing way earlier,although I still don't wear maternity clothes,I had some too big clothes laying around here. I am 16 weeks,and here's a pic of how far along I look right now. Just to show ya an example. Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc310/deadclownjuggalette21/Picture1560.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc310...</a>|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I started shopping for maternity clothes when I was 14 weeks pregnant.  I'm having twins so my size 2 jeans just wouldn't button at that point and I was sick of wearing sweatpants everyday.  And a little advice when you are shopping for maternity clothes- Old Navy makes very comfortable, stylish maternity jeans that fit well and look like normal jeans.  They are the only jeans I have found that I liked.  Good luck!|`|EAzyjftKaa	Well with all the expenses that are to come why pay $75.00 for a pair of jeans that you will only wear 2-3 months at the most. I went to ross both some very cute outfits and wore them till my due date.  I did not show mich until i was almost 6 months . but i did start to buy clother around 3.5 months along. They said o you will get huge buy them bigger and i did and they never fitted.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i couldn't fit into my jeans after about 12 weeks maybe? so i got a pair of maternity jeans, and i only have one maternity shirt, i cant really wear it yet.. the boob part is too big LOL mine arent growing fast enough i guess, but i have a bunch of cute stretchy shirts!|`|RJ8Jf73Vaa	I was about 4-5 months along! The maternity clothes are so comfortable, I love wearing them! I still wear my normal clothes too, I'm 29 weeks now. Good luck and congrats!|`|4g4K41t1aa	With my first baby i didnt start wearing maternity clothes until i was 5-6 months along. This time around i bought my first pair of motherhood maternity pants at 10 weeks! I wasn't showing a lot or anything, but definitely more than with my first baby. Maternity pants are just SO much more comfortable that i'd buy them even just to relax in. The only downside to the Motherhood Maternity pants is that they stretch out pretty easily and have to be washed more often than regular jeans. Still totally worth it tho!|`|FJFO0GPxaa	I started wearing my maternity clothes early on.<br>  But I am also quite small and I showed a lot. I loved being pregnant and wearing the clothes. But after it is all said and done, my baby girl is so much more important than any item of clothing.<br>  <br>  Congrats!!<br>  I hope your pregnancy goes well!|`|xbzCxo8yaa	I have 3 children and began wearing maternity clothing at different times with each pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  I doubt that's there's one answer to this question, as every pregnancy is different|`|qsAnQa0Raa	I started showing really early for my second pregnancy so I bought a bunch of maternity t shirts from <a href="http://www.lalababyboutique.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.lalababyboutique.com.</a> They took the focus off my eXpanding belly.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I went an bought some at 7 weeks. I wasn't really showing, but I could tell - I was all bloated and didn't fit in my clothes correctly anymore. And maternity pants are so much more comfy!|`|uwFv72ALaa	i start to show when i was 7 months but some women show much fast then other women because of their body size.
24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	The reason you want to avoid homemade ice cream and homemade mayo is because of the raw eggs in it.<br>  <br>  Avoid anything with raw eggs, undercooked or raw meat or soft cheese.  For example: cesar salad, sushi, smoked salmon, anything with feta or bleu cheese, etc.|`|KozoNqpsaa	I guess things have changed alot since I was pregnant last. I ate both homemade icecream and mayo while pregnant and had healthy babies! I'm sure it has something to do with the eggs but I've never heard that before. I don't know why you should avoid banana bread...that seems odd.|`|S4DNQkFraa	I don't think you have to avoid any of those. Just things like fish with high amounts of mercury..things like that...
zp41wG3baa	Audrey Jo- Love this one! Has a nice ring to it!<br>  David Kavanaugh Seidel- The middle names are a doosey to say but i love the name David<br>  Shaun Elizabeth- I have to agree, please don't do this to him! Elizabeth is a little TOO girly and it'll probably embarrass him later in life<br>  Brazton Greene Williams- It's ok but it SOUNDS like the name of a Great great grandfather. Kind of reminds me of a snobby kid, not that the name is the sign of one. <br>  <br>  Martha McCalmon Gleaton- I like the first two names but Gleaton sounds like something that'll give you a heart attack if you eat too much of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, I like the first two and the last one is ok, but I BEG you to change Shaun's middle name from Elizabeth, that's almost cruel. Hope you meant the other way around.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If those names have so much meaning to you then it shouldn't matter what others think. I like Shaun Elizabeth for a girl.|`|pPlVUIA8aa	Audrey is a lovely name, and I love it, so classic.  But Jo, it "scums" it up. If you add a Jo to your kid's name, you might as well marry someone named Jim Bob, pick up and move to the hills of Kentucky.<br>  <br>  David is nice, once again, classic, But Kavanaugh leaves me scratching my head, or rather, smacking it on my desk. <br>  <br>  I hate Shaun for a girl. For some reason, I think that boy's names should be strictly for boys, call me old fashioned, or sane maybe. Elizabeth, once again, classic *Thumbs up*<br>  <br>  Braxton is a dog, not a person. Greene is fab. William(s). Classic.<br>  <br>  Martha, classic, but not timeless, screams old woman. Try a name similar in sound or meaning or use Martha as a middle name. Can't complain about the middle names.|`|yC7jXmK1aa	Audrey is pretty. Really don't like Jo.<br>  Kavanaugh Seidel sounds so pretentious. I don't like it.<br>  Elizabeth for a boy? Seriously? I wouldn't have chose that...<br>  I like Braxton a lot. <br>  Martha McCalmon Gleaton is just all kinds of not my favorite..<br>  <br>  Its sweet that you want to name your kids after people who meant a lot to you, but the names aren't really the best for this modern era.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	Longer names have become more common in society keep up the good work. It beats names like "Bob", "Rod", "Todd", etc. I personally wouldn't choose half of those names for sure if I have kids but hey... <br>  <br>  Braxton is my favorite one, Martha my least favorite.|`|MzUJDQI8aa	o i im not a fan of the name audrey jo.. i like the name audrey but not jo. i think the jo part makes it sound a little trailer park-ish. and btw i thik that your name is a little to revolved around audrey hempburn :)|`|qxm5mwqjaa	audrey jo-- its ok<br>  david kavanaugh seidel--its alot to spell for a small child cant it be shortened?<br>  shaun elizabeth-pls dont do this to him. <br>  braxton greene williams and martha mccalmon gleaton==tooo freakin long. shorten them and they'll sound better|`|1wFnlLo8aa	In my opinion Audrey Jo is a great name. Would Jo be a middle name? I like it better as part of the first name. Two part names are interesting and different.<br>  <br>  Shaun Elizabeth= I hope you meant to say that you love guys names for girls; instead or girls names for guys. That would not be a good thing to do to a boy but for a girl: it sounds very nice.|`|IEZoHcysaa	I like them all except Shaun Elizabeth-I like Alex Elizabeth though<br>  <br>  The rest of the names are great along with the reasons for them|`|FsiG5WtQaa	I like all of them. And since they all have meaning to you, that makes them even better.|`|tWV1aVS9aa	I really like Audrey Jo and David Greene. I also love that your naming you kids after people important in your life!

If your period doesn't come in a week or two take another test and if it still comes out negative go see your doctor.|`|XcMczndWaa	Thick white discharge sounds like a yeast infection. <br>  You should see your doctor immediately as he can give you a proper diagnosis.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	If you don't get one by the end of the week, take another HPT.  Your HCG levels might not be high enough to detect a positive test.  Good Luck to you.|`|MW18liqTaa	What is your question? The test was negative.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Thick white discharge was my very first pregnancy symtom. Take another test in a few days or go to the doctors and request a HCG level blood test. All the best

No sooner than that though.|`|GLJkGgloaa	I conceived the week of Valentines day and about a week later I had sore boobs and cramps.<br>  I just got my BFP today|`|w35XH6Rgaa	Well here is my story. My husband got locked up for 8 months and I just started ahving intercourse again on the first of February. This morning 22 days later I started spotting. I took 3 pregnancy tests and all positive. I have a 10 month old already and am freaking because they are going to be so close together it is going to be hard but so for the answer to your question. I must have conceived sometime after the 1st dont exactly know when but 3 weeks later I found out. I took a PT on the 17th and it was negative but I am not sure for sure if it was because with all three that I recently took it took a while to come through and the second line was very faint. So it can take 2-3 weeks|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Most people dont get symptoms very early around 5 weeks maybe. Thats when my symptoms of sore breasts started and then everythign else like headaches and more discharge and nausea and tiredness all follow on after that, the very odd person will say they experienced symptoms right away but when people think there pregnant they think they have symptoms but they dont really.<br>  <br>  Gud luck|`|KRY2iF4gaa	I started period like symptoms a week to 2 weeks after. Had a crampy, bloated feeling for a couple days, my boobs were always sore & I was tired ALL THE TIME! <br>  About a week or so after that was when all the fun nausea started with the throwing up every 20mins.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	i noticed i had blue veins running thru my chest and thought to myself...havent seen that since last time i was pregnant.......pregnant!!......yes i was....only 2 weeks...morning sickness started at 8 weeks.

I'm 8 weeks and 3 days. But really I've been praying alot and taking my prenatal vitamins, eating veggies, drinking water, and getting alot of rest. <br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your loss that must make things hard. But theres not a very good chance of that happening again. And cramps are normal as long as it is not with bleeding. and headaches are very normal too. You should get the book, "What to expect when your expecting" It will help alot. <br>  All you can do is try and be as healthy as you can to prevent a misscarige. I think your fine! Congrats and try and calm and be happy!|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i know how u feel. all i think about is miscarriage. but your baby doesn't need the stress. the last few weeks i have been allot better since i started yoga. yoga is mind , body and Spirit and it helps and tells you how to deal with stress when you are in a stressful situation. i would really take this up! if you cant afford yoga i would go on line and look up websites to the teach you home yoga.. i have been doing so much better and i feel so much better. im not the "yoga" type but now i am such a believer!! when it comes to your fiance..... i just tell my husband. im sorry can we talk about this later its causing me stress. and when it comes to stressing about miscarriage i just pray, read and keep myself busy and know its in gods hands. also try going to a book store and just hang alone and read! and a starbucks so just a quite place at home. i read books that just give hope!<br>  <br>  you can do this.. you go pregnant again for a reason! remember that please!<br>  <br>  <br>  god bless<br>  email me if you need to talk!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Honestly,in my personal opinion. I think 'stress' gets a bad rap. All women who find out they are pregnant stress,including myself. I am one of the biggest worry warts anyone could ever meet. <br>  I've even read articles,online and in books. That the number one cause of a miscarriage is chromosomal abnormalities. And there's nothing anyone can do to prevent that. You've just got to hope for the best,and let the rest fall where it may.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	if you and your fiance argue too much - why be in this relationship? are you two really compatible?<br>  <br>  you say you stress too much - try yoga its really relaxing and can help you keep the baby.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	I take after my mother, a stress-a-holic!<br>  I've had the worst 4 months, and this last 2 weeks have been the worst.<br>  I had to re-home my dog by January and only just got rid of him last week, Im in the process of moving and before Thursday I didn't know where I was moving to, my partner is a liar etc etc.<br>  I smoke and drank alcohol and did drugs in my first trimester because I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS PREGNANT (now that I know I would never ever do anything to harm my baby!!!!!! So please don't judge because I had no clue!), and then finding out I was pregnant...wow. I was stressed.<br>  But you know what made me relax...<br>  I fixed my problems!<br>  I sold the dog.<br>  I have a place to live.<br>  My partner has been mega helpful since we found out we were pregnant.<br>  And I went for a scan and my baby is perfectly healthy!<br>  So drink some chamomile tea, put your feet up and relax... there is nothing to worry about because in 9months you'll be holding a perfect little bundle wondering why you were stressing so much. You'll be fine, just let the pregnancy take its course, welcome the cramps and morning sickness, it's what we do for a lifetime of love!!!!!!<br>  Have a lie down and clear your mind...everything will be fine.|`|7xit1ogxaa	I'm sorry for your loss. I know it is hard, but you need to relax. Stress is not good for you or your unborn child. The first thing you need to do is stop going on the internet reading about it. That will only drive you crazy. The next thing you need to do is find something to help you relax. Maybe read a book, listen to music, cook, read the bible, or even watch tv. I'm not sure what you two argue about, but if it is always little things you should make a list and write five things on it that you won't fight about anymore. Both of you should stick to this and it may help with the arguing. Take care.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	It's hard not to think about things like this. Are you ready to have a child? If you are I think you need to do things that keep your mind off having a miscarriage. Because now your going to worry if it's going to happen again.  Read, clean, take walks, visit friends family, etc.  There is never a right time to have a baby, it just happens.|`|gZsdlthQaa	Try not to stress I lost two last year one in april another in june... Late june I got preggo again and I am having a very healthy little boy here in about 20 days.... Congrats... Don't get to worked up about it just take your prenatals go to all your doctor visits... I was the same way I went in the hospital with every little cramp i had to make sure my son was fine....|`|EX6mkq8taa	You need to talk to your OB.|`|Guj2d3Xmaa	for starters u could leave your fiance...or at least sort out your problems with him...i kno its not easy but if hes making u that unhappy u might find yourself a lot more happy without him..3-5 times a week is too much arguing in a relationship...i stressed a lot in my first trimester but that was because i was freaking out because im only 17...but the cramps and headaches are usually normal..there were days that i thought i would never be able to get out of bed in my first trimester..but on the bright side...it gets better on your second trimester..just dont think the worst it will only make you stress more.|`|apSTH4TIaa	Of course you are going to stress if you recently miscarried.  That is completely normal.  I was told by my doc that I would be super fertile after my miscarriage and I was.  I carried the baby to term and she is now 5 months.  You cannot stress about every little thing.  I think that you will either carry a pregnancy to term or not.  Our bodies are very resilient.  My third baby I was in training at the company I am now and I was 6 months pregnant, my ex husband had been arrested by the federal governement and I had 2 toddlers at home.  I attended training and federal court and was basically a single mother of 2 toddler boys, until I woke up and got a divorce.  Needless to say it was sooo stressful and my daughter was born a week late.  I think that if your baby is meant to be it will be.  Try to relax and be happy that you have a baby growing inside you.  Everyone has stress and lots argue and go on to delivery beautiful healthy babies.  good luck..
QTSsGbubaa	water down prune juice....|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Dark Karo syrup, will make em poop like no other! A teaspoon of that in a warm bottle, he'll be going within the next few hours! And, if all else fails and he's so terribly uncomfortable, go to wal-mart and get adult suppositories (SP) and put it up his rear, he'll go that very second, it's like lube for his bottom and it won't hurt so bad. Just be prepared with a towel and a few wet wash clothes, cause its gonna be a doozy.

AA11763588	A line is a line. The darker it is the more HcG hormones are in your body.|`|eFB2jLVbaa	it doesn't matter whether the line is so light you can barely see it it still means it's a positive which results in you being pregnant, if you take another one like in about a week it will probably be darker, the reason it's so light is you don't have a lot of the hormone in your urine yet to be detected, if i were you i would call tomorrow for an appointment to see you obgyn<br>  <br>  congrats!!!|`|28WJwHf4aa	No matter how dark the line is, it's a positive if you can see even the slightest line. You may want to retest for reassurance, but chances are you are pregnant! It won't necessarily get darker from week to week either.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Nope i took two tests and one line on each of them was lighter than the other and it stayed that way if theres two lines no matter how light or dark it means ur pregnant :D|`|D35xKICoaa	A positive is a positive the darker the line that mean your HCG  are high good luck*****|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	take a second one to be sure. I dont think that the line will get any darker from week to week|`|TbV5gBqYaa	No, it shouldn't matter. My second line came up lighter for all of my test.. It just means that your hormones aren't fully ready to be picked up on it yet.. It the second line is hardly there, your still pregnant! Hope all goes well and congrats if you are..|`|AA12395149	The darkness of the line doesn't matter, as long as it's there. It may or may not get darker if you retest in a week.|`|BnpEoMD4aa	i did two first responses... and the lines were SUPER faint, but then I took an electronic test, and it read 'pregnant'... so i think some of those tests are just sketchy. try doing an electronic one.|`|FEg0PDdnaa	If the line appears in the time specified in the instructions then it doesn't matter how dark it is.
R36nThwLaa	your dr. estimates your due date from your last menstral period.<br>  so he used jan. 8th. <br>  but you most likely conceived two weeks later around jan. 22nd.<br>  <br>  so it puts your due date two weeks earlier.<br>  the dr. doesnt know your cycle, when you ovulated, or anything like that. all he is knows is what you tell him....since you dont know he asks the first day of ur last menstral cycle. <br>  <br>  Congrats on being preggers.<br>  we've been ttc since sept. 2008<br>  and tomorrow AF is due, cross your fingers and pray shes a no show!!! =)|`|g5JeSJbNaa	use a calender and count back the number of days/ weeks and you will find out good luck and congrads|`|GtwJsTCeaa	<a href="http://www.askdramy.com/ovulationcalc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdramy.com/ovulationcalc.ht...</a>
O0PfwDJeaa	I am 5'5" and weighed 220 pre-pregnancy.  We tried for over 4 1/2 years...including 2+ years of fertility treatments (clomid, femara, injectibles, IUI, etc).  Unfortunately, none of it worked.<br>  <br>  We gave up trying, and started pursuing adoption.  My family doctor asked if I wanted to try metformin, which could help my hormone levels.  The first month I took it, I had a 28 day cycle.  The second month, I ovulated.  Six months later, I got pregnant with no other medical intervention!<br>  <br>  You need to talk to your doctor, if you haven't already!  Are you on metformin?  If not, you need to ask about taking it.  I wasn't on metformin at first because I wasn't insulin-resistant and shouldn't have needed it.  Obviously they were wrong!<br>  <br>  Losing weight will help, but it may not be enough.  There are many tests that can be done to see if there are other problems.  There are also many fertility meds that can be prescribed to help you have a quality ovulation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|56731a9ade7bcca40d3c6063bb258c1faa	I have been on Metformin for years for PCOS, along with the BCP to regulate my periods.

I'm now 16.5 weeks preggo, we're going to find out the baby's gender next week, we're excited. <br>  <br>  Dont worry about the weight, I'm only 5'4" and 280 now. I've only gained four pounds since being preggo. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GtwJsTCeaa	I know what you're going through.......... If your really serious about having a baby and you have pcos- your best bet is to see a dr and get fertility help-People with pcos are not very likely to become pregnant on their own.... (also note that I am approx same height/weight as you)Good Luck|`|ba4500039e8f92604ce593a1896685dbaa	I've been up and down constantly with my weight for the last year.  I've never really taken my weight seriously until a year ago and am a little less than what you weight now.  I've also been on Clomid 50, 100, and 150mg each one time.  I took the metformin for a couple months but not consistantly so I didn't expect it to work, I would get really sick on that, so obviously I was not able to "lose weight" or regulate periods on it.  Even with the exercising and losing weight, I'm not saying this is your case, but some that have PCOS will still need help with getting pregnant.  I read that losing 10% of your weight would help significantly, and I've already crossed that threshold, so I'm pretty much just getting healthy for my own being right now.|`|GzW8ZPinaa	Doctors have often thought that I had too had PCOS because I have been unsuccessful at conceiving.  I have been told on so many occassions that weight loss can be very helpful and that sticking to a diet can also be helpful. I have been trying to lose weight myself for the last 6 weeks.  Sometimes doctors will subscribe Metformin to help PCOS.  You may even want to consider taking a few rounds of Clomid. I actually go back to the Dr. tommorrow to find out what more I can do. I really wish the very best for you. I understand how it feels to try so hard and feel like everyone else around you is having baby's but you. Good Luck!!|`|EZOXJK4haa	Hang in there! My wife has PCOS, and we tried for 3 years to get pregnant. Then, we bumped up her exercise, and ate better. After losing about 10 pounds, she finally became pregnant. 8weeks now! Wish us luck! So, it *is* possible, and losing weight is the BEST thing you can do to improve fertility. Also she weighed about the same as you when she became pregnant. Eating good is important too, with PCOS, you tend to have trouble with insulin. If you contine to have problems, check with a doctor, and make sure thier isn't a bigger problem. Most of all, relax. It can happen.
reGPatA6aa	yeah, unless its like against their religious beliefs.<br>  if you can prevent an unwanted pregnancy, why wouldnt you?|`|LTWlBSFNaa	yes|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes i do. theyre gonna do it reguardless so might as well be protected|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Yes...unless they WANT kids...which i dont think they would....|`|HpWCjBv6aa	No, I don't think introducing hormones to everyone is such a grand idea.  Hormonal birth control is not something to be played around with, it's very serious as you're altering a woman's (or girl's) menstrual cycle from artificial hormones, to run the way you want it to.  Scientists agree that no one woman should be on hormonal birth control for any longer than five years because after that, they don't know about any side effects on fertility.<br>  <br>  Also, there are other forms of birth control we can teach our children about: condoms, for starters.  There are also female condoms, diaphrams, cervical caps, sponges, spermicide, copper IUDs, and to top all of THAT off, the added method of withdrawal.  Now, I'm not saying people should use withdrawal exclusively, I'm saying that pairing withdrawal with, say, condoms, improves the chances of protection.  Instead of 73% or 89%, you now have around a 93-5% chance of not getting pregnant.  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  I don't think we should force children to take artificial hormones, especially if the family in question has a history of fertility issues.  I think there are other ways to handle this, even if the teen is sexually active.|`|sagjCRvKaa	Yes, keep in mind this does not protect against sexual transmitted diseases. Being on birth control doesn't give you a license to go out and have sex, you must be responsible too. You have your whole life ahead of you, please be responsible, kids are great but they will change your life and sometimes you may not be ready for that change.|`|vYgJMybeaa	No. Teenagers shouldn't be sexually active.|`|TYxbaE4paa	Yeah, because it's better to have less a risk of becoming pregnant.|`|GpitqYxcaa	Yes, always use a condom and bc, it's the safest way.<br>  <br>  -Billy|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	It would help decrease teen pregnancy at least a little..<br>  So yeah.|`|3XDr0EiSaa	I think they should wait till marriage.|`|JLBuXqStaa	um yes!|`|w38FLTPNaa	As old and backwards as you may think this sounds, i don't think teenagers should be sexually active and if they are, yes they should be on birth control. Tablets for the not getting pregnant and condoms for the STDs :D<br>  You shouldn't have a party without the balloons :D|`|a448ILgCaa	yes and no. no because you have a much higher risk of getting breast cancer...and yes cuz you dont want a kid|`|Yqk8F2gUaa	Yes.<br>  better safe then sorry.|`|QQE58qFQaa	YES!!!|`|uuaapqOeaa	yes, of course.|`|d5K8wORqaa	yes|`|4tFuosueaa	If you have 1/2 a brain you will.
D35xKICoaa	My sis lazy and love meat she is having a girl she did the ultrasound only hope they are right|`|SsB7aRExaa	None of those things has ANYTHING to do with the sex of the baby.  Those are all just old wive's tales.   <br>  <br>  My wife has had more pregnancies than most women, and she would tell you each one is different.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	I loved fruit and hated meat, and slept all the time... zero energy... my son is 5 months old now.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	My first 2 were simular but not the same. So when i was pregnant the 3rd time and it was totally different i thought for sure i had got my girl. I have 3 teenaged boys. Might be a girl, might not. So don't get your hopes too high.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	i love fruit...am extremely tired and lazy lately...and i am having a boy...<br>  <br>  every baby is different|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	There is a 50% chance you're having a girl!|`|T9G4DykLaa	I have two boys and my third is a girl.  My morning sickness was pretty bad with #1, but was over by about 12 weeks.  With #2, I had hardly any m/s at all, and even wondered if I was still pg a few times.  With #3, my m/s was bad again and lasted for 6 mos.  I can tell you that I craved salty, cheesy things with the boys but sweets with my girl, and for a while all I wanted was ice cold milk, the colder the better.  I was always tired with all three.  Hope that helps and good luck getting your girl (of course healthy is what we want, but I understand).|`|xKT73EqMaa	Every old wive's tales pointed to me having a boy and I am having a girl. I think the majority of pregnant women are tired in first trimester, its a very common symptom and I'm surprised you didn't have it before. Sorry, but you just have to wait. Theres no way to know without an amnio or an ultrasound in a couple of months. Good luck!
bca487ff0cca88db0a164d06e72bb6b5aa	I like Kara the best out of those. If you do go with Alley I would choose that as a nickname for Alexis or Alexandra.|`|m3cf7vsAaa	Alley is cute, and it's a lot cuter than Allison.  I wouldn't worry so much about what you thnk she wants to be called, I'd think more about the story behind why you named her whatever it is you name her, as she will probably take more interest in that aspect of it when she is big enough to understand.|`|hVJlbNZUaa	I like Kara and Allison, personally. Kara, you don't really hear babies named that right now, so that's a good thing! and Allison is a Classic. I love it :)|`|IHZJNZ9waa	Allison is the best. And if you want to give her a nickname off of that, then go for it. but If her name is Alley, you can't nickname her Allison.|`|f2osf2iNaa	I do love Allison. I think you should do it that way just in case. My sister has a friend Ally and it sounds cool when they occasionally call her Allison.<br>  <br>  I have Kara and Leah set aside for myself :p|`|4B0k5i99aa	I love Kara.  Leah is good too.  <br>  <br>  If you need middle names also,  Kara Nicole and Leah Hope are very cute.<br>  <br>  And if you want Alley, I would go with Allison or Allyson.  I prefer Allyson.|`|3y9AlP6Raa	Kara.......Supermans cousin?<br>  Leah........Tight hair buns ...Star Wars?<br>  I think you would be advised to look at your spelling of `Alley` and consider the consequences for your daughter in later life.<br>  <br>  Allison sounds nice.|`|KvpNij1raa	I like the name Allison, and you can always give her the nick-name Alley,  but you can't go the other way.<br>  hope this helps.|`|sIqzhWMLaa	In my opinion, Leah's the best. I'd prefer a longer name with Alley as a nickname, like Aliana (ali) or Alina. (ali)|`|pO0s0bhHaa	I like Alley the best.  And I do prefer Allison though.  If you like Alley for the first name then go with it.  It's not too informal for a first name.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	Alley|`|mh2hT92caa	can i offer a few more suggestions?<br>  <br>  Markeisha<br>  Tameka<br>  Karlita<br>  Karleisha<br>  Moniquita|`|g14dvvy0aa	I might be a little biased (since Aly is my name).   My real name is Alyson, but I've always loved being Aly!|`|KaSuwOOQaa	Leah is the only one I like.|`|Png4I6TNaa	I like Kara best. But yes, Alley may be a little too informal.|`|lPlOvSkTaa	they are cute <br>  yes you should name her allison but call her alley<br>  <br>  do my recent question please|`|uS07WAwcaa	Leah its my name too<br>  I do think its too formal<br>  Allison or Aliana Alexander...|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I love Alley!!  But I would have to say to go with Allison, and use Alley as a nickname.<br>  <br>  Leah would be my 2nd choice,<br>  and Kara 3rd.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	i love Kara<3<br>  i think you should spell Alley like Allie. i don't think it's too informal. but if you want to make it formal don't use Allison, that's ugly no offense!<br>  <br>  what about:<br>  Callie<br>  Alexandra<br>  Alexandria<br>  Alliana (Allie-anna)|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Kara is one of my favorites, but I like it spelled Cara.<br>  Leah is my cousins name, but it's still a nice name. I like it spelled Leigha.<br>  <br>  And about the 'Alley' thing, I'd name her Alyson and call Ally.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I like Alley. I know a little girl named Alley and its not a nickname.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I love Kara, short and sweet, lovely name|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Of those, I like Leah best, but if Kara were spelled Cara, I'd choose that (incidently, I know twins named Leah and Cara). <br>  <br>  Alley is the spelling of a dirty, narrow, back street. And, yes, I think it's too informal. What about Calla, nicknamed Allie?|`|HFA05vDuaa	i like Leah the best and plan to name my daughter that. i don't think alley is to informal. i know alot of alleys and i think its a cute name|`|RLMcpYheaa	Alley is well, you know, like an alley, so no. Maybe Aly?<br>  <br>  Otherwise, my favorite other than that is Kara.|`|d3BZlRyhaa	I like them all <br>  but Alley the best<br>  one of my friends name is Aly so I personally don't think its an informal name. <br>  I don't like the spelling Alley though i prefer<br>  Aly or Ali :)|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	Those are great names. I think Allison, Alicia, or Alyssa would be good as a first name if you decide on Alley - it does sound like a nickname only.|`|UriE3wN6aa	Allison!!!!|`|NNki7qiFaa	Leah.<br>  My cousin's name is Alix, we call her Ali for short. I like Alix better than Allison.|`|CNDdRFR2aa	La Fwandah is da best
MHOxPs8Oaa	You can get college loans without your parents. But, I wouldn't unless I knew that my son/daughter would be paying for it, if that is how they feel.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Yes, I would, because it is my belief that the parents are responsible for putting the child through college, or at least helping as much as they can if they aren't financially able to do it.  having said that, i do have to admit that if it were for a child that i knew was notorius for skipping class, etc and i wouldn't end up with a well educated child out of it, then no i wouldn't....but other than something like that, yes i would.<br>  <br>  Edit - wow, i got thumbs downed because I think that parents should educate their kids?  whoa!  no wonder the world is in the state it's in!  if more people would be responsible for the kids they have, and educate them, all of us would be better off!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	My parents refused to cosign for me.  It's wasn't because I was irresponsible.  It was more that they already have plenty of financial responsibility, are working off of educators' incomes, and could not risk the burden being placed on them if I should be unable to pay (as you mentioned, to complete your education costs more than a new vehicle...that's a lot of responsibility to take on.)<br>  <br>  That being said, I was able to cover all four years at a university off only my federal loans, grants, and scholarships.  My parents paid for my housing, books, all other living expenses, and helped if any school-related costs were not covered by the above.  They also help me pay off my student loans now (even though I graduated almost 4 years ago....and told them that really isn't necessary.  Appreciated of course, but not necessary.)<br>  <br>  So...yes, it is nice if parents will cosign for you, but not all parents can/will.  Perhaps you can sit down with yours and discuss what options ARE available to help you finish getting your degree.  Best of luck.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	so here's the truth, and those of you that think otherwise don't know what you're talking about because I've actually been through all this.<br>  <br>  Students with little to no credit history will NOT be approved for a private student loan. Especially in the current economic climate. Most students are lacking a credit history, since most parents discourage their kids from getting credit cards to build their credit and they haven't had very long to develop their credit anyways. My credit score is 720, but I'm 21 and I wasn't approved for a student loan just last year without a cosigner.<br>  <br>  First, I'll say the way that EFC is calculated is a little ridiculous in that it expects parents to pay way more than what makes sense. But you're right, the federal government thinks that your parents should provide the EFC amount. Otherwise, they wouldn't have such a measurement of family contribution. So, if your parents refuse to provide that amount, they should cosign on a reasonable loan for you to get your education. I don't think that mom and dad should cosign a $20,000 loan for their daughter to go to beauty school. <br>  <br>  PLUS loans are different, because it's your parents taking out a loan in their name; therefore, it's their responsibility to pay it back.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is, many years ago parents were expected to support their kids until they were 18. Now, parents should plan to put their kids through college. It should be considered part of the expenses in raising a child.<br>  <br>  Good luck in finding student loans, it was difficult this year as many banks have gotten rid of their student loans due to the economy. Hopefully the bailout does more than just put this country further into debt!<br>  <br>  OH and a tip: get yourself a credit card and start putting $30 on it a month and paying it off on the due date. Start building your credit with small purchases that you know you can pay off at the end of the month!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hey, I'm a senior at UofM!<br>  yes, if you have another close relative I think you could ask them.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I don't think this is a matter of trust and you should really talk to your parents about what they are thinking at the moment. I think everyone is protecting themselves financially right now and it seems your parents are no different. Imagine if they co-sign for these loans and you are unable to get a job (through no fault of your own-we all know what the job market is right now) to make the payments or your fathers business makes even less in the coming years. Could they lose their home? <br>  <br>  The best gift your parents can give you while starting out in life is a home to come back to if you have trouble making it on your own AND taking care of themselves (retirement etc) so you don't have to in the future. <br>  <br>  I think you need to keep looking for the best alternative, a less expensive school perhaps? You should also check into when you are able to not consider their income for financial aid. I stayed out a year and worked to accomplish this myself. (That was over 20 years ago and I have no idea what the rules are now)<br>  <br>  I promise you that this entire situation is breaking your parents hearts. You must know that they want the best for you, they also have to protect their own future. Keep searching for alternatives. There is always a solution to every problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|wZAeBisbaa	Most college students don't get nearly enough in Stafford loans to pay all their expenses. And I have never yet seen a realistic expected family contribution among those in our family's (middle class) income bracket - the financial aid estimates are all crazy, in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  I have two kids in college.  Although they get scholarships and Stafford loans, they both need private loans to make ends meet.  We have taken out a PLUS loan (once) but discovered that the interest rate is higher than on alternative private loans, if those loans are taken out with a parent cosigner.  In addition, payments on the private loans in our children's names are deferred until they graduate.<br>  <br>  So if the choice is a high interest PLUS loan that we have to begin paying immediately or a lower interest private loan that we would only have to pay if our kids default, it seems like a no-brainer.  We cosign, and if they default, we are still better off than if we'd taken out the PLUS loan.  But we know that won't happen.  They are very responsible, and we trust them.<br>  <br>  You sound a lot like our kids.  If I were your parent, I would sign.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I wouldn't only for the fact that I knew my son.  <br>  You have to realize that this goes on your parents credit history and if you miss a payment then they're responsible for it and maybe they wouldn't be able to make the payment either.  You need to see where your parents stand on their end before downing them.  You'll be a parent someday and face the same ordeal.<br>  You can look at it this way too, once you turn 18 you're legally responsible for yourself and there isn't anything in writing that states your parents have to pay for you to go to college or tech school.<br>  It's a tough deal on your part.  Keep checking around for other types of loans and scholarships.|`|A8ofpjUiaa	I really feel for you being in this situation as I am definitely a parent who would if able pay in full or co-sign a loan for education.<br>  <br>  However there may be a wider issue here, which is your parents overall financial situation. For most people risking the family home, which will probably be the collatoral used, is too great. Not many parents divulge the family's true financial situation to their children.<br>  <br>  You sound like a sensible guy, talk further with your parents about this and their concerns and what possible assistance, if any, they feel comfortable with. I can't imagine any parent not willing to co-sign and help their child's future if they were financially able.|`|dcc00da4a672d60c97d41b26eabd27d0aa	I am so thankful to my father, who has solely helped me through college. I started at age seventeen, but even all the money I saved from my two years of employment were peanuts compared to what I needed to survive on my own. He cosigned my lease for me and made sure all of my loans were squared away. Without him, I would have never been able to go to college. Yeah, it's great that some of you can afford it on your own, that's awesome. But it's tough trying to be an adult at age 17, when most everything you need to do requires you to be 18. <br>  I have never been unemployed since I was 15. I manage my money and can afford to pay all of my bills by myself. I have a decent paycheck each week. But I still need my dad to be around for emergencies. Like when I get a flat tire on the freeway and don't have the funds to get a new tire.<br>  My father firmly believes it's his responsibility to make sure I get through school. He looks down on other parents that kick their kids out at 18 and don't help them whatsoever. <br>  <br>  So yes, If you were my kid, I would help you anyway I could.
7rCeCVl2aa	I have one too. It only detects if there is fluid in the ears. The problem is if there is ear wax in the ear canal you will not get a positive reading. <br>  <br>  I have used mine several times and it missed both times he had ear infection. <br>  <br>  Personally I am not a fan.<br>  I find it hard to hold the baby down and use it properly meaning rotate the ear check as it is beeping and well like I said before it didn't work any way.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Get the doctor to check the ear he knows what to look for, I had one child that never told me as a baby or toddler that her ear even hurt. She ended up with such hearing loss that she had to have an ear transplant operation.  She hears most sounds but you don't want your baby to go through what she did.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I have never heard of an ear check.<br>  <br>  I would take her to the doctor to make sure.  It can get really painful and you want to get the meds if necessasary before she wakes in the night screaming for hours(this has happend toboth my kids)  Also if the ear infection is bad and the eardurm is buldging it could burst, which is VERY painful.|`|dHH4Rl2yaa	I would take her to the doctor.  They can give you a more accurate answer.  Usually tugging on the ear or something similar is in fact a symptom of an ear infection.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	If she is picking at her ears then it is worth a visit.  Ear infections that go untreated can lead to hearing loss.  Not to mention your kiddo isn't feeling well and no mother wants their kid to suffer.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i am not sure about that device, but i know that my daughter tends to get ear infections a lot (she gets that from me i got them a lot too).  and her dr. said just watch it for 3 days and if there is  a fever or isn't getting better to bring her in.  if it starts to get better on its own after 3 days don't do anything it will cure it's self after that.  Not all ear infections need medicine.  getting antibiotics for all ear infections can lead to antibiotic Resistance.  sometimes i would take my daughter in sooner and her dr. would give her a prescription and say just don't start it for 3 days, but here it is in case it doesn't go away.  you can give her some Tylenol for pain, if older than 6 months ibuprofen works better (per my pediatricians advice).  if you are worried just call her dr. and ask what their recommendations are.|`|FSxjalLdaa	it should work
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Sounds like they are playing favorites.|`|9d9vKQMqaa	Maybe it is because your coach has favoritism for this girl. Maybe you should talk to your parents about this & have them talk to the coach or talk to him yourself 7 tell him how that wasn't fair. Maybe you should talk to that girl & tell her how she should have apologized.
SlBsJ3NRaa	Parental pressure is worse. You can cut contact with anyone you want when you're friends. If your parents expect everything out of you, there's no avoiding that situation. If you're under the age 18, parental pressure is something you will have to deal with until you move out.<br>  <br>  Edit: I've heard of kids killing themselves because their parents expectations were too high, they were never good enough. Again, peer pressure you can walk away from. Parental pressure you can't.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	The things that you are stating are "parental pressures" are all positive things. You mean to tell me that you have parents that expect you to be the best you can be in all you do, and live out the values that they raised you with, because of their years of wisdom and life experience? This is exactly the type of pressure that gets you on honor roll, the football team and into college. I fail to see in what way this is harmful, in fact they should be given an award for their good work.<br>  <br>  Whereas peer pressure can lead to great things, it often leads to other things like smoking, drinking, "just trying" drugs, sex before you are ready to handle the responsibilities etc. <br>  <br>  In closing, NO I do not think parental pressure is more damaging. I would argue that there is no such thing as parental pressure, in the way that you have defined it, rather those are parents that are guiding their kids in life.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Well, which would be worse, "doing your best at everything" to please your parents or getting drunk, high, or pregnant just to fit in with your friends?  <br>  <br>  I don't know any parents who pushed their kids to be perfect.  True, some go overboard on wanting their kids to excel at everything, and that can make the high school years less than carefree, but I don't know any kids who suffered permanent damage from that.|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Parental pressure comes from a loving place where all is wanted is the best for you.  Parents just want you to aim for the stars and shoot for the moon.  If you come up a bit short, at least you tried your best.  The shame comes from a parent underestimating their child or never encouraging the child to aim high.  Remember...good parents have their heart and soul invested in you.  Your friends don't come close to that commitment.<br>  <br>  Peer pressure is just another case of misery loving company.  Many instances of peer pressure can be life altering and irreversible.  Certainly does not come from a place of love.  The rare instance where peer pressure can be positive still doesn't bring that kid to the best place they could end up.  The world is full of pressure whether it be in a marriage, career or finances.  If all the pressure a kid feels from parents is their desire for the best for their child, they've had it good.  Of course, this is only talking about parents who are not using their child as a status symbol or who never consider their child's personality and feelings.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Parental pressure, although wrong is not harmful, whereas peer pressure can lead to any number of dangerous & harmful activiteis and consequences of those activities.<br>  Parental pressure generally leads to a breakdown in relationship between child and parents which can be very very hard to repair, but the harm that peer pressure can cause can be irreversible and devestating.|`|dcc00da4a672d60c97d41b26eabd27d0aa	It depends on what kind of parent you have, and what kind of peer pressure, if any, you receive.<br>  Personally, I never got pressure from my peers. Sure, kids at school got high and drunk, but nobody ever came up to me and tried to get me to join them. <br>  However, my mother was always pressuring me. And not in the typical way. She would chastise me daily about not having a boyfriend. She told me popularity is the most important thing in the world and that I needed to get a boyfriend. She bought me a box on condoms when I was 14!!! She wanted me to go out and start having sex!<br>  It was the negative pressure from her that made me abstain till I was in college, lol.<br>  But most ordinary kids would probably listen to her if she was their mom. She yes, in that case parental pressure is harmful.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Mentally parental pressure is probably more harmful, you can tell your friends get f**ked if their annoying you, but if you said that to your parents you'd have a gang of old people wanting to beat you.<br>  <br>  Peer pressure is clearly wrong and every one will agree and be on your side but with parental pressure people say "it's because they love you, you spolit little sh*t".|`|bImYoZsraa	Honestly, I think that peer pressure is more harmful.  Any peers who would pressure you into doing stupid things just to fit in are not real friends.  If they were real friends, they would put your life and your health above everything else.  Your parents, however, generally say or do things with your well-being in mind.  Do parents screw up occasionally?  Of course, but in the end, they always want what's best for you.|`|SimAO1IUaa	idk i never got parental or peer pressure at all. but if i did, i think teens try to impress their friends more of course so i would say peer pressure is more damaging.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	No, your parents only want the very best for you...friends and classmates who try to push you into doing something stupid don't care about you.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Ooo, this is a good question. I'll be back to read all the answers. <br>  <br>  To me it would be parental pressure. I was never overcome by peer pressure. I was always the leader. Although the pressure of doing something that might disappoint your parents.... Dissapointing your parents is so much worse than pissing them off, or is that just me?
uE0jhj9Qaa	yes you can and id suspect that it will become more clear in the next day or so! Good luck!|`|QKGuNLb4aa	im pretty sure you can the egg white cm indicates that you will ovulate soon or thats what my dr told me, he said that when you actually ovulate your cm is thin and strechy which is best for sperm
1VOsRV8Maa	This isn't really an answer, but possibly a light at the end of your tunnel. you say you're pregnant again? Most likely, your older daughter will straighten up a bit when she becomes the "big sister." A lot of children go through that, and suddenly they "grow up" a bit when they become the older sibling! :) I won't ever really experience that "only child syndrome" since my baby will only be 15 months old when I have this next baby! :) Good luck, though! I'm sure your little girl will be just fine. If you don't get a lot of encouragement from other answers, let this one be your glimmer of hope... :)|`|2pxiK9waaa	Take some Gymboree and swim classes with her, get a sitter a day or two a week so you can have a break and she gets used to others. Go on playdates and playgroups, hit the library for reading time.|`|KaOgEgEFaa	This is about the age when a child starts to notice when you are gone (separation anxiety).  When my son and daughter went through this it did not last to long -- although at the time it seamed like a life time.  Just be patient and hang in there.  If you take her to day care kiss her and let her know you will see her later... When I use to leave my son crying the day care would tell me that my son was fine in a matter of minutes.  It will pass :-)|`|AA11256693	They go through these stages. The best thing really to do is ride it out, because the more you try to force them away, the more they will want to cling to their safety Mom.|`|bh6QrzWraa	Tough love!<br>  You will just need to tough it out. She knows that if she cries long enough you will give in and pick her up that's why she does it. Tell her that she is heling you when she is on the floor and praise her often such as "It helps mummy when you can walk to the bathroom by youself. WHat a good girl you are" With this, and some tough love, she will eventually learn that its nice to not be held. My son (now 18 months old) has just come out of the same thing. I never held him much, but he learnt the word "Up" and would ask everybody (even the shop assistents) to lift him "Up"  and thats what i did  - tough love and lots of praise!!<br>  Good luck, I hope it works for you like it did for me!
jNgh3e3Faa	Walk (and accept the fate of the pregnant woman)!<br>  I bet you are lovely.<br>  Your weight gain is perfect, too.<br>  Just enjoy having your baby to yourself. (that was my problem...after delivery I missed being pregnant so much...baby is much safer in the uterus..)<br>  <br>  They also have yoga for pregnant women, too. <br>  I never tried it...can't hurt..|`|AA10719805	I really don't think that you can get rid of it. Your face should go back to its normal size after you have your little prince. I have had three kids and with every pregnancy my nose has spread and I got a double everything. But things went back to normal in my face after I had them.

HclKftzAaa	when you release an egg (ovulation) the hormonal changes leading up to this event actually started about 2 weeks before actual ovulation. (This usually coincides with the first day of your last period).<br>  <br>  So, when ppl say a pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, they are including the extra two weeks from before ovulation. As soon as you ovulate/conceive, the pregnancy is technically two weeks along.<br>  <br>  hope that helps :) (I don't know why they don't just say pregnancy is 38 weeks, it's just the way doctors decided it should be long ago).|`|wiAVa1H5aa	For the average woman, a menstrual cycle is 28 days (not all women have that length, just the average) - ovulation is usually on day 14, or 14 days before the start of the next period.   Conception occurs within 12-24 hours of ovulation, but you are not pregnant with ovulation - you're pregnant with implantation when the embryo's placenta burrows into the endometrium.   <br>  <br>  Blah blah, blah... ANYWAY, for convenience sake docs can really ask moms to be when they ovulated, but they can ask when the first day of your last period was - and start pregnancy dating from that to keep track of fetal development.   If your cycle is long or short, they will simply add the weeks or take them away based on the length of your cycle - or do a vaginal ultrasound early on to determine embryonic size and establish conception.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Pregnancy weeks go based on your last period and since most woman ovulate 2 weeks after they get their period, essentially you are correct.  For most woman on the day they have sex and get pregnant they are actually already 2 weeks pregnant.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	They say this because doctors will count from the first day of your last period...even though you weren't really pregnant then.<br>  <br>  Let's say you're last period started January 1st and you ovulated and conceived a baby on Jan 14th.  By the time your period is due on Jan 28th you would be considered 4 weeks pregnant.  (Even though you're technically only 2 weeks).  <br>  <br>  I know, it makes no sense!  But since it's almost impossible to determine the date of conception, doctors find it much easier to determine how far along a woman is in her pregnancy by counting the weeks starting with the last period.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...and sorry if I confused you more!  :)|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	your pregnancy starts from the date of your LMP (last menstrual period), or the first day of your period. By the "miss" your period you find out you are already considered 4 weeks. But don't worry pregnancy math gets you once again, because you are pregnant for 40 weeks, which is longer then the 9months you were thinking it was for! Good Luck :)|`|JxRG1lJAaa	-- please help me too cause i need to know also ive been wondering.<br>   email; im.so_happyie@yahoo.com

D35xKICoaa	50 50 chance but continue to try your day will come just relax.....|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i would just relax. you can only wait and take a test. i was 15 days late for my period and my home test was negative. then i took a blood test at the doctors and it was negative. then i went back to the doctors and they re-tested me and i was actually 5 weeks. so don't test to early. in my case i didn't show pregnant until 5 weeks! don't think of a negative result "getting your hopes up" just think you can have more fun trying!!!! it took me a year and half!!!! it was a fun year and half. it was also i really tuff year with many ups and downs! so just relax that's my advice! relaxing was the ONLY think that worked for me.<br>  <br>  baby dust|`|W8M5pQ4faa	you need to figure out when you ovulate.  Although most women ovulate about midway in their cycle, every woman is different.  I have a 28 day cycle and ovulate on day 16.  You can use ovulation predictor kits or you can take your temperature and chart it throughout your cycle, or you can look for the "egg white" discharge that happens near ovulation.  There is lots of info on the internet about these options.  for this potential pregnancy, you will just have to wait and see!
D35xKICoaa	have nothing to do with your age that is how it is when you reach that stage you will soon get over it wish you safe delivery....|`|Nv1RE9tOaa	yes it does.
P5Iq6nufaa	Why would you think you ruined your family over a stolen car? Your dad and mom will figure something out. You messed up big time by taking the car without permission and you deserved to be disciplined, but you need to apologize and get things moving on. Your dad probably overreacted and feels awful about it now. Just to note, even though many may not agree with how he disciplined you, it is NOT abuse if the worse you have out of it is a sore butt for the rest of the day. You probably had that coming. It seems odd that your dad would decide to spank you like that when he has never done so before; usually parents who don't spank for 16 years don't because they don't believe in it as a means of discipline. But your dad was obviously shocked by your behavior and felt you needed to be dealt with harshly. <br>  <br>  You know, 30+ years ago or so, what your dad did was a fairly common punishment for a teen even for less serious matters. You need to learn from it.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	first you cant be in serious trouble as you can still be on the computer.  you did somethng wrong and got caught, deal witht the punishment|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	He is abusing you. You should be grateful if he never talks to you again. He was spanking you out of anger, and he should be ashamed of himself. No, you did not "Ruin your family". He should be happy you weren't kidnapped, let alone the car. No father should be yanking down anyone pants and underwear, let alone on a 16 year old girl. They can rent a car until they can get that one back. Rentals are Cheap, it's no big deal. He could have just grounded you from driving, or going out with your boyfriend. There was no need to get physical. Makes me sick.|`|tptPX0DJaa	I believed this until you got to the part of pulling your pants and underwear down.  If this is true, you made one huge mistake, you're going to have to deal with it.  If either of my children stole my car and then got it stolen they would not see the light of day until I said they could.|`|1KqknaUHaa	I think the messed up part of this story is that your father pulled your pants and underpants down and spanked you.<br>  <br>  a little creepy and gross.<br>  You're 16 right?<br>  <br>  They're just going to have to get over it, nothing more they can do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  * <br>  I really can't imagine a father doing that to his 16 year old daughter.<br>  I think that is abuse and VERY weird.<br>  <br>  I'm on your side.<br>  It was an accident, a very BIG accident and should be grounded or something for it but what happened I think was wrong.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Yeah, the pulling down the pants, what the hell? I think hes over stepped the mark a bit. But hey it all seems a bit to much right now but it will blow over and be forgotten. The car was insured so all good.<br>  Your dad over reacted a little I think, so chill out go to bed all will sort out.|`|XpoJkke6aa	First of all you are 16 this is actually just one of the mistakes you will make in your life.Oh and don't get mad at me, cause i used to be spanked with a hickory, but that was funny.... sorry, any way i even talked to my mom and she said your dad loves you of course, he was just mad, you might wanna think of apologizing though, and kiss your dreams of driving before you are 18 a very long goodbye! just apologize and then let them ground you and just agree that was a big thing you did, but your dad does Not hate you, he was just mad and apparently he wanted to take it out on your butt, literally. hope i helped.|`|aQQ4uQhdaa	your dad should of not overreacted like that. he should apologize. he also should of not hit you like that. i consider that abuse. expecially when you are 16.. and he pulled your UNDERWEAR down. thats not right  at all. he has no right.|`|eya1WDS4aa	he doesn't hate you. But dont expect to be trusted for a long time. i dont agree with the first post, i think you pretty much got what you deserved for stealing your dads car and then being careless and getting it really stolen. but hun he doesn't hate you he still loves you he is just very angry, he will calm down in a few days, just let him know you are really sorry. and i would start doing tons of house work and try and pay back Your father and mother for what happend.|`|q29V00o2aa	First off... No. You didn't ruin your family.<br>  Now, taking the car was probablly not the best idea but I think you know that. Your dad has a right to get mad though. In my opinion he overacted and shouldn't have spanked you, but some people freak out a little or lose their temper in situations involving stress or worry; different people handle it different ways. I completly think he will forgive you, just give it a little while.<br>  Also, keep hopeing that the car gets found soon. The chances of it being close by and your dad getting it back sound pretty high to me so beleive in that. Even if it doesn't get found, there's still insurence and at the worse, there's a lot of places that sell cars cheap. My dad buys car for $200 that last a year-kinda shitty but it'll work unti a new cars afordable.<br>  You mom sounds like she's in shock but still taking this a lot better than your dad, so that is an indicator that your family will be back together and fine soon; she'll prbablly be the one to do it.<br>  Anyway, you didn't RUIN anything, it can all be fixed. And at least you understand that taking the car without permission was bad. I highly think that your dad just freaked out(who wouldn't?) and he'll be feeling better tomorrow and he'll just give you some kind of big punishment like grounding.<br>  Things will be better in no time, try not to be scared.<br>  Good luck and I really hope things work out for you =]|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Oh hell no! You are 16 and your father pulled your pants down to spank you? And your mom didn't intervene?<br>  There is something VERY wrong on how your dad handled this situation. Granted, he was angry and you are not excused by your actions either but his overreaction I would believe is abuse. No parent can be excused from this. He did not handle this correctly as a parent should. <br>  I cannot blame him for being upset, but he needs a lecture in the parenting department.<br>  And no you didn't ruin the family. You are a teenager. Parents will deal with stupid stuff teenagers do. It's to be expected. My son stole my car and CRASHED it. I didn't pull his pants down and spank him. He was 15 at the time and his punishment was that he had to wait till he was 18 to get a drivers license. <br>  I promise you that this will eventually cool down. The teens are a tough age to go through. Take this as a lesson learned.<br>  You have a lot of making up to do in the trust department.|`|yNInHaMPaa	It may seem horrible now, but what you did was wrong. He has every right to be upset at you. But if he has never yelled at you before, or anything else, he must be a very patient man and really love you. Let things cool down. Time will go on, and things will get better. A car shouldnt (and dosent seem like) it will be a burden on the love of your family.|`|d3a46b88a8d68770c4ef27cf2ed1fbd6aa	I wouldn't be worried about your dad yelling and being angry right now.  I'd be more concerned about him taking your clothes off and spanking you.<br>  I totalled my mom's car off 13 hours after I got my drivers license.  She was furious but got over it pretty quickly.<br>  Hang in there.|`|lPlOvSkTaa	omg!! im so sorry <br>  but i think he will forgive u in acouple of months<br>  but it will take along time for him to trust you again.<br>  <br>  no you didnt ruin your family but now they have to spend alot of money on a new care.<br>  im sorry <br>  and you should have goten your @ss beat<br>  do my question please|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Your dad acted out of anger. How he handled himself was very wrong!|`|CaKu7gbAaa	don't worry let things cool down, just pray to god that insurance company provides whole loss to your dad so that your dad can buy another care and afterwards never commit such mistakes. your dad is upset and angry at you but he will forgive you surely. you should learn lesson from this that never lie to your parents or never make them fool. god wanted to make you understand this. don't worry just relax and relax your dad also . apologize him and ur mum. pray to god to shower his blessings on u and ur family to come out of this hard time.
E2UXN7J1aa	Trauma to the abdomen can cause a miscarriage. I hope that you aren't considering doing that to yourself.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	No. Your body provides a lot of insulation- you would have to fall from a great height to jeopardize your pregnancy, and in that case you would be jeopardizing your own life, as well.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be pregnant, speak to a doctor about the options available to you. Having someone punch you or punching yourself is not going to do anything.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	well this depends on impact. something like a car accident may kill your baby, but also may not. you baby is protected by your womb, but hard impact could kill the baby... like sleeping on your belly and that kind of  pushing will or should not cause a miscarriage but really hard impact can. <br>  <br>  did something happen to you?|`|AA11763588	At 2 weeks pregnant (which you really wouldn't know you were) it is still an egg of cells, literally so small it would fit on the head of a pin.<br>  <br>  Pretty hard to do anything to it at that point.|`|HOdblqIkaa	if you push on it no, but if your hit really hard or in just the right spot yes. theyre pretty protected in there but its still possible.|`|9hggEdf1aa	No it can not.  If you do not want this baby then go to a professional or consider adoption.|`|DNygQdmVaa	first off you wouldn even know your pregnant ar 2 weeks.<br>  and 2nd it would be very hard.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	At only "2 weeks pregnant", that's only ovulation.  Assuming the egg is fertilized and implanted on your uterus, you wouldn't even be getting a positive pregnancy test yet.  Its completely undetectable at this stage of 'pregnancy'.  Too small to see with any kind of medical equipment even.  So no, getting hit in the stomach or pushing on the stomach wouldn't hurt a thing.|`|KyhnSRrJaa	Not likely... the baby is so small at 2 weeks, and so well protected that most bumps will not hurt it.  For a bump to hurt your baby, you would be putting your own life at risk also.  The baby has your uterus, the amniotic sack, and your stomach muscles protecting it.  Try to be careful, but if you accidentally bump your stomach or have some kid throw a basketball at you like what happened to me, don't worry about it too much.  Your baby is well protected :)|`|zHmZkMStaa	It's possible, I suppose.  But it's much more likely that you'll give birth to a brain damaged baby.  Are you up for that burden?  Get a legal abortion or give the baby up for adoption.  There are even couples out there who will pay for your care and to ensure your comfort while pregnant.|`|7xit1ogxaa	This is a sick question. At 2 weeks pregnant you wouldn't even know you were pregnant, conception would have just occurred.|`|BMfaF8oBaa	Why would you ask such a thing? Wow, and i dont believe it would.|`|KA5nhL1uaa	that's sick.|`|70kh6VSoaa	ummmm yea|`|94kNwMPdaa	i hope your not considering doing that to yourself<br>  not only will it kill the baby. but also some miscarriages can be so bad that the mother could hemorrhage which would lead to death. or have scar tissue left in the uterus making it very hard for her to get pregnant in the future|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Why, are you trying to kill your baby? It didn't ask to be put there. You did the deed now you have to suffer the consequences.  If you kill your baby it's murder.|`|b7a7b6437a7b32c214a558f73ed27e54aa	I would hope that you are not going to this!

QpSbFVYbaa	I love that you want to be diplomatic about family matters, but IMO this is your child, pick a name you love. <br>  <br>  <br>  I wish I knew the name, it might make my answer easier but I will try:<br>  Can you vary the spelling of the name to make it unique? <br>  Can the name be combined with another name (ex: Mary Ann instead of Mary)?<br>  Can the name have a nick associated with it? (I have a grandbaby named Alyssa, we call her Lele)<br>  <br>  Just some suggestions that maybe you can still use the name you chose for your child. Considering your Aunties baby is your cousin and not your baby's cousin, I think the relationship distance is acceptable to be able and use the same name if you are not able to use a variation. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I pray you have a healthy, happy baby regardless of the name you pick!|`|1VOsRV8Maa	My sister and my aunt both have boys with the name Cole. I have a huge family, and we don't see all our aunts and uncles a lot, so it may be a little different. I don't see why it should be a problem, because you already had that name picked. I'd say use it anyhow! :)|`|IA5zVfk0aa	my sister and cousin pretty much have the same name, christie and christina.. but they use nicknames, i dont see anything wrong with it.. but sorry she used the name before you
BqqDJXkjaa	He could just be coming down with a cold. Definatly take him to the dr - unless you want a restless night sleep - he will listen to his chest and make sure it's not asthma or infection.|`|RSczEcZCaa	He may have bronchitis if that cough persists so i suggest you bring him to the pedia right away. It's safer to ask prescription from the doctor than medicating him yourself.|`|CvESLNnkaa	If it has really weird almost sea otter sound to it it could be croup.  My son has had that twice, it sounds really bad but usually clears up on its own and we are in peak season.  Most coughs are not emergencies but if it is worse tomorrow you could always call you pediatricians talk to the nurse before you bring him in.

You gotta keep your babies healthy.    If he's sick.... he's sick.|`|e2418c6e8d0da824f34f3e464d3ea786aa	If he is running a fever take him to the doc. Try Musinex for kids to break up the mucus, and blow his nose. They also have the saline spray for kids. My daughter has the same thing. I took her to the ER, she has two ear infections. Dont chance it. Take him to the doc.|`|aaSlF0gnaa	Don't worry give him some  cough medicine and put raper rub on his neck and chest after bath & before bed . You may need to re apply raper rub in the night.if he starts running fever take him to Dr. in the morning.
umca7pwoaa	The right pelvic side is known to hurt more and sooner than the left side due to your uterus being tilted slightly more to the right side.<br>  <br>  However, it could also be the sign of a blood clot in your groin area. Pregnant women are more prone to blood clots even if they've never had one or don't have any pre-disposition to them. <br>  <br>  It could be nothing or may be serious. Consult your healtcare provider about it and it'll put your mind at ease.|`|NMzlbWt8aa	During pregnancy your pelvis/hip area will grow or spread wider to accommodate the baby. Im 21wks and going through it myself.|`|HikylB4Taa	I'm sorry but it is normal. It varies from person to person when the hips/pelvic starts widening but that's what it is and it is completely normal. Just talk to ur doctor maybe he can get u a light anti-inflammatory or maybe u can just take Ibuprofen. I hated that part, as I'm sure u do too. Good luck!
Qydtjz2naa	It's my first year in high school, so I don't have too much expirence, but I'll give you what I know so far. <br>  <br>  1. School is number one.  That doesn't mean you have to obsess over it, but colleges will look at  your gpa from all your years so keep the grades up.  <br>  2. Get on the teachers good side, without sucking up.  Just answer questions and do homework.  But it will be obvious if you're trying too hard, and it will no longer look good.<br>  3. Do extra curriculars.  Colleges will look at this, but they're also really fun, and you can find interesting ones.  They're also a great way to meet new people.<br>  4. Pick out classes for YOU, not because your friends want them.  Picking out good classes are hard, and it might take a few tries before you find the subject you're interested in.  Now, I'm not saying don't have friends in your class, but if your friend is trying to convince you to take a class your're not interested in, don't take it.<br>  5. Be nice to everyone!  Even people that you don't see yourself being friends with.  You never know where that "nerd" you insulted will end up, they could be your boss one day.<br>  6. Don't limit yourself to one type of person.  High school has a lot of different types of people, some you will like, some you will not.  But don't pass up a good friend oppurtunity because you think they dress weird.  Try to meet people in different groups.<br>  7. Care about your looks, but don't stress over them.  People will tell you no one cares what people think, but honestly, people do care.  As shallow as it may be, that is what high school is.  As I said, don't obsess over them, but put effort into how  you look, people will notice.<br>  8. Don't miss school, don't ditch class.  Missing a day or two is okay if you're sick, but when you miss a lot, you fall behind.  In my high school many people skip class, and they end up falling way behind.  Come to class as much as possible.<br>  9. Make friends who won't pressure you.  Peer pressure is a huge thing in high school, be around the type of people that wont pressure you into making mistakes.<br>  10. Be yourself.  People will be able to see right through you if you are putting up a fake personality. <br>  <br>  Those are my ten tips.  Every high school is different, but many will have the same types of things.  High school is really fun, I love it!  It's not as scary as you may think.  Oh! I just though of another tip: When you around upper classmen, don't act how you would around freshman. Still be yourself, but fart jokes are no longer funny to 18 year olds.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, but you won't need it, high school is amazing.|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	ahhh <br>  ONE: ENJOY 8TH grade year, hs is such a challenge and your not spoon fed.n<br>  TWO. HS is pretty much the best years of your life. But remember to focus on your grades<br>  THREE: POPULARITY really isnt anything, just be yourself and find good friends. but try to stay in between not total loser but dont become part of the A crowd<br>  FOUR:don't pretend to be someone your not.<br>  FIVE: Just enjoy highschool , its the best part of your life<br>  -dnt fall for upperclass men<br>  -party with your friends<br>  -change your style-your starting off new<br>  -make smart choices<br>  -ect...<br>  lots of luck !|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Surviving high school.<br>  Do your best at your work, HAND IT IN ON TIME, and get on the teachers good side. It DEFINATELY pays off. <br>  You do not want to get held back, or have to handle another freshman class.<br>  <br>  Enjoy making new friends, but don't ditch your old ones, fall in the wrong crowd, or give in to peer pressure. It could be tempting.|`|n1mwxljzaa	i'm a freshman & i loveeeee it<br>  the guys at my school are verrrrrrrry hot!|`|JCtpcECSaa	It's not that different from middle school. The teachers all treat the freshmen like little kids and as long as you don't do anything obnoxious or weird the seniors won't bother you. You definitely won't see your friends as much as you do in middle school and the classes are a lot more boring. And longer, in my school at least. Guy wise, all i have to say is don't date a senior! So many girls in my school are dating guys 3+ years older than them and they only want one thing!|`|4cAjMc5Vaa	Well I'm in HS as a Sophomore. I'll tell you how to deal with upper class men.<br>  <br>  They will sub you for a while until they look past your grade. DO NOT annoy them. Most of them hate Hannah Montana and other Disney brand junk, except for the ones you would be better off away from.<br>  As a freshmen, avoid Senior boys. You may think he likes you, but he just wants one thing from you. I've seen countless 2012 girls get messed over by even boys in my grade. Think, there is a reason girls in their own grade don't like them.<br>  <br>  Be sure to take ADV and AP classes where ever you can. It's weighted differently. Even if you get a D it counts as a C which passes you.<br>  <br>  Don't be shy! Talk to everyone with kindness and don't be afraid to ask to sit with people.Look for people from your classes to eat with at lunch.|`|MDsjS3Fjaa	ok well good luck and hope u have fun for one<br>  im n 10th grade and i think the best thing would to do would actually get ur work done and do well it really helps. and stay cool with some of the teachers it can pay off sometimes. another think sometimes its good 2 do extra work but u probly know this.<br>  ok on the friends side it would b good to have many friends this also helps for things like knowing where to go who to hang out with or so ur not alone during homecoming/lunch.<br>  hope u have fun next ur and good luck<br>  let me know if u have anymore questions im good with helping 4 relationship stuff^^|`|NYJgiVxraa	higshcool is soooo much bettter then gradeschool! much more people of your kind to meet. and people are more mature, altho not everyone is lool. anyways, its fun thats fo s sho. 1 hour lunchtimes in stead of liek 20 mins lol its great for sure.|`|0gMBjOVXaa	do you know others who are going with you? because chances are you will find it easier that way.|`|TYxbaE4paa	It sucks =/|`|jDmXXz3xaa	dont pick your nose|`|lvvm9MMiaa	Towards the end of my senior year, I put together a list of things I learned in high school. Maybe some of it will be helpful?<br>  <br>  - Driving really fast in the parking lot does not make you cool. It just makes you an idiot that's driving really fast in the parking lot.<br>  - Blocking the entire 200's wing and preventing certain people from getting to AP Government isn't cool. Go babble about stupid things IN your classes, thanks. (Lesson: don't stand around in the middle of the hallway.)<br>  - Being disruptive in class isn't funny. It's just annoying. Shut up already.<br>  - Primping in front of the girl's bathroom mirror doesn't make you look better. You're just wasting your time and blocking the paper towels.<br>  - Ugg boots are really... really ugly.<br>  - Do not wear shirts with bold statements if you can't back them up. "This is why I'm hot?" Oh, believe me, it's not.<br>  - If a senior tells you a class is "fun," don't take it. They're lying to you so that you, too, will suffer.<br>  - The worst thing ever is standing in the locker bays. Apparently if you stand in them, the world will implode.<br>  - Not caring what people think of you is truly liberating.<br>  - Walking against the 2:18 crowd is really hard.<br>  - Teachers are people, too!<br>  - It is perfectly fine to not drink/smoke/etc. You'll still have fun, you'll still have friends, and you won't have as many damaged nerve cells. Win, win, win.<br>  - The best way to avoid being hated as a freshman is to avoid being loud and obnoxious. Too bad most of them don't.<br>  - Underclassmen, please do not have your parents drop you off in the junior-senior parking lot. Go through the carpool line like you're supposed to. It just ticks us off in the morning.<br>  - "Trendy" does not necessarily translate into "looks good."<br>  - Getting good grades and doing well in class is good. People will not respect you if you sleep, never do you homework ever, or make an *** of yourself the whole block.<br>  - Nobody really cares if your class is hard. We all have hard classes. Suck it up.<br>  - Before you groan and say "Omg, *insert name*, you're soooo smart!" because he or she knows the answers, consider that they actually work hard and study. It is possible to know all the answers without being brilliant.<br>  - Please do not declare your undying love for someone after dating for two weeks. It's hackneyed and annoying.<br>  <br>  Also, take the time to get to know a few upperclassmen. They're not all snobs. Trust me. : )|`|Jucak0HLaa	It's not that bad.Just don't act stupid,or people will call you a stupid little freshman all the time.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	its not like the movies at all.<br>  its exactly like middle school, only less drama and its a bigger school.<br>  upperclassmen are a little rude, not bad. just stay out of their way and DONT fall for an older guy. they dont like any frosh unless theyre super hot.<br>  my advice is to branch out, make a lot of friends and have fun!
tcHkn0VIaa	Yes you can develop mastitis or a clogged duct, you can try applying a warm compress and if that does not work I would call your ob to find out what is going on, Good Luck|`|4YCsXqMDaa	yeah its normal, and its cause the milk bags are growing and so are your boobs lol, if your nervous call ur doc. office tomorrow and they can schedule something to check them out if ur nervous : ) <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	wow. i was just about to ask the same question<br>  <br>  this is my first pregnancy and am 7 months tomorrow.<br>  <br>  thanks for asking this.<br>  <br>  star for you!
u94HOVz7aa	thats what my babies did.  they did that for a couple months crawled for maybe a week, then stood up and walked.  but when they didnt feel like walking they would roll rather than crawl.  their dr. said hey they found a way to get around who need to crawl as long as they learn to crawl at some point it doesnt matter what order they learn to move around<br>  <br>  <br>  when my babies would lay on their bellies and pull their legs up i would put my hands behind them so when they straightened them they would move forward.  this is how i encouraged them to crawl. after a while they caught on, they just didnt like to crawl.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	he probably doesn't feel a strong need to crawl since he can get everywhere already; mine 'scoots' everywhere and since she learned that she isnt interested in actual crawling...and she can scoot fast!!|`|g9vw4ovGaa	My daughter did the military low crawl, she never did the normal crawl. I don't see any reason to worry, all children are different, i'd say instead of encouraging him to crawl, encourage to walk, or to stand. Move on to the next step|`|nhgQKvwEaa	that is too cute, i've never seen a baby rolling instead of crawling :) babies learn at their own pace, all babies are different. He'll probably skip the crawling phase and go straight to walking.
9d9vKQMqaa	The first answer was pretty good but since you guys have such a close friendship don't like get mean with it because that could jeopardized it. Try talking to him about it & ask if he wants to be with you & if he doesn't to just let you be friends & nothing else.|`|w38FLTPNaa	I like the 1st answer personally :D<br>  You should play hard to get next time he does that. Just push him away :D|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	No, he's just a flirt, who wants many girls.<br>  Leave him be, he needs a rejection. Next time he tries to put his arms around you, push him away, and tell him to go hug on another girl.|`|dB6MR0wYaa	well if youre not going out then why get upset
MHOxPs8Oaa	There's a bunch that I know.|`|bqqGZfiSaa	there all over the place where i live! we have teen haven country club for teens (only $10 admission) got pool,movies,gym dancing all in 1 place you just can't drink/fight|`|pbrXWj6Raa	i like karate's answer.|`|atrObg5saa	i agree with you
ggfE4rlvaa	All these pregnancy questions and the guy never "ejaculates" people need to start having better sex! If she's having symptoms the day after you had sex with her, it's probably not your kid..sorry that's WAY to early for symptoms, and way to close to her period for her to miss it. Takes a week for a baby to implant and get the pregnancy ball rolling.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I can't assume it's not your kid, but if she is now, then it's from something happening before.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	she would not be fertile the day before her period was due if she had a regular cycle!  she is probably stressed because she doesnt understand how it all works.  time to teach yourselves about your bodies before anymore sex!|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	She shouldn't have been late because of sex on the 14th.  I doubt she's pregnant but if she is, it's because of an accident in the past more than likely.  She needs to try taking another test on like the 15th of next month just incase.  Maybe she just hasn't started bc of stress.|`|MHeOHOnbaa	well yes and no the test would normally come up negative this early so i suggest you wait a while and take another one and those are not necessarily signs of pregnancy|`|FIdA3FiCaa	she's probably stressed out, thinking that should could be pregnant, which will cause her period to be later than normal.<br>  <br>  buttttt anything can happen!
AA11763588	Odds are he won't put you on work release unless you are having stress induced contractions. I have them all the time but because they aren't bad enough (at least 4 strong ones in an hour) there really isn't anything they can tell me but to stop stressing out, easier said then done.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|BzCYQlcuaa	can you cut back your hours?<br>  <br>  i take yoga and a stress Relief class... this really helps me with way to deal with stress.|`|HOdblqIkaa	talk to your boss about the amount of work you are doing and the effect it is having on your pregnancy and see if he or she will help you out. if your dr doesnt seem concerned then you should switch to a new dr but going on a break from work for 17 plus weeks is a long time and not worth it. try to cut back on hours or work from home if you can. if your job is physical get someone to help you.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I'd try to talk to your boss.  If you think that'll make him fire you or something, then start looking for a job and quit when you find one.  I doubt you'll be put on work release until you have the baby.  It depends on your job though.  Could they hire someone else and you could still have your job after the baby was born?  Like if you are a cashier, or something like that where there are more than one of your job?  If so, and you don't need the money (which i assume you don't since you can be on leave for that long), then just get a job like at walmart or something temporarily and get insurance through them.  Some insurances will even let you stay on them after you quit your job as long as you pay for it... so you could work a simple job enough hours to pay for insurance until you want to quit!  Hope this helps!  that's the best suggestion i've got!|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Depending on what job you have, your employer should have put you in less stressful work environment by now.<br>  Go to your midwife, or another doctor and explain, stress is so bad for baby!!
PDAo1Z0Gaa	I like the kids co-op. Another good one is After the Stork,|`|cY8DgJv5aa	There was one in Kansas called "Kid to Kid".<br>  There's one here in Arkansas called "Lucky Duck Consignment" that does really well.<br>  <br>  I like the "Kids Co-Op" one.  That's kinda cute.  Since they have the choice of donating to charity, what about something with "heart" in it?  Charity is often referred to as "giving from the heart", so I think that would make sense.  I just can't think of something specific as far as a shop name goes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pO0s0bhHaa	My Kids Closet<br>                                  Boutique Consignment Shop<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!  Great idea to open this.|`|mNU0bEUsaa	Furtle Turtle?<br>  Baby Bumps R US?
