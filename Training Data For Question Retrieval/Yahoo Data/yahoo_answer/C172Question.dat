20090222191958AA4n74p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What do you think i should do?	hey, just wondering i haven't had a period since november last year, so i went to the doctor and had a blood test and an ultra sound, everything was normal except for slightly low estrogen levels. my doctor refered me to the specialist a couple of weeks ago and i'm still waiting for a reply.      i am still waiting for AF to show so should i start taking the pill again to bring AF back? i thought that is wat the specialist would do anyway so instead of waiting should i just start taking the pill again? if so where should i start? should i start in the red bit?      i hope this makes sense, please help i want a baby so bad just like everybody else does and im so sick of waiting

Okay, so he's 15  months on the 2nd (13 months corrected) and in the last 2 days he has stood up with out holding on to anything about 6 times.

I have known one longer than the other and she will have a special place in my heart. I am still trying to "figure out" the other teacher. Normally he is nice and very careful but yesterday I saw him be almost cruel with another student. (an adult student - im 16) I asked him for an explanation and he just matter of factly gave me one- i don't agree with it really. But now somethings changed Whenever I got scared or needed support I would call out my favorite teachers name just saying her name gave me strength but now I have started calling out for my other teachers name. But I don't know why I suddenly feel like I love him (like a father figure) I mean just the other day I saw him in a very unfavorable way but now its like I love him. I mean now Im scared of him slightly, and its like im meeting a whole new person and have know idea what he will do next- i don't like that. I like knowing exactly what to expect. Any ideas why i am feeling this way?

Actually everytime I'm changing her diaper he walks away, and says it's disturbing to see his baby sister naked. I told him he needs to get over it, and realize she's just a baby, and he's 15 years old, so he needs to help out once in awhile if I need him to change her diaper. Also I told him that eventually she's going to be taking off her diaper and running around naked. I said what are you going to do then and he said " go in his room, and shut the door" What can I do to make him stop acting so weird about his 7 month old sister being naked? She's a baby!

For a child to actually think that their vacation is coming to an end and they will begin a lot of studying. When I was like 5 or 6 and all my family was excited that I will go to school, I wasn't. I knew it was gonna be a lot of work. It was a dark day for me. I actually in my mind thought that my vacation was over and I had to begin many years of working hard. Is it normal for a child of 5 or 6 years to be thinking like that? I mean I actually considered myself on a long vacation like I was older and knew that hard work was coming. I knew it wasn't gonna be fun. I'm not sure how other kids felt but I think the average child would feel excited. I think that I was very smart in thinking like that. Because I knew school was gonna be cr*p. I knew I had long priveledge of vacation. I don't think a child of that age should be thinking like that.      What do you think?

20090222174244AAaTEAp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Can you get pregnant without having sex?	Me and my boyfriend were body-rubbing just after I had given him oral sex, and so there might have been a little *** on his tip. His tip brushed against my entrance a few times, and it felt very wet so we stopped because I don't want to get pregnant.       I'm only 17 and I'm going away to college in the fall and so neither of us wants a baby, plus my parents are very strictly moralistic and I don't think they'll allow me to have an abortion although that's what my boyfriend wants to do if I do end up pregnant.       I'm just wondering, how high of a chance is there of me getting pregnant from that? I know if the *** or pre-*** touches the vulva I can become pregnant but I'm not sure if that's just a one in a million thing or actually common...I'm just not sure.       Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated as I'm kinda scared, and yes, me and my boyfriend will be much more careful in the future. Also, if there is any more advice you can give me please share.       Thank you and God bless.
20090222174810AAmtubl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What's this song called!?	Ok. The song is like a pop/techno type and it sounded kinda like stripper music. The lyrics I remember are something like 'she's leaving but she'll be back later tonight' it's a girl singing it..   I seriously can't find it anywhere!   The beginning is just music for like 6 seconds or more..   She also says something like dance with me..   It MIGHT be more than one girl singing it too..      BTW I KNOW THIS IS UNDER THE WRONG CATEGORY, BUT MAYBE PEOPLE MY AGE WILL KNOW THE ANSWER!

She's told me that I am 90% effaced and I'm almost 2 centimeters dilated. My BH contractions are extremely strong. My membranes are swollen so much that she says I will probably break my water before I notice contractions. I'm afraid I won't make it to the hospital on time because I live 30 minutes away. I'm also afraid that my baby will be too large if I go past my due date as she is already 8 pounds.

He is feed every three hours, and refuses a bottle when he does this. It has been happening for the last month or so now. It usually last for an hour or less, until he falls asleep or is distracted long enough to stop. walking him around worked at first, but that is failing now. i am lost on what to do now. i am more worried about his safety and i hate to seem him cry like this.

20090222180142AAU6ml9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I have a question about potty training, can you help?	My son is just about 21 months old. He has been expressing an intrest in the potty now for about 3 months. He, at first, went pee sitting down and now for the past 3-4 weeks he has been peeing standing up by example of his dad. I was at first giving stickers for every pee and bowel movement until recently, I stopped giving stickers for every pee because he seemed to almost be holding back urine to come back to the potty again... For example he would pee a few small streams and might i add he seemed to be forcing himself, and then not even five minutes later he would come back to the potty and force out a small stream and a few drops. When I would say no at about the fifth time in a row he would throw a fit and pee a small amount in his underwear. SO..... I stopped the sticker reward after pee and was very matter of fact with going to the potty, "okay lets go potty, good job" no party or lots of praise...just to see if the frequency would slow down but really it hasn't. He never crys while going or anything so i wasn't sure if it could be like a uti or something. Im convinced its a power struggle but at the same time Im concerned because he has to "push" so hard for urine to come out and because of the weird frequency. I would like to add that I have already went through potty training with  my now three year old daughter without any snags. I know boys are differant but is this something you have experianced and if so how did you deal with it / fix it.
20090222185017AAlugrW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Looking for Opinions NOT facts...Rear facing car seat... want to switch it front facing...?	To start my son is 9 months old. He weighs 27 pounds and is 32" long. He's bigger than an average 1 year old already.      We have a Britax Boulevard which is currently rear facing. His feet are scrunched up against the back of the seat and he HATES it. Getting him in his car seat is beyond a task and I have found myself just not leaving the house because it is such a hassle...      Now I know all the rules perfectly fine (20 lbs AND 1 year of age) so don't beat a dead horse by telling me again.      On to the question. How many mother's have put their child forward facing early? How bad do you truly think it would be to switch him forward facing a couple of months early? I have been wrestling with the idea of this for days now and I would love to hear some insightful (non lecturing) opinions on this.      Thanks moms! I appreciate all your answers!

20090222182104AA3SO61	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Nighttime wakings following solids?	So at his 6 month checkup (two weeks ago) my dr suggested stepping up the solids(we started with cereals, not so successfully at 4 months) particularly the fruits and juice (due to my breastfed son only pooping every 10-15 days). for 10 days after that my son woke up every hour to hour and a half screaming in pain. i thought it was teething, until two days ago i decided i was too tired to feed him his solids (i know i sound lazy, but he was only eating 2-3 spoonfuls 2x daily anyhow). and that night he didn't wake. i tried not feeding him again yesterday, and the same results. SLEEP! So obviously today, we had no solids again. What I'm wondering is... has anyone else encountered a similar issue? How long did you wait before introducing solids again.

20090222185657AAM5yBq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My normally very active baby has been very lazy the past two days?	I'll be 34 weeks pregnant on tuesday and my baby is normally super active. Just wiggling and kicking AALLL the time. for the past two days she hasn't been moving a whole whole lot. She does move but it's not any kicks or anything. Just a little weak wiggling and shifting position. She's already head down and engaged and i was just wondering if it's possible that she had a very quick growth spurt and now just doesn't have much room. She's already putting severe pressure on my pelvis that has made me feel like having a BM for the past week or so. And I'm on bed rest because i've already started having contractions and gone into labor twice.      Does it sound like she may be too big? and they haven't given me that glucose test for gestational diabetes. Could they have checked my blood without drinking that drink?? And if my baby is too big will that put me into labor? i have been having back contractions i think the past 2 days but they aren't very regular so i'm thinking they're just BH contractions.       I'm gonna call my doc in the morning but if anyone has experienced any of this before i'd appreciate any stories or anything really. thank you and sorry it's so long lol

(per feeding how much should they eat...  i know that a breast fed baby won't over eat according to my lactation consultant, but a bottle fed baby will... so how do i know how much is right for a bottle feeding?)      2.  if i want to have more in a bag to freeze than i got in one pumping... can i take the amount pumped early in the day and refridgerate it and add to it later on in the day.  (i'm thinking after the second pumping cools to match the temperature of the first pumping) and THEN combine them into a bag to freeze?  i'm assuming that if i can do this that i'd want ot keep it within a twenty four hour period before combining to freeze?        any info would be greatly appreciated!!!  thanks guys!

20090222181947AAwqd1E	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	AGAIN - Breast Feeding 2.5week Old?	So I asked this question about breast feeding my baby girl:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...       First answer "feed her when she's hungry" (I have to wake her up to feed her because she's 2 and a half weeks old and sleeps alot! So I was just wondering when i should wake her up.)      My baby girl is still awake, not falling asleep - which is extremely odd for her! Usually I'll feed her and she'll fall asleep within 30 mins to an hour afterward. Its been an hour and a half and she is still WIDE awake.      I know I have nothing to worry about, but I'm new at this and I am worried. So since she hasn't fallen asleep yet and its now 8:15 - I started feeding her before at 6:15. I don't want her to fall asleep for like 5 minutes then I have to wake her up to feed her (I will, I'll just feel bad).      MAN! Lame questions I know, I'm just trying to do this as correctly as I can!      Thanks again everyone!

20090222183316AAWCD70	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do so many teenagers claim that they want to die?	Really, I find it sad and even disguisting.   So many times I've seen things like   "I'm always arguing with my family - I want to die!"   "I'm failing school - I want to die!"   "I broke up with my boyfriend/girlfriend - I want to die!"      No....No you don't want to die.   Do you know how scary the idea of dying is once you are actually phased with the possibility that you really might die?   It's terrifying, and it makes me sick that so many other teenagers - mainly girls - think it's ok to think like this. I am a teenage girl myself, so no bias here...      If you have a problem, fix it.   Don't kill yourself because your mother yelled at you or because your father took away your cell phone.      What is the meaning behind this?   Why did this idea of dying become fanatical, anyway?

I'm not talking about people who gets laid off, can't find a job, getting assistance to supplement their incomes, or has any type of special circumstances. I'm kinda irritated because I'm stuck at work this whole weekend while my baby is sick at home with her daddy. Someone on here actually asked a question whether she should return to work from maternity leave when she can be a SAHM on govt assistance. She said why do people even work.  I thought the whole SAHM thing is when your husband makes enough money to allow you to stay at home not you stay at home while everyone works and you get a chunk of their money when they pay taxes. It just seem so unfair.

Here are my reasons why Im considering calling him EVEN though he did not directly give me his number:      1) We graduated in 08 so we did not have a chance to say how we felt..       2) I am 99 percent certain that at the time he liked me,      3) he would always stare at me, he would ditch other girls if he saw me coming by him, he would take time out of his own lunch to stand there by himself in the SAME area me and my friends were at..       4) he ditched his friends so he could be close to me.. he didnt exacally talk to me because my friend was there      5) He followed me home one time, I also saw a car that looked like his by my driveway and the doorbell rang ( i did not answer it though cause i didnt know what to say if it were to be him)      okay so those are my reasons.. i dunno if there good enough but after seeing him in a crowded area and we locked eyes he looked very sad cause we are not together i think.. so im considering calling him now..      I cant picture him with another girl but me.. me and him were ment to be.. its just i dont know what im going to say to him on the phone so its not akward.. the thing i think he might be creepd out about is the fact that i never had the gets to be so forward with him when he was making an effor to talk to me now all of a sudden im callign him trying to talk to him?? i dont want him to question me.. but im guessing he most likely will..       how should i go about this? and do you think i should go for it?

20090222190511AAFBe2l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	This is for all of you, pro-adoption and anti-adoption.?	I am going to be doing a presentation in a Womens studies class and I want to do it on why adoption is not an ethically "better" alternative to abortion.  I am pro-choice, all around.  I do believe that adoption is only beneficial to the adoptive parents.        Anyway, what I want is all the information you have on adoption, especially links of studies done that link psychological issues with adoption (of all three parts of the triad).      I hope this makes sense, and thanks!
20090222190657AAIHf5X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	2-yr old suddenly is afraid to poop...?	My daughter is 2 yrs old, and is potty trained at least fr a year. A week ago she suddenly stopped pooping in the potty. It looks to me that when she has an urge she tries to keep it, an totally refuses sit on the potty (she goes pee to the potty though). We analyzed the problem and came to a conclusion that she had a hard stool one day and it hurt her during potty, so now she is either afraid or has discomfort while pooping. When she can't keep it anymore she poops in the pants, or sometimes asks for diaper and poops in the diaper. My mother-in-law (she takes care of her for almost a year now) managed to get my daughter to poop in the potty a couple of times (playing with her and distracting her, I haven't seen it though). I don't know what to do now, should I go to a doctor to see if my daughter damaged something while pushing hard (what would be the symptoms of that?) or it's just a fear? Anybody who had such experience with their kids, what did you do? If there are any medical professionals, please share your opinion!      Thanks a lot!

I'm curious to know because this month I had a little scare thinking I may be pregnant since I had "missed" my period. It did end up coming but 5 days late and it didn't seem normal, it wasn't light but normally it is much heavier, and no cramps at all when usually I have terrible cramps. I feel like I'm having pregnancy symptoms such as sore breasts and nausea and now my period is over. Any information you have will help...thnx :]

20090222202923AAN2jAo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does your weight affect your ability to feel those first baby movements?	I'm 18 weeks pregnant with baby #2. I heard that you were supposed to feel movement sooner with your second pregnancy. I remember with my first pregnancy I felt those first flutters at around 16-17 weeks and I really haven't felt anything yet with this one. But, I gained a lot of weight with baby #1 (60 lbs) and only lost 20 lbs of it before I got pregnant with baby #2. So could carrying that extra weight cause me to not feel those movement sooner?

I'm gonna try out for a softball team tomorrow that has already been together for like 2 weeks but I quit the sport I originally got. It's 7th-12th grade and the coach says some of them are pretty good. I played baseball from 3rd-4th grade and softball in 5th. I was like the second or third best on the team behind the coach's son(s). I'm in 7th grade and I'm gonna be the only 7th grader if I make it. It's a school team and I go to private school but the kids are still really bratty. I know only one 8th grade girl who seems nice.I'm sooo nervous! Like what if I don't do good and I go out there and embarrass myself in front of al of the other girls? Cause I quit one sport because I didn't have endurance for it (it was track)!

So for about a month my son has been pooping more than normal... and for the past 3 days it's been way more than normal.. it's not diarrhea, but the only just wet diaper I change is in the morning now, every diaper for the rest of the day is dirty. He is now on whole milk, but seemed to be doing good with it at first, that's the only change he has had in his diet... I've limited his juice to once a day, and bought the kind with limited sugar thinking that might be the problem but it still hasn't fixed it... he goes to the doctor in 2 days for his vaccines, but I was just wondering what you guys thought of this? Could he have an allergy to milk a month after starting it? His pooping did increase with the milk, but not as bad as it's been this week. Any advice or thoughts would be really appreciated!

Teens with cell phones and teens having cell phones in school is a huge debate and I already know on here that people will be divided when it comes to this.    But and know this doesn't happen often but what if there were a school shooting or more common what if there was a natural disaster?      My question is    Would you rather let your teen have a cell phone and text get an "i love you" if there were an emergency or would you not give them one and chance a disaster happening and never getting that last message?      I know teens go overboard and text in class but the world is crazy today and you never know what could happen.      "Live for today because yesterday is gone and tomorrow may never come."

I am starting to feel like it's impossible for me to have babies, and it's killing me!!      My period cycles are very irregular.  Sometimes I get it for a few months straight, then other times it skips months at a time.  Irregular periods run in my family, and every other woman that has them in my family has 2+ kids.  WHY NOT ME?!?!?!  Every time I go to the store and see baby stuff I start crying!  Everytime I receive an invite to a baby shower I can't help but cry!  I am just so sad and tired of waiting.  All I want is to be pregnant with a healthy little baby!!!  I can't go to the doctor just yet because my hubby just switched to a better and higher paying job and his new insurance hasn't started yet (it starts in 2 months).      Anyway, I was wondering how long it took some other ladies to conceive.  Maybe there is a woman out there that went through the same thing as I am, and ended up with babies (naturally, not with IVF or anything).  I'm just looking for some hope and maybe a little Baby Dust!      Good luck to the rest of the women TTC out there, believe me I know how you feel.  Congrats to the women who have babies!!!

I've read the books and I know about different children dealing in various ways with change and all... but nothing the books recommend seem to work.   We do connect when we play. But the result of that is it becomes more of a "him seeing me as a big brother figure"... which is fine.

The wife's concerned cuz she thinks I don't like him.    Oh, something you should also know; wife's set to have our first daughter middle march. I've read the books and I know about different children dealing in various ways with change and all... but nothing the books recommend seem to work.   We do connect when we play. But the result of that is it becomes more of a "him seeing me as a big brother figure"... which is fine. Until I say something and he ignores me, cuz he sees me as the big brother instead of parental figure.   Understand the spot I'm in?      I'm at my wit's end and I don't know how to make this better.   Please help!

I think I just had a brilliant idea, and I would like other mothers' ideas if this has worked for them at all.      I think I might get a copy of my house key made for my 2 1/2 year old son, and put it on a key chain with two or three skeleton keys added to it. It would serve as a toy for them to play with in public, and also a safety house key included in case they are left with "grandma and grandpa's" and they need to get into our house.      Has anyone done this, and what do they think?

20090222204019AAVBBLj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Had some bp issues and feel weird, should I go to the ER?	So I've been resting all weekend. It was like 135/88 and my midwife told me to rest and I have a URI and ear infection she said to let the antibiotics kick in and just rest until I get better. I was at my mamas because my hubby wants to paint before the baby gets here and get all the dust and allergens down but my mom is a hypochondriac who kept telling me to go to the ER.. I finally gave in and let her take me to the fire dept for a quick bp check. It did go up to 158/94 and then she really really wanted me to go to the ER but I felt fine and called my midwife and she said to just come in for a quick check. Then she checks it and it's 128/78! Way way better actually she tells me to keep laying down until I get better but I'm all happy because I already feel better pretty much and when I got back home I look at my fresh painted bedroom and nursery and start putting crap together and decorating. Took me a bath and sit down--- Now I really feel like complete crap!!! Like, maybe I overdid it and need to go to the ER. My heart is pounding. okay I don't know that I should because it was much better earlier. I maybe just scared because my Mom freaked me out talking about having a heart attack and seizures but I do feel like crap.

20090222203021AA43VPA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why am I being called a "bad" mom for giving my son formula over breast milk?	My little boy was born early. I had depression. I took meds to help with the depression. I didn't find out I have celiac disease until he was 16 months old. I was told today that I'm a bad mom, because I should have stopped taking my meds, and breast fed my son. I didn't think it was in his best interest at the time to do so. I'm glad that he didn't get breast milk, it wouldn't have been nutritionally complete, because I had a HUGE nutritionally deficiency!       I know I'm a good mom. My son is doing really well, and is extremely intelligent. I told that  ***** that I couldn't breast feed my son. I was taking meds to help me.  I was then told I was selfish for thinking of myself first over the health and well being of my son. Well I'm sorry. I had depression. I didn't want my little boy to drink breast milk with anti-depressants. If that constitutes being a bad mom then so be it! I has ALWAYS had this motto: "Happy Mom=Happy Baby".       How many of you think like that ***** was way out of line?

20090222194415AA9LE9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What's going on with my period?!?	Something weird is going on. My period has always been exactly on time, same day, same time, same amount of blood etc. Last time it was two weeks late, and I had abdominal cramping for 3weeks beforehand, but a pregnancy test turned out negative. I assumed it was just a 1off, but about 6days ago I started getting really dark brown blood like last day of period in my knickers, but only a wee bit, and every day there has been more if it. Two days ago it started going red like normal, and has had lots of clots or what appears to be uterus lining in it, more than I ever get with my period. I can't get in to Family Planning for another 3weeks, and don't want to see my elderly male doctor about it, but I don't know what's going on.      I wondered if I'd been pregnant last time but miscarried, but why is all this weird stuff going on now, unless maybe I have gotten pregnant since last time and this is spotting, but why is there clotty stuff in the blood? My husband and I have been trying for a baby, and my friend reckons that having sex more often has maybe just screwed with my hormones, but I think it's more than that. Can anybody shed some light on this for me?! I'm quite worried and really confused!

We only ever had 1 name picked for a boy and 1 for a girl. My aunty recently had a baby girl and used the name we had chosen for a girl (Charlotte).

It's not just the first name we have picked- the middle name is going to be my mothers name and it all fits so well together. We have had this name picked for 4 years- it is hard to think about changing it.   I have asked a few people this question and they have said they think we could still use it as we have different surnames and do not see them that often.

20090222192226AAQMGEe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible I could be pregnant?	My husband and I went on vacation down south during the week of Feb 7-14th I started my period on the 6th of Feb.  Because I have a short menstrual cycle we had unprotected sex the whole week.  Now since we have been home I have been feeling nauseous, my boobs are sore, I am getting more headaches then usual, tons of gas, and I have been feeling period like cramping.  I know you must be ovulating in order to get pregnant and that typically happens 14 days or so after your period begins...but could it be possible that I am?? Is it too soon to be feeling pregnancy symptoms already?

"Shall I go, Armand?" she asked in tones sharp with agonized suspense.  ""Do you want me to go?"  "Yes, I want you to go" . Desiree takes her child and leaves and she was never seen again.   Armand burns all of her belongings and then he finds a letter from his mother saying that he was the one that carried the black gene, because his father was black.  “Moreover [Armand] no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name" . Armand wasn’t even aware of his own race when he acted like that.  He ended up losing his wife and his baby all because he was racist and couldn’t live to that fact that Desiree could have been black.        can someone help me edit this esssay

(Yes, I know...world's worst mother..formula is poison...I've heard it all before)      Anyway, that was all 5 months ago, and just recently, my doctor prescribed me Domperidone, in the form of motilium..for nausea related issues, and I've been reading that it is a drug used to try and increase breast milk (OR maybe I am mistaken, I'm not sure!)      My breasts have been leaking a little, and feeling a little more fuller than usual.      Are these related??      I think I'd give everyone personally a hi-five (if it were possible!) if I managed to not receive a single negative remark about the formula!

I was going to have the shower at the Lake Selmac (the local lake). I choose this place because my father's mother and sisters don't get along with the baby's dad's aunt (its a long story). So I wanted to do it someplace Natural but now that's its going to be moved up I'm afraid that its going to rain and that it will all be ruined. My aunt (my mother sister's who has no problems with the baby's dad aunt) has offered her house. She has parking, space, and I wouldn't have to rent tables and chairs.       I don't want the feuding people to be pissed because I didn't ask if I could do it at there house. So what should I do....       I'm sorry this is long....

Sleep has been an issue with my son from day one, first he had his days and nights mixed up, then he slept thru the night for about a week...then he got his 2 month shots and started waking up at night consistantly again. when he was about 8 mos old we had it and let him start the "cry out" method we let him cry for about 20 mins before going in and it usually only took about 7 mins after a week of that he was sleeping throught the night for about two weeks....THEN he started cutting more teeth and he hasn't slept through the night since. Now he is 10 mos old and is waking between 3 and 5 times per night and the "cry out" method no longer works because he pulls up on his crib now and since he is standing he is fully awake and just crys until he has worked himself almost frantic. Also food is not the issue he gets PLENTY during the day and gets a late evening snack about 7:45 a bottle at 8-8:15 and is asleep by 8:30, he gets good naps during the day, and I have also tried putting him in bed with me and it makes no difference in the wakings.       Please help anyone who has ANY advice or has gone through this themselves would be helpful...I am SO tired!!!
20090222211604AApG1U9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Wat is my baby telling me?	I recently got a positive test result at my doctors!! Im very excited! I had some brownish red bleeding for a couple days and she sent me to my OBGYN- He gave me a Trans vaginal ultra-sound but there was no embryo? So later that day i got blood work done to to see my HCG levels then 2 days later i had my blood HCG taken again. That day i went to the ER because of gall stones (gall bladder disease) and i actually started to bleed a bit dark reddish blood kind of thick.. not heavy though (and yes ive been monitoring with a pad) some very tiny almost un recognizable blood clots too. but no cramping. So he took a look and said that it was a threaten miscarriage (and ive had one b4 but it was much quicker found out one day next it was gone) So the next day i got another trans vaginal done to rule out tubular or ectopic.. and once again nothing appeared. Im starting to get nervous but on the good side he told me my hormone levels are high and rising :) but im so confused on what to think. he also said if it was a miscarriage he's see it by now. so he thinks its either too early or a belightned ovum? ugg.., i dont know. now i have to wait 3 days to see wats going on.. and my bleeding has seemed to be reducing

20090222215849AA0vLJB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Someone please help me with this relationship problem! I love my husband but I dont know what to do!!?	This is the story. My husband and I have been together since I was a preteen. I am now in my twenties (early 20's). In those beginning years up to about I was 18 we had a best friend. He was mainly my best friend. Lately, I have been stuck on wondering what would have happend between me and the best friend had I notbeen with my husband. My husband is an amazing guy, and I honestly don't believe there is a better man out there. He's never done anything to hurt me at all. When Im upset or anything he's always there. We found out we were going to be paretns when I turned 17, and he's payed for everything while I finished school, and honestly has been the best man a woman could ask for. I want to be good for him, and I want to be the wife he deserves, but I just can't help but wonder and sometimes I go see the guy (nothing ever happens, and my husband knows. He just trust me.) The guy knows how I feel and he feels the same way. I feel so guilty because my husband is such a good guy, and I would die if I ever lost him. I'm just so stuck because I told the guy I had to stop talking to him because I couldnt do this to my husband,and then I missed him for weeks and weeks till I finally gave in and started talking to him again. Now, I want to stop talking to him, but his father wasjust in a horrible incident, and I dont want him to feel alone. I'm just so confused. Also, the best friend doesn't compare to my husabdn in no way. I just can't leave him alone, and I don't know why. Please somebody help me and tell me what I need to do. I have prayed to God for the strength to let him go, and I know it may take time, but the guilt is overwhelming and Im just so lost. Please help

20090222211631AAaOWyP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	HELP! I feel like a fool and need to know if this is normal!?	Ok so I've never done this before - and I feel like a bit of a dill asking silly questions, but I have to get opinions of others, as I have no idea what to make of this...   I did IVF for 12 months in 2007/08, and stopped in Feb '08 due to not being able to cope with the stress of it. Originally I started IVF because I wasn't ovulating due to POS and Endo. Since I stopped, however, I have started ovulating naturally, and my cycles have ran like clockwork every month.   I have just worked out that I am now 2 weeks overdue in this cycle. I have cramping, bloating and slightly lumpy breasts, and a sore lower back - all of which are normally symptoms of getting my monthly visitor. The only difference is that I also have a rather thick, white discharge, experiencing some dizziness, constipation and of course - no period. I tired a home preg test, however it said negative. Is it too early to get a positive test???   I'm not looking for a diagnosis, but does anyone have any advice they can give me? Is this normal? I feel like a fool for asking such simple questions, and nobody will be able to give me a definitive answer, but has this ever happened to anyone else? Just looking for a friendly ear, really...
