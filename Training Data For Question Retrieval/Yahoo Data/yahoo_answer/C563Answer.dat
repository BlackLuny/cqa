AJuBA9Ckaa	Your body naturally burns between 2000 and 3000 calories per day (depending on your metabolism) without any exercising. Your exercising burns an EXTRA 600 calories per day. When you exercise you raise your metabolism so even when your not exercising you will burn calories.|`|eKL7xSeLaa	well, over the course of the day your biological needs take up a lot of calories.|`|AA10671705	1200 is the minimum you need.  When you have less than that, your body goes in to starvation mode and starts shutting down to conserve energy.  You may only burn 600 calories exercising, but you burn calories 24/7 regardless.

QGd6yco6aa	You can't handle a pregnancy at 15. I know you say you can... but really, you can't. And- You won't want to give your baby up, since he/she is YOURS. Not to mention, you can't use your sister as a baby dumpster. That sounds terrible, but using her as an excuse to throw your youth away... it doesn't flow.<br>  <br>  I know you're young, but really... the sex can wait a while. If this REALLY is not stupid teen love, you won't mind waiting. Since you have the rest of your life. <br>  <br>  A baby costs you AT LEAST $1,000 A MONTH. You can't pay for that working part-time at minimum wage, and since you're 15, I doubt you have a job.<br>  <br>  You would have to drop out of school to care for your baby since he/she is YOURS, therefore YOUR responsibility. It's not a puppy that your mother or father can watch while you're at school, or out partying.<br>  <br>  Yes- partying. Kiss it good-bye. 16..17...18...19...20...21..22...23... Best ages. You'll skip them and go right to 30 before you're ready!<br>  <br>  Not to mention, at 15, your body isn't developed enough to carry a baby. It could be harmful for both of you.<br>  <br>  AS FOR THE SEX:<br>  It will hurt.<br>  You will bleed.<br>  As for telling the parents... you just say "Mom, Dad... It's a good thing you don't have a gun because I did something I thought would be fun... and well... congrats grammy, congrats pop-pop!"<br>  <br>  And every teenager thinks they are more mature than they are not.<br>  <br>  I don't wanna be the one to say what you don't wanna hear, but its all true.

THp5odSDaa	It depends on what kind of zits you have.<br>  If it is surface blemishes, like blackheads and white heads.  Steam your face and cleanse thoroughly using a good quality cleanser like those found at www.paulaschoice.com  If you have a lot of blemishes you most likely have oily skin so use a gel cleanser. Also use a BHA exfoliator and a benzoyl peroxide product to kill the bacteria that causes break outs.  All of this can be found within the Paula's choice product line.<br>  If your blemishes are deeper and more of a boil type blemish you will need to do internal cleanse along with the topical skin care.

This may be your genetic makeup and you can't change that.  If your a pretzel, be the best pretzel you can be.  If an apple, be the best apple you can be.  You don't need to add fat to your diet if you eat out or anything processed, you are getting enough.  You need to add more calories (maybe) but they should be GOOD calories - lot of vegetables, lean meat, fruit.

Drink lot of water and sleep well ( at least 7 hours daily).|`|AA11690464	That slows down your metabolism, and your body hangs on to every ounce of fat on your body.  Eat several small healthy meals throughout the day.|`|AA11783561	Actually, eating more often, small portions promotes increase in metabolism. Longer between slows it down.|`|AA12206399	Katia, yes you will lose weight on this plan, but there are some drawbacks to your plan:<br>  <br>  1) MIneral / vitamin deprivation. You simply aren't consuming enough food to supply your body it's nutrients.<br>  <br>  2) You are losing muscle -- the thing that helps you burn more calories.  The reason for this is that you are starving yourself, so your body starts to catabolize fats as well as muscles to feed itself.  So if you do succeed in your diet, you'll look gaunt and deprived, not fit.  <br>  <br>  3) How long can you continue this?  Let's say you drop to your goal weight... then what?  Can you see yourself carrying this plan out for the next year, 2 years? You aren't teaching yourself moderation and a sensible diet plan.  You'll probably regain the weight and then have to go on another starvation type of diet to lose it all over again -- and this time your metabolism will be even slower.<br>  <br>  4) Your energy levels probably decline at noon-ish.  You might experience some mood swings and general crabbiness. This isn't good.  A steady supply of nutrients will keep your insulin in check and allow you to function at your best throughout the day.<br>  <br>  I'd like to see you eat 4 - 6 small meals a day.  Say 300 calories a piece (or a total of 1500 - 1800 calories a day). That way you keep your metabolism going, you'll lose weight because you'll be consuming less calories than you burn, and you'll find it easier to maintain this diet for a lifetime.  If possible, find ways to be active (go for walks, hit the gym, etc).  Also, take a multivitamin with minerals to prevent deficiencies.<br>  <br>  The weight loss won't happen over night, but I think you'll be happier in the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7ada99b0fa9ca4cad75c7f8e26a95bd7aa	Well, yes.  But you will gain more when you resume eating.  Your body thinks it is starving when you initiate a diet like yours, and slows down you metabolism.  When you begin eating again your body will begin storing fat very quickly in case it "starves" again.  You actually need to eat more in order to lose weight.  You didn't want diet tips, but I will offer them any way.  Eat plenty of protein with a mix of carbs and veggies.  Keep all portions to what can fit in the palm of your hand.  Also eat four meals a day, and do light exercise three times a week.  Keep your workouts to about 30mins to start with and move up when you are ready.  Trust me, YOU WILL LOSE WEIGHT ON THIS PLAN.  And the great part is that it will stay off, even if you slip a little.  So don't starve yourself; you will only gain more weight in the long-run.  Why do you think there are so many diets out there?  Because all of the others have failed.  Feel free to send me a message if you want any meal tips.  I'm full of them.  Simple, yummy, and healthy.  Good luck to you.|`|AA10255807	think you actually need to eat a couple of more meals a day.  Add a peice of fruit at about 8-9am.  A good lunch, peice of fish or chicken, some vegetables 12-1pm.  Handful of Nuts at 3-4pm.  Tou get the picture. You'll be taking in less calories your way, but will be decreasing your metabolism.  If there is nothing to digest your body won't.  Plus you'll be running on fumes all day and are probably tired.  Why not thrown in some situps or push ups for 5 minutes a day.  You'll find that you probably have time for 15-30 minutes of excercise.|`|AA10438075	absolutely not, but since youaked for no diet plans i won't give you my opinion. too bad!|`|AA11784699	You will not lose any weight doin that. You gonna go into starvation mode and your body is goin to store fat. You should eat small meals all day long. It will speed up your metabolisom. I would eat 6 little meals a day ,with moderate excersize, and i went from 160 to 125 pounds. I continued to eats carbs and dairy but i cut out most sugars. This way you can still eat anything you want.|`|e46c4dec6285cff617ca5cf1d6249165aa	It sounds like you're headed in the right direction, congrats to you for trying to lose weight by eating healthy food instead of depending on pills to do it.  But.....oh, come on, you knew there would be a but.....you would be so much better off sticking to that KIND of diet but bumping up the number of times per day that you eat.  Stick with the kind of food you've already incorporated into your diet but instead of only eating once or twice a day try eating like 5 or 6 times daily.  By eating more frequently you will speed up your metabolism therefore burning more calories even when you're not exercising.  I tried the eating once a day diet and sure, I lost a few pounds but I felt like crap all the time, then I found out that I was making myself sick so my doctor gave me this eating 6 times a day diet which was, honestly, really hard to follow but totally worth it.  I lost more weight in a shorter amount of time and actually had energy to spare.  Give it a try, good luck and keep up the hard work.

Otherwise, you'll get no benifit from it and it may actually be detrimental, as excess calories will be converted to fat.|`|439f9961aaf08a80871ccafbb4cdcffcaa	Yes -- as long as you're putting in the necessary effort to cause your muscles to need the protein for building size and strength.|`|47cb72348217a23e95b20db38d9cb65faa	Upon analysis of a single pound of human muscle tissue, you'll see that muscle is 70% water, while only being composed of 22% protein.  The remainder is composed of lipids (6%) and inorganic materials (2%).  It also contains 600 calories.  These are established medical facts--not just some made-up figures from a self-styled Yahoo advice expert.  So, realizing that a gram of protein contains 4 calories, some quick math will show you that a pound of human muscle tissue contains 33 grams of protein.  Since most athletes are doing quite well if they gain ten pounds of lean weight per year, if they WERE to gain those ten pounds, they'd need only 330 extra grams of protein PER YEAR to make it happen.  Not per day.  Not per week.  PER YEAR.  And since fat contains 3500 calories per pound--verses muscle's 600 per pound--it becomes obvious that consuming monsterous amounts of calories (the so-called "bulking up" phase) won't get you any closer to your goals, either.<br>  <br>  Your growth must be triggered by your training program, followed by enough rest that the body can recover from it, and then overcompensate by way of increasing strength and size.  Without the proper trigger, no adaptation will occur.  Too much training, and you'll never get the opportunity to grow--in fact, you'll hold yourself back.<br>  <br>  Nutrients are dirt cheap to produce, and empty promises are free... yet supplements are expensive.  Simple marketing.  And when you don't see the results you expect... there's suddenly a new and improved formula for you to buy and try.  The simple fact is that no one--regardless of activity--requires more than a balanced diet to gain all required nutrients.  The Food and Drug Administration recommends .80 grams of protein per kilo (2.2lbs) of bodyweight--and that's on the high side!  (They once recommended only a half a gram per kilo.)  That's regardless of activity level.  That's also not what Twin Lab wants you to believe.

Working on your legs in general makes the muscles bigger. So whatever exercise routine you're doing now, add more reps to it. You can try holding heavy weights while you're squatting to put more weight while you're working on your legs. Do as many jumping jacks as you can also.<br>  <br>  As far as eating goes, I do not reccomend just eating a bunch of fatty foods. You should work on eating a lot of whole grain foods and protein. Theres nothing wrong with carbs but just make sure it's good carbs. Anytime you consume a lot of calories just make sure they're good ones.<br>  <br>  Don't start eating mcdonalds every day. You're just gonna end up fat and sloppy. and you don't want that I'm pretty sure. All that type of food is going to end up on your stomache, arms, and anywhere else you don't want it to go.<br>  <br>  Another thing, if you want your hips, ***, and thighs (basically your lower part of your body) to stand out the most make sure you're waist is small. Because when you have a larger stomache and waist it's hard to take notice to the rest of your body and it won't stand out as much. So if you need to do a little more sit-ups and start doing cardio a bit. Then by all means do so. However if you're stomach is already flat then you're already off to a good start.<br>  <br>  take care & Good luck<br>  :)|`|AA10489318	Do not bother about thighs as the thighs will automatically swell after a few years.

6c73d6ae0da43c4e77bf5e20d8bbbba9aa	Unfortunately, no one can 'exactly' predict how you will feel on anti-depressants until you try them out for yourself. There are a good 30+ anti-depressants out there, all are different drugs, all will affect you differently, and all will have different effects on you depending on the dose. Most importantly, as we are all different people, an anti-depressant that works marvelously for one person may not work at all for another person. <br>  <br>  As such, you should be well aware in advance that there's a good chance that the first anti-depressant you are perscribed may not acutally work for you, and that you may have try various anti-depressants until you find one that actually has desirable effects for you. <br>  <br>  As a generalized rule, if an anti-depressant IS working the way its supposed to, you will basically experience an emotional numbness. Yes, you will still get sad or depressed, but it won't be as intense it used to be as it was before you were on medications. You will likely find yourself caring a bit less about the problems that plague you in your daily life. <br>  <br>  While antidepressants may take some of the worst depths of your misery out of your life, the fact is that they will probably not make you 'happy.' Getting a nice euphoria going on an anti-depressant is probably theoretically possible, especially if you are bipolar, but seriously, its not bloody likely. Doctors hand out perscriptions for anti-depressants as if they are candy, and trust me, if you could easily have 'fun' on them, they would be a lot harder to get a script for.<br>  <br>  Conversely, if you take anti-depressants and they're NOT working - well, anything can happen, basically. Intense anger, bizarre mood swings, increased depression, and severe anxiety, all of which are common after taking an anti-depressant that doesn't click with you, and I can vouch that I've personally experienced all of them. As you may already know, the suicide rate/risk actually goes UP once a person takes anti-depressants, which is one of the main reasons most anti-depressants aren't supposed to be perscribed to anyone under 18. <br>  <br>  There is again a third possibility: an antidpressant may not affect your mood at all; that is to say, your emotional/mental state may remain the same as it is now, with no perceptible differences. <br>  <br>  At any rate, no matter what the effects on your mood are, expect to experience some side effects. The range of possible side effects are very diverse, and again, all depend on the drug and dosage. <br>  <br>  Most commonly, your sleep may be affected. Some antidepressants (e.g. Remeron or Trazodone) will make you drowsy and sleepy and will basically act as a sleeping pill, whereas other drugs such as Wellbutrin will give you lots of energy and possibly keep you up all night. Other drugs, such as SSRIs, can swing either way when it comes to your ability to sleep. Likewise, there's a good chance your appetite will be affected; some antidepressants will increase your appetite to the point where you're constantly stuffing your face, whereas others will kill your appetite to the point where you're eating almost nothing. Weight gain and loss are both common. Many antidepressants are supposed to double as anti-anxiety drugs, so if you suffer from anxiety and if you're one of the lucky ones, your anxiety may decrease. <br>  <br>  I would recommend that you go ahead and check out crazymeds.org and read up on all the different antidepressants, just to get a feel of which medications you think may be beneficial to YOU, and then when you have a base of knowledge, go ahead and discuss it with your doctor. <br>  <br>  Please ignore that guy above me who basically recommended that you take Effexor; Effexor is a really addictive anti-depressant that is well known for its particularly brutal withdrawal symptoms (electric head shocks, hallucinations). A lot of people who are perscribed Effexor by their doctors simply don't know what they are getting into when they start taking it, and are devastated when they attempt to get off it. While Effexor may just be the thing for you, I hope that you are aware of the other anti-depressant options available to you beforehand.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|725a1afe20501d6736e8f786b56ff022aa	They "take the edge off" of your anxiety and depression.

Just less depressed, less preoccupied with my pain.|`|439f9961aaf08a80871ccafbb4cdcffcaa	The source of many types of depression is a chemical imbalance in your brain -- more specifically, a neurotransmitter called serotonin is not as effective as it should be because it is reabsorbed by nerve cells too fast to let it do its job.<br>  <br>  Most anti-depressants act on the brain by slowing down the reabsorbtion (this is sometimes called "re-uptake) of serotonin, thus letting the messages between nerve cells get through as they should.<br>  <br>  Prozac, Zoloft, and other SSRI's ("selective serontonin re-uptake inhibitors") won't necessarily make you happy -- but they will help you stop feeling so sad.|`|AA11972105	I agree with "Drugrep" and "White Trash" the just relax you, they take the "Anxiousness' away, I was on some for a while but really didnt do me any good. Doctors are to quick to put people on anti-depressants today, I look at it this way, if you won $1 million today you probably would feel better straight away hey? I know I would, everyone is depressed one way or another, some just more than others and if you dont have enough money and ur job sucks or u havnt got one, bills are mounting up, personal problems etc you will be depressed, thats life!! I find just getting out and going for a walk every day and trying to think happy makes you slowly get better, I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks so for that I take the odd Valium, that just takes the edge off. People tell me Valium is no good etc, but 5mg ady wont kill me and it helps me, so do a few drinks. If I listened to all the doctors I went to I would be taking 100 pills a day. lol. Not for me, try doing it yourself, I found deep breathing excersises also help, but most of all get out and move, walk, look at beautiful things and keep yourself busy, it all helps. People always say money wont make you happy, I say crap!!! If i won lotto it would make me happy and I honestly think that it has alot to do with it, because without money you cant pay the bills or eat properly and you get even more depressed when you see all these rich people driving around in their Porsches throwing money around like its nothing. Depression is you not being happy, so if you were happy you probably wouldnt be depressed, and I bet if you won lotto you would be happy. So dont take to many drugs they really dont work, look up the side effects of some of those anti-depessants, they actually can make you depressed, its ridiculous, they can cause blurred vision, high blood pressure, body aches, liver desease, kidney problems etc etc check it out for yourself I have, that made me more depressed. So be kool, and go for a walk, keep busy, and be happy, only you can help urself, be strong, tell ur brain to take control, Peace....|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	Doctors think nothing of handing out prescriptions for anti-depressants.   These drugs are very popular as being the easy fix.   But they aren't without side effects.  Just check out some of the ones listed.   I hope that if you do have to use medication, that it will be a last resort.    Do your homework and research alternative methods to treat your depression and anxiety and really give it effort and a chance to work before agreeing to be put on anti-depressants.
23c4fc74ea981c37c08d02367ca82fe0aa	Absolutely enough time.  You will need to train your lungs to make sure you can breath hard for 15 minutes - start working out cardio, use a bike or jog at your own pace but get the heart and lungs going, if you only make it 10 minutes, then rest a bit (like 10 minutes of walking) and go again - no need to work out more than an hour a day, every other day.  but your heart and lungs have to get used to working for you.  Once you've tested them, measure your pace on a track so you know about how fast 2:30 seconds is for a quarter mile.  Beyond that, drink plenty of water the day before, but very little when you're within 1-2 hours of testing, it'll mess with your stomach.  Same theory in your workout, never gulp a bunch of water then run, take it in a little at a time.  Best of luck to you!|`|AA11094855	you should be able to walk a mile in less time than that.|`|439f9961aaf08a80871ccafbb4cdcffcaa	This depends upon your current physical condition, but if you're in good health, yes -- you can do it.   Think of it this way:  if you *walk* at 3 mph, you could cover a mile in 20 minutes.  To make it in just over half that time, you need to achieve an average speed of about just over 5 mph.  If you have access to treadmill, set it to 5 mph to see what that kind of pace is like -- it's certainly faster than a walk, but not much more than a jog.  Remember that marathon runners can average *5* minutes miles for 26 miles in a row!   Four weeks should be plenty of time -- again, assuming your health is good! <br>  <br>  Also, your strategy is fine.|`|11f129d19665b910f107cdcf4f78f372aa	Yes its possible. I had to do it  as a kid in high school. I made it in 8:30 jogging.

You have just enough time to whip yourself into shape. Running a mile in under 11 min. is easy, so don't panic. It will take discipline, but as long as you follow through you WILL make it!  ANYBODY that trains consistently for 4 weeks should be able to clear a mile in less that 11 min. Be careful not to panic and end up overtraining though- a bad case of shin splints can ruin everything for you or at the very best make your army test sheer hell. <br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  1.) Start out week 1 running 1 day on, 2 days off.<br>  2.) Week 2-4 every-other day. Taking a rest day in between is important. If at anytime you feel sore anywhere from running, especially in the shin/ankle area, take an extra day of rest to recover. <br>  3.) Try to run as long as you can without stopping. Start by setting little mini-goals for yourself. (ex. run 1 lap, walk the 2nd...progressing to run on the long part, walk on the curve...ect.) Gradually progressing yourself to jogging the entire time. By the end of week 2, you should be able to run a mile without stopping

439f9961aaf08a80871ccafbb4cdcffcaa	Modern X-ray machines use very little power, and the techs who run them are trained to use the minimum amount of radiation necessary to obtain the needed result.  <br>  <br>  A typical chest X-ray exposes you to about 0.1 mSv (milliSieverts, a measure of the effective dose from ionizing radiation like X-rays). By way of comparision, all of us receive a dose of about 3 mSv every year just from naturally occurring background radiation (even more than that if we fly a lot or live in Colorado or New Mexico). <br>  <br>  The dose from a single chest X-ray is the same as what you would get just from the environment in about 10 days.<br>  <br>  Ultrasound does not involve radiation at all -- it uses sound waves to produce images.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've had a lot of diagnostic imaging, but you really don't have much to worry about.

Secondly an Angiogram is a passive test that uses no radiation at all. Now as for x-rays, many people believe that because x-rays can pass through tissue that they are bad, and alot of x-rays will kill, however medical x-rays are not CUMULATIVE. What that means is that the effect of medical x-rays will not add to cause a problem. Unless you had an x-ray machine that was hooked up directly to a nuclear reactor there will not have been enough power in the x-rays to cause damage. It would take over 100 medical x-rays taken in quick succession on one part of the body to cause lasing damage.

Maybe you have some new twists on thing to be stressed about; just as like a good group well be instantly empathetic and have 4 ideas you can try.  Friends who dont want things from you can be great source of comfort just from the sheer ordinariness of the discussions and interactions.

One style may shave certain faces more closely (or more comfortably) than the other style.   Both work quite well for me.  The Norelco brand tends to have the circles, and Remington, Panasonic and Braun to tend to be flat.  I've used all three, and currently have a Braun (don't remember the model number/name) -- the kind that has the self-cleaning base.  It works great for me.

Plus if you're thinking about lowering your weight - and your "eating clean" is a great first step. Add these 10 foods to your grocery cart and you'll get three terrific benefits: <br>  1. Lots of super-healthy liquids to flush out the body while pouring in nutrients. <br>  2. Fiber to keep your GI tract fit.<br>  3. Foods that energize cleansing enzymes in the liver, your body's built-in detox center. <br>  The top 10:<br>  Green leafy vegetables. Eat them raw, throw them into a broth, add them to juices. Their chlorophyll helps swab out environmental toxins (heavy metals, pesticides) and is an all-round liver protector. <br>  Lemons. You need to keep the fluids flowing to wash out the body and fresh lemonade is ideal. Its vitamin C - considered the detox vitamin - helps convert toxins into a water - soluble form that?s easily flushed away. <br>  Watercress. Put a handful into salads, soups, and sandwiches. The peppery little green leaves have a diuretic effect that helps move things through your system. And cress is rich in minerals too. <br>  Garlic. Add it to everything - salads, sauces, spreads. In addition to the bulb's cardio benefits, it activates liver enzymes that help filter out junk. <br>  Green tea. This antioxidant-rich brew is one of the healthiest ways to get more fluids into your system. Bonus: It contains catechins, which speed up liver activity. <br>  Broccoli sprouts. Get 'em at your health-food store. They pack 20 to 50 times more cancer-fighting, enzyme-stimulating activity into each bite than the grown-up vegetable. <br>  Sesame seeds. They're credited with protecting liver cells from the damaging effects of alcohol and other chemicals. For a concentrated form, try tahini, the yummy sesame seed paste that?s a staple of Asian cooking. <br>  Cabbage. There are two main types of detoxifying enzymes in the liver; this potent veggie helps activate both of them. Coleslaw, anyone? <br>  Psyllium. A plant that?s rich in soluble fiber, like oat bran, but more versatile. It mops up toxins (cholesterol too) and helps clear them out. Stir powdered psyllium into juice to help cleanse your colon, or have psyllium-fortified Bran Buds for breakfast. <br>  Fruits, fruits, fruits. They're full of almost all the good things above - vitamin C, fiber, nutritious fluids, and all kinds of antioxidants. Besides, nothing tastes better than a ripe mango, fresh berries, or a perfect pear.|`|9f401380993e280c348855babee66e8baa	I think you should just try sticking to exercise and watching what you eat.

If you wanna just take off between 10-40 lbs and dont want it to take forever, i have heard good things about this system. If you wanna check it out, this is their site:<br>  <a href="http://www.applepatchdiet.com/ap16179/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.applepatchdiet.com/ap16179/in...</a>|`|2cSE4jHTaa	if you want to lose weight, improve your health generally, and have more energy then getting some nutritional help is vital. Once your body starts to absorb the right nutrients and vitamins and protein then you’ll be amazed how quickly you will feel the difference, usually within the first 48 hours if you get the right supplements and help. I had no energy and felt just generally rotten all round so I sought the advice of a nutritional coach (whose advice was FREE) and got myself some great products, I even got free samples before I got started so I could see just how good they were!! There is a website called myhealthabc.com  If go on there and fill out the details page you will get a call with no pressure about what you need. There is a mall area as well that’s got some great info and its all set out with easy to follow headings so you can find what you want. It’s so easy and the stuff they have is excellent. I have been using their products for over two years and I feel great.  I lost 70 pounds in less than seven months!! My sister lost 60 pounds in five months. The stuff is amazing
ICR4vTDuaa	Sweetheart thank you for talking about this first of all, you are not fat, not even close to fat, you have to learn to love yourself the way you are, please seek the help of a physician, starving yourself is making you sick, you are not getting the right diet so your mind is cloudy, don't hurt yourself you are worthy person and if this man cares for you he will accept you the way you are.  At 5'6" and 140 pounds you are not fat.  you are proportioned.  You need a balanced diet of fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat and breads to bring your body back to normal.  You cannot be happy with someone else until you are happy with yourself.  You have taken the first step in recognizing you have a problem the second step is to get the help you need to over come the depression and anorexia.  Share with your doctor and when you are feeling better emotionally and physically and you begin to like yourself, you will see what your boyfriend sees in you.  I bet he is telling you that you are not fat and he likes you the way you are.  I have faith that you can overcome this because you have already taken the first step.  Please don't consider suicide, it is a selfish act it takes care of your problems but it creates so many more problems for those who know and love you.  Like your parents, grandparents, siblings, friends and the list goes on.  learn to love yourself.  you are a worthy person and worthy of love and respect.  God bless and put angels on your pillows good luck sweetie.|`|5e13579ed762117faee44b64c5976ac7aa	You need professional help. do NOT delay in calling your local crisis center.|`|c152c343c050fc4646c64b9bc6544253aa	you need to take a moment to say ...<br>  my life is good and i love myself<br>  my bf is amazing and he loves me no matter what<br>  it could be worse so ill tough it out<br>  <br>  when things seem hard they can always be harder ... you get one leg amputated ... hey you could have lost both legs. <br>  the anorexia thing your weight is good for your height ... but like me you dont feel the greatest about yourself ... you should probably take a minute to look up some Mary Kate pics or some Nicole Riccie pics and think do i want to look like that?  <br>  cut out the coffe and sugars ... drink herbal teas and eat some fruits ... that will help with moods and all =)<br>  <br>  Hope things work out for ya, if ya need me im here.<br>  <br>  XoXo <br>  Emily|`|eU3jj8VFaa	I'd start by identifying the problem.

En una relación sexual normal la excitación en el hombre aumenta progresivamente hasta la fase llamada "meseta", disfrutando de su placer sexual hasta el momento que de forma voluntaria llega al clímax. El eyaculador precoz no puede permanecer en la fase de "meseta", sino que existe una excitación rápida y una eyaculación involuntaria y temprana.Tabla de contenidos<br>  <br>  Tipos<br>  La eyaculación precoz primaria se refiere a aquella que ha existido siempre, es decir, el individuo nunca ha controlado la eyaculación. La eyaculación precoz secundaria ocurre cuando se instaura en un momento determinado de la vida del individuo.<br>  <br>  Causas<br>  Causas orgánicasLas afecciones urogenitales de la uretra posterior y próstata, alteraciones de tipo neurológico, trastornos degenerativos, alteraciones vasculares, fármacos (antidepresivos, antihipertensivos, estimulantes), desequilibrios hormonales y todas aquellas enfermedades que alteran los mecanismos reflejos de la eyaculación.<br>  <br>  Causas psicológicas<br>  Son cuando dicen que uno pierde la razon y el control de que está teniendo relaciones sexuales, entonces eyacula sin intención.<br>  <br>  Otras causas<br>  Pueden ser: <br>  mensajes antisexuales en la infancia, falta de información sexual, presión por parte de la pareja, ambiente familiar problemático, ansiedad, estrés, miedo al fracaso, dificultad en controlar los estímulos.<br>  <br>  Tratamiento<br>  Los tratamientos más novedosos son fármacos y psicoterapia en general y en contados casos la cirugía (neurotomía selectiva). Sin embargo, la última línea de tratamiento más eficaz consiste en la terapia conjunta andrólogo-sexológica. Se trata de la administración de nuevos medicamentos que producen un retraso en el reflejo eyaculatorio unido a un proceso de psicoterapia de pareja paralelo que conlleva un aprendizaje de técnicas y ejercicios. La terapia tiene una duración de entre 3 y 6 meses y se consigue en 95% de éxito. Pueden frenar la terapia: la angustia anticipatoria al fracaso, si la pareja no colabora o no se compromete al tratamiento, la ausencia de comunicación y sensibilidad hacia los sentimientos de ambos miembros de la pareja, objeciones a las técnicas debido a actitudes rígidas, etc.Si se presenta o se sufre esta patología, lo mejor es consultar cuanto antes a un especialista; cuanto antes se consulte y empiece el tratamiento más pronta curación se obtendrá.La ayuda y colaboración de la pareja es esencial para solucionar el problema de la eyaculación precoz. La comunicación abierta entre la pareja evita conflictos conyugales. Por otro lado, la participación de la pareja en el proceso terapéutico está indicada y es tan importante que se convierte en un instrumento esencial para garantizar el éxito del tratamiento.En el caso de consulta por eyaculación precoz de un hombre sólo sin pareja, se acostumbra a seguir las mismas técnicas terapéuticas. El fin es el mismo, conseguir la capacidad de autocontrol en la medida que el hombre se conoce mejor a sí mismo y a su propia respuesta sexual librándose de temores, vergüenzas, complejos de inferioridad y aumentando se autoestima.<br>  <br>  Ejercicios caseros<br>  Existen algunos ejercicios caseros muy comunes para combatir la eyaculación precoz, aquí tenemos un peque?o resumen de dos de estos dichos ejercicios. Es imprescindible saber de que se tratan de ejercicios para personas que su eyaculaciones precoces no se deba por problemas fisicos en el aparato reproductor masculino ni similares.<br>  Ejercicio 1: Consiste basicamente en realizar una masturbación por cuenta propia o por tu pareja, en la que a la hora que el individuo sienta la necesidad de eyacular, parar durante unos 30-60 segundo o lo que sea necesario y continuar con el ejercicio hasta que se sienta un peque?o control sobre la marcha. Practicarlo durante 15 minutos cada día son suficientes.<br>  Ejercicio 2: Este, aunque mas sencillo puede ser igual de efectivo. Simplemente es "parar, continuar, parar, continuar" a la hora de orinar, eso si, se debe tener mucho en cuenta de que el paro no debe de ser superior a un segundo por que se fuerza a la vejiga a una fuerza no deseada lo que puede provocar dolores post-ejercitaddos. Con este ejercicio lo que hacemnso este tener un control sobre nuestra propia voluntad.<br>  <br>  Recuerda que si aparecen dolores sospechosos (mas que nada en la vejiga, genitales o escroto) parar cualquiera de estos ejercicios. Si continuan los dlores visite a su medico.<br>  <br>  Excepciones<br>  Hay individuos que pueden tener la capacidad de, incluso despues de eyacular mantener una erección sin problemas, lo que en principio no puede causar problemas a la hora de tener relaciones sexuales.Aunque estudios cientificos han afirmado y demostrado que "pensar en otras cosas" a la hora de tener relaciones sexuales no reterasa la eyaculación, hay individuos que al igual que pueden mantener una erección despues de eyacular, puede funcionar esta tecnica que consiste en pensar cosas no eroticas como la lista de la compra, ua anecdota o recordar cosas.Aunque son excepciones, hay casos existentes de personas que pueden tener alguna de estas dos habilidades como eyaculadores precoces.|`|7ba4b211100cfd51fb960776a160a45daa	La eyaculacion precoz es la deficiencia de controlar el momento en que se produce la eyculación, o la prontitud de esta al practicar el coito, por lo que este termina rápidamente, muchas veces sin que la pareja haya logrado alcanzar el orgasmo.<br>  <br>  En algunos muy pocos casos suele producirse un dolor he inflamación en los testículos que se resuelve rápidamente echándole mano a la obra. Para retener la eyaculacion sin riesgo y sin que se convierta en un impedimento para sentir placer, se debe hacer un entrenamiento como este…<br>  Muchas veces lo de la eyaculación precoz es solo mental y las mayorías de las veces solo refleja un deseo inconsciente de terminar con la copula lo antes posible, bien por miedos reales o irreales pero siempre infundado en el inconsciente.<br>  Algunos de estos miedos pueden ser por ejemplo:<br>  A ser descubierto en el acto.<br>  A ser rechazado por la pareja durante el acto.<br>  A que aparezca otro hombre y lo desplace a uno durante el acto.<br>  Esto suena muy irrisorio, pero el inconsciente de uno suele ser muy machista y actúa como cualquier otro individuo macho de cualquier otra especie.<br>  O simplemente porque realmente no se disfruta realmente del acto (por desamor o repulsión hacia la pareja), en cuyo caso el acto se realiza solo por necesidad física o compromiso… o por miedos.<br>  ?Como se combate?<br>  Ten una buena pareja, alguien a quien realmente quieras y de quien realmente te guste su personalidad.<br>  Tomate todo el tiempo que necesites. Organízate un par de retiros sexuales Ja Ja... ?Si igual que los espirituales pero sexuales!<br>  Si todo esto no te alcanza puedes probar con una buena taza de te de tilo y una buena limonada. Tómatelo un rato antes del acto claro. El tilo te relaja mentalmente y el limón te reducirá la presión arterial y esto reducirá la excitación del momento. También el alcohol sin excesos es un buen psicorelajante y retrasador de la eyaculación<br>  Ahora si queres convertir el sexo en una experiencia espiritual as lo siguiente. Has la copula de forma lenta con diez penetraciones leves y poco profundas, solo tócale la puerta y luego una bien fuerte y profunda, de esas en que le entras hasta el fondo he, luego sigues con otras diez suaves y otra profunda y así hasta... bueno averiguado por vos mismo.<br>  Ja Ja te aseguro que el te van a rogar e implorar desesperadamente que le produzcas un orgasmo y lo mejor es que cuando domines esta técnica podrás controlar y retener la eyaculación extender el coito todo lo que quieras, e inclusive podrás tener tu mismo orgasmos de los mas intensos sin siquiera eyacular, por lo que podrás volver al ataque en cuanto tu pareja recupere el aliento. Claro… si sobrevivió y puede recuperarlo ja ja<br>  Si puedes hazlo. No tienes idea de mundo de sensaciones y emociones que hay detrás de esta forma de hacer el amor. <br>  <br>  “El tao del sexo y del amor”|`|gDLeO1C3aa	esas son las consecuencias de andarse manueleandose a cada rato, si ya fueron al urólogo y al sexólogo y no les sirvió de nada pues no se que puedan hacer, vayan a con otros urologos y sexologos y dile a tu novio que ya no se manuele tan seguido, suerte|`|3634ed11cf59f375ffe6fdc53f49fa37aa	primero necesitas un a gran preparación antes de hacer el acto sexual--muchas caricias prologadas y contenerse con ellas una hora, al menos--luego el beso--y que ella no te muestre su órgano femenino--hasta que no este introducida tu verga..mucho movimiento y contención sin ninguna idea en mente y luego llegaras a dominar este asunto que se necesita mucha practica--suerte y vale--|`|49fb2abf54d029d5c9b2891a21ea1b03aa	que   que que|`|BR41Hcvuaa	MI NOVIO TIENE CASI EL MISMO PROBLEMA.<br>  EL HA MEJORAO MUXO..AL PRINCIPIO ERA PSICOLOGICO.<br>  PERO NO CREO QUE ESTO....<br>  HACERLO MAS SUAVE Y DESPACIO...<br>  LO QUE HACE MI NOVIO SIEMPRE ES HACERME SEXO ORAL...HASTA QUE ME LLEGUE CASI A....<br>  Y DESPUES LO HACEMOS NORMAL...Y ..<br>  BUENOS NO CREO QUE ESTO TE AYUDE..<br>  ES UNA OPINION DE COMO HACERLO.<br>  <br>  SALUDOS Y QUE TE VAYA BIEN|`|W0di3nxpaa	te aconsejo que se masturbe primero antes del acto sexual para que se le baje  un poco la excitación y luego poco a poco empecéis el juego para tener  un nuevo acto pero este ya con penetración, también le aconsejaría que no piense en lo que esta haciendo que piense en otra cosa que no tenga que ver con lo que hacéis (aunque suena frio es una buena solución).<br>  animo y a disfrutar!!|`|oxEq3Ediaa	Para la eyaculación precoz una buena ma,mada<br>  no ayudaria pero si para la disfunción erectil|`|tZzOfVT9aa	bueno querida te comento que muy preocupan te que ningún medico le encuentre la causa  busca otras opiniones medicas  pues la verdad el caso se ve grave

Crunches and leg raises (you can type those into youtube if you need to know how to do them)<br>      And for the muscles in your arms (triceps {backs of your arms} are probably what your talking about) light weight and high repped extensions... find a weight that you feel you can do 12-15 reps with and do 3 or 4 sets... <br>      remember everything takes time, dont be discouraged if you don't see immediate results.....<br>       good luck!|`|z9nCUpaOaa	Check out the free fat burning workout videos at ...<a href="http://www.FatX101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.FatX101.com</a>

El único posible, es que al estar circuncidado se pierde sensibilidad y dificulta la eyaculación, por lo que en caso de mantenerse relaciones con una persona infectada, uno no se  de infectaría por no eyacular. Pero por lo que se el sida ya se puede contagiar con el simple contacto de de los flujos corporales íntimos (como el lubricante que se suele emitir <br>  antes de la eyaculación), de uno u otro. Por ende nuevamente, no tiene fundamentos técnicos.<br>  <br>  ahí te va estrella. Por cierto esas estrellas deberían cobrárnosla unos cuantos puntos.

Caminar erguido le daba varias ventajas al hombre, sin embargo algunos antropólogos creen que el prepucio protegía el glande y evitaba que el hombre sufriera algún da?o en sus genitales al caminar entre la maleza. Con el paso del tiempo el prepucio dejó de cumplir dicha función. (Teoría antropológica)<br>  <br>  El relato bíblico obedece a una práctica de higiene entre los pueblos de las civilizaciones antiguas. Independientemente de la Alianza entre Yaveh y su pueblo.<br>  <br>  Se ha comprobado científica y clínicamente que la circuncisión reduce la posibilidad de contagio del VIH y se recomienda a culturas en donde la higiene no es muy común.<br>  <br>  Yo creo que el tema puede debatirse hasta el cansancio y es común que los no circuncidados satanicen ésta práctica. Yo decidí recurrir a la circuncisión por un problema "menor" en el prepucio. A?os después estoy feliz. Es cierto que se pierde mucha sensibilidad, no lo niego, sobre todo en el área del frenillo, pero las relaciones sexuales siguen siendo placenteras y me siento mucho mejor y más cómodo con el aspecto de mi pene.<br>  <br>  Y como dicen por ahí.......en gustos se rompen géneros.<br>  <br>  Creo que angustiar a los padres por una decisión que ya no pueden cambiar no es muy justo y no se vale.

Creo que no , pues tu comentario, aparte de ser solo una opinion (muy raquitica por cierto) no tiene base ni fundamento. Cito al Dr. Adrián Sapettiel y su ejemplo  del "alfiler" del que tanto te mofas (realmente lo entendiste?) <br>   "Es evidente que la circuncisión afecta la manera en que el hombre siente placer durante el sexo, ya sea, solos (masturbación) o con pareja. Lo que hay que aclarar es que no hay una disminución del placer, sino un CAMBIO en cómo se siente, y un cambio que, la gran mayoría de los que se operan de adultos, percibe como positivo. Es importante diferenciar los conceptos de PLACER y SENSIBILIDAD. Por ejemplo, si nos pinchamos el dedo con una aguja, estamos sintiendo placer? No. En ese caso, hay un alto nivel de sensibilidad, pero nos provoca DOLOR y MOLESTIA, y no placer. En general, la mayoría de los no-circuncidados tienen una hiper-sensibilidad en el glande, debido a que está la mayor parte del tiempo cubierto, húmedo y sin acceso al roce externo. Al tener una erección y descubrir el glande, muchos hombres sienten un exceso de sensibilidad, lo cual es incómodo y físicamente molesto, muy lejos de una actividad controlada y placentera (como el sexo debiera ser)".<br>   Referente a lo de que si es un anticonseptivo, debemos aclarar que la  OMS y la ONUSIDA recomendaron el 28 de marzo de 2007, por primera vez, la circuncisión masculina como una intervención importante adicional para reducir el riesgo de contagio del virus del Sida por vía heterosexual, jamas dijeron que te protegia de embarazos no deseados, porque sabes lo que es un anticonseptivo no???<br>   TETE no te arrepientas de haber hecho algo que tal ves pueda beneficiar a tu hijo solo por una mera opinion, investiga(fuentes fidedignas como un urologo) y si encuentras algo que realmente lo vaya a perjudicar, entonses si lamentalo.<br>  <br>  RESOLVIENDO TU DUDA<br>   Circuncidado yo? Si, desde hace 3 anos. El sexo? Magnifico!  Y tu lo estas? Te "privaron de tu derecho a elegir" (infecciones y enfermedades)? Es esa la razon de tan errada y dolida opinion?Perdiste la capacidad de sentir placer? Si es asi demanda a quien la realizo, porque esto no suele suceder, mi mas sentido pesame.<br>  RESOLVIENDO TU OTRA DUDA<br>  Virgen circuncidado? Error, Tengo 29 anos y la circuncicion me la hice hace apenas 3, y antes de hacerlo tuve innumerables  sesiones de sexo; Por ende se lo que se siente con y sin prepucio. No querer a tu madre por tratar de evitar que pases por situaciones bochornosas y dolorosas? Venga que tu si estas mal. Ciertamente te lo digo que si mi madre me hubiese hecho la circuncicion de nino me habria evitado muchas molestia de adulto.

227ac8c6431ccde9d352f9fac4bfa558aa	Ma. de los Angeles, hola, partimos de la base que la falta de control de la eyacualación es un trastorno sexual (disfunción)<br>  <br>  La eyaculación precoz se refiere a la incapacidad del hombre de controlar el reflejo eyaculatorio De hecho le llamamo hoy por hoy "falta de control eyaculatorio"... porque tambien pasa al revés, puedes tardar muchisimo en eyacular... por eso se le ha cambiado la forma de llamar a esta disfunción... <br>  <br>  La eyaculación rápida conlleva problemas psicológicos frente a la pareja. Aunque suele afectar más a hombres sin experiencia, también puede sobrevenir por situaciones de estrés, ansiedad o falta de motivación. Las causas suelen ser psicológicas y no hay ninguna medicación que la cure. Salvo en casos en que se administrará algún tipo de ansiolitico pero son casos aislados que los tratará un psiquiatra <br>  <br>  <br>  La forma de controlar el reflejo eyaculatorio pasa por el aprendizaje<br>  <br>  Los ejercicios de Kegel, junto con el aprendizaje de técnicas de relajación, son actualmente la terapia más efectiva. <br>  éstos comienzan con la práctica de la masturbación en solitario para, una vez controlado el reflejo eyaculatorio, pasar a la masturbación en pareja. <br>  <br>  Debes identificar el momento en que no puedes "controlar tu eyaculación" en ese momento hay que detenerse, relajarse y comenzar de nuevo cuando el nivel de excitación haya disminuido. <br>  <br>  También está relacionado con la postura en la que se realice el coito; normalmente, el hombre tiene mayor control cuando está tumbado boca arriba... <br>  <br>  Ahora Amiga, si te refieres al Liquido pre-seminal o emisión seminal ,  no lo pueden controlar esa peque?a emisión de semen que obviamente tiene espermas, no es controlable es por reflejo.<br>  <br>  Deseo haberte orientado y contestado lo que realmente querías saber.|`|970458c0086b64b4404c3987970863a4aa	no soy sexologo. mira se puede controlar depende la situacion . cuando es mucha la exitacion, es muy dificil apenas echandote agua fria o yo que se jajaja.<br>  <br>  pero si algunos hombres quieren hacer alarde de temas como ese . es muy dificil controlarlo a mi experiencia , pero con bastante consentracion se puede : )|`|ce398f78bfceeb0dcbbf6ede5e3aa266aa	No soy sexologa....pero por experiencia t digo k se puede controlar..<br>  <br>  mi pareja espera a k yo tenga el orgasmo, asi k podria penetrarme tooda la noche, me canso primero yo antes k el...ja..<br>  <br>  antes no era asi, el fue aprendiendo a controlarlo,,,manteniendo la ereccion pero sin eyaculacion....<br>  <br>  eso depende d la persona..<br>  <br>  cuidate...vai!!!|`|gDLeO1C3aa	si se puede|`|CBBdVFK0aa	sipoo<br>  obvio que si,,,,|`|cjprjqoaaa	si la puede controlar solo que necesita estar de siertamanera concentrado para no eyacular tan pronto|`|dbdc0d33eb73f2e24ca9768fc43824c0aa	?Hola María!<br>  <br>  No es mentira. Controlar la eyaculación sí es posible y es algo que cualquier hombre puede lograr, aunque no se trata de un procedimiento mágico que de manera instantánea logre resultados.<br>  <br>  En lo personal te sugiero que hagas caso omiso de ungüentos, pomadas, pastillas y demás elementos que pretenden vender como artículos casi milagrosos. Algo realmente efectivo es aprender un poco de sexo tántrico. De esa manera tu pareja podrá -al igual que tú- disfrutar de varios orgasmos antes de la eyaculación. Después de todo, recordemos que el órgano sexual más poderoso es el cerebro.<br>  <br>  ?Saludos!|`|e8e869ad94c5f4de1bf171003e560cbdaa	Amiga eso es totalmente cierto , muchos hombres pueden controlar cuando quieren eyacular si rapidamente ó tardarse mucho.

Creatine should only be used when your body dosent produce enough, or when your in your 40s.<br>  I think of it as cigarrettes, and steroids is weed. Its cheaper, it holds water back in your body so it builds around muscle making you seem buff, when its retained water.<br>  Dont take creatine, if you do, dont consider yourself a weight lifter or body builder becouse your not doing it by urself. stick to protein shakes until your in your late 30s

toniKr3Qaa	Losing weight is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/caloriecalclb.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...</a>  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/dieting.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/d...</a><br>  The 9 Week Straight Diet - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a><br>  Health, Exercise and Diets - <a href="http://straighthealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com</a>|`|35432634b61cc54cf68475108297f1f7aa	Eat lots of spicy food and onions,they'll help you burn some calories,  plus do three times more excercise than what you eat, climbing and hiking are good ways to lose weight super fast|`|TIGsxAm7aa	wow, I just realized that back when I had a high metabolism, I was on a spicy food kick, but I loved Thai food, which was mostly spicy vegys. good tip. spicy food really does make me feel like I ate way more that I really did, because it makes your taste buds happy.<br>  <br>  I avoid breakfast, because it messes with my blood sugar, because I have reactive hypoglycemia, and eating just a little sugar makes it drop, making me really hungry the rest of the day.|`|PWL5GQ6Baa	I DUNNO

Vuelvo a las respuestas despues de mucho tiempo...  Intentare responder a tu pregunta brevemente ya que la anticoncepcion es hoy dia (y lo fue en los ultimos cinco a?os) un tema de amplio debate, ya sea desde el punto de vista medico, como social y religioso.<br>  Existen numerosos metodos anticoncepceptivos (o contraceptivos... en la traduccion de la palabra anglosajona), pero los que más fama tienen hoy son: <br>  Anticoncepcion Oral (aco), metodos  de Barrera (mb) y anticoncepcion quirugica (acq).<br>  En primer lugar encontramos a los Anticonceptivos Orales... Estos son preparados que contienen derivados de hormonas humanas (Estrogeno y Progesterona) modificadas quimicamente para poder cumplir su funcion de INHIBIDORES de un "eje" (conocido como Hipotalamo - Hipofisis - Ovario) esencial en el proceso de Ovulacion. Las drogas anticonceptivas emulan las hormonas humanas produciendo una inhibicion de este eje, evitando asi que del ovario salga un óvulo pasible de ser fecundado. (Seria muy extenso y poco constructivo que te explique la manera en que estos farmacos inhiben la ovulacion...). Al no producirse la ovulacion, los espermatozoides que llegan al ap. genital femenino (generalmente a las trompas donde comunmente se produce la fecundacion) no tienen nada que "fecundar" por tanto mueren a las pocas horas o dias. (Recuerda que un espermatozoide puede sobrevivir 72 hs en el cpo femenino). Estos metodos (y lo digo en prural porque existen numerosas asociaciones farmacologicas...ej Estradiol y pregnenolona, Etinil estradiol y gestodeno...etc) son muy bueno anticonceptivos, tienen una eficacia del 98.7% y traen muy pocos efectos adversos si son recetados por un medico... Por otro lado, algunos aco son utilizados para disminuir el acne y controlar el sobrepeso en cierto tipo de pacientes.... pero recuerda algo muy importante: NO PREVIENEN LAS ENFERMEDADES DE TRANSMISION SEXUAL Y SU EFICACIA DEPENDE DE QUE LAS PASTILLAS SEAN RELIGIOSAMENTE TOMADAS TODOS LOS DIAS.... y aqui pasamos al segundo tipo de metodo anticonceptivo........ los métodos de Barrera....<br>  Los metodos de barrera (llamados asi porque imagina que le pones una pared a los espermatozoides para evitar que lleguen a fecundar el ovulo)... existen tanto para ser usados por hombres  (preservativos) como por mujeres (diafragma).<br>  La principal ventaja de estos es que previenen las enfermedades de transm. sexual a  la vez que impiden la fecundacion. Su eficacia es menor que la de los anticonceptivos orales (un  1% menos )... pero recuerda siempre que SON LOS UNICOS QUE PREVIENEN LAS ENFERMEDADES DE TRANSMISION SEXUAL.<br>  En ultimo lugar encontramos la anticoncepcion Quirugica (por cirugia)... tanto en su version para el hombre (llamada vasectomia) como para la mujer (ligadura y seccion de trompas). Estas tecnicas son sumamente eficaces (efectividad 99.7%), pero su principal desventaja es que son IRREVERSIBLES en su mayor parte... por tanto piensa y evalua dos veces antes de hacerlo....<br>  En fin... Nosotros los medicos (o por lo menos yo) no estandarizamos el tratamiento a toooodos los pacientes, sino que lo adecuamos a la necesidad de cada uno.. <br>  Si sos joven y tenes mas de una pareja sexual... yo te recomiendo el PRESERVATIVO por lo que expuse anteriormente.... (Recuerda que si tu pareja  se acuesta con vos solamente... pero vos no.... cuidalo/a tambien a ella usando preservativo.....)<br>  Si tenes una pareja estable y no tiras la ca?ita por ahi ni el /ella tampoco... es bueno que pienses en los  anticonceptivos orales... pero recuerda lo que dije anteriormente de las desventajas....<br>  Si sos mayor y ya tenes hijos (y no queres tener mas) el metodo mas efectivo siguen siendo el preservativo y los anticonceptivos orales... pero existe la posibilidad de que estes cansado/a de usarlos y decides someterte a una cirugia... para eso estan los metodos quirugicos....<br>  <br>  En fin.... Los tres que te nombre son buenos, elige el que mas se adecue a tu forma de vida y a la de tu pareja... y algo que es muy importante.... LA relacion sexual se hace entre dos personas y con el consentimiento de ambas... el metodo anticonceptivo a usar tambien "se usa" entre los dos y por tanto debe ser  una decision mutua........<br>  <br>  Espero te haya sido de utilidad lo que te conte.!!!<br>                        un abrazo|`|7f98c3c0dc384a4219dea2478b8c6097aa	ES EL NOPAL PEQUE?O<br>  ES DECIR, NO PALITO.

Esto debido a que no aumentan los niveles de azúcar en la sangre ni aportan calorías, y beneficia a quienes tienen sobrepeso u obesidad en la diabetes tipo II.<br>  <br>  La profesional también brindó otros consejos:<br>  <br>  1 - Las comidas de un día para otro deben tener una composición constante, especialmente en la tipo I, alimentos ricos en hidratos de carbono (cereales, arroz, pastas alimenticias, pan, papas, legumbres, frutas). El médico especialista controlará su distribución por día.<br>  <br>  2 - Horarios regulares de comidas y sin evitar ninguna (especialmente en la tipo I, ya que de no ser así, se corre el riesgo de tener bajadas bruscas de azúcar en la sangre produciéndose el cuadro de hipoglucemia).<br>  <br>  3 - Fraccionada: 5 ó 6 tomas diarias (menor volumen de alimento por toma, mejor control).<br>  <br>  4 - Control en alimentos que contienen hidratos de carbono simples (azúcar, miel, mermelada, bebidas azucaradas, frutas, repostería industrial, golosinas dulces, chocolates y derivados).<br>  <br>  5 - Puede permitirse un consumo esporádico y controlado de alimentos que contienen estos hidratos de carbono sencillos, siempre y cuando se tomen junto con otros ricos en fibra o grasa o proteínas. Estos reducen su velocidad de absorción y de este modo impiden aumentos bruscos de los niveles de azúcar en sangre. Algunos ejemplos son: jugos de fruta (contienen fructosa, azúcar de la fruta) sin azucarar; frutos secos (ricos en grasas, proteínas y fibra); leche; bollo con margarina , etcétera.<br>  <br>  Asimismo, se recuerda reducir el consumo de grasas saturadas y colesterol.<br>  <br>  En la diabetes tipo I se admite el empleo de productos especiales que llevan fructosa e incluyen en su composición mayor cantidad de grasas que sus equivalentes normales (galletas, turrones, chocolates, que llevan fructosa). No ocurre lo mismo en la tipo II, por su asociación al sobrepeso u obesidad.<br>  <br>  Hay que tener en cuenta que el alcohol es hipoglucemiante, en caso de tomarlo, incluirlo en las principales comidas y nunca en ayunas.<br>  <br>  - Preferir aquellas técnicas culinarias que menos grasa aportan a los alimentos: al agua, cocido o hervido, vapor, rehogado, plancha, horno.<br>  <br>  - Utilizar moderadamente los fritos, rebozados, empanadas, guisos y estofados.<br>  <br>  - Probar desgrasar en frío, que mejora la conservación y la calidad nutricional.<br>  <br>  - Para que la comida resulte más apetitosa se pueden emplear diversos condimentos como: ácidos (vinagre y limón); aliáceos (ajo, cebolla, siboullete, cebollín, puerro, según tolerancia); hierbas aromáticas (albahaca, hinojo, comino, estragón, laurel, tomillo, orégano, perejil); evitar las especias fuertes (pimienta, pimentón, ají chileno).<br>  <br>  - El vinagre y el aceite y si es de oliva o maíz mejor, pueden ser macerados con hierbas aromáticas.<br>  <br>  - En la elaboración de salsas, los vinos u otras bebidas alcohólicas como ingrediente flambeados pueden hacer más sabrosas diversas recetas.<br>  <br>  - Para endulzar los postres pueden emplearse edulcorantes no calóricos y canela y/o vainilla<br>  <br>  <br>  Entra a estas paginas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://healthlibrary.epnet.com/GetContent.aspx?token=8482e079-8512-47c2-960c-a403c77a5e4c&chunkiid=124684" rel="nofollow">http://healthlibrary.epnet.com/GetConten...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cormillot.com/diabetes/nota_dbts_140803_alimentario.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cormillot.com/diabetes/nota_d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alimentacion-sana.com.ar/informaciones/Nutricion/alim%20diab.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alimentacion-sana.com.ar/info...</a>|`|KceyGVnIaa	Mira, veo varios menús, pero la realidad es que solo tu nutriologa te puede decir que puedes y que no puedes comer, por ejemplo en los menús que te dan, hacen mención de queso, queso rallado (si lo compras a granel viene muy salado), y si lo puedes comer solo que este te impide comer cualquier tipo de carne(de esta puedes comer 30 grs por día, 3/4 de taza de leche, no jugos de fruta, 2 tunas, 15 uvas, 1 taza de melón, 1 taza de papaya, 10 fresas, yougurth bajo en grasa y sin azúcar, crema 2 cucharadas, 1 cucharada por día de margarina,frijoles, lentejas, elote 1/2 pieza,  jamón 30 grs.

WeRyMLE4aa	Tienes que hacer una dieta hipocalorica.Y muy baja en grasas.<br>  Es decir, durante un tiempo debes de no superar las 1.7oo calorías-día. Así te bajaran los trigliceridos y te subieran el HDL.(Colesterol bueno).<br>  Elimina las carnes. Todas y la piel de pollo. Estos alimentos están a tope de grasas saturadas, que son las que elevan los trigliceridos. Elimina también los huevos, el alcohol y los productos lácteos sin descremar.<br>  De todas formas y pese a estas indicaciones que te doy, debes de ir a un nutricionista o endocrino, que sera quien de verdad y de tu a tu te ponga la dieta que te interesa para bajar los lipidos ( grasas ) de tu organismo.<br>  El seguir los consejos por aquí e peligroso para tu salud. <br>  Yo te doy una indicación teniendo en cuenta de que vas a ir a tu medico.

El pan no debe ser a base de<br>  harina, usar el dietètico y poca cantidad. Consumir una fruta<br>  por cada almuerzo o cena. ( no abusar porque tambièn contienen azùcar). Las bebidas alcoholicas tambièn contienen azùcar, beber en forma moderada.<br>  Las carnes deben ser magras, sin grasa.<br>  A mi me dio resultado todo esto, espero que te sirva, hay<br>  que tener paciencia.<br>  Consulta con tu mèdico por el tratamiento.|`|rtOUUZq3aa	Qué son los triglicéridos?<br>  <br>  Los triglicéridos son el principal tipo de grasa transportado por el organismo. Recibe el nombre de su estructura química. Luego de comer, el organismo digiere las grasas de los alimentos y libera triglicéridos a la sangre. Estos son transportados a todo el organismo para dar energía o para ser almacenados como grasa.<br>  <br>  El hígado también produce triglicéridos y cambia algunos a colesterol. El hígado puede cambiar cualquier fuente de exceso de calorías en triglicéridos.<br>  <br>  ?Cuál es el nivel normal de triglicéridos?<br>  <br>  Los niveles de triglicéridos varían con la edad, y también dependen de qué tan reciente ingirió alimentos antes del examen. La medición es más precisa si no se ha comido en las 12 horas previas al examen. El valor normal es de 150 mg/dL. Para quienes sufren problemas cardiacos, los niveles de esta sustancia deben ser inferiores a los 100 mg./dl.<br>  <br>  Si el colesterol tiene un valor normal, un nivel elevado de triglicéridos no parece ser un factor de riesgo de enfermedad cardiaca, pero sí puede ser riesgoso al asociarse con diabetes y pancreatitis.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo están asociados los triglicéridos al colesterol?<br>  <br>  Cuando la persona come, los triglicéridos se combinan con una proteína en su sangre para formar lo que se llama lipoproteínas de alta y baja densidad. Estas partículas de lipoproteínas contienen colesterol. Para formar triglicéridos en el hígado el proceso es similar; el hígado toma los carbohidratos y proteínas sobrantes de la comida y los cambia a grasa. Esta grasa entonces se combina con proteína y colesterol para formar lipoproteínas de muy baja densidad, que son liberadas al torrente circulatorio.<br>  <br>  ?Qué causa altos niveles de Triglicéridos?<br>  <br>  Puede tener varias causas:<br>  <br>  · Exceso de peso: los triglicéridos aumentan generalmente a medida que aumenta el peso<br>  <br>  · Consumo excesivo de calorías: Los triglicéridos se elevan a medida que se aumenta de peso o se ingieren demasiadas calorías, especialmente provenientes de azúcar y del alcohol. El alcohol aumenta la producción de triglicéridos en el hígado.<br>  <br>  · Edad: los niveles de triglicéridos aumentan regularmente con la edad<br>  <br>  · Medicamentos: Algunas drogas como los anticonceptivos, esteroides, diuréticos causan aumento en los niveles de los triglicéridos.<br>  <br>  · Enfermedades: La diabetes, el hipotiroidismo, las enfermedades renales y hepáticas están asociadas con niveles altos de triglicéridos. Entre los grupos que deben vigilar con mayor cuidado su nivel de triglicéridos se encuentran los diabéticos y las mujeres después de la menopausia. Más de un 75% de los diabéticos tienen los niveles de triglicéridos altos y el 30% de las mujeres que han pasado por la menopausia sufren de este mismo problema.<br>  <br>  · Herencia: algunas formas de altos niveles de triglicéridos ocurren entre miembros de una misma familia.<br>  <br>  ?Cuál es el tratamiento recomendado?<br>  <br>  El tratamiento incluye:<br>  <br>  Perder peso. Generalmente, cuando se pierde peso, se logran bajar los niveles de triglicéridos.<br>  <br>  Controle su ingesta de carbohidratos y azúcar. Es importante disminuir la cantidad de carbohidratos consumidos (pan, arroz, frijoles, papa y verduras harinosas, pastas, cereales); preferiblemente optar por las opciones integrales. Además, ingiera menos cantidad de azúcar y de alimentos que contengan azúcar. Se recomienda reemplazar azúcar con edulcorante artificial. Es esencial consumir una cantidad adecuada de frutas y vegetales para proteger las arterias y el corazón<br>  <br>  Disminuir el consumo de alcohol. Algunas personas son mas propensas a que el alcohol aumente la producción de triglicéridos por el hígado.<br>  <br>  Disminuir el consumo de grasa total y saturada. Elija sus calorías provenientes de la grasa sabiamente: primero, es importante mantener la cantidad de grasa consumida al mínimo, y luego, es importante evitar el tipo de grasa de origen animal (mantequilla, natilla, helados de crema, lácteos enteros, carnes muy grasosas, piel del pollo) y el tipo de grasa llamado trans (este se encuentran en productos parcialmente hidrogenados). El comer pescado 2-3 veces a la semana, ya que el aceite de pescado (Ej. Salmón) reducen los niveles de triglicéridos.<br>  <br>  Si con estas medidas y cambios en hábitos alimenticios no disminuyen los niveles, se inicia tratamiento con medicamentos tipo ácido nicotínico y Gemfibrozil. Se debe advertir si sufre de enfermedades hepáticas, diabetes, gota, úlceras, arritmias cardiacas en caso de tomar ácido nicotínico.|`|wy4yH8R7aa	Puedes tomar Simvastatina, Atorvastatina que bajan los niveles de Triglicéridos y los ejercicios son muy efectivos, al cabo de 1 mes te repites sólo el análisis de Triglicéidos.

bP960sWXaa	I am going to take a stab at the reason and say (like you) it is gingivitis.Gingivitis is the inflammation or infection of the gums caused by buildup. There are two kinds of buildup, (#1) soft sticky plaque which turns into (#2) tartar that is hard like cement. If she hasn't had a cleaning she should see a dentist or hygienist for a checkup, xrays (if needed) and a cleaning. During the cleaning the plaque and tartar will be removed. Although she can remove plaque at home by flossing and with brushing 2-3 times a day the tartar cannot be removed because it is too hard and often inaccessible. She must get rid of this infection or it can evolve into periodontal disease, which is when the bone surrounding your teeth begins to breakdown. This disease leads to chronic bad breath, cavities and eventually loss of teeth. Dental (mouth) health is directly related to a healthy body.If she doesn't want to go to the dentist because of cost she could always go to a dental or hygiene school. Hope that helps!<br>  JAMRDH - a dental hygienist|`|hnNjxFjbaa	She needs to see the dentist. It sounds like gum disease. Gingivitis is reversable but if it has progressed, it can only be controled. Your sister may need a deep cleaning from a dental hygenist. Sometimes brushing and flossing is not enough. Sometimes we miss spots and plaque turns hard and no amount of brushing takes it off. It irritates the gums and they bleed, swell, turn red, or receed. Healthy gums do not bleed. The doc will do a deep cleaning and maybe prescribe a rinse. The treatments are very effective. She prob has bad breath also. My husband did it and he said it's the best things he's ever done. Bad breath disappeared after day2 of the cleaning. And he tasted better and smelled better.  If she ignores it, tell her it leads to bone/teeth loss. Pull up some pics on the internet. It's not painful now but as it advances, there will be pain and then it'll be too late. Bring her to the dentist and tell her you'll be right there for her the whole way. They're the experts. Good luck! =)|`|FRT8e5NSaa	She bleeds when she brushes and flosses because she doesnt do it regularly.  If she continues to brush and floss at least twice a day for 2-3 minutes each time the bleeding with stop.  They aren't healthy right now because she hasnt been getting the gunk out from the interproximal spaces.|`|PdSCv6PFaa	she should brush at least twice a day and gargle w/Listerene, duh!|`|Ymjr6DzTaa	she must go see a dentist but she can disolve some salt in water and rinse with it. Like if it was listerine...|`|lyoA8EACaa	I HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY GUMS BLEEDING AND IT WASN'T JUST GINGIVITIS. SHE NEEDS TO GO TO A DENTIST. I WAITED TOO LONG AND ALMOST LOST MY TEETH. IF SHE IS BRUSHING AND FLOSSING THEN SHE SHE MAY HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. A DENTIST OR PERIODONTIST ARE PROFESSIONALS. IF THERE IS DENTAL SCHOOL IN YOUR AREA  THEY MAY BE ABLE TO HELP FOR LESS EXPENSE. ALSO THE BLOOD FROM THE GUMS MADE ME NAUSEOUS AND AFFECTED MY OVERAALL HEALTH. I TRIED DIFFERENT HOME TEATMENTS. THEY DIDN'T WORK.

If your nose is not causing any medical problems, the only reason to get it fixed is for appearance.   Surgery to fix your nose will probably cost anywhere from $2000 - $4000.  So, the question you need to decide is whether it would be worth the money.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	You've got a deviated septum.  It's not a bad thing and doesn't need to get fixed if it doesn't bother you.

GJigS2N6aa	Hola!!! Creeme, tener cistitis es de lo peor que te puede pasar por lo incómoda y dolorosa que puede ser. Pero que aparte de todo estés hinchada como globo pues es peor aún. Afortunadamente una cistitis tratada a tiempo no tiene mayores consecuencias. La fórmula de los medicamentos ahorita no la recuerdo pero yo suelo tomar un medicamento que se llama Macrodantina. También hay uno que se llama Azo-Wintomilon, no sé cual de los dos corresponda con lo que te mandaron. Ambos son buenos y esta bien que tomes agua durante el tratamiento. Lo que puede ser es que estas reteniendo líquidos por lo que deberías tomar un diurético, ya sea natural (te de flor de jamaica, ensalada de apio, col y pepino, etc.) o farmacológico (Miccil, Lasix). También evita la sal y con ésto debería desaparecer la hinchazón. Otra cosa: los padecimientos del ri?ón están estrechamente ligados con la presión arterial y ésta se manifiesta a través de hinchazón y retención de líquidos. Te digo, la retencion de líquidos debería desaparecer en un día más o menos, pero si ésta persiste y además la cistitis no cede o va empeorando y detectas dolor pélvico o abdominal, temperatura, etc. debes de acudir inmediatamente al médico. No dejes el tratamiento si no la infección puede volver y más fuerte. Que te mejores pronto!! Saludos!!|`|hnbta8pPaa	Si acude de nuevo al medico, mira esta pagina:<br>  <a href="http://www.tusalud.com.mx/120502.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tusalud.com.mx/120502.htm</a>|`|gDLeO1C3aa	hazte una nueva revisión médica, suerte|`|urJuJlA6aa	Consejos para la cistitis:  Tomar agua (ya lo está haciendo), lavar a mano los panties, cambiarsélos mínimo diariamente, que no sean apretados ni hilos, no usar pa?itos protectores diarios, hacerse ba?os con su propia orina e inclusive tomar la primera de la ma?ana.  Los productos químicos no curan solo alivian los síntomas.

Algunas formas de poliosis pueden ser heredadas o estar asociadas a otras condiciones de la piel.<br>  Las canas prematuras también pueden estar asociadas con otras condiciones como vitiligo, alopecia areata, enfermedades de la tiroides, anemia y deficiencia de vitamina B-12, esta última es más común en personas que siguen una dieta vegetariana estricta. <br>  Al intentar determinar la causa de las canas en los ni?os es importante evaluar tres aspectos: el historial familiar, buscando tendencias hereditarias; un examen físico completo que nos provea claves importantes y luego realizar pruebas de sangre que incluyan, niveles de vitamina B12, CBC (para ver la hemoglobina) y pruebas de función de la tiroides.

TcYsHPpcaa	Programa diario de ejercicios para agrandar el pene en largo y ancho<br>  - Precalentamiento (5 minutos)<br>  - Ejercicios de Estiramiento (25 a 30 minutos)<br>  - Ejercicios de Crecimiento y Circulación (1 minuto)<br>  - Ejercicios de Orde?e (10 a 20 minutos)<br>  - Ejercicios del PC (5 minutos)<br>  - Masaje y enfriamiento (5 a 10 minutos)<br>  <br>  <br>  PRECALENTAMIENTO DEL PENE (5 Minutos)<br>  Moje una toalla en agua caliente o tibia, escurriendo el exceso de agua. Envuelva la toalla alrededor de su pene (flácido o erecto). Manténgala así un minuto, y repita un par de veces más. Seque bien su pene. Esto asegurará buena adherencia para los ejercicios que va a realizar.<br>  EJERCICIOS DE ESTIRAMIENTO DEL PENE (25 a 30 minutos)<br>  1. Con el pene en estado flácido y con una mano coja firmemente alrededor de la cabeza de su pene. Preste atención en no cortar demasiado la circulación.<br>  2. Estire su pene hacia fuera justo en frente de usted. Estírelo tanto como pueda sin que cause da?o o incomodidad. Manténgalo así durante 5 minutos. Después de cada minuto, estírelo un poco más hacia fuera.<br>  3. Relájese por un minuto. “Tuerza” su pene en un movimiento circular unas 30 veces. Esto ayuda a activar la circulación.<br>  4. Repita el paso 2 otras 4 veces, excepto que estire su pene en direcciones diferentes cada vez...arriba, abajo, a la izquierda y a la derecha. Después de cada estiramiento de 5 minutos repita el paso 3.<br>  5. Después de completar 5 estiramientos (de 5 minutos cada uno), estire su pene hacia fuera y en frente de usted una vez más. Dese un estiramiento de 1 minuto largo y 10 ligeros tirones hacia fuera, no demasiado fuertes.<br>  EJERCICIO DE CRECIMIENTO DEL PENE Y CIRCULACIóN (1 minuto)<br>  Cójase el pene y azóteselo con suavidad. No lo azote más de 30 veces, asegurándose que se protege el escroto con la otra mano, sino podría lastimarse.<br>  EJERCICIOS DE ORDE?E DEL PENE (ORDE?AR) (10 a 20 minutos)<br>  1. Usando aceite para masaje o vaselina lubricante deslice sus dedos sobre la piel de su pene y aplíquelo en toda su extensión. Unas pocas gotas de aceite durarán unos cientos de pasadas. No use jabón o le escocerá durante días!<br>  2. Con su pulgar e índice apriete la base del eje de su pene. Estire hacia abajo. Haga durar cada pasada unos 3 segundos. Esta sensación debería provocarle una erección.<br>  3. Cuando su pene esté SEMIERECTO haga el signo “OK” con el pulgar y el índice de su mano izquierda. Con esta mano, apriete fuertemente alrededor de la base de su pene.<br>  4. Ahora, empezando desde la base, estire el pene suavemente pero con firmeza. Estire hacia abajo y hacia fuera. Tendría que seguir estando en un estado de semierección. Asegúrese de tocar a lo largo de todo el pene desde la base hasta el glande. Observe que el glande se expande debido a la sangre.<br>  5. Cambie a la mano derecha y haga lo mismo, empezando por la base y estirando hacia abajo y hacia el glande. Alterne las dos manos en un suave movimiento rítmico (“orde?e”), tocando cada parte del pene excepto la punta del glande.<br>  Haga de 200 a 300 orde?es/día a fuerza media durante la primera semana (10 minutos).<br>  Haga de 300 a 500 orde?es/día a fuerza media-máxima la siguiente semana (15 minutos).<br>  Haga 500 o más orde?es/día en adelante, y tan fuertes como pueda (20 minutos).<br>  (Si le sobreviene una erección durante este ejercicio apriete fuerte para evitarla o simplemente espere hasta que desaparezca. Puede activar la circulación después abofeteándose el pene arriba y abajo de 25 a 50 veces. Haga este ejercicio 5 días a la semana. Recuerde mantener su pene en erección parcial. Si siente que va a eyacular, pare de orde?arse hasta que el impulso desaparezca. Esto es en sí mismo un ejercicio...uno de autocontrol.)<br>  EJERCICIOS PARA EL MUSCULO PC (5 minutos)<br>  Observe las directrices de cómo encontrar su músculo PC. Haga distintas variaciones de estos ejercicios cada vez que realice su programa de entrenamiento. También puede hacer sus ejercicios del PC a lo largo del día mientras conduce, ve la televisión, dondequiera.<br>  1. Realice rápidas CONTRACCIONES del PC. Apriete y afloje, una y otra vez. Empiece con veinte repeticiones, y después aumente a 100 o más. Haga al menos 250 repeticiones cada día, durante el resto de su vida. Su objetivo es ser capaz de hacer 1000 contracciones al día.<br>  2. Practique haciendo LARGOS APRETONES manteniendo el músculo PC fuertemente apretado durante treinta segundos, o tanto como pueda.<br>  3. Trate de hacer CONTRACCIONES GRADUALES: apriete y afloje en incrementos. Apriete por un par de segundos, afloje por un par de segundos. Hágalo una y otra vez.<br>  4. EXCITACIóN DEL PC: Apriete el músculo PC tan despacio como le sea posible. Cuando termine de apretar lentamente (hasta que ya no pueda más), déjelo ir. En cierto punto notará una agitación del PC, y se le pondrá piel de gallina en la columna. Cuando haga esto concéntrese respirando despacio y profundamente. Este es un ejercicio muy bueno para recargar energía cuando esté cansado!<br>  5. Cuando está orinando y quiere liberarse de las últimas gotas usa su músculo PC en la otra dirección. Haciéndolo sentirá abrirse su ano y la sensación es diferente. Esto se llama SACAR EL PC.<br>  MASAJE Y ENFRIAMIENTO DEL PENE (5 a 10 minutos)<br>  Después de sus ejercicios, masajee suavamente su pene durante unos minutos. Si lo prefiere, puede hacer esto con la "herbal enlargement cream". Después del masaje, puede aplicarse otra toalla caliente como hizo al empezar sus ejercicios, o puede poner su pene en un bol de agua tibia durante algunos minutos. Cualquiera de estas “aplicaciones de calor” mantendran retenida la sangre en su pene estimulando las partes da?adas a recuperarse y funcionar mejor. Séquese bien con una toalla.<br>  Bien, este es el programa de entrenamiento. Estos son los ejercicios, los “secretos” que le darán un pene más largo, grueso y fuerte... una erección más firme...mejores orgasmos...y un vigor sexual de por vida!

Si un insecto que chupa sangre, pica a una persona con VIH, el virus muere inmediatamente en el estómago del insecto (a medida que digiere la sangre). El VIH sólo puede vivir en las células humanas.<br>  Los mosquitos no pueden transmitir el VIH por dos motivos:<br>  <br>     1. El mosquito chupa sangre e inyecta saliva. La sangre de una persona no es inyectada en la siguiente víctima del mosquito.<br>     2. El VIH muere inmediatamente en el cuerpo del mosquito. La gente se confunde porque la malaria se reproduce en el aparato digestivo del mosquito, usando al mosquito como parte de su ciclo de vida. El VIH no lo hace.<br>  <br>  Estos hechos se confirman al ver los patrones de infección. En zonas donde los mosquitos son comunes y donde prevalece el VIH, el número de casos de SIDA en esas poblaciones no difiere del de otras zonas.

Se llama Síndrome de Inmunodeficiencia adquirida, y deberías tener síntomas o signos de enfermedad.  Si hay transmisión de fluídos corporales, lo que puede existir es la transmisión del virus del HIV, que según relatas, no me hace pensar que lo puedas llegar a tener.

Usa siempre bastante lubricante en el ano y en el preservativo. Y por más que estés con una pareja estable hace quichicientos a?os y esté confirmadísimo que no están infectados, siempre usa condón para este tipo de experiencias, ya que de lo contrario podría resultar en otro tipo de infecciones y enfermedades que quizás desconocías, posiblemente no tan graves, pero te ahorrarán varios dolores de cabeza.<br>  <br>  Ahora, lo de la saliva. Depende, obvio.<br>  El que tiene más peligro en este caso es el que "chupa". Si el receptor estaba infectado y con algún tipo de herida en su ano, y se les pasó la lengua y tenía microheridas, llagas, etc., pudo haber infección para el lengüeteador(?).<br>  En el caso opuesto, si el infectado era el que pasaba la lengua, las posibilidades son menores incluso, a menos que hubiera tenido, por supuesto heridas en su boca, y el otro en su ano.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eso es todo.<br>  SIn embargo, ten en cuenta que siempre debes protegerte por más que te digan que no tienen VIH y tú les creas, ya que pueden estar infectados y ni ellos mismos saberlo.<br>  <br>  Adiós, y cuídate.

Si las fibras o los materiales con los que esta hecho la mayoría del mobiliario domestico (alfombras, cortinas, muebles rellenos, ropa de cama y otros) se reemplazan con materiales sintéticos ( Nylon, acetato, poliéster, etc.) no biodegradables, se eliminan muchas de las fuentes de polvo doméstico.<br>  <br>  Recámara : <br>  A causa de que se está en la recámara una buena parte de cada 24 horas, el control del polvo en esta área  debe ser más estricto.<br>  a. Deshacerse de los muebles rellenos o tapizados.<br>  b. Los muebles deben tener acabados lisos de plástico, metal o madera.<br>  c. Sacar de la habitación y del armario contiguo todos los libros, juguetes, ropa, ropa de cama y otros, que producen polvo y lo acumulan. Si se guardan estos artículos en la recámara, se les debe meter en bolsas de plástico selladas.<br>  d. Los pisos de madera o baldosa desnudos son mejores; si fuera necesaria una alfombra, son mejores las que se quitan para lavarlas. La alfombra  debe de ser 100% sintética y el bajo alfombra  de hule espuma o goma.<br>  e. Las cortinas deben de ser fáciles de lavar  y de material sintético, aún cuando el algodón  es permisible.<br>  f. Se deben clausurar los tubos del radiador  de aire a presión  que den a la recámara o cambiarles frecuentemente un filtro de poliéster durante los meses de invierno.<br>  g. La ropa de cama debe ser de material sintético y se le debe  lavar con frecuencia. Evite las almohadas rellenas de plumas o miraguano. Los colchones  y colchonetas se deben cubrir con una funda para colchón de vinyl con cierre. ( Se Consiguen en la mayoría de las grandes tiendas departamentales.) <br>  h. Las ventanas y puertas que dan a la recámara deben permanecer cerradas el mayor tiempo posible.<br>  i. Se debe lavar las paredes, techos  y  pisos. Es importante la limpieza diaria con un trapeador y trapo húmedos.<br>  j. Las aspiradoras esparcen grandes cantidades de partículas de polvo en el aire; por lo tanto, es mejor que la persona alérgica salga de casa mientras se usa la aspiradora, y cuando menos durante dos horas después. Si la persona alérgica utiliza la aspiradora debe usar una máscara protectora alérgena.<br>  <br>  Asuntos especiales:<br>  <br>  a. Las mascotas, con pelos o plumas, NO deben estar en casa en ningún momento.<br>  b. No debe haber plantas domésticas en la recámara; la tierra contiene moho y material biodegradable que puede ser muy alergénico.<br>  c. El Moho (a?ublo  hongos)se asocia con lugares húmedos y se le puede eliminar  o retrazar disminuyendo la humedad por medio de ventiladores, calentadores y otros, y usando retardadores de moho como Captan (ortofungicida) ( lo puede comprar en un vivero local. El Zephiran ( cloruro de Benzalconio) 1:750, se compra en las farmacias.<br>  También se pueden usar otros retardadores de moho disponibles en el mercado como Lysol. El Captan no es venenoso  para los humanos y se puede usar en aspersión con un aspersor para jardín, use ocho cucharadas de solución al 25 % o cuatro cucharadas de polvo al 50% en 3.8 l de agua ( Un Galón. El Zephiran (concentrado)se puede rociar en las paredes y otros lugares.<br>  d. Los Limpiadores o purificadores de aire son muy útiles. Las unidades portátiles se deben de colocar en la recamara en un lugar donde  el crucé de aire limpio cruce la cabecera de la cama. También venden unidades más grandes que se incorporan a su sistema de calefacción de aire a presión. Hay dos tipos de limpiadores de aire en el mercado, parecen funcionar bien, pero se considera que el filtro HEPA es más eficiente. Puede rentar un limpiador de aire para evaluar su utilidad. La cuota del alquiler suele ser aplicable al precio de venta.<br>  e. El humo del cigarro es un irritante del sistema respiratorio y no se debe permitir fumar en casa.<br>  <br>   3. Los esteroides nasales son un tratamiento impresionante  para la rinitis alérgica. Se les debe usar diario  ya que su beneficio se deriva de la supresión de la respuesta alérgica inflamatoria a largo y corto plazo. Todos los esteroides nasales tienen una eficacia similar. Al parecer los esteroides nasales más recientes tienen pocos efectos secundarios, es decir , irritación nasal y hemorragia , y a menudo requieren solo una administración diaria.<br>  4.- La irrigación nasal con un aparato  eléctrico para la higiene bucal ( waterpik). Existen accesorios para la irrigación nasal con este aparato, Los tres adaptadores nasales disponibles comercialmente son :<br>  <br>  a) El adaptador nasal Ethicare hecho por Ethicare  products, P.O. Box 5027, Fort Lauderdale, Fl 33310 telefono (954) 7423599.<br>  b) El Adaptador nasal Grossan hecho por HydroMed Inc.., P.O. Box 591273, Los Angeles, CA 90009. telefono (800) 560-9007.<br>  c) El irrigador nasal de Anthony Products (API), 771 Records  Street, Indianápolis ,IN 46226 Teléfono (800) 428-1610.<br>  <br>  Llene el recipiente con volumen de 500ml de agua tibia. Muchos prefieren la temperatura  del agua igual a al temperatura corporal, otros la prefieren un poco más fría. El agua simple hierve igual que la solucion salina hipertónica. En General se agregan una, dos o cuando mucho tres cucharaditas de sal a los 500ml de  agua del  grifo. La mayoría de los pacientes lo hacen  con una sola cucharadita. El control de la presión se deberá de colocar en la presión más baja  y el paciente se inclina sobre el lavabo sosteniendo el adaptador nasal primero en una fosa nasal  y luego en la otra. Se Irriga cada cavidad nasal. A veces el agua corre hacia la faringe y sale por la boca, y a veces sale por la fosa nasal contraria. Se irriga cada cámara nasal hasta que quede limpia. Algunos pacientes utilizan 250ml para irrigar un lado y 250ml para irrigar el otro. Otros alternan uno y otro  usando de 50 a 100 ml por vez, en cada lado. La mayoría de la gente se beneficia con dos irrigaciones diarias. Mucha lo hace una vez al día y poca lo hace tres, cuatro o hasta más veces al día. Nuestra recomendación  es empezar con dos irrigaciones diarias y luego ajustarlas y modificarlas a su comodidad y beneficio.|`|f824faddf8d162815b576e30b09f66edaa	No fumar ni dejar que fumen a tu alrededor.

wkQTVPydaa	It is possible for anyone to gain muscle as long as you provide your body with  the proper food,vitamins, minerals,training,and rest to establish an anabolic environment that will cause your muscles to have to grow.  As long as you go to the gym, train your muscles  with progressively heavier weights each week and eat at least 175 grams of protein per day (given your weight) you should have no problems seeing muscle gains within a few weeks. I suggest checking out teenbodybuilding.com for more muscle and fitness tips aimed at people in your age group , it is a great reference site. good luck and GET HUGE.|`|gCKmYPIuaa	yeah it should be possible. You can build muscle at your age.|`|pYQ8CiBVaa	To gain weight you have to eat more calories than you burn. When adding calories, try to stay away from adding too much fat. While you can get fat from eating carbohydrates or protein, your body likes to use carbohydrates as fuel more than fat. To gain muscle, in addition to eating more you have to stimulate your muscles enough through resistance training that while they recover, they'll get bigger and stronger. To get an efficient workout you might want to join a gym if you aren't already a member.<br>  <br>  Guide to Gaining Weight - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/gainweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...</a><br>  Health, Exercise and Diets - <a href="http://straighthealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com</a>|`|a2ac46fe59ee0ba866312e831350dbeeaa	yes, of course it is.  To build muscle size, lift a weight heavy enough that the maximum number of reps per set you can do is 8.  Try for three sets.  If you cannot do the exercise with good form, the weight is too heavy.<br>  <br>  Do not work the same muscle group on consequtive days.  I generally try for an upper/ lower split on alternate days.<br>  <br>  make sure you are consuming enough calories, and enough protein.<br>  <br>  Don't do too much cardio while you are trying to bulk up... too much ( more than 1/2 hour 3 days a week) will actually "eat" your muscle stores.

Después de un episodio de varicela, el virus se vuelve latente en el cuerpo y el herpes zóster ocurre como resultado de la reaparición del virus después de muchos a?os.<br>  <br>  La causa de la reactivación generalmente se desconoce, pero parece estar asociada con el envejecimiento, situaciones de estrés o alteraciones del sistema inmunitario. Usualmente sólo se presenta un ataque sin recaídas.

El ano, al igual que la vagina, tiene terminaciones nerviosas sensibles. Tanto los hombres como las mujeres heterosexuales, aunque a veces creen que estas inclinaciones indican una tendencia homosexual, a menudo disfrutan con algún tipo de masaje anal. Algunos hombres y mujeres consideran que la práctica del coito anal es algo aventurero y divertido, mientras que otros lo miran como algo sucio, perverso y doloroso.<br>  <br>  Esta práctica sexual requiere grandes dosis de mutua confianza, lubricación, capacidad de comunicación y paciencia por parte del hombre, que no puede moverse tan enérgicamente como lo haría durante el coito vaginal porque corre el riesgo de da?ar tejidos muy delicados. El coito anal es una actividad de alto riesgo debido a la infección VIH.<br>  <br>  La sumisión física y psicológica que conlleva esta práctica, tiene para muchos hombres y mujeres un gran atractivo como alternativa ocasional al coito vaginal. En realidad, la mujer debería controlar el ritmo y la profundidad de la penetración. Como debe ocurrir en cualquier práctica sexual, nadie debe sentirse obligado a practicar el coito anal sólo porque su pareja se lo pida. El sexo para ser placentero siempre tiene que ser elegido.<br>  <br>  El recto no está dise?ado para la práctica del sexo y no puede soportar repentinos encuentros sexuales sin sufrir da?os. Aunque los dos componentes de la pareja gocen, el coito es un acontecimiento especial. Con un poco de creatividad, ambos pueden quedar satisfechos.<br>  <br>  Técnica Sexual.<br>  Cuando se vaya a realizar la penetración anal ha que tener en cuenta que:<br>  <br>  Por tratarse de un esfínter muscular tiende a ofrecer resistencias por lo cual debe procurarse una buena relajación corporal.<br>  <br>  Como, a diferencia de la vagina, no se auto lubrica, deberá ser utilizada una crema o gel lubricante no irritante, para tal fin, tanto en el pené o dedo como en el ano.<br>  <br>  Realizar la penetración de manera cuidadosa y suave, paulatina (a veces es conveniente dilatar primero con un dedo antes de la introducción del pené), retirándose si la compa?era, o compa?ero, refiere un dolor intenso que no tolera o si hay fuerte resistencia, o sencillamente si no le agrada.<br>  <br>  El uso del condón es muy importante pues la mucosa rectal es una vía de entrada de virus y bacterias.<br>  <br>  Jamás realizar una penetración vaginal luego de la anal, ya que se corre el peligro de contaminar la vagina con flora bacteriana proveniente del recto y que el pené llevaría consigo; de querer hacerse debería usarse otro condón o, en caso de no usarlo, efectuar una higiene cuidadosa.<br>  <br>  Nunca penetrar contra la voluntad de la pareja.<br>  <br>  En ocasiones hay resistencias o negativas a hacerlo por el dolor, otras por preceptos morales o religiosos, o porque no resulta placentero. Una de las causas de disgusto, en ambos, puede ser la presencia de materia fecal al retirar el pené. <br>  <br>  Para muchas parejas heterosexuales el sexo anal puede ser una alternativa que produzca grandes satisfacciones eróticas y sexuales. No obstante, debido sobre todo a que se le ha considerado un "tabú", son muchas las preguntas que genera y algunas las precauciones que exige. Saberlas nunca está de más.<br>  <br>  Las opiniones acerca del sexo anal son muchas y variadas, e incluso encontradas y contradictorias. No todo el mundo acepta (sobre todo por razones éticas y religiosas) que este tipo de relación sea "normal" en una pareja heterosexual, pero lo cierto es que muchas personas ven en el coito anal una manera como cualquier otra de disfrutar del sexo, un equivalente al oral o al vaginal. No obstante, el clima de ocultación, la presión de los prejuicios y el hecho de que el tema haya sido considerado un tabú ha ocasionado que en cuanto al sexo anal todo sean preguntas, dudas y silencio. Buscarles respuesta es la mejor manera de acabar con los riesgos innecesarios y los problemas derivados de la ignorancia. Porque el sexo anal también exige sus propias precauciones.<br>  <br>  Precauciones.<br>  Entre las medidas preventivas más evidentes, existe la del preservativo. Aunque su uso está extendido en las relaciones de tipo vaginal (todo el mundo conoce los riesgos que comporta no usarlo, Sida y enfermedades de transmisión sexual), no sucede lo mismo en cuanto al anal. No obstante es necesario usar preservativo como prevención contra la enfermedad del SIDA: ya que el VIH se transmite fácilmente por una zona que carece de lubricación natural y que, por tanto, es más propensa a los desgarres y lesiones sangrantes que, al mezclarse con un semen infectado contribuyen a extender la enfermedad.<br>  <br>  A ello, sería recomendable a?adir otras precauciones que nunca deben parecer innecesarias. La más importante: tras haber practicado el sexo anal no debe pasarse NUNCA al sexo vaginal directamente. Es necesario tomas medidas de higiene, como lavarse el pene (o el dedo si éste también ha intervenido en la penetración), también es necesario cambiar el preservativo, ya que en el ano hay bacterias que, aquí puede que no ocasionen problemas pero si puede hacerlo en la vagina.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, no está de más tener en cuenta como medida la necesidad de que el hombre no sea brusco con su pareja que, para poder ser penetrada, debe estar muy excitada o excitado si en su caso se trata de una pareja homosexual. Si no se la excita adecuadamente, sobre todo en el esfínter anal, le puede resultar doloroso y molesto además de provocarle desgarres y lesiones importantes. Por este motivo, un lubricante artificial (con base acuosa, vaselina y aceites puede perjudicar al látex del preservativo) puede resultar de ayuda para facilitar la penetración que, por sí sola, no es sencilla. Si además la pareja estimula manualmente la zona para así dilatar el esfínter anal esta práctica no tiene porque resultar dolorosa.<br>  <br>  Una última precaución, ya repetida seguramente, es la HIGIENE. Es evidente que para que todo resulte ameno y placentero la persona penetrada debe haber evacuado antes para que la última parte del colon esté lo más limpia posible y no haya dificultades en la penetración. Finalmente, un lavado concentrado en la zona nunca está demás.|`|AA10160033	Pues por experiencia con mi pareja la respuesta es: de perrito y  mucho lubricante, pero más paciencia tuya para no lastimarla y recuerda ella dirige la penetración.|`|L449oihlaa	no crean todo lo que ven en las peliculas xxx estas chicas toman medicamentos para que se les dilate el ano o sea se les haga lo mas grande como para que puedan penetrarlo a demas utilizan aceites para aplicar al rededor de el. si lo van a hacer traten de usar condo para no contraer infeccion con el escremento.

Lift up bags of sugar/flour things like that, but be careful not to lift too heavy things to begin with, you might strain your back.
mVpVzodEaa	its weird, im like that too. like when im with my friends everything is good and im perfectly fine but when i come home i snap at my family even when i dont mean to or want to. I think its maybe a combo of stress and mild depression.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	People who are bipolar go back and forth between feeling like they just won the lottery (when they didn't) and being suicidal enough to act on it.  What you're describing sounds more like frustration and an immature reaction.  If you were depressed, you wouldn't care.|`|wlaEnkc9aa	No you aren't bipolar because you would be happy for longer then a second it could last for years and the depression as well. But for depression I don't think so either, you are just showing signs of anger not depression and puberty I'm mad around my parents and not my friends|`|B91DUxNraa	I'm fine with my friends, but my family drives me nuts. It depends it your family does something to annoy you or if they aren't doing anything then you start screaming. That's bipolar. Otherwise, you're fine. :)|`|aJGAXYUIaa	both|`|1XCFEmp4aa	nah if your fine with friends then your ok.
klu1sCpraa	It's way easier to get your toes to curl upward then you don't have so far to reach
8qs1l3zVaa	poor circulation does that.. its a muscle spasming that's how you feel a pop..try drinking water...  sitting in a postion that doesnt put strain on the foot..and don't get worked up and stressed out that would make your feet curl and cause cramps|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	walk it out.  keep your feet warm.|`|eW5D8rKPaa	OMG!<br>  I get those too.<br>  Just try to keep your foot straight. <br>  When the cramp happens hold on to your foot and rub it.<br>  REMEMBER.<br>  KEEP YOUR FOOT STRAIGHT.<br>  cus doesnt it feel like it curls?<br>  well mine does.<br>  =) get better!<br>  OR<br>  maybe see a foot docter.|`|yXJW5fc7aa	my mom always told me i get those cause im lacking....something...forgot what its called...but she says to eat bananas and that really helps
1hS1pQz5aa	Naw, that doesn't count. It only counts if you bleed or it leaves a mark.|`|uvOhOUllaa	nope, in all technicality it's not cutting unless you bleed out. especially if you didn't even leave a mark, it's definitely not.|`|pfaddytkaa	Nah that's not considered cutting but be sure that you don't take things further. You don't want to get into cutting, please be safe|`|5wkeQLERaa	no thats not cutting|`|PS9JIKR7aa	see a doctor please, and stop listening to mcr, that might help :)|`|hBmafVYoaa	It's not about what is counted! This sounds a little attention seeking. You need to get some help. Please don't see cutting as something that you need to excel at. It's serious.|`|xLO5VRYTaa	no but ahhhhhh the thought of cutting ahhhhhhhhhhhhh its seriously like nails to a chalkboard for me! every since my cousin tripped with scissors and it cut his wrist and just missed the artery i've had like an ocd about getting cut on the wrist!

Read Links Below.|`|nOU8WvmDaa	yes they could grow up to five inches but at the same rate they grow when your alive|`|56vmjlGDaa	b|`|3vWpUXsmaa	Your cousin is correct about the fingernail part. When you die your hair and nails continue to grow. However, they don't put you in a big bag to catch your excrement, whatever is left inside you is flushed out while being embalmed.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	yea your fingernails and hair grow idk how much but i know once you die you do poop but the drain everything out of your body they dont put you in a bag l0l|`|SHoIWZ56aa	fingernail is true but prolly not 5 inches<br>  and the poop thing i dunno <br>  no offense how old are you? 9 yr olds are prolly not the best sources|`|9tMNpFmEaa	no. It's clearly 6.|`|AA11314631	Because of the fact that your nails are basically dead already, they do feed off of the nutrients that is still left in your body after you die.  If you look at old bodies that Scientists have unearthed, you will see that their nails have grown just because of this.. It is a natural occurance.<br>  <br>  A great description of this is the "Buried in Ice" photos of people that Scientist's have discovered.  <br>  <br>  One example: <br>  <a href="http://www.packaginganddesign.com/printing/video%20sleeves/Video%20Sleeve%20Scans/Congress%20Entertainment/Buried%20In%20Ice.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.packaginganddesign.com/printi...</a>|`|n8Xk9dlzaa	Umm im not quite sure about the nails...<br>  That sounds really weird since you should be decomposing after you die.<br>  But when you die your body completely relaxes so you do actually get rid of any access urine or fecal matter.<br>  I know its gross but that happens right after you die.<br>  They shouldnt have to keep you in a bag... Lol|`|MuzqSYjwaa	The fingernails thing is just stupid.  NO that doesn't happen.  When someone dies it is very common that the muscles in their body relax, and YES they poop.  This happens before they can be put in a big bag or anything else.|`|iy8C03vaaa	i dont know about the poop thing but i know that after you die your hair and finger nails continue to grow for a short time...i dont think its a whole 5 inches, its pry only a couple centimeters or something...|`|E7TzD7s2aa	i believe  that it is not true. after you die your body shuts down. and for our fingernails to grow we need our body running. so..no =) hope i helped.|`|tk4PLUvnaa	It's false, your fingernails grow until they rot.|`|91M9ebuWaa	Well...<br>  isnt every poop just leftovers?|`|ArKT9O7Maa	No. It isn't.  You 9 year old cousin is a superstitious idiot.  The cells in your fingernail die when you do.  This is because you eat the food that gives them energy.  I assume that you currently don't understand that this happens, I am not going to explain to your further, or your brain might explode.<br>  And it is true that when you die you empty your bowels, but they don't put you in a bag because of it.|`|1w6m03RNaa	when you die you do poop because your muscles get relaxed so it all comes out I do not know if they put people in bags but that would be a good idea. I really do not think your fingernails grow 5 inches because your heart cannot supply the cells with energy and oxygen.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	No.  When a person dies, their heart stops beating (duh!).  Without blood flow, the hair cant grow, and neither can the nails.<br>  <br>  That's what you get when you listen to your 9 year old cousin's friend..<br>  <br>  Sounds like somebody needs to put a bag under HER, to catch all the b.s. that SHE is putting out!!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  SOOO MANY OF YOU ARE SOO FULL OF CRAP!  YOUR HAIR AND NAILS do not (!) CONTINUE TO GROW!<br>  Do you realize how foolish that is to say they do?<br>  Here is a link, if you still dont believe me:<br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/science/nailgrow.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/science/nailgrow.a...</a>|`|IwQa2zkEaa	After you die, both your finger nails and your hair never stop growing.<br>  <br>  I was told this when I visited a mummy exhibit in a Toronto museum, and it was very apparent on one of the mummys who had been preserved.<br>  <br>  Cool huh?|`|eDbyJp2iaa	It's a misconception. After you die, believe it or not, your skin kinda shrinks or shrivels up a bit. So your hair and nails appear to have "grown".  Even so, its a matter of millimeters, and not 5 inches.|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	No there is a rumor that your hair and nails grow. This is untrue. The skin shrinks making it appear that way. The big bag is not just to catch the leaking of bodily fluids but to protect the body as well. Good luck.|`|uYDoPNv9aa	im not sure about that.<br>  in ways it may be true but then your nails grow and you only digestive when you eat and have your daily vitamins.

But finger nails growing? no because your body just completely dies.|`|oULIbae9aa	yes ur hair and finger nails continue to grow even when ur dead but i'm not sure how long the grow or weither they curl up.|`|b1NMh5K2aa	Im not sure but i do know when you die your bowls relax and you poo yourself|`|6H9q2VEBaa	she's 9 years old no it's not true and that is so disgusting!|`|AzME6jxNaa	no its not true my dad's a mortician|`|d9DY4IYCaa	umm... sure|`|odc3Y1edaa	umm im gunna say false to the nail thing|`|9JCMVvFKaa	Your body goes through a state of extreme tension and than a sudden relaxation when you die. you lose all control of your bowl movements and you basically crap yourself. The finger nail thing is also true you nails keep growing because they don't need any vital life signs to live. And because of the access energy the body has left after you die your nails use that up quickly and grow<br>  <br>  Weird i know|`|WALqrcr0aa	No that not true, when you die you body stops growing and stuff. They only put you in a bag to cover you up if they have to move you. But once they get to the hospital they clean out you body, including poop so it dose not stink when they barry u.|`|L2UEI99Baa	yes,<br>  <br>  your fingernails and hair<br>  continue to grow after<br>  your death <br>  <br>  but<br>  <br>  as for sh*tin urself<br>  im not sure<br>  i dont think so though|`|4312a05a5c516ed5d819dac35863d3e1aa	haha no how could it when you die your body stops to work so therefore der is no blood going to you body thus they not growing!!|`|BZheNWRjaa	uumm i dont think so...<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227150504AAifLVB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|41wwraeXaa	Your finger nails will grow a few millimeters, not much.

gs8MSMs3aa	omg that is so awful i think it prolly would make someone really queasy but other than that i dont see there being much pain involved|`|24kFbAdsaa	Mine big toe never hurt at all as long as I didn't play with it.  When it gets loose, tape it to your toe until it's ready to fall off by itself.  When it starts to grow back, again, don't play with it, but protect it.  Be careful when you put on socks; could snag and cause pain.  That 's why you want to tape it.  A doctor's visit would be good to help prevent infections.|`|hTD6wSfZaa	Well first of all charlie. The best remedy that i found was to like your toe it helps a lot espcially if you put lime and salt on it. PS: Don't forget the chlie powder.|`|AA12072840	When your toenail falls off, your toe will be a little tender so it would be good to stay away from people stepping on your feet. Then your toenail should grow back within 3 months. :)|`|XF2vVY3Uaa	It feels funny. Keep it uncovered it may feel better that way. try a band aid while it grows it may help. Doesnt hurt or anything.|`|Yy6P1JAwaa	Its going to hurt like hell.|`|JKPZPCMYaa	I just had the same thing happen from a game of flag football, and mine didn't hurt at all! Keep an eye on it b/c if it has blood trapped underneath it might need to be lanced or it will hurt. I wound up cutting mine off a little at a time as it was dying (which didn't hurt...it will start to turn yellow). A new one started to grow right away, and it tripped me out b/c I expected it to grow from the bottom up, but it was a real thin cover over the entire toe! Now that it's on, it's a little tender to the touch, but nothing big. Hope that helps!|`|icfI36gvaa	this happened to me. it was annoying and i got a fake nail put on it when it fell off bc it was summer. it got blue on like january and didn't fall off until may and then didn't grow back until like 6 months later
rZHaYIssaa	First off, picture what your life would be like with that better, hotter body. Think of how amazing you would feel.<br>  <br>  There's no excuse not to exercise. Period. <br>  <br>  "I don't have time"<br>  If you have time for t.v. you have time to exercise. Just 5 minutes makes a difference.<br>  <br>  "I have lost my concentration" or "I'm tired" <br>  Exercise creates a chemical called endorphins, these are body's natural drugs- I'm not kidding, it's a natural "high". When your brain releases them (which is when you exercise) your mood instantly lifts up, your concentration is better and surprisingly, you have more energy. Is could just be 5 minutes of a brisk walk and things instantly seem better.<br>  <br>  If you can't motivate yourself, no one else can but you. You're the only one in charge here, you're in this by yourself - this is YOU making you're own decisions. This is just about you and if you want a time to change now would be a good time to do so. Stop waiting and start making things happen.|`|zWagsiIeaa	Girls, Movies, Music, Pics of yourself from one standpoint to another. Goals, what are they, think about it.|`|o9t58FKfaa	yes...look at someone will your goal body. by seeing the abs/arms/legs you want, it will help motivate you b.c u see what the results will be when you work out for a few weeks!<br>  <br>  Good luck! :-)
HHPha1J0aa	Ouch sorry to hear about your thumb<br>  If it is very painful then you could take parecetamol or aspirin but only take it if you really need to.<br>  <br>  Applying a cold compress on the area is another option it should help ease the pain, its good that you've tapped it to your index finger at least it will support it<br>  <br>  Try not to touch or bend it if you can if it dosent get any better then i'd see your doctor who may be able to helpx and give you something for it.|`|dBPCT41kaa	Ice it and take Tylonel or motrin|`|Ybu2E2OWaa	you should untape it this could make it worse. all you can really do is ice it and take pain killers.

It could be a variety of things....I had both small toes on each foot start hurting and swelling on Monday. Went to the doc Wednesday couldn't take it any more and she thinks its gout.  If its an infection you will probably get a fever soon.  try to stay off it for now, if it gets worse get to the doc.

Could also possibly be due to a vitamin deficiency.  Do you itch in any other place?  Does the skin become red and inflamed when you get this sensation?  Honestly, I think you should go to a podiatrist or primary care provider for a definite diagnosis.|`|cwIPdttEaa	Well i think you should le it be for a little while unless you already have then i guess you should call your docter and explain your issue.(thanks  for answering my question )|`|3T994QRnaa	i think a spider has crawled into your toe, no i think it might just be a muscle spasm if it feels like there is blood pumping

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	The recommended upper limit for a 24 hour period is 240 mg, but you would get 360 mg if you took 2 pills every 4 hours.   The amount of codeine in each pill is 30mg, so you can take 8 pills in 24 hours if you don't want to exceed 240mg, or 12 if you want to stay under the 360mg limit.|`|9ydlIWUNaa	you might be taking too much<br>  all i know is that if you take more than 5 pills with something like tylenol, it could be lethal- pretty dangerous.<br>  erm, i'd say take one or two every 5 hours, depending on the pain and the dosage of the penicilin and the mouthwash.|`|nIkFQfE2aa	The max should be 12. That with you taking 2 every 4 hours. Try to stay around this amount because if you take too many then they could make you sick to your stomach. Just relax and use an ice pack on your mouth it will help soooo much!!|`|XH4O3ozFaa	You got Tylenol, caffiene and codiene which is a mild pain reliever but taking more then 8 a day for a week the the tylenol will hurt your stomach and liver.|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	take the minimum amount possible.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	You should not be taking them any sooner than every 4 hours!  Take no more than a daily maximum of  6. This medication has acetaminophen in it. (The same ingredient as in tylenol) Too much of it can cause liver damage. Take 1 tablet every 4 hours only if you need it.  If one tablet does not ease your pain, then take two the next time you are due to take something. But again, only take it if you need it to avoid getting addicted to the codeine. Hopefully, after the first couple of days, you could switch to an over-the-counter product and not have to use the prescription.

You don't want a protein deficiency!<br>  Eating a well balanced diet of whole grains, nuts, berries, fruits, vegetables and fish will help. Also if you don't drink milk you need to get your calcium from somewhere, I suggest a supplement or soymilk.<br>  Take a vitamin supplement too, one that has no additives. <br>  Good luck!|`|Tz0FOMrjaa	you're doing ok as it is keep going the way you are and you'll start seeing results soon.<br>  Good Luck|`|VmE0jG0Eaa	There's no such thing as a completely healthy vegetarian diet.  People are omnivores, which includes meat, for a reason.  Good luck getting your daily requirement of trypsin and arginine without meat.<br>  <br>  Also, fish is meat. It's an animal.  Just because it isn't a "cute" animal, doesn't mean it doesn't count. Fish contains far more bacteria and parasite than any other animal.  Everything contains steroids, even plants.  You're not a vegetarian.
8SRjELNBaa	For the sake of your heart, stress levels or clogged arteries, you should force down the vegetables. Lettuce has a low calorie density number.  Meaning that you will be full for very low cals, assuming you don't drench it in fatty dressing and pounds of cheese on top.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	The lettuce isn't your problem.  You need to cut out the hamburgers and tacos.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to eat vegetables, then you need to pick up a copy of the Atkinson Diet and follow that for a while.  You don't eat carbohydrates but you can pretty much eat all the meat you want.  You can't have any bread or anything with sugar, or pretty much anything EXCEPT meat.<br>  <br>  But it does work (although most people can't stay on it for lack of variety) and if you don't want to go with veggies that's about your best bet.<br>  <br>  You need to consult with your physician before starting any diet regimen since you already know you have a blood pressure problem.
AA10478980	No, but it may improve your posture, which will make you appear taller.
df33eaa9d9fa77a930c76a56de1aa68aaa	Yeah!  It'll make your short hairs turn blue and fall out!|`|AA11476749	Since it hasn't been prescribed for you, you take a risk of enduring the side effects.<br>  <br>  One of these is priapism, in which the erection lasts longer than four hours.  It is a medical emergency, and must be treated quickly.  Blindness is another risk that you take, not having been prescribed the medication.|`|AA10229962	Won't make it any longer than it really is, it'll just make you have a hardon even easier than you already do.... You'll probably get an erection that won't go away no matter what, even after you jack off or get laid.<br>  <br>  It probably won't hurt you, but if you get an erection and it will NOT go away after four hours, you're going to have to go to the hospital. That will NOT be fun, because they will use a huge hypodermic needle to suck the clogged up blood out of your penis. With no anesthesia.<br>  <br>  Seriously.|`|RSBufJHUaa	Typical know nothing kid.  One does not EAT Viagra. It's a pill, so one TAKES Viagra.<br>  Viagra is ONLY for those MEN who have difficulty in obtaining/maintaining an erection and should only be used if it is PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN.  It does NOT make your penis longer/thicker.  I doubt you took one and I doubt DADDY left one laying on his shelf.   They run $12 - $15 each so I bet your step-dad has a count.  <br>  Quit telling lies and go back playing with your GI Joe and Barbie dolls little boy.<br>  Thanks for the big laugh at your expense.|`|0y6hw5c4aa	Okay, why are you eating it ?<br>  It's not meant for eating. <br>  Stop eating it before something serious happens to you.<br>  Those types of pills have serious side-effects, and it could end up making you have a low-sperm count in the future.<br>  Plus, your 16. <br>  Those pills are meant for full-grown adults.<br>  Please stop taking them asap.|`|khgwEYfQaa	are you mad?<br>  ?|`|vw4KXRlLaa	Best case scenario is you'll be stuck running around with an erection for several hours.  Worst case scenario you can suffer from priapism, an erection lasting for longer than 4 hours, which needs immediate medical attention and can cause permanent damage to your penis.|`|S16zxuonaa	dude i totally get where you're coming from...Viagra is delicious. i popped like 19 Viagra the other day and my dick reached 3 inches!|`|IR5FUNlkaa	you're a twat! seriously, at 16 you're crazy full of hormones anyway so why'd u need viagra???|`|AxgTvpjSaa	yes this can increase your heart rate pumping excess blood into your system do not take any thing that is not prescribed by a doctor with out researching it first .

BChEQB1Xaa	Your 16, I stopped growing when I was about 15/16 years old (i'm 5ft5) it depends on how tall your family are... If they are all very tall then chances are you will be too.. You're around the age that your growth will start to slow down. So you may grow another inch or two, but i'm guessing not much more. Although you can never be completely accurate with something like that. As for your diet, just eat healthily, and don't worry about height!|`|sTwAwLq4aa	What you eat is just the fuel to the fire but it wont necessarily make you grow, your body is in charge and no matter what you want some stuff happens, you cant stop it. Dont stop eating healthy though|`|PxohEvTvaa	You may or may not be done growing..<br>  You didn't provide enough info.. How tall are your parents?<br>  Thats the best way to determine height.|`|UNRWJZOmaa	well you sprout up in your teens and that is probably your max height now.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Be proud of your height because tall girls get noticed by boys before short girls but be careful because the thinner you become the taller you will look|`|O059Wvqxaa	nothing helps you grow its in your genes.<br>  don't worry about it girls stop growing between 12 and 19 so you don't have long to go.<br>  <br>  im 15 and 5ft3 and stop growing when i was 12 so everyone is different. being small is not that good either lol :)
wwRbkCMraa	Whey protein is safe and is already in many of the things you are probably eating daily. Did u know it's in Cheeze it crackers, candy bars, pop tarts and many other foods, including almost all dairy products like yogurt, milk, cheese etc. Baby food has whey protein, The protein in milk is 20% whey, so whey in its concentrated form should be perfectly fine at any age as long as you are not lactose intolerant.  Next time you are at the store look at the label on some baby formula.  Even that has whey protein in it.  Start reading labels and you will see many foods that contain whey, and are safe at any age. Whey is a naturally occurring protein in dairy and it has a lot of health benefits even if you don't workout.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?topic=95.0" rel="nofollow">http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?t...</a> <br>  <a href="http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?topic=80.0" rel="nofollow">http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?t...</a> <br>  <a href="http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?topic=73.0" rel="nofollow">http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?t...</a>|`|mTFfFZCnaa	Since Whey is derived from milk, lactose intolerant people might develop allergic reaction.Allergic reaction caused by intolerance to lactose- The most common known side effects of whey are linked to people who are lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is the difficulty of digesting lactose; form of sugar found in milk. The pH of blood increased- Excessive protein in the blood will give your kidney a hard time to metabolize it, in turn makes blood acidic.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It's protein why would it be bad for your kidneys.|`|KhvXdMpNaa	yes. your kindneys are allergic to it
LN2nIbeCaa	No type of tanning is "safe."  You increase your risk of skin cancer regardless of how much sun you get or don't get, or if you only use it twice per month.  If you feel that it's worth the risk, I guess go for it, but in my opinion, it is not.<br>  <br>  See a dermatologist about the acne problem.|`|FxSDpGnSaa	It is NEVER 'safe' to use sunbeds........in fact I think they should be banned.<br>  <br>  Yes a little bit of sun will help your skin, but you should only be using UV to treat this under MEDICAL supervision.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	You can go swimming while on your period, there is nothing you cannot do while on your period., although menstrual flow isn't toxic and there could certainly be worse things in the pool, it's not pleasant for other people to see your menstrual blood in the pool so you need proteciton.<br>  <br>  Tampons are the most common option but they are unhealthy and unhygienic so many women don't like using them, these can also leak and they have strings you have to hide under your swimsuit, but they are internal so discreet. You can use commercial tampons like Tampax, organic tampons like Cottons, soft tampons like Gynotex, cloth tampons or the best option may be sponges like Jade & Pearl <a href="http://www.jadeandpearl.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jadeandpearl.com</a> which don't have strings so more discreet than some other tampons, these are also slightly safer than commercial tampons.<br>  <br>  Pads can be used for swimming, but commercial pads like Always or organic pads like Cottons will go soggy in the water and come unstuck so use cloth pads or something similar, you can only use pads with light flow as when wet they can't hold as much, and just hide under a pair of shorts. Cloth pads like Lunapads <a href="http://www.lunapads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lunapads.com</a> won't come unstuck as they are held in place with poppers rather than glued in. You can use period belts like Reddy's <a href="http://www.reddyspads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddyspads.com</a> which are extra-long pads that fasten around your waste so more secure and easier to hide, better still are period panties like Lunapanties from Lunapads, these are underwear with pads built-in so better protection, easier to hide and more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Menstrual cups like Divacup <a href="http://www.divacup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.divacup.com</a> are the best option, these are internal bell-shaped cups, which are much healthier and more hygienic than tampons, as well as more comfortable, easier to use, convenient, and reliable. You can leave cups for up to 12 hours even before your period or during heavy days, so no having to change all the time and cups don't leak so no risk of embarrassment. There's nothing showing outside of your body so they are more discreet. You can use a diaphragm as a menstrual cup, or use softcups like Instead <a href="http://www.softcups.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.softcups.com</a> which are diaphragm-shaped so sit further up in your vagina, they work on the same idea as menstrual cups so have similar benefits, but they aren't as easy to use as menstrual cups. <br>  <br>  It's a myth that periods stop in water, it just seems that way as you don't bleed constantly so what small amount there is gets diluted by the water, but if you're heavy or if larger pieces of the uterus lining come out then people will notice, especially when you get out of the water. Vagina's don't have anything built in to detect water, and your uterus is inside you so it can't tell when you're in water to know to stop shedding. Imagine if water did stop periods, they'd stop in the shower, maybe we'd be able to stop periods by just going near water like by dipping our hands in water to trick our water-seeking-vagina's, and stores would sell pads that kept you wet rather than dry.|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	yeah you can. just use a tampon|`|kDvKc3npaa	Yes you just have to use a tampon, that's all.<br>  <br>  Have fun.=]|`|kknSPYxKaa	Yes, you can.<br>  When you have your period it is perfectly fine to go swimming, just make sure you have a tampon in.<br>  That is the only way you can, or else you will be swimming in red, and everyone around you will know that you have it.<br>  Talk to your mom about using a tampon.<br>  If she says no, you can't go swimming :/|`|svtrTIz3aa	As all answers said and as Melody said, i will say Yeah. use a tampon, make sure it's not going to leak while you're in the pool, everything's fine.

Yes you can, because when you're running around in water or swimming around, the flow of the water minimizes your period.  My friend told me that it stops her period when she's swimming.  No biggie, because it's not like it would drip around everywhere you swim.  It just flows less.|`|4312a05a5c516ed5d819dac35863d3e1aa	yeah no problem doing this at all - use a tampon obviously. make sure to put a new one before u go swimming.|`|UlENF48maa	Yuup, just use a tampon and you'll be fine. if you need help just ask a parent or an older girl you know, hope i helped :)|`|bhnPUzypaa	Yeah, just use a tampon and your good to go!<br>  xxx
bjqjkDMHaa	Swimming, pushups, weight training...those build muscles in the arms.

DOVbF4Piaa	It depends on portion size.|`|SgKsHxD5aa	you need more calories. the tea and water has 0 calories..<br>  <br>  if you get around 2,000 calories a day, yoiu burn almost all of them, and a few of them are stored as fat. however, if you get less than that, yourbody thinks your starving, and automatically turns ALL of the calories you eat into fat. so you are defeating the purpose by not eating enough|`|GdUnVFaxaa	Depends on how many meat balls and how much pasta, but I am assuming not much. I would say it is about 500 - 600 calories at most. It is not healthy to eat so little. To loose weight you don't go on eating to because you know you have to. Consider your weight. If you are at 120 pounds you Must have stored 1200 calories a day to maintain your weight, but this not include how much you burn through out a day so in reality you would only have about 500 calories left when you go to sleep at the end of the night. If you want to loose weight so badly, I would eat the bare minimum of calories according to your weight. Please do not go under 500 calories a day. You end up loosing muscle instead of fat. The fat will store up instead of be lost because your body is trying to keep up with so little intake. Go little by little to downsize your calorie intake.|`|fbHA13meaa	200+i dont know meat calories cuz im a vegetarian+30 unless the base of the garlic sauce is butter, how much pasta? a serving is like 150+0 water has none. <br>  probabblly like 400 but if u really want to loose some do what im doing, i became a vegetarian and i have had like 8 lbs lost in 2 weeks! i love it and i eata roughly 1500 calories a day with no cokkies and munchies and that stuff and no soda or gatorade or any of that.its been hardest to give up my iced carmel lattes from DunkinDs in the a.m.|`|QoxLuTqqaa	Tbh it could be anywhere between 550 - 1050 calories at a very rough guess... it does depend on portion size and content.

VKXNWcbGaa	Menny grose and discusting things happen when a person jumps off of a building.<br>  First of all, they would splatter. The bigger the mess depends on how high the building was. Every second  that you are falling your body increases its volocity by 32 feet.<br>  They jump off the building and start to fall. Then, if the building is really high they will increase speed, untill they hurrtle threw the air, perhaps even faster than a lambrgeenie. Then, thud, splat, they have hit the ground. Their leggs crush beeneeth them, all of their bones shatter and protude and peerce threw their skin and out of the body, looking like some bozar pin cushin. Their head hurttles down upon their neck, crushing all of the bones and vanes, making them bleed all over. The head hitts  the ground, making it explode like a blood-soaked  bomb. Gobets of brain, blood, icore, and brain fluid fly out and splatter everything in the area.<br>  They lie their, with only seconds to feel the pain, the agony, the littil spikes of torture shooting threw their nerves, and then die.<br>  Upon immpact, all you hear is a scream, then a thud, then menny loud cracks and splintering noises (as their bones shatter), and then, far in the distence you hear an ambellence, and a loud, high-frequency scream that chills you to the marrow of your bones. Aahh, the body comes hurtling out of the sky like a shooting arrow.  It falls, increasing speed with every second.  Not even wind can keep up with this high-speed date, with the ground.<br>  The poor soul falls screaming all the while.  Then, a sickening thud.  He hits the ground.  His bones shatter beneath him.  His head crushes upon his neck splinting the bones and vanes, making blood gush out of it as if it were a fossit.  His head (carried by the momentum and gravitational pull of his jump) smacks the ground, sounding like a "crack," as if a baseball had just made contact with a bat.  His head bursts open like an overripe watter mellon.  Blood and other fluids come poring out of his brain, and spatter everything around him.  Agonizing fiery pain courses through every single nerve of his body, making him rive and spazim, as if he were not a creature of this world.  Then, in a few seconds, it is over. <br>  His non-intact mouth hangs open, in supprise, in shock, in pain. His eyes stair in to the destence, wide as white marbles, lifliss, and not seeing. And, he dies, like a sputtering candle suddenly extingwished.   True, the blood, ichor and bone still remain, as well as the body.  But something has departed.  His essence, his soul is now forever gone, forever no more, forever still in torturous pain.|`|m9N4NVR6aa	I have heard, that a few different things will happen.<br>  <br>  1. Your ankles immediately shatter, as well as all your leg bones. They sort of compress together and smush like a pancake.

Not a pretty site.<br>  <br>  3. The bones in the neck break, due to the abrupt change in direction, considering you come to a complete stop after whoosing downward at over 90mph.<br>  <br>  Thats about it, plus all the other crzy things that happen within the body.

I think of it as meaning as little 'out of the packet' food as possible. So more veg, fruit, plain nuts etc. and also wholegrain stuff like brown rice and wholemeal bread!<br>  <br>  This is a healthy to me:<br>  Keep the banana but also have some carb e.g. porridge, bran, etc<br>  You should really try and pack about 350 cals into breakfast!<br>  <br>  Before lunch snack could be an apple, grapes etc<br>  <br>  Lunch could be wholemeal chicken sandwhich with cream cheese and salad or something<br>  <br>  etcetcetc<br>  <br>  ya know the kinda thing.

xIMdPQp2aa	I also have anxiety problems. They are caused by the brain either producing too much of certain chemicals, or not enough of others. The only way to improve your (my) condition is medication that regulates the production of those chemicals, or provides a synthetic form of them. <br>  Trust me I understand just how you feel, for several years not only did I not leave my house, but I could not be alone even at home. I tried everything I could think of, but I did not get better until I went back to my doctor, and started the meds. You will be glad you did. <br>  <br>  Here is my answer to W A, (this is the second time today I have said the same thing to this person);<br>  Now for W A, ignore this person. People that have never lived with mental illness have no idea what it is like. They believe that it is no big deal, or is "all in our head", not a real problem. What they don't know is mental illness is caused by either too much or too little of certain chemicals in the brain, thereby not allowing it to work correctly. This is not something that can be fixed by diet, or meditation or any of the other ridicules ideas I have heard. The only way to improve the condition is to either provide synthetic chemicals, or reduce the production of the other chemicals. This can only be done with medication.<br>  <br>  I wish that people that do not know what they are talking about would just keep their mouth's shut.|`|67NqWxuGaa	You might be interested in this free site to try the technique there...<br>  Yes, you can heal, absolutely... some people just change their diet to healthy  and that does it... research healthy diets like the michael thurmond site...<br>  here iis the site i mentioned www.emofree.com  there are healing articles there with your problems also<br>  take care|`|wwdllMzYaa	it is possible to deal witha  few of them on yoru own,<br>  but, its hard, and its not very commonly sucessful<br>  <br>  why cant you take the medication,have the therapy and see how that goes?<br>  why only 1?<br>  <br>  theres nothing at all wrong with needing help to over come some of our lifes problems<br>  we all do need help many times in our life<br>  <br>  it sound sliek you NEED the medication and the therapy, and i woudlnt advise stoppign either, not until you are able to do it on your own, which by the sounds of it, your not ready or able to do yet,|`|um6rmdegaa	anxiety can be a son of a gun and i think you need to get professional help or it could be with you forever.  hope you can do it without medication but it might be necessary at least for a short time or maybe just on certain occasions

r3JPM866aa	That shouldn't be a problem if you get enough protein and vitamins. When you lift weights, your body takes protein that may be used for growing taller and uses them to build muscle, but if you consume enough protien, you should be ok. Just be careful because too much protien can be very dangerous.<br>  <br>  Lifting weights will cause you to lose fat because you're burning calories that would otherwise be stored in the body as fat. If you burn more calories than you consume, you're body will turn the fat (a.k.a. stored calories) to get energy. You'll lose fat everywhere on your body, not just your arms. If you want to lose weight more than gain muscle, I suggest doing aerobics more than lifting. Aerobics, like riding a bike or running, will burn more calories than weight lifting.|`|zT2aGwzlaa	Lifting weights won't make you stop growing as long as you maintain a healthy, balanced diet and you don't become obsessed with exercise.<br>  <br>  To lose body fat, you have to burn more calories than you consume: it's that simple. Focus more on cardio than weightlifting to burn those calories.<br>  <br>  But honestly? You need to start paying attention in school, too. At 14 years of age, you shouldn't be making spelling mistakes like "exersisin" instead of "exercising" and "way" instead of "weigh". A good education will improve your life a lot more than will big muscles.<br>  <br>  AND LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER!|`|QoxLuTqqaa	Weight lifting isn't harmful at that age, as long as you take care. It won't stop your growth but will harm you if you don't do it properly. I've been weightlifting for a few years and have learned a lot about the body, and basically this is what I think:<br>  *Begin exercising once every other day. At this time, use dumbbells of about 5 kg. Advance weight as you grow.<br>  *Eat an energising and protein rich snack before you exercise, and after, to fuel your cells.<br>  *Weightlifting is definitely a good idea for pretty much anyone, it's a great way to combat depression (as it releases relaxant chemicals in the body), increase muscle size, decrease fat and stay generally healthy.<br>  *A generally good diet is just as important as exercise, so address your diet if you intend to exercise.<br>  *When and if you do exercise, exercise all of your muscle groups once a week - the groups I define are: upper arms, shoulders, back, legs, abs and chest. Maybe do one of these, every other day for about half an hour to an hour.<br>  *Weight lifting does help reduce fat, all over.<br>  <br>  I know some more about it, but too much to really write in here tbh. ;)|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	If you have not grown for three or more years, and are about the same height as your same-gender parent, then you're probably done growing and weight lifting will cause no harm.<br>  <br>  If there's any possibility of future growth, weight lifting can damage growth plates at the ends of bones, stopping that potential growth.|`|h3W9JnGBaa	100 percent completely false<br>  <br>  At your age i wouldnt recommend working out with heavy weights because it can cause stress on shoulders, elbows, neck, knees etc.<br>  <br>  I would just do cardo (running etc) along with pushups situps and other simple exercises<br>  <br>  Go to google and check "Resistance Training"<br>  <br>  Thats great for your age and wont cause stress on joints and tendents <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW ive grown 7 inches in 2 years since i started working out haha   <br>  <br>  not to forget lean muscle mass lol|`|VBmXurOfaa	listen to your mother not Y!A|`|c6rrtma8aa	Ok dude, i just know this: Arnold Schwarzenegger had been competing in bodybuilding before he turned 16. Joe Weider also, and i could name you a lot of other bodybuilders, who did this, and grown above 6'0 or higher, which is the average height. It has to do something with genetics, however it's unhealthy to lift heavy weights.You can do bodybuilding, but very carefully, especially when you lift above your head. Joe Weider also wrote about this in one of his books. He didn't say, that guys in your age can't do this, just very carefully. But if you want to lose weight, you should rather start with basic exercises. Good luck dude.|`|UFvOt2LPaa	Your 14 dude, you haven't even completely grown. Just wait and allow your body to develope. First your 14 your hormones are raging, developing and just at its highest producing rates! Your 5'2..it depends on your genetics. Most of all you can excercise go run,jog,swim, but if your trying to lift..consider taking protein shakes and lift light in high reps.<br>  <br>  You can not "spot reduce" thinking if you lift alot you can burn fat at a certain body part. You want to lose the fat from the stomach..then run or jog..30 mins minuim! Play sports because you first need to understand your still young and read up more on nutrition and weight lifting books.<br>  <br>  Check out www.bodybuilding.com for info. Lean muscle takes conditioning, dedication and years of training..and alot of Protein intake!|`|xaSTvSOGaa	i wouldnt know if thats true or not but its worth asking a doctor (no offense to mom) but seriously shorter people can lift more because they have less distance to lift the weight to make a complete rep and im 5 9 and 140 and out of shape... when im runnin in the summer im 120 and not scrawny just cut but think about how much longer you still have to grow i was probly your height when i was in 8th grade now im a senior in high school and 5 9 last i knew but lots of things supposedly stunt your growth and nothing "stops" your growth unless its an injury or some genetic defect|`|cMqrpQHyaa	wont hurt anything will help you look not so pudgy
2dBS6oknaa	15 pounds in two months with out a proper diet will be hard.  But if your willing to diet here are some hints:<br>  Cut out as much fats as possible...mayo, butter, oil (olive oil is good in moderation), emusified foods such as dressing.  Eliminate fatty foods...hamburgers, fries, sausage, anything greasy.  Eliminate sugar drinks...soda and juice.  STICK WITH WATER.  Salads, chicken breast, tuna, salmon, cottage cheese, fruits, nuts, dark chocolate, fat free milk, oats are your best choice of foods.<br>  <br>  As much as you might hate doing cardio, its probably the main thing to loosing weight quicker.  Change up your cardio work outs weekly.  Don't just do 15 minutes on the eliptical.  10 minutes on the treadmill, 10 on the eliptical, 10 one the bike will work for starters.  Alternate speeds also.  Increase times if you can...one week 30 min and the next 50 or 40.  Its totally up to you. <br>  <br>  Try different workouts if your body has plateaued.  Ask a trainer for some new exercises or go to a local book store and look in the muscle fitness area.   Constantly keeping your body shocked and in check is key to have muscles do their job. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps ...

I would put money on it that a doctor would say downright that he was!|`|kGmv4ikLaa	It won't change anything to do with puberty!<br>  <br>  Most everybody enjoys it, and it's healthy.<br>  <br>  I'd advise you to tell him not to worry.|`|ykruXR2Haa	It is better not to masturbate at all because of the bad consequences that may happen to you|`|9amb0Nk6aa	well im 12 and i do idk if i did hit it but i think i did and there's nuthin wrong wit me( i think)|`|yXXdPeKuaa	If it feels good, do it!

7w9AM9Tnaa	well i can't tell you that your mom was trying to kill herself or not.  but it could've been an accident that she took too much medicine. cause my grandma she was taking advil and she took too much like instead of 2, she took 3 because she didn't want the pain and she had to go to the hospital, but she wasn't trying to kill herself.  <br>  <br>  anyways i think you do have the right to see your mom especially since your almost an adult.<br>  <br>  i hope your mom gets better.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	You have every right to see your Mom. Is she in ICU or just in a room on the regular nursing floor?<br>  Is there a way for you to get to the hospital, neighbor or friend that can take you.<br>  Maybe your Mom is embarrassed, but once she sees your face I imagine she will be VERY happy to see you. If you can take a couple of magazines you know she likes to help her pass the time, but just you being there will be the best thing.  Good luck. P.S. see if you can talk with her doctor to find out what happened.<br>  Please if the situation gets to be too much (her depression and you trying to help her) talk with a school counselor. Your Mom could be put on disability and receive in home help to give you a break (IHSS) Then someone would be there while you are at school. <br>  Take care of yourself also.|`|AA12041870	I am very sorry you have to go through this.  I don't think your mom really wants to die.  I think the depression has such a handle on her that she doesn't know up from down, and the attempt was a call for help.  Go see her in the hospital.  Embarrassment is probably the last thing on her mind right now, and she needs people that she knows love her, like you obviously do.  Because your parents are divorced, your father is naturally not going to have feelings of love for her, and won't be tuned into what she really needs at this point. You can go see her at the hospital.  If anyone asks if you are 18, tell them yes.  That lousy year won't make a bit of difference.  Best of luck to you and her.  I hope she gets the help she needs.  Depression is horrible, and it is very difficult to fight off.|`|fbGv4iZ1aa	I think you should use the web and search articles on "why people attempt suicide" and "suicide warning signs" ect.  I think you will find far more answers there than from anyone here.  Good luck and sorry that you have to endure this at such a tender age. HUGS|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Just go see her.|`|akIpddDSaa	Honey, i care.<br>  I really do think your dad was just scared.<br>  i wouldnt know what to do in that situation. he was proabably worried for the whole family. depression doesnt always mean suicide, so please just calm down! Your dad, and i mean it, would for sure tell you if it was serious! from what your dad has said to you, he would basically tell you if it could lead to her suicide, and because your her daughter, you deserve to know.<br>  Dont worry honey, if things get worse, add another question, ill ad you as a contact, then asnwer your question about this problem. please, hope yuor mom is safe, i for one think shell be fine, the doctors are taking good care of your mom.|`|dv0bLUFZaa	timmy ur a loser<br>  <br>  Its okay ur dad is there and all the doctors can see her.<br>  <br>  If ur mom doesnt come home for another week then i suggest u go visit her anytime ur not busy.<br>  weekend,skip school(shes ur mom , who needs help so its okay to skip in this case)<br>  <br>  Always pray for her and have faith.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	It sounds serious to me. I think your mom must be in a bad way or they'd let you visit. That don't mean that she didn't accidentally take to much cold medicine or that it didn't react well with her regular meds. It could have been an accident.|`|67NqWxuGaa	cant say, wasnt there, it could have been, tho....<br>  YOu know, even if they wont let you in, which I dont understand , maybe you could check their policy.....  <br>  If you are interested you could go to this free site and learn the technique and apply to YOUR feelings...<br>  HUGS.....|`|c011b76bad6ad0a0eb8d7acd8454debbaa	somebodys lieing to you|`|8zV90Lpoaa	Go visit. You need to be with her no matter how hard it is and no matter what your father says.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	set hidden cameras in ur house!|`|6C24kJhaaa	That is hard. The important thing is to  face and accept your own destination. ask yourself, do you wanna see yourself in 30 years like your mom is now? No, so do not get distracted by your mom's condition and slack off, or more likely avoid school because you feel troubled. I do this for alot of questions, and i know u might be thinking "thats not really what im asking" but my good friend became a highschool dropout because of his parents' divorce, his grandma's death, his house being repossesd. <br>  <br>  On another note, you cant jump to the worse. I know that probbly took you off guard but your dad might be telling the truth. Another reason he may not want you to see ur mom is becuz she is really pissed and mad and just wants to die. I saw my uncle like that and it changed al the happy memories i ever had of him. <br>  <br>  He was swearing and asking every1 to kill him etc etc. so just wait it out, and stay strong trooper.|`|xieiM0FRaa	I wouldn't assume anything for the time being, but I'm leaning towards suicide attempt, just because your dad is acting really fishy. Just go see her...talk to her doctor...talk to her...skip a day of school if you have to. I mean, your mom's in the hospital! If you're dad wasn't acting like he was, then I would say that there's a good chance it wasn't attempted suicide, but you're dad's acting strange, so I can see why you're so worried.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope your mom feels better!|`|iHeUypFeaa	k first of all you should NOT be telling the world this this is between you and your mom and you dad i no belive my it is scary its happend to me before|`|xRJijvjCaa	NO , i dont thinks so just listen to your dad if there was something serious that happened he would have told you ,hope everything is ok|`|GQRs83Haaa	It's sounds like she could've tried. I'm sorry you have to go through this. If you ever want to talk you can email me.|`|Wg6h4jYRaa	Go march into that hospital and say you NEED to see your mother|`|mJ1tB1K0aa	You will find the answer in yourself,<br>  <br>  do you think your mom would try to do it?|`|7at1Hyn8aa	I think your intuition may be right on the money.  Maybe your dad is worried that you might slip into a depression too, if you see your mom, or that maybe you would blame yourself for what happened to her when you were not home.  <br>  Try to talk to him again.  Tell him that you are 17 and not a little child anymore (nicely, not in an angry tone).  Tell him you would feel better if you saw your mom, just because you would know then that she is in good hands and being taken care of.<br>  You could bluff your way through a little by telling him you called the hospital and they said there is no such rule of a daughter not getting in under 18.  <br>  As a matter of fact, you could actually call the hospital and ask to get transferred to the nursing station in your moms wing.  Ask the nurse how your mom is doing and to find out if your mom would be okay with seeing you.<br>  <br>  Do take care of yourself, and since you know the signs and symptoms of depression, if you feel yourself getting depressed seek help immediately.|`|jmP2mP3eaa	im very sorry about that, but think of it this way: If your mother is on anti-depresants, dont you think she would rather try to overdose on those, and not cold pills?? If she truley wanted to die, she would have used something much stronger. <br>  <br>  P.S: i dont know if ur dad is lieing, but if he is, dont blame him.  he must be under alot of stress, and he wants to protect you from the bad things in this world. from the way it looks, he hasnt excepted you as an adult yet. you should prove it to him somehow, as in handeling this situation very well. hope i helped!!<br>  once again: soo sorry!!|`|qKMph7KEaa	Most of the time, patients on restricted wards aren't allowed to have visitors under 18; ie. she's most likely on a mental health ward, or under lock-down.<br>  <br>  The fact that she OD'd on cold pills is a good indication that she did try to commit suicide, and your father's excuses only further that assumption.  At this point, the best you can do is wait and see what happens to her, if she gets better, and if they're willing to let her keep you.  The fact that she's proven herself mentally unsound is grounds for a change in custody, so it's doubtful that she'll retain custodial rights.<br>  <br>  Seeing as you're almost 18, it may be a blessing; you won't be caught up in the middle of this mess, as long as you head off to college or move out.  The last thing you should do is try to take responsibility for your mother, and don't start thinking that her condition is your fault or dependent on you: It's a trap.|`|rhsP7LoQaa	Sounds like your mother has had it rough. Anti-Depressants? Those work but i mean really taking pills to make you happy doesn't really make you happy at all. You need to support your mom in whats right, obviously drinking was an escape for her but honestly what that does to you is make your breath smelly and life miserable. Your mom probably -from the sound of it- tried to commit suicide yet i dont even know her. What your mom needs isnt pills, she needs support from her loved ones.  Your mother needs to know that if she was to ever leave this world she would be missed greatly and that YOU would be torn apart. Because really no matter how inactive your mom is and sulky, you love her and wouldnt bear it if she were gone. So i say go see your mom first thing tomorrow. Ask for a ride, pay for a cab, what ever. She needs you. And youre dad was probably trying to prevent you from knowing but its a little too obvious you know the truth right. GO be with your mom, and tell her you love her, and need her in this world with you. She needs love and support not pills.|`|yAEyqGmCaa	Well it depends on what ward she is in.  If there is some sort of quarantine or whatever then I do suppose it is possible.  But I have done a lot of visiting to the hospital in my day and family members usually always have free reign to visit.  Perhaps your mom tried to kill herself and if it was an attempted suicide then I am very sorry.  These are tough situations and grueling to get through.  Maybe she has been drinking again? And accidently took this amount of medicine. Consider your circumstances though- does your dad really have a reason to not want you to see your mom? Maybe you should take it for face value, maybe your mom is just truly ashamed with herself and doesn't want you to see her like that.  What parent would? She's your mom, she wants you to look up to her.  In ending you are 17 - If you disagree with what your dad said and still really want to go see your mom go drive to the hospital and ask.  If you are concerned that maybe she doesn't want you to see her check your phonebook for the hospital number, call them and see if she is in a room and you can be directed to it.  You can at least talk to her on the phone.

AA10975447	Yes, swollen testes are a bad thing. That can be a complication of gonorrhea and chlamydia. These infections cause inflammation if your urethra, and if left untreated, it spreads down into your epididymis and then into your testes. Not only does this result in painful swelling, but it can also render you sterile. Fortunately, gonorrhea and chlamydia are both preventable by abstinence or proper condom use during sex.<br>  <br>  btw, the same painful swelling and inflammation can be a consequence of mumps, too. Make sure you've gotten your booster shots!
fk9AvB25aa	Out breaks can take 7-14 days to heal. The second could take as long as the first to heal or it could be a few days shorter then your last out break. Out breaks get less sever over time, that doesn't mean that the second out break will be any better or worse then the first. My second out break of cold sores was just about as bad as the first. But there is nothing to predict how out breaks will be for you, you just have to wait and see.<br>  You can try medications or suppressive therapy, they can help to prevent out breaks. You can also use creams right when you first feel the symptoms to help prevent a sore from breaking out.|`|TWrRAMRAaa	I feel your pain. I was just like you last summer, when i got my first outbreak- it was like world war 2 on my face! It took about 14 days for mine to go away, and then 2 weeks later they would reappear. I was so depressed. However as of today I havnt had an outbreak in about 4 months. What I do to control my outbreaks is take 1000mg of L-lysine everyday, drink lots of water, stay away from chocolate, salt, and things with splenda (fake sugar) in them as much as I can. I try to wear lip balm, Blistex is best, when going out into the wind or sun. <br>  Now when I do have an outbreak, I put hydrogen peroxide on the sore, before it has popped. Doing this may even stop it from popping altogether, than I put Zovirax cream on it, let it dry, and repeat that procedure every hour. Sometimes I can stop the cold sore from popping, other times I'm not so lucky. But you can get Zovirax cream from your doctor, it's a perscription.<br>  Hope this helps!

mE04AuPNaa	It usually takes about a year for periods to become regular. Give her time and then take her to the GYN or NHS doc to be sure everything is ok. It usually does sort itself out. I doubt there is anything to be concerned about. Unless her energy levels drop that might indicate she is becoming slightly anaemic due to the amount she has been bleeding. And for now don't let her  wear tampons so that you can monitor her periods, or until everything sorts itself out and/or  you have had her checked out and the Docs says there's nothing to worry about, its just her young body sorting itself out.|`|lxg26r8Laa	Her doctor would know best, but I've always been a light and frequent menser myself.

hsEo77F9aa	Woah.<br>  <br>  An HIV negative test 3 months after an exposure is right in over 99.5% of cases. In the other fraction of a percent of cases it can take up to 6 months for the test to pick up the infection. In these very rare cases there is a serious and pre-existing immune dysfunction --- like someone whose immune system has been destroyed by radiation/cancer chemotherapy, or a person who is taking high dose corticosteroids after receiving an organ transplant to prevent organ rejection. There are a few other rare disorders which can do this, but virtually all are diagnosed before adolesence. These are very rare.<br>  <br>  So, no, you don't need to be worried about that particular exposure. Anytime you have unprotected sex with someone (who is not a completely monogomous partner) you are putting yourself at risk for a variety of STIs. Most of these, including HIV, can have no symptoms. <br>  You shouldn't let HIV scare or worry you ---- all you have to do is remember that as the number of partners increases, the likelihood of exposing yourself increases, and do the following:<br>  -learn the in's and out's of condom use....not just 'how to put one on', but the whole things from beginning to end, how to make it feel better, etc., . (start by reading this <a href="http://aidsguelph.org/condom-tips1" rel="nofollow">http://aidsguelph.org/condom-tips1</a> )<br>  <br>  -use condoms with all your sexual partners....just make it something you do.... <br>  <br>  -get a full STI screening done annually at the minimum, more frequently as needed depending on risk factors. just make it something you do. It is better to do something out of a routine than to associate the event (getting tested) with anxiety and fear which happens when you only get tested in reaction to a specific event.<br>  <br>  And again, an HIV test 3 months after an exposure will let you know if you are HIV+ or not, unless you fit one of those rare exceptions. In fact, 75% of people will test positive 17-20 days after being infected, by two months the number jumps to 95% and by 3 months, 99.5%. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	test again next year to be sure|`|396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	Everyone who is sexually active should be concerned about HIV.  If you think you were exposed you should be tested again at six months, and then at twelve months.  I think they say that 95% of people who have been infected will test positive within six months of exposure, the rest will test positive within twelve.|`|quzXdf8gaa	If the test came back negative, then there is no having to worry.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	A "strain" should never spread unless you have had further trauma.  "Strains" don't happen without a specific traumatic incident or overuse.  <br>  <br>  Rather, pain in the upper back is usually referred from a cervical disc.  This type of pain can spread with continued poor posture and prolonged static postures such as repetitive upper extremity work (ie, assembly line).  (of course, this is provided all medical causes of upper back pain have been ruled out such as ulcers). <br>  <br>  If your physical therapist was not certified in mechanical diagnosis and therapy, I'd really recommend it...it's much different than the "typical" stretches and "stabilization" exercises one would typically get for this type of problem.  If it is referred pain from a disc, massage will not help it either.  <br>  <br>  You can find a PT who is certified in mechanical diagnosis and therapy at: www.mckenziemdt.org  Treatment is usually short and brief...most people are significantly better in two weeks, if it is a reducible problem.|`|Ybu2E2OWaa	you don't use heat on acute injuries for one and you should ask your Doctor about orthopedics

It is usually followed with hemorrhoids as well.<br>  <br>  If you do go to the doctor they will most likely prescribe a mild muscle relaxer and a stool softener.<br>  <br>  You need to take warm "sitz" or baths about 2-3 times a day to help heal it, but other then that there shouldn't be anything wrong.<br>  <br>  If the problem does persist after 2 weeks or so then see your doctor and have him inform you about ulcers, I have three of them, they bleed, and in my opinion (since I'm allergic to everything) prevacid is the best acid reducer for it.<br>  <br>  Until then eat easy to digest foods, sitz in the bathtub, and some ibuprofen for inflammation. <br>  <br>  Get better soon!|`|XF2vVY3Uaa	You probably have hemorrhoids that can cause bright red blood to come out of your anus while going to the bathroom.

13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	Of course.  Studies have proved that there are several ties to dementia and alcohol.  When you binge drink you are flooding your system with way too much at one time.  You can also damage your liver or an organ like your gale bladder.  I have known several binge drinkers.  And yes they did experience being off!  It was chronic.  I have known alcoholics  who drink less than you and had these side affects.  You are drinking high concentrations and not even letting your body recover and then doing it again.  Your body chemistry gets off kilter and that's what makes the body susceptible to diseases and brain damage.  You should be reading from Mayo Health or American Health Assoc. or even AA or NA literature can give you some ideas.  You get that horrible pain in your head because its your body's way of telling you to stop.

And then i like to stretch at the beginning of the day.. haha<br>  <br>  MORE TIPS: <br>  <br>  chew gum - sugar free.

The most unexpensive weight loss thing to do, is to try to burn more calories than you eat, dont eat unhealthy like a 500 calorie diet! All that will do is make you sick, you NEED to be healthy to lose weight properly. Im trying to lose weight too! So basically here are some tips to speed up your metabolism: Drink 1-3 glasses of green tea a day<br>  Try and eat Chilli peppers somehow, ((chilli DUH )) they help. <br>  8 classes of water a day<br>  <br>  the more active you are, the faster your metabolism will grow to be. <br>  <br>  did you know that breathing for an hour burns 60 calories all on its own? And SLEEP is very important, try to go to sleep on time and get your ages average amount of sleep,. ask your doctor what a healthy weight for you is, and then after you have reached that goal do sit ups and crutches - among many other core excersises, Run to slim out, and make sure you burn more calories than you eat - had to repeat that!<br>  <br>  Fruits and veggies are REALLY low in calories and FULL of nutrition. If you like Tacos? Ditch the hard shell, maybe try a taco salad.. without the shell of course! Lettuce with meat is good, but PLEASE try mixing it with turkey and beef so that it isnt all fat. Chicken salad is good, you want the protein but you dont want fried anything really, once in a while if fine but remember - YOU HAVE TO BURN OFF THOSE EXTRA CALORIES. Excersises excersise excersise. Dont over do it - dont starve yourself, be moderate and stay active. GOOGLE: 100 ways to burn 100 calories, their are some pretty cool things you can do! <br>  <br>  Stay away from starchy and high carb foods - mostly white things. Bread is a bad, so try to stick to thin, HIGH in fiber, slices :) <br>  <br>  you can google all the stuff and before you know it you will feel so good about it all and IM actually excited to start working out and all that, just because I know what it will do for me!<br>  <br>  I hope i helped :D

u05Qiodyaa	The birth control pill ruined my hair...mine used to be so pretty and curly, and now it is dry, tempermental, and barely wavy. I was on the pill for 8 years. On top of it, about 2 months after I quit I began LOSING my hair! Every time I ran my fingers through it I would lose about 30-40 strands. The texture changed completely, and my hair became so thinned out - people asked all the time if I got a hair cut but it was just because I was losing so much hair! I was so upset, but fortunately after about 4 months it pretty much stopped falling out one day, and it has almost gone back to normal. I will never go on the pill again. Good luck to you!|`|EMbaak9waa	Yeah i would get off this pill and go and try another pill.<br>  Its obviously not agreeing with your body type.

Some companies will write a policy for folks up to 70, some up to 80, some up to 90.

Figure upwards of $70,000 per million.<br>  <br>  Due to increased risk, a lot of companies won't insure seniors at all. There are plenty of companies and you'll find one that will take the risk, but the premium will be very high relative to the benefit. It may not be a good investment for you.<br>  <br>  It might just make sense to make sure you have enough to pay final or burial expenses.  <br>  <br>  AARP (through NY Life), United Insurance Co of America, Transamerica, and AFLAC are a few that write policies for seniors.<br>  <br>  There are companies, also, who will provide financing for senior life insurance policies.

rCWq3yILaa	Sheila, first off, don't panic! It's not the end of the world. <br>  <br>  Depending on how they go about it, you might have just separators put between your molars. Or if you've already had those, they might put metal bands around the same molars. Usually that's the starting point. <br>  <br>  Now, for the uncomfortable truth. Your teeth will start to move, and you will be sore. It will hurt when you eat. And you'll want to rip those things out of your mouth yourself. <br>  <br>  HANG IN THERE! It only lasts for a few days/weeks, depending on how much your teeth move or need to move. Take some pain killers (Ibuprofen or whatever your Orthodontist prescribes), and have patience. The other thing is that the metal in your mouth is going to rub against your cheeks, and will irritate and make them sore or painful.  Get some wax from your Ortho, and put it on where it hurts. You'll go through a lot of wax at first, but eventually that, too will get better. <br>  <br>  There is also a product called Rincinol (I think that's the correct spelling) that will help with the canker sores caused by the metal pieces rubbing your cheeks. <br>  <br>  Trust me when I tell you, it's worth the pain you go through. My teeth are now straight and beautiful! And I only had to put up with some pain for a few months. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|LvZB13obaa	it doesn't hurt when you have them put on, the only bit that's not nice is when they tighten them up. but even then, it wears off in a day.<br>  <br>  don't worry, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  cosmic angel|`|l1uk1wBAaa	It's hell on earth.

RbULKPWOaa	Most people think of fungal yeast infections or Candida albicans (also known as Thrush and Balanitis) as a female issue, however, men frequently develop the condition. <br>  <br>  Candida in men occurs in the groin area; it can cause soreness, itching, and redness of the head of the penis, scrotum, and foreskin. Often times, small white spots on the penis, burning sensations during intercourse, and transient rashes may identify the ailment. Due to the fact that Candida thrives in warm, sweaty, and irritated skin, uncircumcised men are actually more likely to develop Candida. <br>  <br>  In addition, not only does, the fungal yeast thrive on the high sugar content found in men with diabetes, it can also result as an allergic reaction to perfumes, dyes, soaps, and shower gels.<br>  <br>  See your doctor ASAP|`|ObJTgBafaa	Someone raped you in your sleep - you have HERPES!!!!!!!!

Ql9ZCVapaa	Pull ups will target your entire back muscles, especially your lats, as well as your arms, specifically the biceps. Doing pull ups (palms facing away from you) will target the lats more while chin ups (palms facing toward you) will put more emphasis on the biceps. Both variations are excellent for training the back.<br>  <br>  With pull ups, you'll want to have at least a shoulder-width grip on the bar. The wider your grip, the harder the exercise. With chin ups, you don't need such a wide grip, just 6 to 8 inches is enough.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you train your forearms too, because if you don't have a strong grip you won't be able to do as many pull ups as you would like. Try using a hand gripping device to strengthen your grip or you can just squeeze a rubber ball to get the same effect. Do this throughout the day as much as possible.<br>  <br>  You can train your biceps to become stronger as well by doing curls for your arms, but I think that chin ups are a more convenient way of strengthening them, especially if you don't have any free weights to work out with.<br>  <br>  Pull ups/chin ups are an excellent way to build upper body strength. It gives you that impressive v-shape to your back and gives the impression that you are broad-shouldered. You target many muscles at once and over time you become very strong. To gain entry in the Navy Seals, you need to do at least 6 pull ups, and most men can't even do one. If you can do 8 to 10 reps for three sets, then you are doing very well.|`|AA11564934	bicep and lats|`|t8kykME3aa	Read here: <a href="http://pull-ups-training.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pull-ups-training.com/</a>|`|fBGDqqGXaa	Triceps,biceps,deltoids,shoulder muscles.<br>  Theirs different ways of doing pull ups<br>  With you arms wide open,close together,on both side of the bar...try everything

If there was a Detox that actually worked, the people that made it would be rich and everyone would know about it.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  Side Lunge Slide<br>  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.<br>  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot to the side, torso<br>  upright and abs in.

It may just be that it hasn't happened for you yet, and everything is normal, however, by getting checked out you can determine if there is a problem with yourself or your husband, and approach a way to solve this problem. There have been so many advances in sub-fertility treatment, that its nothing to be scared of. <br>  Make sure your GP knows about your previous termination, as this can affect future fertility, and its best the doctors have the full picture in order to investigate you correctly. <br>  Despite this, your Dr may suggest you loose some weight, and get to a healthy BMI, which may solve your problem. <br>  even if the problem isn't to do with weight i thin you should look seriously about loosing some, just so that you stand a better chance of a normal, healthy, successful pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ouHd1vu9aa	I would try drinking raspberry leaf tea (3 or more cups a day) and take some natural vitamin c tabs (you can break the tablet up and take 3-4 small doses during the day, thats what i do) pleanty of raw fruit and veg in your diet.

Sometimes and orgasm can help, so it sounds weird, but you can try "taking care of yourself."<br>  <br>  You say you know you are not pregnant, and in the next sentence ask how soon you can test...so that sounds like you DO think it's a possibility.  Most drug store pregnancy tests say you can test 5 days after you were supposed to get your period.  The chance of a false negative is quite high if you test too soon, so if you do one at 5 days that's negative and you still don't get your period, wait a few days and take another one.<br>  <br>  Stress can make your period late, or make you skip one all together.  Be sure to do the pregnancy tests, and if they are OK, chalk it up to stress and see what happens in a month.  <br>  <br>  In my experience, sometimes just the stress from being afraid of being pregnant would seem to make me late!  I would go buy a test, take it, it would be negative, and I'd usually get it later that day or the next day.  So I guess doing a pregnancy test could be another way to jump start it!  : )

I've been going a dietitian for years because I'm a picky eater so I know a lot about balanced eating. That's what you should do, go to a dietitian. Balanced eating is really the key to slim bodies, if you're missing a nutrient your body is just going to stock fat away in your body because it thinks there might be a famine ahead. I'm serious, get to a dietitian or if you're already doing that and it doesn't work try optimum dieting, not only with the person help with tips on food but she'll take notes on your psychological feelings around it.<br>  As for fitness, I use my mum's old aerobics videos, cut the sound, put on some wild music and go twice as fast as they are (they're way too slow in those old tapes XD)... just keep going until you can do nothing else but collapse on the floor (no stopping at ''I'm tired''... stop at ''I'm exhausted and dripping wet'')... though I'm no expert on work outs so do it at your own rhythm.

IT's a really helpful tool for tracking what you eat and your exercise. You want to limit your calorie intake and increase your exercise. Go out and buy this month's issue of SELF magazine (it has Taylor Swift on the cover) and it has a lot of details about the self challenge.<br>  <br>  In order to lose 2 pounds a week, it says you need to burn 500 calories a day. I forget how many calories it suggests you eat a day, but I think it's something around 1600.<br>  <br>  You need to keep track of what you eat, and you can't lie to yourself! Everything has calories and if you have one bite of this, and another of that it all adds up. I'm not trying to be harsh, but it's just how it works. And definitely drink those 8 glasses of water a day. it helps to initially flush you out (so you might lose an unexpected amount of weight the first week, and then 1 or 2 the following week). Plus water has no calories. Why waste calories on other drinks when you can actually eat something with them?<br>  <br>  As far as exercise goes, try and start with walking for 20 minutes a day, or riding your bike. If you dread exercise (which most of us do) it will last forever. I usually walk on my treadmill for 30 minutes and do 30 minutes on my gazelle. but i watch TV while I do it so it's not so boring.<br>  <br>  It's going to take a while to lose the weight but just remember that it's possible!!

FLAtdWrmaa	You get yourself to a doctor NOW!<br>  <br>  A week and a half is not nearly long enough to get off this medication.  For some people, the withdrawal can be months!  This is a powerful drug, as you're finding out, and you need to give your body a reasonable amount of time to adjust to every change of dosage.  (You didn't go up to that dosage all at once, did you?  You're supposed to taper the dose upwards at the beginning, and take even longer to taper downwards at the end.)<br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable going to the doctor who originally prescribed for you, find another doctor to help you out.  How old are you?  Do you manage your own medical care, or are you a dependent (on your mother, maybe)?  Just don't wait any more.<br>  <br>  Explain to the new doctor what your history is with Citalopram, including the inability to get refills at the moment. Describe your particular symptoms to the doctor.  The doctor may want to squeeze you in for an appointment sooner than normally, rather than make you suffer longer without a refill.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of these shocky episodes, but dizziness and twitching are both side effects (maybe a combination is producing the shock effect?).  Loss of focus, sleepiness, bizarre dreams (not nightmares, usually, just bizarre), and feeling jumped-up (like too much caffeine) can all be side effects, too.  Read the insert that comes with each refill, it will have a list of possible side effects in the fine print.  The list is pretty scary, btw -- but nobody gets all of them, it's just a wide-ranging drug.<br>  <br>  This can be a very nasty time for you, but at least it won't kill you.  I wish you the best of luck getting relief!|`|HsX4H0FLaa	The zaps are standard SSRI withdrawal, they are more usually the brain zaps, but also experienced are the body zaps. Your description of them is spot on. Crying spells and emotional lability are very common withdrawal symptoms, as are nausea and sleep disturbances.  It's really something that should be tapered off over a few months, cold turkey isn't recommended. You can get liquid citalopram which allows for an acccurate and steady taper. Some people get over the process swiftly, others do not.
mSjglSI6aa	If pregnancy may be a concern, then definitely get a pregnancy test and don't do any drugs.  <br>  <br>  There are many reason you may pass out, including blood pressure problems.  You might have that checked too, since you had just climbed up a hill.  Sometimes, just simply standing up with blood pressure problems can create dizziness and pass out.  <br>  <br>  I used to pass out regularly, with no other symptoms.  A chiropractor finally found what doctors had been missing - a birth defect in my spine.  Realignment of the spine stopped the passing out episodes which I had been having for over 10 years!!

HmzMLkymaa	You sound like such a lovely young lady :)<br>  <br>  Honey-  Your not going to be alone and what your experiencing is normal for many. It's great to join organizations and widen your social network, but you also have to participate.  I don't believe you mentioned taking an active interest with your fellow colleagues.  It's unfortunate that people don't approach others unless they feel the person is approachable.  Maybe your timidness is giving them mixed signals.  Trust me, you can make friends and as sure as there will be night....you will make them.  Take the initiative--I know your shy, but get more involved.  Start small conversation and when people are exchanging #'s don't be bashful.....go in and give them your # and take theres.  It takes practice and at first you may seem a little apprehensive, but you'll get over this.  Also--go to www.meetup.com.  It's a great way to meet others and just get yourself comfortable approaching people w/o the pressure.  You go to a meeting and meet people who aren't in your social circle.  This way if you don't like the setting or the people you don't have to see them again. <br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  Take care and god bless|`|V2rsAhOfaa	I assume you are in your 20's.

I have experienced the same thing.  Please don't take it the wrong way, it is not meant to be an insult at all, but just to explain something that might be happening that you are not aware of.  Sometimes, sadly without doing it on purpose or even being aware of it we send out signals of being desperate and these are very subtle.  Just thinking about not fitting in, can send out an image in the way you act that you have a low self-esteem.  Always think;  people are attracted to independant and self-confident and secure people.  If you can figure out what might be causing this little negative or weak vibe about yourself, you can change it.  But just so you know, as I was reading through your question, I could see absolutely nothing bad about your person, you seem like a nice and outgoing person.  You just maybe feel a bit rejected and are self conscious.  First big step to building a stronger image of self esteem, is to act independant, let people come to you and run less after them, just do your thing and don't worry about other people, they will come on their own if you give them time and space.<br>  <br>  hope this helps : )

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Doctors recommend that you not lose more than 10 pounds in a month, depending on how much you have to lose.  You need to lessen your calories 3500 to lose a pound either through eating less or exercising more.  I would recommend you follow the type of eating recommended in the following and keep up the exercise.<br>  <br>  If you want to eat healthy, try low fat, high protein, low carb diet.  Eat meat like chicken, fish and turkey, never fried, either grilled or baked.  Eat low fat cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, etc., to help cut the fat out of your diet.  When it comes to carbohydrates, avoid potatoes, rice, pasta and anything made with white flour, like cake, bread, cookies, pies, candy or anything with suger.  Don't drink soda with sugar, try tea, coffee, diet soda instead.  Do eat salad, green leafy veggies like lettuce, spinace, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, etc., because these are low glycemic veggies.  Also try to get fiber in your diet through bran cereal, fruit with the peel, whole wheat bread, etc.<br>  <br>  This type of diet is filling and healthy and will produce benefits in the long run.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|dpgXzMenaa	No more than one pound every 4 days... so about 8 pounds per month.<br>  <br>  Exercise a lot more and eat a little less.  that's all you have to do if you're eating healthy food.

1621a26ae8d36f82059bebca15cbb2fbaa	Hello hun as far as conceiving you should have no problem getting pregnant, well not as much as you did before you had your IUD in place. Fertility returns as soon as you remove your IUD. If there was no complications while the IUD was in place, and no tissue has grown around it, the IUD removal is super easy. I think there is more discomfort when it is being placed, than when it is being removed. Good Luck.|`|IxLkAEA3aa	I had the iud for three years also after i had my one and only child. i had it removed in november to try and concieve again my husband and i have been trying since then even tho my doc told us to way 3 periods to thicken the lining of my cervix back up but still no luck :( it doesnt hurt or anything when its taken out and your period will likely start back up that same month, mine did and ive had one every month since then ... but as for concieving ive heard many people say it can take up to a year after iud and others that have gotten prego right away... me im still trying... good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  nd
71u8FVwyaa	It depends on the person. I took Yaz for one month. Everything was fine till I started the placebos at the end. One day I was angry all day for no reason. I knew I shouldn't be angry, but I was. The very next day I just cried constantly. I had no reason why I was crying, but I couldn't stop. By day three of the placebos my neck swelled out to my ears. I had to rush to the ER. <br>  <br>  These are not normal side effects.

yKQKzKwMaa	Any dramatic cut or fluctuation in hormones will most likely effect your mood. As a natural remedy, I would suggest vigorous exercise [without much heavy lifting!] and cardio to both release endorphins and any harboring aggression. Also, indulge in relaxation therapy; something as simple as spraying lavender essential oil near your pillowcase can do wonders! Personally, I suffer from panic attacks, which I find are not very different from rage. To quell them, I take the deepest breath I can, hold it for as long as I can, then slowly release it. Focusing on my breathing really takes my mind off of my fears. I hope I was of some help!|`|LN2nIbeCaa	A change in hormones can definitely cause a change in mood.<br>  <br>  You may want to speak to your physician about trying an anti depressant to deal with this, since you can't take hormone replacement.<br>  <br>  Holy Basil is an herbal remedy for mood also, you should be able to find it at a store that specializes in supplements if you don't want to take prescription medication.

If you don't start on-time, take a pregnancy test like 1st response as it can detect the pregnancy hormones before the first day of your missed period. If you took the pills as directed as soon as possible after birth control failure (within 72 hours), you should be ok.

You also have to make sure you dont lie down for at least half an hour after you take the tablet.

Hzf3QK9faa	A vitamin is an organic compound required as a nutrient in tiny amounts by an organism.[1] A compound is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism, and must be obtained from the diet. Thus, the term is conditional both on the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid functions as vitamin C for some animals but not others, and vitamins D and K are required in the human diet only in certain circumstances.[2]<br>  <br>  Vitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity, not their structure. Thus, each "vitamin" may refer to several vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin. Such a set of chemicals are grouped under an alphabetized vitamin "generic descriptor" title, such as "vitamin A," which includes the compounds retinal, retinol, and many carotenoids.[3] Vitamers are often inter-converted in the body. The term vitamin does not include other essential nutrients such as dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, or essential amino acids, nor does it encompass the large number of other nutrients that promote health but are otherwise required less often.[4]<br>  <br>  Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions, including function as hormones (e.g. vitamin D), antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E), and mediators of cell signaling and regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (e.g. vitamin A).[5] The largest number of vitamins (e.g. B complex vitamins) function as precursors for enzyme cofactor bio-molecules (coenzymes), that help act as catalysts and substrates in metabolism. When acting as part of a catalyst, vitamins are bound to enzymes and are called prosthetic groups. For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. Vitamins also act as coenzymes to carry chemical groups between enzymes. For example, folic acid carries various forms of carbon group – methyl, formyl and methylene - in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.[6]<br>  <br>  Until the 1900s, vitamins were obtained solely through food intake, and changes in diet (which, for example, could occur during a particular growing season) can alter the types and amounts of vitamins ingested. Vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive pills for several decades,[7] allowing supplementation of the dietary intake.

BhlGe0A8aa	i think most people gain weight on any birth control method that affects your hormones.|`|eAupvb3taa	I did not gain weight on Depo. Loved it. But just had to switch back to the pill because my bone density test was not the greatest. Depo can cause bone loss. Each person is different. I loved Depo (was on it for 8 years) and will miss the no periods, no cramps, no PMS. Your friend is wrong...you can go off Depo anytime you want. I was scheduled to get my shot on Sunday and started my pills instead per my doctors instruction. No big deal. Everybody reacts differently to Depo some love it (like me) some hate it. I would suggest trying it and if it has adverse affects, you switch to something else. It's that easy :-)|`|LN2nIbeCaa	It is possible to gain a small amount of weight being on Depo, but not any more likely than taking the pill.  The average weight gain from being on a hormonal contraceptive (the pill or Depo) is 5 pounds. <br>  It is not true that if you gain weight being on it that you won't be able to take it off.  If you exercise and eat right, it shouldn't be a concern.<br>  <br>  I was on Depo for a year and a half, and did not gain any weight from it.<br>  <br>  On a side note, Depo has been shown to increase the risk of osteoporosis by causing bone loss, so while you are on it, it is important to take a daily calcium supplement with Vitamin D.|`|AA12198724	My sister gained a lot of weight when she was on the Depo shot. When she got off of it she did lose a lot of it (like 50-70 pounds but she was taking another medication as well). My aunt had the shot after she had my cousin and right now she is battling some weight gain too. My cousin got the shot as well and she did gain a few pounds. Also my sister told me what sucks is that during the time of the months when you are supposed to get your period you end up with an awful smelling discharge.

a0vhjTIzaa	Slimquick and hoodia are diet pills & supplements. Diet pill manufacturing companies are working towards upgrading the effect of supplements that work on the brain to speed-up body metabolism, suppress appetite or curb cravings. These pills are becoming more powerful and without any concrete scientific evidence to support such weight loss claims. One of the main components in most popular diet supplements is "ma huang" or ephedra sinica (a type of cone-bearing shrub). The chemical has been linked to heart attacks, strokes, seizures and death to user. The FDA in 1997 issued warnings to manufacturers for misleading labeling as well as informing the public about these labels. They are also proposing a regulation to the US government that all dietary supplements containing ephedra should display a health warning on the product label.<br>  <br>  The side effects of taking OTC drugs are contributed from the way that varieties of chemical compound are bind together to form the final products. Due to the fact that dosage instructions are inadequate in most of the drugs, it makes these supplements even more dangerous to the general public. Possible side effects include rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, dizziness, nervousness, kidney damage and heart failure. Diet pills that work on the brain to suppress appetite have slightly different side effects which include hair loss, chest pain, fever, depression and heart damage.<br>  <br>  Hoodia is a genus of 13 species in the flowering plant family Apocynaceae, under the subfamily Asclepiadoideae. They are stem succulents, described as "cactiform" because of their remarkable similarity to the unrelated cactus family.<br>  <br>  Hoodia diet pills have not been approved by the FDA. This means that there is no comprehensive research being done about the ideal dosage that is not detrimental to the health in the long term. Even pills that are available by prescription can be powerful enough to leave users with significant side effects and even dependency.<br>  <br>  Scientists say that hoodia can be up to 100,000 times more effective than glucose in controlling the hunger signal in the brain. As such, greater care should be taken when consuming this potent herbal extraction. Ephedrine which is also an herbal extraction was banned in 2004 due to several deaths linked to it. <br>  <br>  Our own metabolism system play a vital part in controlling the amount of body fat burned in the process of providing energy to the body. Knowledge about our own metabolism function is the mother to all weight loss program. With the knowledge you not only reduce your weight but able to maintain an ideal weight and living a healthy life. Best of all you can eat what you most enjoyed without gaining any weight. The source will show you the way and it could probably safe your life as well.

lC1IYDJEaa	Eating 1000 cals a day is the least effective way to lose your weight. women need to consume around :<br>  1800 cals daily :: 50% carbs 30% protien 20% fats (good fats)<br>  <br>  If you find it difficult to curb your hunger, i suggest eating more frequently throughout the day, say 4-5 meals a day every 2-3 hours. This along with slow eating causes your body to increase your METABOLISM and its this which burns your fat. <br>  <br>  If you continue to eat such little a day, at first you may have a quick spike of weight loss, but in the long run, your matabolism will slow right down due the the fact that the body thinks its starving and that food is limited, therefore slowing down body efficientcy to keep the fat longer to keep you alive longer.<br>  <br>  Last tip i can suggest is decrease the carbs and increase the protien, this will cause you to feel less hungry.<br>  <br>  Few examples of good carbs are : rice (brown is best), pasta (brown is best which is wholegrain) wheat and oats, jacket potatoes. try to keep sugar low however do consume sugars from fruits and pure fruit juices.<br>  As for Fats, try to consume a couple of handful of nuts a day, these kinds of nuts may include, brazil nuts, almonds and pine nuts. As well as this, the best fats to consume come from oily fish. This can be tinned fish with oils in like sunflower oil, olive oil. All other fishes contain the best fats in too. mackeral, tuna and salmon are best advised.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and i hope your weight goal is acheived healthely.|`|avc7ixnxaa	No, that's not healthy at all.

e626WZNDaa	Hi, first of all its obvious you don't love this guy and that's not a good relationship to be in. no one will blame you for divorcing him - ur just not the right people for one another. Secondly, u need to learn that people do love you, despite what happened in the past. i'm sure your family love you very much, altho they might not show it. maybe you should think about counseling, or just learn to love yourself! i no how it is to come from a household where ppl lack civiliaty and communication skills, but part of the not feeling loved is under valueing yourself by not loving you. hope i helped|`|d5nuFV24aa	My answer is to just leave him or divorce him. if you dont love him then its only hurting you to stay with him......and yes i understand that most ppl havent been in your situation but you need to keep your chin up and let ppl say what they're gonna say cuz you cant stop them.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.

Your mother has her idea of what is right and you have your idea of what you would like - and the 2 aren't the same.<br>  <br>  You could try asking he what she is scared of?

4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Yes, I do. My wife is bipolar. <br>  <br>  In any case, it is difficult to say what will happen with your son. You don't really provide enough information. I will say this, though: if your son visits his doctor regularly, takes his medication as prescribed, communicates about his feelings with his wife, you, and his doctors, reports any changes in moods as they happen, gets plenty of exercise, and gets some counseling... there is absolutely no reason for him not to lead a perfectly normal life. My wife does these things, and sure she has some bad days, but overall her life is no different than yours or mine. The doctors are the experts. The secret to success is to communicate with them and do exactly what they say. His wife's "pushing" should be completely irrelevant to this. In fact, better he be pushed than for her to let him lapse. In the end, though, his destiny is in his own hands.<br>  <br>  I might add that having your support will be a good thing, too. Encourage him to do the things above, and be a good listener. Do that, and you will be contributing to his condition in a positive way. Good luck!|`|QnpyKmkzaa	Yes id .The person with the disorder is me. I have only know it for about a year and a half ago. They put me on this percription to help me with it.

This might require a little more effort, but you will be much happier at the end.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	forget cartoons, watch porn|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Nothing is wrong with porn. At 16, it's a good alternative to a girlfriend.|`|hL4nWbzmaa	How to avoid porn addiction on the Internet<br>  <br>  1. Consider installing porn content filtering software( Strongly Recommend NetDog ,you can get it from www.netdogsoft.com ) on your computer. it will help to protect you from stumbling into pornography by accident, That's important.<br>  <br>  2. Do not try to guess what the address of a Web page is. Many pornographic sites have similar addresses of respectable sites. For example www . whitehouse . com is a porn site. The real address is www. whitehouse . gov<br>  <br>  3. Never click on Web site addresses that you receive in an unsolicited email.<br>  <br>  4. Do not open attachments that come in email that are unsolicited.<br>  <br>  5. Use filtered search engines or reputable directories to find the information you need.<br>  <br>  6. Do not search for terms like girls. Think before you enter a search term.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stick with reputable sites.<br>  If something looks questionable, don't let curiosity get the best of you.

zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free. also for those wanting sexy hot abs. a nice toned stomach comes from a body with low body fat. so if ur overweight and u do a million crunches or any ab workout you r wasting your time!!! cant see the muscles under fat. low body fat equals=a nice flat toned stomach. <br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. Yes. You should. Just remember sometimes you will gain muscle mass and that's a good thing. Keep up the good work. Peace|`|aNbYThzsaa	No, not at all. From personal experience I joined the track team and ran every day 5-8 miles and still eat my regualr meals and I didnt loose a pound! Why because a diet is the most important thing when it comes to weight loss, excersize is only meant to tone up. In fact it is a common mistake to do running, swimming or any high intensity excersize, why? Because you appetite goes way up. It is very hard to keep calorie count low and at the same time do high intensity excersize. Do what I do, walk! Walking burns similar fat calories as running without the drastic increases in appetite. All in all, diet is the key component to loosing weight. Read weightloss magazines, none of them ever recomend tons of excersize. Britney spears lost 30 pounds by abiding by a strict 1,200 calorie diet and just walked on the treatmeal for 30 minutes every day. She said she never ran and tones up by doing situps and some weights. If you reeally like to run or anything related to high impact excersize it is better to leave that at the end of your weightloss journey to tone up.
8s2Bybysaa	That happened to me when i was ten, and mine was really bad and always in the same nostril. I thought it was just normal, but when it was bleeding it was literally like a tap, So we went doctors and apparently i must have had a heavy cold and i burst a blood vessel. It was nothing serious, he said that it happens to lots of people. So i had to have a minor opration just to get it sealed again. From that day on, no more nose bleeds. I dont think it will be anything serious, but its worth getting it checked out, becasue it is so inconvienient and yeah it always happens at a rong time!! Hope this helps! x|`|Ziyl4xNMaa	My brothers used to get them everyday! The doctor said that it was normal. We were kind of aggravated with her answer at first but it eventually calmed down.

Go to some classes at a gym and find out what you like - then you're more likely to stick to it forever. :)|`|AA11447210	Keep reminding yourself of the results you are seeking...what you will look like, how you will feel.<br>  <br>  Then, make your exercise workout like an appointment. It's an obigation, not an option. During the week my routine is arrive home from work, change into my workout clothes and workout...I don't allow myself time to relax or get distracted because then the chances of my motivation leaving me increase. I treat my workout as something that is a standard part of my day/routine. If I'm invited out in the evening (for example) or after work, I cannot go until after my workout. It's that simple. Workouts do not get skipped (I might change the time of day I do them, but I do not skip them).<br>  <br>  As for your eating, this is a lifestyle change, not a diet. You need to accept that to keep the weight off you have to keep eating better (healthy) forever. An occasional treat is fine, but this is your new way of life (or should be)...it's not a matter of staying on your 'diet', it's a matter of eating sensibly and accepting your new lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Good luck! ?

LN2nIbeCaa	I would not recommend Depo.  Some women have great experiences with it, some stop getting their periods even.<br>  <br>  For me, I had bleeding almost constantly while on it.  They kept telling me to give it another cycle, well, that lasted for a year and a half.  I would have one week a month of NOT bleeding instead of the other way around.<br>  <br>  Also, Depo has been black boxed by the FDA because it causes bone loss, which puts you at a much higher risk of getting osteoporosis later on in life.|`|O7XNLEXlaa	I have heard nothing but negative things resulting in the use of depo-provera. One friend of mine got a blood clot and had to stay in the hospital for two weeks. Another friend of mine had constant "break-thru" bleeding, and never wanted to have sex. The reason we have our period is to clean out all the unused blood and uterine lining that our body makes in case the traveling egg gets fertilized. The break-thru bleeding is a result of your body wanting to rid itself of all the stuff that is backing up. I'm not so sure it's the best idea to keep old blood and stuff in your uterus for too long -- and I imagine you'd feel bloated all of the time.<br>  <br>  If you're switching because taking the pill everyday at the same time is too much to remember, why don't you ask the doctor about the Nuva-Ring? It is not an IUD so theres no implanting it. It fits around the base of your cervix. You still get your period once a month, but it's less to remember. Just put a calendar alarm on your phone to remind you!<br>  <br>  Here's the website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nuvaring.com/Consumer/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuvaring.com/Consumer/index.a...</a>|`|DUxUndv8aa	I'll tell you about my experience and I hope it is helpful to you. I was on depo for a year or two and i never had a period while I was on it. Also while on it I gained 15 lbs, and began feeling depressed often. It also decreased my libido. The weight and depression did not go away until a year after I got off it. getting off depo was a good decision. It also took a whole year for my period to come back so I was concerned that I had lost my fertility altogether! A couple years after I decided to try the pill. I took that for a year and a half. I stopped taking that because it made me nauseous everyday the entire time i was on it. I also experienced weight gain and mood swings, but they were nothing compared to when I was on depo. Birth control affects everyone a little different so I can't predict how it will affect you. But in my opinion, based on my experience, I would not recommend depo. The only time I would recommend depo is if you do not have regular access to a pharmacy or something like that. Have you heard about IUD's? A friend of mine is an ob-gyn doctor and she says they are the best option out there, with minimum upkeep. She has one too. They last up to five years or more. I'm looking into my other options but haven't decided if I will try any more hormonal birth control as they seem to affect me more than other people. good luck with your decision!!|`|vsaaaSsAaa	90% of people on depo gain at least 10 lbs.  5% of people on depo will gain MASSIVE weight (100 or more).  <br>  <br>  Even if you stop getting the shots, the effects take a long time to wear off because the half-life of the drug is long.  Once it's in your system, it takes months to clear out.  <br>  <br>  This also causes a long lag if you decide to get pregnant.  (average time to start ovulating is 10 months-- some people take up to 2 years after discontinuing the shots).|`|AhhCbB2yaa	I would not reccommend it. While everyone has different side effects, I gained weight after getting on it, and became VERY depressed, like I could just have killed myself, it is not a good thing, try an IUD or something, never take something that doesnt let you have a period, cause they make you gain weight and pms X10.|`|eAupvb3taa	I personally loved Depo. I had no periods, no PMS and no weight gain. BUT...... I was on it for about 8 years and I just had a bone density test done. I don't have osteoporosis, but my doc did recommend I stop Depo and go back to BC pills. Just started again on Sunday. I'm 42. I do not take supplements (well, I do now). Depo does cause osteoporosis in some women but not all. You just have to monitor it. I LOVED Depo because it was so easy. I will miss that and no periods/cramps/PMS. Every person is different. I did great on it but others hate it. I would suggest you try it and see how you do, You can always stop and go back to the pill.|`|GIxctDDuaa	DON'T DO IT!!! I gained so much weight on depo provera is wasn't even funny. I gain more weight on that then when I was pregnant. Went from 145 after two kids to 215. Never went over 185 when pregnant. I had to get off just to lose the weight. And haven't even lost it all. :(
h6cAhPs6aa	if you have been checked by a doctor,  everything should be fine.  the only thing i can suggest is not to have such hard passionate sex. maybe after a while when you get use to his penis maybe it won't hurt anymore.  size can make a difference. start off slow then speed it up and see what happens.  have a couple of drinks to relax you a little,  then you won't feel any pain. maybe you have to relax and try not to tense up every time you have sex,  that could be a very good part of your problem.|`|AUOp1j5Saa	Try some different positions.<br>  Some sexual positions may be more rough on you than others.<br>  I experience a very similar thing when my cervix gets hit too hard and am unable to continue having sex.<br>  <br>  Have you tried being on top much?

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|UETorSQXaa	You are a good weight for your height.

Don't see it as losing weight, but leading a healthy lifestyle (this includes treat, fat and protein) and you will feel more positive about it. i found a good way to keep healthy is by walking, going on my bike (as this tones the whole body and increases balance and strength) and eating between 3-5 portions of fruit and veg. Plus, i don't think you av anything to worry about at 7stone 4 at 5ft2. im a similiar height and weight to you, and trust me its better to focus on toning the body (maybe 2 or 3 times a week) than going on any fad diets. but also if you wish to eat less, cut ur food intake by a small amount -20% at most, otherwise ur body begins to retain fat. hope that was useful.|`|sAegnwFMaa	PLEASE READ  THIS ALL BECAUSE THIS METHOD WILL REALLY HELP U<br>  Method : <br>  1. Stretch your meals to 20 minutes or longer. Your stomach, mouth and brain are all connected and it takes 20 minutes of chewing before your stomach signals your brain that you are full. To feel full and successfully lose weight on any weight loss program, you need to eat slowly for 20 minutes or longer.<br>  2. Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is important to your health, your normal diet and to help lose weight. Water is necessary for the metabolism of your stored fat. Weight loss cannot occur without an active metabolism which requires large quantities of water.<br>  Another way to use water to lose weight is to drink a large glass of ice water just before meals. The cold causes your stomach to shrink slightly which will make you feel full faster.<br>  3. The more positive your self-esteem, the better you feel about yourself, the faster and easier it will be for you to lose weight. When you are self-confident, you are better able to take charge of your life. It also means that after you lose weight, it will stay gone permanently.<br>  4. When you go fat free or low fat, you also cut out much of the taste of the foods you eat. Add the flavor back with herbs and spices. Strong flavors such as vinegar, garlic, chili powder, cayenne, curry powder, rosemary and tarragon can be used to doctor up any food you are eating. For your low fat and fat free diets, experiment with different herbs and spices until you find some you like. Staying on your fat free or low fat diet will be easier and your weight loss will be speeded up.<br>  5. Increase your metabolism by as much as 40% by using hot and spicy foods such as hot peppers of all varieties and mustards. Research shows these foods all increase your metabolism. For double duty, give up fat filled mayonnaise for mustard and add hot peppers to your food for greater flavor and increased metabolism.<br>  6. Negative emotions will also interfere with your weight loss program. It's difficult to stay motivated to lose weight when you feel bad. Overeating often accompanies negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, fear, guilt and anger.<br>  7. To lose weight faster, reduce your intake of caffeine. Caffeine leads to an increase of insulin in your body which retards the burning of your stored fat. This is a simple chemical reaction in your body that you can change. Reduce your caffeine intake by 50% and see what happens. Here is a rough guide to use when looking at the amount of caffeine you currently take in:<br>  Brewed coffee (6 oz. cup) - 100mg; Instant coffee (6 oz.) - 70mg; Tea (6 oz.) - 50mg; Soft drinks (12oz.) - (Coke, Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew) - 50mg; Dark chocolate (1 oz.) - 20mg Milk chocolate (1 oz.) - 6mg.<br>  8. Increase your intake of fiber rich foods. They will help fill you up faster and will help all the food you eat pass through your digestive system more easily.<br>  9. Exercise is probably the most important key to increasing your metabolism and burning off excess fat.<br>  Research shows that you burn more stored fat for energy when you do aerobic exercises on an empty stomach than on a full stomach. Research also shows that you burn more stored fat when you exercise late in the day rather than in the morning. Put together, the best time to exercise to lose weight by burning your stored fat is in the late afternoon/early evening before dinner. Second best is in the morning before breakfast.<br>  Our metabolism naturally starts to slow down about 8 hours after we wake up. Thirty minutes of aerobic exercises in the evening, before dinner, will not only burn off stored fat but it increases your metabolism for about two to three more hours just when it was starting to slow down. This produces a significant increase in fat burned off, even after the exercise is over.<br>  10. To lose weight quickly, never skip a meal. Your first meal after waking starts your metabolism. Your metabolism then speeds up for about eight hours and then starts slowing down until you go to sleep when it goes to low until you wake and eat and start the cycle again.<br>  Skip breakfast and your metabolism doesn't get started until lunch time. You've just missed three or four hours of fat burning time. When you skip meals during the day, your metabolism also slows down.<br>  Weight loss through the burning of stored fat is all about eating enough of the right kinds of foods so you stay full and your metabolism stays as high as possible.<br>  Remember, if you feel hungry, your metabolism slows down. Stay full with healthy, nonfattening foods and your metabolism will continue to burn your stored fat as fast as your body will allow.|`|pfTcgQBFaa	God people are so rude!<br>  <br>  Ok honey don't listen to the haters!<br>  <br>  This helped me lose 50lbs 2 times.<br>  <br>  *Very limited carbs (rice, bread, potatoes - better to eat them early in the morning or after working out)<br>  <br>  *Unlimited vegetables<br>  <br>  *Limited fruits<br>  <br>  *No juice or soda<br>  <br>  *lots and lots of water (like a gallon a day - sorry I don't know if that's your measurement)<br>  <br>  *No junk food (if it comes in a box or can don't eat it (use your judgement)<br>  <br>  Exercise at least 30 minutes a day (play, dance. walk, bike )<br>  <br>  You will lose weight !

mrndKIYvaa	I have had one natural birth and one medicated. The gallbladder pain you get from the attacks IMO is far worse than the surgery. The surgery pain is soreness and stiffness but you have to keep moving (similar to a c-section). <br>  <br>  I love Mexican too. I am on day 5 of recovery and just tried a steak fresco taco.

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	I have a hyper sensitive very fair skin and have found this trick to protect myself from skin harming and skin aging and allergy causing ingredients in many sunscreens(you can verify with web searches."Are sunscreens skin harming?").<br>  First, thoroughly massage grape seed oil or almond oil (olive oil is suitable for many skins also) into skin. They are especially suitable for spot prone sensitive skin Then splash with water and dab dry with tissues or an old towel and then apply sunscreen on top. The oils act as a barrier preventing sunscreen contact with skin. Surprisingly, it is equally, if not more protective. I spend many hours in intense Mexican sun with just ONE application of spf 15 sunscreen and I never burn and do not tan  - even slightly. Try it. You will be happy that you did.<br>  Massaging with oils keep skin healthy and young looking and can clear skin of all blemishes. It has rid me of ALL my many skin conditions and given me a virtually flawless, healthy and glowing skin. I have been using for many years and found it very rejuvenating. I am often thought to be many years younger than I am.<br>  <br>  SOURCE(S): 20+ years research safe, natural safe treatments and cures of skin conditions, skin enhancement and anti aging, rejuvenation treatments........|`|eaa4385420723c3abeb96d751668d71faa	I am allergic to most sun creams, Nivea included.<br>  The only one I have no problems with is P20- which is expensive but you only apply it once a day (which is fantastic)!!<br>  It allows you to get some colour, gradually over the course of your holiday, but you don't burn.<br>  I'll be honest though, if you want to go home with a tan, P20 wont give you that!!<br>  When you put it on, it feels a bit greasy but it dries within 15 minutes & then its like you have no sun cream on.<br>  I always get spots no matter what sun cream I use, but I get far less with P20 than with anything else.<br>  I'd try your cream before your holiday to see if you break out, and if you do, invest in some P20. :)
qHwI9ev8aa	You don't need to do anything special after such a short fast. Definitely start with water (go slowly and not ice water) and fruits will give you more liquids as well as quickly replenish your blood sugar. After that just pick some healthy foods and eat a little from each food group and have a small meal. <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to make sure you're getting enough fluids (water, juice, fruits and vegetables) to replace what you've lost in the last 21 hours.

NO ONE is perfect!)...once you can "see" what may be bothering you, you can deal with it more effectively and can change what you feel you need to until you like your results....practicing not only helps you develop better social skills, but also keeps you from feeling off kilter when you need to speak to a stranger....you'll be prepared!|`|qfSKgxDsaa	you do have anxiety.

u4FGBKi4aa	Raw Shea Butter is great....|`|SRFfaKbCaa	Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C such as blackcurrants, blueberries, broccoli, guava, kiwi fruits, oranges, papaya, strawberries and sweet potatoes; they all help to produce collagen that strengthens the capillaries that feed the skin. <br>  Make sure you get enough omega-3 and omega-6, both essential fatty acids. You will find omega-3 in oily fish, but plant sources like linseeds and flax oil are excellent, too. For omega-6 try safflower, sunflower and corn oils. <br>  Eating foods that contain sulphur can help to keep skin smooth - garlic and onions are ideal. <br>  Go for foods rich in vitamin E, such as almonds, avocado, hazelnuts, pine nuts and sunflower and corn oils. <br>  Zinc-rich foods, such as wheatgerm, liver, pumpkin seeds, sardines and oysters, help to repair skin damage and keep it soft and supple. <br>  Foods rich in vitamin A help new skin to grow. Liver, eggs, milk and oily fish are good sources along with fortified cereals and margarines. <br>  Eat a few dried apricots every day. They're full of iron to help improve your skin tone. So are sesame seeds - add them to cereals and muesli. <br>  Drink plenty of water to rehydrate your skin - aim for eight glasses a day. Tea, coffee and juices do count, but for really great skin stick to plain water and don't smoke. <br>  Of all the B vitamins vital for great skin, vitamin B2 or riboflavin helps your skin glow. Best sources include beef, cheese, eggs, liver and Marmite. <br>  Finally, once you make changes to your diet, don't expect an overnight miracle. It takes six weeks for new skin to emerge up to the surface, so the visible benefits from dietary changes will take just as long. So it's never too soon to start. <br>  Beat your skin problems<br>   Is it very dry? Dry, rough skin combined with coarse, dry and brittle hair (as well as tiredness) can be a sign of an underactive thyroid, so if you're worried, check with your GP. But for general dry skin problems, try increasing your intake of foods rich in beta-carotene (such as yellow and red peppers and dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach) and upping your intake of omega-3-rich oils. Add a teaspoon of flax oil to salad dressings or sprinkle some linseeds on your cereal daily. <br>  Is it itchy? Get some relief by opting for foods high in B vitamins, such as eggs, fish, lentils, nuts and wholegrains. B vitamins improve poor circulation, which is sometimes associated with itchiness. <br>  Is it oily? Cut down on processed and junk food as well as foods high in sugar, such as cakes and biscuits as well as hard fats. Dip bread in olive oil or hemp seed oil for a tasty treat instead of using butter. <br>  For acne? Try selenium-rich foods, such as Brazil nuts, cashew nuts, fresh tuna, sunflower seeds, walnuts and wholemeal bread. Combine with vitamin E for the best effect.

Since the intestines are hollow, bowel sounds can echo throughout the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water-pipes.<br>  The majority of bowel sounds are harmless and simply indicate that the gastrointestinal tract is working. A doctor can evaluate abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope (auscultation).<br>  Although the majority of bowel sounds are normal, there are some instances in which abnormal bowel sounds provide valuable information about the health of the body.<br>  Ileus is a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity. Many medical conditions may lead to ileus, but it is important to evaluate it further because gas, secretions, and intestinal contents can build up and rupture the bowel wall. The doctor may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen.<br>  Reduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds. They indicate a slowing of intestinal activity.<br>  Hypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep, and also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medications and after abdominal surgery. Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation.<br>  Increased (hyperactive) bowel sounds are sometimes heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds reflect an increase in intestinal activity. This can sometimes occur with diarrhea and after eating.|`|AA12227342	What???

ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,<br>  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower<br>  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and<br>  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have<br>  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone<br>  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.<br>  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.<br>  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and<br>  the environment can be strong factors.<br>  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around<br>  more,<br>  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability<br>  to gain weight may signal a condition<br>  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing<br>  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or<br>  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy. <br>  Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the<br>  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good<br>  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,<br>  stroke, and<br>  cancer. <br>  If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you<br>  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy<br>  weight loss, takes time and<br>  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.<br>  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight<br>  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the<br>  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,<br>  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann<br>  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,<br>  and a small amount of fat. <br>  Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to<br>  higher in fat or sugar. <br>  Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may<br>  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and<br>  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk<br>  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes. <br>  If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or<br>  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins<br>  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices<br>  versus the whole mango). <br>  Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal. <br>  Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to<br>  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake. <br>  With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as<br>  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel). <br>  Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good<br>  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you<br>  will enjoy. <br>  Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter<br>  sandwich.

aocf35epaa	push-ups are key|`|tIldpr7vaa	weights are essential to building mass, push ups and what not will only do so much|`|HVTXfd8Laa	Punch people in the face.|`|GuUQmMceaa	Well, there are many workouts available for increasing your bicep size.  The routine that i normally go through is a 50 set 10 rep each exercise that will pretty much buff up your whole body.  The bicep part of it in involves a lot of chin-ups and pull ups.  Push ups works your triceps, not your biceps.   Following the workout, be sure to digest a muscle building protein so that after your muscles have torn and are ripped open, they can heal with that protein, which will make them larger over time.<br>  <br>  First thing that my routine involves is starting out with Stretching, it doesn't sound like a huge deal, but when you work with weights, you REALLY want to stretch fairly well before and after you stretch so your muscles and body don't ache for days.  Also wait 30 seconds to 1 minute of rest between each workout unless your adept to the workout and want to get a little more "buck" for your workout.<br>  Always remember that for every pulling exercise, you need a pushing one.   Same goes with the amount of time between the exercise resting point and execution point, so if you push up for 1 second, be sure to take the same time as you retract.<br>  <br>  So the routine only involves dumbbells, a bar to lift yourself up, and a chair.<br>  <br>  First thing your going to do is bicep curls, 10 each arm with a decent weight.  <br>  Next is (what i call) a dumbbell chest press.  Basically the same thing as a bench, but you lay on the ground with your dumbbells in your hands and crook them at a 45 degree angle and push straight up and down. 10 reps<br>  next do 10 chin-ups (or as many as you can)<br>  next a overhead press. 10 reps<br>  next do 10 "lawn mowers" on each arm basically pick up the dumbbell and pull it up like your trying to pull the rope on a lawnmower. <br>  10 cross body flies<br>  10 under chair pull ups, where you have dumbbells in both hands and you sit in the chair, keeping your back straight, bend slightly over your lap and lift the weights up to your ribs then put the weights back under the chair and repeat <br>  10 pull-ups (or as many as you can)<br>  10 corkscrew flies<br>  10 "Trains", about the same as a lawnmower except you do it with both arms going simultaneously, like right arm up then down, as soon as the right arm is down lift the left arm and repeat 10 times for each arm.  <br>  and then i believe the last exercise is called 8s. <br>  <br>  This is where you get 4 different weight sets and start with the max and do 8 bicep curls with the max weight, take a 5 second break, then lift the next lowest weight and lift 8 times, wait 5 seconds, lift the next lowest 8 times wait 5 seconds and then the last weight 8 times and your done.<br>  <br>  After your workout remember to eat a lot of protein or drink a protein shake.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, just stick with a workout that you find that fits you and you should see results.  This workout has made my biceps grow 2.25 inches in 3 months.

BE9viMEMaa	When I was a teenager, I used to feel like my bones were aching, too.  Keep an eye on it, see a doctor if it gets worse, but I think you'll probably be OK.  I don't think you should take ibuprofen, though, unless it's excruciating.  Not that I've done any scientific research, but it seems like everyone I know who takes pain pills are the biggest weenies in the world and take some sort of pain killer for some sort of pain almost every single day.  It's really annoying.  I think they de-sensitize you, so that any pain you get, feels worse than it should be...|`|7z6BWoESaa	sounds like you are getting the flu|`|2NtwlyO2aa	it could be what has been going around.

Bsi4olK9aa	I had this fear also some 10+ years ago.  Learn everything you can about them.  With only a few exceptions, nearly all spiders in generally are harmless and non aggressive when handled; they are also facinating creatures.  Identify the poisonous ones in your region so you know what to avoid and identify the most common nonpoisonous spiders so you know what not to fear.  Note that spiders compete for territory.  Wolf spiders for example will keep the Hobo spiders away but if you kill them, then the poisonous hobo might enter your home after the competition is gone.|`|1WS4vTdcaa	Chinosis and EFT are good and there's a link to a video below that shows someone getting over their fear of spiders using Chinosis - though of course you might not want to watch it as it does have a spider in it.

DjRCYuLXaa	well are you healthier now?  Or are you too thin? one way to get a general guideline is to look at your BMI index (this site can calculate it for you <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/</a> ) if you fall in the normal range then don't worry about it.  If you're under weight try increasing the amount of calories you eat.  Still eat fruits and veggies, but also increase the amount of meat and  protein you eat as well as the bread and complex carbohydrates (like pasta)<br>  <br>  Don't over do it on sweets because they are 'empty calories' without many nutrients you could gain weight into a normal range but still loose your health by getting a vitamin deficiency|`|g2h6qUUXaa	stay the way you are being chubby isn't healthy|`|AA11481959	Get married|`|CHPRUwj9aa	yeah, chubby girls are really attractive. so start taking a little exercise. exercise can help gain weight as effeciently as it helps reduce weight but adopt some normal intensity exercise and do on the regular basis. exercise will improve yuor digestion and efficient digestion means your body will automaticaly demand more food and you will eventually start to gain weight.|`|0DSQAIM9aa	okay, that's a problem. Usually people say those things because you've changed. It's not a bad thing! STAY SKINNY!!! being chubby isn't the worst case scenario, but it's still unhealthy. If you really want to though, eat more, exercise less.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|SRFfaKbCaa	I'd say to eat 1500 a day and walk an hour a day sounds silly but it really works!..take the starch out of your diet too like bread,pasta,rice,potatoes,cereal ect but it's ok to have like egg on toast in the morning as you need it for energy..I'd eat this to loss weight fast<br>  <br>  one egg on toast and a skim milk protien power shake with a banana or low fat yogurt and a half grape fruit and toast with alittle butter and cinnamon on it <br>  2 hrs later egg a apple ..for lunch have a chicken salad and some grapes, have another apple an hour later.. for dinner,beef,chicken or fish with veggies and don't eat after 7pm drink a glass of water every hour your up in the day and power walk!..at least an hour straight a day|`|F8EnH6JQaa	A DIET IS WHAT YOU EAT....there for we are all on a diet....<br>  THINK LIFESTYLE CHANGE<br>  <br>  You got the change the way you think and feel about food<br>  <br>  TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  The first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your body adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  <br>  Don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package....<br>  .....THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD.....<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  NO white BREAD or SUGAR<br>  <br>  NO FRIED FOOD...<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

NhF9sM5jaa	It sounds very much like you are getting your first period<br>  Start wearing panty liners to school to save yourself from and accident and to control the blood until you can get to the bathroom and put on a pad or tampon<br>  <br>  For your first year or so, or until you become sexually active, I would suggest a pad. "Always" makes a really good thinner one with wings. The wings help the pad stay in place. The pad is not bulky, but has enough padding so it should last you up to 8 hours. Dont wear anything longer than that.<br>  <br>  It is the best non bulky pad I have found and I have heavy heavy periods. I am 20 years old by the way and got my first period when I was 12.<br>  <br>  Hot water bottles and Midol or Pamprin help for cramps. Always choose tylenol over advil.<br>  <br>  Try not to lie down too much cus this will make clots form easier.

It sounds like the pain you're having is higher up than that so I don't think you're about to have a period, you're probably just ill. It's also quite unusual for people to have pain when the first start their period. Everyone I know took anywhere from 1-5 years before they started getting pain.|`|7iIh5QmOaa	it sounds like your getting close to that time. and don't stress not everyones periods are the same. yes there are some cramping but nothing to make you immobilized if so seek a doctor. relax drink some hot tea. it cramping hurts take some tylenol, motrin, alieve, advil or something. or hot water bottle on your stomach. hope you feel better.

It looks like small bumps, and is common on the upper arms and thighs, it always seems worse in Winter, than Summer. A good moisturizer can help, it may be best to speak to your pharmicist who can perhaps recommend a good one for this condition.

WMR8hVlfaa	I don't think it's a case of increased fertility so much as it's very easy to go back to regular fertility after you stop taking the pills vs. other hbc methods, such as the shot, which delay fertility for a while after you stop taking them.<br>  <br>  This article is interesting: <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/news/20020827/birth-control-pills-may-aid-fertility" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/n...</a>|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	No, stopping BC pills will not make you more fertile. Doctors recommend Natural Family Planning as the safest means of birth control, and couples who practice NFP have a divorce rate of 3%, while couples who contracept have a divorce rate of 60%.|`|DjRCYuLXaa	It may prevent you from getting pregnant for a couple months after you get off the birth control. After that I don't see any reason it should alter fertility more than any other hormonal birth control including Morena- one of the two types of IUDs sold in the us.  The other type of IUD has copper in it which changes the consistency of the uterine lining thus preventing eggs from implanting and sperm from swimming.<br>  <br>  You still ovulate while on the copper IUD, birth control pills and mirena both prevent ovulation, maybe this plays a role in fertility, as you have more eggs in your body after a year on hormonal birth control than you would after a year on a copper IUD.

It was a lot easier for me to talk to someone who had gone through it and made it to the other side they show you by working the steps and living one day at a time even one moment at a time you can live a sober life witch is a hard thing for your husband to see right now I know that if he had a choice he would be done with all this but he is past that point of choice he now needs to learn how to live sober again how to deal with life with out a drink <br>  You can go to a book store and get the some info on the program and the 12 steps the names are "the big book" "the twelve step traditions" I hoped I have helped I really feel for you please feel free to contact me if you need to talk more about this you are not alone go to AL-anon it will help you need to think about you too!:)<br>  www.recoverysuperstore.com<br>  www.e-aa.org

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

This method has worked for me and is really efficient.

D9GKS6cXaa	did you try p90x the method they use is mucle confusion the more you mix it up the differen't exersises you do the more response your going to get from your mucles . What happens is if you do diffren't exercises your mucles won't have time to get used to the routines . they will keep changing your routines for three months so you will all ways feel chalenged and with chalenge comes change. All you need is a pair of dumb bells or risisten't bands and one hour of exercise every day . Its a couple of dvds so you can do it at home.<br>  <br>  p.s its not going to be easy its going to be hard and thats good
Rp1piRCbaa	If you're 5ft 9" and 170lb it sounds like you're in pretty good shape already. A healthy number of calories per day is about 2000 to 2500 for an adult male - in your case a good way to gain muscle would be to take up a sport if you haven't already; doing weights in the gym can be harmful for people under a certain age (15-16) so you should ask a professional about that. The 2000 calories is a sensible start, though, and make it lean meats, trim off excess sweet foods and snacks and you can make that target no problem|`|E1u6LeJUaa	Everyone is different, go to a dietician.

When I left they all told me they were sorry to see me go.. but trust me before the job I was just like you would turn beet red if anyone acknowledged me.. its just a social thing really once you get into the swing more being shy will just go away. Friendliness is a good thing and if they are already approaching you and like you then you have nothing to worry about shouldn't be too long now, just keep it up stay in the public working and you'll be fine! Good Luck! I am rooting for ya! ?|`|cku5S9WLaa	I'm really shy as well but trust me this experience is going to do you a world of good.

However, strengthening your kegel muscles is a great way to have more control during sex, which may help you reach orgasm faster. Always use safe sex practices, and never be body-conscious! I really hope no one pokes fun at this...|`|ikLOBkOYaa	It just means that during sex - your pelvic musicals are contracting and expanding and in return your "hallway" is expanding and tightening - pulling in and releasing air.  It doesnt mean its tight or big - either would do the same thing and you should not be embarrassed about it - both persons should totally feel comfortable with each other and the natural bodily functions during sex and enjoy the moment!!!
I40iBJdHaa	ok, this is going to sound really weird, but i'm not making it up. i have read that actresses and models do this for two weeks before going on the red carpet. lay on your back and put a big ice pack on your breasts for a half hour. in two weeks they will be much more perky! unfortunately if you don't keep doing this though, they go back to normal. worth a try i guess, it couldn't hurt. if you try it let me know if it worked!|`|qeR967J7aa	Pectoral exercises will help some.

Repeat for 2-3 sets of<br>  8-12 repetitions.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Yes, it is possible. 16 pounds more than likely, but still very close. Theres no exercise to make certain body parts slimmer. Your body takes it off wherever it feels needs to go first. Keep up the exercise. Dont over do it.

tIldpr7vaa	Food is the best supplement for gaining muscle there is. <br>  Ur already taking whey protein and creatine thats enough, because anything else is a pointless waste money. Most supps out there r over priced BS, that do little of anything.<br>  <br>  Supps wont make u gain muscle, hard work in the gym and eating right will. Building muscle takes time, hard work and patients.

T72COWC8aa	Yes it will go away as you get older... I used to have it until my mid 20's, it was incredibly annoying. I am in my 30's now & get a pimple here & there (I have oily skin) somehow the symptoms diminished greatly. <br>  <br>  My girlfriend is 27 asking me the same question, she has oily skin also & is prone to acne or outbreaks. It is getting less worse than it was. She uses Proactiv but had limited success although I find her skin & complexion is much better & healthier looking. <br>  <br>  I take 2 showers a day. Once in the morning & at night before I go to bed. It eliminates the blocked pours & keeps my skin less oily & more clean.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|kvrYJ9eYaa	It will go away if you follow a healthy lifestyle. Adult acne is becoming ever more common in today's world due to our unhealthy lives we lead. Eating properly, drinking lots of water and washing your skin regularly with proper face wash that wont dry your skin out will help a lot.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Yes! It will go away. It just takes time.<br>  <br>  What avenues have you gone down?<br>  Have you seen a doctor/derm? Tried medications?<br>  <br>  Do you eat healthily? <br>  Have you tried cutting dairy out of your diet?<br>  <br>  Do you drink a lot of water?<br>  <br>  What lotions do you use?  I don't think people need excess chemicals on their skin. Try just using water (no soap) and baby wipes. See if you notice a difference.<br>  <br>  Try sudocrem.<br>  Try honey. It's full of anti bacterial properties.<br>  <br>  There are so many things that you can try.|`|iSNtznE3aa	It'll go away eventually, yes. At 21, your body is still going through a few changes. Once those settle down, the acne should go away. Shouldn't take too much longer.<br>  <br>  Also, some people have a skin condition that causes them to have acne. My mom is 52, but she has one of those skin conditions so she has terrible acne. If you are really concerned, go to the dermatologist and ask them.
4JjJtcWgaa	Smoke weed. I know it sounds cliche, but it was the only thing that got me through the consequences of my binges in the past.<br>  <br>  oh, and whats the deal with everyone saying their "clean". I never thought of myself as that way, I just kinda stopped because I didn't like the way my life was going. Being able to actually notice a lack of brain cells after a long ecstasy binge was reason enough.<br>  <br>  edit: kj, that is possible the worst answer ever. You're basically saying she will always have the cravings and will need perscription drugs to cope. Thats not true at all. <br>  <br>  All you need to do is stuff to take your mind off the cravings and they will fade away. Weed is one, but it could be a job, hobby, whatever. Your only still feeling the cravings because your thinking about them. Try to do stuff to ignore it. Perscription drugs (the reason your here in the first place), are not the answer. I used to think adderal (which is amphetamine) was miracle substitute for coke too.<br>  <br>  and yeah, weed is an herb, not a drug, which is why you should light it up and hit that ****.|`|5xTFyrzCaa	You can't stop your cravings.

Remember it is never satisfying, its a vicious cycle where you spend your life only wanting more. <br>  Remember you didn't even enjoy it when you were high because you were already thinking about your next 'time'. <br>  <br>  Think about the homeless guy or lady with no teeth or black tooth numbs scrounging around looking for that one 'last' time. <br>  <br>  You are past the hardest part don't make that all for waste.<br>  <br>  See a psychiatrist you are depressed - meth won't help you but anti-depressants will.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	the people ive talked to say that the cravings never go away.<br>  you should start going to support groups, ive heard it really helps
NhF9sM5jaa	no hun<br>  for the first year or two, your period will be changing a lot to adjust to what is right for your body. The heaviness,pain and possible even when it comes, will all change.<br>  <br>  If the pain becomes super severe or your period lasts longer than 8 days and it is really heavy, see a doctor. They can discuss options to help regulate it or atleast help the blood and pain ease to a more comfortable level<br>  <br>  Always take tylenol over advil. Ibuprofen doesn't work as well as acetomenaphin for pain.<br>  <br>  Try not to lie down too much or you can make it worse. Sit up, walk around the house a bit, or if you can handle it, get some light exercise.<br>  <br>  Also don't take extremely hot showers because you risk the chance of getting dizzy and fainting<br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck|`|okgr5aPCaa	No, don't worry, you're fine.<br>  When you first start your periods they are almost always irregular... meaning they can last longer or shorts, come later or earlier every time, look different.<br>  <br>  It can take a few years for your periods to get into a regular cycle so don't worry.|`|DjRCYuLXaa	Your period will be kind of weird for a while, it is normal.  It may be irregular, painful or heavy.  Mine never lasted more than 9 days but  yours could be different.  As long as it doesn't smell really bad (not simply different like you might have smelled last time)  I wouldnt worry.<br>  <br>  If you use tampons, I would check to make sure you didn't leave one in and put a second one in there with it.|`|p3iKqdh8aa	There's nothing wrong with you girrrll :)<br>  It takes at least 3 years for a period to become regular, and in pattern!

If he's getting a bloody nose every morning, it's definitely severe enough that I would recommend seeing a doctor.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  That definitely sounds like it's a sinus issue.

dpgXzMenaa	You put it in by aiming upward instead of backward... it runs into the front wall of your vagina that way and it *hurts* (and wedging yourself open that way will allow your period blood to come out easily... it's not your hymen breaking.).<br>  <br>  The ones with plastic applicators *definitely* make things easier for girls who've never used tampons before... but once you know how, anything that's comfortable to wear will be easy to insert. If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|sK70xjpaaa	Hmmmmm idk why it would do that.It didnt do that to me, you should tell your mom or gardian then go to the doctors|`|IxOtmbY4aa	Most women who use tampons already have there hymen broken. Using tampons for the frist time are really uncomforable. You should take out the tampon every 3-4 hours, and/or your bleeding threw it. Do continue to go slow putting it in and taking it out, and sorry to hear your hymen broke! If you think it's not far enough in, (sorry folks) use your finger to push it in alittle more. Have fun using tampons! :]|`|9Q3wfQpPaa	go to wikipedia. type in hymen. it should tell you everything you need to know. you might have a specific type of hymen that is/was closed all the way, and you could have broken it with the tampon. hope this helps. <br>  <br>  p.s.- go talk to your nurse about it if you want to.

Cabbage Soup Recipe ? 7 Day Plan ? Experiences ? Health ? Discussion<br>  If you have a special occasion coming up, or you simply need to lose weight fast, the Cabbage Soup Diet may be just what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  cabbage imageAlthough not suitable for long-term weight loss, the Cabbage Soup Diet is a low-fat, high-fiber diet that will help you get into shape fast before you embark on a more moderate long-term eating plan.<br>  <br>  Pros and Cons of the Cabbage Soup Diet<br>  <br>  Pros: You'll lose weight fast, and can get as much of the foods listed in the program as you want. Although the diet is only for seven days (and shouldn't be adhered to for longer), it provides a great "kick-start" for a more moderate diet.<br>  <br>  Cons: Some people find the soup bland. Some people have reported feeling light-headed, weak, and have suffered from decreased concentration (although some who have been affected in this way felt it was well worth it, since it was only for a week and they had lost considerable weight).<br>  <br>  What the Cabbage Soup Diet is NOT<br>  <br>  The cabbage soup diet is sometimes referred to as the "Mayo Clinic Diet", and the "Sacred Heart Hospital Diet". Interestingly, this diet has nothing to do with either the Mayo Clinic, nor any Sacred Heart Hospital we know about.<br>  <br>  The Problem With Most "Mainstream" Diets<br>  <br>  Most diets - especially "mainstream" diets, and those recommended by major medical institutions - work slowly but surely, resulting in around 1 pound of weight loss per week.<br>  <br>  This "slow and steady" way to lose weight is certainly healthy, but suffers from one significant drawback : most people get discouraged and quit whatever diet they are on if they don't see results quickly.<br>  <br>  Seven Keys to Success<br>  <br>  1. Follow the diet religiously.<br>  2. Drink at least 4 glasses of water per day<br>  3. Keep in mind that it's only seven days<br>  4. Complement the diet with a good multivitamin tablet<br>  5. Print the information on this site so you can refer to it daily<br>  6. Eat plenty of soup - as much as you want! Do not try to starve yourself or you'll probably cheat and break the diet<br>  7.

Cut the green-pepper into bite size pieces and add to pot.<br>  <br>  Take the outer leafs layers off the cabbage, cut into bite size pieces, add to pot.<br>  <br>  Clean carrots, cut into bite size pieces, and add to pot.<br>  <br>  Slice mushrooms into thick slices, add to pot.<br>  <br>  If you would like a spicy soup, add a small amount of curry or cayenne pepper now.<br>  <br>  You can use beef or chicken bouillon cubes for seasonings. These have all the salt and flavors you will need.<br>  <br>  Use about 12 cups of water (or 8 cups and the V8 juice), cover and put heat on low. Let soup cook for a long time - two hours works well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember: This diet should only be followed for 7 days at a time, with at least two weeks in between.<br>  <br>  <br>  Day One:<br>  Fruit: Eat all of the fruit you want (except bananas). Eat only your soup and the fruit for the first day. For drinks- unsweetened teas, cranberry juice and water.<br>  <br>  Day Two:<br>  Vegetables: Eat until you are stuffed will all fresh, raw or cooked vegetables of your choice. Try to eat leafy green vegetables and stay away from dry beans, peas and corn. Eat all the vegetables you want along with your soup. At dinner, reward yourself with a big baked potato with butter. Do not eat fruit today.<br>  <br>  Day Three:<br>  Mix Days One and Two: Eat all the soup, fruits and vegetables you want. No Baked Potato.<br>  <br>  Day Four:<br>  Bananas and Skim Milk: Eat as many as eight bananas and drink as many glasses of skim milk as you would like on this day, along with your soup. This day is supposed to lessen your desire for sweets.<br>  <br>  Day Five:<br>  Beef And Tomatos: Ten to twenty ounces of beef and up to six fresh tomtoes. Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water this day to wash the uric acid from your body. Eat your soup at least once this day. You may eat broiled or baked chicken instead of beef (but absolutely no skin-on chicken). If you prefer, you can substitute broiled fish for the beef one one of the beef days (but not both).<br>  <br>  Day Six:<br>  Beef and Vegetables: Eat to your heart's content of beef and vegetables this day.

LN2nIbeCaa	Please turn your caps lock key off, you don't need to scream.<br>  <br>  Anyway...<br>  You would not have symptoms of early pregnancy only a week after having sex.  Fertilization alone can take up to 3 days, and another few to several days for the egg to implant.  So, your "morning sickness" could not have been morning sickness at this point in time.<br>  <br>  However, you can still get a period or two when you first become pregnant.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Simple ways are just to eat healthier.  No more sodas or caffeine and have a strick diet of veggie, fruits and fish or chicken.  Just by doing this you will notice your tummy shrink.|`|sAegnwFMaa	Method : <br>  1. Stretch your meals to 20 minutes or longer. Your stomach, mouth and brain are all connected and it takes 20 minutes of chewing before your stomach signals your brain that you are full. To feel full and successfully lose weight on any weight loss program, you need to eat slowly for 20 minutes or longer.<br>  2. Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is important to your health, your normal diet and to help lose weight. Water is necessary for the metabolism of your stored fat. Weight loss cannot occur without an active metabolism which requires large quantities of water.<br>  Another way to use water to lose weight is to drink a large glass of ice water just before meals. The cold causes your stomach to shrink slightly which will make you feel full faster.<br>  3. The more positive your self-esteem, the better you feel about yourself, the faster and easier it will be for you to lose weight. When you are self-confident, you are better able to take charge of your life. It also means that after you lose weight, it will stay gone permanently.<br>  4. When you go fat free or low fat, you also cut out much of the taste of the foods you eat. Add the flavor back with herbs and spices. Strong flavors such as vinegar, garlic, chili powder, cayenne, curry powder, rosemary and tarragon can be used to doctor up any food you are eating. For your low fat and fat free diets, experiment with different herbs and spices until you find some you like. Staying on your fat free or low fat diet will be easier and your weight loss will be speeded up.<br>  5. Increase your metabolism by as much as 40% by using hot and spicy foods such as hot peppers of all varieties and mustards. Research shows these foods all increase your metabolism. For double duty, give up fat filled mayonnaise for mustard and add hot peppers to your food for greater flavor and increased metabolism.<br>  6. Negative emotions will also interfere with your weight loss program. It's difficult to stay motivated to lose weight when you feel bad. Overeating often accompanies negative emotions such as depression, anxiety, fear, guilt and anger.<br>  7. To lose weight faster, reduce your intake of caffeine. Caffeine leads to an increase of insulin in your body which retards the burning of your stored fat. This is a simple chemical reaction in your body that you can change. Reduce your caffeine intake by 50% and see what happens. Here is a rough guide to use when looking at the amount of caffeine you currently take in:<br>  Brewed coffee (6 oz. cup) - 100mg; Instant coffee (6 oz.) - 70mg; Tea (6 oz.) - 50mg; Soft drinks (12oz.) - (Coke, Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew) - 50mg; Dark chocolate (1 oz.) - 20mg Milk chocolate (1 oz.) - 6mg.<br>  8. Increase your intake of fiber rich foods. They will help fill you up faster and will help all the food you eat pass through your digestive system more easily.<br>  9. Exercise is probably the most important key to increasing your metabolism and burning off excess fat.<br>  Research shows that you burn more stored fat for energy when you do aerobic exercises on an empty stomach than on a full stomach. Research also shows that you burn more stored fat when you exercise late in the day rather than in the morning. Put together, the best time to exercise to lose weight by burning your stored fat is in the late afternoon/early evening before dinner. Second best is in the morning before breakfast.<br>  Our metabolism naturally starts to slow down about 8 hours after we wake up. Thirty minutes of aerobic exercises in the evening, before dinner, will not only burn off stored fat but it increases your metabolism for about two to three more hours just when it was starting to slow down. This produces a significant increase in fat burned off, even after the exercise is over.<br>  10. To lose weight quickly, never skip a meal. Your first meal after waking starts your metabolism. Your metabolism then speeds up for about eight hours and then starts slowing down until you go to sleep when it goes to low until you wake and eat and start the cycle again.<br>  Skip breakfast and your metabolism doesn't get started until lunch time. You've just missed three or four hours of fat burning time. When you skip meals during the day, your metabolism also slows down.<br>  Weight loss through the burning of stored fat is all about eating enough of the right kinds of foods so you stay full and your metabolism stays as high as possible.<br>  Remember, if you feel hungry, your metabolism slows down. Stay full with healthy, nonfattening foods and your metabolism will continue to burn your stored fat as fast as your body will allow.|`|3q9Omtqaaa	All the doctors and nutritionists say targeted weight loss is not feasible, especially in the waist and belly zones, but I managed it with acai berry.

LN2nIbeCaa	Plan B can affect your periods, but it won't make the pill less effective.  Your risk of getting pregnant isn't higher than it would be if you hadn't taken it, but as you know even being on the pill there is a small chance you can get pregnant. <br>  <br>  You should know that pulling out does not work.  <br>  <br>  In the future you might not want to randomly have sex with a guy that you don't know if you'd want him to be the father of your child.  In addition to that, while your chances of getting pregnant might be low due to being on the pill, your chance of contracting an STD are very high by having unprotected sex with a stranger.  A little unsolicited advice?  Wait a few weeks and then see your gyno for an STD screening.

After taking a cup of coffee you can hardly go into the deep sleep(you can hardly detect any diffeence in your sleep) but in reality its not the sleep a tired body actually wants result= you feel tiredness the next day. and htis thing keeps going on..|`|DpN6MCvSaa	Well there could be a ton of reasons for that. <br>  <br>  Some reasons may be: not eating the right foods, or not eating enough food (if you are eating a lot of junkfood, or at the opposite end of the spectrum, are on a diet and not eating enough food during the day), you could also need to exercise more, and/or you may need to drink more water. <br>  <br>  If improving on all of the above does not help, I would ask your doctor. You could have mono, the flu, etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kubJk2bTaa	Oh goodness it could be a variety of things! Here are some of the most common reasons you could find yourself getting fatigued easily.<br>   1. Depression - see a doctor to find the right medication for you<br>  <br>   2. poor nutrition- avoid foods in high sugar that can make you "crash" later<br>   3. Insufficient vitamins/ low iron<br>   <br>   4. lack of sleep- Go to bed the same time every night and get up the same time every morning (yes even on your days off!) Get at least 8 hrs of sleep. Avoid caffeine mid afternoon and on. Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature, invest in a sound machine to help block out noise and soothe your senses. <br>  <br>  5. lack of excercise- Exercise increases blood flow to the brain. Try going for a walk daily or choose an excercise the piques your interest.<br>  swimming, tennis, martial arts ect.<br>   I hope this helps. Good luck|`|e626WZNDaa	it depends what ur tired from. stress is often one of the root causes, if so herbal medication may help, e.g. korean ginsing and glucose. also try and get a regular sleeping pattern, and make sure you have enough sleep for you, as some people only need 5 to 6 whilst others may need up to ten. involve yourself in a fun exercise, which will naturally give you more energy and, of course, eat lots of fruit over sugary things.|`|Du1FrX3naa	Drink some low carb energy drinks, that way you dont get all that sugar that the reg. has, and it also could be what your eating.  Get some protiens, iron, and b12 in your body (meats, veg.) or the easy way is to get those multi. vitamin packs they sell at gnc, and remember what ever you try you have to maintain because your body is not going to change overnight, you have to break that lazy cycle|`|VH00G8Isaa	im like that too.<br>  i can get up to 10 hours of sleep and then after i wake up, i can be really tired an hour later and i just stay like that.<br>  you might be anemic; low on blood<br>  or have sleep apnea|`|omvCfow3aa	take some energy drinks regularly,fruits and boiled green vegetables and have some honey and gooseberries which are good refreshers|`|jHQc1tseaa	Get more rest!
8m6fJ6cXaa	Are you ADHD?|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Sugar. All "energy" drinks are just crammed with a ton of sugar and caffeine. The sugar goes into your blood stream very fast (high fructose corn syrup), it opens up your fat deposits to store more fat, and once the sugar has been taken from your blood and stored as fat, you expirience the crash (sleepyness) since it is no longer in your blood stream.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	Its the after crash. It tires you out, after the rush. Try drinking a different energy drink with less caffeine|`|3cadd65eddc6f38417900da929213671aa	I get the same thing when I drink them. Some people handle caffeine differently. I try to avoid them if I can. Caffine is just like a drug. It's really great when it's in your system, but when it starts to subside your body craves more to keep the "high" going. This is why you feel tired. Use a drink that has less caffine like Diet Pepsi or Pepsi Max. ;-)
AA10229962	I think Extense paid you to post this.|`|AA12198724	I have heard some really awful things about that stuff. It makes you think your junk has enlarged when its actually just swollen. I would get to the doctor immediately. That stuff should be banned it doesnt really work it actually makes your junk worse in the long run.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	From what I can tell, the way extenze essentially works is by providing temporary enlargement by basically attempting to get as much blood into the penis, thereby engorging it, and making it bigger.  If you watch the commercial carefully the fine print says the enlargement is only temporary, and that how they do it.  It's similar to how the Chinese used bee stings to enlarge the penis, other culture use weak poisons and other methods to do basically the same thing.<br>  <br>  Since you stopped taking it, wait a few more days, if this does not go away, go see a doctor immediately.|`|eCnU95ORaa	hahahahah|`|E23s2wSNaa	go take therapy

ItJzrvQ4aa	Whether your weight-loss strategy espouses carbs with no fat or<br>  protein with few carbs, there is one thing your plan most certainly<br>  recommends -- water. From the veggie-based Ornish diet to steak-loving<br>  Atkins (and virtually all diets in between) "drink lots of water" is<br>  part of the mantra. <br>  Nutritionist and American Dietetic Association spokeswoman Leslie<br>  Bonci, MPH-RD, says that the clinical implications are slight. <br>  "Obviously people are looking for ways to increase metabolism, but<br>  this is an very, very, small effect. We are talking about just a few<br>  calories a day." <br>  Bonci says the standard weight-loss plan dictates encouraging people<br>  to drink more water stems from the belief that the liquid fills the<br>  gut to make people feel fuller. <br>  "Some plans say that drinking water flushes fat out of your system,<br>  which is absolutely ridiculous," she says.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Yes, however it will take quite a long time without exercising. For example, doing this, you might only lose 2-4 pounds a month. <br>  <br>  Add in 30 mins of exercise. Start slow, even if its only 30 mins one time the first week. but each week, add either another day, or longer duration. <br>  <br>  by the end of the month, try to be at 30 mins 5 times a week, or 1 hour 5 times a week. <br>  <br>  After 2 weeks i started 50 mins a day 5 times a week and am down 18 pounds in 6 weeks now.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Yes, of course.  Water cleanses out your body.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  <br>  I don't think it will help with weight loss<br>  <br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a>  <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight ,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://topsecreteverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|t4F59gf2aa	Better than drinking melted butter.|`|cf958f585e81f35dda5c9e48e6f15eb2aa	They should. Drinking more water tends to make you feel fuller and you eat less that way.|`|pRF5LLloaa	The smaller portions sizes is the key.<br>  <br>  There are only two ways to lose weight.  Anyone that tries to tell you otherwise is just trying to steal you money.<br>  <br>  1) Eat fewer calories than you use.<br>  2) Use more calories than you eat<br>  <br>  In other words, eat less and exercise more.<br>  <br>  Smaller portion sizes fits Number 1.<br>  <br>  The water helps keep you stomach full, and reduces the "hunger pangs", but otherwise it does nothing else but make you pee a lot.<br>  <br>  In order to lose the most weight, you MUST get more exercise.  Start a routine where you walk a mile a day, then build that up to two miles.  All the while, continuing to reduce  portion sizes.|`|dUj7rP2haa	Drinking enough water is important for over all health.  It will also help fill you up and may offer a calorie free way to satisfy your thirst (in comparison to cola or fruit juice).  Will you loose weight?  Maybe, it depends on how the smaller portion sizes pan out.|`|Ur9JAyd2aa	yes it will but in the morning have 1 glass luke water with fresh lemon juice with 7 glasses of plain water and then i glass of luke water at night  i do it and it does work good luck....|`|zhsTxqGxaa	It's good to always drink water.

At first, it is going to look as though you gained weight, but it is just water weight.  you will get rid of that in your urine, sweat, ext.  After a while your weight will start to go down because the water had been making you full faster and you didn't eat as much.  If you drink a lot of water, your weight will always var 3-4 pounds trough out the day, but the 3-4 pound range will start to go down.|`|sAegnwFMaa	. Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is important to your health, your normal diet and to help lose weight. Water is necessary for the metabolism of your stored fat. Weight loss cannot occur without an active metabolism which requires large quantities of water.<br>  Another way to use water to lose weight is to drink a large glass of ice water just before meals. The cold causes your stomach to shrink slightly which will make you feel full faster.|`|yKQKzKwMaa	Drinking more water will improve your health dramatically. However, the true key to shedding the pounds is "working off" more calories than you consume. This can be done in a very healthy and gradual way by eating everything you want, just less of it, like you're already doing. And hey, sometimes thirst is confused with hunger, so drink up! Stay healthy. :3|`|gDO4KWgjaa	Hello kathy I found the best way to lose weight fast was drink lots of water and some simple exercising. If you want a quick boost get some of that acai berry stuff at <a href="http://freeacai.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://freeacai.notlong.com</a>    that all the stars are using.

It's all about the total calories you eat and total calories you expend for the day.|`|IppPQJODaa	No it doesn't. What matters is that you DO exercise, when you can and feel like it. But if you are going to do some intense, make sure you let the dinner digest before doing it. (if you choose to exercise after dinner).

0ujpiBTCaa	If your diet is healthy, then no supplements are needed.<br>  <br>   If you cannot get all your nutrients from food, then look at what you are lacking and find a good multivitamin that doesn't have 500% of everything.|`|ljVwo5qZaa	You should probably talk to your Dr. about TRT. Testosterone Replacement Therapy. At your age your test is probably pretty low which which hinder your ability to gain muscle/lose fat.<br>  <br>  Other than that, a good multi, fish oil, joint support, and protein.|`|BCluX5xVaa	Well it is always a good idea to take a multivitamin especially if you are working out so much. You also might want to consider DHEA. It is a precursor hormone that has been touted as the "fountain of youth" vitamin. That certainly isn't true but as men age they start producing about 2% less DHEA a year from age 30 on. So you do the math at 55 your are producing half of what you were at 30. Now wonder why we have to work twice as hard for 1/2 the results. Check it out at Naturalhealthmarket.com|`|AA10607487	talk to your Dr
KUWDICSVaa	Weight fluctuates naturally. As a rule, only weigh yourself once a week. Try to do so at the same time of day and keep a journal. If you want to lose weight more rapidly, cut out dairy and keep doing your cardio routine! Also, you can take an Omega 3 supplement 45 minutes before every workout. The oil acts as a joint lubricant and makes for a more worthwhile exercise! A fab itunes library of upbeat songs is also best. Stay away from all the fads (acai berry, flushes, etc) they are just laxatives and diuretics! Best Wishes!
tIldpr7vaa	ur metabolism slows down alot when u dont eat, and if u dont eat u will lose fat and muscle. So its just a really crappy unhealthy way to do it.<br>  <br>  and when u start eating again most people put the weight back on|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Not being rude, but you know nothing about anything people have told you about anorexic people or peopel who starve themselves.<br>  <br>  Yes, you do lose weight not eating. It is water weight  though, and mostly muscle. Also, when you've gone more than a week or two without eating, your muscle is still being torn apart and used for energy, but your heart, lungs, liver, and other major organs are also being torn apart to be used for energy which is why coughing up blood happens a lot, and why most anorexics die before they even get "skinny"<br>  <br>  When you do eat again, all the food you eat is turned into fat. All of it. Your metabolism slows dramatically, so that you can store large amounts of fat in your body and no amount of exercise will take it off. So stop eating for a week, then eat again. You'll gain over double what you lost.|`|dUj7rP2haa	It's not that you don't loose weight if you don't eat.  Of course you will, but you might actually loose it faster if you eat a healthy diet.  And you will be loosing it in a way that isn't hurting your body.  Anorexics do a lot of damage to their body that can lead to long term health problems (if they live that long).  Being sick for a couple of days isn't a big deal.  People who fast for religious reason for a day or two a year aren't doing damage to themselves either.  But long term if you want to loose weight and keep it off, you need to train your body to burn calories and you do that but eating enough and moving.|`|ZbLa5lHdaa	obviously you lose weight if you don't eat.<br>  people just say that you don't because it's not exactly the healthiest way to lose weight but.. whatevr.

XQ3jHM9aaa	Everything feels traumatic when you are 14.  I too felt like you did about that time.  Not only are there hormonal changes going on in your body, but with me I felt like I didn't fit in at school, and my mom and I fought constantly.  I promise you it will get better.  This is just a phase in your life.  "this too shall pass."  I am so happy now that I didn't do anything stupid---like end my life.  I would have missed out on soooo much.  I have a really good life now, and what I went through back then seems so petty.  If you don't feel comfortable talking to your mom, try talking to someone like a guidance counselor at your school.  They could help you determine if you actually have depression and go from there.  I hope you start to feel better and God bless.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	so you don't want to tell the one person in your life that could actually get you the help you need?

I'm guessing your in the middle of the 8th grade and you are feeling all depressed in school in your relationships and than you are taking it all out on your family. Don't get too down on yourself, you will get through what ever you are going through. I felt the same way, at some points, in middle school. It's not worth it, just get through the days and find things that are fun and still make you happy. There are people that have way worse things happen to them than get yelled at by their fathers. A lot of people don't even have fathers, so be grateful that you have people looking out for you all the time. <br>  <br>  Hang in there. seriously.

WOW|`|09Y8F6hQaa	I'd say its time to switch things up!  Add an extra exercise day and count calories to make sure that you really are being honest with what you eat.  Its basically scientific, your body may fight the weight loss, but if you continue to eat low fat meals, in a high enough calorie range, that your body isn't going into starvation mode, and thus, lowering your metabolism, then you will start to lose weight again.  I remember last summer, as I was closer to my goal, I'd lose 1 lb a week, but I still made improvements in muscle tone, in my body.  You will do the same, and just in time for summer too.  One more thought, it feels weird having the sun on your tummy, after some time not wearing a bikini, but I'm sure you'll get used to it!   :)|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions|`|cAy1SI9vaa	You can use natural fat binder for losing the weight.|`|40f9996319d13867c4bbea47b436ef3aaa	That happened to me too!  I started cardio and I was able to continue loosing.  Slowly, because I was building muscle as well, but I was over the plateau.|`|IppPQJODaa	Weight training! You need to build some muscle and the fat will melt away. You won't bulk up, don't worry, but weight training is a key to fat loss.|`|LJZtSwUkaa	Here are a few tips to help you lose those last few pounds. They may sound obvious, but you'd be amazed how many dieters fail to take these elementary steps.<br>  <br>         Be Patient<br>  The key to losing those last stubborn pounds is to be patient! When you have very little weight to lose it is important to stick very closely to your diet in order get results. Think in terms of losing AT MOST 1-1.5 pound a week. This means following your diet and exercise program carefully for 7-10 weeks. If you do this, even the most stubborn final pounds of fat will disappear.<br>  <br>  Boost Your Daily Exercise<br>  If you take regular exercise, increase your workout by 10-15 minutes each day AND change your workout routine. Changing the type of exercise you do, or the duration, gives your metabolism an extra boost and helps to burn extra calories.<br>  <br>  Eat Regularly<br>  Eat little and often throughout the day. This helps to maintain your metabolic rate at maximum speed. Also, it keeps your blood-sugar level stable, which is helpful in reducing appetite build-up and food cravings. Some surveys show that eating "little and often" actually reduces appetite and calorie-intake.<br>  <br>  Think Thin!<br>  This may sound like psycho-babble, but it's not! Our beliefs really do affect how we behave. If you believe "I can never lose my final 10 pounds", chances are you won't. This is because we behave in a way that makes our belief a reality. However, if you think "Seven weeks from now my last 10 pounds are gonna be history" you will work to make that belief a reality.<br>  <br>                  Combine Aerobic and Anaerobic Exercise<br>  The ideal calorie-burning training program involves a combination of both these types of exercises. Ideally get advice from a fitness professional as to how to structure your program. As a rough guide, if doing a 60-minute workout at a fitness center or using a home gym, divide your program into approximately 40 minutes cardio and 20 minutes weight-training, or do aerobics one day and weights the next.
jUsv00Akaa	P90X is pretty cool - I've started it and have been on it for about 3 weeks, though I don't stick to it.  It definitely keeps you active.  I was not expecting some of the videos to be a full 90 minutes long, though, and sometimes I just don't have time to finish it.  Some of the moves on the yoga days I just can't do, but I'll hopefully get more flexible with time.  For dumbbells, I use Bowflex SelectTech Dumbbells because they save so much space.  And for the chinup bar, I'd definitely get the iron gym xtreme instead of p90x bar.  See the source below to see my full review as to why i used it.  Also, get the perfect pushup - it's a lot of help, too.

ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	human beings are omnivorous, not vegetarian.  There are many negative health effects from eating vegetarian, like anemia, and failure to metabolize certain nutrients because they lack the amino acids gotten only from meat.  So, I would have to say NO, it is UNHEALTHY to be vegetarian.|`|104c298c569130856f8ea29d45c48c6caa	Meat is small amounts is perfectly OK. Being mostly vegetarian is  the best way to stay healthy.|`|24vZfnF3aa	meat is a good & easily digestible source of many essential minerals, such as iron. Therefore, if you are thinking of becoming a vegetarian, you need to look at what you eat much more closely, to replace what might otherwise be missed in your diet. Fatty cuts of meat can lead to health problems, by raising your cholesterol levels, otherwise, there are no health problems eating meat. Becoming vegetarian, is generally considered as being more humane, not for health reasons. You can just as easily eat a bad vegetarian diet, as have an unhealthy diet which contains meat.|`|q5bcTa0waa	if ur eating fried greesy meat than its bad for you.  insted of batter fish eat it oven baked fish with olive oil. instead of burger eat steak, insted of pop corn chicken or fried chicken eat roast or baked or boiled cold chicken . there are more health problems if ur a vegeterian. we are not sheeps|`|UprHBszmaa	just look at the food pyramid. certain amounts of each group

yKQKzKwMaa	I have been on Paxil for over a year now for my panic disorder, and my dosage has been gradually increased to 60mg. I must say... I feel like I am myself again. I feel more rational and sure of myself. Being 18, I'm surely not the most mature person on the planet, but I've definitely felt a change. I hope you have the same, if not better, results!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Not to be your downfall but it most likely wont work. give it at least 3 months to see. Most need to switch up their cocktails a lot to find one that works. i never found mine however.|`|AA11551690	I'm sure there are success stories and I'm sure there are stories where Paxil didn't work for some.  I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety disorder several years ago.  I was put on a couple of different things at various dosages before the best one was found.  It does take time to test, however.  Unless there is a severe adverse reaction to the drug, it takes time to tell whether it will work or not.  Remember you're not only dealing with an imbalance of chemicals in your brain (many times the reason for depression) but you are now trying to reverse what seems to be a natural occurence to your body.  It takes time.  In the meantime, I found that finding other "tools" to help with my anxiety, etc. was very helpful.  Music, meditation, prayer and spending time in nature seem to be some of my most useful tools.  Good luck and God bless.|`|58c8c6e863d8975827bd15064ea547c2aa	Before you go and start yourself on meds.. Try and control your problem yourself..<br>  <br>  I have bipolarism and ADD, I used to be on meds for both of them, these meds would really mess with my head, and when I was on them, they made me a different person.. And I didn't like the fact that I couldn't be myself in society, I had to be somebody else, I had to be medicated. So one day I stopped taking the meds, and really focused my mind, and when I would get really irritated for nothing, I would say to myself.. "this isn't me mad, its the bipolarism thats mad" took a deep breath and exhaled the stress.. <br>  And for the ADD, I would always have trouble remembering things my short term memory was horrible, so instead of remembering things, I would make them instinctive, Instead of remembering to grab my keys every time I leave the house, I made it a reflex, I don't even think about it.<br>  <br>  The main point here.. medication is bad for you. Try to deal with your problem without the meds first. If all else fails, then you can take the meds, especially since its depression.. better to be medicated than suicidally depressed.|`|KPOaPZqJaa	Well i chose not to take anti-depressants and i turned out fine, im happy now without any meds, i once took them and they made me act like a dick to my friends and think i was better then everyone.<br>  <br>  Its all up to you though the battle with depression is a heck of a battle|`|HmV3nuL4aa	Sadly, I think the success rate of "curing" anxiety with prescription drugs is very low. <br>  <br>  You should look into a complete diet/exercise program.

It’s estimated that THC can have a half life that ranges anywhere from 1-10 days. It’s almost impossible to find out what that half life is, which means that it is very difficult to use it to calculate how long it will take for all of the THC to leave your body.<br>  <br>  For this reason, when you ask “How long does marijuana stay in your system?” you have to realize that it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to get a usable answer. The most common period of time is anywhere from 3-30 days, depending on your metabolism and the amount of marijuana that you’ve smoked. This is unfortunate, since it means that while most drug tests can only turn up evidence of other drugs if you’ve been taking the drug within a few days of the drug test, marijuana could still be detected in a urine test up to a month after the last time it is used. If you smoke it occasionally it will remain in your system for up to 10 days. If you smoke marijuana on a regular basis it will stay in your system for as long as 45 days, and if you smoke marijuana at a constant pace, it can stay in the body for 90 days, Marijuana is fat soluble. It stores in the fat cells of the body, the brain, the liver, the kidneys, in other words the major organs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sjwNNWBCaa	are you taking this urine test?<br>  if so, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Its usually out of your system within a couple of weeks<br>  depending what kind/ how much you smoked.<br>  Sometimes is may take a month but no longer than<br>  two months.<br>  <br>  Theres also some pills at wal mart you can take<br>  to help get rid of it.<br>  <br>  Its called Niacin.<br>  <br>  Basically, you just pee a lot more and get the<br>  toxins out of your body quickly.<br>  <br>  :)|`|RKUvBM9gaa	you will be completely fine. it's usually out of your system in about 42 days

In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine!

There are things you can't control about your<br>  metabolism, and no product ever will. On the other hand, there are<br>  simple natural techniques, which will allow you to do it.<br>  What you can’t control about your metabolism:<br>  Age: Metabolism slows about 5 percent for each decade after 40.<br>  That’s because as we get older, we tend to lose muscle and gain body<br>  fat. Lean muscle mass is more metabolically active than fat tissue. So<br>  when you lose muscle mass, your metabolism slows down.  <br>  Gender: Men generally have faster metabolisms than women because<br>  they’re larger and have less body fat. Men’s basal metabolic rate is<br>  estimated to be 10 percent to 15 percent higher than women’s.<br>  Hypothyroidism: An underactive thyroid will slow down your metabolism<br>  and ultimately lead to weight gain. The good news is that a simple<br>  blood test can determine whether you have this condition or not. If<br>  you do, you can control it with the proper medication.<br>  Genetics: Some people are lucky enough to be born with speedy<br>  metabolisms — and others are not.<br>  What you can control about your metabolism:  Diet<br>  <br>  Don’t eat fewer than 1,000 calories a day. Your body and metabolism<br>  thrive on food. When you fast or crash diet, your metabolism will slow<br>  down in order to conserve energy. Imagine your metabolism as a blazing<br>  fire. If the fire burns consistently with the appropriate amount of<br>  high-quality wood, it will burn at a steady rate. But if it doesn’t<br>  have enough wood, the fire goes out. If it has too much wood, it can<br>  get out control — just like your waistline! <br>  Eat every four to five hours. Our bodies work hard to digest and<br>  absorb the foods we eat,  and your metabolism revs up in response.<br>  This is called the thermic effect of food. Take full advantage of this<br>  and schedule meals and snacks every four to five hours.   <br>  Make breakfast a priority. Studies show that people who regularly eat<br>  a healthy breakfast within two hours of rising are more likely to<br>  control their weight. This may be because you’re lifting your<br>  metabolic rate after it’s been in a “resting phase” during the night.<br>  Eat protein with every meal: All foods create a thermic effect and<br>  will slightly boost your metabolism. However, eating protein gives<br>  your body a bigger metabolic boost than eating carbohydrates or fats.<br>  Plus, eating  enough protein will ensure you’ll maintain and build<br>  muscle mass. (Remember, the more muscle mass you have, the greater<br>  your metabolic rate). Make sure to incorporate lean protein into most<br>  every meal.<br>  Best protein sources: fish, chicken breast, turkey breast, lean red<br>  meat, skim milk, nonfat yogurt, eggs and egg substitutes, tofu, beans,<br>  and lentils. <br>  <br>  Meal Examples:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: yogurt with fresh fruit<br>  Lunch: turkey burger on whole-grain bun and a salad<br>  Dinner: grilled chicken with vegetables and a baked potato<br>  Exercise<br>  <br>  Do aerobic exercise four to five days a week. Aerobic activities,<br>  such as running, brisk walking, swimming and bike riding, burn<br>  calories and increase metabolism while you’re working out. Several<br>  studies show that aerobic activities cause your metabolism to stay at<br>  an elevated level for a period of time after you have finished<br>  exercising.<br>  Work in strength-training exercise two to three days a week. Lifting<br>  weights and other strengthening activities, such as doing push-ups or<br>  crunches, on a regular basis will actually boost your resting<br>  metabolism all day. That’s because these activities build muscle. And<br>  once again, muscle burns more calories than body fat. In fact, if you<br>  have more muscle, you burn more calories — even if you’re sitting<br>  still.<br>  When it comes to supplements, I do not recommend them. The<br>  ingredients that are effective tend to boost metabolism only slightly<br>  and they can be risky. High doses of stimulants can make you jittery,<br>  and increase heart rate and blood pressure. <br>  The bottom line: The safest and most effective way to boost your<br>  metabolism is to eat an appropriate amount of food every four to five<br>  hours, incorporate a portion of lean protein into each meal, and<br>  exercise regularly!|`|qeR967J7aa	Exercise, but mix up your cardio with weight training.

Exercises such as the bicycle, leg lifts, leg slides, squeezing a stability ball and leg raises help slim the thighs. <br>  <br>  Step2~Reduce the amounts of carbohydrates and fats in your diet. If you notice that your thighs store fat, then any excess fat from food and drink will go straight to your thighs. Drink more water, eat more fruits and vegetables, drink skim milk, low fat dressings and fat free cream cheese and other cream based products. <br>  <br>  Step3~Begin a walking routine. Walking helps slim down the body overall and won't bulk up your leg muscles like jogging will. <br>  <br>  Step4~Try cellulite creams that break down fat composition in the body and give your legs a slimmer appearance. New research suggests that creams which contain caffeine help slim thighs and improve the appearance of your legs. <br>  <br>  Step5~Spread on self tanner, giving your thighs an extra layer. Tanned skin automatically appears slimmer than pale skin, and self tanner helps give the illusion that your legs are slimmer than they really are.|`|TbWqaCZnaa	You've got to lower your overall bodyfat levels in order to slim down your butt and thighs. In terms of exercise, the best "lower-body toning" moves are squats and lunges. Keep the weight light and the reps high in order to avoid getting bulky butt and thigh muscles.
2uZivThaaa	They say there is no such thing as spot reduction but if you eat healthy and work out by running, lifting weights, lunges, and sit ups, your figure will stay nice a curvy! Focus on buttocks, thighs, and abs by doing work out designed for those areas. Go to your local gym and an employee will be able to show you the equipment that works those parts of your body! :}
I2Tw4zOAaa	It's natural to have one side stronger or bigger than the other.  For chest especially, the best thing to even it out is push ups.  Do full push ups touching your chin to the ground.  The key is also to keep your body evenly distributed over both arms, you can easily tell when one is doing more work because you'll feel it in you ankles when it isn't even.
LKqbrHNnaa	It's so normal I was surprised to read your question hun!<br>  <br>  Your vagina is an area that needs to be clean and balances - it cleans itself none stop and expels any unwanted cells in the form of white discharge. This is very healthy and a sign that everything is working properly so don't want it stop!<br>  <br>  Wearing pantyliners is good for now, and you can also buy fresh wipes for your genital area. <br>  <br>  When you have sex with your boyfriend, the white fluid you see isn't all discharge, it's natural lubrication from your vagina.|`|8j7FCEOraa	If your a woman, discharge is completely normal. There is not much you can do about it<br>  <br>  When you have sex, there is a little bit of discharge, a little bit of your vagina's natural lubricant, and when you orgasm even a little bit female ejaculation. All normal. If you want this to stop, then dont have sex.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	Yes it is normal especially if you are close to ovulation. Don't worry its normal.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	I have the same thing and I went to 2 different gynecologists and they told me it was normal. You should wipe yourself before you have sex. That's what I do so he can't see the discharge. I wish there was something to make it stop but I guess there isn't.|`|WBf2V8vSaa	It is normal, and the discharge is a way for your area to clean its self. :] Wait it out.|`|GIxctDDuaa	Well if your doctor says its normal. Then I guess there's nothing to do about it.|`|2v60zG5Faa	normal sadly just wear a panty liner or a pad every day n u dont reely need to change xxxxx|`|dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.  You *don't* want them to stop... trust me.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|Z7TzJWX4aa	this happens to every woman.  why do you hate your body?<br>  <br>  this is EXACTLY like you asking, "why do i have saliva in my mouth?  it is gross and i want it to go away."<br>  <br>  do you think semen is gross, too?<br>  <br>  weirdo.|`|JuaS4jbzaa	<a href="http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/women/reproductive/vaginal/194.html" rel="nofollow">http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/...</a><br>  <br>  Read this article.

Ue56xZ7vaa	Only yogurt and water is probably not the best idea, but it's much better than eating only lettuce or something crazy like that.<br>  most yogurt probably dosen't have enough fat, protein and other nutrients you need.<br>  and drinking alot of water is really good for you too.<br>  i think a good idea would be the yogurt for 2 meals, then a small dinner like a salad with grilled chicken or some type of meat. [if you eat meat] and veggies on it!<br>  <br>  and remember you NEED fat in your diet, it isn't full fat that keeps you from losing weight, it's carbs. you need fat to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  but living on only yogurt, water, and small dinner everyday like a salad, may cause you to end up binging in a week or two.|`|mYSrB7yeaa	Not necessarily a good idea, but a better idea than what your friend is doing.  Drinking only water is a good idea.  You're going to want to make sure, though, that you get all the nutrients that your body needs.  Also, be careful because if you just suddenly start stop eating a lot of food, your body might go into starvation mode and it will be harder to lose weight.|`|fOzSL7tIaa	Yeah.. Because its lowfat.. but your body also needs its nutritions too. So dont only eat yogurt plus you will get so tired of yogurt.. try fruits too. And why people is always fat is because of soft drinks.. Soft drinks have a supplement where it makes you even more thirsty than before therefor making you drink more than you need which puts on weight. Thats why you need to drink water.. Plus water makes you sweat and sweating helps loose weight. So exercise too!!!|`|cjlwOKR1aa	yes it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>  <br>  do it ,

7BHIyMFmaa	Interesting question. I would think that you would have to get a dermatologist to sign off on it. But at the same time your health care may take the view that you voluntarily got the tattoos, so it's on you if you want them removed. I think it's going to come down to getting a specialist to tell your health care company that your condition is life-threatning.|`|l2kQZQkwaa	Unfortuately, tattoo removal is strictly cosmetic and will not be covered by insurance.|`|45qyvYU2aa	Under most circumstances tattoo removal will not be covered by any health insurer.  I'm not sure that an allergy to the ink would fall under any exclusion to this rule since the procedure is considered cosmetic.

Bunions build up over time when shoes are rubbing or too tight and although some people get them fixed at the foot doctor (a little surgery) they can go away in time (months) with shoes that don't rub or touch the area, like sandals.  But because of the pain, you should go and see the doctor.|`|TR9lcgcjaa	go to the drug store and get some Compound W.<br>  It's for warts.

Vs36fEmbaa	Check out www.3treasure.com for further information.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	The practice of acupuncture is based on the understanding that a vital energy, referred to as "Qi" (pronounced, "chee"), flows along channels or meridians throughout our bodies. When this Qi becomes blocked or does not flow freely, it can cause disharmony or disease. In order to correct this disharmony, the Qi must be stimulated so that it moves freely again. The aim of Acupuncture, though, is to identify and treat the underlying cause(s) of the problem. This is called the "root" of the problem, and it is said that Acupuncture treats the root, rather than chasing the leaves (the symptoms).<br>  <br>  Used for:  Addiction Asthma.Carpal tunnel syndrome Fibromyalgia Headache Low back pain  Menstrual cramps Myofascial pain Nausea and vomiting Osteoarthritis Post-operative dental pain Stroke rehabilitation Acne Allergies Anxiety Arrythmias Arthritis Colds and flu Diabetes Digestive complaints Earaches Eczema Hemorrhoids High blood pressure Hot flashes Impotence Menstrual irregularities Morning sickness Neuralgias Sciatica.Sinus infections Sprains, strains|`|oXl8zVZmaa	It's elctro chemical stimulation that uses your own bodies chemicals to adjust the the basic 12  meridians which corresponds to your main organs of the body.<br>  The Yin and Yang ( Chinese Philosophy) of opposites, when they are not balanced either high or low, you become sick, they are then balanced with needles or minor electrical impulses and you become well.<br>  You have 12 pulses, 6 on each wrist which corresponds to your main organs, a good Practisioner that uses the pulse test will be able to tell you what is causing the problem and adjust the meridians.

AA12358000	Mouse's Alter Ego, Dani :)<br>  The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa remains unclear, it is also known as Verneuil's disease or acne inversa, Multiple treatment regimens are available, including antibiotics, retinoids, corticosteroids, incision and drainage, local wound care, local excision, radiation, and laser therapy. However, no single treatment has proved effective for all patients. Radical excision of the defective tissue is the most definitive treatment. There is no cure for hidradenitis suppurativa. Initial treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa can begin with conservative measures such as warm baths, hydrotherapy, and topical cleansing agents to reduce bacterial load. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may alleviate pain as well as inflammation. Antibiotics, although not proven to be effective, are the mainstay of medical treatment, especially for lesions suspected of being superinfected. The following are thought to play a role in the development of hidradenitis suppurativa - Genetics – frequently reported cases of hidradenitis suppurativa affecting multiple members of a family.  Sex hormones – apocrine sweat glands are stimulated by androgen and suppressed by oestrogen (the exact role these hormones play remains controversial).  Endocrine factors – obesity, hirsutism and acne are common findings among women with hidradenitis suppurativa. Cigarette smoking – hidradenitis suppurativa appears to occur more frequently in smokers than non-smokers.  Women are affected by hidradenitis suppurativa three times as often as men; the reason for this is unknown. The condition most commonly occurs between 20-40 years and coincides with the post-pubertal increase in androgen levels. Disease onset rarely occurs before puberty or after menopause. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

That has some efficacy in treating hidradenitis, but it is not a definitive cure.|`|AA10554783	Medical management of hidradenitis suppurativa is difficult. The aim is to catch the disease in its early stages and treat and control these milder forms. Weight loss in obese patients and smoking cessation are recommended. <br>  <br>  General measures include:<br>  Wash with antiseptics or acne preparations to reduce skin carriage of commensal bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide solution and medical grade honey have been found helpful. <br>  Wear loose fitting clothing to avoid friction. <br>  Follow a low glycaemic diet, and aim for ideal body weight. <br>  Don't smoke. <br>  Medical management includes: <br>  Topical anti-acne antibiotics such as clindamycin or erythromycin applied to affected areas in combination with benzoyl peroxide. <br>  Short course of oral antibiotics for acute abscesses (red, hot painful discharging lump) due to staphylococcal infection. Flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin are the most suitable, except in the case of penicillin allergy. <br>  Prolonged courses of tetracycline or metronidazole (minimum 3 months) for their anti-inflammatory action. <br>  Three-month courses of the combination of clindamycin and rifampicin may be effective. <br>  Trial of oral contraceptive pill for 12 months or more – usually Diane-35 or Estelle 35, which contain moderate oestrogen and cyproterone acetate. The antiandrogenic diuretic spironolactone may also be of benefit. <br>  Oral retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) for 6 to 12 months, especially isotretinoin, which are very effective for acne, may also help hidradenitis suppurativa. <br>  Systemic corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroids (injections directly into the nodules) may reduce severe inflammatory lesions. <br>  In severe cases, the use of biological response mediators such as infliximab and other TNFα antagonists, may be worth considering. <br>  Surgical management includes: <br>  Incision and drainage of abscesses – at the very painful pointing stage. <br>  Persistent hidradenitis lumps may be excised after several months of conservative treatment (i.e. waiting and/or antibiotics). <br>  Radical excisional surgery is reserved for very severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa. <br>  Experimentally, laser ablation may be useful in some patients. <br>  Carbon dioxide laser treatment is a relatively new treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa. It is suitable for those with mild to moderate/severe disease and doesn’t require hospitalisation.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Dani, Have you ever looked up the disorder on Yahoo! Health or WebMD?

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women.

uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) with dinner, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.<br>   <br>  The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.<br>   <br>  A lot depends on when you take the Wellbutrin.  The doctors told me if I take it anytime after noon, I'll have trouble sleeping at night.  Taking it first thing in the morning seems to work okay.<br>   <br>  I would guess that not sleeping well at night is what's making you sleepy during the day. <br>   <br>  Only taking it four days, I'd give it another week or so, to give your system a little time to get acclimated to the Wellbutrin.|`|JimRH1oRaa	ask a doctor|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	I doubt most of those things have anything to do with your medication.

hvUnMwMWaa	According to The American Social Health Association, under a microscope HSV 1 and HSV 2 are virtually identical, sharing approximately 50% of their DNA. Both types infect the mucosal surfaces of the body – most often the mouth or the genitals and then establish latency in the nervous system. For both types, it is estimated that two thirds of those infected have no noticeable symptoms or no symptoms at all. Studies have show that both viruses can be spread when there are no symptoms present.<br>  Though society believes type 1 to be the “Good Virus”, researchers are finding HSV-1 to be more “risky” than previously perceived. Some medical professionals are finding type 1 to be a more “significant” infection than HSV 2 in the neonate and the prevalence of HSV 1 is severely underestimated. For years it was believed that 90% of people had HSV 1. We know now it is 60%. Even at sixty percent having type 1 orally and the unknown figures of HSV 1 genital cases gives indication that herpes is not a virus to be ignored.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	80% of the adult population has HSV-1.

kdSuwt8paa	Right - you are not huge so all you need is a healthy programme.<br>  If you tone up you won't necessarily lose weight because you will be replacing fat with muscle.   First of alll your menu.     <br>  This is absolutely the simplest and really works.<br>  Breakfast - a portion of cereal with either a tub of light yoghurt or a banana.  Glass of milk.<br>  Mid morning. Piece of fruit.<br>  Lunch. Either tuna or cold meat and salad sandwich. (Or salad in a container if you prefer that.)<br>  Mid afternoon. Piece of fruit. Dry crackers.  Glass of milk.<br>  Evening meal, whatever the family is having but no rich sauces. No dessert.<br>  No cheese, chocolate, sodas or junk food.<br>  20 minute walk every day - trying to go a bit further (faster) each day.<br>   A good glass of water with each meal or snack. Eating like this (normally) is much better than a diet because you can keep it up indefinitely and it won't bug your mum! You will notice a difference quite quickly.<br>  You also need to have a 20 minute brisk walk every day.    (If you play sport that can be instead of a walk on the days you play.)|`|dUj7rP2haa	There are people who are paid by the company who makes acia berry pills to come one here.

QsVMeaPXaa	suggest AA or any addiction support group. You can't fix him you can only support him when he does work hard at giving up drinking. Life is hard for many of us, and we don't drink. If you go along with his way of thinking that because life is or has been rough, he can resort to drinking. NO!!! He needs therapy for his childhood and AA support for his alcoholism and if you are going to stay in the picture, you need to start going to Al-Anon.<br>  Are you sure it isn't that he is rich? Don't be swayed by something like that and don't get into a situation where you end up getting abused.|`|P5VpQnNOaa	im sorry, i feel ur pain. all u can do is be there for him, and be there when he needs u. im sorry for wat ur friend has suffered. men can be mean and nasty creatures, from time to time. and i hope that u wont start drinking. good luck with ur freind. ive lost a few to drugs and alcohol. sorry

The physical method is when the male, or female is surgically altered in order to block or throw off the reproductive track. In the male this process is called a vasectomy, this is where the doctor will cut open the scrotum of the male, and surgically cut, or block the tube which carries the sperm to the penis. In the female the process is commonly called "tying the tubes", which is basically the same thing just in a female. Another type of birth control that is very popular nowadays in the younger population is the barrier method. This is the type in which a male, or a female uses something to block the sperm from entering the vulva.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|fjvgaNydaa	Planned Parenthood.

BoN7SPlKaa	What you need to think about when losing weight is diet. all those exercises are great but unless followed up with a good healthy diet it will take twice as long. also the best way to optimize weight loss from those exercises would be to do the leg lifts, donkey kicks, squats and crunches before your jog. the reason for this is that while you are doing exercise it uses up your aerobic and anaerobic capacity (short term energy reserves) and then when your are running you are burning fat.<br>  <br>  i no that makes me sound pretty smart, but keep in mind i am only a 16yo PE student that goes to the gym a bit. thats about it experience wise. but i went from flabby to full on six pack in about 13weeks using the runs after workout technique and it really does work!|`|iLDL3zMXaa	That exercise is great, you will surely lose weight if you keep that up.<br>  <br>  But you have to eat healthy also, exercise is just one aspect if your trying to lose weight.

16c2CbFraa	This is not good but fortunatley you are seeking help and seeing a counsellor. From my personal experience the contraceptive pill is a demon for moods and depressive tendancies. I think it plays a big part in hormone control and can leave you feeling emotionally drained at times. I can guarantee when you start to see your counsellor you will talk about a lot of issues you didnt even know you had and you will also learn how to address these issues purely through mind control. As for your boyfriend just have a think what it must feel like to be on the end of your moods (I am not being cheeky to you in any way I am just pointing out how he must feel). When you look at it through his eyes (being a guy) he probably doesnt understand the situation fully and just sees you as being stroppy etc when really there is more to the story. There are actually useful sites for your boyfriend usually from a mans perspective when their partner has depression. You should look them up and let him read them and he will probably feel much better.<br>  I wish you well and I know that when you start seeing that counsellor you will proabably start feeling great and realise that through mind control you can stop the sadness.|`|ZDdUSL2Naa	Maybe you should just sit your boyfriend down and tell him that you are depressed and that you really need his support. Tell him that you dont mean to take it out on him, its just that we hurt the people we are closest to. Ask him to be patient with you and be there for you. If he really does like you then he sould understand. Communication is the key otherwise you will probably end up losing him. I hope you feel better soon and work things out with your boyfriend! :)|`|yUyq8nsxaa	wow... i thought i was reading about myself! I′m in a situation just like yours... anyways... it could definitely be the pill... if the depression and mood swings started soon after u started the pill then that′s most likely the problem... it′s good u stopped taking them... I had a terrible reaction to the pill i was on, i stopped taking them about a month ago, but i still have violent mood swings... it can take a while for it to get out of your system... but for now, just take things slow and be aware of your thoughts and feelings... you can control them... that′s what i′m working on right now, and it′s really helping! you always have to  be aware of your thoughts and make sure they are positive... and stay positive!! attitude is everything... if u maintain a good attitude and know that you′re gunna get better, you will! good luck :)|`|WX1g8lcxaa	OK, your a teenager. I can tell that. You obviously have a caring mother, which means you'll have a roof over your head and food on the table. You also have a caring boyfriend who sticks with you even though your flying off the handle. SO what the hell are you depressed about? Self harming is not a symptom of depression, it's an attention-seeking mechanism. If you were REALLY depressed you wouldn't want anyone to know so you wouldn't self-harm and you wouldn't come braodcasting it on the internet asking for help. I don't like to make generalisations but I'm guessing your a kind of emo teenager. An attention seeking teenager. Realise that you're not alone, your exactly like every emo teenager out there. So snap out of it, be thankful for what you actually have in life and just bloody smile for once.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so blunt and direct, but I think it's what the youth need today.
rqxpZlzpaa	Treatment And Prevention Of Migraine Headaches Homeopathic remedies have proven to be very successful in the treatment of migraines as they can reduce both the pain and the sickness, especially if taken in the early stages. Not only can homeopathic remedies be used at the time of a migraine, but treatment from a qualified homeopath can also reduce the likelihood of migraines recurring in the future.<br>   <br>   A tendency towards migraines often runs in the family and allergic factors may be involved. However, the most significant trigger of migraines is stress. Serotonin levels are higher in migraine sufferers - serotonin is released when adrenaline levels rise due to stress. These are issues that a homeopath would consider routinely when determining the best way to treat a client with migraine.<br>   <br>   <br>   Here's a testimonial from a previous migraine sufferer: "I had been suffering with pressure headaches since contracting glandular fever last year. Things weren't resolving with traditional medical intervention and on the recommendation of my wife's friend I started homeopathy consultations. Within the space of a few homeopathic treatments my headaches have resolved and I feel back to my normal, healthy self again."<br>   <br>   Lifestyle adjustments<br>   <br>   If you suffer from migraines, it is recommended that you to eat regularly, get eight hours sleep per night and avoid adrenal stimulants such as tea, coffee, orange juice and chocolate.<br>   <br>    Selecting the best remedy<br>   <br>   For relief during a migraine, you can try one of the following four main homeopathic migraine remedies, which are available in leading pharmacies and health food stores. Simply choose the remedy which most closely matches your symptoms:<br>   <br>   - Natrum Muriaticum - The migraines / headaches are often worse in the morning and you may wake up with a headache / migraine or with a warning that you will get one. There is often severe pain in the head as if it would burst. This pain may make you cough or make your eyes water. This is one of the most common migraine / headache homeopathic remedies.<br>   <br>   - Nux Vomica - Severe headache / migraine with chilliness and vomiting, resulting from over-work or stress. You may feel relief from leaning your head against something (i.e. pressure on the forehead) and you may be more sensitive to noises than normal during the headache / migraine. Being constipated increases the chance that you will suffer a migraine.<br>   <br>   - Bryonia - You will have very severe headaches with additional pain over the eyes in some cases. Even simple movements like moving your eyes from one side to the next can worsen your pain. In this case it's often a good idea to close your eyes. The headaches / migraines often come on after drinking alcohol or from a lot of stress.<br>   <br>   - Arsenicum Album - Often the migraines / headaches are relieved in some way from cold applications on the head. If you require this remedy there will often also be digestive disturbances, e.g. vomiting or diarrhea. You may be feeling anxious and / or chilly at the same time.<br>   <br>   You can purchase the remedy in a 30c potency and take one pill every two hours while your symptoms continue, up to six doses per day. Stop taking the remedy as you start to feel relief and only repeat the remedy if your symptoms return.<br>   <br>   If your symptoms persist, always seek professional advice from your Homeopath or GP Never stop taking medication prescribed by your GP without his or her approval.<br>   By: Joy Healey<br>   Article Directory: <a href="http://www.articledashboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com</a><br>   What causes migraines?<br>   How does migraine pain compare to other kinds of pain??<br>   Dr. discusses migraine headache relief and why its critical to treat at the first onset of symptoms.<br>   <br>  <br>                                                                Migraine relief for sufferers                                                         <br>                                                            The people who suffer from migraine pains will only understand what it is.

You know that you shouldstop and that you're gonna be scarred for the rest of your life. Also, for me, cutting is a way out for me to direct my emotions when I'm so angry or depressed that I'm  considering suicide. When i feel suicidal urges threatening to overwhelm me, i feel that i must distract myself with physical pain. Hence the cutting. However, I'm trying to stop and am 6weeks without cutting =)|`|qIyO5jJcaa	I'm not a cutter, and I never plan to be, but the subconscious philosophy behind cutting is that unknowingly you know that endorphins are released throughout the body when pain is obtained. For example, you scrape your elbow and it hurts, but after 5 minutes after doing nothing, wouldn't it feel better? Endorphins can soothe mental and physical pain, so it's basically like taking a shot of heroine without getting high.|`|lSa6lV7Maa	hell<br>  inescapable hell<br>  at first its a release that temporally solves everything.<br>  Then you get addicted without realizing. by the time you release youre addicted you cant stop.<br>  I had been cutting for 2yrs but i havent cut in almost a year. i wouldnt say ive recovered i still get the urge to do it just as strong as when i was doing it every day. I dont think you can ever really escape once youre addicted.|`|tL6sSR6Waa	In some ways it totally sucks, as the others have well pointed out. But, it does give something to the cutter, otherwise they wouldn't do it. For me it gives me a rush, a release, both on a chemical level (with the endorphines) and an emotional/psyhological level (punishing myself, venting anger I have towards others, "proving" I'm depressed). It does suck, and you become addicted in a sense, and you get awful scars and it limits your life and you constantly think about it and worry about it, and sometimes it can get to the point where it is physically deabilitating or life-threatening (though I've never gotten there before). But, I personally don't think "cutters" would be fine if they never started. They started for a reason, I started for a reason. They would have found another outlet, likely also destructive. And I would have found cutting one way or another, whether I had cut the first time I did or not.  Point is, it is really awful, and as they've said it's hell, and can cause so many problems. But, I'm more empathetic than judging of cutters (obviously). Why are you asking about this? Do you know someone that cuts? Do you? If you want further info you should check out some sites, like recoveryourlife.com. that has a lot of 1st person info on cutting, and links for friends and family of cutters.|`|kwGsfXhHaa	it suck if ur thinking about cutting dont|`|pwwSp0Rtaa	It sucks.

Also it has been proven that if you have a predisposition to schizophrenia psychedelics can trigger it to come to the surface so to speak. As for what psychedelics you think are legal I don't know what those are. But Shrooms are a really euphoric trip, acid is way more intense and has a way of giving you a mind F**K even on a single hit and on the come down you get really bad aches. It all comes down to making sure you are physically and mentally ready to see things that don't look to be normal but look so real that your not sure whats real and whats not. And make sure you don't trip alone and you trip in a place you know well and feel safe at.

Do this as gently as necessary, but honestly, so you can start to work through the emotional holding involved. Awareness is the first step and it's not a quick process. <br>  <br>  What are you holding onto and are as obsessive about that is just as strong as her holding? It's only a reflection. What is the conflict really about, what is exactly the same that you don't see? This takes a bit of personal work. Change yourself and the result will be either she changes to match you or the relationship will end.<br>  <br>  <br>  If she refuses to change, there will come a time when you realise that you have done your best, but you can't make her decisions for her, you can only make your own.

ovrPxkRMaa	Oh my gosh, you are the only other person I have ever heard of that has fainted- Yay I'm not alone! I went to the doctors because I thought maybe I developed an allergy, but they saw nothing. I realized I fainted when I smoked certain weed- mainly regs. <br>  So first off let me do the responsible thing and say, smoking really isn't the best thing for you to be doing. After the last time I fainted (3years ago) I haven't smoked- that was the worse fainting spell I had.<br>  But I'm going to figure you are going to do what you want to do so I'll give you some tips that I realized help prevent some fainting spells for me. <br>  Make sure it's not crappy weed or laced with anything. Make sure you have eating through the day. And lastly, try not to smoke blunts (tobacco leaf) if you are not a tobacco smoker the tobacco mixed with the weed can have an effect.<br>  Hope I helped and have fun in Amsterdam!|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Only time I've come across that is when somebody cut the weed with something a bit more powerful.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I haven't personally, but it IS possible you inhaled so much herb smoke that it temporarily blacked you out...<br>  <br>  I would think that might occur if you hadn't eaten in a while, or had just done some strenuous exercise before you smoked, you know...<br>  <br>  Just don't take such big hits...it sounds like you took a huge one...|`|mrysAOpGaa	yes, i have, i actually blacked out, they couldnt wake me up and all that fun suff, and i used to beable to smoke out a guy...after that happened, it was my last time smoking weed..|`|IMvg8zajaa	If you smoke a shitload, yea, you can pass out|`|qxteTM9Kaa	No,maybe it was laced with something else or you have a medical condition|`|saJoelMwaa	ive heard of ppl not being able to move but not passing out haha<br>  im sure ur be fine =) <br>  ur so luckyy..

The time to think about these things is before they happen.If this happened you need to go to a clinic or somewhere and get tested for everything from herpes to AIDS to hepatitis B&C. Only when the results come back will you know for sure, but in the meantime you really need to get that sore looked at. You may or may not have an infection of some sort.You may also have lucked out this time and bit yourself by mistake on the day in question.

xvey8ixPaa	Well, there are several factors at work here that you need to take into consideration. Just so you know, I had glasses I hated as a teen, and I have teens in glasses that do wear contacts. First, you should always make sure that you can see well and function well with your glasses. Remember this, if you do not show responsability with your glasse, you most likely will not show responsability with your contacts. So, wear your glasses, be good about it and act mature and deal with it. If you can not do this, you might not be seen to be mature enough for contacts. Secondly, it should never be and "either contacts or glasses"  thing. You can not wear contacts 24/7 and you can get sick or have an injury or have pink eye and not be able to wear your contacts, so you would need to wear your glasses. If you are not able to see well out of your glasses, the doctor needs to know. Another thing is, you parents will have to come up with extra money to have your eyes fit with contacts and to pay for your contact lens supply, it is an extra charge for both and most insurances do not even begin to pay for any of it. The quickest path to contacts, in my opinion would be to do these things:<br>  #1 Wear your glasses, and be mature about it.Wear them to school as well. Do not gripe, just do it.<br>  #2 Take good care of your glasses.<br>  #3 Do some research and find out how much it will cost to get the Contact lens part of the exam and what contacts start at. Call the Dr. Office. Write it all down. Come up with a plan to pay for half and present that to your folks.  This will let them know you are adult enough to come up with a financial plan, and that you are mature enough for this kind of endeavor.<br>  #4 Make sure you are taking acre of your existing health and cleanliness stuff you have right now. take showers and brush your teeth without being told, keep your room clean and make sure you clean up after yourself. A big part of contact lens are is cleanliness and the ability to take care of them right. If you can not take care of what you already have, you might not be good at the contact lens hygeine either. So, this is a serious thing for your health.<br>  #5 Just mind you folks and do what you are told. It is a hard thing to have glasses for the first time, but to get to the contacts they want you to do something reasonable that you are refusing to do. This is not a good way to get your contacts. Showing you are reasonable about your healthcare, and reasonable about your ability to be mature are the best ways to get there. Trust me. Good luck, and do try to do what your folks want you to do!

Those three diagnoses are Autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).

They are generally a begin variation of normal and do not represent pathology.Your Doctor will do blood work and a 24 hour ECG trace to see if there is another underlying cause.<br>  <br>  Palpitations are simply an awareness of ones own heart beating. . Anxiety and caffeine will cause you to have more palpitations. If you are having panicky problems on a regular basis then see if your GP will refer you for CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy).

There are long waiting lists for CBT so in the meantime your Doctor may prescribe you with an SSRI. <br>  <br>  As I said above, most of the time palpitations are normal, only occasionally do they represent pathology.

It is diagnosed by clinical features such as a typical facies, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin and by low levels of thyroid hormones. Management includes treatment of the cause and administration of thyroxine.<br>  Levothyroxine, a thyroid hormone, is used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. Without this hormone, the body cannot function properly, resulting in poor growth, slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry thick skin, and increased sensitivity to cold. When taken correctly, levothyroxine reverses these symptoms. Levothyroxine is also used to treat congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism) and goiter (enlarged thyroid gland).<br>  The side effects of Levthyroxine include:-<br>      * chest pain (angina)<br>      * rapid or irregular heartbeat or pulse<br>  If you experience either of the above symptoms, call your doctor immediately.|`|24vZfnF3aa	IT's normal for your heart to beat faster when you exercise, it also happens when you are stressed or anxious. The more you worry about your heart racing, the more aware you will be of it. Palpitations are only an increased awareness, & not a problem if the heart beat /rate & rhythm are normal. To feel an odd missed beat,is also common & nothing to worry about, it occurs more when you are stressed. it may also be that your body is not yet accustomed to your dose of thyroxine, or it needs adjusting. It's not long before your doctors appointment, so unless you develop any other symptoms, try not to worry.

First you should try talking to her, tell her what he does and how it makes you feel. If she refuses to do anything, then maybe you should live with your dad.<br>  <br>  Now....as for the cutting.

xzwZ3lt3aa	My son was in a head-on car accident too. He broke his femur really bad. He ended up having 6 surgeries. Finally after 3 years it healed. He is doing pretty good now. It's been about 4 1/2 years . He can't run, and sometimes it aches. His leg is definitely weaker from all the surgeries, so no more snowboarding, or sports.<br>  Unfortunately with you an ankle break can, and will cause arthritis, because it's in a joint. The leg will probably recover well. The Dr is giving you the worst case scenario. The swelling, and discoloration will go away eventually. As will your fear of driving. Luckily for my son he remembers nothing of the accident. I however was nervous driving for awhile.<br>  <br>  Checkout this website.

Tell her to have a one day liquid diet at an alternate day, not all at one time, her health will deteriorate at day 2. Tell her to do it for the whole day if she wants but tell her to have dinner!!

I exercise and that works for me, although I am trying to muscle up some more.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am 5ft 3 and I weight 99 lbs, yes very light i know, I have been skinny my whole life, so I wouldn't know how to lode weight but i do know how to maintain a healthy weight, I also exercise 5 to 6 times a week, I am trying to build muscle currently, I already eat healthy, I will never again eat a hamburger let me tell you that straigght out,<br>  <br>  Also if you want to loose weight and tone your body, you must do some light weight training, I would recommend the treadmill at 7%incline for 20 minutes at a time, then some light weight training 5 pounds in each hand up down up and down. Also drink lots of water. Also try to avoid greasy fat food, substitute your diet with more salads and thigns with lots of nutrients, when you have eggs, take out the yellow part, that has the cholesterol, and maybe try soyjoy, eat those instead of chips or something, itschaep, healthy and it gives great energy, For me it works really goos, i eat it before I go to the gym and its great.<br>  <br>  So I am not a doctor but that's what I reccomend!|`|w7IP7cLDaa	it worked for me,<br>  i weighed 130 pounds and in three months i am now 115!<br>  it works.<br>  the only thing she has to watch for is giving in.<br>  as soon as she breaks her fast and scarves down a whole turkey or chocolate ice cream..shes in for a real surprise. she will get very very hungery over time and give in. be careful if thats what shes gonna do. <br>  she will have to slowly come out of it.<br>  otherwise her body will immediatly react to the foods. say if she didnt eat for two days and then all of a sudden eats a choclate her body will go 'oooohh foooood!' and because her body is not used to having any food , the body will hold on to it because it does not know when the next time it will get food again....and we all know what happens when your body holds onto chocolate. and bad foods ,,,,that is how you gain weight..most of the time.

I asked a question similar, and people though I was lieing, but found the average for a grown man is around your size. Im a virgin, so I havent used mine at all, but the women's vagina is only 4 inches deep, so really if your good 4 inches could sastify. Hope this helped!|`|bS4FVYVRaa	If thats a erect mesurment then your fine, i have herd the average is 5 - 6 inchs so ur over that.<br>  <br>  If thats a "floppy" measurment then think about a job in porno :)|`|SltEwVX7aa	I wouldn't count on it;  well, it'll probably grow just a little more both in length and girth.

aQ8o4w3Xaa	It's not really because you're breaking the hymen. That can easily be done before you first have sex and you won't notice much. The reason it hurts is because you're being stretched out.<br>  <br>  It's like blowing up a balloon. When you first try to blow it doesn't quite work and it can take a few times before it easily stretches to the right shape. Then, after a few puffs, it easily blows out into shape and becomes normal. Think of it like that. It will take a few times until your vagina has stretched and opened enough so that it isn't put under pressure. <br>  <br>  When you first have sex, be relaxed and don't think too much. That will only make you tenser, which will make it hurt more. Invest in some lube, such as KY jelly. That will really ease the process and make it better for both people. Make sure adequate foreplay has taken place first. It will prepare you and make it easier. If you jump straight in, it will hurt you far more.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|6qsocyK3aa	No, because pain is often caused by you being nervous and subconsciously tensing your muscles. Just make sure you're nice and relaxed and completely comfortable with whoever he is when it does happen.|`|AA11987492	No, most of the discomfort that comes from having sex for the first time is just the friction that your vagina is not used to.

AA10820062	When I was 16 I started to have some really bad nightmares and I mentioned this to my biological dad. He introduced me to something called 'Lucid dreaming'. It allows you to enter a state while dreaming of total control. The exercise is simple, just look down at your hands 20 to 30 times a day (of course when no one is looking) and ask yourself "Is this real?". Ask the question to yourself and think of your nightmare or more exactly the emotion you felt while in the nightmare. It's as simple as that, it'll get to a point after a few days where you'll question yourself in your dreams and have full control. Lucid dreaming can be fun.

pvYy6iTSaa	Charlie,<br>  Poor living conditions means several lacking safety measures.  Decreased availability of soap and water washing of hands helps spread passage of bacteria and parasites on the hands, often from anal to hand to hand to mouth of another.  Lack of a safe water supply causes many water-borne diseass such as cholera and typhoid.  Crowded living space means closer physical contact, such as from coughing, which spreads colds and tuberculosis.  Mice and rats enjoy garbage areas and spreading bacteria like those which cause plague.  The list is almost endless.

Truthfully, there isn't much they can do for it.....virus doesn't respond to antibiotics.  <br>  <br>  You can treat the nasty symptoms by having your mother or father give you some ibuprofen or tylenol ( no aspirin).

She wants to be there for you when you start your period.|`|2QtnKQ5kaa	Getting your period is a huge event for most girls.  Your Mom will need to know so she can buy you the neccessary supplies and answer any questions you may have.  No, you don't have to take pills, unless you have severe cramps, then you can take an over-the-counter pain medicine, like tylenol or something.  She will have to give you pads, and you will have to deal with the cramps and the bleeding, and other bodily things that may or may not happen (for instance, some women are more gassy during their periods).<br>  <br>  Its important that your Mom know.  If you don't think you can go up to her and say "mom I have my period" then write her a note.|`|X3QbcIUwaa	Hmm not sure.<br>  <br>  My mum had prepared me about periods.<br>  <br>  I still remember that when I got it I shouted out happy 'mum I got it!<br>  <br>  We were jumping up and down at the bathroom and we had a period party.<br>  <br>  She always made me feel happy and proud to be a woman and it came natural to celebrate a moment like this with her.<br>  <br>  Maybe your mum wants to be part of that big moment in your life.<br>  <br>  After all, it is when you enter womanhood.<br>  <br>  Tell her, she may throw you a period party.<br>  <br>  I still remember mine:we had tea and cakes and she told me girly stories and recapped on everything I should know.|`|FWWegktKaa	She probably wants to be prepared with the pads/tampons so that you don't have to go out an buy them yourself.

sZ2LVd0faa	Alexithymia, i'm like you I had a look at this trying to find out why I am so numb. I laugh at teachers too but I know it's more than I should and I laugh when I don't want to instead of crying . I can't cry. Hope this helps|`|4GYCaoP6aa	I don't think it has anything at all to do with porn. :)  <br>  I used to think I was an insensitive person, because I didn't cry or feel affected by sad things. I started to become worried that maybe I really should care more. But later on I realized that I really do have compassion and I do deeply care for others, I just don't always react to things the way most people do.<br>  <br>  But if you really feel like something is wrong, and that you are truly desensitized, you may be experiencing depersonalization. It's a hard feeling to describe, but it's a lot like living in the dream world, where nothing really matters, and nothing is real at all. I've experienced this, and I know it's frustrating as hell. If you think that's what you're experiencing, you should definitely try talking to a doctor or counselor about it.  They can help.|`|k5hUdJmtaa	Hi, Emotionless.  Let me see if I understand your problem.  Your consciousness--that is to say, your sense of your own mind--feels empty, devoid of feeling, and devoid of emotional reaction.  You're confused about how your mother can so easily be (visibly) affected by sad news: She sees the sad news, and then shows signs of feeling sad (tearing up and saying how sad it is).  You're also confused, or maybe puzzled, about why your reaction to teachers' anger is amusement.<br>  <br>  You're concerned about this.  You think maybe you've watched so much porn, and I'm guessing here, that you may need stimulation that's as intense as porn for you to feel an emotional reaction.<br>  <br>  I think this is a great question, and I think you're pretty damned brave to ask it in the first place.  It's courageous to take a concern about your own inner self and ask some millions or billions of other people about it.<br>  <br>  There could be zillions of reasons you feel "emptiness"--from taking too much mood stabilizer to having borderline personality disorder to having grown up in an environment where the expression of emotion was strongly discouraged or even punished.  <br>  <br>  I'd bet, though, that in your case it's a transitory state--a "phase."  It sounds like you're a guy in your late teens.  The late teens are a time--especially for men--during which a lot of "identity" or "ego definition" issues are tackled and resolved.  <br>  <br>  Emotionless, you may be asking yourself, "Which Emotionless am I?  Am I the guy that watches TV with my crying Mum?  Am I the guy that can't wipe the smile off his face in class?  Am I the guy that gets off on some kinds of porn?  Or other kinds of porn?  Or am I the guy that is 'me' in my dreams?"<br>  <br>  And you may or may not be aware that you are asking yourself all these questions.<br>  <br>  I think you're carrying around WAY too much "should."  Here's what I mean:<br>  <br>  1.  I should be feeling stuff all the time; feeling empty is wrong.<br>  2.  It's cold and insensitive of me not to tear up when watching a sad news story--I should be able to react the way my Mom does.<br>  3.  I should be able to react more appropriately.  When teachers get angry, I should react in X way.<br>  4.  I shouldn't watch porn, or I should cut down on my porn watching.<br>  <br>  Now for the hat trick: Do you not notice all the emotion in your question?  You're confused.  You're worried.  You feel goofy (when your teachers get angry).  Maybe you feel inadequate (because you don't react the way you 'should' on seeing a sad news story).<br>  <br>  If there's any way to monitor yourself less, then do it.  Or check in with a friend--while you're hanging out, say, "Can I ask you a question?  Would you be able, if asked, to say how you felt right now?  'Cause I couldn't."  Or, when watching porn, when you are turned on, notice *how* you're turned on (we aren't always turned on in the same way).  Keep a journal.  And, since I am a teacher, don't ever, EVER "wipe that smile off your face."  It's part of growing up to resist your teachers, and if my own students didn't resist me, I know I would not be doing my job.|`|7kga2aRBaa	haha that sucks but at least you probably dont get hurt easily.  A lot of people do laugh when teachers get angry cause its just funny! haha. <br>  <br>  <br>  anyway, you think porn has stolen your emotions?

But if not, you should definitely see a doctor about it. It could be your thyroid, but it could also be PCOS, or any number of things.<br>  <br>  I've actually been going through the same thing as you.. I only had one natural period last year, which sucked. Never thought I would be complaining about a lack of pms, lol. Oh, by the way I'm 23. And I was on the pill when my periods stopped, but went off after missing two cycles.<br>  <br>  I have been taking prometrium (progesterone pills - supposed to kick start your cycle) and clomid pretty regularly, and I do get periods from that now. Without all the medication though, I honestly have no idea where I'd be at...<br>  <br>  According to my doctor (the most highly recommended gynecologist in the city), it's not really anything to worry about TOO much.. unless you're trying to start a family, in which case you'd probably be in the same boat as me.

It is little fluid filled sacs on your ovaries that won't let the eggs release. I really don't have any periods unless I use medication to start it. You also could be under a lot of stress and that will throw you off. I would go to a clinic to have a blood pregnancy test to make sure. You need to go see your Gyn and if you don't have one, you'll need to find one. Have you been diagnosed with anything wrong with your thyroid? If not go get it checked.

If you do it properly and insert the tampon far enough, it won't hurt to insert one and you won't really be able to feel it while wearing it. My stepdaughter began using them without problems for her second period, just 3 months after her 11th birthday.<br>  <br>  Helpful advice (beyond the semi-useless package directions)? Yeah... just three things:<br>  <br>  1) Aim the tampon more towards your back than upwards... your vagina actually goes *back* for more than half of its length, not just up, and it's almost parallel to the floor if you're sitting on the john... and push it gently (twisting it back and forth a bit might help it slide more easily) as far in as the applicator will go while you're still holding the end of it. Push the plunger in while holding the barrel in place, then let go of the plunger and withdraw the applicator.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) It'll be easier to do the first time if things are slippery "down there", so don't wipe away any blood and stuff until you've got the tampon in place. If there's very little blood there, just smear a couple of drops of saliva on the tip of the tampon (or its applicator if it has one) and it'll make things a lot more comfortable.<br>  <br>  3) Relaxation is **important**. If relaxing isn't easy for you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to poop or pee... your pelvic muscles will relax a bit and that will help a *lot*.<br>  <br>  There's also an OK video instruction about it at <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-insert-a-tampon-235629/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|BfgsEmtJaa	If you have access to a pool you can always say you want to use it for that.

Perhaps the greatest advantage of echocardiography is that it is an entirely risk-free procedure and confers no known biologic risk to the patients, operators, pregnant women, or fetuses. Standard transthoracic  echocardiography is a painless examination that can be accomplished in 15 to 60 minutes, depending on the detail with which the examination must be accomplished.<br>  The major disadvantage of echocardiography is the potential for limited applicability in some patient subsets. Ultrasonography transmits without distortion through fluid and body tissues, but it is not transmitted through bone and it reflects intensively off air-containing structures. As such, obese patients may have poor acoustic windows that limit the ability to visualize the cardiac structures adequately. Additionally, patients with obstructive lung disease represent problematic imaging.<br>  So,don't worry about it.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).

No you can't spread around cancer. You don't sound very informed about anything.<br>  <br>  lol alex!<br>  <br>  A large database study from Scandinavia has laid to rest fears that cancer might be transmitted in blood transfusions. The authors studied 354 094 people who had received blood products between 1968 and 2002. The 12 012 (3%) who received products from donors who later developed cancer were no more likely to develop cancer themselves than other recipients (adjusted relative risk 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07), over a median follow-up of seven years. These reassuring findings survived several sensitivity analyses, held firm for all types of cancer, and were derived from reliable national data on all transfusions and donations in both Sweden and Denmark. The authors are fairly sure that the risks of cancer remain negligible even 20 years after transfusion of products from an affected donor. Donors were said to have preclinical cancer if they developed disease less than five years after donating blood. Does that put your mind at rest?
V0yVM8Unaa	this is long. i wanted to help you.<br>  <br>  DO NOT POP YOUR PIMPLES! you will regret it in the future...just aviod picking them at all costs! you said u want to aviod acne scars, popping your pimples is what causes acne scars. <br>  if you mild acne...a few bumps/blackheads then do not go with proactiv...this is for people with moderate acne...proactiv contains benzoyl peroxide (kills acne causing bacteria) which can really irratate the skin...so if your skin is sensative it may cause a bad reaction. i used proactiv when my pimples were not bad...and even though it helped, it irratated my skin like mad..i wouldnt use it again. however, everyones skin it different. what works for one person may not work for the other. so you can try it if you want, but like i said if your acne is mild, don't use it! <br>  for your blackheads the BEST thing to use is st ives apricot scrub for blackheads and blemishes. you can get it at your local drugstore...somewhere like target. make sure to be gentle with the scrub, don't try to scrub away the acne..that will only aggravate it. <br>  <br>  also make sure that you drink at least 8 glasses of water a day...this will work wonders for your skin. water cleanses your body and delivers nutrients to your body...it rejuvinates u and it GREATT for the skin.<br>  if your breakouts are due to hormones, try taking fish oil capsules....this will balance your hormones. <br>  some more tips:<br>  make sure u are stress free! this is a leading contributor to acne<br>  make sure you get a good nights sleep...your skin heals itself while you are sleeping<br>  excersize! great for maintaining good health and skin<br>  **acne is not caused by outside bacteria and dirt, this is a common misconception...if it were true all contruction workers would breakout like mad. acne is caused internally...meaning something in your body is not functioning the way it should be. eating healthy is extrememly important. <br>  if you want to find out more about acne, there is an excellent site which offers all the information in the world. it was started by this women fran who had severe acne and now is clear. shes an expert. check out the website<br>  highonhealth.org<br>  it is free! look through the forums and through her videos and blogs! i hope you join...you'll find out a lot of information<br>  i hope i helped!=)|`|GzzvdWgaaa	Go to a dermatologist...

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, your one leg being shorter than the other could be a cause for the pain that you are having in your neck (an example only).<br>  <br>  I would recommend a consultation with a foot specialist called a Podiatrist to have them evaluate the situation further.  The reason that I am recommending a Podiatrist is because sometimes problems with the feet can also cause pain and problems in other parts of the body like the back, neck, and even in to the head.<br>  <br>  Even before doing that though I would recommend letting your mom know about your tense muscles in the neck area each day so that she can help you keep an eye on this.  Also, I would recommend checking with your regular doctor as well to see what they say.

rpnFxnCQaa	Leah,<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I used to suffer from anxiety/agoraphobia.<br>  <br>  I was thinking too much. I had anxiety attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. Looking back, I feel I should have taken action way earlier. But anyway, that's the past.<br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of the side effects (that's just my opinion, do not ever quit a medical treatment without asking your doctor). That's when I discovered a program that cured me. It is a 100% natural method. You can find it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  Ask your parents about it, though!<br>  <br>  The key of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop.<br>  Tackle the issue ASAP. You can get rid of it - others have, I have.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|inST4SlAaa	seroquel is a prescription medicine that helps but is not addicting<br>  <br>  xanax works over 4 hours - works the quickest<br>  <br>  valium works over 8 hours<br>  <br>  clonazopam work over 12 hours - takes more time<br>  <br>  these last three are addicting, especially the xanax.  the faster it works the more of the initial high.  these drugs should be used as a bridge to find permanent ways to control these attacks such as therapy.  a support group would really help because you can talk to others who have similiar symptoms|`|ed6562c49fcee88e09ec5bb03c28720aaa	I would recommend staying away from caffeine, as it can make anxiety and panicky feelings worse, and suggest drinking herbal chamomile tea, which is known to make you feel relaxed. Meditation can also help with relaxation. <br>  <br>  Ativan is one of the more commonly used anti-anxiety drugs, and unfortunately you can become dependent on it if you're not careful. The best thing you can do is go to a doctor and talk to them about how you're feeling.<br>  <br>  edit: Since the second commenter mentioned Seroquel I thought I should chime in. I was on that for a few years and there are some very nasty side effects. It can cause serious weight gain and diabetes, and often makes you feel tired and doped up most of the time.

1YdeUn1Caa	My grandparents are 87 and 83 and have been smoking for over 60 years, with no signs of quitting.

They got people believing anything they say. I wish I had that power.|`|PN5wdj9Daa	LOL!! Are you serious?<br>  <br>  The costs of caring for ppl w lung diseases is much higher than the savings and tax money of workers.  With your logic we would promote drug abuse, sexual promiscuity w/o "protection" and overeating.  It is too the advantage of governments to have healthy constituents.  Everyone dies, it is true but ppl act better when they are happier and generally feeling good lends to happiness.|`|25d8bcbbded34c8e695bc727dc17257eaa	Actually, smokers cost a lot to society. Smokers who get different types of sickness are a huge cost on society. Look at cancer treatments and how much they cost. Look at how much group insurance premiums go up because smokers get sick. It is proven that smokers get sick more often then non smokers and when they do not come in to work, it costs society money because there extra income they would have made is not going to be taxed. So no, smokers cost a lot to society. Healthy people work longer meaning they are taxed longer meaning that the overall society is much better off.|`|xxUbFVeFaa	You have obviously not watched anyone die from a smoking related illness. I work in intensive care and have watched too many people make the choice of being put on a ventilator or suffer until they die because they can't breathe. Think about holding your breath under water, and when it gets too hard, you scramble to make it to the surface. The anxiety related to not breathing is intense. Even when you know that you are going to have trouble breathing, and you are going to die soon because of it, you get scared. I have seen it too many times. The amount of money that the government would make from people purchasing tobacco or related products would be miniscule in relation to the amount of costs related to hospitalization of people on state and federal aid. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life paying for people to be in the hospital because they smoked instead of buying groceries or diapers. It is your tax money as well as mine, and although I do think that there is a place for public aid, I don't think that the government should be promoting ways for me to unnecissarily spend my tax money.|`|1cDo3REBaa	no 'cos although they get **** loads of money from it they have to pay when people end up with cancer!<br>  <br>  and people who don't smoke have better teeth generally :p|`|spRtQKaWaa	if you value money over lives, then yeah.|`|FgYSqmvfaa	Well why not just start drinking poison since all non-poison drinkers end up dying anyways?<br>  <br>  Smoking not only shortens your life, it significantly reduces its quality. I would much rather die healthy at 75 than at 65 of lung cancer with the last 5 of those years being in and out of hospitals. <br>  <br>  Why would government promote smoking? So that they have to spend billions more dollars on health care for all the smokers.|`|p9H0FpPcaa	You'll have a much healthier life, so you'll live only a little shorter life, but you will be so unhealthy you'll be wheezing by the time you finally get up out of your TV chair.

Never hesitate to ask a doctor about health concerns, they are far more reliable than people on Yahoo. Chances are they have more medical training, too. :-P<br>  <br>  About your smell and appearance, you may be cleaning "too" thoroughly. Your vagina wants some bacteria down there, it helps to keep it healthy and moist. If you clean too much and/or with a harsh soap, that can kill what is supposed to be down there and introduce new bacteria that isn't. Try using a baby soap like Johnson and Johnson or whatever you prefer. Just make sure that it is a gentle cleanser.<br>  <br>  First off, ask your boyfriend what he thinks and stress his need to be honest. I know it's a weird thing to ask, but I've asked mine and he's given me positive (and not so positive, hehe) reviews. Generally, if you eat fruits with a higher citrus content, that should "sweeten" you up a bit. Taking vitamins daily should help as well, as a chemical imbalance may be affecting you.

When there is a fever it indicates an infection in this case your ear. Depending on what your Doctor finds he may be able to prescribe a  potent  Antibiotic, or if  the need may be to send you to a specialist an Otolarygologist. Take care of ear infections ASAP or it may become quite serious and effect your hearing.  Best wishes, and get well soon.
vEobDY1haa	What on earth makes you think you need to lose 25 lbs!!!<br>  14 years old, at 5'6 125 pounds is perfect.<br>  Sweetie, losing 25 pounds in a week can result in water weight loss (which is not fat. just water) and it comes right back. and you can also put your body into starvation mode. This happens because in order to lose 25 pounds in such a short time would mean that you over-exersize yourself and eat significantly less. Starvation mode is when your body hold ONTO body fat because it needs it to survive.<br>  <br>  A HEALTHY way i found to keep my metabolism up and have better energy was to eat 5 HEALTHY meals a day. (whole grains, low sugar, brown rice, veggies, fruits, and lots of protein) <br>  You are 14, keep being active, eat HEALTHY and tell anyone who thinks you are "fat" to f* off. you are just fine.|`|YDoNiqxbaa	The simple way to lose weight is determination.

FicyC2TXaa	Sorry but I share April's scepticism. In your other questions you say you have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the last couple of weeks. Breast cancer is almost unheard of at your age, but if you had been diagnosed that recently you would be preparing for or recovering from surgery right now, or undergoing other treatments. Yet in another question you say you have an job interview with MacDonald's today.<br>  <br>  What cancer drug are you asking about? There is no 'cancer drug'. Your doctors have already explained the appropriate treatments, haven't they?<br>  <br>  What grade is your breast cancer? What stage? Any lymph node involvement? Er+, pr+? Or er -?  HER+ or -? All these things and more will have helped your medical team decide on your treatment<br>  <br>  =====<br>  <br>  The more of your questions I read, the clearer it is: you haven't been diagnosed with anything, have you? That's why you know so little about cancer you believe that there's a 'cancer drug'.<br>  <br>  The trouble with posting things like this in the Cancer forum is that several people reading your questions will have a lot of experience of cancer, and can spot a fib a mile off.

wqaqdq1Waa	Wisconsin certainly is endemic for Lyme disease and your son's symptoms are consistent with that diagnosis. However because of the controversies and politics of Lyme disease, it can be difficult to get a diagnosis and appropriate treatment.  <br>  <br>  I'd suggest getting some basic information on LD from www.lymedisease.org and then joining your state online support group, where other patients can guide you to a doctor who is well-informed about Lyme. If you are still in WI, that group would be <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/wisconsinlyme">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/wis...</a><br>  <br>  Don't rush into this uninformed because the usual tests are inaccurate.

2sycPf8Daa	It is my heart rate too high? What's a normal heart rate?<br>  <br>  For an adult, a normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). For a well-trained athlete, a normal resting heart rate may be as low as 40 to 60 bpm. In healthy adults, a lower heart rate at rest generally implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. <br>  <br>  To measure your heart rate at home, simply check your pulse. Place two fingers on the thumb side of your wrist, or place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. When you feel your pulse, look at your watch and count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by 4 to get your heart rate per minute. <br>  <br>  Although there's a wide range of normal, an unusually high or low heart rate may indicate an underlying problem. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 bpm (tachycardia) or below 60 bpm (bradycardia) — especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath. <br>  <br>  Look after yourself as always!|`|2f33210399c03b3166e4e868697b9157aa	Thats a bit high - do you feel energized, excitable, have a tremor, sweat or breath heavy often?<br>  <br>  Make sure you haven't been counting wrong.

e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	It's not good for your sweat glands to clog them up with antiperspirant. Since you have an extreme problem, you might want to experiment with thin, absorbent underarm pads. Women have used them for years.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Go to the doctor and get a stronger Rx since,your a freak and isn't working the NORMAL ones for you.|`|AA10496780	You can't stop but you can use an antiperspirant and deodorant like Arrid Extra Dry|`|vJxuWyueaa	Deodorant.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Did you try Certain Dry? Put it on under your arms at night before you go to bed.|`|lbR1IoiSaa	Okay, although I'm a female, I have struggled with severe sweating problems since a small stroke completely changed my chemistry a few years ago, so here is what I've learned, and I hope it helps you!<br>  <br>  1)  Although you say "right guard professional strength" may be the "best stuff out there", you need to look at the ingredients list to see if their proof is in the pudding.  The 'active' ingredients should be more than 17% - and you should look for a 'deodrant' that is BOTH: antiperspirant (which will actually stop the sweating), and deodrant (which will stop the odor).  If you're using just strictly a deodrant, well there is your problem.   Try a "prescription strength" brand, or even switch up your brands.  Sometimes our bodies build a sort of tolerance to the same ol' same ol'.  <br>  <br>  2)  You should put antiperspirant / deodrant on AT NIGHT before you  go to bed, NOT right after a shower.  The reasons for this are twofold: your body is at a resting stage, and will not be 'gearing up' for the day, and because it takes an hour or so for antiperspirants / deodrants to start working.  So if you shower in the morning, then put on your stuff, your body is already working, so what you do put on, will fail because you'll start sweating before it can start to work :P.  <br>  <br>  3)  If you have to shower in the morning, be sure you rinse your underarms with cold water, and then stay cool (exit the steamy bathroom right away) so your pores can close.  After you dry your underarms, blot some baby powder on them right away.  Then do your antiperspirant/deodrant. <br>  <br>  4)  Carry antiperspirant/deodrant in your car so you can top off if you feel yourself getting close to that point again. <br>  <br>  5)  If all else fails, see a dermatologist.  Injections of Botox in the underarms have proven to provide relief for folks like you (and I), who seem to have this consistent and resistant problem. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps!|`|BH7VpjJNaa	I have the same problem, but I'm female.  A co-worker suggested Secret Clinical Strength and so far it has been working well.  It is strong enough for a man per the commercial though.  LOL.  Seriously, I tried all kinds of deordorants and even tried the mineral stone from the health food store and nothing worked.  I hear they are using botox injections to control people that sweat profusely.  Just be glad you are a guy.  It's much more acceptable for a guy to be sweaty than a girl.|`|Y1s6rW5Qaa	I had the same problem with sweaty palms, and my dr. prescribed me Drysol...it has worked wonders with my hands and I read you can use it under your arms to..I would just talk to you doctor about it..It might also be available OTC now.|`|da7e2c9eeb0a1fbddf0a3ae3ac4aa951aa	well my dad had the same problem and he got botox injected in his armpits and it seemed to help him stop but you have ton go back every 6 months and its only like $300 costly but worth it in the long run,|`|DzUxBehhaa	Wash+Speed Stick!|`|hn83qJpgaa	The only way to COMPLETELY stop the sweating under your arms (besides surgical removal of the sweat glands that is) is Botox injections about every 4-6 months. It is not permanent, but it totally stops any sweating under your arms about 3 days after the treatment, and works anywhere from 3-6 months depending on your body.<br>  <br>  I live in Orange County, the capital of plastic and cosmetic surgeries. Botox treatment here is about $1,000-$1,200 per session. I have no idea if it would be more or less anywhere else around the country.<br>  <br>  I couldn't figure out why I used to sweat so much under my arms - I'd trim the hair under there, wear all different kinds of organic or toxic chemical strength deodorant, and none of it did anything. Anyway, I walked into a high end skin therapy clinic one day because I was interested in getting Botox injections in my hands to stop the sweating there. This therapist didn't do that, but she suggested it for my underarms instead - which I had never thought of. <br>  <br>  The procedure: He or she will lead you into a separate room, where you'll take off your shirt and lay flat on the type of bed you see in a doctor's office. They'll ask questions like, "Does one armpit sweat more than the other?" and, "How long has this been a problem for you" and so on. Then, they'll swab iodine on your armpits and sprinkle corn starch. The corn starch reacts with the iodine and turns your sweat glands purple or black, so the therapist knows where to inject the botox. It takes about 3-5 minutes per armpit after they find all the sweat glands, and the injections are only slightly painful, but the pain is instant and goes away as soon as the needle is removed. I would guess they poke your armpit anywhere between 20-30 times, but I can't be sure. Some pokes you don't feel at all, and others are more noticeable. Then they'll do the other arm, and you're done.<br>  <br>  You should be in and out the door of their office in about 30 minutes. It's very easy, only minimally invasive, and is totally worth it.<br>  <br>  If you have health insurance, you may want to try visiting a dermatologist and see if you can be diagnosed with hyperhydrosis. That is the term for excessive sweating. Make sure it's a dermatologist who uses Botox before you confirm your appointment. Your health insurance may cover some or all of the cost of a Botox treatment, which is about $1,000-$1,200 in Orange County.<br>  <br>  If you don't have health insurance, or your insurance won't cover the cost of the Botox treatment, then go to any high end skin therapy clinic, such as one where they offer Botox, microdermabrasion, laser treatment, and so on. Simply call their office and set up a consultation. Remember - it's expensive. But it's totally worth it.<br>  <br>  If you can't pay for the cost of treatment in full, most clinics will be affiliated with a company called CareCredit. You can apply for financing with various promotional terms that offer low or 0% interest rates.

MoHWjIGWaa	It's dangerous to mix them.Stick to the ambien only. If you drink caffeine...what's the point?|`|QT0qTFyAaa	You shouldn't take more than one Ambien at a time. Try taking one Ambien with half a tab of OTC sleep aid. For me it increases the effect of Ambien. It is up to you to try this, but tell your doc you are still having sleep issues.|`|2Fu6qLg5aa	It wouldn't be a very good idea to take Advil PM and Ambien together.  Advil PM contains diphenhydramine, a first generation antihistamine that causes moderate sedation.  Ambien also has sedative properties, and may contribute to increased CNS depression if taken with diphenhydramine.  As a side note, taking more than 10mg of Ambien a day can be dangerous unless prescriped by your physician.<br>  So you can take either the Advil pm OR the Ambien, or find some plain Advil to take with the Ambien that doesn't contain diphenhydramine.  You can drink caffeine at any time, but remember not to drink any before going to bed, as it may counteract the sedative effects of the Ambien.

For example, if you were obese then you'd lost weight a lot faster than someone who is an average weight, or just slightly overweight.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to lose a stone in a few months. For example, I have lost 18lbs since the beginning of January, which is 1 stone and 4lbs.<br>  <br>  There are simple easy things you've gotta do which is using less butters and oils whilst cooking, and cutting down on that odd chocolate bar you might have once every few days. Eventually, after a few weeks, aim to not snack at all. Yep, it's really hard but you've gotta try hard, so think of something that will really motivate you, like thinking about what you could look like after a few months if you stay away from bad foods, and if you do eat it, how bad you'll feel after. Do not EVER eat after 7pm. If you really wanna be good then don't eat after 6pm. But 7pm is the complete latest. It doesn't matter how healthy the snack is, don't eat it. The only thing going into your mouth after 7pm is water.<br>  You should also drink lots of water in the day. Usually, when your stomache is telling your brain you're hungry, you're just thirsty!<br>  <br>  Exercising is a lot easier than people make out. I do aerobics in my bedroom and it's easy. Just get an iPod or MP3 and move! Even have a little dance around. Or, if you don't have an iPod or MP3 player, play music out loud. Whatever you choose to do, just move!<br>  I also go on a 20 minute walk every day. Remember that even a little bit of exercise is better than no exercise.<br>  Then of course, do the simple things that'll burn even just a few calories. For example, if you get a bus often, then walk to the next stop and then get on the bus, or if the journey isn't that far, walk the whole way. If you drive to a lot of places then park further away from your destination and walk. During lunch breaks go for a little walk, even if it's just for 15 mintues, it's better than nothing.<br>  <br>  Chew gum. It'll keep your mind and mouth focused on something other than food, and if you buy an expensive gum, then you'll feel guilty about just throwing it in the bin, and you'll try and get as many chews as you can from it. I understand about eating from boredom, so try and find something really fun to do while you're at home!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to email me if you need any more tips! <br>  <br>  :)
98bupiDFaa	Don't focus on weight as much as just getting in shape.  You can lose inches and "tone" up by cutting fat, but you might actually gain weight...however, you will look and feel alot better.  Problems arise when people get hung up on the number on the scale instead of just concentrating on eating healthy and implementing a sufficient workout routine into their life.|`|LFTGozfKaa	Toning up shows muscle definition and symmetry.  If you are not losing weight it is hard to tell if the definition is there.  You first have to do cardio to loose the fat, which will cause you to loose weight.  Then, tone up to see the muscle definition.  For example, everyone has a six pack.  But in order to see it, you have to burn the fat sitting on top of it (cardio).  All the crunches and sit ups in the world won't help if you don't burn the fat off of your stomach area.|`|tIldpr7vaa	toning up is losing fat. Fat doesnt turn into muscle, thats a myth.

R9KvEhMxaa	You can measure it, but it's diagnostically useless. It's really just a matter of extracting the CSF and running it through GC/MS, unless there's some form of spectroscopy I'm unaware of for inositol. Taking something like that and turning it into a diagnostic test requires gathering utter mountains of clinical data to establish the specificity and sensitivity of that test.<br>  <br>  Also, there's a tremendous risk associated with CSF sampling from the spine that would prevent it from being widely used.

It is unavoidable, since doing X activates the very same circuit in the brain, and with every other time you get less excited when you use it.<br>  You also need to be aware that you need to give yourself a break to restore some magic - I think I get the best effect when I use it once a month or less. Doing it several days in the row is plain stupidity - the fuel for your fire does not replenish that quick.<br>  <br>  I preach smart use of X. That means no alcohol, no driving, no binging, lots of water (I don't get the urge to binge use the X at all, but I know a lot of ppl who have trouble controlling themselves). <br>  It is helpful (but not necessary) to preload on 5-HTP beforehand (precursor of dopamine), which gives your body an extra stack of firewood for your fire, in case you run out of it in the process, or if your body metabolism does not produce enough of it.<br>  It is also beneficial to take some 5-HTP the morning after to replenish the supply of it in your system and eliminate the crash (hangover). <br>  If you have prozac in your medicine cabinet - taking some the morning after also eliminates the crash. <br>  Some people get the blues the next day, some don't - the reaction is individual. I don't. I feel even better than normal the next day.<br>  <br>  I see X as a healthier (I am serious) alternative to drinking overpriced liquor in clubs ($15-20 for X beats $50-$100 for booze). <br>  Taking X also works wonders for my social anxiety!<br>  <br>  What you need to do (if you do it) - is to find your dose and stick to it. Taking too much of it, or if a pill is very strong (rare case) will make you lose your short-term memory, your pupils will dilate so much that things will appear further than they are (you will literraly bump into people you talk to), you will start biting your lips, cheeks and tongue, it also makes you loopy. Usually it takes more than 2-3 pills to reach this level of intoxication, but megastrong pills could do that to you from just one. You don't want this! Stay on the safe side.<br>  Usually manufacturers are pretty good on dosage, but never eat more than one pill, if you haven't had this particular kind yet. It's better to be safe than sorry.<br>  Never give a full pill to a person who has never done it - some people are oversensitive to X, and you never know... My fiancee, for example, asked me to drive her home just from a 1/2 of the pill - she couldn't handle it.<br>  <br>  As I said earlier, binging, or following one pill with another after it wears off is stupid. You can't burn your fire when your body is out of firewood, seriously.<br>  <br>  To conclude, I wanted to advokate the recreational use of X if done smartly. <br>  Stupid abusers give X a bad name, when it is not as bad as it seems.<br>  Alcohol is waaay worse on side effects and less euphoric.<br>  <br>  People who abuse X don't do it because they feel an urge to binge, X doesn't give you that! They do it because they abuse everything they use just out of personal issues, lack of information or culture.<br>  X can be sitting in my desk drawer forever waiting for the right party, I never feel the urge to reach in there and pop one for no reason.<br>  (I know some other drugs I cannot keep in my drawer like that)<br>  <br>  I've also seen some medical research showing huge benefits in using MDMA to cure patiens with post-traumatic disorders, emotional problems, social anxieties and lack of empathy, different fobias. I believe that one day X will be a legal prescription drug.<br>  <br>  Aslo, snorting or mainlining pills is pointless. The best way of administration is oral. You should not eat much food when doing X, since it decreases effects, but popping it on a completely empty stomach is bad for your digestive tract - make sure you eat a snack or something.|`|P5VpQnNOaa	girly, its like doing acid, and it messis with ur head, not on it. watching my friend who is, wouldnt try it for the world, and he is growing breast also.. sicko<br>  im 16|`|KqxQlPrNaa	I tried it once when I was 18.

Orange juice helps to kick it in bc it contains vitamin c.<br>  Never had a bad time on X. Only good times! <br>  whenever i rolled with people that had never done it before, their  reactions were all the same. "I love you!" and "Why haven't you told me about this before?"
nAp688tZaa	First of all, not all doctors are right all the time, as Guy suggests.  If I had walked around with my head in the clouds believing that, I would have never been diagnosed with Epilepsy, since the first doctor I saw said my passing out for 20 minutes at a time was anxiety!  So, no, you do not need to trust everything your doctor says.  It is your body and you know when something is wrong.<br>  <br>  Second, x-rays do not show muscle, only bones, so while there may be no structural damage to the bones, there was no way for the doctor to "see" if the reason for your pain was muscular.  This is just something he decided after seeing the radiology report.  If you are experiencing increased pain, and the onset of new symptoms, like the numbness and tingling, then you need to have an MRI or CT scan done.  This is the only way to see the nerve roots and cervical discs clearly.  An injury to the discs or nerve roots in your neck can cause the symptoms you are experiencing with your shoulder.  If your family doctor will not order an MRI, ask for a referral to a neurologist or neurosurgeon to get one done.  Plus, seeing a neurologist is not a bad idea since you are having symptoms that are clearly related to the nerves.  They will be able to recognize the symptoms and order the proper testing.  Good luck and keep in mind that the doctor works for you.  If he is unwilling to help you find the answer to your symptoms, then it is time for a new doctor.  Again, you know your body better than anyone and know when there is something more going on than just a muscle spasm.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	You sound like you have a pinched nerve in your neck as your arms are bieng affected.  A pinched nerve in your neck will cause these problems as a nerve or nerves are being impinged.  The nerves in our neck travel through our arms.  The longer you wait the more damage to your neck and arms.  Go to your dr and demand an MRI or see a neurologist who can help you diagnose your nerve problem and find a solution, you should not have to live like this.  X rays will not show tissues and nerves but an MRI will.  Sitting for long periods of time puts pressure on your neck.  You dont' have to have trauma to have this problem a degenerative disc disease will cause this just wear and tear or it could be hereditary or age related.    You have numbness a big red flag that denotes a PINCHED NERVE IN YOUR NECK!!!!  See a neuroloigist if your dr won't order more itensive tests.  You are right there is a problem.  Good luck!!!!!|`|H6GIYDdzaa	The Doctors are qualified in this field and you are not, trust the Doctors they know what they're doing.

Some people have more side effects compared to others.  Chemo isn't the only way to treat cancer and not all cancers are treated with chemo.  Chemo is the best way of getting rid of any cancer that may have spread which increases overall survival.  That's why it is used.|`|vWm1l9nuaa	Take one thing at a time. First you need to establish whether you have it or not. For that you need to see a doctor. it might turn out that you don′t have cancer after all. If it turns out that you have it, the next thing you have to do is to discuss treatment options (again - with your doctor). Chances are that it may be totally curable by surgery alone. Should it turn out so that chemotherapy is recommended you should really have an in-depth discussion with an oncologist of what can be achieved by chemotherapy and what the side effects might be. Chemotherapy can be very tough to go through, but many have. But first of all focus on the fact that chemotherapy might not even be necessary. And this is especially so if you go see the doctor as soon as possible.|`|t27SvIPbaa	I don't wish to offend you, I merely want to expose the cancer con.<br>  <br>  There are many successful cancer treatments around the world but are suppressed by governments, pharmaceutical industries and the mainstream media.<br>  <br>  Cancer treatment is the biggest money making racket after war and oil.<br>  Especially chemotherapy which is very expensive and has no medical or scientific evidence that it is successful in the treatment of cancer.<br>  <br>  Yes it sometimes stops cancer temporally, but it only cuts the branches off and not the root of the tree. So that it comes back within 5 years and then they get to use the treatment again before the patient dies.<br>  <br>  Chemotherapy also kills people’s good cells permanently, so if they have a weak immune system they will not survive the treatment.<br>  Yet chemotherapy, surgery and radio therapy are the only options for patients, none of which totally destroys the cancer for good.<br>  <br>  Think about it, we were told that in the 1960's they had the advanced technology to land three astronauts on the moon and bring them back to earth without a scratch.<br>  <br>  YET 50 YEARS LATER WITH OVER A HUNDERED YEARS OF RESEARCH, TRILLIONS OF POUNDS IN FUNDING AND THOUSANDS OF SPECIAL SCIENTISTS AND RESEARHERS ..........and they haven’t found a cure yet?

D81hhlKSaa	Eating right after your exercise is a really good time to eat. What I do is work out around 4:30 so I'm done by 6 and eat dinner right afterward. Your metabolism it at it's slowest the latest in the day. Usually rule of thumb, the more tired you are the lower your metabolism is. So by working out later in the day you'll keep your metabolism higher later in the night. Plus after working out your metabolism will be highest it will be all day so eating right after you work out is definitely the best time to eat.

Almost all drugs will interact differently with different people and the amount and timing of alcohol intake. It only takes once to verify when it doesn't work and you have screwed up big time. If you want to get better with the super bugs out there ready to bite you in the butt, make sure your doctor has no liability and you have no kids or spouse to explain why you didn't make it. A week of looking back and saying, "that wasn't too bad going without drinking" is really worth it for the people close to you.|`|0kU1Ro8maa	I don't think it is a good idea to mix alcohol and antibiotics.

You usually need to have specific tests you want them to run as order by your doctor or employer.<br>  <br>  If your doctor orders you to go for general blood work, he or she will include documentation of exactly which tests the labs will need to run.  They won't just run tests for "everything under the sun."  You don't have enough blood for them to do that.|`|5s8fp6Dgaa	yeah|`|hlYZeY4vaa	Usually, you have to specifically ask your doctor for that type of test, with signed consent. However, they could find abnormal antibodies and want to do a follow up. It sounds like you may be a little worried about contracting something. Have the doctor do an STD screening if you are concerned. Best of luck.|`|AA10450066	Any blood work will come back abnormal if you have AIDS or HIV positive.|`|AUsvrW8faa	The doctor can see things but he's not going to check for AIDS unless it's an AIDS test.|`|Tm9kA5umaa	lol very likely yes. that all depends on wut u've been doing though ;) for example, if ur worried cause of pot dont be somthing more seroius such as heroine... get worried|`|hvUnMwMWaa	doctor needs to do tests in the lab for whatever it is but usually the result is upon patient request. for example when my wife got pregnant they had to take a lot of blood to test it like aids, iron deficiency, calcium deficiency and all sorts of tests.|`|GbBSA3Cgaa	Of course! Just because the blood test isn't 4 anything specific doesn't mean there's no possibility of anything being wrong.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Duh!!!|`|AEJFCUOOaa	no.|`|Q7st7Uasaa	They test your blood anyways, it's a precautionary measure.|`|KLMVn7Egaa	DUH,  thats why your there right.  to have the doctor look you over and look over your blood.  dude,  think about it.|`|FRNDkLNqaa	if your scared he might find something wrong with you then you most likely know you have something wrong with you|`|fyKydb6Iaa	that is why blood tests are part of a check up|`|7C6pTKwraa	Yes|`|D4gR8Y4aaa	Yes. Very possible.<br>  I went for a blood test lst month because my dermotologist wanted to put me on accutane, and it turns out that there was something wrong with my liver. if they hadn't found that out, the accutane could have killed me.<br>  <br>  most blood tests are for something specific, but its very possible that they could find out other things.|`|7uSSJPMKaa	Doctors don't do blood tests for nothing specific.  They have to have an idea of what they are looking for.  No doctor can send your blood for HIV testing without your consent.|`|8373e624184b0685739748535b1d8279aa	no you have to have symptoms for doc to give you blood test then he will only look for that particular illness

Always Feminine Wipes.|`|RF4sYpPbaa	Go to your local grocery store<br>  they have soaps and thing for that type of thing.<br>  usually around the tampons, wipes, douches area.|`|CJkZpWv0aa	Soap and water will do the trick.|`|jVGnfoa8aa	The vagina has a certain smell to it but it's not a gross smell, it's like a light odor... that smells like bread kindof like yeast maybe? I really never thought about how to compare it to a smell, if you are a clean person and you wash your vaginal area with a washcloth and wear clean panties you should be fine. Sometimes if you skip a shower, or don't wash correctly, or if you have alot of pube hair and you sweat that can cause odor like your armpits. I know a girl that would have her period and she had alot of hair because she never shaved or trimmed and she wouldn't douche or sit in a bath after showering with some anti- persprint soap and sucking up in there and then pushing it out to cleanse it. After your period or sex there is still stuff up there stuck to the vaginal canal wall and it turns into bacteria and it starts to smell it's like a infection. I use a douche after I have my period and after I have sex I shower using Dove " white" bar and I scrub very good and then I rinse off and clean out the  tub and then I fill it up and i hold the soap under the faucet and I rub it between my hand into a lather so it will run into the tub and I lay back and use my vaginal muscles and suck up the water and hold it in for a few seconds then I push it out. <br>  If you only use body wash and not soap , it's not a good idea because it's not cleaning like you need it to it's just smothering the odor. <br>  If you go into the store find where the tampons and pads are located and there should be a section where they have douches and tons of different other stuff that helps with odor or itching issues down there. They also have treatment if you have a yeast infection or if you have a urinary tract infection.If none of these ideas work go see your doc and she should be able to help you. Good luck

4bZou8qQaa	I would fill the prescription. It's probably an antibiotic. If the tooth is hurting, it's probably infected and once the infection is gone the pain will be gone also.

jvLCHuqTaa	Botox can be a good option for Hyperhidrosis, which it sounds like you may have. The treatment includes getting botox injections into the areas that you have excess sweating. These treatments usually take effect within 48hours and usually last around 6months. They do cost on average between $700 - $1000 per treatment. BotoxForum is a leading resource for botox information. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|SI67vQNuaa	I work at a derm office and they will prescribe Botox injections for hyperhidrosis when all other treatments fail.  Other treatments include Certain Dry, Drysol, and Robinul.  It does seem to have some good success and some people get the injections on a regular basis because it works so well.  Insurance may approve the injections if the doctor puts in for prior approval for your condition and states you have failed all other treatments.  I am not sure of the out of pocket expense, it may vary from doctor to doctor.

Honestly, it feels great to know that what I'm eating isn't going to kill me!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	The fact that eating sensibly and healthily has made me lose inches off my waist and thighs and back.|`|WOifuL4Xaa	Being able to go to the beach and not be embarrassed.|`|meNVobdLaa	1. girls 2. sports and teams 3. feeling great|`|nSj24FXpaa	what motivates me is basically knowing that i wont get fat. my dad is obese and i mean i love him but i just cant get like him i wont let myself.|`|Qt3yUHsHaa	how good your going to feel afterwards or finding the right spices or combinations to make the foods taste better. find a kind of excersize that you enjoy doing.. like a certain sport|`|kG5prgAHaa	Looking like I have Katy Perry's body!|`|aXnVFFUkaa	usually looking in the mirror motivates me to go to the gym <br>  <br>  but i love brocolli and veg so i eat loads of it|`|jQglJiMhaa	Feeling fantastic is what motivates me!  When I exercise I feel better about myself, and it wears off on everyone around me, they see me happier, and they think I look great.  When you feel great, you look great.  It build you confidence in every aspect of your life.  Its all worth the sweat and occasionally sore muscle!!!
5nJe3B8Maa	Don't listen to the loser above me with the mononucleosis thing! Try drinking warm milk before sleeping it actually does help sometimes. Also maybe there's something on your mind that's not allowing you to sleep. I've had plenty of horrible nights because I was busy thinking about a problem try to release that by keeping a journal and letting that stress or whatever it is go. Listening to soft music might help. Someimes I literally have to concentrate on falling asleep because my mind is racing but when I focus on sleeping and don't let my mind drift off I always get some zzzzzz's! Hope this helps !|`|uIfbWdsvaa	well i uswed to have this problem and still do actually, <br>  <br>  reading honestly is the best for me, andi love to rad to.

Its not a sleeping pill but an increased amount of it in your system will help your body adjust to sleep and let you stay asleep.|`|orGvWwhBaa	This isn't natural, but it isn't a pill or a medicine either. You can get this balm called "Sleeptherapy" from Avon which you just apply a dab on your temples before you sleep. I'm 16 and I could hardly ever sleep, but this works a treat for me.<br>  <br>  If you are reluctant to try this, go out more and be more active to wear yourself out more. Also, try to relax before you go to bed. Turn off your phone, television, computer [etc.] and relax by listening to soft Easy-Listening music or reading a book. Or maybe even having a nice warm bath with candles.|`|DlP4ZM0iaa	you can get a hormone supplement called melatonin, marijuana actual increases its production in the brain or you could try Valerian root extract supplements or both together for trippy dreams.|`|rSXZOU5zaa	Whats up with the 'ii' thing? <br>  Anyways. I heard milk helps. And chamomile tea.|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	Weed... what?... its natural...|`|4Quo7TB2aa	The key is to watch something boring on tv and don't go to bed until you feel like you can sleep. Don't go to bed and wait for sleep because it will never come. If you would like to take a natural medicine then I recommend Valerian Root, I take it and it works great! You can find it at Walmart and Walgreens in the vitamin sections.|`|TQWUQKgBaa	develop a schedule in which it would benefit your craving for sleep. If you tell me that you don't sleep every day, I would not believe you. You just have to time it right with an appropiate schedule. On the other hand, if you mean you can't get into the right mood with good sleeping habits, clean out your bed with a steamer, I did it last week, and I have NEVER got better sleep. It's amazing, and smells fresh :D|`|St2ZqreSaa	Get Infectious mononucleosis.|`|eMY9VhEeaa	count sheep. or smoke weed. both are fun and safe.|`|HJB1P7Doaa	get up earlier and stay physically active all day

Just keep in mind, anything in excess can cause problems, and should not be practiced chronically. However, as to your question, no it cannot.|`|0ewX5wZ0aa	This is an old myth, here are some quotes from my source!<br>  <br>  "They say cancer-causing chemicals could build up in the prostate if men do not ejaculate regularly."<br>  <br>  "And they say sexual intercourse may not have the same protective effect because of the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted infection, which could increase men's cancer risk."<br>  <br>  "Men who ejaculated more than five times a week were a third less likely to develop prostate cancer later in life."|`|e8ZsSpFHaa	maybe you skipped a word because it prevents and lowers the risk of prostate cancer|`|WxIrMOyXaa	they said that frequent flushing of the semen can help to prevent prostate cancer|`|SltEwVX7aa	Chronic masturbation also causes hairy palms and could make you go blind.<br>  <br>  actually, it's worse if you DON'T jerk it.  you need to keep things emptied out down there.  and let's face it, masturbation is about the safest sex you can have.  And, it's free.<br>  <br>  getting prostate cancer is more of a genetic predisposition thing.  and, guys are living longer and so it's starting to show up more.  <br>  <br>  jerk away.  it's harmless.|`|1oNi2v38aa	Last I heard it lowered the chance of prostate cancer...
sQu3LLqtaa	Besides warm milk, melatonin, valerian and 5-HTP you can find other remedies in web searches for "natural sleep remedies" and "natural sleep aids".|`|ldfE9vNGaa	There are lots of things that you can try which might help you fall asleep faster.<br>  <br>  Get yourself a regular 'bedtime routine' - it's not just for little kids! By following the same kind of pattern every night, you will signal your body that it is time for sleep. Make the routine relaxing - maybe a warm bath/shower, a hot milky drink, some quiet music that you find relaxing... no loud music, computer games etc.<br>  <br>  Aromatherapy is a great way to relax and get your body ready for sleep. You can use diffusers, lotions, vaporizers, candles... the list goes on. A few drops in a warm bath also work wonders.<br>  <br>  Check out the links below for lots more tips and advice on getting a good nights' sleep. Best of luck, hope it helps.

uVMlNvLoaa	If you can't reach your doctor or gynecologist, you can talk to your school female counselor (or male, if you feel comfortable) and they can reference you to clinics in the area where they can root out the problem. Missing periods, while it can be sometimes commonplace in your cycle, can signal more serious problems or hormone imbalances. They're also good to just talk about with your everyday problems--go ahead, they're trained (and paid fairly decently) to do their job--get your parent's tax money's worth. :)<br>  <br>  Planned Parenthood is not just for sexually active and pregnant teens: it's a really good reference to have if you have no one else.<br>  <br>  I'm also here, but I can only do so much over the internet. ^^|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	How about talking to a friend's mom? or maybe a school nurse?<br>  As far as your periods being irregular, that is perfectly normal into your late teens, early twenties.|`|1oNi2v38aa	Gynecologist, or general practitioner.|`|udPtqagzaa	A friend, another relative like a cousin/aunty, kind teachers, friend's mums if you have that kind of relationship..
m1Kjxlkvaa	you don't say what age you are, but if you are really young, just enjoy having a nice boyfriend, don't get too heavy, if it is meant to be , you will eventually get together on a more permanent basis, just let your relationship go along at its own pace ,you will know when it is right to say if you love him, just have a lovley time, go out to nice places and enjoy yourself, you have lifetime to settle down,don't keep on at him to say what he feels for you, he will tell you when he is ready, men hate it when women get on at them, asking them all the time what they feel, If you think it is going nowhere, and you want more,then maybe go your own ways|`|ZDdUSL2Naa	Well why dont you ask him where this is going in a kinda casual way, if he turns round and says I dont want anything serious just act like you dont either and if he does then great! Its so hard when you dont know what their feelings towards you are especially when you like him so much but just ask him. Its better to get it over with now before you fall deeper! It sounds like he likes you though seeing as he calls you honey and you spend alot of time together so he must enjoy being with you. It might be too early to tell him how much you like him, wait for him to tell you! Good luck! I hope you get what you want! :)|`|4BndFSAMaa	It seems to me, that you may be a little skeptical, but who wouldn't be. But if you're having fun and being around him genuinely makes you happy, then i say go for it. I believe that you should indeed tell him how you feel. Just casually try and tell him that you might be ready to become more serious. It's okay to be scared, just don't let your fear block what might turn into something great. If his feelings aren't mutual, i suggest you break it off all together. Only because if each of you are interested in two different things, it could get messy. And it can only hurt you more if you stay with someone who doesn't want to commit fully, when you do. <br>  My advice is to tell him. I wish you the best, hope i helped.|`|jQglJiMhaa	You don't have to tell him, but life is full of good and bad.  If i wouldn't have taken to many chances with getting hurt, i probably wouldn't have ever met my husband, who is the absolute love of my life!  Im so glad i didn't hide from getting hurt.<br>  <br>  Every time love hurts you, the next love is that much better!|`|jej0Vnudaa	You sound like you are holding back out of fear of getting hurt.  Maybe you should try talking to him sometime about how you really feel.  Be honest with him and with yourself.  I always appreciate genuine people, and if this guy is as good as you say he is, I think he will, too.

The mass, if sore and throbbing upon touch, should shrink with in 7 to ten days.  If the mass does not hurt and feels firm and nodule like, please make an appointment with a dentist ASAP as to this may involve a more serious matter.
c888be1368c8549a0539963f925c96e7aa	The same thing happens to me too. Are you on antibiotics? That could have something to do with it. In extreme cases (and not so much anymore) dermatologists will place people on antibiotics to fight their acne. I would be willing to bet though that even if you're not, when you're sick your body puts it's immune system into over-load, so those same antibodies that are fighting your cold are probably also fighting the nasty bacteria that causes acne.<br>  <br>  But I'm sure there are several factors that contribute to it. Things like getting more vitamin C, eating less sugars, drinking more water and fluids to help flush toxins from the body. Also, getting lots of rest/sleep is important because that's when your body heals itself. The other answerer also mentioned your sweat, which could contribute. Salt has long been known to have cleansing properties. But like with anything, too much of it and it could cause you to break out more. I'm not entirely sure, but it's something I'd even like to ask my doctor the next time I'm in for a check up!|`|AGlpdpAKaa	it could be related to diet.  when i had my wisdom teeth pulled, my skin was AMAZING.  i dont' have pimples, but my cheeks turn red and i have really dry patches near my mouth sometimes.  anwyays, i couldn't eat anything for 4 or 5 days afterwards, and my skin was incredible.  i'm guessing that when you're sick you don't eat much, and your skin clears up.  your pimples could be caused by citrus fruits, milk, sugar, or gluten. (breads, pasta, cookies, etc)  maybe try an elimination diet.  just eat really bland foods (healthy bland foods though, i'm not talking about rice cakes.)  potato, apple sauce, whole grain bread, yogurt, etc.  nothing with too much sugar, ntohign with too much acid in it.  it might help :)|`|UhroMfoWaa	Because you sweat! Sweat contains substances that kill the bacteria. Also the body heat helps sweat to penetrate and ad moisture in your skin. These two in combination do the work. Use pH 5.5 soap for your skin. It helps to clean the skin without irritations.

7uSSJPMKaa	Dandruff is a fungal infection.  That is why Head and Shoulders works!  The more moisturising rubbish you put on the worse a fungal infection gets.  But dandruff shampoos do work.  Don't share hairbrushes with anyone!  Thats probably hhow you got it.

Check allergy websites for known allergens you may have been or are exposed to such as tree nuts, pollen, certain plant products, animals, insect bites, &c.  <br>  I had a friend who had warts on his hands for years that he could never get rid of until he was diagnosed as being allergic to certain woods.  He cut firewood and built decks and worked with wood for a living so he had to change his livelihood! <br>  <br>  Best of luck figuring out what is causing your reaction.  Also, you might talk to your doctor about getting an EpiPen because allergies generally get worse over time so you might be at risk for anaphylactic shock.|`|7uSSJPMKaa	You haven't been exposed to anything that might have caused an allergy response?  Plants, pets, new detergents or creams? If they tend to be over knuckes, it could be an autoimmune reaction--sometimes stress related.  Don't scratch!  Try rubbing in some vaseline into the bumps--See a DR if no improvement within a week.

0e46a7720dc8cb4b81e2e64b078bb13faa	The "plastic" is either an Occlusal Stop or Lingual Stop.  The purpose of the placement is to prevent complete closure of your mouth/teeth so the ortho. brackets don't break off.  The "stop" is simply a resin or composite material that is light cured to insure a solid mass.  The removal of the material is by simple "chipping" off or by "grinding" off with a bur and dental hand piece.  A "shot" is not required for removal so don't worry.  The "benefit' of orthodontics (braces) always out weights the "cost" of the treatment process.|`|1a4w3q0Oaa	No, but i'm not too sure, I had braces for three months<br>  on 6 teeth, it doesn't hurt at all, there is just alot of pressure<br>  when he cuts the wire. <br>  I just don't like the smell when he scrapes off the glue, ew.<br>  But I would imagine the back teeth would feel a bit more pressure than the front.<br>  I wasn't scared at all. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|nDLTXhugaa	Certainly, i was so happy my braces were taken off the day of. taking them off shouldn't hurt, it takes a bit of time to scrap off the super-glue (not sure what its called), but you'll feel like your mouth is missing something.

Other warning signs of a potentially serious injury include persistent vomiting, seizures or a large bruise on the scalp. In general, a bruise on the front of the head is less dangerous than one on the side or back of the head.|`|VwpQTUBQaa	Go see the Dr.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Suprised you didn't crack your head open--there is blood when you do that--<br>  <br>  I did this as a kid--only against a home heat radiator.

The diabetes only effects your baby if it's not under control.<br>  <br>  When I was diagnosed the doctors wanted to put me on diabetes medication or insulin.  But I refused and demanded they allow me to try and control it with diet first.  And I did.  It's difficult at first, but once you get used to it it's easy.<br>  <br>  You will need to go on a diet where you count your carbs.  Mine was 15 carbs for breakfast, 30 for lunch and dinner and 15 carbs for each snack.  You have a snack between each meal and one before bed.  They should send you to a nutritionist to set you up.<br>  <br>  You need to start exercising.  And you don't have to kill yourself ...

Please go back to your specialist today, or go get a second opinion today- can you see a specialist at the hospital perhaps? Persist until something starts working - she may require IV antibiotics. She is your baby and you need to make sure that something is done for her asap as she could get really sick from this.<br>  <br>  I hope everything will be ok soon for your baby.

La piel de gallina se produce por estímulos como el frío o una emoción. Entonces el músculo arrector se contrae y el pelo se eriza. Pero también se le llama así(piel de gallina) a la keratosis que es la acumulación de keratina en los folículos del vello en forma de protuberancias es decir, como forma de salpullido o ronchitas muy diminutas. Esto puede provocar problemas estéticos aunque no es da?ina para la salud.

FicyC2TXaa	No, you're not at increased risk of cancer.<br>  <br>  Hereditary cancer is rare - fewer than 10% of all cancer cases are hereditary.<br>  <br>  A sign that a cancer MAY be hereditary within a family is when several members of the same side of that family have had the SAME type of cancer, especially if some developed it at a younger than usual age.<br>  <br>  You don't inherit a general tendency to get cancer, and several family members having had different types of cancer isn't hereditary.<br>  <br>  And cancer that's diagnosed after the age of 50 is less likely to be hereditary.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Well, you don't have to worry about prostate cancer.

Talk to your doctor about these family issues so that he or she can educate you on steps to take to avoid things that can increase your chances of getting these diseases.<br>  <br>  You are very young so don't worry... but educate yourself about keeping healthy since you do have a family history.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	You have a history of these diseases, but there are things you can do. These things include a proper diet, maintain acceptable weight, exercise on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  Live a healthy life and you will maximize your life spam.
jr5EgB2Taa	I am only 28 but I have this issue too.  It is a result of poor genetics.  We have really bad circulation.  I exercise six days a week to help with the problem, but still there are days my toes are colder than the air outside!  Being diabetic does exasperate the condition.  <br>  Exercises, and warm towels wrapped around the extremities will help her a lot.  She is probably in a lot of pain.  You have nerve endings that can suffer damage after time.  It is nice of you to ask about her.  Take her a towel right out of the dryer and wrap her hands in it, and offer to take her for a walk.  Both will help a lot.

Hace falta mucha voluntad y paciencia pero con entrenamiento se pude y vale la pena...<br>  Lee acá...<br>  <br>   La eyaculacion precoz es la deficiencia de controlar el momento en que se produce la eyculación, o la prontitud de esta al practicar el coito, por lo que este termina rápidamente, muchas veces sin que la pareja haya logrado alcanzar el orgasmo.<br>  <br>  En algunos muy pocos casos suele producirse un dolor he inflamación en los testículos que se resuelve rápidamente echándole mano a la obra. Para retener la eyaculacion sin riesgo y sin que se convierta en un impedimento para sentir placer, se debe hacer un entrenamiento como este…<br>  Muchas veces lo de la eyaculación precoz es solo mental y las mayorías de las veces solo refleja un deseo inconsciente de terminar con la copula lo antes posible, bien por miedos reales o irreales pero siempre infundado en el inconsciente.<br>  Algunos de estos miedos pueden ser por ejemplo:<br>  A ser descubierto en el acto.<br>  A ser rechazado por la pareja durante el acto.<br>  A que aparezca otro hombre y lo desplace a uno durante el acto.<br>  Esto suena muy irrisorio, pero el inconsciente de uno suele ser muy machista y actúa como cualquier otro individuo macho de cualquier otra especie.<br>  O simplemente porque realmente no se disfruta realmente del acto (por desamor o repulsión hacia la pareja), en cuyo caso el acto se realiza solo por necesidad física o compromiso… o por miedos.<br>  ?Como se combate?<br>  Ten una buena pareja, alguien a quien realmente quieras y de quien realmente te guste su personalidad.<br>  Tomate todo el tiempo que necesites. Organízate un par de retiros sexuales Ja Ja... ?Si igual que los espirituales pero sexuales!<br>  Si todo esto no te alcanza puedes probar con una buena taza de te de tilo y una buena limonada. Tómatelo un rato antes del acto claro. El tilo te relaja mentalmente y el limón te reducirá la presión arterial y esto reducirá la excitación del momento. También el alcohol sin excesos es un buen psicorelajante y retrasador de la eyaculación<br>  Ahora si queres convertir el sexo en una experiencia espiritual as lo siguiente. Has la copula de forma lenta con diez penetraciones leves y poco profundas, solo tócale la puerta y luego una bien fuerte y profunda, de esas en que le entras hasta el fondo he, luego sigues con otras diez suaves y otra profunda y así hasta... bueno averiguado por vos mismo.<br>  Ja Ja te aseguro que el te van a rogar e implorar desesperadamente que le produzcas un orgasmo y lo mejor es que cuando domines esta técnica podrás controlar y retener la eyaculación extender el coito todo lo que quieras, e inclusive podrás tener tu mismo orgasmos de los mas intensos sin siquiera eyacular, por lo que podrás volver al ataque en cuanto tu pareja recupere el aliento.

She goes on to say that HIV/AIDS is spread from one person to another, which by definition makes it a disease, not a syndrome. She also accuses me of downplaying HIV/AIDS and pretending like its "no big deal"<br>  <br>  Allow me to defend myself.  I DID NOT say that HIV/AIDS<br>  was not a disease, I said AIDS was not a disease, but a syndrome, Accuquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, AIDS.  You don't "catch" AIDS, you accuquire it by being infected with HIV.  Some people are infected with HIV but don't develope AIDS.  We are splitting hairs here because a "syndrome" is a group of health problems that do, in fact, make up a disease.<br>  <br>  Cassie T has not been around to read too many of my posts.  So if I give the impression of treating AIDS like its "no big deal", let me make it perfectly clear:  that is NOT my intention.  I am a gay man and have dealt with so many of my friends dying that the mind just can't deal with it.  I have watched two partners, one of 5 years, and one of 12 years die from complications arising from AIDS.  Rick died on Christmas Eve of 2007, and I'm still coming to grips with the utter emptyness in my life.  To say that I'm downplaying AIDS is like a slap in the face right now.<br>  <br>  She says in her answer that we are on the verge of a cure  and that AIDS is contained in developed countries.  For this answer I'll give her a "thumbs down".  A cure?  Show me anything that suggests that.  Also, show me something that suggests that the spread of HIV is "contained".  Talk about downplaying! <br>  <br>  By mistake I gave Cassie T a thumbs up, instead of a thumbs down. <br>  <br>  My intention was to encourage testing for HIV, because if it is caugt in time many people do live a near normal life.<br>  <br>  Get tested.|`|LrGmpacOaa	No. We're on the verge of a cure, and it is fairly contained in developed nations.<br>  <br>  Africa is going to suffer a decimation similar to the Black Plague of Europe, though. We really need to get more humanitarian aid over there.

GMgsaFFBaa	Dissociative Disorders are a category of disorders that all share some common features-namely a form of the defense mechanism of dissocation which ranges in severity from feelings of detachment and estrangement from others (as in Depersonalization Disorder) to separate or alter states of personality within an individual person such that these alters show distincltly different ways of relating to and perceiving the world and are consciously unaware of one another as in DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder-formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder). Another dissociative disorder is Amnestic Fugue, where a person assumes a completely new identity and is amnestic for their previous history and sense of self and usually they move away and begin an entirely new life. A case can also be made for the fact that dissociative elements are part of most eating disorders, PTSD and Somatoform Disorders as all show varying degrees of disconnectedness from the self.<br>  <br>  The following is from one of my previous posts on Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and illustrates the symptoms commonly found in that disorder as well as symptoms often seen to a lesser degree in other types of dissociative disorders.<br>  <br>  DID is the existence of two or more separate personalities or personality states within one person, with each alter having distinctly different ways of thinking, feeling, behaving and relating to the world and distinctly different memories, each part having amnesia for the other parts' memories. It is born from repeated and severe abuse and involves the defense mechanism of dissociation and generally develops before the age of 10 as children are far more likely to dissociate. <br>  DID is often misdiagnosed and it is very common for a person to have had multiple different psychiatric diagnoses before it is definitively identified as DID. The symptoms frequently overlap with symptoms of schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Anxiety Disorders (all), PTSD, other Dissociative Disorders and Somatoform Disorders as well as Borderline Personality. It requires extremely careful assessment and a high level of trust by the patient before alters reveal themselves. The diagnosis cannot be finalized before a therapist has actually made contact with another alter and observed the switch between alters.<br>  The hallmark symptom is amnesia, which can be partial or complete depending on the level co-consciousness that exists between alters. Folks with the disorder describe the amnesia as "missing time" or blank periods, often daily or weekly, where they cannot account for their whereabouts or behavior. It is this amnesic barrier between parts that often leads to the most bizarre and distinctive signs and symptoms: not recognizing familiar people; not remembering highly significant events in their lives (like the birth of their first child, for example); finding purchases or articles of clothing/possessions, writings or drawings that they have no recollection of having bought or created. They are frequently accused of lying because they disavow their own behavior which is remembered by one part, while the amnestic part is completely unaware of it. Other unusual symptoms include: an exceptionally high tolerance for physical pain (they split off physical sensation which becomes encapsulated in one or several alters without others feeling it); not recognizing themselves in a mirror; using different names; having dramatically different skills and abilities that seem to be alternately present and then vanish (one alter may be able to drive a car while the sudden emergence of a child alter results in complete loss of this ability until the adult alter re-emerges); completely different opinions and behaviors (leading to the mislabelling of Bipolar or Borderline Personality.<br>  Often communication across between separate alters takes place in the form of hearing voices, hence these folks frequently get misdiagnosed as schizophrenic. The key distinction here is whether the voices are experienced as coming from inside the person's head (DID) or outside one's head (Schizophrenia/Bipolar Disorder). <br>  The separate identities develop in response to traumatic experiences which the child is unable to integrate and so they become "split off" from awareness and begin to take on a life of their own. <br>  Folks with DID often self-injure, frequently a result of internal battles between persecutor alters and weaker alters and there are continual battles for control of the body and "time out" in the body between competing alters. <br>  Symptoms of depression and anxiety are frequent and common and the picture is further complicated by the fact that one alter can meet all clinical criteria for Depression, while another part experiences no symptoms whatsoever. One part can be psychotic and experience no side effects from meds while another non-psychotic part has all the side effects and will stop taking meds.You can imagine that attempting to medicate such a disorder becomes an absolute nightmare.<br>  Other symptoms include flashbacks and nightmares, hence the confusion with PTSD. Sometimes there are fugue states and clients will switch and "come to" in the body and have no idea how they arrived in the situation they are in, not know the people they are with and be completely disoriented. I had one client call me from another state after being away for a few days and having no idea how she got there or how to get home. Depersonalization and trance states are common and hence the overlap with other Dissociative disorders.<br>  Folks with DID frequently experience multiple somatic symptoms for which there is no organic basis. They experience partial body memories of abuse without the actual memory of the event and thus exhibit strange physiological symptoms and are often labelled as Somatoform disorders or hypochondriacs. <br>  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that virtually any symptom of any disorder can be found at some point in a person with DID. Treatment is almost exclusively through psychotherapy as medication is merely palliative and an adjunct during periods of acute anxiety or depression. Treatment aims at initially contracting against suicidal and self-destructive behavior and attempts to establish safety first. Many DID folks enter treatment in horrendous circumstances where they are frequently in highly abusive relationships or are themselves abusive. Given the multiple alters, they may be both victim and perpetrator both within themselves alone and in the context of their relationships. The second primary goal is establishing communication and negotiation among alters to decrease amnesia and contradictory, self-defeating behavior. Ultimately the goal becomes integration of alters into one cohesive whole which involves sharing of memories and feelings across alters and a merging, where all parts continue to be present, but constant.|`|9jHhw9F1aa	Dissociative Disorder is actually the new terminology in reference to Multiple Personality Disorder. So basically it is called Dissociative Identity Disorder. They do not use the term Multiple Personalities anymore.<br>  <br>  Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a controversial diagnosis described in the DSM IV, as the existence in an individual of two or more distinct identities or personalities, each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment. At least two of these personalities are considered to routinely take control of the individual's behavior, and there is also some associated memory loss which is beyond normal forgetfulness. This memory loss is often referred to as "losing time" or amnesia. The symptoms must occur independently from substance abuse or a more general medical condition in order to be diagnosed.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociativ...</a>|`|d228be98bdd441ac03141cadaaca3ff0aa	wikipedia will know

Para quedar embarazada solo necesitas que haya un espermatozoide vivo que llegue al ovulo. Hay casos donde incluso no hubo penetracion propiamente dicha, si no que hubo un cierto jugeteo en el que se fricciona el pene con la entrada a la vagina sin que este entre mas alla, sin embargo los liquidos que se secretan antes del orgazmo tienen espermatozoides en ellos.<br>  <br>  Ahora, si tu pareja ejaculo dentro de ti, pues las posibilidades son aun mayores. Si bien el que tengas un orgasmo ayuda, puesto que las contracciones ayudan al semen a subir a la cabidad uterina, no es necesario que eso suceda para fecundar.<br>  <br>  Espero que no quedes embarazada en tu primera relacion (empezar la vida sexual ya es lo suficientemente tenso como para anhadir un embarazo), pero ademas, apartir de ahora, te tengo dos consejos: Uno, USA CONDON o cualquier otro metodo que te venga en gana, pero ejerce tu sexualidad de forma responsable. Dos, explora y busca como satisfacerte a ti misma en una relacion. La verdad es que me parece todo el mundo deberia buscar en sus relaciones tanto satisfacer a su pareja como satisfacerse a si mismo.<br>  <br>  Por ultimo, usualmente el primer dia del ciclo se cuenta como el dia que te vino la regla, y apartir de alli, los dias MAS fertiles son del 8 al 19, eso no quiere decir que los otros sean infertiles, solo que la probabilidad de embarazo es relativamente menor.<br>  <br>  Suerte.

All the best.|`|rZeoJXqsaa	I'm guessing that your dermatologist prescribe you creams for acne. So its either differin or Retin-A or something else. The problem with these creams are they have a dry effect on the skin so they probably work best on people with oily skin. However since you have sensitive skin, it doesn't mean you can't use them. First off, apply them only at areas with acne, areas that are free of acne don't apply. Secondly, if it is really drying use it once a day only especially Retin-A best used at night. Thirdly if is still drying, stop immediately and call up your dermatologist and see if you can get him/her to switch to a lower concentration.<br>  <br>  Also while using those creams you need to wash your face twice a day as well. I suggest a mild cleanser eg: cetaphil gentle cleanser. Yes you can put lotion as well but make sure it is also mild and most importantly OIL-FREE.

AA11618907	No hay “cura” para la infección por VPH, aunque en la mayoría de las mujeres la infección desaparece por sí sola. Los tratamientos administrados buscan atender los cambios en la piel o en la membrana mucosa causados por la infección por VPH, como verrugas y cambios precancerosos en el cuello uterino.<br>  Estas páginas que te envío contienen información seria sobre esta enfermedad.|`|gDLeO1C3aa	eso le pasa o casi todos los hombres pero es temporal, eso tambien depende de que tan grave sea la infección, suerte|`|ca32dfff1b4d21f48a3e106cde709a21aa	no se quita por que no hay cura|`|0efe07176d4b0befd42d1e062db02a58aa	No, exactamente porque es un virus. Los virus una vez que entran en un organismo vivo lo infectan para siempre, es decir, de por vida. Se pueden tratar las manifestaciones clínicas visibles, como las verrugas; pero el virus permanece en el organismo de por vida y los síntomas suelen reaparecer periodicamente.|`|FQS0H8hvaa	Hasta ahora no hay cura para el VPH, solamente es posible controlar la enfermedad, que dicho sea de paso, es altamente contagiosa|`|cOX2ZuYbaa	No|`|ohMOHuKFaa	En mujeres jóvenes la frecuencia de infección con el virus de papiloma humano es muy alta: hasta un 50% de las mujeres adolescentes y adultas jóvenes adquieren la infección por el virus del papiloma humano en los primeros 4-5 a?os de tener una vida sexual activa. De estas mujeres hasta un 25% de las que se infectan por VPH desarrollan lesiones escamosas epiteliales de bajo grado (LSIL). No obstante, en estas mujeres jóvenes el 90-95% de las infecciones curan solas, sin ningún tratamiento.5 <br>  <br>  En mujeres jóvenes sexualmente activas la frecuencia de la infección por el VPH es tan alta que una persona puede infectarse, curarse de la infección y volverse a infectar por un nuevo tipo de VPH, que a su vez cura espontáneamente después de algún tiempo.<br>  <br>  En un estudio que en la actualidad se esta realizando en Guanacaste, Costa Rica, para evaluar una vacuna contra el virus del papiloma humano, se encontró que un 26.4% de las 7234 mujeres participantes en el estudio tenían infecciones por VPH; un 18% de las mujeres estudiadas se encontraban infectadas por solo un tipo de virus de papiloma humano y un 8.2% se encontraban infectadas por al menos dos tipo de VPH. <br>  <br>  Un 24.4% de las mujeres menores de 25 a?os de este estudio se encontraban infectadas con virus VPH oncogénicos (alto riesgo de producir cáncer). La frecuencia de infección con virus oncogénicos en las mujeres de 35 a 44 a?os fue de un 9,7%; en las mujeres de 45-54 a?os fue de 9.8% y en las mujeres de 65 a?os y más la frecuencia de infección fue de 12.6%. <br>  <br>  En este estudio el VPH 16 fue el virus de alto riesgo que se encontró con mayor frecuencia (3.6% de la población estudiada). Por su parte, los tipos 16, 58, 18 y 31 fueron los tipos de VPH que se encontraron con más frecuencia en las mujeres diagnosticadas con NIC 3 y cáncer. 6<br>  <br>  En el mundo la mayor frecuencia de virus de papiloma humano de alto riesgo se encuentran en áfrica y América Latina (los virus más frecuentes son VPH 16, 18, 31, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 y 58) De éstos el más frecuente en América Latina es el VPH-16. En Centroamérica y Suramérica también son frecuentes los virus de alto riesgo VPH-33, VPH-39 y VPH-59.|`|2fYYAcSfaa	No se quita porque es un tipo de virus que persiste en el organismo, lo que se puede tratar son algunos de los problemas que provoca como las verrugas genitales, que se quitan con tratamiento local, aplicacion de medicamentos e inmunomoduladores, pero aun asi puede reaparecer. es un virus que alterna periodos de inactividad con periodos de latencia, aunque una vez que se contrae no se va mas.|`|4e4886278a9b39aaba8ed4c35db72482aa	No, como sucede con la mayoria de los virus no se curan, mas bien diria no se eliminan por completo del cuerpo y permanecen en estado latente para otra invasion cuando las defenzas del cuerpo estan debilitadas. La mayoria de los virus se aloja despues de una infeccion en las glandulas y nudos linfaticos en espera de otra oportunidad para volver a atacar. Los virus que tienen este esquema son el VPH el VIH, los herpes tanto genital como labial, la gripe y un sinnumero de virus mas. La mejor prevencion para otro ataque es mantener un estado de salud general comiendo adecuadamente, durmiendo lo suficiente y sobre todo evitar el estress a toda costa.|`|d2729b79459c059fc0a3a4fd09dfc239aa	Desafortunadamente la infección permanece latente de por vida, así que no es curable, lo que se puede hacer es en el caso que sea el virus de papiloma encontrado en un estudio de papanicolau o colposcopia se puede realizar algunos procedimientos médicos como criocirugía o conificación, ya que en este caso se considera al VPH como precancerígeno para cáncer de cuello uterino.<br>  El virus de papiloma tiene muchas variedades (alrededor de 100 conocidas) de las cuales el 14, 16, 18 se han relacionado más con cáncer, las otras producen verrugas o nada. <br>  Para más información puedes consultarme.|`|wIKHkcONaa	no,  pero necesitas  controlmédico para manterner el virus controlado.|`|zMoOyM66aa	UNA VES CONTRAIDO NO SE ELIMINA<br>  PERO CON CONTROL MEDICO<br>  NO LLEGA LEJOS.<br>  <br>  HASTE VER POR UN MEDICO.<br>  <br>  AHORA LOS HAY Y MUY BUENOS.

9pLdhuBnaa	Sometimes feet can hurt because of having a hard time trying to adjust to the shoes especially if the size is too small.<br>  <br>  In order to have a stool to sit you would need to talk to your doctor about this issue and have them evaluate further to see if something else is going on with your feet.  I would also recommend a consultation with a foot specialist called a Podiatrist.  They can help you try to figure out what's going on and see if you need more specialized kinds of inserts than the ones made by Dr. Scholls.

Do you have super strength?   No, its just that you  tapped with more of your strength than you thought you did.<br>  <br>  When we are angry, we get an adrenaline rush that makes us do things harder than we think we do.  There are many documented feats of amazing strength brought on by this physical anomaly.  <br>  <br>  But this is MY question.  Do you have an anger management problem?  It seems you might if you can send a plate of food all over a wall.  Best to learn how to deal with that soon.  <br>  <br>  You cannot go around flinging food because you are angry....you sure don't want to advance from plates to pots to silverware to knives do you?  <br>  <br>  Seriously,  learn some control.  No matter how hard it is.

AA11987492	I have the ParaGard and I *LOVE* it. It is an IUD that is hormone free (it is probably the hormones that she is having a problem with), so you don't get all of those nasty side effects. There is no upkeep to it outside of checking to be sure you can feel the strings once a month. That means no pill to remember, no ring to go have put in every month, no shot every three months, nothing. It last for ten years and when you want to have kids, all you do is go have it removed. Your fertility should return that night, as there are no hormones that have to leave your body. Some people do experience heavier periods with it. I had a heavy period for the first 3 months, but now they are back to normal. To be honest, I just wore an ultra tampon instead of a regular one, it was no big deal.<br>  <br>  You could also try some spearmacide foams|`|K5uoaetaaa	Nuvaring, IUD.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Doesn't everybody!<br>  <br>  Today's Sponge is back on the Market.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Oral or the ever risky "pull out" method.Good luck  and have a nice day.|`|20af19563193d6f76a6c7f153bd57eb9aa	You can use a contraceptive gel.  It isn't as effective as condoms, about 94% rather than 97%.   All the woman does is insert what looks like a tampon applicator and release the gel.  It is a spermicide, so it will kill the sperm the moment it enters the vagina.  I use it all the time, and I haven't been pregnant yet!|`|9A2qByAUaa	Relax.

Cervical caps and diaphragms in particular are very unsafe compared to condoms; however, if you use them in tandem with the calendar method you may be less likely to conceive.<br>  <br>  If you hate condoms and she can't use ANY form of birth control, then don't have sex, plain and simple.<br>  Either that, or get sterilized.|`|c7ee727afb26df28f827deb57db1035eaa	spermacide. which I know nothing about.<br>  or that plastic thing she puts in there that prevents pregnancy for 5 years. it was advertised on tv. or you could just be extremely careful. no leaks or anything! <br>  whats wrong with condoms anyway?<br>  O_o  cheEto|`|86CRoXKzaa	well the safe way for you guys to work this out is to figure out what time of the month she comes on and then predict when you can do it|`|XqcmZ7cDaa	I hope you are married.<br>  <br>  J, I am so glad your mother didn't decide to abort you so you can tell other people to kill their babies.|`|6HkDVYcAaa	You could try and IUD or what about the birth control shot?

AUOp1j5Saa	Bleeding is a very common side effect of Plan B.<br>  What you experienced is known as progesterone withdrawal bleeding and completely normal. <br>  The last time you took plan B you probably took it later in your cycle, which is why you didn't bleed.<br>  Your next period probably won't come when it is due and could occur in a week or not for a couple months.<br>  Take a pregnancy test when your period is due though, just to make sure.<br>  Once you have a negative test, start your bcps again.
lZEDUmI6aa	Actually your age is a big factor when it comes to how long it takes bones to heal.  If you are under 20 or so, should be no more than a week or 2.  From 20 to about 35, more like 31/2 to 4 weeks, and over 40 more like 6 weeks.  The pain level should subside in a few days, whatever your age.  Make sure you eat well to help your body heal, and hope you feel better soon.|`|2NtwlyO2aa	about 7 to 10 days
