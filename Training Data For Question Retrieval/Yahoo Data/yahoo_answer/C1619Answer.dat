OZLBNzvGaa	Yo conozco Estambul, es bellisimo, pero sólo para visitar y turistear. La vida es muy barata, hay mucho tráfico, entre el bósforo, sus palacios y mezquitas te puedes pasar unos días increíbles. Mas de eso, a vivir ya ahi, no creo que sea buena opción. Casi no ves mujeres en las calles, sólo hombres fumando y caminando agarrados de la mano (allá es normal). Eso si, ves a muchos "perreando" a las turistas, muchos son bien parecidos ...<br>  La verdad no se me antojaría vivir allí.

There are a lot of day hikers and overnighters.  In the Amicalola State Park there is The Len Foote Hike Inn. I have not been to the Inn, but the Lodge is fantastic and the cabins are real nice too.

fa5a4669490fdc047835e196cc82aefdaa	On l'aime ou on la kif la culture portugaise !<br>  <br>  Le Portugal est un pays qui a toujours été tourné vers la mer, cela se ressent dans la culture portugaise : la nourriture bien s?r mais aussi en architecture (un bon exemple est le style Manuelin -cf Mosteiro dos Jeronimos, Torre de Belem- qui reprend le thème de la mer au travers des cordages par exemple qui orne les fa?ades...). Au niveau de la musique, qui ne connait pas le Fado et Amalia Rodrigues ?! La culture portugaise est aussi très métissée (Brésil, Cap Vert, Angola, Mozambique...) et on retrouve cette culture dans la musique de Cesaria Evora (cap-verdienne mais lusophone...)...<br>  Le portugais est aussi très passionné, il est assez extrême dans tout ce qu'il entreprend mais toujours avec respect des autres, certes il est "sanguin" mais il a également le c?ur sur la main...<br>  Ceux qui critiquent les portugais ne les connaissent pas vraiment en fait...|`|tYcGBGLhaa	Vraiment beaucoup !<br>  Il faut dire que cette culture s'exporte peu et je l'ai découverte en fréquentant des portugais.|`|r7f00rc8aa	oui et aussi celle   des espagnoles ,et  des  pays asiatiques<br>   qui sont riche eux aussi en culture ,|`|1dfe72d522379b66b86dedab429b7818aa	oui, c'est sincère et baser sur de bonnes valeurs ...|`|DydsW5L0aa	j'adore!!! c'est pour sa que je vis o portugal depuis 7 mois!!!<br>  <br>  bizz

Jso4seaVaa	I have lived in the Phoenix area for about 8 years now and I am still alive believe it or not!? I am just kidding and I think you are being a little paranoid about moving here.? I do understand though because I am not a big fan of scorpions either.? I have only found one in my house in that 8 years but I do own a couple rental homes that have had more in them.? They can be treated with insecticides, sealing up homes, and getting rid of their food source.? They do seem to be found more around the hillsides and construction areas but can end up anywhere.? The only down side is that some of them are bark scorpions which are more poisionous but a sting from any other kind I heard feels simply like a bee sting.? My bug guy said that a black widow bite is a lot worse than a bark scorpion sting but I don't want to find out which is worse.? As far as death from either one of those you wouldn't have to worry about unless you are extremely allergic to the sting or bite.? They do have clinics here that have anti-venom for the bark scoprion but they rarely even use it since it usually heals on its own.? Anyway, I feel like I may be making you more paranoid but the point is I rarely come across a scorpion and have killed a couple balck widows all outside.<br>  <br>  As far as moonsoons and microbursts I wouldn't worry too much about them either.? Moonsoon usually just look kind scary because they cause dust storms.? But at the end of it it just pisses me off because I have to dust my house more.? Microburts can happen pretty much anywhere and those are more likely to cause a roof to have damage.? But none have ever hit my house.? If you are really worried about it come for a visit I see for yourself that those things are really no big deal.? Hey there are about 3 million people around this area so it can't be too dangerous right?<br>  <br>  UPDATE- Go figure later tonight I went into my computer room and was confronted by a scorpion.? It was just chilling on the carpet and I was bare foot at the time.? Two minutes later I came back with size 13's on (after checking them cause now I got a little paranoid) and squoosh no more scorpion.? So that is two I have found in this house in about a year and a half (my previous homes I had none.)|`|Jy0r81mdaa	Have not seen a scorpion in 8 years.<br>  But, I do not climb palm trees.<br>  Rain is nothing here.<br>  We have 2 months of maybe rain and that is about it.|`|4ccfa336e8d721730deaa2e0cdead710aa	Want to stay away from them, don't climb trees out in the middle of the desert and have your house sprayed. The storms are dangerous. You can have a storm produce 90 mile an hour winds but it is rare. Micro bursts happen with every storm it is when the storm falls apart and the wind is then pushed out away from the storm. If you are the afraid then maybe you should stay where you are.|`|wAl9knNzaa	I have lived in Phoenix for 21 years and have only ever seen a scorpion one time, that was in a friend's backyard, and she lived next to an empty lot.  Scorpions are more prolific the further into the desert you go, so if you buy a home in the desert expect to see them, if you live in town typically the only draw would be palm trees, don't buy a house with palm trees.<br>  <br>  I enjoy the monsoon.  People think of the monsoon as a big storm like a typhoon or something but monsoon really just refers to a weather pattern.  Our weather pattern monsoon brings humidity and yes storms, but typically they are dust storms (nothing huge) just dirt,  dust devils and wind.  Sometimes it rains, and other times we get huge electrical storms. <br>  <br>  I have lived through one major microburst, but I came from a part of the country where we dealt with tornados for the whole summer, several each summer, so one major microburst on my side of town in a 21 year period is not that much.  <br>  <br>  We don't usually have "severe" weather, we just have weather, and mostly it's HOT.|`|pS4e5OtZaa	I moved from Seattle to Phoenix and stayed 3 years a (long) while back.<br>  <br>  During my 3 years, I did not see a single scorpion. I didn't look. The urban legend in Arizona is not to leave your shoes outside - lest one of the critters climbs in during the night. <br>  <br>  I saw plenty of black widow spiders. Those you can see in a tangle of web in corners of buildings. Wear gloves.<br>  <br>  Monsoons in Phoenix are an experience. When I was there their infrastructure wasn't equipped to handle the deluge of water. When the rains came the puddles were enormous. Also, they didn't use reflective paint on the roads so at night, when it's dark and raining like mad, you couldn't see the lines in the roads. I'm sure they've figured out both issues (including the mystery of the "left turn lane"). The electrical storms are out of this world compared to what you see in the PNW.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind a lot of old people move to Phoenix and they do just fine. We're not talking about a place where you need mosquito netting and a 12 gage by the door.<br>  <br>  Oh... Ripping the roof off... That's kind of true. It was a large Gila Monster with a platoon of scorpions on it's back. This hasn't happened since the city imported Rodan from the Japanese in 1966.|`|050c037f4fac7429f0953c6a001aec77aa	I've lived here my entire life (35+ years) and have only seen a handful of scorpions.  I never wear shoes either.  Our monsoons are awesome.  The worst damage that has ever happened to me was about 20 years ago the street behind my house flooded & broke our back fence.  Our backyard flooded but there wasn't any damage to the rest of the house.  Winds can be a concern.  Make sure you have homeowners insurance.|`|BP6nS9F5aa	I have been in Phoenix for six years.I have only seen a scorpion once.it was on the mountain in the desert.You would be more likely to find them in a newer community's,outskirts of Phoenix.I have never seen a scorpion in my house.And i don't  ever put shoes on when i get up at night.<br>  I love monsoons!!!!It usually happens in the evening.Lots of lightning,its beautiful!Its as dangerous as lightning anywhere else.It is possible for a roof to get damaged of high winds,but that is not very often.it is not that bad.That is my favorite part of the year.If those are only concerns for you not to move to Phoenix,i think you should stop worrying.Worry more about  crime.And also people are different  then where you come from.And not in a good way.Lots of trash here(people)i used to live in Seattle and people where much nicer there.I am sure its similar in Portland.God luck on whatever you decide to do!

wMxJDXcRaa	The Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone initially coalesced as a group of Sierra Leoneans which led National Patriotic Front of Liberia elements across the border in an attempt to replicate Charles Taylor's earlier success in toppling the Liberian government.<br>  When it was first formed, the RUF put forward the slogan, "No More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People."  While its goal was clearly to overthrow the government of Sierra Leone, the RUF gave little indication of what sort of government would replace it. The group did not advocate Marxism or any similar leftist ideology, nor did it advocate extreme nationalism or Fascism. It also did not claim to be a force fighting for a certain ethnic group or region. At one point, during ongoing peace negotiations in 1995, RUF published a pamphlet entitled "Footpaths to Democracy: Toward a New Sierra Leone", which contained some rhetoric references to social justice and pan-Africanism.<br>  The RUF was created by Foday Sankoh, of Temne and Lokko background, and two allies, Abu Kanu and Rashid Mansaray, with substantial assistance from Charles Taylor of Liberia. At first, the RUF was popular with Sierra Leoneans, many of whom resented a Freetown elite seen as corrupt and looked forward to promised free education and health care and equitable sharing of diamond revenues. However, the RUF developed a reputation internationally for enormous cruelty during its decade-long struggle.<br>  Foday Sankoh did not stand by his earlier promises of equitably sharing of diamond revenues and used these funds to buy arms for Charles Taylor and himself. With the diamond mines under the control of the rebel group, the RUF became singularly focused on protecting its resource base. Sierra Leone's economy collapsed, with ordinary citizens trapped between the cruelty of RUF troops and starvation. After a coup by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in 1997, the RUF and AFRC created a joint junta to control the country before being evicted from the capital by the invasion of a Nigerian-led West African force that reinstated the rule of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The war is estimated to have cost the lives of 200,000 people.<br>  There were many child soldiers in the RUF, up to 23,000 at one point. Most were used for attacks on villages and on guard duty at diamond fields. Today, about 20,000 are still left serving in the military of Sierra Leone.The RUF made extensive use of child soldiers, using horrific methods to numb their new recruits to barbarity. Thousands of abducted boys and girls were forced to serve as soldiers or as prostitutes,  and those chosen to be fighters were sometimes forced to murder their parents. Guerrillas frequently carved the initials "RUF" on their chests,  and officers reportedly rubbed cocaine into open cuts on their troops to make them maniacal and fearless. For entertainment, some soldiers would bet on the sex of an unborn baby and then slice open a woman's womb to determine the winner.<br>  The RUF was notorious for severing the limbs of those victims it did not murder, particularly children. In response to the immediate execution of rebels by government forces, the RUF instead instituted a policy of cutting off the hands of captured soldiers with the intent of sending the message, "You don't hold your weapon against your brother."  Brandishing machetes, RUF rebels amputated the hands, arms, and legs of tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans. The RUF indicated that the reason for these actions was that amputees could no longer mine diamonds, which might be used to support government troops. The election slogan at that time was that the people 'had power in their hands', so the RUF would hack the hands off to prevent voting. RUF members are also said to have practiced cannibalism.The government set up a refugee camp where they gathered amputees; the camp was situated next to the international hotels. They also helped fund the camps and gave them food and water.<br>

roQPtGccaa	Have you ever noticed that most of your dreams have something to do with events from the day before you went to sleep?<br>  <br>  When we sleep at night our bodies rejuvenate and refresh.<br>  <br>  The subconscious mind picks up millions of images everyday and sorts and separates them into files much like a computer. Some of those images are duplicates and need to be discarded and that is what happens when we sleep. <br>  <br>  While your subconscious mind is sorting them out your sleeping conscious mind tries to make sense out of your subconscious minds interpretations and we get pictures in our minds during that process. Unfortunately sometimes the stories that are produced from those pictures get intertwined by our imaginations.<br>  <br>  So say you are walking along and see dog poop and later in the day you see or think about food and those pictures get mixed up as they get sorted out. Hence you end up eating it.<br>  <br>  Your subconscious mind sends unwanted information to your conscious mind for elimination.<br>  <br>  That is why I think of dreaming as the subconscious mind taking a dump in the middle of the night to get rid of  all waste that your mind no longer needs so that you can start fresh in the morning.|`|bc90d3436efbea8f66920f38197e4eecaa	i read in a readers digest that dreams are something u want to happen or ur scared it will happen|`|48WkXo1Taa	You can get a book that tells you what your dreams mean..|`|5H8kjwHDaa	Wow this is classic dream of someone who is gay and in the closet.

To eat means to take in<br>  something.  You eating dog's poop can mean that you can swallow<br>  in your friend's nasty remarks or take in something bad that he has done to you.|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	In your past life you are a dog.

While you're there walk further up the hill to San Miniato al Monte; the church has some very good frescos and there's a small shop run by the monks. The small cemetery there offers some good photo ops of the Duomo in the background of some interesting sculpture. Walk through the rose garden on the way back down to the city. The Orsanmichele is also worth a visit. <br>  <br>  There's a big arts & crafts show at the Fortezza da Basso at the end of April and early May every year with over 700 exhibitors. <br>  <br>  The Oltrarno neighborhood is interesting - it's a very old area where there are  palazzi of the wealthy people from several hundred years ago.

cYuDUKNMaa	If you have time the cheapest helicopter flight is on I drive.  Its a red helicopter on the left as you go north next to a model train exibtion and about a mile after the interchange with the worlds largest macdonalds on the left.<br>  <br>  If yor on a budget, take breakfast in Ponderosa, all you can eat for $4.  plus your drink of choice. <br>  <br>  Dont bother with the Florida mall, go to the outlet centres instead, even the people who work in Florida mall go there for shopping as its FAR cheaper.<br>  <br>  Take the effort to get your selves across to Gatorland.  In June due to the heat the gators will be quite activeand so the shows are even better then. It takes a good 5 - 6hrs to do so your whole day is not lost there.  I would tie that in with a shopping day, as you wont spend a whole day shopping either. <br>  <br>  Get a sat nav if you are driving as although things are quite easy to find, you dont want to spend what little time you have (as you will struggle to see all of it in two weeks since there is SO much) trying to find things.<br>  <br>  Dont bother with Arabian Nights show if you care about cruelty to animals, we walked out if that one as the performers were more concearned about looking flashy and showing of than wether or not the animals were happy.<br>  <br>  Go to the steak house directly opposite wet and wild for a great big steak.  Good value for money and if your from the uk make sure you try these two restaurants as we dont have them here....    Crackerbarrel for great traditional American food nor burgers but proper American stuff.  Always a great atmosphere in there and also for drive through mexican at great prices try Taco bell.  I love Taco bell, could you bring me back a beef and potatoe burrito their only about $2 and could kill a small child if dropped from over 6 feet they are that stuffed.<br>  <br>  You will probably want to go back time and time again.  I have been four times and love it.<br>  <br>  Check out Walmart while you there if you get a chance its something to see in itself...<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.|`|0cca3418fa67ff9715340b29d328e8f9aa	Bring an Umbrella! it rains a lot in the summer months here in Orlando.

I LOVED it there! There's designer shops like Chanel, and also a Macys and Bloomingdales which are really good.<br>  <br>  I-Drive is a great location. There are attractions along that road that are worth a visit like Ripleys Believe It Or Not museum, and Wonderworks (the upside down house).<br>  <br>  Plenty of restaurants along there too like Tony Roma's, TGI Fridays, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze. At Universal Citywalk there are plenty of restaurants too, like Bubba Gumps. And also a cinema.

K01NU24saa	To be Fair to majority Race, Malaysia 70 % is Malay, Malay should be " Big Brother ". we cannot ask for the same Equality , even i am Malaysia Chinese ! personal i agree that . Sorry to Malaysia Indian and Chinese . but , Please think about .... Malaysian  Chinese position in Malaysia is better than Malay Muslim in Singapore , why type of Ministers Post Malay hold ? , and in Malaysia, we always allow 4 Chinese Ministers  and 5 State Ministers in the Government. only 22 % Chinese in Malaysia , but we have many Chinese school around, 70 % Singaporean is Chinese , not even one Chinese school since 1980 ! If your not agree about this, Thinks about... can other Race become China and Japan PM ? why ?. we ( Chinese ) should be happy, give a little way to Malay in Malaysia , Chinese still able to enjoy life . Singapore Chinese have to work till 90 year old, paid very high medical fees, do you like that ?|`|qcecsrDsaa	There is NO equality! The government is controlled  by prejudicial Malays!

The Indians are treated as 3rd class citizens and only allowed to do the dirty work.<br>  <br>  The Bumi-Putra and Muslim rules are very unfair and keep Malaysia down.Take a look at Singapore and see how a next door neighbor Nation (once apart of Malaysia) succeeds and thrives as it treats ALL with equality!<br>  <br>  Please correct me if you think I am wrong.|`|5e6836dfa778c1efeee10f87746767f4aa	i dare not comment becaue of ISA sorry no offense|`|0pUsMhQBaa	A very delicate one to comment as I might hurt some of my fellow Malay yammers.

uG8yLnUWaa	Unfortunately 7 days won't even get you out of Sydney or Melbourne! But if you really want to come, then do so! Pick one spot and see it well. If you like the city - I can recommend Sydney as there is lots to see and do and their public transport system means that you can keep the costs down. You have the Sydney Opera House, The Sydney harbour Bridge, Bondi Beach,The Blue Mountains, Manly, Taronga Zoo, Ferry rides around the harbour and up the river, Shopping so much to do!! If you want to see the Barrier reef - go there and do it properly. It sounds like to are probably gong to get here to Oz once, so do it well! One thing I can recommend about the Barrier Reef, while the big operators obviously have all the great equipment, they also go to places that are full of tourists (duhh!) I went out with a smaller company and went to a place on the reef where not many people go so it was quieter and we didn't keep snorkeling into people! Just make sure to use a reputable company!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, like I said. If you can afford a week - just do it!! Otherwise you may never get to see even a tiny bit of our great country!!!!|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Would it be cheaper for you to skip the vacation packages?  You don't say where you're coming from, but if it's from the States you also have to factor in a missing day somewhere along the way (crossing the date line).  And getting jet-lag is very likely!  I'd pick just one spot and concentrate on that.  <br>  <br>  If you chose Cairns for example, you could stay in a hostel and rent a car and 7 days would be enough time to go snorkelling on the reef, see the forests and waterfalls in the Atherton hinterland, go to Mission Beach, Port Douglas, Mosman Gorge, the Daintree Rainforest.  You could fit a huge amount in in 7 days if you wanted.  And you can easily get to those destinations and back in a day.<br>  <br>  If you chose Sydney you certainly wouldn't get bored in 7 days, there's galleries, museums, beaches, mountains, the harbour, shopping, China Town, Darling Harbour, the Harbour Bridge, Opera House, top restaurants, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  I'm not too familiar with Melbourne, but I'm sure 7 days wouldn't get boring there either!<br>  <br>  For such a limited time I'd probably pick Cairns for the variety of natural beauty in the area.|`|d2QVB6Qyaa	Australia is a huge country - a continent! You would need to choose just one area and visit that if you only have 7 days - Brisbane and either the Sunshine coast or Gold Coast. You can do trips up to the Glass House or Tambourine Mountains for variety.I prefer the Sunshine coast up near Noosa.Maloolaba is lovely.<br>  <br>  Or go to Sydney and just spend your week there. Take a trip up to the Blue Mountains. A ferry across to Manly Beach. Look around the Rocks, Botanical Gardens and Opera House. There are lovely beaches  - and plenty to do.<br>  <br>  Or Melbourne. Is a lovely city. Do a wine tour, visit some beaches, shopping and sightseeing in the central city.There are parks and gardens.You can take a tram and get on and off at different places.<br>  <br>  By the time you arrive and get to your hotel, and then leave you will find you have less than 8 days.But I still think it is worth going. You can see a lot in a week and it always seems longer if you are having fun and seeing a lot of new things.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	a total waste of money to come for a week,australia is huge<br>  <br>  you could spend a week in sydney alone,wait til you can afford a month|`|AA11100518	you can't do all that in 7 days.  i think the great barrier reef is the coolest think i ever saw.  i liked surfingon the gold coast too and<br>  swimming on that easternmost point, forgot its name.  you need to try to plan it out.  it's not like you can drive from sydney to cairns, you would have to fly, that would take most of a day right there.  and most of a day flying back to sidney.  i think if you are going for 7 days you need to plan what you can actually do.  there won't be any ayers rock or anything.  it just depends on what is most important for you to see.  we were there 2 weeks adn didn't get to sydney.l  just brisbane, gold coast and cairns.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	Honestly, I would wait until you can come for a longer period of time. Even 2 or 3 weeks is very little. <br>  <br>  Australia is a massive country, I don't think many people realise this. To get from Cairns (Great Barrier Reef) to Sydney is a 10 hour + drive, and from Sydney to Melbourne is another 10 hours. <br>  <br>  Personally to get a good view of Australia I would allow 10 - 14 days per city, i.e. Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and 7 - 10 days in Perth, 7 in Tasmania and Adelaide and a month to see inland Australia. But if you could spend 5 - 6 weeks to see the east coast, you'll get a good idea of the country.<br>  <br>  By all means you can still come to Australia but pick one city only for 8 days. I would probably lean towards Sydney or Melbourne because Queensland would involve quite a bit of travel to see all the sights. <br>  <br>  At the moment things aren't so expensive our dollar is only buying 66 cents US. My parents have just left for Hawaii and that is expensive, nearly $400 a night for accomodation that we wouldn't pay $200 for in Australia. <br>  <br>  Tours and vacations you are referring to will be expensive. The cheapest way is to book airfares online. Zuji do a good comparison. Book accomodation online, Accor is a good chain with different levels of accomodation to suite your budget with good locations in the big cities. I prefer Novotel and Mercure, or if you prefer an apartment (saves on buying breakfast) try Medina or Quest. Then do a couple of day tours, this will be so much cheaper, try and use public transport and jet around the city yourself. |`|h0O5BC2baa	You can probably see 2 or so city's in a week. I dont know what your into, if you like the city then do sydney and melbourne, if you want to scooba dive, see the great barrier reef, if you want to see more australian stuff, go to the mioddle which has airs rock.<br>  <br>  Maybe Newzealland would be a better place to go for a week to.|`|qzLYFzwwaa	personally my favorite parts were the great barrier reef and the rain forest  (up near cannes) we went on these tours in the rain forest and to like these habbitat things and i liked those much better than sydney|`|fHjYTBKSaa	it ain't enuf for you to cover australia. may be you can cover  sydney and melbourne|`|D89m7pwfaa	Australia has a larger land mass than the USA. 7 Days is nowehere near long enough. You can drive from Great barrier reef area to Melbourne, but it is around 2200km or 1300 miles, and you won't see much. Instead of booking everything through an agent, Only book your flights and the first nights accomodation. The great Barrier reef is expensive even in the off season. When you get here, you can start your own trips generally cheaper than what the travel agent does. We went to the US last year and loved it. We booked the flights only and a couple of nights accomodation and drove everywhere and had a ball. You will be better off planning your trip to Australia at home and starting it yourself. Have fun when you get here.

If you include them you'll spend a lot of your time travelling.  It's not impossible, flying and staying overnight at each destination, but I'd suggest you saw London, and "spread out" with perhaps two or three day-trips out from there, by train or coach. Windsor, Cambridge, Oxford, Canterbury, Brighton...  all are quite possible, travelling independently or as part of a guided tourist excursion.  <br>  Pick what interests you.<br>  Kew Gardens for plants, or Duxford Imperial War Museum at Cambridge for a massive collection of aircraft and military vehicles?<br>  <br>  The site below is not as pushy as some, just to give an idea of options, but on the whole there's little need to book in advance.|`|0bc16da7336d1bca831672a954fdc0deaa	London Weather stats for the year. . . .<br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003790" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_...</a><br>  <br>  |`|gqvF0sSzaa	Do you have any idea just how FAR APART those places are?

Instead rely on trains.  Here is a good itinerary:-<br>  <br>  Days 1 & 2: Arrival in London - see Westminster Abbey then stroll by the House of Parliament and that landmark clock of London, "Big Ben".<br>  Continue walking north along Whitehall, bypassing 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the prime minister, and ending at Trafalgar Square, the hub of London and its most famous square.<br>  <br>  On the north side of the square stands the National Gallery, then visit Covent Garden.  Then walk along The Mall all the way to Buckingham Palace. In the afternoon, do the Tower of London. .<br>  <br>  On Day 2, visit the British Museum. Then head to the City, the financial district of London lying in the East End. Head for St. Paul's Cathedral, the masterpiece of architect Sir Christopher Wren. Then Tate Modern and Westminster Bridge then London Eye, the world's largest observation wheel. <br>  <br>  Day 3: A Side Trip to Windsor Castle then Hyde Park Then Mayfair, Grosvenor Square, before window-shopping along Oxford Street or else New and Old Bond streets. .<br>  <br>  Days 4 & 5: Stratford-upon-Avon - From London's Paddington Station, you can be in Stratford-upon-Avon in just 2 hours. <br>  <br>  Day 6: Oxford & Its University - by train from London<br>  <br>  Day 7: Blenheim Palace & Hampton Court Palace - by train from London<br>  <br>  You could go to Scotland (Edinburgh) but it would be a huge rush and the weather up there would be awful unless its high summer.  Ireland would only be worth going to if you had 3 weeks in the UK.<br>  <br>  Have a great time.<br>  |`|lkUEHERhaa	Hey!

The highest demand is English teacher (but you don't want to be), foreign language translator (you need an university degree for that language or experience in translation), cuisine chef (French, Italian, or something non-Asian), IT professionals (e.g. able to design the entire web site for a bank), hardware engineers (e.g. understand the function of every peice of chip in a iPhone), civil engineer (design the new subway system), or you have an Master or PhD degree in law, internatonal trade, or something can benefit Taiwan to expand her international position.<br>  <br>  If you have any of these skills, you're not limited to work in Taiwan; actually you can find job in anywhere in the world.

I think the global list was Nigeria, the Philippines and Poland. <br>  <br>  Poland is 'conservative' from a clergyman's point of wiev - they think it's 'moral' to perform abortions under unsafe, illegal conditions, for instance. They do also have a pretty extensive welfare system, though, so probably Nigeria is a better choice - in the northern provinces they are starting to establish Sharia laws...

Esp. "when the going got rough", good music wrapped me in hope.  <br>  <br>  --Luther Vandross' CD "I Know" in its entirety.  <br>  <br>  --Pink's "Mr. President", esp. when the death toll of American troops was soaring.  The first time I heard it I cried and continued to cry almost for a full day straight, then continued to play it for days anyway.  <br>  <br>  --Brooks and Dun's "Believe".  I never got tired of hearing this.  I've played it for days, esp. after a dear friend died.  It kept me in tears, but it also got the tears out in a good way, it helped me grieve.  <br>  <br>  By the time I finally slowed down and stopped playing it, I not only felt healed to a degree, but I felt that the song truly honored him.  <br>  <br>  --Kenny Loggins:  Celebrate Me Home, Conviction of the Heart, For The First Time.  <br>  <br>  --Bonnie Raitt:  I Can't Make You Love Me--cried repeatedly over this one too; Nick of Time.   <br>  <br>  --Marlena Shaw's "Go Away Little Boy".  <br>  <br>  --Multiple choices on Jaheim's Still Ghetto CD.  <br>  <br>  Lord, don't get me started with Patti LaBelle, Barry White, Johnny Cash, Etta James, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill,....|`|9R8uYHcPaa	yes sometimes i can play one song for 5-6 hours ...|`|m1JxtSVSaa	all day..|`|hRnEf90Naa	Hmm...

At no time can the Male make such comments as "Insignificant" and "Is that all?" when the Female is complaining.<br>  <br>  17. If the Female has PMS, all The Rules are null and void<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Rules for Women:This is a list of rules that guys wished women knew...<br>  (In response to the popular "A Woman's 50 Rules for Men")<br>  1.

Anything we said 6 or 8 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.<br>  26. Christopher Columbus didn't need directions, and neither do we.<br>  27. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.<br>  28. Yes, pissing standing up is more difficult than peeing from point blank range. We're bound to miss sometimes.<br>  29. Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers.<br>  30. Don't fake it. We'd rather be ineffective than deceived.<br>  31. If you don't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br>  32. Let us ogle. If we don't look at other women, how can we know how pretty you are?<br>  33. Don't rub the lamp if you don't want the genie to come out.<br>  34. You can either ask us to do something OR tell us how you want it done-not both.<br>  35. Women wearing Wonder bras and low-cut blouses lose their right to complain about having their boobs stared at.<br>  36. Don't make 50 rules when 36 will do.

If you are paranoid to believe that everybody is out to kill the muslims, then I am paranoid to believe that everyone is out there to kill the Jews. On my side I have the PLO and Hamas charter to prove my point. What do you have on your side?|`|OQPxURekaa	Yeah I agree with the others: you seem sadly unaware of the need for justice for the Palestinians. Shouting one-sided legalistic nonsense is childish and ignorant.|`|lXxz4Qpkaa	The U.S. is firmly committed to the establishment of the State of Palestine consisting of the West Bank and the Gaza. We will use NATO troops to free it off jewish occupation if we have to. So get used to it.

Its aim is to turn everybody into Muslims and free countries into dictatorships by terrorism. Hamas, Hezbollah, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al Qaida are actually the same organization advocating the same things. As to creating a state run by a terrorist organization, there will have to be a united Palestinian government, and the Hamas Charter will have to be amended for a Palestinian state to come into being since it advocates the destruction of the Jewish state. Gaza will go nowhere under the Hamas regime. There are the Four Guarantors overseeing the peace process, and the world community will vote according to their recommendations after they are satisfied that such a state would not become another Nosrallah's South Lebanon.|`|iCMrsV9daa	YES.<br>  why does the terrorist state of Israel have a right to exist? Israel is no better and you know it. <br>  <br>  in 1948 palestinians were brutally kicked out of their homes by force to make room for the new Israeli families. They were kicked out so a jewish family from europe could move into their homes!!! Palestinians escaped fearfull of their lives, they would not even let a mother into her house to get her crying baby, sometimes they wernt even allowed to take their stuff. People that did not cooperate were raped, abused, killed. people were made to leave with just the clothes on their back. And now you want to delete this peice of history because its not "convienent" to you??? well the holocaust is not "convenient" to anybody, it gives you a chance to use it as a guilt trip on everybody that israelis are the poor helpless people and that they should be able to have their peice of land at any price. should the world just deny the holocaust? im not saying its the same thing but stop trying to spray flowers and sunshine on Israels dirty past. admit when Israel is wrong and stop trying to confiscate palestinian history because thats a crime in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of god. <br>  <br>  Here's a question in regards to the not so greater Israel: why is Israel the only country in the world that hasnt defined its borders? what are Israels borders? The reason: it cannot define its borders because it wants to continue to colonize Palestinian land in the West Bank and in the Gaza strip.|`|zpvOGzT6aa	I'm pretty sure that the proposed state will not be run by Hamas.  The whole world including the EU and the US lists Hamas as a Terror organization because they target peaceful civilians and because they refuse to recognize an established country's existence.  The negotiations go on with Palestinian Authority President Mahmood abbas AKA Abu Mazen.  The only problem with that is that he has no control over Hamas so his promises for stopping terror attacks never panned out.|`|8FbeckyLaa	Hamas is considered as a "terrorist Org." because they are fighting zionists! any one who fights zionists is a terrorist but when zionists fight and kill innocent civilians, no one labels them as "Murderes".|`|d117226cff9e65399c2226c82fd237a5aa	TO BE FAIR YOU SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT<br>   THE JEWS ACTUALLY INVADED THEIR COUNTRY ABOUT 60 YEARS AGO AND KILLED MANY MANY INNOCENT PALASTINIAN CHRISTIANS AND MOSLEMS BEFORE RUNNING THE REST OFF.

For strategic reasons, China would like another shipping access to the west if Malacca straits is obstructed. But there are people and homes to relocate. South Thailand is unstable with lots of terrorists bombings and related murders. Thailand itself is unstable at the moment. Nowhere in developing world where demonstrators are allowed to close down its airports for weeks. The generals, ruling Royal families and businessmen are playing their proxy game.

VjPnHxZyaa	Aruba is wonderful, that is our destination vacation every year.  We own 5 weeks there and love every minute of our home away from home.  Dinning in Aruba can be somewhat expensive, but there are many coupons and discounts available for you.  The previous poster added some great websites, but also visit www.aruba-bb.com you will also be given a bag with coupons in it once you land in Aruba as you exit the airport.  On the visit aruba website you can purchase a "Visit Aruba discount card"  It is well worth the price and gives you discounts for entertainment, dinning, activities and shopping.  One thing to keep in mind when dinning in Aruba is that many times the gratuity is included in your final bill so be aware of that.  You can rent a car and tour the island, there are so many things to do and see.  The best part of Aruba is the water and if your into relaxation, then this is the place for you.  Aruba tourist area has been divided up into two sections, the low rise area on Eagle Beach where you have most of your older timeshares and a beautiful beach.  Or the High rise section with your chain hotels on Palm Beach.  The water there is calmer and the beach is narrower and there are definetly more people on Palm Beach.  Palm beach is a hub bub of activity, where Eagle Beach area is more quiet and really not much night life to speak of, unless your staying at the Tamajrin or the Divi resorts.  So you just need to decide what you want and where you want to stay.  But try to go to these websites they will help you out a great deal....have a wonderful vacation and Happy Anniversary!|`|iiLSqIzUaa	Yes, we have been twice and going back again in May.  It is a fab place to visit especially for an anniversary  Celebrate with a special meal on the beach at Passions Restaurant attached to the Amsterdam Manor Beach Resort, it is wonderfully romantic setting.  We prefer to stay at the low rise section of Eagle Beach.  The larger hotel chains are at Palm Beach.  Lots to do, plenty of good restaurants and very laid back.  We did not think that anything was expensive but we are from England and used to high prices!  Go and enjoy yourselves.  Check out websites, www.visitaruba.com or www.aruba.com|`|c46a5eeb1d697d05457a2e13927d7ab4aa	I just came back on Friday.    It's not too expensive there.   They have great restaurants.   I am a big fan of El Gaucho and Cuba's Cooking.  As you are celebrating your anniversary though,  I would try Passions,  you will have a table right on the beach. Not sure what other advice you need.   Eagle Beach is less crowded that Palm Beach.  Are you looking to go all inclusive or not?  Have you checked Tripadvisor.com?   The forums on there are great!|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	no

After all most of the Roman army was made up of Celts (Gauls) from mainland Europe. <br>  <br>  Although they fought, and defeated the Pictish leader Calgacus at Mons Graupius in AD84, the Romans could never master Caledonia and by 211 had retreated behind Hadrians wall, about a hundred miles to the south. By 410 they had left Britain for good. <br>   <br>  The first United Scotland<br>  By the sixth century four Kingdoms had developed in what is now Scotland;<br>  To the North, the Picts,<br>  To the far West, the Scots<br>  To the West, the Britons<br>  To the South-East, the Angles. <br>  <br>  For the next two of hundred years these four kingdoms struggled, beset by Viking raiding parties , until in the 9th century the King of Dalraida, Kenneth MacAlpin, fought his way to something like a united Scotland. His Grandson, Duncan I, became the first King of Scotland in 1035 <br>   <br>  Medieval and Renaissance Edinburgh<br>  Although at this time Scottish rulers tended to base themselves further north across the Forth, King Malcolm III Canmore (died 1093) built his castle at Edinburgh, and his wife Queen (Saint) Margaret built a chapel within its walls - now the oldest building in the city. <br>  <br>  Her son, David I built the Abbey at Holyrood, a mile to the East along "The Royal Mile". Castle and Abbey became the anchor points of Edinburgh; a thriving town grew up along side the road between them, connected to Leith, Edinburgh's port and trade-link to the world. (see map above) <br>  <br>  During the Wars of Independence Edinburgh Castle was captured by the English until Robert the Bruce's nephew, Thomas Randolph daringly recapture it by climbing its steep and craggy sides in the dead of night. Robert the Bruce granted Edinburgh a Royal Charter in 1329. <br>  <br>  If Edinburgh did not grow outwards at this time, it did grow upwards. By the end of the 1500's it was established as the Capital of Scotland, and growing in population the inhabitants chose to build high houses close to the protection of the Castle: high tenement buildings most of which can be seen to this day. <br>  <br>  When King James VI inherited the throne of England in 1603, Edinburgh ceased to be the principal site of the royal court, although it did continue to have its own Parliament. <br>   <br>  Georgian Edinburgh<br>  Everything changed after the Act of Union in 1707... Parliament ceased in Edinburgh, but the city prospered. The loch below the North side of the castle was filled in. New streets and and thousands of houses were planned and built in the Classical fashion (see map again). <br>  <br>  This period of energetic building during the "Enlightenment", which lasted into the 1800's, has left the city one of the most architecturally beautiful in the world.<br>  See Georgian Edinburgh: (The New Town) <br>   <br>  <br>  To the present day<br>  During the Victorian era expansion continued to grow, but the Old Town tenements around the Royal Mile declined into slums where poor people lived in cramped and unsanitary conditions. Industry flourished in Glasgow, but Edinburgh remained the preserve of professionals, which it has tended to remain. <br>  <br>  Since the last war its prestige has risen not least because of the establishment of the Edinburgh Festival. In the 1960's he city was being torn down and rebuilt at an alarming rate , but fortunately the New Town Conservation Committee (formed in the 70's) put a stop to that. Buildings have been restored using traditional and sympathetic methods, and now the city looks as though it will remain as one of Europe's most beautiful and historically interesting living monuments.|`|CrjozlCjaa	I don't think the Scots would be very happy about that.    Also, as Guiri says, England was settled by Angles, Saxons and Jutes, overrun by the Romans, invaded by the Vikings while the original inhabitants retreated to the hills.

hgaNxhoaaa	If she speaks English, there are a multitude of things she can do here. If she speaks Korean, they'll love her even more! There are honestly endless opportunities for English speakers here, regardless of profession. Most foreigners here don't speak Korean, so she'd actually have an upper hand compared with other foreigners.<br>  <br>  If she's looking for an in, tell her to come and teach English first (there are institutes all over the place or you can do it privately). She can make some good money doing that while she hunts for other opportunities.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|YDt2eckraa	mhmmm,,,<br>  i highly doubt it. as a person who knows really well about the korean pop/entertainment culture, its almost impossible for foreigners to become an 'MC'. you require PERFECT korean, must know lots of slangs (like you need to be korean..) and able to understand and lead the program in every single way. It is possible to become just foreigner celeb appearing in certain shows, but dont count on it... there are lots of foreigner celebs in korea now (well they think they are celeb) but mostly they are ridiculously hot, or really funny. and those people usually married a korean wife or something so they know korean like the natives. also, Korean media and viewers' opinion on other coloured celebs are still not goood... ive only seen some whites (and theyre mostly central asian like uzbec) or japanese get some attention here (there was half chinese half british as well). ive never ever seen an indian person or south east asian...|`|2b97e016ad66437b36147f9acd28a75baa	Just because she's Indian that doesn't mean a Belgian guy can and she can't.<br>  <br>  Actually, many Indian women (and men, too) are pretty good looking.<br>  No, not everyone from India looks like Bollywood stars but they often look pretty good.<br>  <br>  It's going to be hard for her, of course, but if that's what she truly wants, encourage her and even if she fails, don't critisize her too harshly.<br>  <br>  Tell her to keep working on her Korean and to perfect her accent.<br>  A little bit of foreign accent in spoken Korean sometimes would even make her special because unlike English-speaking countries, you don't hear a whole lot of ppl even trying to learn Korean in the first place because.. when ppl learn Asian languages, it's usually either Mandarin or Japanese - rarely would a person choose to learn Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog, etc.|`|BVeFxA6gaa	Okay well here's my opinion. It's true that the better your accent have the more they like it, but most Koreans love all foreigners who speaks Korean whether their accent is good or not and whether they know what they're saying or not.<br>  <br>  But satisfactory accent isn't all you know. I lived in Seoul for almost a year and I can speak korean quite well - though my accent is not so good lol - but still it's hard to watch Korean TV shows because I can't completely understand their culture things and something like that  - you know every language has slangs and there are so many irregular contractions and etc etc - though I'm living and talking with my roommate who born and raised in Seoul everyday.<br>  <br>  So I think it's quite hard but if she really really wants it then she should live here at least 3 yrs and think about it again.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	Probably one in a billion?<br>  Not very good. I've never seen a non-actor non-Korean person become famous in Korea. It's cut-throat competitive anyway and they wouldn't want a foreigner stealing a Korean person's place.<br>  To become an MC from somewhere else, you would basically have to be a Korean person in a non-Korean person's skin. Sorry.|`|CCChS7ydaa	there are many koreans in korea that have PERFECT korean and since they have been living there. There's billions of people wanting to be celebrities in korea..and out of the billions..your friend getting picked is very slim.<br>  as for the chances, she must know how to carry on the show, and have PERFECT korean not satisfactory.

9DJ63NKdaa	ok well whoever wrote this is deff not a fluent speaker but its says:<br>  A sad tale of Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a lecture of a boy who is very bored on Sundays so he wrote in the paper that he was looking for a girl. After three days a girl wrote back and said that she was also bored on Sundays. So the girl and the boy went to a cafe and had lemonade and icecream. during the night the kids didnt talk much and there was lots of silence. They were still bored so they went to see a drama movie. in the movie they didnt talk much and the boy fell asleep. after ten minutes  the girl also fell asleep. After reading the lecture i thought that the girl was very good for the boy. They had much in commom for exampe they werent big talkers and they also didnt have anything to do on Sundays. In my opinion the lectura wasnt sad it was realistic because in real life people are very normal and their lives arent interesting. People read the newspaper and go to cafes and movies during the night. In conclusion this tale of Gabreil Garcia Marque is very different but also a little funny. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|wU94PVW1aa	Is this for your homework?<br>  <br>  Give it a go yourself - it's not a difficult piece at all.<br>  <br>  You may actually learn something, as I just did, but picking up your dictionary.
bNrrTyrQaa	Hi! u will have a great time on the cruise! Dont worry about the whole no hip hop thing! There is pkenty of hip hop on board and the night clubs will be rockin! And im sorry to tell u but yes they are very strict onboard any cruise ship. ur seas card that u bye the drinks with will say that u r underage and they will not give u alcohol! It will be a breeze for u to meet people! From all the clubs to just talking during dunner or talking to people on the pool deck u will b fine! For ur mom and u there will be plaenty of stuff to do. While on the islands go shopping. Bahamas have cool and neat places to shop while on the islands marketplaces and everything. Also while onboard u and ur mom should go to the spa together and just relaxxx and talkkk! All in all ur vacation will b a great time!!!<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful trip!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Actually it completely depends on the ship.  Most have at least 5 lounges playing different types of music and usually the club shuts down one night for Teen night.  Every time I've walked by it's been playing modern Top 40 type music though they do occasionally throw in like Backstreet Boys or something to clear the dance floor for no reason.  Like I said there are numerous clubs/lounges on the ship and they usually kinda divide up by age with older people are hanging out at one of them and the college kids taking over another one.<br>  <br>  Like the others said, yes they are really strict on the drinking policy.  The Sail and Sign card will not let you charge alcohol.  <br>  <br>  It will be really easy for you to meet people.  All the teenagers seem to find each other very easily, plus you will most likely be sitting at dinner with people close in age to you.  As for if there will be a lot of people 17-23 there, I don't know.  That depends on the ship.  You cannot book a room by yourself unless you are 25 so they would have to be with an older parent.  I know there will be lots of people 16-18, but the college age crowd depends on what time of year it is.<br>  <br>  You do not pay for the water slide or pools, or use of the fitness center.  That is included with your cruise.  The spa is extra.  As for how much that is, depends.  Like all spas, you can get the $500 treatment but they also have daily specials and at the art auction they auction off a spa package so I've gotten massage packages for $60.<br>  <br>  Carnival is an odd cruiseline with formal night.  It is all over the board.  You will see lots of people in prom dresses.  You will see lots of cocktail attire (my school called it Winterfest).  Then you will also see the people that consider khakis and a polo to be "formal".  Carnival never seems to tell people they are not dressed appropriately.  The rules are "resort casual" after 6--no shorts, no tanks, no bathing suits.  At dinner most nights, most people wear a sundress or a cute skirt with formal night being something extra.  If you wear a prom dress you will see plenty of others dressed the same and it's a great opportunity to get a picture of you as the ship is filled with photographers.|`|XBulMn2zaa	There are several music venues, but normally none that play the kind of music you asked about.  The cruise lines are among the most strict on age.  You will meet people easily. There is always a substantial number of people your age, and activities are arranged so that you can meet each other.  Also, if you go to cruise critic.com, you will be able to meet people before you get on the ship.  There are usually seminars and classes that are fun.  These are both free and there should be at least a couple during your cruise that you would like.  Water ride and fitness center are free.  Fees vary for the spa and are usually about a third more than on land.  People will dress every way there is for formal nights from tux and gowns to pantsuit to long skirt or dress pants and nice top.  A formal dress isn't too much, but isn't necessary either.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Cruisecritic.com can answer a lot of your questions.  Also your travel agent can answer you questions.

The main regulations are searchable and you can find them on the legislation website - but unless you know what you're searching for you may not find them.  If you just want general points - the websites are where you should look.  <br>  <br>  When you leave New Zealand, there are standard things like checking you have the right travel documents (passports, visas) and of course the airline staff will ask you questions about what is in your luggage or your hand luggage (dangerous goods and prohibited items like scissors).  I think Biosecurity will be more concerned when you come back in - making sure you aren't carrying any food, particularly fresh food is a big focus.  Most of what they are interested in is covered in the Declaration Card you'll complete when you return - it's aimed at keeping pests and diseases out of NZ.|`|qU1G6FmHaa	The Legislation and the Regulations are readily accessible online by googling <a href="http://newzealand.govt.nz." rel="nofollow">http://newzealand.govt.nz.</a><br>  The site will then link you to all the relevant information you are after.

Established in 1962, OB still operates from its original location, Anakiwa, in the Marlborough Sounds. Anakiwa (near Picton) is regarded as the most perfectly situated Outward Bound school in the world. The natural timbered buildings merge gracefully into the curve of the bay and are backed by native bush. A long jetty stretches to where the school’s small fleet of cutters are at anchor.  The ‘classrooms’ of the school are the native bush, mountains, rivers and seaways of Marlborough. The Outward Bound Trust of New Zealand is a member of Outward Bound International. This was founded by Kurt Hahn in Wales in 1941. There are 42 member countries. Hahn was an educator. In his words: “We are all better than we know. If only we can come to discover this, we may never again settle for anything less.” <br>  <br>  Our Vision<br>  Helping to create 'better people, better communities, better world.'<br>  <br>  <br>  Our Mission<br>  Outward Bound New Zealand's mission is inspiring personal and social development through value based experiential learning in an outdoor environment. Outward Bound New Zealand is a charitable trust <br>  <br>  Our Values<br>  Outward Bound is founded on universal values: Compassion, Greatness, Responsibility and Integrity. These values form the basis of all our courses. <br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|0xfVyxxIaa	I've always heard it's awesome.
2HETgiwgaa	It's amazing - I highly recommend it.  I did the three week course when I was almost 22 - I think on my course we had people aged from 18-26.  It is very hard work - but you will enjoy it.  Make sure you have got as fit as possible before you go - I was a bit slack about that, and it did make a difference.  Don't take anything you're particularly fond of - everything gets thoroughly muddy and wet - you'll get used to the smell of the drying room :-)  And, take lots of photos, it's great to look back.  One of the things you can do on solo is write a letter to yourself, it sounds a little odd - but you learn so much about yourself (good and bad) and looking back on that letter is fascinating years later.  The only thing I really regret is not joining Outward Bounders afterwards; I lost touch with everyone on my watch.  I was in Scott watch - and I would love to know what they are doing now.  There were 14 people in my watch, 6 men and 8 women, ranging from someone who was working for a lawyer and quit to do Outward Bound when she couldn't get the time off, to someone who was finishing a prison sentence and had a 12 yr old daughter - she was one of the best value people on the course, I think she should've been a stand-up comic.  You'll meet people from all walks of life, it'll push you mentally and physically and you'll never be the same.  If you have the chance, DO IT :-)|`|0xfVyxxIaa	I've always heard it's awesome.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	its hard nut all the people i have meet that did it say its brilliant, congradulations its a once in a lifetime opportunity, im too old but wish i had done it|`|vXgF2fMoaa	Bro do it.you will love it!!!i done it when i was 17yrs.it was part of a school thing,this was couple years ago.Trust me if your adventrous or want to try something diffrent then outward bounds is the place.Its pretty tough tho...........physically and most definitly mentally...<br>  <br>  Everymorning you do a 2.7km run(i think) then jump in the water,(this is just to wake you up and start your day.<br>  Best part of it tho is meeting great friends from all over nz and even the world.<br>  They (the locals of outward bounds) are awesome<br>  <br>  My advice for you is to go there prepared for the challanges and to expect the unexpected,Go their to learn,and enjoy it,<br>  The one thing i didnt like was having to sleep in the bush with possums,(im a city guy so that'll explain it),but it was worth the experience.<br>  <br>  So do it bro and hopeyou do tackle it.......<br>  Oh and just to let you know i was part of the SHACKLETON WATCH.<br>  You will find out when you get their......|`|9RC2EPANaa	my friend did it a few years ago, its really hard work, you have to do lots of running! he had a really good time though. i'd like to do it myself, especially having to survive in the bush for two days

z8jYprWkaa	No it should not grind to a hault - or even a halt - but until such times as we build up a sufficient stock of snow clearing equipment and enough salt and grit then it will continue every time we get a heavy-ish fall of snow or prolonged sub-zero temperatures.|`|ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	Let's get something straight - the UK does NOT grind to a halt when there is snow. ONLY ENGLAND comes to a standstill.<br>  <br>  And that is because the English are so arrogant that they fail to listen to weather forecasts and fail to take precautions.<br>  <br>  In the last three days, parts of Scotland have had far deeper snow that England had last month. Did it make the national news? NO? Why? Because the Scots cope. I drove home on Tuesday through a raging blizzard with snow drifting across the road. Did I grind to a halt? NO.<br>  <br>  The fuss that the lazy, weak, pathetic English made last month about their light dusting of snow has made them the laughing stock of mainland Europe.<br>  <br>  So, in future, get your questions right. ONLY THE ENGLISH grind to a halt when it snows - NOBODY ELSE|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	it grinds to a halt because it is unusual these days and we are not used to it.  A sudden change will always cause disruption|`|bhNaTYjOaa	No of course not, but what needs to be balanced is the cost of dealing with what is a comparatively rare occurrence. Should local councils spend large sums of money acquiring snow ploughs, snow blowers, and huge quantities of salt if for most of the time they sit in a depot unused? Council tax payers and indeed tax payers are always carping on about increases in taxes and whether they are sensibly spent. You can't compare the UK to countries where snow is a certainty every year - Canada, Finland, etc etc.|`|JltE5LIHaa	No but it does. You don't see the Scandinavian countries stopping because of an inch or two of snow. It didn't stop me going to work nor going up into the hills to see my horse. Bring it on!|`|4kxg48quaa	We only let it grind to a halt because people will take any excuse not to work.|`|gg9NifDeaa	No it shouldn't is the short answer! I lived just outside Chicago for 2 winters and that was bad snow but it didn't mean that everything stopped. You just got wrapped up and dealt with it. What we get in the UK is nothing compared to that. I suppose they are used to that kind of weather every winter whereas we only get it sporadically. <br>  <br>  I think the main reason everything grinds to a halt is health and safety - schools can't have children slipping on ice or being hit by a snowball cos everyone seems to have forgotten that these things happen and it is no reason to sue. The other thing is that a lot of people who 'can't' get in to work have chosen to do long commutes or live in rural locations and are basically unprepared for bad weather,<br>  <br>  It is a bit ridiculous when everything grinds to a halt but I have to say I enjoyed the snow day we had a few weeks ago!!

kgBPU4xxaa	In your case, I would take the train to Verona because it's the fewest transportation changes. The bus station is right outside the train station and you can get a bus to Malcesine from there. There's a schedule for the bus to Malcesine at: www.apt.vr.it/pdf/62-64.pdf  <br>  <br>  Note that you could also take the train to Peschiera which is the first stop on Lake Garda. The same bus stops at the train station there on the way to Peschiera or you can get a boat up the lake to Malcesine. The boat is much slower, but a nice trip. <br>  <br>  If you go all the way to Rovereto, you can take a bus to Torbole, but then you need to change buses to get to Malcesine. You'll also have a train change in Verona.<br>   <br>  I live about an hour south of Lake Garda. When I go to Malcesine, I usually go to Desenzano (the next train stop after Peschiera del Garda) and get the boat from there, but I'm never in a hurry.|`|d1af129c0a31108c895fa2c27fe0efbfaa	I suppose Verona is better than Rovereto. (and you would have to pass from Verona to get to Rovereto by train).<br>  <br>  For train timetable, fare, etc. see<br>  <a href="http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=3fdbe14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/i...</a><br>  <br>  For information about tourism in Malcesine see<br>  <a href="http://www.malcesinepiu.it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.malcesinepiu.it/</a><br>  (there is even a section for people who want to make a wedding in Malcesine)<br>  <br>  <br>  but actually there are no informations about buses.<br>  You can try to e-mail the tourism office (the address a a little bit hidden but you can find it)<br>  <br>  or you can look at<br>  <a href="http://www.apt.vr.it/pdf/48-49.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.apt.vr.it/pdf/48-49.pdf</a><br>  Plese be careful to take into account note and restriction for every service.<br>  I do not know if there are any other service by other companies.<br>  <br>  Remember that you need to buy a ticket before boarding the train and you need to stamp it with  the date and time by using the special stamping machine *BEFORE* boarding the train.<br>  <br>  For the bus the same apply but the machine is inside the bus (you should buy the ticket before boarding the bus and you should validate it with date and time when you board the train).<br>  <br>  It is not at all a short journey. Form Verona you it takes a little less than 2 hours.<br>  <br>  You can also reach Malcesine by lake boat, but this would take even more ...<br>  <br>  Rovereto or Trento would actually be nearer to Malcesine but I am not sure there would be a bus from there (you would have to cross the region boundary) <br>  <br>  If you prefear to route from Rovereto, you should first go to Rovereto, than take the bus from Rovereto to Riva del garda <br>  and than take a bus from Riva del garda to Malcesine.<br>  The last bus is the same line that connect Verona to Malcesine (but in opposite direction) so you find the timetable in the link I posted before. For the timetable from Rovereto to Riva del garda<br>  look at<br>  <a href="http://srvtt.pegasus.it/OrariDiLinea/Orari%20di%20Direttrice%20-%20E08I%20-%20301A.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://srvtt.pegasus.it/OrariDiLinea/Ora...</a><br>  and your starting stop is Rovereto (Staz. FS)<br>  <br>  I do not know which route is the faster.<br>  <br>  I hope you will enjoy your stay and many wish to the wedding couple!<br>  <br>  P.S. Actually line 62-64 that departs from Verona also stop in Peschiera del garda. So it is surely faster to get the bus there than in Verona (but be sure that your train stops in Peschiera del garda). This seems to be the faster route of the three options.

Besides what has been already answered, it's as much as I know.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Read past Q & A  here well enough.|`|msOABQbSaa	I went when i was 15 for a school trip, we had a 2000yen allowance for each meal, i cant remember what was where, but we went to a place called the sky tower.  TOKYO DISNEY SEA / WORLD is a must.  Disney sea is a more teenage version we got told.  But it was amazing.  We stayed in the Tokyo International Youth Hostel, it was great, in the centre of the city if i'm remembering right. (i'm not pulling this from the top of my head, i have the itinerary in front of me).  You could do day trips to the islands close by, there are heaps of great temples and the shopping is awesome.|`|rRc9KDlsaa	you should try travel sites that book flights and hotels together. those seem to be the most value for your money. like expedia, travelocity, etc. I planned to do the same thing your doing, so ive been researching alot lately. with most of these sites, the longer you stay, the less it is per day. I know the Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa has alot of things to do around and near the hotel itself. Plus it has two different train stations just blocks away from the hotel. These can take you almost anywhere in Tokyo. =)
