isadV8SHaa	first, <br>  T1 service is considered a "critical" service by FCC mandate.  If you have any problems with it, you can immediately light fires under multiple people at the network operation control center (NOCC) in charge of the lines to get it fixed.  You can get people working on it within 2 minutes of picking up the phone, not some troubleshooting technician, but real hands-on network people.<br>  <br>  second, <br>  T1 service gives you private direct access to the biger bandwith farther downstream, so there is never any issue with other users on the "same lines" that may be using up part of your bandwidth (although a fiber optic cable is less prone to this, it is very common in dense cable internet subscription areas).<br>  <br>  third, <br>  T1 service gives you guaranteed UPLOAD speeds that are equivalent to the download speeds.  This is critical if you have any servers on your network that are accessed from outside the company.  I think if you read the fine print in the fiber optic offering, the "blazing fast" upload speed is probably about half of what you get through your 3 megabit T1 setup.<br>  <br>  fourth, <br>  Consistency.  It is easy to build a network infrastructure around a consistent amount of bandwidth.  T1 lines do not fluctuate.  You always know exactly how much bandwidth you have.  There is no "Up To" 1.54 Megabits, there is only 1.54 megabits. Exactly.  The cheap fiber service will give you "Up to" their max rated speed, even on uploads.  You can't build any sort of reliable network around that.<br>  <br>  fifth<br>  Traffic shaping.  On an "all you can eat" plan, like the fiber optic one, the ISP will monitor and manage certain types of traffic from certain users so that the whole pipe is never completely used up.  Some types of services will be given restricted bandwidth, (or not allowed altogether).  This is not done on T1 lines.  It is no business of the service provider what you are using your T1 line for (although they can complain to you or blacklist you if they get reports of spam coming from your IP addresses).  You can do whatever you want with it.<br>  <br>  T1 service is like eating at a fine restaurant.  Everyone caters to you, you order what you want, and you get high quality cuisine.  Shared variable service is like eating at a buffet.  It's first come first serve, you may not always get what you want, there is no personal service, but hey, it's cheap.<br>  <br>  In response to the additional details:<br>  You have enough people in your office to prett easily choke your T1 setup, especially with 20-ish vpn connections coming in, but the setup does sound reasonable.  I personaly would run about a month of internet usage statistics, and use that to consider increasing the number of T1 lines.<br>  <br>  Oh, one more thing... if two T1 lines are within $20 of the Comcast offering, you are either getting a fantastic price on your T1s, or a horrible deal on the fiber.  Can you post a link to the fiber offering you are referring to? Thanks.

zlCTStzraa	The same website can go for $100's or $1000's. In real life, it has to do with location (and budget of the company) more than the quality of the site. I would price what other people in your area are charging. For instance, what does your employer charge customers? Otherwise, take into account (where ever you feel your skill level is at) that car mechanics, for example, will charge $60 / hour (actually, probably closer to $90/ hr). So estimate how much time you think you would spend and then give that flat fee. <br>  <br>  I have also heard that tables take longer to render (not necessarily just downloading the code), but I haven't ever tested the performance difference. It's probably negligible. But CSS stylesheets are faster from a design perspective -- you don't have to make changes to each page if you want to adjust colors or even the whole structure.|`|GpitqYxcaa	You could go with <a href="http://www.salary.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.salary.com.</a> Like the other answer said, you could charge anywhere from 100 dollars to 1,000 dollars depending on how much work you put into the website. I'm a web developer and I'm having trouble figuring out how much to charge people for jobs. If the website is in THAT bad condition then you could charge a little bit more and take advantage of their desperation. I have never heard of tables loading slower or vice versa either.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  -Billy|`|QhWMBd7aaa	You can register at freelance websites like <a href="http://getafreelnacer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://getafreelnacer.com/</a> , <a href="http://scriptlance.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://scriptlance.biz/</a> , <a href="http://eufrelance.com/" rel="nofollow">http://eufrelance.com/</a> ,etc and start bidding for all web designing projects posted there , from average bid posted for few projects you can get fair amount of idea on how much to charge for any web designing projects .|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Try to decide how much time it is likely to take and they apply the hourly rate you are used to, but add about 30% for the benefits you aren't getting.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	If it is static content I would suggest $300 per page, and then charge them $50/hour to make more changes once your new page has gone live.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Corsair is a good one, but look for the best price/ratings from buyers. 2GB is the maximum your computer will accept, which means to max out your RAM, you should purchase two 1GB modules.

The only thing you need to make sure of is that it is DDR 266, not DDR2 or DDR3.<br>  <br>  According to Dell, the maximum capacity is 2 gigabyte of memory, which means you can use up to two 1 gigabyte modules.

3dv7Qdoxaa	I, for one, cannot stand Macs. I'll just get that out of the way first. <br>  <br>  Mac Positives: Good for video/picture editing, good for creating websites/coding, good for presentations (powerpoint style), all MacBooks are the same, so if you have a problem it's usually easy to fix.<br>  <br>  Mac Negatives: They are very overpriced, they don't support nearly as many programs as a Windows laptop will, they are bad for gaming (but I assume you're not into that).<br>  <br>  <br>  Windows Positives: Can run all games, runs many, many more programs than a Mac does, prices are realistic, you get a much larger amount of choices when choosing one, and a Windows laptop can do anything a Mac can do and more, but a Mac cannot do all the things a Windows comp. can do. <br>  <br>  Windows Negatives: There is a greater risk for a getting a virus if you don't use virus protection. That's about it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Some extra things to think about:<br>  If you get a Windows laptop, just know that almost all of the Vista issues from a while ago have been fixed, so don't let Vista scare you away from a Windows laptop. <br>  <br>  Also, Windows 7 will be released in a just a few months which you will most definitely want to upgrade to. If you don't know too much about Windows 7 I would read up on it. It's going to be amazing.

It all depends on what you will be using it for.  If you're just using it like most people do: browsing the internet, storing photos, listening to music... etc.  I suggest MacBook.  If you're needs are more sophisticated: Music Production *like me* Editing Video/Photos, etc. then I would suggest MacBook Pro. <br>  <br>  PCs are trash.  However, Macintosh builds the computers to fit the hardware and vice versa.  They're a perfect match.  Check out the website for further information.

Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

FqrKjtzwaa	In most laptops, the backlight contains a small amount of mercury (this is true of all fluorescent bulbs). But if the backlight still lights up, then it probably hasn't broken. Therefore as long as you are careful to avoid any broken glass and such, it should be safe to use (I don't think there aren't any "rays" or other substances that you need to worry about).

NjnU2DVWaa	I converted from PC to Mac and it's not really hard at all to switch.  The concepts are similar, but Macs make USING it easier.  It's more intuitive.  Like I said in your other similar question, the key is to make yourself versatile.  Get things like Flip4Mac (see the other answer).  The only real problems come from people who still "live in the past."  Every once in a while you'll come across a website that says that "Internet Explorer is required to view the page."  Honestly, there's no excuse for them to say that in today's world.  What messages like that mean is that those web designers don't know how to write standard code, they only know how to write the screwy code that Explorer reads.  But it doesn't happen very often anymore, and it shouldn't.  People are learning that there is a much bigger world out there than just Internet Explorer.  I would download Firefox (even on a PC) in addition to using Safari.  Safari is great, but it's best to keep more than one browser (even on a PC) in case a page doesn't work in one but does in another.  Again, that's the same as a PC, people just don't know any better.  Safari and Firefox are also both faster than Internet Explorer.<br>  <br>  Other people who "live in the past" are dead set on using Microsoft Office and they'll tell you that you "have to get it" when getting a Mac.  But there's no need to when NeoOffice does the same thing, will open ANY Microsoft Office file and also SAVE in Microsoft Office format, and is free.  Don't pay $300 for Microsoft Office when you can have something that does the same thing for free.<br>  <br>  Also, get on iTunes and go to the iTunes store and subscribe to the "Apple Quick Tips" podcast.  It's a free video podcast that gives you LOTS of good tips.  You can see most of the current ones here, too... <a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/tips/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/pro/tips/</a><br>  Click on one on that page and the video comes up with the tip.<br>  <br>  And always, feel free to e-mail me (from my Yahoo Answers Profile) with any questions you have.  I love helping people with this stuff.  ;)|`|9VE68ZuOaa	It's ridiculously easy to convert to Mac OS X, and most people I talk to refuse to go back to using Windows after they switch. Apple makes it easy to transfer all your old files from your Windows PC to your new mac, and if you buy from an Apple Store and bring your PC, they will do it for you. Microsoft sells Office for Mac, which will remind you very much of the Windows version of Office. Also, most file types are supported by both Windows and Mac, so you can open up most types of documents. <br>  <br>  The main thing to get used to is finding where various items are located, but that will not take long. You will probably ask yourself why you ever used Windows once you see how easy and intuitive the Mac is!|`|99ab666d64d9efa53079a431c3c15bd0aa	Windows and MAC are completely different structures and navigations. A solid user of one will feel pretty foreign when trying to use the other type... for a while.  Perhaps a few days, a week.  <br>  <br>  That said, the DOCUMENTS you create on Windows Office are completely usable when switching over to MAC Office by Microsoft.

If this is visual studio you are using that will be in the debug or release subdirectory under your project.<br>  <br>  Perhaps save it to the root and use <br>  rocket1 = fopen("c:\\rocket1.txt", "r");<br>  to avoid confusion.<br>  <br>  You should also look at GetLastError and print that out to help diagnose the fail to open issue.

As I got older Linux joined and replaced in some circles UNIX and Windows pushed a lot of us intermediate and advanced users out and the Macintosh went into a temporary decline.<br>  <br>  As computers have gotten more important to our lives I've watched people lose respect for people who use other OSes.  This was always true to some extent -- a lot of Windows users started out as satisfied Mac users who wanted to keep their jobs.  But the invective has gotten a lot stronger and louder as time goes on.  I'm even starting to hear people curse Solaris (which is a UNIX) or curse UNIX and UNIX-derived OSes like Linux who are not using Solaris.<br>  <br>  All I can say is chill.  Moving to Linux and to a lesser extent BSD (though I'm primarily trained as an artist) has taught me that you don't have to expect too much of any one OS and that when you do not restrict yourself you will find there is something to meet your needs period.  There is especially no "one size fits all" for OSes now the computers are getting much more complicated.  There has been considerable pressure for the OLPC to dump sugar, which they just have, but not the least of this was Bill Gates complaining about how Streams, the User Interface, wasn't a desktop.  No it wasn't but if you ever saw a kid play with it -- they exactly do play with it, and it makes it real fun to learn, or to watch learning take place.|`|gz2JF00Saa	The best system overall in my opinion is Linux, although Open Solaris is looking better with every release. I personally am using Fedora core 10, which I like, but many people prefer Debian, Ubuntu, or others.<br>  <br>  Linux is fast, stable, secure, free, very customizable, open source, etc.<br>  <br>  The best windows system is windows 2000, because it is light weight, does not have the candy interface, is very fast, and is stable.|`|E3N016csaa	This is why I Love it SO GO GO Linux the best<br>  <br>  Ultimate Edition 2.0 is built based off Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex (daily build), by hand, it is w/o a doubt gorgeous.

Vista has a friendlier user interface than Xp, but again, it requires a newer, better computer.<br>  <br>  Mac cannot run almost any Windows software without VMware fusion, and macs require you use apple hardware. Most macs require a very high end Computer. However, they have a VERY friendly user interface, so if you're completely Computer illiterate, mac should do. If you don't like Microsoft or Windows, Mac is the way to go, it is a very good OS if you have the extra $.<br>  <br>  Linux is confusing and hard to use for an average computer user. Linux has no real installer, so if you want to install anything you will be stumped to install it. Linux is free however, so budget pc's would take this rought, and you can always upgrade.<br>  <br>  Once again, I recommend Windows for functionality if you want the most out of your OS.|`|kNmTxsPhaa	it depends. if you like to play games a lot then you should get windows vista. if not then windows xp is the one for you. but if you like to do things with media then you should get a mac os|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Vistsa Ultimate - for its live action video desktop that it has.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.)

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE. IF YOU'RE USING FIREFOX 3, YOU MIGHT<br>  WANT TO TRY A DIFFERENT BROWSER.|`|TQOLhV53aa	You can try Cucusoft YouTube, Which helps you download, convert, play and manage your favorite YouTube videos... and it's very easy to use.

If not, ehh.  But anyways, it's more than likely that the songs you've bought have DRM (digital Rights Management) on them, and WMM cannot import them.  If this is the case you have a few options.<br>  1. Download an MP3 of your song off Frostwire (Slightly illegal, but if you look at it as thus - you already own the song - it may clear your conscience (sp?)<br>  2. Buy another instance of your song off Amazon to get unprotected<br>  3. Get software to remove DRM (illegal)<br>  4. Burn the song to a CD and then rip it into iTunes (removes DRM)|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Please rephrase your question... Windows Movie Maker lets you take video clips and edit them together to make new video clips - it doesn't have any ability to download anything.<br>  <br>  The only way I could see Windows Movie Maker and iTunes being related, is if you created a video clip using Windows Movie Maker, and then added it to the video library in iTunes. If that's what you want to do, it's easy - just drag the video file to where it says "Library" in iTunes.

ZhkLlt8Yaa	The iMac will have a better performance than the macbook (comparing base models). Since you don't think you will notice a difference all you should consider is your lifestyle.  The iMac has a WAY bigger screen and is cheaper (in terms of hardware) so this is better for graphics design.

MPldgkkMaa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|NARak4iBaa	How long did it take before?  5mins?<br>  <br>  We don't really know what you are talking about.

AA11442722	First Linux is free so you won't need to spend a dime. <br>  <br>  OK, what those words say is important. Unlike Windoze, Linux doesn't crash without reason. It does not randomly eat a device or lose hardware. Something happened to cause Linux to crash. In fact you might just be a little impatient. After so many boots it has to do a file system check on your files. When it does that you'll drop out of the GUI to a text interface while it checks the file system integrity. Then when it's done it will move on to a normal boot. It is important not to interupt while it is checking file integrity. <br>  <br>  If the system has crashed what happened before it crashed? In /var/log there is a log file called boot and it may tell you exactly what is wrong. Another important log file is the dmesg file.  It is also in /var/log you can view these files by first going to that dir. <br>  cd /var/log <br>  less dmesg<br>  Press the > key to go to the end of the file and see where X crashed at.<br>  <br>  From what's in those log files experienced Linux users can help you identify the problem. In the 10+ years I've been running Linux and the hundreds of machines I've maintained on Linux I've had to do a wipe and load maybe 3 times. Odds are very slim that a wipe and load is the best solution to what is wrong and it's highly possible that your fix is a 30 second change to a configuration file. <br>  <br>  As to how to rescue the data on your hard drive. You can boot into the rescue mode of most distros, or you can boot into a distro like Knoppix and just backup your data to CD/DVD, network or flash drive. With your home dir your going to need to change ownership. Look on the Knoppix faq for how to make a drive writable and change ownership of the files so that you can access the hiden files. Lots of important things are saved off in files that start with a .  including your bookmarks, saved IM msgs, etc.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	When you get to the (all words) login prompt, log in.<br>  <br>  Then type these commands:<br>  <br>  sudo apt-get update<br>  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop<br>  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<br>  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart|`|5zSSGKBpaa	If you want to reinstall simply insert the ubuntu cd into the drive, turn the computer off and then on again and let it reinstall linux. Before you do that you definitely need to read some instructions.<br>  You will continue to have problem with linux if you do not read some instructions. Linux is not windows and you have to do things the linux way when using linux.<br>  Good luck

XYOYml59aa	Wait... I have vista sp1 and windows 7 beta. Windows 7 is working so much better than vista. <br>  <br>  You could also try looking for a laptop that comes with Vista but when windows 7 comes out, you get that for free if you want. They did this for vista and XP and i did see microsoft say something about this already, I'm just not sure when it will start, and who is going to be doing it, but I would look into it, that way you can upgrade if you want for free but have a laptop sooner|`|jHuIwZl8aa	That Compaq you plan to buy is a good choice with all  those viruses running on the net.<br>  Compaq is one of the few laptops with a built-in recovery partition where you just press F11 on bootup and the system will automatically restore to default , removing any viruses and trojans and won't delete or destroy your old data or information.<br>  <br>  That is a good feature. Also, they are very very sturdy and you can travel with this tank.<br>  ACER Aspire is another good laptop , slightly faster than Compaq and better for gaming as well as high-end graphic software. Both are inexpensive and reliable.<br>  <br>  Your choice.. As for Windows 7, don't hold your breadth. we are still fooling around with it and you will get an upgrade if you have Vista or Win XP originally installed on your laptop.|`|r5o4FjEYaa	I think they will provide a free/pay or some kind of other upgrade program to Windows 7 if u purchase now that came preloaded with Windows Vista. <br>  <br>  Windows 7 is really faster compared to Vista and it is much more stable.|`|bWy7g7QIaa	Buy it now the new windows will likely have a bunch of problems at first.

You computer is YOUR tool, not mine. Not anyone elses. I believe you may still be able to beta test Windows 7. So, you may want to try that first. <br>  Vista is a strong OS, and will be around for some time still. So, either way MS has ya by the short hairs. This is a personal choice in which no one but you can make. <br>  It's like giving advice on your Wife's choices in bed. Are you going to put up with that? LOL!

CsIvy5MAaa	Those are hidden files,  and you have 'show hidden files' checked. That's just telling you that they are in fact marked as hidden.<br>  <br>  They're put there in case something goes wrong while updating windows. It's a backup it does before installing any service pack update. You can delete them if you're inclined to, but you won't be able to uninstall service packs if you need to.<br>  <br>  (You will PROBABLY never need to uninstall a service pack)|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	Oh wow that's not a good sign!

Your best bet is to just delete System32, you may get a popup warning you that they're valuable system files or something, DON'T LISTEN TO IT! Windows is stored in it's own file hidden from everything, so it can't be deleted just through the file explorer.

I am pretty sure Console.Write() doesn't return ANYTHING. Which means it return void, nothing.

If C++ is what you want to learn then jump into it.  Go to the bookstore and look for a beginner book on C++ that comes with a compiler cd.  That is by far the best way to learn a single language.  When I was learning C++ I used Turbo C++ for dos.

0wUwKbHsaa	Are you sure it is the fan that kicks on and not the hard drive?  The hard drive moving fast can make quite the sound.  It also seems pretty weird that the fan kicks on every time you try to do something.  The fan either runs continuously or turns on when the CPU gets to hot.  It is not related to the processes going on in the computer.<br>  <br>  Also, I am not sure where your hard drive is or if you have more than one.  My external hard drive has its own tiny fan so often that kicks in after I start using the hard drive.<br>  <br>  To reiterate what others are saying ... the System Idle Process is not what is causing whatever problem you have.

AA10546015	I say XP is better in reliability, but Vista 64bit is way better in overall performance. XP is only able to utilize single core processors, so if you have a dual core and above your not getting the best processor performance. Overall your best bet is with Vista 64-bit because it recognizes up to 32GBs of RAM, unlike any 32 bit windows which only recognizes 3.2GBs of RAM. I myself on the other hand think that neither windows is that fantastic, I prefer Ubuntu overall because it is reliable, nearly maintenance-free because it doesn't need disk defraging, and all the applications are free and one does not have to have a mess of CD's and DVD's cluttering up ones desk.

qniel3Fcaa	Wow, good range. Well considering it's WOW which isn't really in need of high performance. You have a huge variety.  I prefer Toshiba. I am an avid computer and electronics enthusiast. And Toshiba's have by far the longest lifespan. Well besides the old IBM thinkpads. But you want new. I'd say take a look at the Toshiba x205. The new Qosmio is pittiful. The x205 is amazing. Check out the link below. Might be of some help as well. Also I've heard some good things about ASUS and Gateway's gaming laptops. Choose wisely.|`|T4rj6mUcaa	If i was you and had 1300 to spend, i would go to hp.com and build my own.

ktdMxaGuaa	This same thing happened to me!!! It turns out that external hard drives come formatted so that you can't transfer files greater then 4 gigs (it has something to do with interfacing with Windows ME). If you're a windows user you'll have to reset your FAT32, if you're a Mac user you'll have to reset your hard drive (doing this will erase everything, so make sure you back up your stuff first!) <br>  <br>  Your hard drive should come with instructions, either on paper or in a pdf which explain how to reformat. If they aren't there try the company's website.|`|FNzUrpayaa	Your USB is probably formatted in FAT32 which only supports 4GB transfers.  Format it in NTFS and it should work.|`|apJeVkfHaa	You have two problems. One 3 x 12 = 36 gigs. 178 + 36 = 204. You dont have enough room for all 3.<br>  <br>  Second, it sounds like the drive is formatted to be FAT32, a type of file system that allows you to name and arrange files onto a harddrive. FAT32 can only handle files less than 4 gigs. Anything greated than 4 gigs in a single file and it will complain.<br>  <br>  You have two solutions.<br>  <br>  1) If the video was split up into smaller files you could fit approx. 20 gigs more of video on the drive. The file sizes should be 3 gigs a piece.<br>  <br>  2) Convert the drive to NTFS if you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista. I wouldn't recommend doing this yourself. Get someone that knows about computers to do this for you.

That is what your BIL was connecting to.  <br>  <br>  In an apartment building the signal may be strong enough to be useful, in a single family home, it will be weak and intermittent.    Either way, you are stealing someone else's service.  Yes, a wireless adapter may be enough to get you minimal service this way, bearing in mind that if they wise up and secure their router, you're done.  <br>  <br>  P.S.   There are some municipalities that provide free universal wireless service.   Check with City Hall to see if that's the case where you are.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  Edit: Check with the university to see if that's the case.   Your BIL should be able to tell you as well.

JKfRtuHMaa	The best thing to do is to build a template page.  Make sure that you know what you will want on all pages, borders, links, banners, and such.  Then save it as a template.  From there, you simply open the file and add content and then make sure to use the save as.. function, and that you do not overwrite the existing file.  Sometimes it’s even wise to create a template folder and place a copy of the file there, just in case you accidentally overwrite it with the new content.

thmE2tf7aa	if you are using a USB  mouse (do not do this with a PS2 mouse) try unplugging it and replugging it back in, it is possible that when the mouse initialized it got stuck in that state, unplugging it or removing its batteries if it is wireless should reset it.  If that does not do the trick try using another mouse to see if the problem goes away if it does you mouse will likely need replaced.  If it does not go away it is a software issue which might be harder to track down.  <br>  <br>  If it is a software issue I would try reinstalling the drivers for the mouse and I would also run some anti-spyware, and anti virus software just to be certain that there was not some malicious piece of software running on your system.
NpZukuuraa	Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors. Most commonly, pcs can benefit from windows registry repair when performance issues arise.<br>  <br>  The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system. As a result, your pc performance suffers and a registry repair is the only option.<br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  Manual repair and maintenance of the registry is an extremely complex task that only the most technically inclined should take on or you run the risk of losing critical data and personal information or even worse end up with a computer that doesn't work at all. With the proper software, however, registry repair becomes a relatively stress free task that will improve your PC's performance without going round the twist and losing one's mind.<br>  <br>  Symptoms a pc registry repair is needed<br>  <br>  Performance issues that indicate the need for pc registry repair typically worsen and become more frequent over time. Once a registry repair is applied, however, there is a noticeable improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Computer setting change unexpectedly.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a good portion of the problems above, there is definitely the need for an XP registry repair. The best registry software offers free scans to help you detect the extent of the problems.|`|NPh1luGvaa	The first suggestion would always be to restart your computer.

AMD procs are tune for gaming, however intel will still be the best stable bet, one thing that really keeps me away from amd procs are that the socket for the chipset keeps changing. Which means you can't really upgrade to a better processor without replacing the motherboard.

And, of course, since software manufacturers pay the computer maker to include basic or trial copies of their software with every computer they sell, the factory image includes all those tacky extra programs. <br>  <br>  It's good to have a factory image in case your C drive gets corrupted. But if the hard drive itself fails, you won't be able to get to the image to use it.<br>  <br>  There should be instructions with you computer how to use the factory image.

R3UVYaHtaa	its like the difference between Heaven and hell , <br>  if you know all these information then you know what you are talking about ..... duck|`|7nimzIDsaa	Sounds-pth like a science-pth quiz, suffering socker tag - Sylvester<br>  <br>  Here you go:<br>  <br>  1) The difference between the DVD RW is that it is classified under the category of ODD (optical disk drive), along with your CD-RW/ROM, DVD-RW/ROM, CD-RW/DVD-RW combo drive and Blu ray as well.<br>  <br>  DVD-RW - DVD represents the format, R = read and W= write.<br>  DVD-ROM - Only reads DVD.<br>  <br>  The functionality of an ODD are burning aka copy data into a blank media disc (eg. dvd-r/rw, cd-r/rw, blu-ray and etc...) an reading data from a disc with contents in it.<br>  <br>  HDD - Hard drive represents storage for your computer, it is a place where you save your data files to, back up your favourites media content. Imagine a warehouse that you can store your grains and wheat. It works something like that. Like any real world simulation, you can partition your hard disk into more virtual drives like wise allocating the space to each of it.<br>  <br>  ODD isn't really necessary but it proves to be convenient every now and than, HDD is a must, you can boot up the operating system without it.<br>  <br>  2) Cooler is a very generic term of dissipating heat from your different hardware components enclosed in the pc chassis/casing.<br>  <br>  I will categories them into 2 forms.<br>  <br>  Chassis fans: comes in different sizes, and it depends on your chassis specification as well to mount this devices. Ranges from 80mm to 200mm in length. Longer length fans provide more 'wind power', but its noiser.<br>  <br>  Its purpose is to dissipate heat in the chassis, which is attributed from the different hardware components in it. Always get a good casing with a good air flow system, which does not literally translate to more or massive fans. The keyword is ergonomics.<br>  <br>  Moving on to the<br>  <br>  Component cooler: CPU, GPU, Rams and etc... cooling.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't go indepth to GPU and Rams, since your focus is on the cpu itself.<br>  <br>  CPU coolers aka the proper term is heat sink fan (HSF in short) serves as a cooling agent to channel heat away from the cpu, as the cpu is running its operations, without the cooler they will freeze out very easily. Freeze out is the term of like a force shutdown, which is a pretty handy tool that comes with the bios, but isn't healthy in the long run.<br>  <br>  Thermal compounds on the other hand, is like a paste you spread evenly across the surface of the processor after placing it nicely in the motherboard socket. Its purpose is to act as a middle agent to effectively bring heat to the cpu cooler for dissipation. In other words, cooling will be more effecient and likewise there is significant temperature drop with the assistance of a thermal compound.<br>  <br>  3) Anti virus programs are the basic tools for operating system security, they offer real time protection and scans to prevent any malicious program from executing causing potential harm to the system.<br>  <br>  Internet security suite is a compilation of several tools into one, for example virus , spyware, malware, firewall and etc... scanner all into one. Its like a complete package for busting the unwanted.<br>  <br>  Do you need both? Nope an anti virus would be suffice. However personally i wouldn't get an internet security suite, rather i would get separate tools to perform each different functionality<br>  <br>  Anti virus - AVG 8.0 or Avira AntiVir<br>  Spyware/malware - Spybot: Search and destroy<br>  <br>  That would be all, hope you dont find me too lengthy.|`|vFenaoM6aa	dvd rw - a dvd burner, needed if you wish to read and/or burn onto dvds.<br>  Hard drive - needed to install operating system on, and where you store all your files on the computer.<br>  <br>  2. cooler and thermal compound assists cooling of the cpu and other chips. You should have both. thermal compound goes between chip and cooler/heatsink as it's know to transfer the heat to the cooler. Usually the stock coolers have a thermal tape already there which may be adequate.<br>  <br>  3 antivirus helps defend against viruses, Internet security i would assume is a firewall which gives you control of what programs may have access to the internet. Both is helpful, but no means required. Learn to browse safely, i don't even use an antivirus anymore.<br>  free ones, you could use AVG free, and sygate personal firewall for xp.

Htgj1LL6aa	good build, id upgrade to a more reliable board though, like the gigabyte p45. im sure you have sen the one im talking about, you seem to have done your homework. other than that id say those parts are exactly what i would have chosen. most people still think the 9800 gtx+ is the best bang for the buck, but no ati 4870 has the crown now, with recent price drops and all. the reason i say get the gigabyte is because its more reliable than that particular asus, and since overclocking is so easy on the p45+e8400, where all you have to do is change the fsb to get 3.8, id say that is the better option. maybe a pick a cpu cooler though. and i wont settle for less than thermaltake on power supply's because unreliable ones can kill your system, not that im saying ocz is that way.<br>  <br>  to above^ ram is expensive because he wants to overclock, and oc'ing is limited by ram. he will need quality. and needing 8 gb of it really isnt needed for games. id say based on his specs hes building best value for price. quad isnt really needed and its hard to find games that would push a oc'd core 2 to its limits. i doubt there will be any anytime soon. i run all my games just fine an 1.5 gigs with a amd 4800 oc'd to 2.8 and i only use about half my cpu power. and core 2 almost doubles the performance i get clock for clock.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Looks good. All the parts should fit together without compatibility issues. Great build. The RAM is a tad on the expensive side, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  Also you might want to look into a quad-core for the same price. More games are starting to utilize 4 cores, and if you overclock it should match an E8400.|`|38LXFX1saa	They're looking great!

IbxhRebgaa	If you're on an asymmetric connection such as ADSL or most CATV connections, then it will slow down your download slightly. <br>  <br>  To maximize your downtream, try limiting your upstream to about 80 percent of your maximum upstream that your line can support. <br>  <br>  If possible, you should set your upload limit back to `No Limit` after you finish downloading, so that you can seed back at full speed.<br>  <br>  If you're on SDSL or some kind of symmetric fibre, then it probably won't make any difference.
vhlIB9mHaa	The trick would be to edit the string before you send it to the function (or right in the beginning of the check function). Use this to remove all spaces:<br>  <br>  s=s.replace(" ", "");<br>  <br>  Also, I changed the variable b to just subtract 1 from length to match a.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! :)

3d6bn4Qzaa	Any basic $1.59 microphone will work.  If yours is not working, then you are doing something wrong and it is not the microphone at fault.  As a suggestion, stray away from any microphones that require their own driver or software to be installed; you should be looking for a microphone that does not require any software or driver to be installed, more specifically, you should look for a basic, $1.59 analog microphone.  <br>  <br>  Microphones are analog devices that you plug into analog audio ports; when you apply a voltage to the microphone and then excite the potentiometer, it alters the voltage detected in the sound card.  It is quite possibly the simplest part ever made for a computer.|`|5ZqCJFoBaa	go to future shop, best buy, staples or wal mart or anywhere. you can get kinds like this : <a href="http://www.shopjcs.ca/images/Logitech_Desktop_Microphone.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.shopjcs.ca/images/Logitech_De...</a> . they cost only like 20$<br>  <br>  or you can get a simple headset one from the same stores around the same price.

NO I'M KIDDING..REALY. i hope this works out  and the pictures dont get seen good luck.  <br>  <br>  <br>  and if they do get out, i know it seems like the end of the world but it's not.it will blow over and you'll have a good story to tell someday :)<br>  <br>  hmm..are there bad pics of her on there? who has the originals?|`|ZqXUduJMaa	Sorry, but you are out of luck.

You can take this to court if she does. Besides if that girl knew you were trying to hack into the account. She would have already done it before you could even hack in. Also do you have the whole story? If you have a part in this then I this drama is never going to end am I rite. I've been though this kinda phase, girls are bitches at times. If you wanna fight back you have to have everything perfect. Get you information ready, and I know this is going to sound really crazy. Even for me I probably would do it and get it over with no matter how much I am going to regret it. But I think you should tell your parents. For reals I mean its better then being a porn star online right? Rather having naked, dirty, or whatever u guys took haunt you in the future right? If you do tell they will give u tha lecture and all the bull no teenager would eva want to hear. I know I wouldn't but I would rather sit their and pretend I give a **** to what my parents are saying then to be haunted by what this ***** is trying to do to you.<br>  <br>  THE ***** WAY<br>  <br>  Then there this you could make up and be friends. Even if you don't want to you could suck it up and then after the whole **** is over delete those pictures and then be whatever kind of a ***** you want to be.

As long as I am aware of the virus, it is removed by AIMFix<br>  <br>  If you are concerned with the authenticity or safety of downloading AIMFix, I refer you to the  "100% free" award AIMFix has garnered multiple times from Softpedia download archive, which certifies it free of all malware (viruses, trojans, and spyware). I have also created a users page  where you can see a list of universities and organizations that use AIMFix. You can also search Google for my name or for AIMFix (or AIMFix) and you will find the millions of people who have been helped by AIMFix, as well as the dozens of Universities that officially support and recommend it.

Now connect one end of the cut wire to the switch. Connect the other end to the other terminal of the switch. <br>  <br>  If power goes through one side of the wire, it stops at the switch. <br>  If the switch is in the Off position, no power goes through. (Because there's no connection made inside the switch)<br>  <br>  If the switch is in the On position, power goes through to the other wire.<br>  <br>  Hence no need for a +/- sign, on the connection for a switch, on a motherboard.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  PS. Don't forget to put the CD that came with the motherboard, in FIRST! <br>  <br>  Then the Operating System disk.

02fc2d8b37f9d03fbf1bd30319a9d27eaa	hello<br>  <br>  is SuSE free? nope, SuSE is the commercial Linux of Novell and is not available (on a permanent basis) for free; you can test it for one month (30 days) and then you lose access to support (and online updates) unless you buy a license.<br>  <br>  openSUSE is the free alternative, with (nearly) unlimited access to online update repositories (currently, the oldest release that can be updated online is 10.3, which came out two and a half year ago; if you have a production system which you setup on that release, that's unacceptably short period to have to proceed with a major upgrade (change of version BEFORE the comma / dot) but for home users who get everything for free...)<br>  <br>  personally i have been using openSUSE 10.3 as my (primary) home OS for the last two and a half year; no other Linux distribution installed on the PC i had back then (a dual processor server motherboard) so (open-)SUSE was the only alternative to M@kes$h!t v!$t0. meanwhile i have a new PC on which most distro install fine, but i haven't found one which would offer all the ease of use (open-)SUSE does; see for example the package repositories list <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories" rel="nofollow">http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_P...</a> or the download page <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/" rel="nofollow">http://software.opensuse.org/</a> .<br>  <br>  funnily enough i took the zegeniestudios.net and it advised me to use Slackware; even being an IT professional i wouldn't choose slackware considering that it is a distro where one can (has to) compile most things oneself.<br>  <br>  so, short answer: openSUSE is free and you can get it from <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/" rel="nofollow">http://software.opensuse.org/</a> ; there is also the possibility to download either DVD with torrent if you don't have a mega bandwidth.|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	you can download it from the link below<br>  <br>  There are a better Linux distribution available that you should look at.. which are more superior in many ways.|`|420WrT5uaa	yes you can run ubuntu on alive CD|`|tQz2HWFdaa	Yes, SUSE is free.

Don't you have a router?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you really want to continue your way, here are my questions/suggestions:<br>  <br>  Are you loading the operating system from the new computer or from the old drive?  You definitely should be starting windows with the newer hard drive (vista i would assume).  If you try to load the old windows in a new computer, the drivers will be incorrect and cause all kinda of conflicts.<br>  <br>  If the computer is booting the drives in the wrong order you need to go into the bios and change the order of the boot options so that vista (new drive) is booting first.<br>  <br>  If you have the old hard drive running and connected to the new computer, it should be as easy as browsing to the old drive within vista when it boots.  you can also try to boot vista in safe mode and try again.  the old drive should be available in "my computer".|`|3d6bn4Qzaa	As a rule, stalling is not a security problem, it's usually a hardware issue.  Persisting hardware issues can cause permanent hardware failures if not treated properly ( and each case is very different ).  <br>  <br>  First of all I have to ask, why don't you just network the two computers and copy the files over the network?  You just need to hook both computers up to a switch/router/hub or together through a crossover cable and follow standard networking and file sharing procedures ( you can ask another question if you want to go that route and cannot figure it out ).  I am assuming at the moment that your old computer is completely broken and this is not an option.  <br>  <br>  I am a bit confused by your description of your hardware setup, so let me just drop all of that and explain what you need to do.  <br>  > Take your old hard drive completely out of your old computer.<br>  > I have my doubts that your new computer does not contain any power plugs compatible with your old drive.  You should be able to gank the 4-pin molex connector ( that's the '4 prong power inlet' ) from your CD-ROM or other optical drive temporarily.  <br>  > Plug in your old drive into your new computer via the IDE 'basic flat cable connector' and the 4-pin molex power connector that you stole from your optical drive.  Unplug the IDE or SATA cable from your optical drive.<br>  > Upon startup you may need to go into the BIOS Setup and disable the optical drive temporarily.  <br>  > Bootup to Windows, copy what you need, then shutdown and re-hook up your optical drive and such and reenable it in the BIOS Setup again.

XmnVJxzaaa	To partially answer your question, your computer uses PCI Express x16 (PCIe x16) graphics cards. Any graphics card you buy should use that interface. It is that newest and fastest graphics card slot.<br>  Even with the exact model of your computer, I am unable fully answers your question. To let you know which of the two cards you list are compatible with your computer, I would need to know the wattage of your computers power supply. The eMachines support website didn't give that information. And knowing the wattage of your power supply is extremely important to deciding if a graphics card is compatible with a computer.<br>  Though I am unable to fully help you, I can give the information that will let you help yourself. Finding out the specification of your power supply is a simple thing. All you have to do is open your case and check the sticker on the side of your power supply. It will look something like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/OCZ/GameXStream700W/images/sticker.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/OCZ/G...</a><br>  Once you have the total watts, you can find a graphics card that will work with your computer.<br>  The ATI Radeon HD 3450 is the better of the two cards you list. The HD 3450 requires a minimum 300 Watt power supply. It is older, but in its day it was a good card. For a few dollars more, the ATI Radeon HD 3650 is MUCH better and also works with a 300 Watt power supply. Just a suggestion.<br>  If you prefer nVidia, a decent PCI Express x16 in the same under $50 category is the nVidia 8500 GT. It is vastly superior to the GeForce FX 5500 you suggest, costs near enough to the same as the FX 5500 and requires a minimum 300 Watt power supply.<br>  I hope this helps. If you need more information, please add more details to this question, or feel free to email me through my Yahoo! Answer profile.<br>  Good luck.

How often have you cleaned out the inside of your computer? An inside of a computer can accumalate a LOT of dust and other debris (once i actually found an ACTUAL mouse nest inside one ) so things COULD be heating up. Try sniffing (yes actually sniffing ) around the computer after you have had it one for a while. Do you smell a sort of acidy type burning smell? Could be your power supply is becoming fried. <br>  Now if you suspect a virus try looking up a program called SUPERantispyware. It has a FREE version, and a pay for version. The NICE thing about this one and why i recommend it to people.. is that the FREE version will not only search for and inform you of anything it finds.. but will REMOVE it! Most of these so called free ones.. only informs you, and you have to purchase the programs before they will remove them. Hope these helps!
HYedOEbnaa	just change your boot order to cd.  make sure your xp cd is in the cd drive and press any key when told.  You will get the part where you can create and delete partitions.  Just delete everything that is there.  Now your hard drive is completely clean. no vista or anything, for here you can create a partition or just have one drive.  Then it is just a matter of following directions from there.  When you do this i suggest that you turn off automatic updates until you are ready to start updating.  Like after virus protection is installed, all your drivers stuff like that.  Then turn on automatic updates when you are ready|`|KBaeecQzaa	put the xp cd on the cd drive, reboot your computer, boot it from the cdrom, press a key to boot up, windows xp setup will load, let it to fully load, in the format screen, choose the partition, format it using ntfs (not quick), let it to copy all the installation files, it will reboot, and the xp setup wizard will begin, follow all the instructions

And in the stanza menu select Tools > Allow Sharing with the book open.<br>  <br>  The open stanza on your iPod and in the library goto shared books.  (your wifi must be on). The book will be there, download it.<br>  <br>  That is the best way I have found, plus Stanza is a great iPod app.  Custom bookmarks, nice catalog system, and direct connection download to the Gutenburg Project where you will find over 25,000 free classic ebooks you can download directly to your iPod.
0a1Byhljaa	Ok here we go.<br>  <br>  make sure your TV has a VGA port on the back.  Its a blue port with 15 holes on it separated into 3 lines.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/VGA_port.jpg/800px-VGA_port.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  Now your computer must also have a VGA port.  But here is the catch.  If you are also going to have a monitor, you need TWO VGA ports on your computer, one to connect to monitor to, an the other for the TV.<br>  <br>  You can also get a computer with a DVI port for your monitor, but make sure your monitor has an DVI port. <br>  <br>  in this case you would have one VGA for TV, and DVI for monitor.<br>  <br>  Heres some help <br>  <a href="http://images10.newegg.com/UploadFilesForNewegg/itemintelligence/VideoCard/Graphics_Card_Interfaces.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://images10.newegg.com/UploadFilesFo...</a><br>  <br>  Wheer to buy?  Newegg.com<br>  Cables really cheap.  for DVI port you need DVI cable, for VGA port you need VGA cable<br>  Simple.<br>  <br>  cables should cost only around 30 dollars for decent ones.  Maybe less.  It depends what length you need<br>  <br>  It really does not matter. DVI is just better quality.  I don't think there are many TVs out there with DVI cable so don't go down that path<br>  <br>  You can find tutorials how to do this stuff by searching google.<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=connect+TV+to+computer&sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B2GGFB_en___US232" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=connect+T...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck. :)|`|0TCztPZBaa	ok here goes....now you can hook up any Pc to any tv provided you have an S-Video connection and or ( flat screen with a VGA hook up) No (#2) Right now all the computers are entirely equipped with what your asking (except w/ HDMI con) As for the computer I would recommend a Gateway* ( As far as cable you would need an S-Video cable approx.5.00) <br>  I would take you step by step , however I  am running out of room and Im sorry I could only answer 4 out of 7 of your questions <br>  I I don't know what else to say email me i guess.......|`|1HGdktCpaa	Ok, I don't like Dells, haha, I would suggest building your own PC because you can make a great gaming PC under $500. (I made mine January last year for $500, and it plays COD5) If you don't know how, than I guess Dell would be a choice. <br>  <br>  When your getting a TV, make sure it either has a VGA or DVI input (It will say in the description). Thats it. All PC's will hook up to a TV with a VGA or DVI input just fine. Heres an example of a TV with a VGA input (as noted in the "Inputs" section of the description) <br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3887598&CatId=3649" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a><br>  ANY PC (made within the last 8 years haha) will hookup to this just like any other monitor.<br>  <br>  As for where to get all your stuff, I reccomend TigerDirect, they have fast shipping and great prices. Another one would be NewEgg, they are also a good company. If you don't want it shipped, go to Walmart, its always cheap. Costco is really good for TVs, but you have to a member.<br>  <br>  Cables would be any ordinary monitor cable, probably the one your using now would work. <br>  <br>  Its about as easy as setting up a normal PC to a normal monitor!|`|eGINMIGmaa	See if this helps:<br>  NO, you don't need a special TV. All you need is this special cord from RadioShack.  It connects the PC tower to the back of the TV so that it can use the TV as a monitor.  You can get it for like 10 bucks.<br>  radioshack.com<br>  <br>  It depends on what you're going to use it for, and how often. If you want to take the computer with you, you could get a laptop.  I just got a new acer Aspire for my birthday, and I love it. here's a link to it:<br>  <a href="http://microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0306098" rel="nofollow">http://microcenter.com/single_product_re...</a><br>  <br>  Here's an estimate (APPROXIMATE!):<br>  Computer:    300-500<br>  Cord:               10-20<br>  TV:                    500<br>  -------------------------------<br>  TOTAL:            $920<br>  <br>  As for stores, you can get most if not all  of that stuff at places like Microcenter, Best Buy, and Circuit City (even though they're closing).  Look around on places like Amazon.com for some deals, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you need more help, add more details|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	First off, Dell's are terrible. The computers are overpriced for what you get and they load them with lots of crap. I'd advise learning how to build your own system, and doing it, you'll save a lot of money.<br>  <br>  As for PC->TV, your best bet would be to get a TV that supports HDMI, and buying a video card for your PC that has an HDMI output.<br>  <br>  www.newegg.ca or .com, depending on where you live, would be your best choice for prices.|`|RUmNeAqYaa	get an s video cord and plug one end to your computer then the other to your tv

Antivirus 360, Spyware Guard 2008, Antivirus 2009 and many similar sounding programs are versions of the smitfraud virus. Most popular AntiVirus programs have trouble with it. There is a specific tool to address this problem. You can run it in search mode first to make sure that this is the problem.<br>  <br>  Go to this link:<br>  <a href="http://siri.geekstogo.com/SmitfraudFix.php" rel="nofollow">http://siri.geekstogo.com/SmitfraudFix.p...</a><br>  Download smitfraudfix.exe<br>  Run it in safe mode in a command prompt window.<br>  <br>  Don't ever click on a popup "antivirus warning" unless the name of a program you have already installed is in the title area a the top of the window. Close the pop up from the taskbar by right clicking the taskbar entry for the pop up window and clicking close.<br>  <br>  Command Prompt<br>  Start > Run <br>  type command <br>  click enter <br>  or<br>  Start > Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt<br>  <br>  Drag the file icon into the Command Prompt window. The entire file path should appear. <br>  Hit enter to run.<br>  <br>  Safe mode<br>  Restart the machine.<br>  Press F8 before the Windows StartUp screen appears.<br>  The boot choices menu should appear.<br>  Press the number for the safe mode option.|`|dcd11iUwaa	yea its a virus<br>  wipe the system off and start again<br>  <br>  very hard to get rid of.|`|DjMAhvpvaa	That totally sucks!

If this does not help, press Ctrl, Alt, and<br>  Delete keys all at the same time. If a programs screen appears, select end task and left click your mouse one time. If another screen appears select end task and left click your mouse one more time. Hopefully your mission is accomplished with this five second procedure. <br>  Step2<br>  If step one worked for you, you'll probably have to do it again each time you connect to the Internet, but only once per visit, until you go into your computer and delete this file that keeps popping up from your computer. <br>  Step3<br>  If the above procedure is working for you, great. However, they may return again as invisible pop ups. When you're computer appears to be stalling for longer than normal, try the above procedure again, to see if the same program screen reappears. (Invisible pop ups are done away with in the same manner). <br>  Step4<br>  If the procedure mentioned above did not help, disconnect from the Internet. Press Start, then control panel, then Internet preferences.<br>  Delete cookies and search history. <br>  Step5<br>  If the above attempts were not enough, delete the user name and use<br>  another one. <br>  Step6<br>  If the above attempts were not enough yet, you should ran an anti-spyware software ,then clean your registry make it faster.<br>  Recommend:<br>  Scan your Spyware/Adaware<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|trpKZ1JXaa	dont download or buy an ativirus that forces and promots you to buy itself on ur pc. im sure it is rogue spyware that acts as a fake anti virus program and just collects money from ursers and runs aways. thats a scam. this fake antivirus appeared with following names, ANTIVIRUS 2009, ANTIVIRUS 360, ANTIVIRUS 2010, MS ANTISPYWARE, XP ANTIVIRUS, VIRUS RESPONSE LAB, ULTRA VIRUS REMOVE and even more, you should remove this virus manualy tthat shows itself a antivirus, here ya go to remove it <a href="http://darfuns.com/fake-antivirus-2009-removal/" rel="nofollow">http://darfuns.com/fake-antivirus-2009-r...</a><br>  Good Luck|`|26pU02cDaa	Try to restart your computer.

Htgj1LL6aa	ok do not for any reason use a software overclocking utility at all. always do it through the bios if you can. i use a overclock program, but i only change my fsb. <br>  <br>  you will need a great cooler. also you will need ram at 1066 mhz to get a good overclock. overclocking goes by your rams frequency speed. if i have a core 2 duo e8400, and the multiplier is 10 x 400 then i have a clock of 4.0 ghz. my ram is 800mhz ram dual channel. since the fsb is 400 my ram is required to have 800 mhz because it is dual channel, it needs to be able to use that fsb speed X 2. so from that you can see that i cannot overclock any higher. if i had 1066 speed ram, i could set my fsb to 533 because im limited to 533 X 2 because of the ram speed. i would look at many guides on how to di this before you do anything because if you dont you can fry your set up in seconds. get thermal paste and a big heatsink and fan if you want high speeds.|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	if you dont know how to do it, DONT do it. you can fry your motherboard very east|`|i5JpCDG5aa	This link should help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/f7/cpu-overclocking-software-43139/" rel="nofollow">http://club.cdfreaks.com/f7/cpu-overcloc...</a><br>  <br>  You can use a program in your OS

Just make sure it says working properly. Even if it does or does not click on the "Driver" tab near the top. Finally click on "Update Driver.." and it should check the internet for any driver updates for your Wireless Internet Adapter. If not just get the name of it and google it. Try and find it on its manufacturers website and manually download the driver for it and run it. <br>  <br>  If this doesnt help try contacting your Laptops manufacturers support line if its still under warranty. If not take it in to BestBuy or a local repair shop.|`|JikpvGcXaa	To troubleshoot the issue: Right click my computer > go to the advanced tab > click the "settings..." button in the Startup and Recovery section. > In the system failure section, UNcheck "Automatically restart"<br>  <br>  This will stop your computer from restarting when it gets a BSOD, allowing you to write down the error codes and troubleshoot the issue.

Ve3RGbM9aa	What you are describing could be related to one of two things. Currently the ABC player works in both IE and Firefox (still wont work in chrome) The main thing you want to make sure is that you have the latest version of Flash player installed on your computer. Its a plug in that allows you to view certain interactive content online (such that of the player). Each browser uses a different plug in, so you would be required to download it for each individual web browser. <br>  <br>  You will find this here: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplaye...</a><br>  <br>  Usually you are promted to download it anytime you encounter content which requires it (if you dont already have it)<br>  <br>  The othere thing i can think of is your network. Depending where you are or what your settings are, you may be blocked from certain content. This is especially true in work places and public areas. If you are at home it really shouldnt be an issue. <br>  <br>  One thing i can recomend is to unisnstall and reinstall your web browser. This will reset everything to a default. Just make sure you save your bookmarks (if you value them) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Cheers ^_^

Htgj1LL6aa	your pc is considered out of date by most peoples standards, but really your just fine for anything. i have a 4800 x2 and 1.5 gigs of ram with a 8800gt vid card. i run cod4, gears of war, left 4 dead, oblivion with mods that replace the 1024x1024 textures with 4096x4096 textues, and just about any game that isnt crysis on max settings with solid fps. i only utilize about half my cpu at the most. amd's are good for gaming. intel is better but you have enough juice if you got the right video card. you did not specify a video card however so i assume you do not have one. the absolute best bang for your buck right now is not the 9800gtx+ for 150. it is the ati 4870 512 card from sapphire on newegg.com for 164$ with a 15 mail in rebate. a 4870 is about 150% or more of that gtx+ for the same price. im sure you have a pci express x16 or maybe a 2.0 slot, but make sure before you get a video card. to run most games at decent settings and resolutions you want atleast a 9600gt, but a 9800gt is probably the best minimum grade card you should consider, but again for the price, the 4870 is just dollars away and that will run everything you want on very high, taking into account you play on 17-22 inch monitors like the rest of the real world. your ram is good enough i have only 1.5 and its 266 mhz :/ so im sure yours is much faster. <br>  <br>  also if you had the desire you could overclock that pc if you used ntune form nvidia. i would not do this if you could overclock in your bios, but if you have a dell, or a hp, you cannot unless you can flash your bios to the manufacturers default bios. if you use ntune to do it, only change the fsb, do not mess with memory timings or any kind of voltages unless you know what your doing.|`|lcchJUuCaa	its okay. you have a descent processor.<br>  ram wise you could use another gig or two <br>  <br>  and then it depends on your video card|`|d13ffb64b199e16801c20c68edf7e132aa	I gues CPU is alright but you should put in more ram.

Htgj1LL6aa	i dont know if i got some kind of freak card from bfg but. i have a 8800gt oc2. it comes from bfg at 675 mhz vs. 600 stock. i can oc it to 760 along with just as much of an increase on my memory and shaders. and it runs 100% stable and no more than 65c. im sure a 9800gt will do even better, because the only difference is its 55 nm. mine is 65nm. meaning hypothetically you will be able to overclock more and use less power. but then again like i said im sure i just got a realy great card, and even though i dont need water cooling on mine, if i did have it it wouldnt make a difference anyway because i cant see stability after 770 mhz, and it runs cool enough on air.<br>  but as far as i know the cards are suposed to be exactly the same. but then again 8800gt's have the whole card covered with that metal plate. 9800gt's do not. take a look at the pics of the backside and see if the screws line up with your 9800. because the back on the 8800gt's is bare.  8800 gt's have 12 screws.

XYOYml59aa	Hi, if you mean USB then yes you can add more storage space. If you mean ram, then no that can't be added unless you open the computer up. <br>  ram is what make the computer usually work faster (not that it increases it speed, but it gives it more space to work with so it isn't slowed down when it comes to that part)<br>  <br>  if you just want more space to save stuff to, external hard drives are fine. Just a note, external hard drives shouldn't really be used how you use a computer. They are fine to store stuff on, once in awhile get the stuff. External hard drives typically run hotter and i burns the hard drive out faster than in a computer. Not saying you shouldn't use it all the time, this is more just a warning that it MAY (some can last a really long time, others wont, just chance really) not last as long as you expect/want it to.<br>  <br>  newegg.com is a great place to buy stuff like this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=414&name=External-Hard-Drives" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory....</a><br>  <br>  You can also buy a hard drive and by an external enclosure which would make the same things as i posted above. <br>  <br>  any computer store or stores that sell computer stuff by you would sell these things also. If you just need a little bit of room 2 to 4GB and under I would say go with a flash drive, they are a lot easier to carry around and can be helpful for that way. <br>  <br>  On more thing, you should have XP, so usb would be fne, if not, you have to be more careful, a lot of operating systems before XP are being completely unsupported (like Windows 98 is getting hard to find anything for now, still stuff, just limited). This is just a side note really, you can never assume anything so that is what I'm trying to do here.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Additional memory needs to be installed inside your computer on the main board.<br>  <br>  picture <a href="http://www.primerpc.com/hardware/memorytypesS.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.primerpc.com/hardware/memoryt...</a><br>  <br>  there is a USB device called an external hard disk drive that adds storage for your files and they come in different sizes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.tigerdirect.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/fantom-hard-drive.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://news.tigerdirect.com/wp-content/u...</a><br>  <br>  So, for adding memory, you should talk with a technician, and for adding a USB hard drive, you can buy one (at best buy for example) and just plug it in.

Are you hooked in through cable or DSL?   Check the fine print and make sure that you are allowed to run a server.  Assuming you are -- here's the next question?  Does your service provider give you a static or dynamic IP address?<br>  <br>  If its static, you're good to go.  Dynamic?   No worries.   Just hook up with DyDns.org  They can track your changing IP address for you and map it to something static.<br>  <br>  One word of warning.... It can be a jungle out there on the net.

Leave a message and you will get a reply back that day.<br>  What you must understand is the fact that we have 1000's of new customers every single month. With that many people you end up with a few cases once in a wile where people's spam filter will block our emails and they will think we are avoiding them. <br>  We do everything you can to have great support and the main reason that things don't work out is that people don't use the support systems we recommend. (our www.InternetSupportSite.com and our support number 866-757-6021) use either of these and you will be taken care of right away. <br>  The problem happens when people try to email us and the email ISP's block our emails.

That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.<br>  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist. <br>  <br>  You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.<br>  <br>  Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://nshop1.com/3/" rel="nofollow">http://nshop1.com/3/</a><br>  <br>  -Unblock ANY Website<br>  -watch youtube videos<br>  -download up to 100 MB<br>  -hide you IP and stay anonymous<br>  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server<br>  <br>  I get new proxies here everyday:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxies">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if it's not working and i'll email you a proxy that I haven't advertised yet|`|jE41oKZIaa	Try these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://surfbros.info" rel="nofollow">http://surfbros.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://webvisa.info" rel="nofollow">http://webvisa.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://netrover.info" rel="nofollow">http://netrover.info</a><br>  <br>  <a href="https://proximize.me" rel="nofollow">https://proximize.me</a>|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Hows your grades and NO NOT A SECURITY QUESTION|`|xSupIHLJaa	you can try  these proxy:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.timemove.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.timemove.com</a><br>  <a href="http://web.orangest.org" rel="nofollow">http://web.orangest.org</a><br>  www.1hour.info<br>  www.keepme.info<br>  www.ktunnel.com<br>  <br>  <br>  You can also join this group to receive fresh proxies every week in your email inbox :<br>  <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/listproxyku/join">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/listp...</a>|`|6JeIhhDiaa	I am on this one right now.<br>  It works fabulous!<br>  <br>  <a href="https://wildproxy.net" rel="nofollow">https://wildproxy.net</a>|`|1alUsemJaa	www.mp3tunnel.com<br>  www.vtunnel.com<br>  or try typing in <a href="https://www.(whatever" rel="nofollow">https://www.(whatever</a> website you need unblocked)<br>  hope that helps!|`|wGCCMjVsaa	rxproxy.com<br>  <br>  www.hidemyass.com<br>  <br>  proxydom.com|`|4lfHX2mqaa	check out this one www.responsiblepast.cn|`|ImaqgQEDaa	www.atunnel.com|`|ZkELw9wzaa	Your school's filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack their security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school's network.

tsBL19qzaa	If you are talking about a US government security clearance. The only way you can get one is if you are hired by some company/US gov, e.g,, military, Intel agency, etc, and the position that you are hired for requires one. So, if the hiring body is willing to get a clearance for you, then the process starts to determine whether you get a clearance (extensive back ground investigation). Once the investigation process is completed, all of the info gets sent before an adjudication board, and they either say yes or no. If, they say yes, you have a clearance, if they say no, then you probably no longer have a job, unless the hiring body has jobs requiring no clearance.<br>  <br>  You cannot get a US gov. security clearance on your own.<br>  <br>  Clearences are good x amount of time. It depends on what kind you get, e.g., confdential, secret, top secret, top secret with special compartment intel, etc.<br>  <br>  Each requires renewal every so may years.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Depending on were you live you need to get a criminal record check done and that involves getting your fingerprints done, you can have no criminal record or your outta luck i used to work in the field.

Using your wireless connection manager (the little pc icon that has little wireless symbols) in the lower right corner of your screen (assuming a windows OS) see if you can see his router name (SSID).  If you can see his router and you maintain 3 bars or more, you do not need a repeater.<br>  <br>  The issue is going to be how far away is the neighbor.  You can also ask your friend to set the broadcast channel to 9, 10 or 11.  The automatic setting usually hits the lower channels.  This will reduce interference from other routers and increase the distance - performance of his / her rounter.|`|HgW2Zwxqaa	You would need to have a "repeater" wireless router that would repeat their connection from their wireless router to yours.

So it shouldn't take long to do.<br>  <br>  If you can't bypass it then go ahead and upgrade.
