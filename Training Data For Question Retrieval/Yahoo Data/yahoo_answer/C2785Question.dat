20081003005607AA7GmfM	Dining Out;United States;Dallas	What's a good relaxed bar in Dallas?	I'm taking my girlfriend on a getaway weekend to Dallas, TX, in a few weeks.  I'm planning the weekend, and one thing I want to do is take her to a bar.  But i'm looking for a nice, relaxed, more on the quiet side bar.  Somewhere where the two of us can sit, chat, drink, maybe smoke, and not have to yell to hear each other.  We are staying at a hotel on Stemmens, so I would prefer a bar somewhat close by, as we probably will need to take a cab or something so we aren't driving back drunk.       Anyone have any suggestions?
