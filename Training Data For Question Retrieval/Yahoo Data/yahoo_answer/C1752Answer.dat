Michael Jackson is one of the highest donators to charity. He was listed in the 2000 edition of the Guiness Book Of World Records for breaking the world record for the "Most Charities Supported By a Pop Star". It states that Michael Jackson has supported 39 charity organizations either with monetary donations through sponsorships of their projects or by participating in their silent auction. To anyone after tickets, good luck.|`|psvPoJHKaa	I'm not certain but start by registering your mums number on the o2 priority list. <a href="http://www.o2blueroom.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.o2blueroom.co.uk/</a><br>  Then put her number in and register under her name.<br>  It says that you are a o2 priority and they go on sale wednesday 7am.<br>  Hopefully it will let you on wednesday, if not try friday for general sale.<br>  I have just also registered because i want michael jackson tickets, Good Luck ! :D<br>  <br>  <br>  And also , i think they should have atleast 10,000 presale tickets.

Besides according to the news warming is not good either because the interpret it to be global warming. Global warming is not caused by man, the theory that it is is just political propaganda. The economy is not as bad as being reported either because that is propaganda also. The current majority in the government today do nt want good news because when things are good they lose power. They rule by fear and intimidation and as long as they can keep your afraid you will keep voting them in because they claim hug large big government is the answer.<br>  <br>  the news media have a political agenda and fair and accurate unbiased reporting has died.

As for President Obama, he is instilling the opposite - hope in the future.<br>  <br>  It will take some time, but he will dig the fear out of the pit that Bush has done.  <br>  <br>  It is rather interesting, that millions will see hope when listening to Obama and yet some, like you, only hear and see the fear.

Sometimes, neighbours don't want to interfere, which may be another reason for the child's neglect going unreported.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, people do report incidents of child neglect, but are disbelieved, or ignored. there was a case several years ago, also in Russsia, of a little boy called Edik, who was also abandoned by his alcoholic mother and raised by dogs. Several neighbours tried to raise the alarm, but were told by police that there was nothing wrong with the boy and they were over reacting. Eventually, the boy and his sister were found and taken into care. Edik was found to have developed the ways of dogs, even barking and growling instead of speaking ( he was abandoned at age 1 and found aged around 4). This meant that the poor boy was left with very little speech, and little if any chance of learning to speak.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, relatives actually become involved in the mistreatment of children. believing that they're acting in the child's best interests, or having been threatened into colluding with the abusive parent.|`|q5BkV27Daa	I saw a documentary on something similar last year.

This correction caused people who overextended their ability to pay to go into foreclosure on their homes.  This was both the fault of the lenders and the homeowners.<br>  <br>  The problem was compounded by the government (Republicans and Democrats, Bush administration and now Obama administration) panicking.  The bailouts have done nothing to help the economic situation but has actually made it worse because of the increased national debt and the inevitable result of higher taxes.<br>  <br>  Are we headed for  a depression?  I think it is too early to tell.  It may depend on how much more bloated spending packages the government decides to implement.

Tw0V3FGYaa	Here is his web site, maybe there is a station guide there somewhere, or listen through the net. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://michaelsavage.wnd.com" rel="nofollow">http://michaelsavage.wnd.com</a>
54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Michael Savage plays the part of the Gadfly, irritating the people into greater awareness and influencing them to take action.  This is not always a job for the courteous, and the Gadfly does not generally expect overt gratitude. Like Diogenes the Cynic, the Gadfly is content to point out what needs to be noticed.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	it must be because enough people subscribe to his statements.<br>  unless he is running for an office he can speak his mind and not BS.|`|uoZIYhJtaa	He's just a loud mouth scumbag and being like he is is the only way he can attract a limited audience...an audience that likes the crap he spouts out.<br>  <br>  My suggestion....just don't listen to him. You lose brain cells when you do.|`|Atcn9M3iaa	Because he' a clown whose job is to entertain the sticky syrup that makes up the mass of Republican voters.
LX0vjwXPaa	Um not sure exactly what the question is.  I would imagine that the author (if such is not the poster) is taken in by propaganda and doesn't truly understand the world around him.<br>  <br>  1)  We're NOT on the brink of losing our country, for cripes sake.  People keep bringing up the Great Depression.  For all that is holy, look at the FACTS.  Today, people are upset because they can't get a new car, new house, etc.  During the depression, people wanted some FOOD.  They didn't want their mortgage paid for, their utilities, they freakin wanted something to EAT.<br>  2)  The average home-brewed american used to be ashamed if they couldn't pay their bills.  Now they're lining up for handouts, trashing houses they lose, say they have "this right" or "that right" because the banks are "evil greedy rich people".  No responsibility, no accountability.  <br>  3) Obama TRULY cleaning up THE mess would probably lose him the next election.  The democrat/socialist agenda is to give handouts to the masses, who then in their gratitude will vote for those that "helped them".  All it truly is is highlighting how SELFISH America has gotten.  You cannot fix this economy by blaming the "rich people" and punishing them MORE by raising taxes HIGHER.  They'll eventually just LEAVE.  Until they decide to bag out though, they'll just pass the additional taxes on to the masses, who don't even SEE that's what happens.  The result:  the "average joe" is happy he paid no taxes and got a $2k tax return to blow on cigs and beer, but paid $4k more in expenses that year because gas/beer/groceries/etc went up $50.  yeeeeeeeah!|`|LSxBwiFSaa	I say- you're Absolutely Right... [It's only that your Grammar needs alittle "work..."]. Time tells the Truth.  :)|`|Tw0V3FGYaa	I don't agree with anything you said.|`|iAjtPeOkaa	That's a racist question.
iAjtPeOkaa	It should not be.|`|fFq68dJYaa	I don't smoke pot myself. But legalizing marijuana opens the door to use it  for non-drug related purposes. It is a great material to make paper - cheap, long-lasting, durable and ecologically clean.|`|AA10527991	I don't smoke it anymore, but I think the main reason we should legalize it is for the tax revenue that can be realized by governments.|`|i1AsTUG0aa	I think that in some cases it should be legalized. For example, in California it hass been proposed that marijuana be legalized and heavily taxed. It would help California bring itself out of a billion dollar debt, but restrictions similar to those for alcohol would be formed, such as DUI, being high in public, etc.|`|mbfMYmzWaa	I'm not a smoker/user of anything apart from alcohol... but I think it should definitely be legal.<br>  <br>  1stly, if the government keeps making all these things illegal, then when do you think they'll draw the line? next goes the deadly tobacco, then alcohol dies, and hey, too much steak is dangerous- causing coronary blockages and what not... so beef's then over... eventually they'll have to rule out tomatoes and milk for their carcinogen content, and before we know it we'll be living on cabbage soup and anti-mineralised water. <br>  <br>  2ndly, and perhaaaaps a bit more importantly- I'm not sure about the US laws, but if it's a felony/arrestable offense... then it's putting a HUUUUUGE additional pressure onto the allready overcrowded prisons and holding docks, as well as unnessicarily introducing people to the criminal justice system- which we know (and those of you who don't, should read up on it) is absolutely freakin USELESS at helping rehabilitate people and improving society... which is aparently it's purpose.<br>  <br>  3rdly, it'd look great for whatever government does it... lol... "Crime rates have dropped, 15% in the last year, the BIGGEST decline in the history of mankind.... yadayadayada"   And they wouldn't be losing such a MASSIVE tax revenue which would absolutely give them a kick **** economy boost. More jobs, more tax, more creative, open minded & resourceful citizens. lol. <br>  <br>  4thly, It would allow better regulation, which would then minus out the only argument they have for it's ILLEGALisation in the first place! if it were legal, the legislation can study the effects of TCH (or whatever it is) on people, and therefore minimize the negative impacts. They can put restricitons on how much people will use, and test people for their risk of going skitzo. They can also educate people on how to do it safely, and they can develop safe forms. Overall- it has the potential to become a FAR FAAAR less risky/ healthier drug than smoking tobacco (which also contains the same chemicals as pesticide... yet they're worried about the HERB giving us cognitive problems) <br>  <br>  5thly, there's the same issue with prostitution (only not  as prominent) and that is the whole "underground" industry. The people who are involved with "illicit activities" can't help but live in an ''illicit world'' where murder, blackmail, rape, and all these other ACTUALLY dangerous crimes take place. It's like a whole nother society, and because drugs and prostitution are their main industries... if you took away a big part of their primary industry by legalising marijuana, you'd be snuffing out a decent wad of their livelyhood. <br>  <br>  Lol... I hope it makes sense, I'm overtired, not stoned.|`|4uhyxMnmaa	A government cannot suppress & control anything simultaneously.<br>  <br>  The greatest example is the folly of the US Prohibition.  Alcohol, previously brewed & used, was outlawed & the criminal black market thrived.<br>  <br>  <br>  When Prohibition was revoked & alcohol was again legally available, it's use was restricted & taxed.|`|LX0vjwXPaa	Yes, there is.  I don't smoke it/won't smoke it, but I'd prefer it was legalized.  My main basis:  can't think of a single person who has had a worse experience on marijuana than alcohol.  The whole issue is this:  we can be drunks or tobacco users, even though each kills someone every 19 seconds (or something ridiculous like that); but we can't smoke marijuana of our own accord because we'd become lazy and useless?  Doesn't sound very smart to me.  And with our government the way it is, wouldn't it stand to reason to legalize and tax it (much like cigarettes) to HELP the government w/ money problems instead of fighting it with the "war on drugs"?  Personally, I could care less WHAT someone does as long as it doesn't effect me, and most "stoners" sit at home and do nothing when their stoned.  Alcoholics go drive and kill people, or act stupid in some way, Heroin/Crack addicts steal/kill/wh**e themselves out, etc etc.|`|vife8MOzaa	I think it should be legalized because beer is legal. I don't drink beer or alcohol all that often either, but I wouldn't want anyone to take that right away from me to do so. Same with cigarettes. Watch the movie Grass, it's narrated by Woody Harrelson and it rocks!<br>  <br>  EDIT: hahaha Jonathan, "lazy and useless" that's the problem TODAY, long ago they said it made you violent and crazy! hahaha! Now it's the gateway drug!!! lol it's always been a tool, that's all, a tool for the government|`|yUtwVDzyaa	Reason 1: Your way more likely to do something stupid drunk then you are high.<br>  <br>  Reason 2: Legalizing it will make it more readily available meaning that people will be less enticed to try it, or use it in general.<br>  <br>  Reason 3: If you've ever been around anyone who has ever been high then you know that there is no reason for it to be illegal.|`|cIttXzrwaa	Non-stoner here.  It should be legalized for the tax dollars it could generate.  It is used in the making of many medications and also is valuable in the making of rope.

VSwko9p7aa	Please, what I think we should do is quit our position as world police and instead concentrate on our on border.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	I think you should stop smoking dope.<br>  <br>  It's your drug money that is encouraging the crime.|`|fFq68dJYaa	Not until we are invited by Mexicans. We should, however, reinforce the border from this side.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	Well, prohibition related gang violence has been killing thousands of Americans a year for decades, so it's not like this isn't happening in the USA already. <br>  <br>  Secondly, this violence is being fuelled by the USA drug trade, so if we can't even control our own drug users who are demanding the product supplied by these gangs, how the hell are we going to magically have success doing the same in Mexico?<br>  <br>  Not to mention that we have been unable to control the flow of weapons into Mexico, 90% of the guns used in crime in Mexico were smuggled in from the USA.<br>  <br>  And the army is completely utterly untrained and unprepared fro the mission you want to assign them too.<br>  <br>  Lastly, to put it mildly, this would be about as popular in Mexico as having the Mexican army march into LA to help us with our gang violence problem would be popular in the USA.<br>  <br>  America's drug prohibition policy made this problem in the first place, sending the troops in isn't going to fix it, it will make it worse.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	People are not going to stop smoking pot. Legalization would take lots of money out of the pockets of the drug lords and provide tax revenue for the US which is in debt up to its eyeballs. Pot's not the only drug coming across, but it's a step in the right direction. People are allowed to get high if they drink something, but not smoke something. Where's the sense in that?|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	This should be a collaborative effort between the US and Mexico; in fact, the US should not enter Mexico without invitation, unless in hot pursuit of miscreants.|`|AA11540967	Yes! Show them we mean business.|`|i1AsTUG0aa	I don't think we need to be sending troops into Mexico. I think if we send troops anywhere they should only be directly on the US side of the border stopping illegal smuggling of immigrants, drugs, etc. I agree with the previous answerer that if marijuana was legalized, the drug lords would lose massive amounts of cash, meaning a decreasse in gang violence in Mexico, therefore in the US. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that gang violence and gangs are not all about drugs. They are also about your origins, such as if you are from Northern or Southern Mexico, Colombia, etc.|`|Tw0V3FGYaa	Not yet, but getting ready wouldn't be a bad idea.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	No. Instead a bit of border patrolling might help.|`|iAjtPeOkaa	No way. We don't want any more trouble than we already have.

They complain about everything that Obama does, but rarely offer their plan of a better solution.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	The fear-mongering in the media and by the President is slowing the turn-around down.<br>  Nike really hit on something when they promoted, "just do it".
