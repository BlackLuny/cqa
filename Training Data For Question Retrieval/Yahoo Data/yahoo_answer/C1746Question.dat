20090304104858AAHVwdX	News & Events;Current Events	DO users realise that cyberbullying is a criminal act and should more be done in terms of legislation?	But if the cyberbullying continues, can it lead to a criminal conviction? Bullying is not a specific criminal offence but there are laws that can apply to cyberbullying in terms of harassing, menacing and threatening communications. Cyber bullying could be a criminal offence under a number of laws including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious Communications Act 1988, Communications Act 2003 (s127), Public Order Act 1986, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When cyberbullying takes the form of computer hacking then criminal penalties under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 may apply. The Defamation Acts of 1952 and 1996 also deal with material published on the internet.          do you agree this spells it out quite well and should websites at yahoo do all in their power to ensure this criminally targeting someone is not allowed to happen

Lonely bachelors in the isolated Indian village of Barwaan have long pined for the brides of their dreams on the other side of the Kaimur Hills. For decades their marriage proposals have been shunned because they live so far away that no-one wants to move there.But with the number of bachelors in the village now at 130, they've decided to take matters into their own hands by digging a new road.    Their new 'love highway' will not be an easy ride. The men of Barwaan face back-breaking shifts to clear giant rocks and boulders, cut through solid rock and uproot trees with their bare hands.So far 150 villagers, all farmers, have worked for nine hours a day for two months to carve out two miles of road. They have another two miles to dig for the brides they're convinced will await them on the other side of the mountain.       A local politician, moved by their heartache, has donated money for them to buy some basic tools, but they amount to no more than a few wooden poles and pickaxes.        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnew...

20090304114834AAKYgSc	News & Events;Other - News & Events	Layoff debate..what do you think?	So my co-workers and I are debating about how employees should be lay-off (god forbid that happens), and so I was saying that if the company was losing money and had to cut somewhere, it would be better to make a minor paycut on everyone instead of a certain person or group of people. My co-worker goes on to say that if anybody that would have the most difficult time recovering would be him since he has to pay child support. My answer to that was that everyone has their own financial obligations, and to use a child as an excuse to not get laid-off should not be valid. I gave an example as to say that I have credit card debt. Should someone feel sorry for me and not lay me off because of it? No. Same thing as someone with a family to feed, their reason for survival should not be considered more valid. I believe that work performance and senority should decide who stays and who goes.      So if you were an employer and had to choose which people to lay off, would you consider on their personal financial background or simply their work performance?

Allan and Lorraine Peters, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, claimed to be housebound and unable to walk while getting Incapacity Benefit, Disability Living Allowance and a mobility car each.      The court heard Mr Peters, 56, said on his claim form he suffered from angina, chronic pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, spondylitis and high blood pressure, adding he needed oxygen to be kept in his car and simple tasks like getting dressed were a "nightmare".      His wife was on the highest rate of benefits for her "disability", claiming she suffered a "catalogue" of illnesses, could not leave the house or do anything herself without help and need a nebuliser daily.      In fact she was a site supervisor at the firm - while being paid ï¿¡37,500 in benefits.      The family were caught out when investigators went to their house and seized wage slips - in false names - and a snap of the couple smiling and seemingly pain-free as they boarded a gangplank for a boat trip on a Spanish holiday.      Peters and his son Garry were jailed for nine months for benefit fraud while Lorraine Peters, her brother and another son were all given non-custodial sentences.

WASHINGTON - The District of Columbia is one step closer to receiving full voting rights after the Senate approved a crucial measure that sets the bill on track for congressional approval, but even if the bill becomes law, there are likely to be many legal challenges, according to one law professor.       The bill seems to have to support it needs from both the House and Senate, but there is a chance it can be rejected at the Supreme County. One American University law professor says the conservative court has traditionally not been very friendly on voting rights and political democracy.       "The opponents of the bill say a state is a state is a state. The constitution only allows for states to have representation in the U.S. House," said professor Jamie Raskin. Talkback:   Click Here to Comment on this Story          He says if this bill is signed into law, it will face some challenges within our justice system and will ultimately be a battle between party lines. "The conservatives are going to take the position that you've got to read the rights that citizens have through the prism of this structure of government, and the liberals will say the reverse," said Raskin.       If the bill is enacted, Raskin says all constitutional reviews would take place before the end of 2010. Since the case will take precedence over others, the attorney general will be defending the statute, and chances are, Republicans will also plead their case.       "I imagine that you would find Republican members of the House of Representatives who would claim that their rightful portion of political sovereignty in congress is diluted by virtue of the admission of people who have no constitutional right to be there," said Raskin.       On the other hand, Raskin says proponents argue that the District has already been treated like a state by congress for years. "Congress has exclusive authority over the District of Columbia - an authority that has been interpreted very broadly that gives congress the power to define what goes on with respect to D.C.       There has to be a final vote in the Senate on the bill. The house judiciary committee is expected to review the legislation before it is sent to the full House for a vote.

20090304135817AAPcFCZ	News & Events;Current Events	Pakistani Terrorists, where were they for Musharaf?	Being a British Paky, I do often wonder about the socio-political situation there. I have seen the gap between poverty and ' the life', seen first hand the brazil-esque poverty in the body language of the cramped up pauper with dirty syringes next to him outside the oldest mosque in pakistan.      Zardari didn't want the PM post for socio-economic good, not by a long shot.       IMO his motives weren't even his 8 year arrest in a prison cell. He just wanted to oust Musharaf, the best Pakistani leader in the last 20years. He wanted the top dog post - let him have it. let us see what he can do with it and, going by current events - he can do F*** all.       So far all he has done is instigate further anger amongst the illiterate, manipulated, influential marxian masses, the outcome being civil terrorism; on a different scale do these "terrorists" work now, judged by a different measure they are now indeed. Zardari, the civil economy thief, has managed to get a $9.2Bn loan from the IMf for national economic construction to the vital infrastructure of the country.       Any end in sight for those who want to read this? I only see a bloody future, a weak leader who's also a thief [Bhutto paid the mortal price for principal the theft]      So, i wonder, why were these terrorists not internally active under musharaf? Why have they chosen Zardari? Where is Nawar Sharif?       All this stuff about democracy in Pakistan doesn't agree with me. It's best left to be ruled by the military, out of the hands of mucky politicians and those bourgeoisie who are at the mercy of the wealthy land owners in the feudal areas.      Out with Zardari, in with me!
