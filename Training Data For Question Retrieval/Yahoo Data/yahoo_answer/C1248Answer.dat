kUCVLuTPaa	SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the most commonly prescribed of all antidepressant drugs. They include citalopram (brand name Celexa), paroxetine (>Paxil), fluoxetine (>Prozac), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and sertraline (>Zoloft). Doctors also prescribe SSRIs for people with other conditions including anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and certain types of nerve pain.<br>  <br>  Stopping SSRIs suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flu-like symptoms, sleep disturbances, anxiety, tremor, and irritability. These problems affect up to 31 percent of people who suddenly stop taking SSRIs. Withdrawal symptoms are most common with paroxetine, and less common with sertraline. Fluoxetine does not cause these withdrawal symptoms, because it remains in the body for a long time after you stop taking it.<br>  <br>  You'll usually notice withdrawal symptoms one to three days after your last dose of an SSRI, and they may last for up to two weeks. Slowly decreasing your drug dose over the final one or two weeks you take it may help decrease or prevent some of these unpleasant effects. Talk to your doctor before you stop taking an SSRI. Your doctor can determine if it's appropriate for you to quit taking the medicine and help you minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms. Children may have an increased risk of suicide while taking antidepressants. Be sure you talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking or withdrawing antidepressants.

The windstorm packed 155 mph wind gust and had 110 mph winds for over 1 hour! I lived though this strom and I am only 15 years old. Other people have never seen a storm like this in over 150 years. The lakes ,which never get waves over 3 ft, had waves over 15 ft and reports of 25 foot waves. My grandpa was rescued from his dog just seconds before a tree branch landed on his bed. He was sleeping in the bed and the 1/2 ton tree branch would of fell on him if it wernt for his dog. Many bins were destroyed and tossed around. Cars were lost in lakes and many chairs outside were blown for over 30 miles away from where they were. Houses were moved off their foundations. The weather service never even said that there was never a single tornado, but in Summit, Sd we reported over 3 large and wide tornadoes. 150 year old cottonwoods were uprooted and everything just blew away.

GioA9OFgaa	It depends on the type of mold, which can be anything from white to black.  There are many types of mold, and you cannot really tell what it is by color - you need to "culture" the mold to find out what it is.<br>  <br>  Healthy things like grapes have a wild yeast on the skins that appears white-ish if it dries.  Yeast will generally prohibit mold from growing anywhere near it...

lLjDfc6laa	Honest answer?  Petroleum engineering will keep your options more open, allowing you to pursue various career paths in the oil industry.  At the minute, you say you'd prefer to work in an office, but in five years time the idea of being the PE on site on an offshore rig might appeal to you.  But don't get too hung up on choosing 'the right' course at University.  Here's the real secret - there is no 'right' course most of the time.  As someone who recruits people in the oil industry, what I'm looking for are people who are intelligent, engaged and have the basic knowledge that allows me to train them in our way of doing things.  For a specialist role, I'll want a petroleum geologist maybe.  But for most roles I need to fill, either an engineer or a geologist would do, and it's much more important that the PERSON fits the team.  So if you prefer the geology, take the geology course.  Ultimately, you'll have more chance of completing a university course if its what you like to do - and you're much more employable with a degree than without one.  Career paths aren't, on the whole, determined entirely by the choices you make entering University, so I repeat - don't get too worked up about making the right choice.  Heck, choose your courses well and you'll probably be able to transfer between the two disciplines quite painlessly if you want togive them both a try.  Good luck!|`|NvSDc8bJaa	The salaries are very similar but with petroleum geology there is a greater range which, incidentally, potentially ends up higher dependent on what you do (highest is well site geology, DO NOT DO MUD LOGGING). However I would not recommend going into something purely for the money and if you don't enjoy being in the field then I would advise against geology. You may also want to consider geophysics. Ultimately it's your choice but I would suggest that if you go for a geology course you do a geology degree as just petroleum geology will limit what is open to you.<br>  <br>  The better major? Only you can decide that, I would personally go with petroleum geology but as I do geology I'm fairly biased. Do what you enjoy more as this will ultimately give you a better chance of doing well.|`|kK4qS6M1aa	definately engineering more money especially 5 years down the track. u can even get into alot of other things with engineering like consulting that u wouldnt be able to with geology because engineers have better problem solving skills whereas geology is a science. and u can get really rich if u stick with petroleum industry good choice im going in mining so its similar. im an engineer (soon).

Start off practicing with small pills and move up on the size and in no time, you will be able to swallow pills. <br>  <br>  Note: Don't just take any random pills you can find at home, of course.

You are afraid you are going to choke if you swallow it because you are used to chewing food, therefore you stop yourself from allowing the pill to pass. It does feel weird, I know but I learned how to do it by accident. I swallowed a small piece of ice by accident, and it kind of just slid down my throat. It felt strange because I wasn't used to it, but after that, I started swallowing small m&ms and things like that. Eventually, I just "trained" myself to be able to swallow it without fear. It also helps if you put the pill at the back of your throat. It might help if you drink milk, or a thicker kind of beverage, (water works too) and fill it up in your mouth and just swallow it all together with the pill. You won't even feel it.

O7rMKLEMaa	3D space is not warped, and the warping of 4D space-time is a mathematical description of the effect of gravity; it is not the cause of gravity. No one has yet come up with a reasonable explanation for the cause of gravity. <br>  <br>  The lack of friction in the vacuum of space is enough to explain why planets don't spiral in closer to the sun. <br>  <br>  Another possibility is that gravity propagates thru space at some finite speed; whereas, general relativity tacitly assumes that gravity propagates at infinite speed. If gravity propagated at the speed of light, all of the planets would be quickly thrown out of orbit because the sun's gravity would come at us from the direction where it was 8 minutes ago. It is more likely that the speed of gravity is at least 20 billion times faster than the speed of light.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	the ball constantly loses energy to friction, and stops.<br>  the earth has nothing to have friction with.. in fact sunlight does little pressure on the earth.|`|f2AWSb48aa	Gravitational potential of planets is not just defined by the single pull of a large object like the sun, although the force of gravity dissipates as it goes further from a planet, there are still an infinite number of sources of pull on any particular object in space.<br>  It is also due to the difference between angular and linear velocity of an object moving in a circular path, referring to this diagram might help:<br>  <a href="http://www.euclideanspace.com/physics/kinematics/angularvelocity/angularvelocitysolid.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.euclideanspace.com/physics/ki...</a>|`|luYtFLSUaa	What you say has some truth in it, but you're leaving out the fact that the earth is racing around the sun at some speed. If your marble were placed on the depression in your bed with a motor attached to negate the friction of the sheets, it could ride the depression round and round above the bowling ball.  The planets all have orbital speed. Without the sun's gravity they would speed off in straight lives and depart the solar system. But the sun's gravity does act on them and the result is an elliptical orbit about the sun. The planets never slow down because there is no friction in empty space and they can orbit essentially forever (Newton's laws of motion - inertia).

From our perspective in the northern hemisphere, the sun is 23 degrees above the equator in June and 23 degrees below the equator in December because of the rotational axis angle. I need a diagram to show this properly - See "Voyages through the Universe" by Fraknoi, et.al. This is why the sun appears high in our sky in summer and low in the south in winter.   So the sun appears to move through 46 degrees in 6 months = 7.6 degrees/month roughly. (Jun - Dec)

Belief is faith without evidence, or faith in something not subject to scrutiny due to it not being provable or disprovable. <br>  <br>  There is no evidence whatsoever for Creationism. The bible is not evidence - it is a book of mythology. How is this book any more valid than scriptures telling of how the gods of Olympus ruled over Greece?

k18Av0D2aa	land breeze (convection currents)<br>  <br>  It's the result of a process known as convection. Convection is the uneven heating of the earth's surface, creating warm and cold air masses that rise and/or descend upon each other as they change temperature, making wind currents.<br>  <br>  Earth (at least the first few inches) heats and cools faster than the ocean. So during the day the colder ocean winds rush in to replace the warmer, lower density air. They sweep toward the land, making a sea breeze. At night, as the earth rapidly cools, the process reverses with the land's now colder air sweeping out to sea where the air is warmer and again less dense. This is called a land breeze.|`|B5EgyPlpaa	um wind hello?

In other words, one mole of hydrogen gas will occupy the same volume as one mole of carbon dioxide gas if they are both at the same pressure and temperature.

However, remember, what we see can be very misleading. Although I can't specifically say what happened to the car at your friends house, for the most part everything is not sinking... in fact, it is more that the ground is rising up as it is sinking. As the earth and rocks become weathered, water from rain and snow melts will wash away sediments. Anything in a basin, or 'downhill' of the sediment will eventually become buried. And, as you mentioned, the earth keeps recycling itself, which means more rocks to weather. Some of the oldest places on earth, such as the Acasta gneiss, are actually remnants of plutonic rocks that have had the overlying material eroded away, and the crust pushed up. For the most part, we have a fairly decent record of what has happened on earth through time. Also, what you see occurring with your friends car is not a fair comparison with catastrophism or 'earth shaping' events like what would have happened during the Atlantis legends; your friends car took a few decades to be buried, but for Atlantis or your theoretical civilizations, it was immediate. I believe we are a link in a chain.

The short answer to your question is no... you cannot have negative energy terms. However, these quantities may mathematically be written as negative quantities, depending on your system convention. For example, if you look at a free falling object... you have an acceleration (force) acting on the object due to gravity; and a drag force working in the opposite direction.While true that a calculation of the kinetic energy will always give you a positive number (1/2 mV^2 -- where V^2 is always positive), clearly when you go to calculate the net kinetic energy in the system it can be negative or positive -- depending on your convention.|`|AA10238236	Since centripetal force  x acts at right angles to the displacement of object (which is in the tangential direction), it cannot do work.<br>  Explaination: The general formula for work is given by <br>  W = F*cos(theta) and since theta is 90 degrees W = 0<br>  <br>  The force of kinetic friction acting on an object is opposite to the direction of motion.

There is also a second force pushing straight down on the car from the normal force from the track (the loop).<br>  <br>  If the car is traveling in a circular loop, then it must be that the centripetal force (that is, the force that is always pointing toward the center of the loop) has a magnitude of m*v^2/r, where m is the mass of the car, r is the radius of the loop, and v is the speed of the car. If the net tug on the car was any different than that, then the car would not be traveling in a circle.<br>  <br>  For example, imagine a satellite orbiting the earth. There is a force from gravity pulling that satellite toward the center of the earth all the time. If that satellite wants to travel in a CIRCLE of radius r, it MUST adjust its speed v so that m*v^2/r is EQUAL to the force of gravity. <br>  <br>  In the case of the loop, if the car is FORCED to travel in a circle, then the normal force pushing against the car from the top of the loop is constantly CHANGING. This is because gravity is helping to pull toward the center of the loop at the TOP of the loop but is working AGAINST centripetal force at the BOTTOM of the loop.

This is taking human-centric tests which do not take into account their gorilla-ness, too.  For example, the famous Kiki had on her test a question which asked her where she would go in a rainstorm; out in the open, under a tree, or into a house.  Of course Kiki chose the tree, but the test gave her a lower IQ rating for choosing that over a house.  There is substantial evidence that Gorillas are really much closer to us in intelligence than we care to admit.  The case is no different with chimps.  The are even known to use tools, they have recently been discovered to be making tools which they use as weapons, and they have very complex societies.  Orangutangs may be the smartest, though.  They do very well with complex abstract thought, which they seem to have developed so they can plan and remember very specific routes through the treetops and canopy so they can travel extensively without haveing to go down to the ground.  But they are not as socially developed, leading very solitary lives.  Nonetheless, when they live in captivity and relate socially with humans or other orangutangs, they do very well and don't seem to be missing any of the really important things.<br>  I don't necessarily think we are any smarter than any other animals; we all just do things differently.  We judge things by our own lights, but that does not necessarily make our judgements true.

AA11287710	Doug is right. The given equation h=-16t^2+180 suggest that the the stone has a maximum height of 180ft, unless height is measured not in feet but half-feet or unless the pond is somehow 180 ft from the top of the building (180ft of the building is beneath the water level?)

I would like to interpret this as how long does it take to pass through the point of height 60 ft which would be an infinitely small amount of time.<br>  <br>  But we'll do this:<br>  Assuming the pond is at the base of the 360 ft building we will consider h ranging from 180 ft (top of building) to -180 ft (pond).

AA11635772	BCD is Binary Coded Decimal, the same as binary up to the value of ten. Four bits can be used to describe sixteen possible values from 0 to 15, or 0 to E. BCD uses only the first ten, 0 to 9. <br>  <br>  BCD is used for values important to humans, since we generally count in decimal. This means that when we count, we carry when we reach ten - from 9 to 10, from 99 to 100, and so forth. <br>  <br>  When counting from 0 to 16, or from 0 to E, you carry at E to 10, and from EE to 100, and so forth. This is called hexidecimal. So if you see the hex value A9, it is the same as 169 in decimal. Hexidecimal characters are used in computers to represent all the possible values that four bits can have, since it uses all possibilities. BCD wastes the four bit values that are possible, above those used for just counting from one to ten. But this is sometimes necessary to convert from one to the other for human reasons. If a computer holds a four bit value in its memory, and then it is told to start increasing the value, it will pass through all the hexidecimal values, too. <br>  <br>  An example is the date, which is a decimal number up to 31. The computer wants to go to A when it gets to 9, but there is no such date. The "Bth" of January? Or, the "Eth" of February? So, the computer is allowed to count from 0 to 1F, but we know this is 0 to 31 in human decimal form.<br>  <br>  There is no way to tell if a hexidecimal character is BCD or not, just by looking at it. Since hexidecimal includes BCD, only if there were a lot of values, but no letters, could you surmise these are BCD. To convert from BCD to hexidecimal, just divide the number by multiples of sixteen until it is broken down. If it can be divided by 256, but not 4096, then there is a character in the third field, such as 3xx, but not the fourth. To convert from hexidecimal to BCD, this requires taking the value in each field and multiplying it by the value of that field, then adding up all the amounts. If the hexidecimal value if A9, then you will take ten times sixteen because "A" has a value of ten and it is in the field having a value of sixteen, then add it to nine times one, since the "9" has a value of nine and it is in the field having a value of one.<br>  <br>  It may help to think of what we're doing when we count in decimal. A number such as 87 is eight times ten plus seven times one. A number such as 387 is three times one hundred plus eight times ten plus seven times one. In hexidecimal, a number such as 2AB is two times two hundred fifty six plus ten times sixteen plus eleven times one.  In decimal, each field is ten times as much as you carry to the left. In hexidecimal, each field is sixteen times as much when you carry to the left.<br>  <br>  Experiment using the Windows Desktop calculator to convert from decimal to hexidecimal and back again.|`|4Lqp4tgOaa	BCD is Binary-coded decimal. <br>  Binary is based on 2.<br>  <br>  In Binary 10 is 1010<br>  Whereas in BCD 10 is 0001 0000 (1 is 0001 and 0 is 0000) and so forth.

Although it may be used elsewhere, I think it was developed primarily to drive Pixie tubes (the predecessor to LCD and LED) displays because humans think in decimal digits.  If you look at the time on your digital clock, somewhere a chip is sending 4 BCD coded numbers to the 7 segment displays that translate it into what segments to light up.  In most cases you can actually send BCD code up to 15 and the same display will show A,B,C,D,C for 10,11,12,13,14 - although this is "hexadecimal" and not particularly interesting unless you are an old-school computer guy who thinks in it.
4Lqp4tgOaa	Ancient Sumerians and Babylonians used base-60 numbers as compared to our current base-10 number system.<br>  <br>  FYI: Their circular calendar which dates back to about 2400 BC, divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, that is, 360 days.<br>  <br>  That's how we got a 360 degree circle. Around 1500 BC, Egyptians divided the day into 24 hours, though the hours varied with the seasons originally. Greek astronomers made the hours equal. About 300 to 100 BC, the Babylonians subdivided the hour into base-60 fractions: 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.

Other measurements came from the body too, for example:  the foot (still used today), the hand ( used a lot in ancient times, now only used to measure the height of horses), and the cubit ( the pyramids are measured in cubits.

It is very much like the solar system with the sun at the center and the planets revolving around it. They were formed right after the "Big Bang" when our known universe originated from pure energy some billions of years ago. The energy was converted to the elementary particles (quarks, gluons, leptons etc...) from which protons and neutrons were formed. From these, atoms of different elements were produced.<br>  <br>  What is an atom? What are atoms made of?<br>  <br>  Atoms are the basic building blocks of ordinary matter. Atoms can join together to form molecules, which in turn form most of the objects around you.<br>  <br>  Atoms are composed of particles called protons, electrons and neutrons. Protons carry a positive electrical charge, electrons carry a negative electrical charge and neutrons carry no electrical charge at all. The protons and neutrons cluster together in the central part of the atom, called the nucleus, and the electrons 'orbit' the nucleus. A particular atom will have the same number of protons and electrons and most atoms have at least as many neutrons as protons.<br>  <br>  Protons and neutrons are both composed of other particles called quarks and gluons. Protons contain two 'up' quarks and one 'down' quark while neutrons contain one 'up' quark and two 'down' quarks. The gluons are responsible for binding the quarks to one another.|`|E0AF8mcfaa	In the process of atom formation, the carriers of characteristics of the nucleus and the electrons influenced each other even after they had achieved equilibrium. This happened while electrons were circling the nuclei, attracting and repelling each other, so that the nucleus had to counterbalance the encircling influence at every position, making it difficult for the nucleus to stay still in its place. This condition made the nucleus vibrate and the electrons sinuous. Concentration was thus the beginning of change, movement, temperature and time.|`|AA10845005	All of the hydrogen in the Universe and some of the helium were produced in the Big Bang.<br>  <br>  All other elements are created in two ways:<br>  <br>  1) nuclear fusion (naturally in stars or artificially in some kind of fusion reactor)<br>  2) nuclear fission - decay of one radioative element into another.|`|Chv3j7Piaa	atom is made of protons,neutrons and electrons.protons have a positive charge,nuetrons are nuetral and electrons have a negative charge.there are same numbers of protons and electrons in an atom.they nullify each other and hence the atomic charge of the atom is zero.|`|rHBWnLc4aa	Composition of the Atom<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The atom consists of a tiny nucleus surrounded by moving electrons.  The nucleus contains protons, which have a positive charge equal in magnitude to the electron's negative charge.  The nucleus may also contain neutrons, which have virtually the same mass but no charge.
J9KwQuxhaa	You need to be a bit more specific but I can say that there are 2s cycles.<br>  There is a water cycle and  nutrient cycle. I don't think they do interact.<br>  There is also a soil moisture budget but it is not cyclic so I can't call it a cyle but it is greatly influenced by the water cycle. Basically depending on what is happening in the water cycle determines what is happening in the soil moisture budget.|`|E0AF8mcfaa	Rainforest ecosystems are characterised by heavy convectional rainfall, high humidity and lushness of vegetation, and nutrient-rich but shallow soil. These factors give rise to a unique water cycle and nutrient cycle.<br>  <br>  Rainforest water cycle<br>  <br>  The rainforest climate is very humid. The vegetation is very lush as water is taken up by the roots and rain is intercepted as it falls - much of it at the canopy level. The next day, as the rainforest heats up, the water given off by the plants and trees evaporates into the atmosphere - where it forms into clouds to make the next day's rain. This is called convectional rainfall.<br>  <br>  Rainforest nutrient cycle<br>  <br>  Plenty of dead plant material and the hot, damp conditions on the forest floor allow rapid decomposition. This provides plentiful nutrients that are easily absorbed by plant roots. But because these nutrients are in very high demand from the rainforest's many fast-growing plants, they do not remain in the soil long, and remain close to the surface of the soil.<br>  <br>  This means that if the rainforest is cleared for agriculture it will not make very good farm land as the soil is not rich in nutrients. Also once the trees (with their roots) are removed the soil can be easily washed away.

As the droplets collect, they become heavier and may fall to the earth as precipitation (rain, snow, hail, sleet, etc).<br>  <br>  If the air temperature is cold enough, the droplets will actually freeze before falling all the way to earth, producing snow or hail. The difference in what you get depends on what is happening in the atmosphere where the vapor is freezing. If things are relatively calm, then the vapor turns to thin crystals, floats down, bounces into others, and you have snowflakes.<br>  <br>  However, if the atmosphere is turbulent with updrafts, the vapor can be frozen, start to fall, pulled back up, recoated with more vapor, and frozen again. If this occurs repeatedly, when the crystal is too heavy to be pulled back up, it will fall as a hail stone.<br>  <br>  Many thunderstorms, hurricanes and tornadoes produce hail stones because of the turbulence they create in the upper atmosphere.|`|f3586d5e0985f6e9f0447a70215d2b84aa	One storm has hail the other has snow.|`|4Lqp4tgOaa	Hailstorm: is basically a thunderstorm with crystals of hailstones fall.

b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	Okay, we'll assume there is no current and that what you want to do is minimize time.  If she is trying to reach the shore point 6, she will come ashore at point x.  She must therefore row the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg 5 (the distance from shore) and the other leg x (the distance along the shore), so that's a hypotenuse of length sqrt(25 + x^2) by the Pythagorean theorem.  And then she must walk a distance of 6 - x.  In terms of time, given the speeds above, she takes t = sqrt(25 + x^2)/2 + (6 - x)/4 hours to reach the point.  You need to minimize t.<br>  <br>  You can minimize t by putting this function into a graphing calculator if you're allowed to.  If this is for calculus, then you're probably supposed to calculate it yourself, and for that you use differentiation; the minimum t occurs where dt/dx = 0.  The derivative of the function above is dt/dx = 2x/(4*sqrt(25 + x^2) - 1/4.  Setting it equal to zero gives 2x/(4*sqrt(25 + x^2) - 1/4 = 0 ==> 2x/(4*sqrt(25 + x^2) = 1/4 ==> 8x = 4*sqrt(25 + x^2) ==> 64x^2 = 16(25 + x^2) ==> 64x^2 = 400 + 16x^2 ==> 48x^2 = 400 ==> x^2 = 8.333 ==> x = 2.89 miles downshore from her current position.

4Lqp4tgOaa	Crustaceans, polychaetes and snails are grouply called as mesoherbivores.<br>  <br>  It is suggested that the evolution of marine mesoherbivores is influenced by the effect that these animals have on the host algae, the extent of food limitation and the ultimate factors controlling diet and habitat selection. Two contrasting models are proposed to explain the evolution of mesoherbivores: coevolution and sequential evolution. From the analysis of the available information on the biology and ecology of mesoherbivores it is obvious that: (i) no generalization can be made on the impact of mesoherbivores on the host algae, (ii) food limitation in mesoherbivores may be a common event, operating through diffuse competition, (iii) mesoherbivores have the potentiality to locate and colonize any host alga present in the habitat and, (iv) host selection, and possibly diet, is subordinate to habitat selection. Considering these results altogether, it follows that we cannot support or reject either of the two proposed models. Some suggestions are made for future research that might fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the biology and ecology of mesoherbivores.|`|JvPIqkDTaa	I believe mesoherbivores are the algae eaters.

First, gas molecules have finite volume, so he wanted to take the apparent volume the gas occupied and subtract form that the actual volume of the molecules and then focus on the free volume left that the molecules could interact in, hence passing from pV = mRT to p(V-Npd^3 / 6) = mRT, with N being the number of particles and d their diameter, assuming rigid spheres. With a little experimentation the volume of gas molecules can actually be derived by experimentally measuring b for a substance, with  b=NApd^3 / 6, NA = N/n being Avogadro's number. There's one of the constants. Whew!<br>  <br>  Now for the other. van der Walls also proposed to replace the actual pressure, p, in pv = mRT, by the ideal pressure the particles would impose on the walls (which would be higher in absence of their mutual attraction), p + pattr, with pattr being proportional to the density of particles, squared to account for the surface effect (i.e. a spherical shell of particles pulling from a central particle, pattrμ1/v2. <br>  <br>  That leads, with a little algebra fiddling, to his equation of state:<br>  <br>  (p + a/v^2)(v - b) = RT<br>  <br>  That's the best I can do.

4Lqp4tgOaa	Burping is a reflex reaction of the food pipe (oesophagus) and occurs only if 1 of 2 instances are satisfied:<br>  1. When the food pipe is overloaded with excess food (that is why it is good to bite what you can chew and swallow only what your food pipe can take).<br>  2. When excess acidity forms and gases needs to be released (the gases from the stomach are expelled via food pipe) which comes out as a burp.<br>  <br>  This is also true for fishes and whales, as they also have the food pipe (connecting their mouth and stomach/crop). When excessive acidity is formed, they have to burp. However, the burping will be too subtle to be noticed blatantly.|`|235120ee909d2584d03521c5fb15d5fdaa	Fish don't burp because they don't actually take oxygen into their stomachs, which you need in order to burp.  The oxygen they breathe is filtered through their gills instead, so it never has the opportunity to go elsewhere.  <br>  <br>  As for whales, they inhale through their blowholes, which aren't connected to their stomachs.  I suppose it is possible for whales to swallow air through their mouths when they surface, but I don't think that it would result in burping.  They would probably pass gas instead.

Motion in space or the 'movement' of objects in space is 'controlled' or 'affected' by gravity.The 'gravity' is 'supplied' by objects in space that actually have enough mass to have gravity, and as a moving object passes 'by', the gravity of the larger mass propels the object further with its gravity field. This is supposed to go on into infinity, unless the 'object' crashes into a mass with gravity. We would then call the result a meteorite(what a show)!). If it's too big - it's over for us - just like the dinosaurs - ewww!|`|KwUbqz1daa	Compare - In both places, motion will continue in the current direction unless the object is acted upon by an outside force.<br>  <br>  Contrast - There is a big difference in "outside forces" between space and on earth.  There is very little friction in space.  Therefore objects in space (that are not near a gravity well, anyway) will continue to travel in their current direction for a nearly indefinite length of time.  On earth there are many sources of friction to oppose motion, the primary in most questions like this being air resistance.  Since friction is a force that opposes motion, this means that on earth objects will tend to slow and stop relative to their surroundings.  Therefore the main difference is that in space objects will continue to travel with a (nearly) constant velocity, but on earth objects will tend to slow and stop over time.

B1MJwilbaa	Venn diagrams are illustrations used in the branch of mathematics known as set theory. They show all of the possible mathematical or logical relationships between sets (groups of things).<br>  <br>  The orange circle (set A) might represent, for example, all living creatures which are two-legged. The blue circle, (set B) might represent living creatures which can fly. The area where the blue and orange circles overlap (which is called the intersection) contains all living creatures which both can fly and which have two legs — for example, parrots. (Imagine each separate type of creature as a point somewhere in the diagram.)<br>  <br>  Humans and penguins would be in the orange circle, in the part which does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitos have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitos would be in the part of the blue circle which does not overlap with the orange one. Things which do not have two legs and cannot fly (for example, whales and rattlesnakes) would all be represented by points outside both circles. Technically, the Venn diagram above can be interpreted as "the relationships of set A and set B which may have some (but not all) elements in common".<br>  <br>  The combined area of sets A and B is called the union of sets A and B. The union in this case contains all things which either have two legs, or which fly, or both.<br>  <br>  The area in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is defined as A∩B, that is A intersected with B. The intersection of the two sets is not empty, because the circles overlap, i.e. there are creatures that are in both the orange and blue circles.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a rectangle called the Universal set is drawn around the Venn diagram to show the space of all possible things. As mentioned above, a whale would be represented by a point that is not in the union, but is in the Universe (of living creatures, or of all things, depending on how one chose to define the Universe for a particular diagram).<br>  <br>  A Venn diagram is a diagram used to divide up two or more objects to view similarities and differences.<br>  <br>  Extensions to higher numbers of sets<br>  Venn diagrams typically have three sets. Venn was keen to find symmetrical figures…elegant in themselves representing higher numbers of sets and he devised a four set diagram using ellipses. He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams with any number of curves, where each successive curve is interleaved with previous curves, starting with the 3-circle diagram. It can be shown that a symmetric Venn diagram for n sets can only exist if n is prime.<br>  <br>  Edwards' Venn diagrams<br>  A. W. F. Edwards gave a construction to higher numbers of sets that features some symmetries. His construction is achieved by projecting the Venn diagram onto a sphere. Three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres at right angles (x≥0, y≥0 and z≥0). A fourth set can be represented by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball which winds up and down around the equator. The resulting sets can then be projected back to the plane to give cogwheel diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth. These diagrams were devised while designing a stained-glass window in memoriam to Venn.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other diagrams<br>  Edwards' Venn diagrams are topologically equivalent to diagrams devised by Branko Grünbaum which were based around intersecting polygons with increasing numbers of sides. They are also 2-dimensional representations of hypercubes.<br>  <br>  Smith devised similar n-set diagrams using sine curves with equations y=sin(2ix)/2i, 0≤i≤n-2.<br>  <br>  Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a.

Prey capture. (and defense)|`|dEpcj06raa	It is prey capture.<br>  <br>  Cnidocytes are single cells, each containing a subcellular organelle called a cnidocyst. The cnidocysts are composed of a hollow coiled thread-like structure attached to the bulb-shaped nematocyst capsule body. The externally-oriented side of a cnidocyte cell also has a hair-like trigger on it, called the cnidocil. When the trigger is activated the cell "fires" - the shaft of the cnidocyst penetrates the target and the hollow thread is everted into the target organism body. This discharge is one of the fastest biological processes, takes no more than a few microseconds and reaches accelerations of about 40,000g.Following penetration, the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target organism. The rapid activity of the injected neurotoxins serves to immediately paralyze the mobile prey, thus allowing the sessile cnidarian to devour it.

4Lqp4tgOaa	The lanthanide (or lanthanoid) series comprises the 15 elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71, from lanthanum to lutetium. All lanthanides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell, except for lutetium which is a d-block lanthanide. The lanthanide series is named after lanthanum. Most lanthanides are widely used in lasers. These elements deflect UV and Infrared electromagnetic radiation and are commonly used in the production of sunglass lenses. <br>  They are shiny and silvery-white, and tarnish easily when exposed to air. Many are used to make steel. They react violently with most nonmetals. They are relatively soft but their hardness increases with their atomic number. Lanthanides burn in air. They have high melting and boiling points.<br>  <br>  The actinides display less similarity in their chemical properties than the lanthanide series, for instance exhibiting a wider range of oxidation states, which initially led to confusion as to whether actinium, thorium, and uranium should be considered d-block elements.

These are also called "horse lattitudes or zone" because way back when explorers were crossing the ocean they would get stuck in these zones for days or weeks at a time with no wind power or water current to move their ships.  As a result, the horses being transported were often thrown overboard, where the carcass would rot in the still water- hence, horse lattitudes.|`|LdPuGpViaa	The Coriolis deflection of a body moving toward the north or south results from the fact that the earth's surface is rotating eastward at greater speed near the equator than near the poles, since a point on the equator traces out a larger circle per day than a point on another latitude nearer either pole. A body traveling toward the equator with the slower rotational speed of higher latitudes tends to fall behind or veer to the west relative to the more rapidly rotating earth below it at lower latitudes.

1e07c600aa9553578319eab1bef43e5caa	La visión en los perros no es el principal sentido para ellos, por lo tanto no está desarrollada ni especializada como en otras especies como los primates, el olfato y la audición son los sentidos más importantes en los canes.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo es la visión del perro? Su rango de campo visual es más amplio que el de los humanos pero ve menos datalles que los hombres, por lo tanto hacia lo que es el fondo de la imagen de visión el perro es "miope" ya que distingue los detales muy borrosos debido a que ven en gradaciones de grises y ciertos rangos de colores pero estas gradaciones se le hacen indistinguibles a cierta distancia.<br>  <br>  Este tipo de visión y la mayor importancia que tiene en el perro los otros sentidos se debe a que sus antecesores eran cazadores crepusculares y en esas condiciones de luz la vista era ineficiente, por lo tanto se tenían que guiar más por el olfato y el oído.<br>  <br>  De esto se concluye que el sistema visual canino está dise?ado para ser eficiente bajo condiciones de poca luz en contraste con el humano que se dise?ó para trabajar a plena luz del día. El sistema visual canino es perfectamente capaz de trabajar adaptándose a un amplio rango de condiciones lumínicas, su capacidad visual en condiciones de baja luz lo ayuda en su condición de predador, ya que si no pudiera ver muy bien en condiciones crepusculares no podría cazar su presa, la cantidad de luz que necesita un perro para ver es muchísimo menor que la que necesita un ser humano.<br>  <br>  La retina del ojo canino está compuesta principalmente por fotorreceptores en forma de bastones, estos fotorreceptores trabajan muy bien en condiciones de poca luminosidad, también tienen una poca cantidad de fotorreceptores en forma de cono que trabajan en condiciones de buena luminosidad. Estos conos son los responsables en los humanos de la visión en colores debido a que el ojo humano contiene gran cantidad de conos y menos bastones, exactamente al revés que en los canes por lo tanto la visión de éstos no es en colores totalmente.<br>  <br>  La visión nocturna o crepuscular de los canes es ayudada también por el uso del tapetum lucidum que asemeja a una pantalla reflectiva localizada por detrás de los fotorreceptores, esta membrana es la que hace brillar los ojos de los perros cuando una luz llega a ellos en la oscuridad, esta membrana actúa como una especie de amplificador de la luz y hace que los fotorreceptores funcionen como si hubiera una mayor cantidad de luz. Esta membrana se localiza en la mitad superior de la retina, la parte inferior se llama tepetum nigrum y está compuesto por pigmentos oscuros no refractarios, estas dos partes hacen que el perro tenga buena visión en condiciones de poca luz o con un cielo muy brillante o en condiciones de luz que reflejan mucha claridad (mar, desierto, etc).<br>  <br>  Los fotorreceptores en bastón son responsables de la detección del movimiento y de las sombras cosa que es más dificil de hacer para los fotorreceptores en cono. La visión del perro por lo tanto está muy bien preparada para detectar movimientos a distancias superiores a los 850 metros, pero si el mismo objeto está quieto sólo lo pueden distinguir en un rango menor de distancia (menos de los 550 metros). <br>  <br>  El campo visual de los perros varía en algunos grados según la raza debido a la forma particular del cráneo, posición de los ojos y forma y posición de la nariz. El campo visual promedio de un perro se encuentra entre los 240 - 250 grados, mucho mayor que el humano que es de solo 180 grados. Es por esta diferencia en el campo visual que los perros detectan movimientos a su alrededor que nosotros estando a su lado no podemos percibir, este campo visual es más amplio hacia los costados en el perro pero a su vez el perro ve a lo lejos con menor detalle que el humano.<br>  <br>  La profundidad del campo visual, como ya se dijo, está directamente relacionada con la estructura craneal, por lo tanto difiere según la raza y el tipo de cráneo. La profundidad promedio del campo visual en los perros va de los 30 a los 60 grados, mucho menor que la humana que es de 140 grados gracias a su visión binocular.<br>  <br>  Esta poca profundidad en el campo visual del perro hace que no pueda medir muy bien las distancias a lo lejos y le permite distinguir detalles a ciertas distancias, tampoco son hábiles en la acomodación del foco visual y solo lo pueden llevar a cabo con objetos colocados entre los 50 y los 33 cm, a diferencia de los ni?os que lo pueden hacer con objetos colocados a 7 cm, los perros compensan esta falta usando sus otros sentidos como el olfato o el gusto, tal como los humanos los perros con la edad comienzan a tener trastornos en la acomodación visual.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la visión o no en colores de los perros hay estudios en contrario y a favor, los más modernos y controlados científicamente indican que los perros tienen un tipo de visión en colores, pero no en los mismos grados que los humanos. El fotorreceptor usado en la visión color es el cono y se han encontrado conos presentes en las retinas de los canes. Estos conos están presentes pero en número mucho menor y representan un poco menos del 10% del total de los fotorreceptores del perro. Aparentemente hay dos tipos de conos en la retina canina: uno de ellos hace que vean en tonalidades violetas y el otro tipo hace ver tonos amarillos verdosos. Debido a ésto se podría decir que el espectro visual de los perros se divide en dos tonalides, una en el rango violeta- azul violáceo (probablemente más azulado) y el otro amarillo-verdoso amarillo y rojo (probablemente sea visto como amarillento). Los tonos azules verdoses probablemente sean vistos por los perros como sombras grises. Los perros son incapaces de diferenciar colores que para nosotros aparecen como verde, amarillo verdoso, naranja o rojo y también son incapaces de diferenciar el azul verdoso del gris. <br>  <br>  Pero los perros están mucho mejor capacitados para diferenciar entre las distintas tonalidades de gris que la gente lo que es una gran ventaja para poder ver y discriminar objetos con luz baja.<br>  <br>  Todo lo precedente nos puede indicar que el sistema visual de los caninos es peor que el humano pero esto se da solo en algunos aspectos, en otros como ver en condiciones de mucha o poca luz (mar, desierto, nieve) diferenciación de grises y sus profundidades, etc el sistema canino es muchísimo más eficiente que el humano.

Y sobre este punto, nos decía: "... ?Y que ven los perros?. La respuesta a esta pregunta nos desilusiona: aparentemente, no distinguen los colores. La respuesta es desilusionante porque muchas personas lamentarán, por supuesto, que sus perros no vean los colores, que a ellos les parecen hermosos Pero pueden pensar que, en cambio, que su sentido del olfato es extraordinariamente fino. ? Cómo sabemos si los perros son ciegos para el color?. Esto se comprobó, - nos decía Munro Fox- mediante el mismo método utilizado para saber si oyen. Se trató de ense?arles a salivar cuando se le mostraba, distintos colores, como se le ense?ó a hacerlo cuando sonaban diferentes notas musicales. Resultó imposible lograr que un perro distinguiera un color del otro como se?al para el almuerzo Esta cuestión exige otras pruebas, con otras técnicas; pero, hasta donde llega la evidencia científica, aparentemente los perros son ciegos para el color"... Esto lo afirmaba el distinguido etólogo Munro Fox, Sin embargo, veintiséis a?os más tarde Desmond Morris notable etólogo, discípulo del holandés Niko Tinbergen, premio Nobel de Medicina, y autor de varios libros, entre los cuales se halla "Guía para comprender a los perros" afirma, sobre el tema antes tratado, de la siguiente manera "... Durante muchos a?os se creyó que los perros no veían los colores y vivían en un mundo totalmente ***** y blanco. Ahora se sabe que no es así, pero el color no es particularmente importante para ellos. La proporción de bastoncillos a conos en la retina del ojo favorece mucho más a los bastoncillos mucho más que en los nuestros. Los bastoncillos son útiles para la visión en blanco y ***** en la penumbra, los conos se emplean en la visión con color Los ojos de los perros " ricos en bastoncillos" están por lo tanto especialmente adaptados al ciclo diario, que favorece el anochecer y la madrugada como los períodos de mayor actividad. ...El gran experto Gordon Walls lo expresa con mucha elocuencia diciendo: " Para cualquiera de esos animales seminocturnos, ricos en bastoncillos (como el perro), las más ricas luces del espectro pueden aparecer solamente, como delicadas pinturas al pastel de identidad incierta "... Morris continúa diciendo"... de acuerdo, pero las pinturas al pastel son mejores que nada y es agradable pensar que nuestros compa?eros caninos, pueden compartir con nosotros, por lo menos algún grado de color, mientras caminamos juntos por el campo..."|`|df7cbf4da163a00767eea27e54707fecaa	Dicen ke si....pero no esta komprobado cientifikamente..yo lo eh visto en las pelikulas..|`|cf03172aaaf85e5c1160b055d566ed40aa	cierto,no es co?a|`|21ef324839707a6a688c2b97dc1bbfeeaa	Se sabe porque cuando en los humanos falla la visión en color, se observa que se han estropeado un tipo de células de la retina que.... son el mismo y único tipo de células que tienen los perros... y otros muchos animales.|`|869a0ba052cda5f2098c134e83bb3011aa	pues ultimamente he escuchado en los canales dedicados a esto que los perros realmente ven en sephia, <br>  cada dìa sale algo nuevo|`|e605fc3aa3e030315b03565e5768007caa	pues quien sabe como pueden saberlo<br>  <br>  pero creo fue que analizaron los ojos de tales animlaes y describrieron que no pueden captar color<br>  <br>  pero aun asi no se como sea eso no creo|`|yOOxpEioaa	Bueno se decia que si... pero estudios mas recientes arrojan de pueden ver en tonos color pastel...<br>  Pero su vision esta recompensada con un exelente sentido del olfato...<br>  Saludos...

Perimeter is fixed.<br>  Area = L(150-L).

4Lqp4tgOaa	The rulebook of nature says "NEVER INTERFERE WITH NATURE". Everything in nature happens for a reason, which we do not understand. Robins lay lots of eggs and the eggs serve as meals for other birds and predatory animals. This is called as "Safety in numbers".

Dont let your irrational compassion get the better of you.. nature is cruel in the eyes of a human but to the creatures that live in the wild it is merely the way of life. Many birds kill their own young anyway.. by feeding one over the other in times of scarcity they effectively commit infanticide on one of their offspring to ensure the survival of another. Not only that but the birds who are stealing the eggs and killing the chicks are doing so to make sure their young survive. Its best to let nature take its course in that regard.... think of it, if we humans chose to all protect the Robins nests in our yard, the balance would be upset, we have a responsibilty NOT to interfere unless it is to stop human actions. For example if it was neighbourhood kids who were smashing the nests for fun then you might interfere as it is pointless cruelty... but other birds eating the eggs and young is not, its nature, they have to eat and feed their young too its all a fight for survival.... and we humans are NOT the referees.|`|AA12292503	conserve the eggs in urs home with care.<br>  but u must know all the stuff regarding that........|`|oe6n2GQfaa	you could try putting some noise maker type things near the nest.

SiYA52v4aa	You are right...only one of the 8 species of Pacific salmon that rear in the ocean routinely make it back after stream spawning (steelhead...also known as rainbow trout...but now known to be one of the Pacific salmon species). However, Atlantic salmon do just fine spawning multiple times that way.  It probably is related to how far upstream they have to go.  The ones that die after spawning don't even eat while moving upstream.  They still strike at bait, flies, and lures and can get caught (out of habit I guess)...but they don't feed and they are on their "way out" soon after spawning.|`|cca354c45210c070973887c85f9adec1aa	I think that some live as there are people that tag some and keep track of the amount that do

The salesmen knew more about how to install the devices in patients and so performed the operations to show the doctors how to do it.  Cool, huh?  <br>  <br>  So what sort of problem do you have with a pharmacist?|`|DNLiQM9Laa	In my view pharamcist are doctors without the ability to diagnose to read MRIs, EKGs and etc. But for the most part, pharmacists are drug experts. They know what drug does what and can make recommendations depending on the patient;s condition. <br>  <br>  It is true that the path to becoming a pharmacist is much shorter than the path to MD/DO. Just make sure you have volunteered or worked in a pharmacy before you make the choice of becoming a pharmacist!
9kuUd7tVaa	You could use light as a variable. just use wavelengths. to do this you would need a few Gels or transparent colored cellophane. some colors you could use are red, yellow, blue and green. your control could be a non covered with a white light  source. use the same exposure lengths and see how the plants grow under different lighting conditions.  <br>  <br>  easiest way is to make hoods out of the cellophane and place the hood over the plant during light exposure. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c82qC3wBaa	Creating 5 levels of light is probably too difficult for this project.  You could try varying the time they are exposed to light per day, say 0, 1, 3, 6 or 12 hours.  You could also alter the pH of the soil, which might be a better idea since you don't have to constantly be taking the plants into and out of sunlight.  The independent variable is whatever you do to them (ie time in light, pH of soil) while the dependant variable is height of the plants.

9AD5LTLdaa	This is really easy. It's a simple inequation.<br>  <br>  First You've got to put all the X and all the numbers together. Let's see:<br>  <br>  ~  4x + 8 >= 3x + 16<br>  ~  4x - 3x >= 16 - 8<br>      Note that numbers that are positive are negative when they pass to the other side of the >= , and the other way around.<br>  ~ x >= 8<br>      Here you just do the math: 4 - 3 = 1 so 1X. 1x it's the samt that just X so that's great. Same thing for 16-8 = 8<br>  <br>  Now you just have to make the graph.

Now this means that y can be anything, and we have a vertical line at x = 8, which includes all other x values x >8.  Your graph will show nothing on the x--y coordinate system, until you hit hit 8, then everything is included as a solution:  (x >= 8, -infinity =< y >= infinity).  Draw your vertical line at x = 8 and shade everything to the right of the line, inclusive of x = 8.  That's all there is.   The only "trick" is to remember to account for the implicit y values which come into play with existence of the inequality "x".|`|Nsg9J1oXaa	4x>=3x+8 (after subtracting 8 from both sides)<br>  x>=8 (after subtracting 3x from both sides)<br>  Now you're ready to graph.<br>  Draw your X-axis extending from 0 to 16 and your Y-axis from -8 to 8, for example.

Blower does not compress the air at any point.<br>  <br>  Blower works by Centrifugal force. The high rotating wheel sucks in air from the axle (central tube) and the baffles on the circumference push the air outside. Since it is done in very high RPM (revolutions per minute), the atmospheric air gains very high velocity.<br>  Compressor has 2 stages in a cycle: There is an inlet valve which allows air into the compressor cylinder when the compressor piston moves down. When the piston moves up, the inlet and outlet valves are closed, thus enabling the air to compress (as it has no place to escape). Then towards the *** end of the upward stroke, the outlet valve opens (is opened mechanically by operating cam) and the compressed air gushes out.|`|796236e92a12bcc49a378a4de65ca0ddaa	The difference between a blower and a compressor if the working pressure.

8d6ae5a42dddca82be705f10f6b74e58aa	In November of 1919, at the age of 40, Albert Einstein became an overnight celebrity, thanks to a solar eclipse. An experiment had confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in just the amount he had predicted in his theory of gravity, general relativity. General relativity was the first major new theory of gravity since Isaac Newton's more than 250 years earlier.<br>  <br>  Einstein became a hero, and the myth-building began. Headlines appeared in newspapers all over the world. On November 8, 1919, for example, the London Times had an article headlined: "The Revolution In Science/Einstein Versus Newton." Two days later, The New York Times' headlines read: "Lights All Askew In The Heavens/Men Of Science More Or Less Agog Over Results Of Eclipse Observations/Einstein Theory Triumphs." The planet was exhausted from World War I, eager for some sign of humankind's nobility, and suddenly here was a modest scientific genius, seemingly interested only in pure intellectual pursuits.<br>  <br>  The essence of gravity<br>  What was general relativity? Einstein's earlier theory of time and space, special relativity, proposed that distance and time are not absolute. The ticking rate of a clock depends on the motion of the observer of that clock; likewise for the length of a "yardstick." Published in 1915, general relativity proposed that gravity, as well as motion, can affect the intervals of time and of space. The key idea of general relativity, called the equivalence principle, is that gravity pulling in one direction is completely equivalent to an acceleration in the opposite direction. A car accelerating forwards feels just like sideways gravity pushing you back against your seat. An elevator accelerating upwards feels just like gravity pushing you into the floor. <br>  <br>  If gravity is equivalent to acceleration, and if motion affects measurements of time and space (as shown in special relativity), then it follows that gravity does so as well. In particular, the gravity of any mass, such as our sun, has the effect of warping the space and time around it. For example, the angles of a triangle no longer add up to 180 degrees, and clocks tick more slowly the closer they are to a gravitational mass like the sun.<br>  <br>  Many of the predictions of general relativity, such as the bending of starlight by gravity and a tiny shift in the orbit of the planet Mercury, have been quantitatively confirmed by experiment. Two of the strangest predictions, impossible ever to completely confirm, are the existence of black holes and the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole (cosmology).|`|AOdLRtdSaa	it explains<br>  That all matter is related<br>  and all matter contains energy<br>  and that matter's energy can be expressed in <br>  his formula<br>  <br>  such as  16oz of water contains the amount of energy<br>  of 10 gallons of gasoline<br>  <br>  energy wise<br>  <br>  <br>  as far as a time machine would go<br>  <br>  it would explain or express the speed or energy<br>  of matter approaching the speed of light<br>  <br>  decay of certain radioactive elements slowed down<br>  as they reached light speeds<br>  <br>  So if this would happen for those elements<br>  what would happen to us

Normally he knew better than to bother the kill of a tiger but a particular hunter was desperate and stole a half of a wild boar kill.  The tiger followed his scent back to his house and continued roaring for a couple of days just out of range.  The guy took his gun out and tried to kill the tiger but he couldn't get off a shot.  He then visited the home a friend who was much more experienced.  The neighbor told him, never come back here again.  The tiger kept stalking him and finally got the opportunity and killed him 1 week later.  I found it incredible that a tiger has a sort of legal system and the mental capacity to hold a grudge for that long.  I am not sure if it is true but that is how they tell the story.

XR1FG2Hyaa	The first triangle we try is one with sides 1,1 and 2 (since 1,1,1 is not scalene).  This is not a triangle (it's just a line with angle 180 degrees).  The next one we try is thus 1,2,2 and this is a triangle, but the surface is not integer.  This latter is the major problem, so we focus on that one.  The smallest triple of Pythagorean numbers is (3,4,5, because 32+42=52)<br>  So I think we should look for a triangle with two equal sides so that the height is determined by sqrt(52-32)=4, so the base is then 3x2=6 and the surface is 4x6/2=12.  So the triangle with sides (6,5,5) matches.  I think it's the smallest match but i'm not 100 % sure !<br>  I wrote a program to verify and indeed (6,5,5) is the solution since (3,4,5) is a triangle with an angle of 90 degrees (not allowed).  It's the only solution with (a+b+c<=16 !).<br>  My answer is 100% sure correct.|`|a462e482a35eff41b6718eef9c530ed3aa	I don't know any triangle that fulfils all conditions stated by you (Particularly conditions 3 and 4 which reads)<br>  <br>  3) all sides are integers<br>  4) Area is is integer<br>  <br>  I know that some reciprocal values split as three equal groups form vertexes of a triangle but related sides are not integers (but they are square root of integers)!

In other words, it refers to HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. On the other hand, arteriosclerosis refers to any of several conditions affecting the arteries.  The term is often used interchangeably with atherosclerosis, a disease of the arteries caused by deposition of fatty plaques in the inner walls This results to the narrowing of the pathway, thus, obstructing the flow of blood, and consequently, high blood pressure.
9kuUd7tVaa	Should be fine... A fever means your body is reacting to an infection that it cant fight through its first few lines of defense. Azithromycin is used to treat a range of bacterial infections. some strains are becoming more resistant to it, and may be a reason your Doc has given you those instructions. let your body duke it out over making another more resistant strain of bug. it could also be because of your medical history, allergy, or other possible contra-indication. <br>  <br>  all in all follow your Rx and if you do develop a low grade fever   have it filled, and take your meds on time till your script has run its full course.|`|c0409627d09f8c2f38561958fd52a476aa	Fairly standard, except that azithromycin, while a good antibiotic choice, isn't considered first-line unless you're allergic to penicillin.<br>  Otitis media in adults is pretty uncommon, so we rely largely on what we know about it in pre-school age kids. From the 1940's to the 1980's, it was standard in the US to treat all otitis media with antibiotics. Our results, however, were not as good as those of those western European countries that were more conservative in their use of antibiotics. Since the risk of kids' getting H. influenza meningitis was a major reason for the US impetus to use antibiotics, and immunizations have essentially eliminated that risk, there seems little justification for continuing the old practice, and many physicians find a "wait-and-see" approach yields better results.

If it's just a case of having low levels, that just means reduced oxygen capacity. This is why some athletes draw their own blood a few days before a race, then when the body replaces it they put the original blood back in.

Anemia has many different causes, although iron deficiency and its resultant iron deficiency anemia are the most common causes in the Western world. As absence of iron decreases heme synthesis, red blood cells in iron deficiency anemia are hypochromic (lacking the red hemoglobin pigment) and microcytic (smaller than normal). Other anemias are rarer. In hemolysis (accelerated breakdown of red blood cells), associated jaundice is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin, and the circulating hemoglobin can cause renal failure.<br>  <br>  Some mutations in the globin chain are associated with the hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Other mutations, as discussed at the beginning of the article, are benign and are referred to merely as hemoglobin variants

37dcadabaf18e2716d4fce9f9d54a79faa	As an investigator, there is a difference between a Ouija board and an investigation. With the board, you can stir up evil spirits because you are calling them. In an investigation, you are attempting to contact those spirits who may already be there. And as far as investigators being fakes and trying to get your money.....I have to laugh. Any legitimate investigators do it at no cost. It's done more as a hobby. The group I belong to, we are more about disproving a haunting. We look at all aspects of what could cause what is being seen or experienced. We do not immediately jump on the you have a ghost bandwagon. We find nothing in probably 95% of what we do investigate. And, about 5% we can not explain. |`|AA11673762	One approach is parlor tricks; the other is a careful attempt at scientific objectivity in an unknown realm. Ouija boards are like throwing rocks at passing cars on the freeway to get a response. Not good. A careful team of investigators is at least more disciplined, even though the results may be inconclusive, or dangerous. Research will tell. |`|6rTK303aaa	That's a good question Jonquill.<br>  <br>  Of course they will have no evidence that one activity is more dangerous than the other, or otherwise.  And believers will avoid the question because they have no evidence that either even exist in the first place.  None.  Only anecdotes and known phenomenon mistaken for the paranormal, eg; auditory pareidolia, ideomotor effect.<br>  <br>  Which is why there has not been a problem with respect to safety to date.  <br>  <br>  In any case I think most ghost hunter types (who, like AJ1964, are typically true believers to start with) are genuine with what they do, they aren't going to cause any harm, bless their credulous souls.|`|IGAzs2UEaa	Paranormal investigators are professionals (they got devices that do not disturb things but detect) and they do their jobs cautiously.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I don't.

They are only there to try and get evidence. <br>  <br>  This has always worried me because it can put the families in an even worse situation. Especially children because they are very sensitive to this kind of thing. Yes, I think that them messing around without taking spiritual responsibility is dangerous and unethical.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, when I cleanse a house, the person knows me or someone has told them about me. I don't have interest in catching anything on film, I just want to make the house a positive, cleansed dwelling. I take it very seriously and I wont mess with a house if I think the issues are over my head. <br>  <br>  But I digress. I think anyone who allows someone of this nature into their home should check their references, see if they give out phone numbers of the people that they have helped...find out how well a family is doing 6 months after having a visit from the group. Then they should make the decision. This kind of thing shouldn't be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  I think that these groups should also have someone like myself who participates on a totally spiritual level. Not all ghost hunters are spiritual or even believe in the after life.<br>  <br>  And to get more on your level, there is also the worry of manipulation (monetary and otherwise) and theft that one needs to be concerned about too. |`|b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	Good question. I have often wondered that myself. As you know if you have followed any of my posts here over the years that I am a paranormal investigator myself, but I differ from most. One I do not claim to be a "PROFESSIONAL" although I am professional in my practice that is I conduct myself in a very professional manor.<br>  <br>  I also do not call myself a scientist and my goal is not to prove to the skeptical world ghosts exist. I simply try to debunk a haunting and help the client. I have no website I try to lure people to and I  have no book in the process of being published ever. Most of the time I find normal explanations but even then sometimes the client still feels he or she is haunted. I am also an ordained minister so I help them spirituality as much as they allow me to if willing. <br>  <br>  I do not think Ouija boards are harmful. I have used them off and onn since I was 12 way back in 1964. The only thing I have witnessed is kids I knew who wanted to be the subject of attention at church making things up. I have sat around these kids who claim the board fly across the room and other supernatural things and witnessed nothing but when I called them on it I was the devil doing the devils work.<br>  <br>  Even today on Y/A I seem to be a lone voice because most people swear they are evil. I have personally know paranormal investigators who swear the board is evil and a portal to hell but are very proud of EVP they have. They also use psychics.|`|CD1T7gaXaa	I suppose if you were going to have a team of paranormal investigators inspect your house you should try to get the most reputable ones available. I'd probably try TAPS because I like the Ghosthunters show. It doesn't seem likely that paranormal investigators would often be needed.<br>  <br>  As for the ouija board part of the question, the most I've ever seen a ouija board do is activate the imaginations or subconscious minds of some friends. I am not one of those who believes ouija boards are dangerous in and of themselves.<br>  <br>  I don't know that either activity is particularly dangerous. I think ghost hunting or paranormal investigating at least attempts to provide some sort of evidence of paranormal activity. In the course of that there could be a mishap investigating certain buildings or dangerous areas. There is also the danger of automobile accidents.

As your question seems to be two-fold I will answer both.<br>  <br>  1.  Let's put one thing to rest here regarding paranormal investigators inspecting your house.  If they charge or ask for a "donation" don't bother setting up an appt.  If you do have a group come over, PLEASE make sure you have done your own background checking on the group.  There are those that do this seriously as a hobby and those that do it for "fun" as a hobby.  If an investigating group comes to your home, they should have legal documents you sign that give protection for you and for them.  For example, you don't want an investigating group to walk into your home and suddenly "trip" and there is a lawsuit.  At the same time, the investigators do not want to walk into a house and have the property owner say that they damaged something...etc.  You get the point.<br>  <br>  You should always first have an initial meeting with a member or two to explain your story and from there the investigators will determine if an investigation is warrented.  I would highly advise against picking a group at random and letting them in your front door.<br>  <br>  2.  Regarding Quija Boards and voice recorders, there is some information you should know as well.  EVP's are what is found after listening to a voice recorder after the investigation.  They are unidentifiable sounds - the equivilant of a UFO (unidentified flying object).  Although some may have earphones on listening while recording, any results should be done in a setting where the equipment is analyzed through computer software that can pinpoint the sounds in question and remove noises to hear it more clearly(which could take a few days or more).  <br>  <br>  Quija Boards are a piece of cardboard basically with letters and a pointer.  A voice recorder is just a tape or memory chip capturing the sounds during an investigation.  Interpretation of the two is based on the person who believes they have pararanormal activity as well as "ghost hunters" or paranormal investigators views.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have had a very bad experience with a Quija Board.  I recently purchased another one and I might as well be talking to a wall.  I am not scared.  I am curious of the beyond.  In my opinion you are exactly right about the Quija Boards and today's techonology doing the same thing.  We have moved from boards to technology that is all.  People can paint it any color they want, but the fact is that you are trying to contact the other side.  Whether you believe one or the other is an evil way of doing it most likely comes from your religious backgrounds and beliefs.<br>  <br>  3.  I have ZERO evidence that one is more dangerous than the other.  I would myself love to see this evidence myself if I could.<br>  <br>  My final thoughts are this.  Let's use a dog for example.  A dog can sense if you are a threat, friendly or scared.  How one acts and feels inside when using a Quija Board or technical equipment can change the whole investigation in itself.<br>  <br>  Just like those of us that are breathing.  If you are scared and back down, you give another person power.  Same goes in the paranormal world.

There's a whole other side to the paranormal and it doesn't belong in the religion or mythology sections either. |`|xL6zc0bOaa	No it is not, believers in the paranormal and the spirit world should have their own category, because certain cults believe in demons and don't give anyone peace to discuss what they know.<br>  Good question have a star.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	In my opinion it should be in a subcategory right next to mythology.|`|6A016xwlaa	For sure need our own category.

6rTK303aaa	You can't be a "paranormal investigator".<br>  <br>  Though you can be an investigator of paranormal claims.  Anybody can do this, but you must keep an open mind.  If you are a true believer and expect to find paranormal activity in each case you investigate, you will be biased.  You need to approach each claim critically and skeptically - or in other words, you must use scientific method.  Which hardly any so-called investigator does.  You should also have a thorough understanding of deliberate deception and self-deception.  You will understand that you can't use radioshack gadgets to detect non-physical phenomenon.<br>  <br>  Here is a good example:<br>  <a href="http://www.joenickell.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joenickell.com/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|JwPu0XbIaa	Step 1:  Rid yourself of all compassion for your fellow human beings.<br>  Step 2:  Practice lying until you're so good at it that you can even fool yourself.<br>  Step 3:  Learn the art of 'cold reading'.<br>  Step 4:  Buy a scientific instrument (preferably one that beeps) that will trick uneducated people (and even some highly educated people) into thinking you are measuring something paranormal.<br>  Step 5:  ???<br>  Step 6:  Profit!|`|d4b7e67e1621a19cd35c6b4fe13be84baa	Well here is how I would do it. I would research paranormal investigations and learn about all the equipment they use. (I love Ghost hunter lol). I would find out a place, like a cemetery, where I would be interested in investigating and buy equipment. Maybe a tape recorder and try to capture evps. I will learn how to do all the other stuff they do like using the emf meters and I will try to start a group or join a group in paranormal investigations.

Anyone can watch an eposide of TAPS or read a Ghost Hunters Guidebook and go out and "do it". However, while it might make you a paranormal investigator, it does not make you a good one. To truly be able to help an individual, alot of skills come into play. That is why most people work in teams. The most important skill is common sense and it can't be learned. However, other skills that do play very important factors include:<br>  <br>  * Electrical engineering (understanding of household circuitry and electronics)<br>  * Architecture (being able to see design flaws with a property that could create symptoms)<br>  * Videography (being able to properly document events by video)<br>  * Geneology (being able to research family lines and related events)<br>  * Law (being able to legally protect your group's activities, have an understanding of property regulations, being able to do title deed searches, etc)<br>  * Video Surveillance (for using multiplexers and other surveillance types devices)<br>  * Biology/forensics (for determination of evidence... yes you occassionally do find bones or blood stains at places, least we have).<br>  * Historians (nuf said)<br>  * Audio specialists (getting voices on audio is easy... being able to prove it is truly EVP is a science)<br>  * Theology (understanding of religion and occult is important too. We have been on cases where we came across occult symbols built into a building's structure and have also seen exorcisms)<br>  * Photography (understanding camera processes, how to operate, and common errors)<br>  * Statistics (might make you gasp, but all things anomalous are not paranormal, many fall right in the range of normal... it is good to know things like 6sigma, standard deviation, etc.)<br>  <br>  Basically, no individual will have all the best skills, but you should do everything you can to have a strong understanding on how reality really works. Only by understanding the normal world, can one gain comprehension of the paranormal world.|`|o1XUaYTAaa	Dear friend,<br>  Greetings in peace, love and light.

The key is politeness, respect and reverence.<br>  <br>  You don't need sophisticated item just get the basic gadgets - camera digital, video camera and audio recorder. You can conduct paranormal investigation anyway, as for beginner I suggest conduct at any empty land or field that people used to come.<br>  <br>  However, you must know your goal why you want to conduct a paranormal investigator.

Here's what you should do, ill use crop circles as an example:<br>  1. Research a certain topic.  Ex: Crop Circles<br>  2. Narrow down that topic to certain locations and people Ex: Witnesses, farm locations.<br>  3. Get some of your buddies and go to the location and interview the people, you'll need something to record information, either a camcorder or notebook, a camera is highly recommended.<br>  4. Begin posting your expeditions and investigations on a blog or website, and drive traffic to the website.<br>  5. If you get a good audience, you may get a surprise contact from a magazine or television channel, offering you a segment!<br>  <br>  So this is how my friend and I have done things and it is a very effective and fun way.  <br>  <br>  I wish you great luck with your investigations, and I'll see you in the field!|`|SaKZIJYkaa	well first of all it would depend on why you are doing it- for your interest or to help others?<br>  <br>  You have to keep an open mind-- the word investigate is there for a reason.

If you and these other people want to take the next step then start a non profit... by then you should have saved up enough money to get better equipment.<br>  <br>  I am also interested in this, the important thing is to know why you are doing it and having people who are serios about this.|`|dRtIzr65aa	I started out by working as a psychic and once I gained a reputation in my local community I started getting hired for haunting cases.

Many groups hold weekend workshops and people start their learning there then join with the group to learn how to do this on their own. <br>  <br>  You can find an existing group by going to meetup.com and see if there is an existing group in your area.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest books like Trent Brandon's Ghost Hunter's Bible. there are other books bo others and in my experience they all teach basically the same thing. <br>  <br>  Just remember the home study courses can be expensive and they are not accredited  and  their certification means nothing outside their group. |`|37dcadabaf18e2716d4fce9f9d54a79faa	It's not that difficult. First off, you need an open mind. You do not need any special training on the subject. You just need to read and research. Anyone that tells you pay me and I'll teach you is after your money. As far as equipment, you don't need a lot to start out with. Just a voice recorder and a digital camera. Stay away from cemeteries, normally you'll not find much there. And, you wont get rich doing it. Any group worth anything does their investigating free of charge. |`|w1Szg0Hiaa	Honestly?  Just set yourself up in practice.

0a14Mg2kaa	The metal and the plastic are the same temperature, the metal just feels cooler.  The metal is a much better conductor of heat than the plastic, and so it draws more heat out of your body when you touch it.  Your body senses that effect as 'cold.'<br>  <br>  Your body does not actually sense temperature - it senses the flow of heat (heat going into your body or out of it).  This can be demonstrated by soaking only one of your hands in cold water, and then dipping both hands in lukewarm water.  The hand that was in the cool water first will sense that the lukewarm water is warmer than the other hand - the skin of that hand is cold and more heat flows into it, which is interpreted by your body as 'warm' even though the water itself is the same temperature on both hands.

If you want to have a discussion somewhere without dissenting opinions, start your own forum.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, I agree with Joquil - the Randi forums are a great start for scientific investigations of the paranormal.  The fact that a scientific investigation has never turned up anything should be a warning sign right there.  Not everything exists just because you can imagine it.  The Randi forums have documented many scientific tests.

o1XUaYTAaa	Dear Friend, <br>  With body-mind-soul, greetings to you. To conduct a ghost hunting is can be done anyway. Yet, if one think that they would like to conduct a ghost hunting in a cemetery then the basic rules is 'do not trespass'.<br>  <br>  However, the said rules may only enforce in a certain area for a certain reasons. Furthermore, I have conducted over 200 solo paranormal investigations with no problem and have meet a cop during my investigation in a public park during night time. The basic rules is be calmed and do not runaway. Just wait and see - be ready to answer any questions should the cop ask you. However, based on my own experiences is that the cop never ask me as they know I am doing my paranormal research.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, it is important to bring along our ID it all times that its  might be need to be produced for the sake of security should someone ask for our identity. However, I will choose a country cemetery instead should I conduct ghost hunting in a cemetery because of the focus will be always 100% without any interruptions.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the beauty of being solo paranormal researcher is that we don't need to ask any special permissions from the police should we conduct an investigation in a public place. However, it is neccessary to have a permit to conduct any activities in a group especially at night in a such locations.|`|b6d778325abf39d72f52c74b7068dca2aa	I got most of my training in cemeteries.  Before I went to one I would contact them and let them know what I was doing, asking for permission.  Assuming I got permission I would then call the police department and let them know when I would be in the cemetery and why.   This is the safest and most legal way to do it.  There is so much vandalism that I don't blame them for arresting people.     <br>  <br>  AFTER slinking around graveyards at night for a while I realized that any spirits there at night are there in the daytime too.  You don't have to go at night, really.  |`|37dcadabaf18e2716d4fce9f9d54a79faa	Chances are you wont find much in cemeteries. There isn't a lot there to hold a spirit. Most will be found at their place of death or at a favorite location, or one they are tied to by circumstance. My group rarely investigates a cemetery because of those reasons. It is also best to get the owners written permission to be there, and to inform the local authorities since you are on private property.|`|lOXqBBOwaa	You should let local officers know that you'll be in that area at the time; Show them you I.D. and information so they will know who you are at the time; If their passing through at the time. If they stop you and ask you to leave; Leave and say nothing. The first thing you should do is get permission before entering in any no-trespassing sites; Good Luck!|`|qlC6PVGvaa	around here in WA state they will seriously haul you in if you are caught after hours.  By the way, i heard a medium say that although cemeteries are spooky, spirits do not stay around there any more than the living would.  It's full of dead and lifeless bodies.  They much prefer to be around other people and loved ones spirits, living or dead.    |`|9at6pKmpaa	We are part of an investigating group. We are very known in the area we live. We ALWAYS get permission before we do an investegation. Never go alone anyway. Cemetaries can be dangerous at night. Things to trip over, drop offs, (No telling what could be at the bottom of those) ect...  |`|iUM1h6Yjaa	Aren't cemeteries open during the day, usually?  Why not do your ghost-hunting then? Honestly, if ghosts exist I doubt they are on a timetable or they look at their watches to see if its nighttime before deciding to go out. Besides, if you're in a cemetery at night, you'll look like a vandal to a passing cop.<br>  <br>  Caveat: If you're taking photos outside during the day, you're much less likely to photograph "orbs" or "ghost mist", for quite natural reasons. If you're not interested in phony ghost evidence, this shouldn't concern you.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I've been to a lot of different cemeteries throughout my region.  In my experience, if you're there during regular hours and you conduct yourself with respect for the dead then there shouldn't be a problem.  But cemeteries aren't some playground to mess around in.  Remember, there are dead bodies buried there, so with some respect you should be just fine.

o33aBcqtaa	If you work it out as given then part of the answer is (-INF, -6] . However if you change (x+1) to (x-1) then the answer you give is true. So I have done that.<br>  <br>  (x - 1) = 0 if x = 1 and 1/0 is not good<br>  (x - 4) = 0 if x = 4 and the same as the above<br>  This means that x can not have one of these values.<br>  <br>  Now lets look at the equality part of the stated relation. You can also do this with the inequality in place but you have to be careful since we are dealing with fractional terms and if the sign changes and you multiply through then the direction of the inequality must change. No such problem with the equal part though.<br>  1/(x - 1) + 3/(x - 4) = (-1/2)<br>  <br>  1(x  - 4) + 3(x - 1) = (-1/2)(x - 4)(x - 1)<br>  x - 4 + 3x - 3 =(-1/2)(x^2 - 5x + 4)<br>  4x - 7 =(-1/2)(x^2 - 5x + 4)<br>  8x - 14 = -x^2 + 5x - 4<br>  x^2 + 3x - 10  = 0<br>  (x + 5)(x - 2) = 0<br>  This gives you x = -5 and x = 2. <br>  So these are the points where the equality part of the inequality holds true.<br>  <br>  So let's put this all together. There are four points of interest (-5,1,2 and 4 and five regions of interest:<br>  -INF to -5; -5 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 4 and 4 to INF.<br>  let us examine each of these regions in turn:<br>  <br>  (-INF, 5] is good since x=-5 give -1/2=-1/2 and values less than -5 give a value > -1/2<br>  (-5,1) gives values < -1/2 so this is out. Look at 0, it gives-74>=-1/2 which is not true.<br>  (1,2] is good. Look at 1.5 giving: 4/5 > -1/2.<br>  (2,4) not good. look at 3: -5/2 >= -1/2 is not true.<br>  (4,INF) this is also good since both terms on the left are greater than 0.<br>  <br>  So the answer is:<br>  (-INF,-5] U (1.2] U (4,INF)|`|696ef6ca84fa9734c2fd200c2761fbe4aa	The tricky part of inequalities is that you reverse them when you multiply both sides by a negative number:<br>  <br>  Ex   <br>  2>1 but -2<-1<br>  <br>  That's what's critical about -1 and 4 because under certain condictions you're reversing the inequality.<br>  <br>  Presumably, you want to mulitiply by the product of the denominators:<br>  (x+1)(x-4)  <br>  so that there are 4 regions to look at:<br>  <br>  -inf to -1<br>  -1 to 4<br>  4 to inf<br>  <br>  If you have a graphing calculator then graph <br>  y1 = the left hand side <br>  and<br>  y2 = -1/2  <br>  <br>  and look at what happens.|`|AA12246512	its should drow and consider about limit<br>  for explian it u need graphs<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ok thanks|`|3a91e2a84d248d1f6691e103f2eca1eeaa	1/(x+1) + 1/(x-4) >(or = )-1/2<br>  multiply it by LCD<br>  2(x+1)(x-4) <br>   (x+6)(x-1)=0  Answer is -6 & 1<br>  But (x+6)(x-1)>0 Answer is x>1

dHKQTRolaa	The bending vibration of the bond between the methylene carbon atom and the carbon atom of an adjacent methylene group, i.e. a C-C bond, requires the most energy.  This is because the adjacent methylene carbon atom needs to move in a bond bending vibration, the energy required to move it is proportional to the mass attached to the end of the bond, and the adjacent methylene carbon represents a relatively huge mass because it is covalently linked to many more atoms of the the long carbon chain of a polyethylene molecule, so it takes a lot of energy to even  slightly displace it.<br>  <br>  The question might also have intended that we just consider the methylene group in isolation.<br>  In this case, the stretching vibration of the bond between the methylene carbon atom and one of the hydrogen atoms would require the most energy.  This is because the carbon atom needs to be displaced in a C-H stretching vibration, and as in the above case, there is considerable inertia to even a slight displacement because of the long chain of the polyethylene molecule which is linked to the carbon atom of the methylene group.

AA10335036	The sound is undoubtedly derived from a nonsonic signal such as a radar return from a solar-system planet or radio waves which most planets emit due to electrical discharges (e.g., lightning) and interactions with solar wind and magnetic fields. Instances are given in the refs. In many cases the derived sounds are sped up or slowed down to provide signals in the human audio range.<br>  Another possibility is true atmospheric sound recorded by planet landers.<br>  EDIT re: Midatlan...:  Answer to: What sound do we hear here on Earth that comes from our 'rotational' motion? How about tornadoes, winds, etc.? Remember how the thermal latitudinal transport of air works with the Coriolis effect?<br>  It takes a narrow definition of "a planet moving" to rule out its being audible. Internal movements of planets and their atmospheres, if any, can make enormous noise. Most seismic sound energy is transmitted by solids but it's clearly detectable by a properly instrumented lander-type probe.<br>  Some scientists prefer to be lab-bound and pedantic, others enjoy reaching out to the public in general and would-be scientists. I wouldn't presume to call either type a non-scientist or a betrayer of scientific integrity, although I agree that poorly-defined sensationalistic coverage is not helpful.

Sound cannot travel in a vacuum and space is a vacuum, so we cannot hear or record sounds from planets, stars, galaxies, or black holes. Not now and not ever.<br>  <br>  But this is even more absurd, when you think about what 'motion' one could be recording. <br>  <br>  This gets a bit more complicated but motion is relative. When we thought that we were at the center of the universe, it was partly because it was clear to people that we, that our planet, was not moving. Mountains and houses were not (usually) disturbed. Even the air was more or less still.<br>  <br>    It was only noticing how the other planets moved that gave us the clue that we were moving. <br>  <br>    Our planet might be rotating, but so is the atmosphere. Where would this sound of our rotating come from? What sound do we hear here on Earth that comes from our 'rotational' motion? And we are here where there IS an atmosphere to carry the sound!<br>  <br>    Sounds like a very silly report to a scientist like me.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, I am sure Kirchway is correct, but using electronics or computer programs, we can 'creatively' create sound ... or light patterns based on ANY patterns - devices that generate light displays from sound are excellent examples of this.. For an artist, that might be an acceptable liberty to call it "visual music" or in this case "the sound of the planets moving" but not for a scientist, at least not without being very clear as to what is going on. And from what you describe, this was not very clear.<br>  <br>  And one could not record the sound of "a planet moving" from a probe. As I indicated above, one does not hear that sort of motion with celestial bodies.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: Yes Kirchway has a point that making science more inviting can have value, but I wonder if embellishing and 're-framing' science is the best approach. The realities we are faced with in science are so extraordinary and fascinating and beautiful in the raw that I wonder why one might have to 'boost the bass' and throw in a laser light show to elicit interest!

I would try to think of a ride that assembles something.

Each rider would sit in their individual car.

Closest, means they need less energy to jump (make the path) so its easier for it to happen, so lightning rods protect building by being tall.  Other reason is they are usually better than buildings. By better I mean, that electrons are negatively charged, and they are attracted to positive charges, and get pushed from other electrons, so I would think that lightning rods are slightly positively charged.  Maybe other reasons, look it up, but this is the basics.<br>  <br>  P.S. Lighting is cause because there are too many electrons pushing each other in the clouds.  They push so hard, that some jump down all the way to the ground.|`|tbhglM4Caa	lightning hits the highest point of something. if a lignting rod is at the highest point of a building lightning will hit it first. lightning rods are made to absorb the lightning and not let it transfer to other things.

UkjnSyAvaa	None.  Proxima Centauri is the closest, at a distance of 1.3 parsecs.  That would mean a parallax of less than one arc second.  The parallax angle gets smaller with distance.|`|AA10289970	Proximal Centauri has the largest parallax, p = .772 arcsec. All known stars have parallax angles less than one arcsecond.|`|E0qJ6XNWaa	None.  To quote from ref 1, "A star with a parallax of 1 arc-second has a distance of 1 parsec. No known stars have parallaxes this big. Proxima Centauri has a parallax of 0.76."|`|WGIgimC6aa	the parallax is the angle at the star in an Earth-Sun-star triangle. Since this angle is always very small, the sine and tangent of the parallax are very well approximated by the parallax angle measured in radians. Therefore the distance to a star is <br>  <br>  D[in cm] = [Earth-Sun distance in cm]/[parallax in radians]<br>  <br>  Astronomers usually say the Earth-Sun distance is 1 astronomical unit, where 1 au = 1.5E13 cm, and measure small angles in arc-seconds. [Note that 1.5E13 is computerese for 15,000,000,000,000] One radian has 648000/pi arc-seconds. If we use these units, the unit of distance is [648000/pi] au = 3.085678E18 cm = 1 parsec. A star with a parallax of 1 arc-second has a distance of 1 parsec. No known stars have parallaxes this big. Proxima Centauri has a parallax of 0.76". [The double quote is used to denote arc-seconds (as well as inches).]<br>  <br>  Not many stars are close enough to have useful trigonometric parallaxes. But when stars are in a stable star cluster whose physical size is not changing, like the Pleiades, then the apparent motions of the stars within the cluster can be used to determine the distance to the cluster. <br>  the velocity vectors are parallel so the cluster is neither expanding nor contracting. But when we look at the motions of the stars projected on the sky we see them converging because of perspective effects. The angle to the convergent point is theta. If the cluster is moving towards us then the convergent point is behind the cluster but there is second convergent point on the opposite side of the sky and we use that. From the motions of the stars on the sky, known as proper motions because they are properties of individual stars, we measure theta and its rate of change, d(theta)/dt. We also need the radial velocity VR of the cluster measured using a spectrograph to see the Doppler shift. The transverse velocity, VT, (sideways motion) of the cluster can be found using VT/VR = tan(theta). The distance of the cluster is then <br>  D[in cm] = VT[in cm/sec]/[d(theta)/dt]<br>  <br>  D[in pc] = (VR/4.74 km/sec)*tan(theta)/{d(theta)/dt[in "/yr]}<br>  <br>  The odd constant 4.74 km/sec is one au/year. Because a time interval of 100 years can be used to measure d(theta)/dt, precise distances to nearby star clusters are possible. This method has been applied to the Hyades cluster giving a distance of 45.53 +/- 2.64 pc. The average of HIPPARCOS trigonometric parallaxes for Hyades members gives a distance of 46.34 +/- 0.27 pc (Perryman et al.).

Can't give you name but make your research for they have a price but do the right job. You can always ask a Catholic Priest who will make an exorcist of the place for free, though make donation by respect.

We also don't enter either a home or place of business without written permission and meet with the client before and after the "hunt" to explain what we found, where, and what the significance might be.

I would also go to a group like the Yahoo Ghost Hunters and ask if they have had any bad experiences with certain groups. |`|5atczOqzaa	no<br>  you can have them come in but they can not cleanse it.

And that's because there's really nothing there to investigate - waving around a voltmeter and thermometer does not qualify as a scientific investigation.

None of the so-called paranormal investigators are certified or qualified in any way.  If you want to investigate effectively I would suggest you employ the scientific method.  Take some science classes and then get out there and investigate.|`|wYEggxTaaa	Well, I've been doing paranormal investigations for about 6 years now and I started out by getting together with a group of like-minded friends. We were always interested in the paranormal and one day, we went to a local allegedly haunted cemetery with our digital cameras (we were young) and started snapping pictures. Well, we didn't get anything, of course, so we wanted to find more places. As we aged, we invested in better equipment and started reading up on it, getting into the paranormal community, and so on. Now, we are a team and have all of the equipment and years of knowledge behind us. It's definitely not a profession, so don't go into it looking to make money. It's actually more of an expense. I would look for a local paranormal investigations team to join. Most require you to be 18 or 21 years old, but you can always ask if you can intern for them if you are not of age, to get a feel for what it's like. I would recommend "The Ghost Hunters Guidebook" by Troy Taylor to you. It is absolutely the best book i've read on "how to ghost hunt".<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  |`|37dcadabaf18e2716d4fce9f9d54a79faa	Well, your best bet is to hook up with a local group. And, you can learn from them as you go. Make sure you find yourself a good group. One that investigates more then just cemeteries, and one that meets more than a few times a year. My group, we have weekly meetings, and we investigate as often as we can. We've done historic sites and private homes. I had NO experience in it other than watching tv shows and reading up on the subject. But I am learning how everything works as we investigate.

VSBWOI6gaa	Hello!<br>  Well, it looks like you're learning equations. Now, the '<' sign and the '>' sign are pretty much the same as an equals sign. So just solve it as you would.<br>  <br>  1/4x > 1<br>  Now, what do you want to get rid of? The 1/4, because you want to isolate x. To do that, you have to divide each side by 1/4. Diving is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal-- so multiply each side by 4.<br>  (4)1/4x > 1(4)<br>  the 4s cancel out, and<br>  ANSWER:  x > 4.  <br>  So, technically, x could equal any number greater than 4 :]<br>  <br>  12 > 6 - 2x<br>  This is slightly trickier, because you have to an extra step.<br>  First, you get rid of the 6. To do that, you subtract 6 from both sides.<br>  12-6 > 6-6 - 2x<br>  you get<br>  6 > -2x<br>  Now, you divide each side by a negative two! <br>  But here's something to remember:<br>  When you have an equation with a < or > sign, and there's a negative with the variable, when you divide, you flip the sign.<br>  So<br>  6 > -2x<br>  6 divided by -2    >    -2x divided by -2<br>  ANSWER: -3 < x<br>  [or x > -3]<br>  <br>  Ta da! =]<br>  Hope that helped!

wdUhwD61aa	Ok, I think a LOT of people are confused as to what orbs actually are.<br>  <br>  Orbs are energy. That's it. No spirit, no nothing. If somewhere has high levels of energy, they will get orbs and sometimes they will get rods (like orbs but rod shaped). <br>  <br>  Spirits are often found where orbs are because of the energy. Spirits need energy signatures to appear and do things. You CAN have orbs without a haunting. You CAN have a haunting without orbs. <br>  <br>  The colour of an orb is decided by the type of energy. Just like how a spirit can make the room hot/cold depending on the atmosphere around them.<br>  <br>  Ok so orbs are not bad. :) You can mess with them I guess, they are just energy!|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	Orbs are a thing that can't be explained one way or another.<br>  often the orb is in the eye of the see-er. Means you see things you want to see.<br>  <br>  Some say Orbs are angels. Others say they are bits of protoplasm left over from a previous energy. Many say it can't be dust because it is a perfect circle. <br>  <br>  You will most likely believe what you want to believe.

If you think you have a "spirit" in your house, you need to find someone to help you get it to the light.  That really is the only way to do any good in these situations.  I feel the reason people take pictures and set out recorders is to mostly convince themselves.  You seem to be trying to find answers to other personal questions.  Seems like you want approval or someone else to say, "Why yes, they're real. It comes from...blah blah blah...."  If you think its there you don't really need approval or someone elses ok.  The point of all this is to try to figure out what you are really trying to do for this situation.  Do you really want to experiment more, or get more information, or send it to the light?  In any case, try to find someone else to help you with it.  Things can get messy when people try to piece bits of information together.  Try to contact a medium or a spiritual healer, they'll help you a lot.<br>  <br>  PS Orbs aren't always demons and I haven't really heard of an alien orb.  Sorry.

Why not try to put some numbers to what I believe? Here, let's try; and see what we get. So, how many stars in our galaxy? Let's say 200,000,000,000. Could be 400 billion, but it could be 100 billion. Very dim dwarf stars appear to be more common, so let's split the difference.<br>  <br>  How many with planets? Well, planets seem to be pretty common. About 50% of all observed stars belong to a multiple star system, and it seems hard to imagine planets with stable orbits in such systems unless the stars are very close binaries and the planets orbit far out, or the system is a very wide binary with planets close in. Let us be generous and say that all stars have either a stellar companion or a planet. 50% then.<br>  <br>  How many planets in such systems could harbor life. Well, in our system it is one. Mars could have had life, and there is Europa, but still 1 seems the answer for us. That is 1 in 10 (I have added in pluto and sedna); bit it could be 3/10. Let's say 3 in 10.<br>  <br>  How many actually develop life? This is much more difficult to assess, since we do not know what is actually required, except to say that without something to mix both atmosphere and surface it seems that life cannot develop. Reasonable axial tilt, then, is important. Having a moon to slow the spinning planet and create tides appears important, too. What combination of planets will have those characteristics. Water tis crucial, too, as well as low concentrations of heavy elements like lead and mercury; but large amounts of iron and nickel seem to be needed. So, let's say 1 in 1000 fit that profile.<br>  <br>  How many planets harbor intelligent life? It isn't clear that intelligence grants an evolutionary advantage for the long term, but it also seems clear that clever creatures do have an advantage, when there is competition. So, a highly competitive biosphere is important, but new niches for life is equally important. For example, if there is too much water, say a water world, then fire, smelting, cannot be discovered. It is difficult to imagine a "bright" species without that. Too little water, and a planet also lacks bio diversity. For the sake of argument, let us say that 5% of the worlds identified so far generate intelligence. Yet, how many develop technology? Again, the diversity issue comes into play. I can imagine intelligent dolphins, but not technologically advanced ones. So, let's say that 10% of the planets so far identified by this process develop intelligent, technologically capable life: species with civilizations.<br>  <br>  How long do such civilizations last? How long do they survive to communicate, and how long are they interested in communication? Do they blow themselves up in thermonuclear war? Do they survive their own genetic tinkering with their food, their germs, themselves? How many years seems good? 1000 years? 10,000 years? OK, 10,000 years.<br>  <br>  So, then, I'll let you do the math, but it comes to just over 1, that's right, 1 such civilization. In our galaxy. That's us. We are that 1 (well, actually 1.5).<br>  <br>  So, I am of the opinion that while "life" might be "common", we are the first, and only, such species in our galaxy.<br>  <br>  HTH<br>  <br>  Charles

If the land is privately owned as many cemeteries are, then you might want to get the go ahead from the owners, or they might call the police on your for suspicious activity. <br>  <br>  The other thing is, you are at a disadvantage to go hunting at night time.

921fd3e5c127d3dd26ff9bd25b494b9aaa	My first thought was that there are no advantages to overgrazing. my experience has been mostly with grazers (cattle, sheep, horses, etc) and overgrazing can have disastrous to the land as well as the ecology as a whole. When you posted your question, I did some research, and discovered that there are some advantages to overgrazing cervids (deer, elk, etc) or browsers (goats, alpaca, etc) or mixed populations of grazers with cervids and/or browsers. This link explains overgrazing in great detail, (both advantages and disadvantages) much better than I can here. <br>  <a href="http://www.bio.uio.no/cees/cv/Mysterud_2006_WB_oreccomendg-3.pdyoy" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.uio.no/cees/cv/Mysterud_2...</a>|`|E0j6mhqhaa	The intentional overgrazing of grass pastures is a tool that can be used when interseeding legumes.  The grass is weakened the following spring, doesn't grow as quickly or produce as much vegetative growth thus reducing the competition for sunlight with the new legume seedlings.  <br>  <br>  Overgrazing will change plant species, but often results in a monoculture.  If this is what you happen to want, then it's good I guess.<br>  <br>  Overgrazing of brushy plants will kill them, reducing competition to other more desirable plants.  The destruction of brushy plants in more arid areas sometimes results in dried up springs flowing again.

Solving this equation yields two results, namely x = (4/3)Sqrt (3) and x= -(4/3)Sqrt(3).<br>  <br>  Testing f'(x) on each side of x =+/-(4/3)Sqrt (3), yields positive values greater than x = (4/3)Sqrt (3) and positive values less than -(4/3)Sqrt (3).<br>  <br>  Between the two critical points f'(x) is negative. ++++CP1-----CP2++++<br>  We have a local minimum point at x= (4/3)Sqrt (3) and a local maximum point at x=-(4/3)Sqrt (3)<br>  <br>  Substitute these x-coordinates in f(x) to find the corresponding y coordinates. <br>  <br>  Use the second derivative to find the change in curvature (concavity). f''(x) = 6x. The point of inflection occurs at x=0. The point (0,1) is also the intercept. It is concave down on the interval less than 0, and concave up on the interval greater than 0.<br>  <br>  The function f(x) is continuous for all x, there are no rational x-intercepts. Descartes' Rule of sign says there are 2 or positive 0's, and one negative zero. The negative root must lie between the rational possibilities -1 and 1. We use linear interpolation to approximate the roots. Once we find that root approximation, long division is applied to get a quadratic equation. That provides the other two roots if they exist.

So the terms that have an 'x' go on the left side (doesn't really matter but convention has it that its usually on the left and since its already there it makes it easier) and the terms without an 'x' go on the right.<br>  So you start with this:<br>  4x + 8x - 2x = 15 - 10<br>  12x - 2x = 5<br>  10x = 5<br>  When you get here you will divide both sides by 10 to solve for the x value.
