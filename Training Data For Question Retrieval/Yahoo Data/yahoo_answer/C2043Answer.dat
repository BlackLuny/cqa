Jetzt  sieht es so aus, da? man das Englische Pfund lieber annimmt  als von uns Deutschen den Euro. Man h?tte wirtschafts- und  finanzpolitisch wieder den frheren Spielraum. Es ist ein gran-  dioser Skandal, dass man uns nicht gefragt hat, ob wir den  Quatsch denn wollten und es war voraus zu sehen, was pas-  sieren wrde. Ich wrde jedenfalls hervorragend mit der D-Mark  zurecht kommen, zehn Mal besser als mit diesem ****Euro.  Neulich habe ich fr einen Artikel, der frher Pfennige (!!!) ge-  kostet hat, 2,25 Euro zahlen mssen.Man h?tte erst, zu aller  erst die wirtschafts- und sonstigen politischen Erfordernisse  fr Europa schaffen mssen und nicht versuchen drfen,  das Pferd vom Schwanz aufzuz?umen.Aber soviel Verstand darf  man von deutschen Politikern ja nicht erwarten.-|`|00f3f96d63fe32279b30f44c65b2797eaa	ich wrde sie natrlich sofort fr eine dm kollektion ausgeben -hach|`|207378fc542ac2b0c7bf3079feee00dbaa	ich schliesse mich der Meinung von Paris an.

Do you have ANY other information on him? The more info you post the more helpful people can be! Do you have his email address? Or part of it? Try emailing him!  Click on a UK orRomania Local site and try looking in their phonebook(Whitepages, or yellow pages) and Look him up like that! GOOD LUCK WITH FINDING YOUR FRIEND!!!

AA11100047	When your account is deleted all information associated with it is deleted too. The only faint hope is to write to yahoo explaining your problem. They may be able to trace your messages if they left "internet tracks" on their system which can retrieve the original information. If this is possible it may cost you some money too, I suspect.|`|48c468397aa93155beedcc5ce44a8f0baa	Forget it.    Your account has been sabotaged and someone has deleted them.    They would have been lost from Yahoo servers so no chance of getting them back.

Id8pgtQ7aa	no|`|c0a9fcefb7283d8e2db8d0a8213de2c7aa	No.    A fax is different to an email.    You have to send it from one fax machine to another.    Fax cannot go to email, nor vice versa. The formats are totally different.    A fax machine is physically there at a specific phone number, email addresses are accessable from any internet connection.    Fax numbers are just numbers, email addresses are more person specific.    Are you thinking of a scanned email attatchment? That's a whole other thing.    Your local public library can help you out here... go ask there!

TRLRsNwWaa	If you are using Outlook (NOT "Outlook Express" though), then it has a facility to retrieve an e-mail you have sent. The problem is that it rarely works for me. You can't retrieve e-mails once you've sent them.    I'm sorry, the best you can do is to apologize for sending the e-mail and explain how you did it on impulse and realised straight away what a mistake it was.    I've done something very similar myself and so leared the hard way to send any e-mails like that, the day afterwards. Gives me chance to consider if I really want to send it in such strong words...    Sorry it's not the info you wanted to hear...|`|13bf9874413959dbd425a6a84c9b9159aa	Nope|`|AA10582172	No!

V44ARW4maa	it happens alot. Sometimes a question has been removed, even though it is still showing as a question. When you answer you get that obnoxious "unavailable" screen.

And the "yahoo is taking a coffee break" screen is obnoxious, too, i hate that screen.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	That only happens when I take too long to answer a question.

I9yHqIkJaa	A "new day" is set by Yahoo in the USA Pacific time. Depending on the time zones where you live, it could mean a totally different time of YOUR day when a new day starts.     For example - the "new day " for people like me, starts around 6PM in the evening.    Cheers|`|ebJ02QZJaa	It's probably based on a different time zone and it's not a new day in that time zone yet.      May as well vacuum.  And take the trash out, too, while you are at it.|`|niivsTVxaa	By the Use of 'Mum' i assume you are from the UK. Yahoo! Answers is based in Sunnyvale, California. so the new day corresponds with 12AM EST Time.    That means in different time-zones it resets at different times. here in the UK it resets at 8AM GMT time, as we are 8 hours ahead of California.

I can offer you no meaningful help except to say that i have been experiencing a similar problem with my own this past week and i was putting it down to having an old pc. it could be a new virus hitting messenging services which is a very common thing.

J0bqxozSaa	Yeah, I am having the same problem too. Apparently, the social networking on msn and other instant messaging tools are a way for Arabs to socialize, especially those that are not as well educated in other languages since they would be the ones that are most likely to try and pick up people on the internet as it is not allowed in the culture. you could just block them.

6kvKi6Sfaa	Further from the first part    With this senior setback, however, you behaved in quite the opposite fashion  you wallowed in self-pity and went completely to pieces, venting frustration on the world, destroying yourself in the process.     Clearly over the six years, your self-esteem has bounced up and down like a yo-yo, and your performance has followed. You have been outer-directed, which means, your motivations and goals have depended completely on people or rewards in the environment outside.     Youve looked for immediate gratification, so the outcomes you focused on were also short-term. For example, the attention you get being the biggest heavy weight anyone had ever seen becomes more important than chartering course for college and/or job opportunities in the future!     Now you need to accept that you have been shortsighted and juvenile in your choices in the past, to learn from those mistakes, and to not repeat them. Also accept defeat as critical feedback that shows you the weaknesses you should be working on to convert to strengths.     Dont hope for a miracle, but determine that your motivation shall henceforth come from within you, not from external distractions. 19 is still very young, your future in education and work-life is still ahead of you. If it is possible, get back to schoolwork; if not try a vocational institution.     Make improving skills at school and training the goals you focus on until youve made something of yourself that you can be proud of. First love and respect yourself enough to get back on your feet and get established in your own esteem. Then perhaps you might earn back the love and respect of those you have disappointed.|`|ZzBGpGudaa	Spell check is there for a reason, pal. :)

xtrdlyJHaa	Carefully evaluate your feelings of love. Review the reasons you enjoy your boyfriend.     Is the "love" ready to be your new boyfriend? Or does he just like dating attached girls so he never has to commit? Or does he like breaking people up. These are possibilities you need to consider.    Check on the new love's record...how long was his last relationship? How did they meet? Was she dating someone when they met?    If you break up with your boyfriend it should be because that is not working out...not because you found a new love. If it wasn't working, why didn't you end it before now? Just things to ask yourself.    Ending a relationship is not 'dumping'. Don't jump in to a new relationship immediately so it won't hurt him as bad. Once you end this one, give yourself time to date a few, let some time pass and then become steady with the new one once you have let a decent amount of time pass.    Being a nice person while dating is a quality worth fostering in yourself.    Good luck!|`|QQyWUDI8aa	yes say sorry but i have someone better then you|`|jDU3e3Yaaa	If you don't want to hurt his feelings by dumping him, then don't.|`|ostvx6Myaa	always follow your heart, dont hurt yourself by staying with your boyfriend, its gonna hurt more in the long run|`|5j9bRHs9aa	i don't think it's fair to him to stay with him if you love someone else.|`|H3GrDAXPaa	Talk to your boyfriend, tell him you are terrible sorry, but no one can control how a heart feels.    He will be hurt - you can not avoid it. But you can avoid to be untrue and dishonest and make a fool out of him and let him think you are his forever true love and mess with his mind.    If you have any kind feelings or respect for him, you owe him the truth as the very first person. Do not let him hear about you from someone else.

Mail plus is needed for pop forwarding to use with outlook and other mail progs which have the read receipt option, but it costs 19.99$ a year for US accounts (free for UK accounts).     Note: even when using mail plus or any of the other mail progs, you do not have the guaranty that you get a read receipt because a recipient can opt out of sending such notices. Reason behind this: by denying a read receipt, you make sure that spammers don't know whether they hit a real mail address.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Unfortunately this is not a service which is available on Yahoo Mail. You could add a note asking the recipient to confirm receipt.

Answers:    (1) First only answer questions that you actually are knowledgeable in.    (2) Be polite,courteous and helpful in your answer.    (3) try to make your answer as detailed as possible, don't make it very technical, try to make it easy to follow-step-by-step.    (4) Try to give more help than the questioner initially was asking for, this could impress the questioner.    (5) Include external sources when possible, this allows the user to then find out more about the topic in depth.    (6) Never be rude/insulting.    (7) If you don't know the answer then there is no point in trying to answer it.|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	You have to understand the question that has been asked & give a reasonable sensible answer.

V44ARW4maa	human nature is my guess; askers are looking for like minded people to validate their feelings/opinions. It happens daily in the politics/election section and a republican will not give an obama supporter "best answer" because the republican asker isn't concerned with any contrary opinions. Same goes for obama askers who get answers from republicans. Plus very few questions are legitimate in the election section, really. (but i think you already knew that).
vEqUqlliaa	You need not to open any account for that. While composing mail insert the addresses of recipients in 'BCC' field rather than 'To' or 'CC'. In this way the recipient can not know the name or ids of other recipients.    Being the first one to give you correct answer i should get 10 points :)    -mohit
niivsTVxaa	Yes, Yahoo! Answers is supposed to be a knowledge community where we have united to help each other & to enjoy the site.    I believe there are certain categories where some of the answers are expected to be of a lower quality, but there are many categories where a lot of quality answers are given to questions.    Just because this is a website for everyone i think: if you don't know the answer to a question then refrain from answering it, being abusive to the questioner or point gaming etc does not help anyone.|`|vUiUoamVaa	Yes, I would certainly hope so, considering the time and effort I have spent trying to give good answers.  Of course there are the "trolls" who just try to get people upset and are not really asking a legitimate question.    Sure, I could answer a question with a yes or a no or I don't know and get two points just for answering.  I do not do that.  I don't think that most people do that.      I think most questions are legitimate (not always so well phrased or do not always contain enough information), but the person asking is generally serious about their question and the people who answer are pretty much interested enough to try to give their best answer.|`|DcUoZntOaa	Some do, and some don't.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicatewe can not consecratewe can not hallowthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

On the Internet Options drop-down menu, go to the middle section titled Temporary Internet Files. 6. Delete all cookies (button in the middle) 7.

I'm trying to reach level 5 where I can answer as many questions as I want to answer each day with no limits.|`|CuVnpxh3aa	This happens to everyone, the problem lies in the people who do not recognize that someday you will grow up and know more than you know today. Don't think you were stupid or foolish to ask the questions at the time. The older you get the more you learn. That's all part of life and as I said it happens to everyone  even if they won't admit it. Welcome to a new year. This year your questions will be different.|`|7fb7e659a2d89fef1b835dc202b88053aa	And just think next year...you'll look back and think "Why did I waste 5 points asking THAT question!?!?!?"

9KHCJExcaa	Yes I would agree. I have had issues with yahoo web hosting. I use to use the free version. I now use http://webhosting.thumbtak.net.    As for limit there is not too many hostings that limit the amount of pages you can have. It is only limited to the size of the site.|`|DONQO5ZLaa	If you're serious about this I personally wouldn't choose yahoo hosting.      Try http://emenace.com    10 gb web space  10 gb transfer  no ads  instant activation  free *.com* domain name    ....... all free!|`|8y4Uwo9Haa	If you mean how many domains, Yahoo allows only ONE! If you want to host more domains in one account, you should consider something like Fatcow, Justhost or Webfaction. If you are having problem choosing a web hosting to use, I suggest you do the following:       1. Go to the webhost review sites such as webhostingjury or webhostinggeeks and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.       2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a X sucks search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.       3. Eliminate those hostings you feel uncomfortable with, and look for the best bargain hosting for your money.    Start researching about Fatcow, Justhost and Webfaction. They are some of the best. Good luck|`|1duScuW2aa	I suggest you visit http://www.hostingcouponoffer.com they give you a free domain name, unlimited webspace and transfers.     If you enter the coupon code: 25OFF they will give you 25% off their plans which start at $4.84 a month.    With 24 hours support I have had nothing but a good experience with them.    Hope this helps Louise.

If your questions are resolved (Best Answer chosen), or have gone to voting, you can't delete them. But you can set them to private so others can't view them in your profile. Just click on "My Profile" on the upper right, or your avatar to get to your profile. Then click "Edit My Info". You'll see the option to make your questions and answers private. When you do that, any Contacts or Fans you might have would still be able to view them. If you'd prefer they didn't, also select the option to not allow Fans or Contacts. This step would eliminate any Contacts or Fans you now have.

Bgzjbo4Xaa	Hello,    Gmail will allow you to forward the email to one email address.  What you can do though I sign up with a mail forwarding service that allows forwards to multiple email address and have your gmail account forward through there.  Gmail spam filtering is great.  Use the Gmail spam filtering and keep it disabled at the forwarding service to make keeping track of your spam folders easier.

GSKbaFybaa	As with any pet, keeping a hamster requires a commitment to care for it during its life which could be 2-3 years or longer. The commitment required includes not only routine feeding, care and time spent with the hamster but also the provision of veterinary treatment if the hamster becomes ill which can be costly. Although proper care will go a long way to ensuring that any hamster remains happy and healthy there may still be times when prompt veterinary treatment is needed and once a hamster is ill it can deteriorate quickly.     I got that off from this website:  http://www.petwebsite.com/hamsters/hamst...    Maybe try checking this website out, I think it has a lot of useful information on hamsters. But I don't know if it says hamsters need any medicine, just visit your local pet store if your hamster has any problems.     I love hamsters! They are really really cute! I wish I had one :D  Hope the website helps you! ^_^

tqAEoOAdaa	YAHOO TIME STAMP     Time in your email is set at Pacific Time, that is where Yahoo is located and this setting cannot be changed. I wish it could be changed. If you want to change your time then:-     Go to Mail Options > Account Information > Edit Member Information > and Change the time zone to your time zone. Don't use the general time zones at the top of the list. Use the ones at the bottom specific to your area.    Now send yourself a test email and it will show the time that you sent it, and in your time zone, at least mine does, although it will show GMT Pacific Time in the full header  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...

V44ARW4maa	your last sentence sheds light on your predicament--your overbearing mother. It may sound mean to say that, but i was the same way when i was twenty one and i, too, had an overbearing mother. I remedied the situation by moving far away from her negative influence. I then started doing anything i wanted and began to feel much better, about myself and my life. I'd like to add you should seek counseling, but i don't mean that in a negative, put-down way.A counselor can help you understand why you feel the way you do and can help you overcome these feelings, so it that light, talk to a counselor--and good luck.|`|29sXUFETaa	I know this is going to sound stupid, but just try evrything, including marijuana.     i know drugs arent great but i had the same problem, no passion for life, didnt know what i wanted to do, and actually started to feel suicidal. Then i tried marijuana, i became happy, focused more on whats important in life and school, and figured out i wanted to make ceramics, i know its illegal and i know its stupid, but im not trying to pressure you. well if you want to, just try it once. THERE IS NO PHYSICAL CHEMICAL THAT CAN CAUSE ADDDICTION, AND MARIJUANA CANNOT KILL BRAIN CELLS ALONE. anyway  try and cheer up.
xtrdlyJHaa	You should report it to your insurance company and admit you did it yourself...they won't increase your rates, but they do need to know about any damage sustained. I did that just to be honest when I ripped off a side thing when I ran over a median at Starbucks. They told me they would cover it and they did.    If you want to handle it yourself you can use those dent removers that stick onto your car in 3 places and then the center plunger pulls the dent out. Then you just have to get it painted.    The middle of the road option is to go to the yellow pages (not internet) and find a Dent Doctor who will come to you and do it for about $75. Get a few quotes. Take a photo and email it to them and see who will do it cheapest. Make sure you get every dent and scratch done at the same time, while she/he is there.    I'm sorry that happened. I ran into a post like that myself. It was so bad the door wouldn't open.

QNuW7ivyaa	Just like the judge, i wasnt there... but that story sounds bogus as the dickens. Be it true, or not... it's not very believable.  He might be better off just being an adult, saying "yeah, i did it. i was stupid. i learned a valid lesson. is there anything i can do to please the court to keep my licence? like community service?"     The judge will look at your friend as a muture adult instead of a punk kid trying to get out of a case with a really stupid story.  Judges like maturity, they get too many stpuid stories.
BLKovzlcaa	I bet I have the answer!  Call the number on your credit card statement next to the charge and talk to a real human!  I had a problem with Yahoo mischarging me once and I did that and the guy was really helpful and refunded my money.  Before that I tried their email support, like you, and got absolutely nowhere!!!    Also, in the future I recommend buying games from Game Socks.  They have all the same games as Yahoo, plus most are $9.99 (some even $6.99) and you don't have to join a club or promise to buy games in the future.
