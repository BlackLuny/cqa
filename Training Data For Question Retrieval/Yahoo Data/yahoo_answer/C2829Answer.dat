ncojw5ttaa	MASSIMINO'S. It's on the outskirts of the North End, but much cheaper than most of the NE restaurants. But don't be fooled, the food is just as delicious and the atmosphere is just as good. You can go to Mike's Pastry for dessert or grab some gelato. <a href="http://www.massiminosboston.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.massiminosboston.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you want a nice steakhouse, try FLEMINGS. It's a little less money than Capital Grille, but I think the food is better. <a href="http://www.flemingssteakhouse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flemingssteakhouse.com/</a><br>  <br>  THE MELTING POT is a really fun fondue restaurant. There are 3 MA locations. I went with my boyfriend and we had a blast. The cheese and chocolate fondues are amazing! The prices are good too. <a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meltingpot.com/</a>|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Couples massage?|`|HGohCuQgaa	I'm pretty partial to the North End.  If you like Italian food it can't be beat and if you look at places off the beaten path (Hanover St) you can often find some really small romantic places with prices/food that can't be beat.  Try Gvanni's on Prince St.  I believe they have 2 dinners and a bottle of wine for 30 bucks or something great like that (I know you aren't old enough to drink but just showing you the nice deal).|`|hBQpBogyaa	Buy and make your own food it comes from the heart and not high price bake him a cake or cup cakes do something that comes from the heart it doesn't matter how much it cost it matters by the time and effort you u but in it
FPdwDrPoaa	omg try the buffets...also stop in at Krispy Kream donuts.  I went during the summer and the workers there are SO NICE.  As the donuts were being made, they gave each of us (4 people) a fresh warm donut... FOR FREEEEEEEE! plus the donuts there are so yummy :)|`|lbqZ05KBaa	1- Las Vegas is more expensive to dine out than New York City.<br>  #2- Are you staying on the Strip or Downtown?  If you're on the Strip- (I know it's cheesy) look for buffets before they change to dinner pricing and just get a snack later.<br>  CircusCircus has a pretty good Cafe- it's by the adventuredome and the have the LARGEST dessert I think I've EVER seen!  <br>  <br>  Cheaper (and more questionable fare) will be found downtown- 99 cent shrimp cocktail and the like.|`|BBSnWbEnaa	When you come to Vegas, buffet is part of their culture and of course it is extremely expensive. If you want to save money, then you can consider going to China Town, they actually have plenty of good Asian food. For example there is a place call champion (it serves chinese food/noodle- cheap and tasty). I heard there is a good Korean bbq place there too. You can search it in yelp.com<br>  <br>  If price is not a problem for you, then buffet is the MUST thing you should try in Vegas. The most famous one probably is the Wynn buffet, they serve really good Alaska king crab and variety of food. You can also try the Bellagio and Mirage. THey serve good prime rib but the crab it was just okay. Paris buffet and PLanet Hollywood are ranking high in the buffet section of vegas too. They serve variety of food, but don't expect really good quality of crabs. For me, the must try is Wynn. Wynn and Bellagio costs almost the same. They are probably the most expensive buffet in Vegas. I think it costs around 35- 50 per person. It depends are you going on holiday. The rest costs less than 35.|`|AS3y7kDAaa	Osaka Japanese Bistro is supposed to be pretty good. It is the "First & Finest" Japanese Restaurant in Vegas. One reviewer had this to say, "Best sushi I've ever had in my life!"<br>  <br>  There's also Rosemary's Restaurant that has Great Food, Great Drink, and Great Service. They serve American & French food.

I noticed they were both wearing uniforms.  I went back out to the counter and said I wanted to speak with the Manager or Assistant Manager because two employees were having sex in the bathroom.  The bimbo at the counter just laughed and said "who do you think the two guys are?"  I went home and sent an email complaint.  I never heard a word back.|`|t5NJHzBgaa	I e-mailed Wendy's today because the location nearest me is so #$%! slow.  So I shouldn't expect a reply?<br>  <br>  Last year I e-mailed Arby's and asked them why they discontinued a sandwich I used to order back in the 80s.

The best was when we were visiting Indiana and starting our trip home to KS. We went thru a drive thru at McD's and ordered about 25 bucks worth of sandwiches and such. They were having trouble with their card machine and ended up giving us our order for free as it was their problem. We got home and I contacted the company to thank them on both the free food and the politeness of everyone who tried to fix the problem. Within a week we had a $50 Arch card and very nice letter thanking us for our patience and feedback. I was impressed.

You should absolutely stay away from anything food that uses any kind of peanut derivative.  Each person is different, but there have been people that have died because a spoon that was used for food cooked in peanut oil was used for another food.  You must not take any chances.|`|8HzwFPzwaa	Hell no they're not cooked in that,peanut oil is top grade oil, so no way in hell is McDonald's using it!

I love the site and have used it many times with success.<br>  <br>  Also, if you really don't care about the quality of the meal at all, Burger King does daily combo meals for under $5.  It doesn't get any cheaper than that!<br>  <br>  Bon appetite!|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	If you are looking for home cooking, try the Pit Stop Restaurant.

Indochine's menu items are not the same as other Vietnamese, Thai, or Chinese restaurants in Charlotte.  I took more than 5 minutes to read the menu, and I still was not sure what to order. A few minutes later, the waiter kindly gave me a complement green papaya and green mango salad that was so good.  He also recommended me to try beef Lalot and yellow fin with Asian rice macaroni, and I did.  The food was great and I definitely will come back to try other dishes.
