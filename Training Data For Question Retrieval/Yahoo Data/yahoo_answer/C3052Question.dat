20090222171328AAyAKHE	Local Businesses;United States;Atlanta	What should I do in this situation?	I'm signed up for unemployment, however, I haven't officially gotten any money from them yet. Basically, today (Sunday 2/22/2009) I'm supposed to 'certify' through the dept. of labor's website for this past week and the week before (Sunday the 15th). Time got away from me and I effed up by not logging on the green sheets I was given. I wrote places and dates down for where I did apply and when, but didn't make any follow up calls for the past two weeks. Will I get into any trouble if I: Certify for both previous weeks today, write the places down that I have applied at on the green papers, and call those places in person tomorrow to get the managers' name to put down. I doubt the managers would keep record of what date I called them on - wouldn't they just look at when I applied? The dates I applied are very much accurate...and I have weeks worth of applications put in. It's just the "follow up" part that I screwed up on, and I know the dept. of labor is picky about that. I'm in Atlanta, Georgia.
