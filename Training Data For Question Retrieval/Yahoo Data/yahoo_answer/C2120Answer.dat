I downloaded IM7 because IM9 had so many problems.<br>  If you need to download older version go here<br>  <a href="http://www.oldverision.com/program.php?n..." rel="nofollow">http://www.oldverision.com/program.php?n...</a><br>  Here is the blog where yahoo said they have updated IM9 and a lot of the problems are fixed.<br>  <a href="http://www.ymessengerblog.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ymessengerblog.com/blog/</a><br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|RQvLrKMXaa	Your Yahoo Messenger may be corrupted, or the folks at yahoo may just be experiencing another of their "glitches"!    If it's corrupted files, then you should delete the messenger you have and download a fresh copy.  Other than that, I wouldn't have any idea.
gGZz2EGyaa	As someone from the UK I can only assume that when we log into Yahoo Answers it gives us UK and Ireland and all English speaking countries, so therefore it will pick up the USA questions.  I like to switch between the UK and the USA questions sometimes and questions that I know have been submitted by a UK asker is in the USA list as well.<br>  Personally I am not an American basher or for that matter any country basher.  I am on here to enjoy Yahoo Answers and I like to see the answers from other countries, sometimes their outlook on life or their memories are great and a real joy to read.<br>  There are bashers all over the place not just on Yahoo Answers, so its best to ignore them and just get on enjoying ourselves on here.
KDd3tMvaaa	Yes! - i have been trying to figure this out too. I'm sorry i don't know how. let me know if you find out.<br>  Good luck :)
50UbJp14aa	Just try and make them easy and understandable to answer|`|suPD7c3gaa	Is this a joke? Seriously.  I looked at your questions.  You said no one ever answers your questions, but you have an almost ridiculous number of answers... that's NOT no answers!!! Not only do you have a rather large number of questions open, but you have a huge number of answers to each and every question.  I don't know why someone thumbs downed another answer that pointed that out.  How can we answer this question?  I'm happy with 2 answers, and to be honest, wouldn't want more because I usually get my problem solved in the first few answers.  But most people would kill for the number of answers you get to every one of your questions.  You'll be lucky if no one reports this question because it's clearly a spoof.  Don't say you're talking about another account, because we're only allowed to use ONE account for Yahoo! Answers.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	You are getting answer.  Way more than average, which is only 2-3, if the question gets answered at all.<br>  <br>  If you want more, but serious answers, there are several ways to improve the chances.<br>  <br>  1. Write very detailed, complete sentence, correctly spelled questions. They are much more likely to be picked.<br>  <br>  2. Ask during the high user times. For the USA 6-10pm New York time.<br>  <br>  3. Don't give a lot of extra not needed data and don't write speeches in the added details. That turns people off.<br>  <br>  4. If you are looking at questions on personal issues, this is probably not the site to get serious answers. Make the questions less about you and more about people in general.|`|mM5FwiTEaa	I know!

Think about it: if their was no motivation for users to limit the amount of questions they ask, and answer that of others, yahoo answers would be pointless. People would post, but no one would answer. The asker would post, only to later on be disappointed in finding out that no answers have been given. Users would lose purpose, quit, and pretty soon, yahoo answers would be an unused service. You can thank the point system for the answers that you will receive on this very question.<br>  <br>  The point system for yahoo answers is pretty simple. Basically, for every question you answer, two points are added to your count. For every unresolved question that is in voting, you can gain a single point by voting for a best answer. However, be weary of the amount of questions you post. For each question asked, 5 points are deducted.<br>  <br>  As you gain points, you will increase your Y!A level. Y!A has a system of seven levels. When a user begins the service, they start at level one, and are given 100 points to get them going. Once your point count exceeds 250, you move up to level 2. At 1000 points, you become a level 3. This system goes on until you gain 25,000 points, making you a level 7.<br>  <br>  Level 1: 1 - 249 points<br>  Level 2: 250 - 999 points<br>  Level 3: 1,000 - 2,499 points<br>  Level 4: 2,500 - 4,999 points<br>  Level 5: 5,000 - 9,999 points<br>  Level 6: 10,000 - 24,999 points<br>  Level 7: 25,000+ points<br>  <br>  For each level increased, you will gain rewards that you can use to improve your influence on yahoo answers. For example, once you reach level two, you gain the ability to rate answers with a thumbs up or a thumbs down. You will be able to answer and ask more questions per day as you get a higher level, and once you reach level five, you will not be limited to the amount of questions you can answer and ask.<br>  <br>  For more information on the yahoo answers point system, see this link: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtIrPstAwZrfT7XsQOY56Hjpy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a><br>  ______________________________<br>  <br>  Y!A Community Guidelines:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_...</a>|`|OXohgDoJaa	I change them in for sexual favors from the bums on the street.|`|a19Z5rwLaa	Solving world hunger|`|VEtPZhAiaa	Click on your points to get to know all about the points.<br>  It's mainly a number to say how active you have been on Yahoo!

Otherwise you may find yourself without the goods, or the money you paid for it!!  <br>  <br>  Contact the seller (from the original auction page so the seller can identify the item he's sold you without going searching) is always the best way forward with ebaying otherwise wires get crossed and disputes arise.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Well that can be a touchy situation.

I had this happen when I bought a pair of True Religion Jeans last month. They were too big and I didn't notice that the seller didn't accept refunds..now I am stuck with a pair of jeans that do not fit.<br>  <br>  What I suggest that you do, if they will not refund them is to ask them if they will make an offer to the next highest bidder. This person may be willing to take them off your hands and you can get your money back. If not then list them again on E-Bay and sell them yourself..that's what I plan to do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA12349214	They should have had a piece of paper in the parcel that details what you paid and who you paid it to - if it is an e.bay shop it will have an address - sometimes on the parcel there is an address on the back.<br>  You rarely get something without a contact detail in it.  If you do - go into your account details and find the transaction and you will see a box where you can contact the seller - so do it that way.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	You need to email the seller and explain the situation, however if the item is not faulty and matches the description, they are under no obligation to refund you.

iNXqiDIYaa	i think your question is laden with irony<br>  <br>  hypothetically someone could try to get a question delted to increase their percentage but would it be worth it?<br>  <br>  i currently have a 93% best answer rate - if I managed to get 1 question deleted it would increase my percentage answer rate by just 0.01% (having answered nearly 7000 questions) - so clearly it would not make any significant difference to my "score" <br>  <br>  what would be much more likely to happen if someone did try this is that after a few appeals against deletions were upheld the reporter would find him/herself suspended for impropoer reporting

That sort of question is always going to receive answers like that, because the actual answer is pretty obvious.  You might want to consider not using this site for anything quite so personal.  Our questions and answers never go away.  Even if we were able to delete them, they can show up on other sites (and have).  Any pictures on any site, blogs, profiles, etc., once on the internet... always on the internet... even if deleted.  So think about that.  The technology allows for prospective employers, even friends and family, to find just about anything that's been on the 'net... even years later.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	ok thats not good you should ignore feelings|`|dSSFrYUxaa	It seems you already know the answer and it is wrong people that do that are homewreckers

zeTGmB3faa	i know what you are going through. I am now 59 years of age but suffered with similar symptoms until my mid 30's when I had a hysterectomy. ( I am not advocating this for you)<br>  I felt like I had the flu every month, severe cramping etc. It started out one week before my period but eventually increased to having only one week pain free. I even had fevers sometimes.<br>  NOW I saw a program on TV few years ago, It may have been a medial diagnosis series. I recall that the girl had terrible pain and what they eventually found was that one of the main veins or arteries leading to the uterus would fill with blood, causing  inflammation and cause the excruciating pain.( yes arteries and veins are filled with blood but something strange occurred with her) I know this description is not totally accurate but ask your doctor if  a scan can be taken during this painful incident.That's all I remember and it made so much sense at the time. This may be totally off base for you but I wish you luck with finding out why you need to suffer with this monthly.
TT0rCi8kaa	People aren't so much, "detached" from reality on here, it's just that they are creating their own reality as they go along. (I know I am)<br>  And sometimes, it really does require an effort of will to be friendly, <br>  even though it's probably easier not to. And "fair play" is all very well, but not much use, if you are the only one playing fair! I think it's probably better to "play well" rather than to play fair anyway.<br>  (Simply because Life isn't "Fair") After all, we don't get what we deserve in this Life, we just get what we get. So use it all, regardless, and let any consequences look after themselves. (They really can, you know!)|`|6sJhoXAAaa	It's not a playground, at least not where health and other help questions are involved.  People should do all they can to help others, and you're right there is no reason for anybody to be unfair to others.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions -- I wonder if the thumbs are such a good idea, as they might influence the askers or voters to choose bad answers.  Some of the questions are not very easy to answer, but it doesn't take effort to be friendly. I can't understand why it is so important to "win" for some on this type of site.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	It doesnt matter what site you are on there will always be people who dont really want to answers questions...They just want to mess about and spoil it for everyone else...Boredom probably...|`|LDv4dqLraa	Yes, but what would the Nerd squad do without YA? Where would they go? Would they turn into juvenile delinquents? How would they pass their time?|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Being anonymous makes this a perfect breeding ground for venting. That's the only reality some people have here.
suPD7c3gaa	All that means is someone in the Community, another Yahoo! Answers member, reported your question or answer.  If you want a better understanding of why your question or answer was reported, you should put the exact wording here so someone can tell you what the violation might have been.<br>  <br>  If the violation was for one of your answers:  You need to state BOTH the exact question AND your answer.<br>  <br>  If for one of your questions:  The exact wording of the question.<br>  <br>  Your question was considered chatting, which is a violation.  It's not 2 or more.  One reliable reporter (someone who accurately reports) can cause a question or answer to be removed.  I don't know why you're so mad. It's 10 points that you can make up in a matter of minutes with a few answers.  You won't find out who reported you, but be careful with the threats.  It couldn't have been a troll, because they don't report legitimate violations. Sometimes we get away with this type of question, and sometimes we're not so lucky and they get reported.  Basically, you didn't really need that information, nor was it of any value to anyone else.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Your question was a classic chat violation on YA.  This is not a chat room and not to be used as one.<br>  <br>  Chat is defined in the YA Community Guidelines (link at bottom of every page). There are specific things listed that you may not think are chat, but Yahoo defines it that way and you have to live with it. You should go to the site dizzay.com and see what a YA type site looks like when chat is allowed.<br>  <br>  Just stay away from questions that simply ask people's personal opinion or personal information. Those can sometimes be ok, but most of the time they are chat. Stick with questions that only ask for facts, figures, and data like a teacher might ask in school. You can ask for example Paris Hilton's age, but you can't ask what people thought of her dress. You can ask "What is a good SUV for a big family?", but not "What type of SUV do you drive?".<br>  <br>  Chatting is asking questions that can only be answered with personal opinion and to which only you and the answerer will give a hoot. You can tell most of these by the presence of pronouns (I,we,you,me,us) or pronoun adjectives (your,mine,ours). If these are present your question will be chat 90% of the time and if you can not rewrite the question without them, it is chat 99% of the time. <br>  <br>  People have different takes on violations, but I hope you will reread the community guidelines for other types of questions that are not allowed and specifically spelled out such as Fill in the Blank questions (link at the bottom of the page).|`|F4IjI9qaaa	That means you were in violation of the rules set in place to control/govern the Yahoo Answers site/community as determined by other users/community members.

But don't ever let anyone make you feel you have to lie to shut them up.  Just politely say "No thank you" and hang up the phone.  Giving them a reason or waiting for them to reply isn't at all necessary.

ecM7pdHwaa	For : Points and Levels<br>  <br>  To encourage participation and reward great answers, Yahoo! Answers has a system of points and levels. The number of points you get depends on the specific action you take. The points table below summarizes the point values for different actions. While you can't use points to buy or redeem anything, they do allow everyone to recognize how active and helpful you've been. (And they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.)<br>  Points Table<br>  Action  Points<br>  Begin participating on Yahoo! Answers  One Time: 100<br>  Ask a question  -5<br>  Choose a best answer for your question  3<br>  No Best Answer was selected by voters on your question  Points Returned: 5<br>  Answer a question  2<br>  Deleting an answer  -2<br>  Log in to Yahoo!

The more points you accumulate, the higher your level. Yahoo! Answers recognizes your level achievements with our special brand of thank you's!<br>  <br>  And finally, as you attain higher levels, you'll also be able to contribute more to Yahoo!

suPD7c3gaa	Another member reported your question.  Then Yahoo! removed it.  If that was your question, it certainly isn't a violation.  Sometimes people do make a mistake that's not intentional in reporting, so I like not to assume the worst.  You don't "complain" to Yahoo!...  you appeal the violation.  You should have received a link in the email violation notice.  If not, you can use this link to appeal your violation.  Be sure to be clear on what your question was (paste it in the message), and be polite, etc., and you should win your appeal.  Reports are ALWAYS anonymous. The reporter isn't going to leave an email address.  Your violation notice came from Yahoo!, not the person who reported your question.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/first_appeal.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|7cUDstdjaa	Maybe you pressed 'Preview' than did not press 'Send'<br>  I've done that before and then wondered why it did not appear.<br>  <br>  Click on your Profile (your own icon that is at the top) and go to Your Questions and see if it is there.

When you have questions like this, please post the violation e-mail, so we can see the exact context.

It might be that you have run over your quota for today, but leave it for a while until the Yahoo glitches are over and try again.  If you still can answer a question then you know your quota for today is up and sadly its log off and come back tomorrow.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Compare where you are to a Yahoo day.  A Yahoo day runs from midnight to midnight California USA time.  I suspect where you are, you answered 5 yesterday your time, but it was today Yahoo time.

You won't be able to use the tiny saved ones. When they are small, or the clarity is bad, making them bigger will only make it worse. Can't put back in them what they don't have. As it stands the method I suggested isn't going to come with great resolution either, so don't expect miracles if you try to print it, but for use just on the computer it should be ok.<br>  <br>  (The button might be as "Prt Scrn" or something like that.)|`|DgWUovrQaa	You can not enlarge the pictures, unfortunately. The opposite, to reduce a picture size from a larger one, is possible. The reason you can't enlarge any more is because you can't add more detail to an enlarged picture from a smaller one if they don't already exist.

6ddjE0piaa	From the website below: "In Ontario Canada Daylight Saving Time begins at 2:00 a.m. local time on the second Sunday in March."<br>  <br>  What this means is that tomorrow (Sunday) at 2:00 A.M., your clock should be set an hour forward to 3:00 A.M.<br>  <br>  The complication is that a lot of computers, cell phones, and modern devices now automatically set themselves for Daylight Savings time. To make sure that you don't miss your hockey game, compare your time to the time listed in the box on this website. For Hamilton, the time should match exactly. <br>  <br>  In November, you are going to have to set your clock back from DST to Standard time, from 3:00 A.M. back to 2:00 A.M.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|44vgFcKcaa	The change is for Sunday. <br>  So Saturday night/Sunday morning is when you want to change your clocks. 2:00AM is the time everyone suggests you change, but you can do it before you go to bed, if you wish.

It is not illegal to make a copy as some people here seem to be saying.

That way, if you lose/have it stolen, you can give the embassy your details right away.<br>  <br>  This was taken from the first sourced link below (United States Embassy in France):<br>  <br>  "When traveling, please remember to carry a photocopy of your passport separately from your passport.
