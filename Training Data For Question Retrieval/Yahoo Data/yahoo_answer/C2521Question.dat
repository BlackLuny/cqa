20090202075601AABfKWC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is it alright to put 100% water in your car radiator?	My crappy Malibu has had many odd problems throughout its whole lifetime. All of them happened just after the warranty expired. One of the problems was that a leak in the manifold developed after the warranty expired. They say you should very rarely have to ever put coolant in your car- about once every 30,000 miles. Not me! I had the choice of paying a few hundred dollars I didn't even have for repairs or I could put coolant in the overflow tank about every couple months. So I decided to put coolant in there. Now the leak has worsened. The coolant is expensive and I have to put it in there on a more frequent basis now. Should I just say screw it and just add water to this beater of a car? I could care less if the engine breaks down. I am just worried if a fire can start by adding only water.

I'm at school until the evening today and cannot call the Ford dealer until tomorrow, but does anyone know if this problem would be covered at all by my 100,000 mile warranty? I don't have any special extended warranty package, but my father said to ask anyways. I'm going to give them a call tomorrow, but if anyone has any previous knowledge/ info at all as to what the 100,000 warranty generally covers, I'd appreciate it a lot. I'm trying to look it up online, but am not finding anything that answers my question yet. Thanks! :)

20090202173322AA5ISsJ	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Why spend so much on a suv?	My question...Why spend so much on an suv/cuv?      I will use the 09 Escalade as an example, it ranges in price from 65k-85k versus say a 09 tahoe starting at 37k..      What are these people doing with the suv? drive from schools, to work, to the grocery store and back home, form most people that is what they would do. Why spend double the money on a car that will do pretty much the same thing? Imo their is no difference in fun factor levels between an escalade and tahoe, yet one costs double...sure the escalade has a bit more towing power but not a huge huge difference...What are you getting with the extra $...a bit more hp, bose sounds system, and leather seats and a nav system..pretty much that's all...for a truck that most likely wont' ever be enjoyed as it is used for nothing more then mundane day to day tasks...      Why spend so much on a truck that will be used as an appliance? Why not buy something cheap and keep the rest..or spend on a vehicle such as a solstice, mx-5 miata etc. something to enjoy on a nice day??      Opinions?

I have a 2001 Grand AM and just recently I went for a test drive to make sure that the brake was working properly and sure enough it wasn't. I had a friend push the car in neutral and I pulled up the brake to stop it and it just kept on rolling. I've read several articles on how to adjust the brake, but would like more specifics (if you could) on how to do it. Treat me like a rookie because that's all that I am. I just don't want some overpriced dealership to charge me saying I need a whole new brake line when really all it needs is to be adjusted. (I'm pretty sure that's all it needs, because whenever I pull all the way up on the brake it does not get tight and I've heard it should get tight after 6 or 7 clicks.

Both OK mileage - good service history and excellent condition. Full MOTs and plenty of tax.       Technical specs courtesy of Parkers so may be a bit sketchy:       JP - 4.7 16v V8 - 0-60 220bhp 8.7sec 124mph 5sp auto       JG - 4.0 32v V8 - 0-60 281bhp 6.6sec 150mph 4sp auto (I was sure it's a 5 speed though)       Overall internal & external sizes are about the same.       Jag a lot more refined, Jeep a bit more fun.    Jag...endless power, Jeep...dirt cheap to run.       it's just so - "apples & oranges", i like both for different reasons. Jeep will be a 'cheap' hoot being LPG...and will probably retain a better resale value. Jag...just friggin' awesome power and no worse on petrol than the present one.       I only ever keep a car for a year tops (much to my wife's dismay) as I find some poor excuse to get another one. (Boot's too small / I've always fancied one of those...etc.)       Really can't find a sensible reason either way - so any notes of experience of either vehicle welcome. At present I'm 55/45 in favour of the Jeep...but then that little voice inside my head that likes kicking the as$ of chavs in corsas has a chuckle.       I don't mean to offend, but please don't mention the phrase 'carbon footprint'...it's just my 'big boy's toy' that'll do minimal mileage - doing my little bit to help warm Britain up.

I now have a 1970 Buick GS 350 the origanal high performance 350 is sitting in the corner with needing a complete rebuild. the previous owner did some minor work new weather stripping new headliner put a 1972 Buick Skylark 350 in it and painted the car yellow with a black stripe to clone it into a Buick GSX The trunk has had it it is gone GM A Bodies leaked water down the rear window pillar and rusted out the trunk on most all these type of cars. Its a common repair. The engine rebuild would not be much, The most would be painting it back to its origional Burgandy Mist Color. Okay just recently I found a 1976 Pontiac Can Am   It's a one year Lemans Custom car only 1100 to 1300 were made they were going to build 5000 but  the rear spoiler mold broke and management scraped the project. i haven't walked around the car completly but have spoken face to face with the owner. The car runs it seems to be in good shape needs new front bucket seat interior, and I Imagine a few other things. With a Battery the GS will drive too. But it's origional numbers mathing engine needs rebuilding and the car needs painted to bring back to origional. the tempest packs a 400 pontiac Engine a Turbo 400 trans console blah blah. 5000 GS were made with my optioned Buick GS 4000 less were made of the Can Am. It was the only car besides the Trans Am, Corvette, and it was also the first year for the Z28 to return. The Can Am was a Sports car that was baically over looked but Pontiac made it look cool. My question is would you Trade Square The GS for the Can Am? Any and all answers will be read

20090202123605AAQr4xy	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	91' Chevy s10 bad alternator?	I have a 1991 Chevy s10 Pickup, on my way home from work I was going about 60 mph and all of the lights in my truck started to dim, the heater fan slowed down, and the engine started stalling a little. Each time the engine stalled the speedometer would read 80+ mph. I made it about another mile or two before the truck died. I coasted into a driveway and opened the hood. When I tried to start the truck back up it didn't try to turn over, it just made a clicking sound. Another motorist drove in and offered to give me a jump, we did and the truck started fine. It ran smooth for about ten seconds until it started stalling again and died. We tried again and as soon as it started I kept the engine revved up past 2500 RPMs and it ran constant for 30 - 45  seconds until it started stalling and died so we repeated this several times with the same result. Finally we did it one last time and I tried to drive the truck, as soon as I put it in gear and started to let the clutch out, it started to stall, giving it a little more gas to keep the engine from dying I pulled onto the road and the truck was running fine until I got up about 35 MPH (fourth gear). It stalled and died. The only thing I can think of is the alternator or battery is bad. How can I check each of these and how much does it cost to replace an alternator if that is the problem? If you think it might be something else let me know.
