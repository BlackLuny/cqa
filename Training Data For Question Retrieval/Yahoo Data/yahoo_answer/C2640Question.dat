20090202104821AA9NYye	Pets;Fish	Did I do the right thing? Please Help??? 10pts. ?	Okay. My guppy had fry 20 days ago. I read that she will have fry approximately every 21 days. She got skinny after she had then 20 days ago but the next morning she was fat again. Her gravid spot went from a lighter color to black and she was hanging out at the top kinda shaking this morning (like she was last time she had fry). I then moved her to the tank that i've set up for the fry to grow out in so she can give birth in there and the other fish wont eat the babies. I put her in there this morning and shes swimming normal her spot is still really dark (black like) and every once in a while she'll go to the top and start shaking. Did I do the right thing? Is she getting ready to have her fry? Help me please.

20090202113306AAlkaJ4	Pets;Cats	If society is so concerned about the dog and cat population, then why.....?	Is is so expensive to have your pet neutered or spayed??      A friend and myself are planning on getting out cats "fixed" she has a male and I have a female, and we checked with at least 7 different vets, and they all want almost $200.00 for the procedure and not including pain medication after the surgery.      We even called the local animal control to see if they did it, and they do, but you have to be on a low income and show proof.     Whatever low income is nowadays.      So, if society is so concern about unwanted animals, don't you think they should make it more affordable to everyone, not just low income people?      And yes, we both can afford to keep our pets with the shots and yearly checkups, but I just don't get it.
20090202111641AASQdHI	Pets;Cats	Does it sound like my pregnant cat will give birth soon?	I'm not sure how long she's been pregnant but it's been a little over 2 months. Her stomach is HUGE and we can feel the kittens moving. She waddles, sleeps a lot, and her appetite has decreased. I've seen her looking around our home for places to nest (at least, that's what i THINK she's been doing) and lately she just wants to be left alone. I haven't seen any milk leaking yet, but her nipples are large and pink with the surrounding hair gone.       Does it sound like she'll give birth soon? She just looks so.. uncomfortable. haha. And yes, we plan on having her fixed as soon as possible.       Thank you in advance!
20090202111913AAkwpqF	Pets;Dogs	I need some advice on my boyfriend and dog...?	my boyfriend just moved into a brand new apartment with his dog (pug). I love my boyfriend alot, but not so much his dog. This dog  has always got on my nerves. He trys to jump on you when you walk through the door, when you get up off the couch, if you get up to turn on a lamp-he will jump-and my boyfriend doesn't clip his nails (their so long) so it REALLY hurts when he does. This pug also has a problem with his eyes-for some reason he can't produce tears so his eyes are always dried up and has gunk all over them. I get really frustrated with my boyfriend b/c he allows his dog to get on the couch and his pugs eye gunk gets stuck to it, and when the dogs rubs on you, you get some on your clothes. The dog also needs his glands expressed, my boyfriend wont do it since he thinks that gross, so he lets his dog scoot his butt all over the carpet.ive asked my boyfriend numerous times to take his dog to the vet, and he seems to think everything is fine, so why take him? Its getting to the point where i dont ever feel comfortable in his house, b/c i dont think anything is sanitary with that dog. Ive told him how ive felt about everything i just wrote and he seems to think im overreacting and nothing is wrong with his dog. Am i overreacting?

There were breaks here and there for school sports etc. But now I am back in and 100% dedicated.       That being said, I have decided to buy a horse. I talked to my family about this, and, as expected, there are some financial concerns.       So, my father asked me to write up a type of "business plan" with all the costs involved, etc, to convince him that I should own a horse.      My question is, what types of things should I include? I already have board, initial purchase cost, farrier, and vet.       That seems too simple and I would really like to have something very convincing! Any suggestions about how I should go about writing this?

20090202112911AAHZw87	Pets;Dogs	What to do about nine week old agressive puppy?	We have a nine week old puppy (lab x border collie) who at times gets very aggressive. It is not constant it is like he suddenly just snaps and gets VERY bad. (raising gums, snarling and biting hard) I've had 2 other collie pups and neither were this bad, PLEASE don't tell me its normal puppy behavior because it really isn't, its excessive. I'm aware hes only 9 weeks so he won't be trained yet and i know all hat is up to me, what I'm after is help not criticism. I'm not looking for people to tell me you should have researched the breed, or any patronizing answers that i know people like to give. I've done all that. I have tried doing the squeal you are supposed to do, has no effect whatsoever. I cant pull my hand away either and say NO as he just doesn't let go and it blooming well hurts, I have to prise his mouth open. He is not as aggressive with the other dogs, he knows to respect my older dog as she is old and grumpy. With my younger dog he jumps on her constantly, which she usually doesn't mind as she plays with him but sometimes he growls and snarls at her which I'm not happy with (I tell him no and move him away but he ignores me, even if i do it for half an hour continuously. Hes house trained perfectly and in many other ways a lovely dog. Also please don't suggest re homing him, its not going to happen therefore a waste of effort on your behalf. Please help I'm getting scarred :S

His body had started to turn black, he went hard and stiff and started to smell. i made him not hard, by stroking and bending a little but not too much, it wouldn't have hurt him. However he did not go hard again, but continued to go black and smell worse. He also slept in my bed last night, and wen i woke up it look like his nose was cut a little. He was cold, but still not hard, and smelt worse. Was he definitely dead?      Also, he is now in the freezer wrapped up because i am going to have him cremated. Is there a limit to how long you can keep them in the freezer? And will he continue to go black now he is frozen?      x

20090203164713AAcH2yZ	Pets;Dogs	My dog ate a loaf of bread and wrapper...vet techs?	My dog goes everywhere with me.  While running errands this evening, while in the car, he ate an entire loaf of bread and the wrapped, except for the twisted end and actual twisty.  He is a fairly large dog about 65 lbs.      I am awaiting a call back from the vet, left message w/ her service.  That can take some time unfortunately and the vet hospital is about 1 1 /2 hours away.       I discovered the bread was gone when I went to get things out of my vehicle when I got home a few minutes ago.  He and the bread had been in there for about an hour and 45 minutes, but since I was in and out and he was in the back seat of my SUV, I have no idea what time he actually ate it.        Until the vet hopefully calls can anyone  tell me what to watch for, like will he be constipated or have diarrhea?  Vomiting?  If he vomits it up, is that a good or bad sign?  I know a lot of vet techs often answer questions on hee.  Thanks!      Have any of you had that happen?  I am more worried about the wrapper than the bread but know neither is good.

It is started to get warmer here (Utah) it was normally under 20 degrees during the day and below 10 degrees at night now its up to 40 (almost reached 50 today) degrees in the day and about 20-30 at night. Anyway she has a long fuzzy winter coat will it help her shed it out. This is my first winter with her when do horses normally tend to lose the winter coat.       Also she is getting a tad bit overweight so how much corn oil and rice bran would be good. I don't want to do any sprays as she hates them and tries to kick me if i even try to so please don't suggest that.    Btw she is turning 7 years old

I have a Presa Canario and the breeder I got her from is a close friend of mine. She is planing on breeding a Presa and a Dogo Argentino and I've been telling her not to just because I don't think it is right to mix breeds on purpose. I don't know much about breeding but I know the temperaments of both the Presa and the Dogo Argentino are good. They are both very sweet dogs but will that pass to the puppies? My Presa has a very sweet temperament just like her mother, but that is also because I trained and socialized her with people and other dogs properly. I need a reason to convince her not to breed these dogs but I can't find information about a mix of these two breeds anywhere else on the web, so any information would be greatly appreciated!!!

Although some of Cesar's methods seem somewhat outdated, the concept is sound.  I have myself applied similar concepts with a gentler method it does seem to work.    But in my search on the net for Cesar's concept I have also come across what appears to be the Canadian Dog Whisperer, Brad Pattison.  If you haven't heard of him, check this out:  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=uYXOnoRr0D...    Personally I consider Brad to be more of a Dog Torturer, than Whisperer.    What do you guys think?

I've got 4 rats, 2 of them are really friendly, as nice as you could ever want them to be. the other 2  I adopted because they needed to be re homed as their owners we're moving apparently. I had to keep them apart from the other 2 because they we're aggressive to them. I tried my best with them but they never really became close with me. One of them sadly died the other week so ones now on its own.      I just bought a new 2 month old baby rat and shes lovely.       But when the lone rat is out she runs straight over to her cage and hisses and tries to attack her, which i don't understand because i know shes lonely after losing her cage mate so why wouldn't she want the company.      My other 2 rats have taken to her fine, and they've all had the same amount of time meeting her.      Will this rat ever be as nice as the others and will she ever relax enough for me to trust her with a new cage mate

20090202144941AAmPrbH	Pets;Other - Pets	What to do about a veterinary wrong doing ? ?	My dog was diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma on the wrist of his right forelimb. The biopsy showed that this type of cancer must have originated in the nerve sheath. The lump was on the rear side of his wrist. The vet suggested that he can remove it. He peeled the lump off and removed some but he could not go any deeper. He called me saying that the lump can not be removed because it is very deep. I asked him what will he do if this is his dog ? the dog is 13 years old yellow lab. He said, I will take him home and as long as he is not in pain I will let him continue and if he is in pain I will put to sleep. Finally, I had to put the dog to sleep 4 days after I noticed that the cancer at least doubled in size and spread on the top of his hand. I discovered that both vets who attempted the surgery did not follow the right approach when trying to remove the lump. The right approach is not to cut thru the cancer itself but cut into the area which is not infected with cancer utilizing at least 3 cm margin on boundaries and 2 cm in depth. Instead, they pealed off the cancer itself and this why is returned back with vengeance 4 days later. The questions are: is it possible that both vets did not know the simple facts of how to deal with cancer removal ? how and to whom I should file a complaint ? they both put the dog under a needless pain and they most likely knew in advance that they will not be able to remove the lump ! please help with your thoughts.

He was the first one to   come up to me and play:) right there i knew he was the dog that I wanted. He was playful and he was full of energy, But he was smaller than the other puppies. The breeder told me that he was born 38 minuets after all of them were born. So she said he was the runt. when I picked him up i check to see if his gums were pale, but they were bright pink. I also looked at his eyes and checked his ears.   And what my question really is, is that is it true that runts always get sick? i've heard that they also die very fast? is that true or is it just a myth? the only thing i am worried about is the tiny bump on his head.   I'm taking him to the vet, maybe one of his siblings bit him or something because when i got there they were all gaining up on the "runt" and biting him.       Thank you so much.

He's a persian and his butt was totally exposed with this groom, so we thought eww whatever, i'll never be comfortable holding him again, but I guess we'll have to deal with this nastiness.      But today, three days after, he smells fine.      What could have happened at the groomers?

20090202150311AA3wdIy	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog "freak out" on her leash at random?	On occasion, while walking my larger breed female dog she will positively spazz out, to put it bluntly. I found a similar question on Yahoo! Answers about a dachshund, but my situation is somewhat different. My dog is a year and half, extremely well socialized, and usually mild-mannered and calm. She walks well on a leash with no tugging or pulling, heels when told, and will sit to be introduced to new people. She is not dog aggressive, human aggressive, or cat aggressive, and does not offer to chase small animals. However, sometimes she will begin bucking and thrashing on her leash without warning. She will chew on her leash and/or harness, and cause a major uproar.      We've switched fabrics of harnesses and collars, and always make sure they're well adjusted. What could possibly account for this irrational behavior? There is no certain stimuli that is always present, sometimes people around and sometimes we're alone on a trail. Any insight is greatly appreciated.      Other info: She is spayed, healthy and checked annually by a vet, and knows basic obedience.

20090202150625AArVyQN	Pets;Birds	I just bought a new Eclectus parrot, how do I stop her from biting every time I try to touch her?	Today is my second day with her, she's like a year old.  Yesterday she was very sweet, and let everyone pet her with hardly even a couple nips (and they really were just barely nips, basically putting her beak around your finger, not even any pressure.)  Today she is a lot more finicky.  She won't let me even touch her.  She doesn't bite too hard but she definitely does NOT like it.  She won't even come out of the cage and sit her the perch.  I was wondering if anyone has advice on what to do to stop the nipping and let me handle her?  Or should I leave her alone?   Also, she was supposed to me MY pet, not really a family pet.  But I feel like everyone is kind of around her.  To be specific, mainly really only my mom.  She took her to the vet today and the vet said that she needs lots of time outside the cage(which I think i can certainly provide her with at least 3 hours a day), but my mom decided to take her downstairs and let her perch on a coat rack.  And that really upsets me for a couple of reasons:      1.  This was supposed to be my bird.  Not a hers.  And I don't want her to bond to my mom and not me, and have her only want to be handled by my mom because that would really ruin everything for me... ]:(      2.  And she won't even let me touch her or get her out of the cage without constantly nipping at me, yet she let my mom take her all the way downstairs and sit her on a perch?  That just seems to me like she would be tolerating my mom much more then me.      And i hope that doesn't sound selfish or that I don't want my bird to like my mom....but I really don't want the bird that was supposed to be MINE, and let me take care of it and love it, end up not even letting me touch it, yet it is in love with my mom!  Thats not right!!!!!      Any advice/help would REALLY help!!!!!!! Thanks!!!!!
20090202150711AAt4WI3	Pets;Fish	Why did all my goldfish die in that certain place?	My tank is a rectangle, and threes a filter stuck onto the wall, in the middle of the face length ways (if that makes sense)   Every time I bought a goldfish, after a day or two, they used to hide behind the filter, like in between the filter and the far wall, the next day or so, they'd end up dead.   Why did they always go there?      Thank you!
20090202150842AAXTxwX	Pets;Other - Pets	Does anybody have a story about their dog?	i do!!   and here it is.      about 2 years ago, while i was out cleaning our front yard, i had my German Shepherd/Rottweiler, Lucas, outside with our fence locked up. for added security, he was leashed to a tree with a decent amount of space to move around. some random guy pulled over his truck and parked in front of our driveway. this drove Lucas crazy because the guy was on Lucas' "territory". so anyway, Lucas started jumping around and going crazy, snarling and snapping at the guy. now, mind you the guy is talking to me and im just looking at him while Lucas is tied with a little leash to a thin tree. the guys asking me random questions and im just like "whatever". throughout all his talk, i heard him mention something about how his dog will teach my dog what a real man is like. i was baffled by that comment. finally, i headed back towards my house and the guy offers to give me his number so he can call my parents. i turned around, and told him to shut his mouth before he regretted ever talking to me. this made the man step out his truck and enter our yard.      i was afraid, and that only made Lucas crazier. the guy stopped and started taunting Lucas in very disturbing ways. then the guy walked toward me and attempted to grab me. i kicked him and he only tightened his grip. Lucas finally snapped his collar off and lunged at the guy. ripping at his thigh. i was relieved that the guy was off of me. but then i was worried because now his attention was on my Lucas. Lucas is tearing at him and the guy is ordering me to order my dog off. somebody in the car opened the door and a huge (now when i say huge, i mean HUGE!!) monster looking dog bounded out and tackled Lucas. my hearts was really racing. i did what my reflexes told me to, and that was to grab a stick and whack that monster dog whose breed was unknown. i hit the dog until another guy pulled him off of Lucas and brought him back into the car. Lucas wasn't harmed much and the other one barely had a scratch. the first guy scrambled to the front gate and Lucas got up as soon as the man closed his car door and sped off. Lucas chased the car and didn't come back for 2 days. i was terrified as to what my parents reaction might be. i called everyone in my neighborhood that i knew and i asked them to keep an eye out for Lucas. nobody returned my call with any good news.      those 2 days passed and the house was very empty without him. when he returned, i was overjoyed and so was everyone else.               yes its a long story, but im assuming all the stories i'll get in this answer will be just as ling, right?      :]

The person I got him/her from didn't really know much about them and though I know more, this is my first Dragon.      Anyway, this has happened twice now and I'm not sure if these are eggs or not.      First of all, my Dragon isn't tunneling or anything, doesn't seem to be making a nest of any sort either.      Secondly, these "eggs" are oval shaped, kind of oblonged, and are yellow. I mean banana yellow.       I searched on Google Beaded Dragon eggs, but none came up yellow. There's about 12 or 15 of them. Anyone have any ideas??      Thanks

My nieces won them at the carnival. Well I got the carp fish and it was all good until about 2-3 months later the tank was a foggy dirty color and so i changed the water again (I change half the water every week on all my fish tanks). Well my fish had the poor water disease because i hadn't got to change it before i left for the weekend about 2 weeks ago then i scrubbed down the tank after all my fish got better. Note only the carp has this red blood like appearance. i had gotten a fantail calico before i left. well 2 sundays ago i got another fantail calico (this one is mostly white n orange w. few spots my first one was covered in spots). well my tank is white again and i thought it was because of cleaning the water. I asked what was up with it before. but I cleaned the tank last wednesday and its almost been a full week and between saturday night and tonight its really foggy and smells bad. The tanks are in my room n that ain't good. any ideas?

20090202153052AAorEkN	Pets;Dogs	Help.Chihuahua-paralized?Arthr…	My 7 year old male chihuahua ,seems to over the past couple of weeks, has increasingly lost his mobility. His legs started collapsing under his body randomly, but he would eventually continue walking normally.(He's not overweight) This has become more frequent now, and as of today he couldn't stand up to eat his food from his bowl.    A lot of people have suggested it be arthritis, but I don't think so since he's not old, more like middle aged..?I feel his legs and arms and they're very limp. He usually doesn't like me messing with his legs, but now he doesn't even notice, as if he doesn't feel it! This makes me think he's becoming increasingly paralized.      I haven't gone to the vet yet, because I'm afraid of what they'll say.   They usually don't seem to be sincere about my pet's matter when they give you hundreds of dollars of a vet bill.I really don't want him to get into an expensive treatment...      Just let me know if any of your dogs have experienced this, and what did you do..he doesn't seem to be in pain, just easily frustrated that he can't hold himself upright.
20090202153055AAiwP10	Pets;Dogs	English bulldog's face fold -- black gunk? ?	I recently adopted a 6-year old English Bulldog (around Christmas). When I got him, one of the folds on his face seemed to need attention, so I have been cleaning it daily with no luck. I started out with a q-tip and apple cider vinegar and applied it directly to the fold. That didn't seem to help, so I ordered something called "pledgets" by Malaseb. They're basically medicated pads that you can use for lots of purposes. They really aren't helping either, though.      I've read about bulldogs being prone to yeast infections in their folds, but I'm not sure that a yeast infection is his problem. Every time I wipe the fold, I get crusty black gunk out. Is that typical of a yeast infection??       I will take him to the vet if I can't get it to improve, but wanted to try to fix it myself first. It's a fairly deep fold and deeper than the one on the other side of his face. Any advice would be awesome.

20090202153555AAIiOJz	Pets;Cats	WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT MY SITUATION?	Just over 3 weeks ago I adopted a 5 year old female Himaylan from a local animal shelter. When I first brought her home she was scared, in hiding, and not eating which is to be expected. After making several attempts at getting her to eat by offering different cat foods, tuna, and chicken I grew increasingly concerned when she was showing no interest in any kind of food at all. So last Fri. I took her to the vet. The vet was surprised that she was even still alive after going that long without eating. He looked her over and didn't find anything wrong but then he listened to her heart and said her heart doesn't sound good at all. :-( He gave her a shot to increase her appetite and sent me home with a high cal. wet food and told me that he wants me to bring her back in on Tues. (tomorrow) and have the other vet listen to her heart for a second opinion. When I got her home Fri. I started force feeding her and then before I went to bed that night I put some food in her dish just incase she decided to have some over night. To my surprise I woke up Sat. morning and her food dish was empty! So I hurried out to the kitten and refilled it and sure enough she was gobbling it down! It's now Mon. and she's been eating great ever since Sat. and along with her improved appetite she's not hiding anymore and is starting to act like a healthy cat should. I'm dreading the visit to the vet tomorrow. My vet advised me that if she does have a bad heart that I'll have to take her back to the shelter which is just breaking my heart. I guess I'm just hoping that maybe her heart sounded bad because she is so mal nourished. I'm so scared of losing my kitty especially after watching her improve so much after the last couple days. :-(

Then I turned and saw him mounting her, which he has never done, and he looked partially aroused. Nothing happened, as I caught it immediately, but Heidi has not yet gone into heat. I absolutely do not want puppies. I am keeping Heidi inside until she is old enough to get spayed, but after today I am wondering if I should let them play together very much. I know dogs using mounting as showing dominance, so I am wondering if maybe that is all he was doing. Is it normal for an adult male to try and mount a female puppy that has never gone into heat?

I've had them for about a month. They've lived together the whole time. They're a few months old, probably not even half a year, yet. They were all in the same cage when I got them, so I never 'introduced' them.      My mom says she thinks they probably fought. What I'm worrying about right now, though, is the bleeding. What do I do?

20090202154924AAWRZGf	Pets;Other - Pets	I'm afraid raccoon has distemper. It didn't acknowledge me and moves slow?	I have talked with some wildlife control workers and they said it may be tired if it has been out in the daylight all day or it may have distemper.  The weather has been extremely cold with ice and snow.  I didn't notice that it's eyes and nose were runny.  I'm hoping it's just tired.  I put a little food out for it and it very slowly started trying to eat.  Is it possible that it is just tired and will be alright or does it sound like distemper?  I have fed it outside - on and off- for the past several months since it was a baby.  I know I should not have started feeding it but it was winter when it was young and its mother left it.  I'm just really sad that it may be dying.  Does anyone know about raccoons? What should I do?

I am leaning towards blue spot stingray, but I know they are not very hardy. My LFS can get them locally, so I take that as they are in a wholesaler somewhere; does this mean they will be healthier as I bet the wholesaler has to keep them alive long enough to sell them to stores. Is there any other sharks and rays that might be good for a 180 gallon tank?

(over 200) im almost 13. they would be at my moms, cuz i have a cat at my dads. i could clean the cage when i leave my moms, and clean it as soon as i get back. (i switch houses every 3-5 days.)     i could give them extra blocks of wood, and branches from trees that i know are untreated. my mom said that she would feed and clean the water every day before she goes to work. i was also going to put up the effort of litter training them, any tips?    so can i still have 2 guinea pigs?

20090202162650AAzvc5S	Pets;Dogs	(Any vets out there?) opinions, educated guesses, anything helpful Im desperate. ?	My dog Hunter, will be 2 on April first. He has had quite the battle in his past. I adopted him from my local shelter. His mother was malnourished when she was pregnant with him and his brothers. When I first took him home he was 6 months old. He has had teeth issues, eye issues, and now urine issues.       Most of his teeth have bin removed because they didn't form properly. They were like crocodile teeth. Now his teeth are as good as they can be, every 6 months he visits the dentist just to be sure.       With his eye, as I had said above. He was born without a teer duct, so his eyes would crust over, to the point he wasn't able to open them. But we a has paid for his surgery. (I'm not a vet here, but I will try to describe it.) That connects a small plastic tube to where his tear duct was supposed to be. To where it drains out. If the surgery didn't work, there was a high possibility that he would loose his eye. After some 6 long months of recovery, he gets to keep his eye. With some small goop in the corners of his eye. He is doing fine now.      Hunter's bathroom schedule has changed rapidly over the last few weeks. He needs to go outside every 2 hours, no matter the amount of water he drinks. When I take him outside, he pees like he never had a pee in his life. Its a lot, and it takes like 10 min for him to finish it all up. Then usually he will run around a bit, then he pees again.      I've taken him to the vet, they thought it was just an infection. So they asked me to get a sample, and I did. I filled a large Tim Horton cup with his pee. They said it was to watered down. (but it was darker then oil.) So they asked us to see that he only drinks 2Leters of water a day, no more. With another dog, and a cat, it was difficult. But we got through it. Were finishing up some pills that were supposed to help him with his pee issues.       But it seems it only got worse. Now instead of a steady flow, its just a dribble, and it takes 20min no joke for him to finish it up. Were booked at the vets later this week, to see what tests he can do. I was just wondering if anyone has experienced anything remotely like this. Any advice, or insight would be greatly appreciated      Im asking again in attempts to get more oppinons.

20090202160215AAnUBNp	Pets;Fish	HOW do I take care of my 2 fish tanks! Please!!! I don't know anything?	I have a 10 and a 2.5 gallon tank and all I know to take care of them is vacume their poo up and change the filter when needed. And of course feed the fish, but aside from that, sadly I'm clueless. I'm sure I'll get scolded for that, but yeah.    Recently I had a guppy apacolypse occure. I got 4 new females stuck 2 in the 10 gallon and 2 in the smaller tank. I left to ski for the weekend and my mom was in charge, I come back and my catfish & all my guppies were dead in the smaller tank! Only 1 guppy & my algea eater survived. What should I do now about this tank? & what could have happened?    IN the other tank I was confounded as I found fish dead stuck onto the tube that sucks the water into the filter. I even found 1 that was still alive and trying to swim out, what is going on with this thing?!? When I touch it, the suction isn't strong at all I can't even feel it. But almost all my fish had scar marks on their tails from I can only assume getting sucked in. How do I fix this!?!?    To add the the rapid death of my fish in the big tank shortly after the 2 new fish had been introduced they both died and my fish started developing these weird patches of white that looked like fungi or something that was growning on them. And that's when they started dropping like flys. Their gills we're red and right before they died they'd lie on their backs breathing rapidly. Every fish I had 6 guppies, 3 neon tetras, 2 orange tetras, & 3 of those common orange fish all died save for my little catfish Earl.    What do I do now!? And how can I prevent this from happening again?

I have heard a lot of complaints about them, but I can't knock it until I try it and the visit was the cheapest I could find. Anyway I wasn't able to pay for everything all at once and my dog had ear infections along with the infection on his scrotum that he came in for. I took care of the scrotum thing with meds, but I want to come back to take care of his ears. They quoted me about $150 which would include the visit (discounted because it's a follow-up), the ear swab test, and the meds. She did the estimate with the highest priced ear med to be safe. Is that a good value or am I getting ripped off? I live in Florida so whatever the average cost is here for vets I don't know. Please help me to not get ripped off!

Every time I apply it, the hair at the back of her neck comes out in little clumps (she is longhaired). Now she has a small bald patch there. I did tell the vet when it started happening but he didn't pay much attention to it so i thought it must be common and that the hair would grow back but now I'm shocked to see that she has a patch which is completely bald. It is covered up by all her surrounding long hair which is why I never noticed before. Is it a side-effect of frontline and is it common and what can be done about it? (I have booked her into the vet for friday.)

20090202162258AAaXFcd	Pets;Cats	How do I stop my cat from spilling her water? ?	I have tried every kind of dish available - including the non spill with the rubber rings. It spills. She loves spilling her dish over and watching the water run down the floor. She jumps in the tub after I bath to watch the last of the water run down the drain. She sits in a dry tub just watching the drain. But get a drop of water on her fur and she bolts. Right now I'm using a 3 litre stainless steel stock pot for her water, which looks just ridiculous. Help!

20090202162805AAoX9rX	Pets;Dogs	How do I stop my dog from peeing in his own bed?	My dog is 1.5 years old lab/collie mix and we recently rescued him from the shelter. He has been great except he pees on his bed. He is neutered, and he doesn't pee anywhere else in the house. He will actually go to the door when he wants us to let him out. But even seconds after he has come inside he will go straight for his bed and pee. We always catch him and take him outside immediately where we give him lots of praise for going outside. When ever he goes outside we praise him. We are working on crate training him, and had to take the bed away from the crate. He no longer pees in his crate, but will pee on his bed right in front of us. He does not pee on any  furniture bc he isn't allowed up on it and the issue is not him peeing in my bed. We have another dog, a female. They get along great, and don't seem to have any issues sharing. The love to cuddle up and don't care what bed they are on...   Any ideas on how to correct this, or why it is happening?
20090202162832AAJ3heK	Pets;Fish	Betta has damaged tail?	Just now, my father told me about something about my male betta. Upon checking on him, I noticed almost all of his fin was lost and I'm worried about him. He can still swim normally.      He lives in a 10 gallon long tank with two undergravel filters and is planted with 4 valisneria. The tank was cycled since December. His tankmates are 2 ghost shrimps and a Bolivian Ram.      My betta has been in the tank for only about 3 days. I don't think it was the Ram since I didn't see any signs of aggresion between the two or by him except that my Betta avoids him when he gets close so of all. I suspect it was the shrimp since at one time, upon adding some several (possibly) Java Moss pieces, one of them immediately snatched it when it got close and tried to eat it. I think one of them managed to catch my betta's tail when he was asleep. I feed my betta BettaMin and some occasional tubifex worms. I don't think its fin rot since there's no sign of rotting.      PH is 7.5 while Ammonia and Nitrite is zero. Nitrate is about 10. Also, the tank is not heated but I have a heater in my room. I change the water about 20 - 30% every two weeks. I use Tetra AquaSafe with one removing Chlorine and heavy metals, while the other also removes Chlorine and Chloramine.      Right now, he is in this large bowl with a Water Wisteria that is floating (not sure of the size of the bowl though I suspect about 2 to 4 gallons). To try to help the cycle (since the bowl was not cycled), I added some Rocks with some (brown algae growing on them that I could not remove) from my 20 gallon planted tank (running for about 3 months).      What should I do to help him heal back his tail?

But, believe it or not my husband and I are working on opening up a pet store by this fall!        We were wondering what you would like to see in "YOUR IDEAL PET STORE "  Products, services, animals, etc....           The only animals we will not carry will be Dogs & Cats.  We will be working very closely to a very good adoption group in our area.    These are the animals we will carry:  fish ( salt & fresh), rodents ( hamsters, rats, mice, rabbits, Guinea pigs, and chinchillas), reptiles & small birds.     We can not carry ferrets, gerbils, heghogs or Sugar gliders. These animals are illegal to own, sell or buy in the state of California. We will also not carry food or supplies for these animals either.       I would love to hear your suggetions and ideas.  And ideas on how to design the pet store from the inside out.      The name of the pet store is: LITTLE PETS    Thanks for your help and have a great week!  Jennifer  Cottonwood, CA

20090202114224AAtIzyL	Pets;Dogs	My chihuahua is bored.?	I'm the mama of a medium/large chihuahua. She weighs about 10-12 lbs.   Anyway, I've noticed that she's completely BORED.  I try to avoid taking her out (she's paper trained) because I live in NYC and so far it's been FREEZING. My mother has planted the bug into my head that she could die from the cold.     I've noticed the boredom increased exponentially since we stopped playing outside mid-fall. Is it ok to take her out, at least to do her business and a few minutes of fresh air (Of course I would dress her in a shirt and her faux leopard coat.)? I wonder, because I never see chihuahua's out in this weather.     I guess I just want some reassurance from other small dog parents that she'll be ok with just a little exposure.    Anyone?

Do they do that sort of thing?  The pet store associate never said anything about this, nor did the book I read.  Could his tail possibly gotten stuck in the cage somewhere?

20090202114644AAM5mBd	Pets;Other - Pets	Introducing a stray dog to a cat?	My cat is really good with dogs and tolerates them most of the time. I have a 10 year old terrier mix and a pit bull that chases after him and he just takes it.   I am now adopting a Rotty/Pitbull mix I found a stray from the local shelter. The only thing they tested negative about her was her food aggression (which I can understand being a stray and protecting your food)...they usually are good with testing for other animals like dogs and cats because there are many animals waiting to be adopted that cannot live with other dogs and kitties.      But I am still nervous to bring her home to my cat.  They even insured me she is fine by taking her in the cat room - she refused to go near the cats.  They were of course crated.  I'm just worried her instincts will kick in being a stray and chase my cat and possibly hurt it.   Is there any precautions I can take when bringing her home?

I have been looking for a dog for a while and met a really great 3 yr old male pit at my local humane society.  He seems like a great dog, but I was wondering that the pros and cons are of adopting one from the pound.  Also, I don't know a lot about their personalities because I've never owned one.    Can someone tell me a little bit more about them, aside from the usual "they're aggressive killing machines"

20090202122342AA7LCBs	Pets;Cats	Cat ****! .....HELP!?	I have a male cat (Merlin) that is almost 1 year old and has been neutered.  We have another cat (female) who is 2 years old.  We also have a Yorkie named Webster.  Up until about 3 - 4 months ago, everything was hunky dory! The cats and dogs got along fabulously!  With the exception that the male cat likes to pounce and try to play with the Yorkie who wants nothing to do with him.  Merlin is generally a loving cat and loves my husband.  We have two daughter's and I am 3 months pregnant with a third (we aren't finding out the sex).        My question is......Merlin (male cat) has been shitting under my couch or bed and even my daughter's bed.  We scoop out the litter box every other day and add a little fresh to it. (of course, I am pregnant and do not touch it and won't even when I am not, I leave this up to my husband and my two daughters). He hasn't had a change in food, but sometimes we catch him eating the dog food.  Could this make him have uncontrollable shitting episodes?  Could he sense that I am pregnant and be ticked off about that? Our routines haven't changed. No additional pets have been added. Nothing really has changed that would cause him to do this.      Has anyone ever experienced this?  My smeller is out of this world and I can smell it as soon as the terd is leaving his butt!  My husband loves the cat and won't let me get rid of him.  I am at my wits end. I won't live in a house that smells like cat ****.  Any advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated!

20090202165502AArklDP	Pets;Dogs	My parents have two dogs, and a new puppy has brought the middle dog to bite the eldest in aggression. Help!?	The two dogs were by themselves for a few years, as they are only 5 and 6 years old. The oldest dog gets along perfect with the puppy but the middle dog has had a very difficult time adjusting to the new puppy. The middle dog tends to bite the eldest when toys or playing is involved. This is about the fifth bite since the new puppy came along and we just don't know what to do! We love them all dearly...

Please help! =)      So, ok, I go to this riding barn and we have a drill team. It's really important to me because all of my friends who left the barn are coming back just for drill team so I really want to be on it again. It's a VIP sort of thing too. Only girls who get asked to be on it can sign up, so I really want to be on it... LOL! did I say I really want to be on it? =)            ok si here's the problem, my parents are thinking on not letting me! They say that they already do soo much for riding, which really isn't true at all! They don't pay for lessons cuz I work up at the barn for my lessons, and they say that the lessons I earn are a privilege that they give me! I work my but off for 5 hours a day to get 40 minutes of riding and they say that they give it to me?! Every time I tell them this that I work so hard for riding they get mad and refuse to believe it!! Like they are paying for the lessons! Lessons cost $90 a month and for three years I have been working at the barn! Now I asked them if I can do drill team and they say probably not because I they give me soo much for riding already! All they pay for is gas!! And I get my license in a month, so soon not even that! But when I asked them if I could do drill team they said that it costs too much ($140). Not a lot considering I get a horse to ride for three months or so, and tack, and the lessons the instructor gives for us when we make our performance! So that's not a lot... right? three years $90 dollars a month you'd think they'd let me do this, right? Well, when they said that money is an issue I said I would pay for it with the money in the bank I have from summer jobs (which my dad has actually taken like 200 bucks from! Idk why!!). They said they'd have to think about it, and that it was probably a no!!! and that they didn't think I should be allowed to do it because again this whole thing about them doing sooo much for me and riding!!!!! Hello! They pay for nothing!!!!! I work soo much and they keep telling me that they hand this to me and I should be grateful!! What the (insert word here)?!?!?!?!?      What do I do? how do I let them know how hard I work without them getting mad? How do I get them to let me be on drill team? How do I let them know that I have been saving them money without them thinking that i'm being selfish or whatever makes them mad when I tell them that I've been working and they've been doing next to nothing to fund my equine ventures? Help? Please? I wanna scream!
