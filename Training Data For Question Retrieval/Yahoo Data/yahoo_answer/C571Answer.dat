CIqwpLKQaa	go to a doctor.|`|Bg3lbGR1aa	If you can't see a doctor and want a quick fix.<br>  <br>  You'll need 3 things.<br>  <br>  Hydrogen Peroxide<br>  Dropper<br>  Aspirator (used for babies snot)<br>  <br>  Fill the Aspirator with HP, then fill the ear canal with it and leave it in their for 30 second. Use the dropper to take out the HP or simply tilt your head and let it drain out. Continue doing this until you no longer feel/hear the fizzing of the HP.<br>  <br>  Once you've reached that point, take the dropper and insert it into the ear (While holding the plunger tightly so it is ready to aspirate). By doing this, you are moving the blockage out, if you feel that it is not budging or too hard to remove... continue softening with HP.<br>  <br>  This may take several attempts, or even a while to get the clog/object out or close enough to where you may retrieve it using tweezers... but it will work. I'd recommend a friend/family member assisting you.<br>  <br>  If someone is there to help you, they can even take a flash light and look into your ear canal and locating the clog. If it's been softened, it will look like a white piece of dough (yuk)... and they can retrieve it with tweezers or a # 2 crochet needle.|`|T1JGLlU4aa	but some ear candles from an organic/health food store they are cool or you can put peroxide in your ears it bubbles they just tip you head so it all comes out on a washcloth<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309230416AA2jDtn&r=w">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

7oC5tO9kaa	I think it is natural but better safe than sorry!|`|a1pmr73vaa	maybe get a appointment with your doctor if you are freaking out and get a std check too.|`|AA10243366	You should by all means get checked out,but I know from this situation with my husband that it is probably normal.He was alarmed by a small lump he had never noticed before and the doctor told him thing tend to shift and move as you get older.I would suggest you try not to worry, and get checked out for own peace of mind. Save your worry energy for another time,you never know when your gonna need it!|`|shAXm2wdaa	ok..when i went for my checkup the doctor tells me to check like once a month to see if i have bumps, and she says if you do it, could be a sign of Testicle Cancer, or something, i cant really remember..but since its in the same spot...idk..so get them checked.|`|DOUWdX9Oaa	yea...get that checked out. i hope you're okay|`|rFsqt5VHaa	definitely get them checked out.. we have no idea unless we examine your balls in person, which we don't want to
8KbcQGL0aa	I completely understand your situation. I would also wager to say you are highly creative. Myself, I bridged the difficulties with math, it is one of my assets. I do many of the same things you do though and came from a family such as your's. Both my parents have passed on, but my father was very negative and my mother got overly anxious about little things. Sound familiar? My problem is related to a disconnection between my short term and long term memory. It's disabled me, mentally from main stream society, but not from my intellect. I can still write and create images so vivid with my words as to make your mind writhe in anticipation. Words are my paint and imagination my canvas.

52c34c700fb8026a167472bd5bdf8d00aa	I'm not going to look up medical research, but as long as you have indeed SLEPT in those 10 days, you should be fine. I believe the longest anyone has ever lived without sleep is about 10 days.<br>  <br>  As long as you are still entering into REM sleep and dreaming, your brain is resting.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	maybe you have adhd if you feel normal stayin awake allnight and you are not tired then that is not normal you should call your dr it could be something serious|`|kKOzl9nUaa	You will not die. May sure that from 6pm onwards no caffeine, no nicotine and guarana or energy drinks. You could be stressed but don't worry your body will catch up and you will eventually get the sleep you need.|`|7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	A lot of people have sleep problems, so you are not alone. You will not become mentally retarded or have permanent memory loss if you do not get enough sleep. Long term, lack of sleep could mess you up a little bit, but you will not die. Look up good sleep hygiene on google and see if there is anything you can do to improve your sleep habits or environment. Try relaxing and winding down for a few hours before you go to bed. You could always try drinking some warm milk or tea, or eating foods rich in tryptophan, such as poultry and peanuts. If you still cannot sleep after a few more days and it is starting to negatively affect your every day life, ask your doctor about sleeping aids or melatonin. Take them temporarily to get your body used to sleeping at a certain time again.
btXbFXyxaa	It;s very normal to feel nauseous when you start taking birth control, it still happens to me and ive been taking it for 2 years! There should be a little pamphlet that came inside the pill pack. Just take a look at it and see what the side effects say. All pills are different and some have weird effects.
LV75kgwraa	I'm not exactly sure what surgery you're talking about. First off, any type of surgery for cosmetic reasons will usually not be covered by any insurance plan. With the exception of breast implants after a masectomy. Most insurances do not consider this as "cosmetic". <br>  <br>  There are several different surgeries dealing with the cornea. Lasik is the most common of course. The price depends on where you go and what your Rx is. Usually the more complexed your vision is, the higher the price. "Chop Shops" (as I like to call them) usually advertise a starting price of $199 per eye! Don't believe everything you see! Most of these type of doctor's just want your money and their office is run like a factory line. A good, thorough opthalmalogist will normally charge about $2000+ per eye, again depending on your Rx and what needs to be corrected. <br>  <br>  Another surgery is a corneal transplant, also known as "penetrating keratoplasty". By the amount you stated, this might be what your talking about. Corneal transplants are VERY expensive! This is similar to having any other type of organ transplant surgery. You're put on a waiting list for a donor, they remove your cornea, surgically put the "new" cornea on, and hope that your eye accepts it. It can run about $10,000+ per eye for the surgery alone. This usually does not include post surgery visits or prescription medicine needed. Some insurances will cover a portion of the cost. And there are some insurance companies who still consider this surgery as "cosmetic" and will not cover any portion of it.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if Kaiser will cover either of these surgeries, but you can call them and ask! Hope this helps!

BOJv4DJNaa	Firstly Efexor & Lexapro are not addictive, Xanax is, it's an addictive tranquiliser/muscle relaxant from a different family of drugs & it is OK for extreme cases occassionally but it's not for long term everyday use due to it's addictive properties. Have a serious talk to your doctor about your physical symptoms & your psychological symptoms-especially your irrational & paranoid thoughts.  If your doctor is just a GP get a referral to a Psychiatrist who is more specialised & experienced. Medication is not always the only answer either, you may greatly benefit from psychotherapy counselling or group therapy & may also need to see a Psychologist. I suffered for many years with symptoms from Bipolar & Personality Disorder & I became addicted to tranquilisers, my behaviour got me in trouble with the law, I was in & out of jail & the psych ward, lost my job & car, went bankrupt, lost my home & ended up losing my kids. I had to go to Rehab & then did another 2 years of therapy & finally I turned my life around & I'm now studying to become a drug & alcohol counsellor & the court may be giving my kids back even though they were placed in permanent care until aged 18. I would not be the successful person I am today if I hadn't put so much hard work into my therapy. I used to be on multiple medications which never really helped much, now I just take Prozac. medication treats the symptoms but therapy gets to the cause. You may need to be on medication & there are many other more suitable medications available & you may need to try a few before you find one that works for you. Don't let your boyfriend get a vasectomy, he may want to be a father in the future. No doctor would tie your tubes if you've never had children & I assume you're still young. You may not want children now & due to the way you're feeling you only think that you might not be a good mother. You never know how you'll feel in the future & what may happen & change with your life in the future, so you don't want to be making such drastic descisions now at this point in time, that you may seriously regret later. I never really liked children much, or rather I thought they didn't like me, until I had my own & my kids were the best thing that ever happened to me. Although I lost them they were the inspiration for my recovery - I live for them. Talk to your doctor & start organising some counselling as soon as possible. Hope this helps. You deserve to be happy & enjoy your life without feeling so much distress.|`|U2LZDeKIaa	Some people do take drugs in the category Xanax is in, benzodiazepines, regularly for their anxiety. But there are two things to watch out for, one is that they can be addictive, and the other is that if you take it regularly you may build a tolerance to it and it may lose it's effectiveness. You can talk to a doctor about it. <br>  <br>  One thing you could try is getting a prescription for Xanax or Klonopin to take as needed, rather than taking it regularly. And if you get a prescription, don't take a higher amount than prescribed.<br>  <br>  There are other medications given for anxiety as well, there is one called Buspar, which is not a benzodiazepine, so it is in a different class than Xanax and Klonopin are. I don't think Buspar is addictive, but I am not sure. There are also the SSRI antidepressants, which are sometimes used to treat anxiety.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor.|`|BgOFPiAiaa	I think you should talk about this with your doctor not random people on the internet. This is a more professional problem that we can't help you with.<br>  <br>  You answered your own question.|`|Z9Df2SYqaa	I don't quite understand why your doctor would switch you from Effexor xr to Lexapro, they are both antidepressants but different kinds.  Effexor is an SNRI while Lexapro is an SSRI.  Both will hit seretonin in your brain but Effexor also hits norephinephrine.  Had Effexor stopped working for you?  What was the reasoning for the change?<br>  <br>  I can tell by what you wrote that you are extremely hard on yourself.  I bet you're very nice to other people though.  I had a huge phobia of pregnancy when i was growing up.  I figuered it was because I had a strict catholic upbringing.  But then I saw that it was more than just a pregnancy phobia.  I was paranoid of creating a new life.  Of making someone innocent have to suffer in this world like I do.  And I didn't want to be responsible for that.  I also knew if I got an abortion, I would never live with the guilt, even though I am not opposed to abortion at all for other people.  I didn't want to be guilty of playing god with someone else's life.  Maybe you feel the same.<br>  <br>  As far a Xanax - get yourself some.  You deserve it!  You should be able to have some Xanax available for yourself at all times.  Yes, it is addictive bla bla bla - but you have to use it regularly several times a day to become addicted.  You should be able to have some around for emergency use though.  And make sure you get Xanax and not another benzo like ativan or klonipin.  It is true that they are in the same drug class but nothing acts faster than Xanax, which is why Xanax is the best for panic attacks.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile Lexapro seems like it's not for you - maybe try a different antidepressant.  Notice I say try a "different" antidepressant rather than try a "new" antidepressant.  That's because the older ones sometimes work better.  Doctors are always given tons of samples for 'new' drugs because drug companies make money when the drug is new and only available in brand-name form, so they are hoping to get lots of new prescriptions.  Once a drug goes generic things change.  My main point is, it's very possible one of the older type of antidepressants will help you.  Like a tricyclic antidepressant.<br>  <br>  And if you don't have one, I highly recommend seeing a good therapist tht you like.  Especially one who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy.  They will teach you skills to cope with panic attacks, so eventually you'll need less medicine :)<br>  <br>  Hang in there<br>  -R-
ad8dOQVWaa	Yes I have, and I don't find it disgusting, just a bit messy (though no where near as messy as people who haven't seem to think it is.)  Takes us slightly out of the moment when I have to run downstairs to get a towel and lay it over the bed or pull out a tampon, but whatever.  Definitely helps my moons and cramps, and free extra lube, right?  I don't let my period stop me from having sex but I don't really go out of my way to have it then either.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Are you taking any kind of pain medications?   Some of those can leave you feeling like you are walking in a fog, as opposed to simply knocking you out to sleep.  Of course, the surgery itself can certainly take the mickey out of you as well.  You didn't say what sort of surgery you had done, but as a rule you can't just meddle with the innards and not have the body take notice.  Although surgery can repair many things, it still leaves repairs that only the body can take care of.  Repairs take a lot of energy, and that leaves you sapped.  If you aren't up to eating a full diet, all of this combined can sure make you feel like you are walking around in an uncooperative body.  Try just taking it easy for a bit longer yet.  It's not unusual for a person to feel physically improved before the body really is.  Give it a few days longer for your body and mind to agree on the state of things.
lxaZG74laa	It's great that you are concerned and loving. However, often we get caught up in our loved ones diseases and create our own. <br>  <br>  You have to take care of you. The frustration and worry over someone in his condition will take it's toll on you. Don't forget, that although he is suffering, he is still an adult. You are not "responsible" for him and you cannot live for and through him. You need someone you can talk to, confide in, and lead you in taking care of yourself.

pUpUkX14aa	It depends on how many days a week you are working out.  I wouldn't recommend you working the same muscle groups out the same day.  You should give those muscles a break so they have time to repair and build up.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with working out twice a day.  Many body builders spend several hours a day in the gym doing just that.  Just be careful not to over train.  Make sure that you give your muscles that you just worked out 48-72 hours of rest to recover.  If you are still sore after 72 hours then chances are you over did it and caused tissue damage.|`|XXp5dMZMaa	You rest atleast 48 hrs before working out the same muscle group. You should give some time for your muscles to recover. So go for working out a diff muscle group|`|SQv8DGb7aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I recommend that you do not do any more exercises for the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  It is a myth that you will gain more muscle if you do weight- lifts more than on one occasion. <br>  <br>  I had a friend that went to the gym 6 days a week for 3 months and I promise you, he did not change much!!<br>  <br>  I did the exact 3 months with a completely different approach by doing 2 different programs in a week. (Excerise A will consist of Bench press, shoulders and legs. Exerise B will consist of Biceps,legs and lats)<br>  <br>  I only did one of the exercises every 2nd day along with Interval training(fast running,slow running) and I was bigger,more ripped and fitter than my friend that over did it completely.<br>  <br>  Reasons:<br>  1. Muscle do not grow bigger or quicker when you over exercise it<br>  2. When you concentrate on one part of your body the whole time, you will not see any results come through because your muscles NEED TO REST FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO GROW! SIMPLE<br>  3. When my friend went to the gym, he did something called "slow cardio"- which means, running or cycling between 30mins- 2hrs at a consistent speed and that prevented him to lose weight for ripping purposes and at the end not getting bigger muscles.<br>  <br>  For you to be able to build muscle fast- Change your muscle group every 2nd day for a week and then the following week, start of with the one exercise you ended with the previous week.(Example: Exercise A,B,A then B,A,B)<br>  <br>  Do this for a Month and then switch to a different program.<br>  <br>  NOTE: For you to be able to build fast, you must adjust your programs every 4 weeks because the body gets use to the exercise and you will not get where you want to be.<br>  <br>  Hope all this will give you an idea of how to build faster.

c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	Thrombocytosis is a disorder in which your body produces too many platelets (thrombocytes), which play an important role in blood clotting. Also known as reactive thrombocytosis, the disorder can affect children and adults.<br>  <br>  Reactive thrombocytosis occurs in response to an underlying condition. Thrombocytosis isn't likely to cause symptoms.<br>  <br>  Your treatment for thrombocytosis depends on the underlying condition that causes it. In most cases, your platelet count will return to normal after the condition is resolved.

DYQfxTl2aa	strengthening your back muscles will help your back problem now, but strengthening your stomach will help you in future as these are the muscles you want doing most of the work. test the theory by touching your toes and tightening your abs and pushing yourself back up with them , you will find it much less strenuous on your back, same when u kneel down.|`|ixHwF4apaa	it seems|`|AA11173395	You admit that his treatment is working, you are in no pain and feeling better.  It seems obvious that the man knows what he is doing.  Trust me, he's not interested in your belly fat.|`|VnCvn1mnaa	he is your doctor, you should probably do what he says.  you said something about belly fat?  well if you are overweight im sure that has something to do with your back pain and scolioisis. Maybe thats his way of telling you losing weight might help with your back problems.  Believe me I dont have scoliosis , but an out of whack back, and if I was overweight I could see that complicating things even more than they already are.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I am sure there is a reason. Actually, belly fat does put excess strain on your spinal cord, and it pulls from a strange angle. <br>  <br>  Chiropractic medicine is about straightening your spine by strengthening your muscles. That is why you go say 3 times a week at first and so on... because as your muscles get stronger, you don't need as much help keeping your spine straight.|`|IAkEyPb9aa	If he can't justify why he is telling you to do these things he shouldn't be telling you to do them. <br>  You are entitled to question him.<br>  If he doesn't like it move on and see another practitioner who can handle it. <br>  For what its worth its unlikely he is targeting your belly. During cycling the spinal muscles do get a work out as well as your legs. Part of our job as practitioners is to educate and explain why we should do certain things. That does not include prescribing things and expecting a patient to do so without question. <br>  Some times I get frustrated when I have a patient who just doesn't get the advice I give. My job is to calmly explain to them why on their level without being condescending.<br>  <br>  I seem to manage it a vast majority of the time. So should your Chiropractor.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	I think it's time for you to seek another chiropractor.   No medical professional should ever object to answering an honest question a patient asks in regard to their condition or treatment.  Even if you were doubting him, he still owes you an honest answer to an honest question.  It is still a matter of trust, and it certainly doesn't sound like you trust him now- either enough to believe his advice is sound, nor enough to ask questions you are entitled to have answers to.  To be honest with you, I think you would benefit from an evaluation from a Doctor of Osteopathy more.  A D.O. does manipulations and such much like a chiropractor, but with the additional training similar to that a tradition M.D. receives.  They also have the ability to prescribe medication, and will do so when it is called for.  They are more likely to prefer exercise and manipulations, lifestyle changes and other non-medicine solutions first.  They would also be trained to read x-rays a lot better than a chiropractor.  Regardless of who you chose to see, though, this particular chiropractor and you do not have the sort of doctor/patient relationship that is likely to benefit you.  And if you are going to pay to see somebody 3 times a week, you really ought to see somebody willing to work with you and answer your questions.  It is your body, after all- not to mention your money paying for it.

And good luck.|`|AIsvSsEKaa	Some people with low blood pressure are in peak physical condition with strong cardiovascular systems and a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke. But low blood pressure can also signal an underlying problem, especially when it drops suddenly or is accompanied by signs and symptoms such as: Dizziness or lightheadedness, Fainting, Lack of concentration, Blurred vision, Nausea, Cold clammy pale skin, Rapid shallow breathing, Fatigue, Depression, Thirst.<br>  <br>  Low blood pressure on standing up. This is a sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from a sitting position or if you stand up after lying down. Ordinarily, blood pools in your legs whenever you stand, but your body compensates for this by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels, thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain. But in people with postural hypotension, this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision and even fainting. <br>  <br>  If the symptoms continue, you need to ask your doctor about it. According to the Mayo Clinic, most of the time there is nothing to worry about, but you need to know the status of your health.

ROWSzTknaa	It is really hard to diagnose in children as the first manic episode is usually not seen until the 20's. Children are often missed diagnosed with A.D.H.D. I'm assuming because of the hyperactivity. I became depressed as a preteen that's one thing to look for. It's not always just teen moodiness. I was very socially withdrawn, even at a young age. This doesn't apply to everyone with bipolar. Everybody is there own person. The best bet for the child to have a good quality life is early intervention. See a psychologist. If it's not bipolar then you'll know. Trust me I wish me parents would have sent me as a child.|`|LDEa6yDcaa	most likely you would notice a personality change without reason. a child may be happy one minute and all of a sudden he/she may be ready to bite someone's head off and maybe that person hasn't even spoken to the child. sometimes all it takes is to say 'good morning'.<br>  the child may act as if he/she is in deep meditation.these type of people are very hard to please and nothing seems to ever satisfy them.<br>  if you think your child has these problems,please do yourself, the child aand everybody else a great favor!! seek medical help!!!<br>  there is medication to help avoid these attacks. usually they will take some timeto start working and the right dosage to be given, probably 30-45 days.<br>  good luck to you on this.<br>  the dj man said that.|`|Cl2nEDtZaa	My sister is bipolar so usually it involves changing mood really fast for no exact reason like going from being on top of the world to being one of the most depressed people you will ever meet.

I suggest you take the child to a professional doctor if you think they might have it!|`|O5KOwhovaa	"Bi-polar child" is another term for "completely normal child"|`|EDiJe38Taa	Most kids are misdiagnosed with bipolar. Parents and doctors want an excuse for misbehaving and un-disciplined kids.

I would really be hesitant if your kid is diagnosed bipolar. Do lots of research and get second opinions.|`|zPPYGv7Daa	Same as an adult.  Really high or really low.  But in my opinion most children act this way.  Children are still developing to learn how to control their emotions.  Thats what adults need to do- train and be patient.  I would wait until age 14 to determine if child is really bi-polar.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Bipolar disorder in children does NOT look the same as it does in adults.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	The answer is B release of atrial natriuretic factor.  <br>  <br>  ANF is a protein polypeptide hormone secreted by heart muscle cells. It's involved in the homeostatic control of body water, sodium, potassium and fat. It's released by muscle cells in the atria of the heart (atrial myocytes), in response to high blood pressure.  ANF acts to reduce the water, sodium and adipose loads on the circulatory system, thereby reducing blood pressure.

ItJzrvQ4aa	Kelloggs' Special K brand have been promoting their very own Special<br>  K Diet Challenge (for a number of years now). Not to be outdone, Kraft<br>  have "lose 10 pounds" emblazoned on virtually the entire line of<br>  "Post" brand cereals (called Eat 2 Lose 10)<br>  <br>  Both cereal "diets" are bold and upfront with their claims: "Lose up<br>  to 6 pounds in 2 weeks!" shouts Special K. Is this for real? Is it<br>  valid?<br>  <br>  The Special K Diet<br>  <br>  ? Eat a serving of Kellogg's? Special K?, Special K? Red Berries,<br>  Special K? Vanilla Almond, Special K? Fruit & Yogurt or Special K? Low<br>  Carb Lifestyle Protein Plus cereal with 2/3 cup skim milk and fruit<br>  for two meals a day. <br>  ? Eat your third meal as you normally do. <br>  ? For snacks, choose from fresh fruits and vegetables or a Special K?<br>  Bar. <br>  ? Consume beverages as you normally do.<br>  <br>  Special K claim that the diet is "based on valid research conducted<br>  at leading universities". In typical hard-sell fashion, they fail to<br>  provide the reference or provide a link to the "valid research". After<br>  some digging, I found the aforementioned study. <br>  <br>  Yes - People Lost Weight<br>  It made interesting reading, and effectively backed up some of the<br>  claims from Special K. According to my reading, the mean weight loss<br>  was less than 2 kg (4.4 pounds) in the 2 week period. <br>  <br>  A basic low fat diet<br>  So what's the magic? There is no magic. The women in the study ate<br>  less than they normally did. According to the study, the women in the<br>  Special K group were eating about 2200 kcals per day. When they<br>  started substituting the cereal meals they dropped daily intake by<br>  about 640 kcals per day. Furthermore, a lot of those calories were<br>  from fat (~39 grams or 351 kcals). <br>  <br>  Good or What?<br>  Personally I think incorporating some cereals into your diet can be<br>  good - but there are some caveats here:<br>  Satiety - From experience, I've noticed that wolfing down a bowl of<br>  cereal doesn't always curb the hunger pangs. However having a bit more<br>  protein in the mix does keep the pangs at bay.<br>  Nutrition - The simple truth is - Special K is better than what most<br>  people eat, but it still contains such gems as High Fructose Corn<br>  Syrup. Serving for serving, it has less potassium and fiber than oats,<br>  and more sugar. Compare here and here.<br>  <br>  The Claim<br>  "Lose 6 Pounds in 2 Weeks"<br>  <br>  The Interpretation<br>  "If you currently have a poor diet, but substitute it with our cereal<br>  - you may lose 4.4 pounds over the first two weeks. You will be<br>  probably feel very hungry while restricting your calories, and will<br>  may find eating cereal for dinner or lunch to be untenable after a<br>  while. Boredom could well set in. History shows that a low-fat,<br>  higher-carb diet can work, but in the long run it may backfire".<br>  <br>  That said - you could do a lot worse than eating cereal, skim milk,<br>  and fruit - it's a lot healthier than the average American meal...|`|tIldpr7vaa	its just based on the idea that a bowl of cereal has so few calories, Special K itself has no weight loss properties. U could go on the Coco Puff diet and still lose weight, its just a marketing gimmick.<br>  <br>  Just stick to healthy foods|`|oUbBOeCoaa	i cant tell you if it defo work or it defo not work for you, but the thing they say in the adverts, "you are more likely to lose weight if you eat a low fat breakefast than if you skip breakfast altogether" is true and from that yes it is possible to lose weight by eating special k, but there are a many of other cereals that would help you lose wieght better than special k would (such as bran flakes) becuase they atchually have a lower amount of fat than special k does. <br>  <br>  so yes it is possible for it to work but there are cereals that could help you even more so look at the labels on the cereal packets and compare them to see the amount of fat in them and other unhealthy things too. but it will only work if you make sure that you get enough exercise and other healthy meals and things as well.<br>  <br>  hope this helps x|`|xv2ScJDHaa	Actually, you don't need to diet as such in order to lose weight, the one method which definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today.

If you are not careful you will gain it all back.  This is a good short term "i have 5 pounds to lose" type of diet and that is all.|`|HQEn6jbnaa	diets don't work, reduce calorie intake by switching to smaller portions of healthier food, then increasing exercise and movement, ie: replace soda with water, or play basketball at the park for 3 hours on tuesday|`|ufh1hV7taa	wel i actually don't feel its as special as it sounds to be..the Kellogg's special k program provides you about 98% fat free meal(provided u use it along with fat free milk).inorder to achieve the 5 pounds in 2 weeks you need to eat an almost fat free third meal too..as its 2 bowls a day.. n then u need to perform a 30 min exercise..when all tis is combined together u attain the guaranteed weightloss.but this lost weight can come back wen u stop the program.i tink u can get a much improved result if you workout everyday n stop eatin all tos unhealthy foods..n regular exercise keeps fat away..there is nothin wrong in tryin the program but dont u think its betr u eat tasty healthy food n exercise ur way to health??|`|25EcKUjxaa	yea it does iv done it before i lost only about 5 pounds tho lol. answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225093107AAPEK6W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|sGW3bZBRaa	I am doing it and it works very well

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	From the way you describe it, it almost sounds more like an ingrown nail.  I have one on my left big toe, so I know exactly what you are talking about.  The ONLY difference is that instead of describing as a piece of skin, I would definitely describe mine as "nail."  But other than that, our symptoms match up perfectly.  If it is an ingrown nail, keep it trimmed very short and follow up with a doc when you have the chance.<br>  <br>  I just re-read your question and it could also be what a friend of mine has... she has these horrible little hangnails at the base of her fingernails that hurt like hell as well.  And if that is the case, the best thing you can do is don't pick at it, keep your hands clean and very dry, and moisturize only when necessary.  You can see a dermatologist if this continues to be painful for you.<br>  <br>  I hope some of this has been helpful for you.  Good Luck!!
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Are you sure the doctor told you to drain the abscess yourself manually??  As a rule, an abscess doesn't need your help to drain.  Your skin and body are happier as well if you don't meddle with it much either.  The most common way of dealing with an abscess is to apply moist heat, hot as you can stand, as often as you can do it.  That helps the body isolate and drain it all by itself.  That's much more efficient and safer than using hands and pressure- which can spread the infection beneath the skin or to other spots.   If it is still producing pus, then the infection is not entirely isolated just yet.  I think you should call and speak with the doctor again to make sure you understood what he said, and that the draining is something he wants you to do yourself.  Considering this spot isn't where the sun shines (or at least that's what it sounds like), it wouldn't be easy to do anyway.  Until you can speak with the doctor, I suggest moist heat applied to the area in question.  Heat helps increase blood flow, and that helps win the battle.  When the battle is over, the body will drain the abscess all on it's own.  The upside of that is that healing is faster and more efficient, and you don't end up with more spots or a worse infection.|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	Keep draining it.  I had an abcess a few months ago and it took about a week before it stopped draining.  Warm compresses and/or 2 HOT baths a day will help bring all that stuff to the surface and speed up the drainage a little|`|laVGEEeraa	If the doctor you saw did not refer you to the hospital, I wouldn't go just yet.  It depends on exactly what type of infection you have.  The antibiotics will only work on an infection with bacteria.  There is an infection that appears where folds of skin can occur like underarms or the groin called Hidradenitis Supporitiva (HS) that can cause extreme pain and antibiotics do nothing as there is no bacteria present.  Doctor's commonly prescribe antibiotics because they can help to stop the spread of the infection, but there is no known cure for HS.  You may try soaking the area or taking a bath (depending on where it is located) using Dreft.  I know this is laundry detergent but Dreft is used for washing baby clothes as it is not as harsh as other detergent and years ago people bathed in it.  I would re-contact your doctor and ask for a referral if they are unsure what to do.

If you make sure to wear protection and be safe, its less likely to transfer the STD. I don't have sex very often now, but im always upfront when we do.

Some people even get up and take more Ambien in their sleep, without even realising it. Besides, you should never have to put up with side effects when there is an alternative drug. I wouldn't recommend Valium though. I go so addicted and I was so sick when I stopped taking it|`|EN32vSsCaa	Headache is a documented side effect of Ambien (zolpidem).

Otherwise, talk to your physician, there are other alternatives available.|`|J3ijZxYGaa	It might be making you dehydrated in your sleep. Try drinking more water before bed?

Consistent ab workouts are great to strengthen the muscles of the stomach but will not completely help to make those muscles more evident.  <br>  <br>  You will see dramatic claims on T.V. about inches lost with their abdominal apparatus and you yourself may see some results with these machines but this is because it is forcing you into a cardiovascular workout.  Going from doing nothing to anything will improve your fat percentage to an extent and it is this factor that will help you make your abs visible.<br>  <br>  So instead of pulverizing your stomach everyday and risking potential injury from overtraining, limit your ab workouts to 3 times a week and shift the bulk of your energy towards more cardiovascular work.

Those protein shakes you have been consuming probably have been helping, since as you probably already know, protein is the bulding blocks of muscle.  If you want to be sure, you can go to a local health clinic or gym and have them perform a total body fat percentage test on you.  This will measure to see if your total body fat is in normal range.  In general, for a woman, the totals should be along the lines of this.<br>  <br>  32%+-obese<br>  25-31%-acceptable<br>  21-24%-fit<br>  14-20%-althetes<br>  anything less than 14% is unhealthy as these are your "essential" fats used to sustain a healthy life.|`|tIldpr7vaa	welll if ur arms r more muscular, then i guess it is.

dpgXzMenaa	An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure.  It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation.  You will *definitely* know when you have one.  There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm.  Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee).  The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Having vaginal sex alone isn't a very effective way to have orgasms for most women, because the vagina isn't the place where women's most direct sexual pleasure comes from.   The clitoris is.<br>  <br>  It might interest you to know that by the age of 12, 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that by age 15, it's 2/3 of them doing it *regularly* (many of them more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse.<br>  <br>  ... or that the very first thing sex therapists teach women who've never had an orgasm is how to masturbate - because that's the *only* sure fire way for a woman to learn how her body responds sexually and what will bring her to orgasm.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. <br>  <br>  Once you can have orgasms dependably when you masturbate, you can have them dependably whenever you have sex with a partner... either by giving them to yourself during sex or by teaching your partner what works for you so *he* can give them to you.<br>  <br>  Seriously. If you don't have orgasms alone... it's time you learned: how's your man gonna know how to get the work together with you if *you* don't even know what the job is?<br>  <br>  One thing you can do to find out is check out the "Female Masturbation" webpage at clitical-dot-com ... <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  (Actually, the entire section is incredibly valuable reading, but there's an awful lot of it to digest in one gulp.)<br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  Then you'll know what one is and how to have one, for sure.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Just because you squirted out some extra lubrication doesn't mean you had an orgasm.

vJXZgEnOaa	No maybe you just don't like the fruit.<br>  An allergy is when your body has an over reaction to a type of fruit.<br>  You usually start getting hives, and your mouth gets inflated. <br>  And everything gets itchy. If it is more severe than you can start wheezing and even die if your throat blocks up. <br>  I have the same as you do but with fish.<br>  I think it is a intolerance to it. Except with fish i start vomiting at just the smell, and if i eat it than its even worse. Think of it as a intolerance instead of a allergy. Make sure you get vitamin supplements from what your missing out on from your fruit though.|`|TkNIbhnraa	I'm no doctor, but I have some fruit allergies to watermelons, raspberries, and bananas and when I have a reaction, my mouth and throat get swollen and itchy and sometime I have the sensation of nausea.

9DzY3n7xaa	Very popular question..Seems a lot of people are misinformed or not taught at all, as i wasn't at a younger age. so heres my usual answer:<br>  <br>  You have Phimosis. To help with it, try stretching exercises, when erect just pull it back as far as it will go and hold for 5 mins. Do this a few times daily.. in the shower helps, and you should see results within days/weeks. Could also try, if its possible to pull back a bit, pull it back, grab the glands with two fingers and roll the foreskin up over the two fingers as far as it will go (when the ring of skin turns white). hold it there for 5 mins. Lubricant helps with this!. Or get a prescription from your doc for Betamethasone cream 0.05%. It's fairly common, and this should help. Also try rubbing vitamin E around the top and inside the foreskin, which may help elasticate it. If it's more serious, you may need a preputialplasty (alternative to circumcision but with no loss of looks, sensetivity or anything, and is less painful with a fast recovery rate. With a preputialplasty:they make a small incision vertically then horizontally in your foreskin, and stitch it up to have more space for your glans to appear without a total circumcision. This is a quick procedure they may even just do in a doctors office.. so may be possible privately.<br>  Speak to your GP about it.)<br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  **edit- make sure you do not pull it over the head till it is ready.. if you do, it may be too tight to reverse, and you will have a condition called paraphimosis, where the skin stops the blood flow, and then your only option is a circumcision. And if you are in the Uk, the cream isn't available. No steroid creams here are available without prescription. You have to use betamethasone 0.05%-0.1% for around a month or so..**|`|Ky7ibvX6aa	I'm a 22 uncircumcised male and remember having my foreskin pulled back by my doctor at a very young age. From what I remember it was not pleasant yet very necessary for a few reasons. One is cleaning of any smegma or dirt build up and to prevent any infection from occurring. I also believe it is important during intercourse for the foreskin to be able to retract or it may cause some pain, as you spoke of. I think there are more reasons then that, but these are some that I know of myself from experience. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is see a doctor about it asap. I think it is very important that the foreskin is able to retract with ease.|`|TgiLDFNeaa	You should see a doctor.|`|lyAJFW0Yaa	mine doesn't retract fully either when i'm erect. why does that matter?|`|7oF2o4q5aa	I agree with the guy with the red nose except for two things.  Actually a dorsal slit is what the procedure is called in urology and it is not a full circumcision, just a release of the foreskin.  While this could be done in the doctor's office, it is usually done under very brief anesthesia for patient comfort.  It can, however, be done as an outpatient (no hospital stay).  They will not do this while you have any active infection, however.  You should also use, instead of betamethasone cream, just over-the counter hydrocortisone cream 1%.  It does not require a prescription.
ufgv7oTjaa	The other answer is right... it doesn't clean drugs out of your system and that's a commonly misunderstood (and often purported) issue.<br>  Niacin has a flushing effect... that's all some people read and they run with it. What they don't look into is the fact that it's a skin-flushing effect (like when you get embarrassed or have a hot flash), not a body-cleansing flush. Niacin is good for cardiovascular health and cholesterol support... it has no impact on removing drugs from the system.<br>  <br>  From the research I've done, it seems that the ones who have passed their tests when using Niacin were just lucky as I've heard about many people who failed their tests when taking high doses of Niacin (which is both not recommended and VERY uncomfortable).<br>  The only way to get pot completely out of your system is to abstain for 30 days. It takes time for your body to process that and anything else may only take a couple days off that time. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|yULV67HDaa	basically it burns the **** out of ur insides and doesnt work, i hurts and sucks, if u want to pass a home drug test, use 2 drops of eyedrops, unless it is being sent to a lab
tGEMwgyBaa	It sounds like you might have broken off a portion of your tooth. When you run your tongue across it does it feel jagged? Sometimes when you bite down on something you can damage the nerve and the intermittent pain you are feeling is your damaged nerve trying to heal itself. You may have also fractured your tooth which you would not feel by running your tongue across your tooth, you would need to have an x-ray taken of the tooth and sometimes if it is a small fracture the x-ray may not pick it up. The best thing to do is call you dentist and ask for an emergency visit. This way they are only going to focus on the one tooth that is bothering you and it won't cost as much as a regular visit. By the way if it is fractured you may only need to have the tooth crowned to protect it from further damage. I hope this was helpful. Good luck.<br>  Wendi Registered Dental Assistant

Since it doesn't hurt much, it may not be too late and you may only need a teeth cleaning.  You may have an infection on or in your gums, a cavity or you may have something more serious and be in need of a root canal.  Make an appointment with your dentist or an orthodontist and have it checked out.|`|HkacD4yCaa	You should see a dentist. I'm not much of an expert, but your nerve could be damaged.

From personal experience related to full contact sports and from more than ten root canals, they are not as bad as you might expect, especially if the nerve has already died.<br>  <br>  After the root canal, it might be suggested that you have the tooth capped eventually as it may begin to darken with age and time.<br>  <br>  Please get it taken care of as soon as possible.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	You need to see a dentist.

O2s8tLQzaa	Oh dear. It's too long. anyway i had a traditional therapy, if you don't want a surgery which will cost u much money. but this must be consulted with your daughter. You're going to break again slightly day per day the fracture part.<br>  <br>  told her to use balm, and rub and pull-stretch by using the other hand. She must do it by herself. Do this for 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile,<br>  prepare ginger, slice it or smash it. <br>  get a chinese wine for 2 spoon. mix with ginger.<br>  add hot (not boiled) water into them.<br>  <br>  When you had noticed a dark-blue mark, that's where the blood stuck. Stamp that smashed ginger onto the mark for 1 hour. The next hour make another one. If you did this in morning, if the mark becomes reddish-brown and with spreading dot mark, it means it works.<br>  <br>  Do the same for next day, ask her to bend it a bit more, as long as she may take the pain. If you see that blue-dark mark, do same procedure.<br>  <br>  Be patience. My whole left-arm took 3 weeks until I can bend to my back. I was having accident hit by a car, and cannot bend my ankle.<br>  <br>  If it didn't work, I think you should have a rontgen. To check how thick those fracture "chalking" was compounding.<br>  <br>  Don't let it be until a year, or her hand cannot be ... sorry bent anymore.

rpnFxnCQaa	Dr J,<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. <br>  It is <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  The KEY is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety.

Not only did that cure me - you become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution!

I have found that taking very very small steps helps desensitize you and can help you adjust. For example, I would try and take a walk down a busy street even if it was only for a few minutes. I would try and talk to someone in line at the grocery store. Just trying to get out of the house and out of my comfort zone. I know its not as easy as it sounds and I struggle with it every day. Also, you can always see a doctor who can help you through psychotherapy and possibly anti-anxiety meds. (Both have helped me a lot).

Practice this and don't worry what others think, remember that that only opinions you should care about are your loved one's opinions, and stranger's opinions are not important. If you are afraid that someone will judge you or think that you are weird or awkward, just remind yourself that you are you, and everyone is different, and everyone has their imperfections, and this is just your imperfection, and it's going to be okay. Love yourself and don't worry so much about them. Use the term "so what" often; like if they don't like me, so what, if this happens, so what, if you make a mistake, so what.<br>  I hope this helps sweetie, remember that you are not the only one suffering with this, many people are the same, just accept yourself as you are and go on with your life as best you can.<br>  (Hugs)|`|Efe7wstZaa	Hi there...<br>  <br>  Until about a year ago I had a "fear" of people.<br>  Well.. it wasn't really a fear, just thought that whenever I was at a public place, they would all look at me, and kinda laugh and talk about me.<br>  <br>  It sounds silly now that I'm writing ot, but it was really horrible.<br>  There was two things that helped me.<br>  The first was to push myself to go to the border and a little bit further.<br>  <br>  U still remember the first thing I did; I took the bus one stop, and stood up the whole trip.

Also try to realize that anyone judging you so quickly, is likely not someone you want to know anyways. Also you only have one life, why care about what people think of you? In 200 years it will be like you never existed. Also practice small talk. Just say hi. Go out in public, maybe to a restaurant, and start up a conversation, albeit small, with the waiter/waitress.Maybe also try going to a park, simply say hi and smile to all the people you see pass by. Make sure you smile too, it's contagious. Medication might help as well, but I'd try to avoid that route.

With a totally natural diet your bowels should be in excellent working order, but your obviously is not.

It becomes encrusted and, in doing so, it can block the openings in the colon wall and slow the elimination of waste from the body. Eventually this encrustation may cause a gradual ‘putrification’ and toxification of your body.<br>  <br>  Many side effects can result: cardiovascular problems, flu’s, parasites, allergies, cancers, bloating and general abdominal pain are some examples. Another bad consequence of the blockage of the colon’s walls is that bulky foods (e.g. brans, vegetable matter) are too large in size to travel though the diminished holes intended to pass waste through to the rectum for elimination. As a result they build up along the walls and can become a breeding ground for bacteria.<br>  <br>  Some of the symptoms indicative of problems with the functioning of the colon are hemorrhoids, muscle pain, fatigue, stiff joints, bloating, bad breath, a sense of lethargy, loss of appetite and headaches.<br>  <br>  The reported benefits of the colon cleansing process are, most importantly, an improvement in the body’s overall health, as these toxins and waste materials are no longer festering within the body, and valuable nutrients can be more easily absorbed into the body. A significant number of people report that they lose weight. This is due both to the large amount of accumulated fecal matter that is eliminated during the process itself, and the resultant ease with which the body can thereafter absorb nutrients (which reduces hunger pangs).<br>  <br>  Other reported benefits include a healthier skin, a significant reduction in constipation, higher energy levels and less lethargy, and an increase in one’s concentration and memory levels. You may also notice notable reductions in subsequent headaches, hemorrhoids, diarrhea, bad breath, allergies, stress, colds, problems in the digestive system, as well as joint & muscle pains.<br>  <br>  So the benefits of a regular colon cleanse are abundant. Try it once, and see if you enjoy improvements in your health. Then, if you do, you can consider a colon cleansing on a seasonal basis (4 times a year).<br>  <br>  they say it makes you loose weight, and it does :)<br>  hope this helped. look it up on google, u can find it at a drug store/a vitamine store :D|`|jFjz3AQaaa	ok here are some medicines that should give you releif that work like everytime. go to any pharmacy to get them, they are over the counter meaning you do not need a perscription. the first medicine will make you go to the bathroom in about 6-12 hours. its called EXLAX. its little chocolate squares that really work, its a type of laxative. i usually take 4 squares, thats what my doctor told me to take, but thats more than the usual dosage so you should talk to your doctor. i take it at like 8 oclock at night and then usually wake up in the middle of the night like around 3 and have to make so choose your time accordingly. if it doesnt work that could be a serious consdition so see a doctor if this medicine doesnt work. and also note that this is not to be used for a period longer than one week. but definatly try it.

biFCKGAcaa	Yes Both SLS or SLES or Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulpate are one and the same. <br>  <br>  Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) is a detergent widely used in shampoos and other sudsing personal care products. SLES may be irritating to eyes and skin. Otherwise, it is considered for safe.<br>  <br>  SLES can become contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers to be a probable carcinogen. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration encourages manufacturers to strip out this contaminant. <br>  <br>  A somewhat stronger cousin of sodium laureth sulfate is sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). The Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association discourages use of sodium lauryl sulfate in products intended for prolonged use, unless in low concentrations. <br>  <br>  Information has circulated on the Internet and elsewhere that shampoos and other products containing SLS or SLES cause cancer. However, there is no evidence that either ingredient is carcinogenic.<br>  <br>  Since these ingredients can cause skin and eye irration, it is prudent to discontinue use if these symptoms appear. Irritants may permit the penetration of other, more dangerous chemicals.<br>  <br>  The chemical sodium laureth sulfate is ranked as Yellow for Caution. We recommend that you limit exposure.-

Less input will lead to inferior vision.  Its simply a numerical thing.  so its likely your night vision would not be as good as your day vision.<br>  <br>  If you are discussing vision from an infocus standoint.  There may be slight deformation of your lens with extreme dilation of your pupil which allows the lens to properly focuslight and see more "crisp", but this will likely not be a dramatic change.

6d679a9e0bd6b738a49b9830b86d43edaa	There are many types of eating disorders., e.g., compulsive overeating, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, bulimarexia. Compulsive overeating can be aggravated by stress. People with this disease tend to overeat when they're stressed out.<br>  Bulimia and Anorexia Nervosa have been shown to attack certain personality types. The victims tend to be perfectionists. Bulimics often also abuse alcohol or drugs. Anorexics tend to be the quiet, "good kid" in the family, not wanting to draw attention to themselves.  They feel they have no control in any parts of their lives, being the obedient, non-confrontive types. With starvation, this seems to them to be the only thing they have control over -- their own bodies.<br>  <br>  There has been evidence that skinny models in magazines and t.v., movies have an effect on a lot of people. The saying "You can never be too thin or too rich" is prominent now. Kids in the 4th grade are now dieting and have eating disorders! I was once at an eating disorders lecture given by several specialists in this field in which the audience was asked to raise their hands if anyone felt they didn't need to lose at least a few lbs. No one raised their hands. <br>  <br>  Studies show that there is usually a psychological profile or predisposition for severe, chronic cases. There might also be a genetic factor as it tends to run in families, as well as brain chemical factors. If you or someone you know is going through an e.d., you should see your doc right away. The sooner it's treated, the more successful the treatment. These can be life-threatening diseases, or can have lasting physical effects on the body. I've been in and out of hospitals for about 15 years with anorexia and have had a heart attack and vascular disease. I have personally known 2 people who died of it that I met in the hospital, plus one with liver failure and one who had to have a kidney transplant. Anorexia starves every organ in the body. My lowest weight was 56 lbs. in the late 1980's. Now I'm in the 90's and try to keep my weight up. <br>  <br>  One in every 100 teen females are anorexic; 5-10% of anorexics are male; 0.5% of the total population in the U.S. has been diagnosed with Anorexia or Bulimia according to The Better Health Channel.

The effects of Lithium begin within days, but it can take some people a couple months to have the full benefit of the medication. If it is not working as it should, you should talk to your doctor and not leave anything out. It is better to get it regulated fast and to start feeling better, than to wait for it to work to only find out later your body rejected it or is immune to it. Good Luck!|`|8e8a23cbd009fef5b6c5cdec0ddd5349aa	i know it can take about 3 mths or so.  you need to be sure that your not missing any of your doses.  because if you do , it screws up the med levels.but, since its not working at 6 mths, you should really talk to your dr.

66057843940608f21f927b32eeff8f34aa	I work in family planning and have seen horror show after horror show with Depo.  For some folks, their period goes back to normal right away.  For others, particularly if she's been on the shot for a while, it can take...ready for this?...up to a year.  Getting on a dual hormone method (progetin/estrogen...aka the pill, ring, etc.) may help to get your hormones back on track.  Your doctor might even be able to prescribe a little bit of estrogen.

c874b1d8eaaa56613f2d2ab359c1a965aa	Anovulation is a condition that affects between 6% and 15% of all women of childbearing age. It is a disorder of the menstrual cycle, in which a woman does not release an egg for fertilization every month. <br>  <br>  Typically, your body sends specific hormonal signals that trigger ovulation once every month. An egg is released from your ovaries and into your fallopian tubes, where it can be fertilized. Women who are anovulatory though, do not release an egg every month. Instead, they may ovulate intermittently throughout the year, or they may not ovulate at all. Anovulation is especially worrying for some women as it can signal an underlying fertility or reproductive disorder.|`|16b8485b832b45d6aee5b13bb9af7040aa	Anovulation or Amenorrhea<br>  What is it?<br>  <br>  Anovulation means lack of ovulation; amenorrhea means lack of menstruation.<br>  <br>  Both conditions prohibit conception. If you are not ovulating or menstruating, there is always a reason. <br>  <br>  How does it work?<br>  <br>  Ovulation and menstruation require the open, extensive communication between the brain, the pituitary gland, the ovaries, and the uterus. If they are not communicating effectively, there is either a block between the brain and the pituitary gland, the pituitary gland and the ovaries, the ovaries and the uterus, or back to the brain. <br>  <br>  Other reasons for lack of ovulation or menstruation may include not enough body fat to produce adequate estrogen levels to keep this process going. Severe life stressors may also shut this process down. And the harder you try to get it going, the body’s “no” may be stronger than all your combined efforts. One woman at our Fertile Soul Retreats ? stopped ovulating and menstruating every time she visited her mother. Another woman stopped ovulating and menstruating when her in-laws moved next door. And another woman quit ovulating and menstruating for over a year after her husband lost his job. Some women’s reproductive systems are so sensitive that they react to the environment more than our own conscious psyche does.|`|2hH6Wb8maa	In medicine, anovulation is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected (in a post-menarchal, premenopausal woman). Anovulation can result from a variety of factors:<br>  <br>      * Stress, new environment<br>      * Chronic mental illness, such as depression<br>      * Chronic physical illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, poorly controlled diabetes, tuberculosis, or anemia<br>      * Undernutrition, specific nutrient deficiencies, inadequate body fat<br>      * Prolonged or continuous physical exertion<br>      * Various pharmaceutical (especially phenothiazines) and recreational drugs<br>      * Hormone imbalances, such as prolactin or testosterone excess (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome), hyper- or hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency or Cushing's syndrome.<br>      * Pituitary or ovarian failure.<br>  <br>  Some anovulatory women may have two or more contributing conditions. Anovulation can generally be reversed by ameliorating the causal factors (except in cases of permanent pituitary or ovarian failure).<br>  <br>  For most women, alteration of menstrual periods is the principal indication of chronic anovulation. Ovulatory menstrual periods tend to be regular and predictable in terms of cycle length, duration and heaviness of bleeding, and other symptoms. Ovulatory periods are often accompanied by midcycle symptoms such as mittelschmerz or premenstrual symptoms. In contrast, anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding). Mittelschmerz and premenstrual symptoms tend to be absent or reduced when a woman is anovulatory.<br>  <br>  Chronic anovulation is a common cause of infertility.<br>  <br>  In addition to the alteration of menstrual periods and infertility, chronic anovulation can cause or exacerbate other long term problems, such as hyperandrogenism or osteopenia. It plays a central role in the multiple imbalances and dysfunctions of polycystic ovary syndrome.
de34d694442e5c336dd979adfd9bef2baa	You seem to have good analytical skills so I think you should evaluate (or re-evaluate) your situation. Make sure everything is in its place/make sure you have your priorities straight. As in are your loved ones suffering b/c of your stress? (either from your lack of time for them or easily annoyed) If so, it is a big problem for them as well. Anti-depressants can help in these situations but, from experience, it takes a while for them to begin working and that transition period can be extremely difficult. Exercising is a good idea, even though it will take some time away from your day it is worth it b/c not only do you exert physical energy that is built up but you can also clear your mind by focusing on other things. A good idea would be to set an exercise goal like run for x minutes then focus on that and when you suceed you'll feel like you accomplished something (b/c you did!) which helps build your confidence in other areas. Also, you could try delegating small responsibilities to others, even though you would do it better (seriously I'm not being sarcastic!) if it is good enough then it is worth your sanity! Make sure that your bosses aren't expecting the impossible from you. If they are expecting too much you need to think about that b/c it is YOUR life and if you are that devoted to the job I'm sure you can find another one where you would be better suited.

Sounds funny?|`|2c4f3ad4e4204fa32486d5e2a6128760aa	Condoms always have a chance of breaking. But unless the condom is too tight, it is unlikely.  Remember birth control is 99% effective.  So thats saying that your boyfriend is going to have a bad condom, and you birth control is going to fail...  Unlikley?  Id say so.<br>  <br>  If you are so obsessed with not being pregnant dont have sex.  At least dont have sex, until you are ready.  But if you do have sex, i would say you are very safe.|`|4c79d2d014efe53b48034c8e48179708aa	don't worry honey!!

The syndrome is named after Dr. Henry Turner, who was among the first to describe its features in the 1930s. TS occurs in approximately 1 in2,000 live female births and  in as many as 10% of all miscarriages.<br>  <br>  How is Turner syndrome diagnosed?<br>  Diagnosis is made through a test called a karyotype, which is usually performed on cells in the amniotic fluid before birth and on cells in the blood after birth. A trained specialist countsthe chromosomes in the white blood cells and looks for abnormalities. Females normally have two X chromosomes (46,XX) and males have one X and one Y (46,XY). Turner Syndrome individuals are missing all or part of one of their sex chromosomes. About half of girls with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome (45,X). Another third have two X chromosomes, but part of one X is missing. Other individuals with Turner Syndrome have a mosaic pattern: some of their cells are missing an X chromosome (45,X), while other cells have different chromosome composition (such as 46,XX)<br>  <br>  Turner Syndrome may be diagnosed throughout the life span, including adulthood, if signs are subtle. Signs that indicate a karyotype is needed can include:<br>  <br>      * Fetal abnormalities such as cystic hygroma (fluid around the neck), or incidentally when a routine amniocentesis is performed (e.g., for advanced maternal age)<br>      * Webbed neck or  lymphedema (swelling of hands and feet) in newborns<br>      * Specific heart problems in infants<br>      * Slow growth and/or short stature<br>      * Delayed puberty or amenorrhea (lack of menstrual cycles)<br>      * Infertility or menstrual irregularities.<br>  <br>  What are the primary characteristics of Turner syndrome?<br>  Short stature<br>  <br>  The most common feature of Turner syndrome is short stature. The average height of an adult TS woman who has received human growth hormone treatment is 4’8”. Individuals tend to be a little shorter at birth, averaging 18.5” compared to an average of 20” for all girls. Growth failure continues after birth, and most girls with TS fall below the normal female growth curve for height during early childhood. TS girls who are not treated with hormone replacement usually do not have a pubertal growth spurt; many will continue to grow at a slow rate until they are in their twenties. Many girls who undergo growth hormone treatment have been able to achieve adult height within the lower range of normal.<br>  <br>  Premature ovarian failure<br>  <br>  Most (90%) TS individuals will experience early ovarian failure. The ovaries produce eggs and hormones necessary for the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogen replacement therapy is necessary for breast development, feminine body contours, menstruation and proper bone development. About a third of TS individuals will show some signs of breast development without estrogen treatment; however, many will not complete puberty, and those that do often have premature ovarian failure. Therefore, the majority of individuals will require estrogen from puberty until the normal age of menopause. Fertility without assisted reproduction therapy is rare (less than 1%).<br>  <br>  Physical features<br>  <br>  Many characteristic features are associated with Turner syndrome. Their presence and severity vary greatly from individual to individual.<br>  <br>      * Narrow, high-arched palate (roof of the mouth)<br>      * Retrognathia (receding lower jaw)<br>      * Low-set ears<br>      * Low hairline<br>      * Webbed neck<br>      * Slight droop to eyes<br>      * Strabismus (lazy eye)<br>      * Broad chest<br>      * Cubitus valgus (arms that turn out slightly at the elbows)<br>      * Scoliosis (curvature of the spine)<br>      * Flat feet<br>      * Small, narrow fingernails and toenails that turn up<br>      * Short fourth metacarpals (the ends of these bones form the knuckles)<br>      * Edema of hands and feet, especially at birth<br>      * Intelligence - TS individuals are on average of normal overall intelligence with the same variance as the general population.   They do, however, often have difficulty with spatial-temporal processing (imagining objects in relation to each other), nonverbal memory and attention. This may cause problems with math, sense of direction, manual dexterity and social skills. New and better ways to compensate for these problems, which fall under the general category of nonverbal learning disabilities, are being researched. <br>  <br>  What are the associated risks with Turner Syndrome?<br>  Several medical problems occur more frequently in individuals with Turner syndrome than in the general population. It is important that TS individuals are screened regularly to see if any of these problems exist. Most of these conditions can be managed successfully with good medical care.<br>  <br>  Heart<br>  <br>  Some form of cardiac abnormality occurs in approximately one-third of TS patients. Problems are primarily left-sided and may include coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta and bicuspid aortic valve (a valve with two leaflets instead of the usual three). TS individuals are also at higher risk for hypertensionor high blood pressure. TS patients should receive an echocardiogram or MRI to evaluate the heart at the time of diagnosis regardless of age and have their heart re-evaluated periodically for aortic root enlargement. All individuals with TS should be aware of the symptoms of dissection of the aorta, an uncommon but life-threatening complication. These include sudden, severe, sharp, stabbing, tearing, or ripping chest pain, intense anxiety, rapid pulse, profuse sweating, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, fainting or shortness of breath.<br>  <br>  Kidney<br>  <br>  Thirty percent of TS individuals will have kidney abnormalities. Many of the abnormalities do not cause any medical problems; however, some may result in urinary tract infections and an increased risk of hypertension. It is recommended that TS individuals receive a renal ultrasound examination at the time of diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Thyroid<br>  <br>  Hypothyroidism (low level of thyroid hormone) caused by autoimmune thyroiditis (inflammation of thyroid gland) occurs frequently in individuals with TS. It can be diagnosed with a blood test and is easily treated with thyroid hormone.<br>  <br>  Ears<br>  <br>  Otitis media (ear infection) is extremely common in TS girls particularly in infancy and early childhood. Aggressive treatment of infections is appropriate. The majority (50-90%) of TS women will also develop early sensorineural (nerve) hearing loss and may require hearing aids earlier than the general population.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  How can Turner Syndrome be treated?<br>  The treatment of TS individuals should be individualized; physicians, family and patients should decide on treatment options together.<br>  <br>  Growth hormone therapy<br>  <br>  Human growth hormone (hGH) is an FDA-approved drug used to increase the growth rate and achieve greater final height in TS patients. Therapy should be considered when a TS individual experiences growth failure and/or drops below the 5th percentile of the normal female growth curve. The expected increase in height depends upon many factors, including how early GH is started, what dose is given, the duration of treatment, if anabolic steroids (such as oxandrolone) are also given, and how late estrogen therapy is begun. Gains in height between 5 and 16 cm (2 and 6 inches) have recently been reported; however, not every individual responds to growth hormone. Treatment is discontinued when growth is very slow(less than 2 cm or 1 inch per year) or if the patient has reached a satisfactory height.<br>  <br>  Estrogen therapy<br>  <br>  This therapy isnecessary in most TS individuals because of ovarian failure. Therapy is typically begun at 12-14 years of age but should be individualized to optimize both growth and pubertal development. Estrogen is given in small doses to initiate puberty and breast development. The dose is then increased and progesterone is added in order to initiate a monthly menstrual cycle. TS individuals can experience normal sexual function on estrogen therapy. Because of the role estrogen plays in maintaining healthy bone mass, it is generally recommended that the therapy continue untilthe age of normal menopause around 50.<br>  <br>  Becoming a family<br>  <br>  Many options are available to TS women who wish to have children. The most common fertility solution for TS women is adoption. There are now also assisted reproduction technology options for TS women who wish to become pregnant. They include in-vitro fertilization with egg donation by a related or anonymous donor or donor embryo transfer. It is critical that a TS patient undergo a thorough physical evaluation (particularly cardiac and renal) before attempting pregnancy.<br>  <br>  With the help of medical specialists and a good social support system, a woman with Turner syndrome can live a happy, healthy life.<br>  <br>  Posted December, 2005<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  GENETIC OVERVIEW OF TURNER SYNDROME<br>  Turner Syndrome (TS) is a chromosome abnormality affecting about 1 in every 2,000 female births and up to10% of miscarriages.   TS is characterized clinically by short stature, ovarian failure, and a variety of other features such as extra neck skin, heart abnormalities, mild hearing loss, and others.<br>  <br>  Genetically, TS is due to the absence of all or part of onesex chromosome, usually one X.   This abnormality, also called monosomy X, is denoted medically as the 45,X (older literature used XO) karyotype, as opposed to the usual 46,XX female karyotype.   Many, perhaps most, girls and women with TS are actually mosaic, meaning that they have cells with more than one karyotype.   Oftenthere is a mix of 46,XX and 45,X cells, and in this case the resulting clinical abnormalities tend to be milder than in 45,X TS.   Mosaicism, especially 45,X/46,XX, is frequently detected by prenatal diagnosis (amnicentesis).   Occasionally there is mosaicism for cells containing Y chromosome material - but not enough to cause male sexual features.   Girls with TS and Y chromosome mosaicism are at increased risk of developing a tumor of the gonads and should have their nonfunctioning ovaries removed.<br>  <br>  Molecularly, most TS features result from having one rather than two copies of certain X chromosome genes.   To date, one gene called SHOX has been clearly implicated in TS.    Loss of one copy of SHOX is the main cause of short stature in TS.   Identification of TS genes may lead to better treatments for short stature and other symptoms.<br>  <br>  This article was provided by Dr. Andrew Zinn, Chair of the Medical Advisory Board.<br>  <br>  Posted December, 2005<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  GROWTH IN TURNER SYNDROME<br>  <br>  Growth in Turner syndrome (TS) is decreased, and on average the girl with TS will grow to be 8 inches (20 cm) shorter than she would have been. This is because at least one of the genes that influences growth, the SHOX gene, located on the very ends of the short arms of the X chromosomes, is usually missing andaccounts for much of this growth deficit. The growth decrease can be present at birth, with the infant being just bit smaller than average, and proceeds to become more obvious by two to three years and gradually more obvious thereafter. At the time of puberty, whether the girl has some of her own estrogen or takes it as replacement, the growth spurt is much less than average. Each of these phases adds up to the ~ 8 inch difference.<br>  <br>  The growth of girls with TS not treated for their short stature has been studied sufficiently that TS-specific growth curves have been created and are available. Some bones grow even more slowly than others. The lower jaw bone may be quite small and contribute to orthodontic issues. The bones in the hands and wrist may be particularly affected, and some girls have small knuckles (due to short metacarpal bones). A few have bowing of the forearm and deformity of the wrist (Madelung deformity). There may also be changes in the knees which give a knocked-knee appearance, and in rare patients the hip(s) can be dislocated at birth or the top of the hip bone can slip off the long-bone during later years of growth (slipped capital femoral epiphysis). Finally the bones of the spine may grow in a curved fashion resulting in spinal curvature called scoliosis.<br>  <br>  While girls with Turner syndrome do not lack pituitary growth hormone (GH), it has been shown in clinical studies that giving growth hormone can overcome some of the height deficit. The average height gain is about 4 inches (10 cm) or half of the deficit, with early institution of GH associated with greater growth and taller final height. GH is given by injection, and usually started in the preschool or early school years (unless diagnosis is delayed) since catch-up growth takes time. Once started, treatment usually continues so that growth can continue faster than if not treated, and isn’t stopped until final heightis reached (growing end of bones fuse, called “fused epiphyses”) or the girl and her family are satisfied with height reached. The majority of TS girls will also need estrogen therapy, and its timing is somewhat related to how much growth deficit is remaining at the time feminization is desirable. Estrogen contributes much less to a growth spurt in girls with TS than it does in girls without TS. On the other hand, it is the hormone that is responsible for the bones fusing. Thus, pediatric endocrinologists, who generally supervise growth hormone treatment, balance the need for feminization with the inches that can still be achieved before the bones fuse. The earlier growth hormone is started, and the taller the girl is, the earlier in adolescence that estrogen can be started without a negative effect on final height.<br>  <br>  This article was contributed by Dr. Barbara Lippe, Member of the TSSUS Board of Directors.<br>  <br>  Posted December, 2005<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  FERTILITY/ENDOCRINE ISSUES IN TURNER SYNDROME (TS)<br>  <br>  Most women with TS have ovarian failure.   In other words, they do not have ovaries capable of producing female hormones and eggs.   They need hormonal treatment in order to undergo pubertal development and to have menstrual periods.   Their reproductive organs are otherwise normal.   They are able to have normal sexual relations.   Generally, the only way to overcome infertility in TS is adoption or egg donation (embryo donation is also possible).   In most women with TS the uterus responds well to hormonal preparation and it is capable of carrying a pregnancy normally.   Before contemplating pregnancy, women with TS need to undergo a complete medical evaluation, with particular attention to the cardiovascular and renal systems.   Pregnancy in women with TSshould be followed by a high-risk obstetrician.<br>  <br>  This article was contributed by Dr. Luis Rodriguez, Member of the Medical Advisory Board.<br>  <br>  Posted December, 2005<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  EAR AND HEARING DISORDERS IN TURNER SYNDROME<br>  <br>  There are two common forms of hearing loss in Turner Syndrome.   The first is conductive hearing loss caused by fluid behind the eardrum, which mostly affects  younger girls with Turner Syndrome.   This conductive loss is only a partial loss, but can still significantly affect hearing and communication.   Consultation with an ear-nose-throat specialist is iimportant if the fluid persists or becomes infected frequently.   There are a variety of options available to treatthis problem, including antibiotics and the placement of a tympanostomy tube in the eardrum.   The conductive hearing loss generally will completely resolve if and when the fluid disappears.<br>  <br>  The second type of hearing loss is sensorineural, caused by a primary problem in the inner ear (cochlea).   This type of hearing loss is permanent, and often slowly progresses over years and decades.   A few Turner Syndrome individuals have a partial sensorineural hearing loss as children.   In contract, many Turner Syndrome women develop a partial sensorineural hearing loss primarily affecting the high pitches (frequencies) as adults.   In most cases, hearing aids are an adequate method to rehabilitate sensorineural hearing loss since it does not typically progress to total or profound hearing loss.<br>  <br>  This article was provided by Dr. Andrew Griffith, Member of the Medical Advisory Board.<br>  <br>  Posted December, 2005

15193d882a57743a623406d40ff0b8dcaa	Lord Yes!!! I get them all the time. And sometimes whe u go pee.....u feel like u have to go bad.....and u go....but u barely pee.....it seems like a UTI that u let get too far....but its ok....cuz u didnt know what it was. Now member....once u get a UTI once....its very easy to keep gettin them. When u go t the doctor hes probably gonna make u pee in a cup.....to test ur acidic levels in ur urine....its nothing to worry about...hes just makin sure u have a UTI....then u will prolly be prescribed an antibotic. <br>  <br>  Some reasons for UTI's:<br>  *Multiple Sex Partners/Sex and not washing good enough.(Also always urinate before and after sex.)<br>  *TOO MUCH CAFFEINE...(This is what causes 99.9% of mine.) Drink water and cranberry juice. No caffeine or juices high in acid.<br>  *Also,believe it or not....holding ur urine too long and not goin right away when u need to can cause these too. It causes ur urine (which is high in acid) to sit in ur bladder too long. Which will cause a UTI.<br>  <br>  If more info. is needed let me know. Good luck.|`|49b792d6ba807b8fcf96273ea8d7f055aa	Yes, it sounds like a possible UTI -- sx's are pain upon urination, having to pee often, and sometimes there's some blood in the urine.    If you have nausea and/or vomiting (and fever and back pain), it could mean a kidney infection rather than just the ordinary bladder infection (UTI) -- and that would need to be dealt with very quickly.<br>  <br>  I'd call your doc's office and be really persistent about getting him/her on the phone -- say it's an emergency...and usually docs have coverage even when they're not in.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, drink plenty of water, and real cranberry juice may be helpful.  In the pharmacy, you'll find something called Urostat that could be helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|78c5d070a980893eed6125202ad09a54aa	Yes, that definitely sounds like a UTI.  If your doctor is unavailable, how about an urgent care facility.  These facilities are perfect for your situation.  It will only get worse, so don't wait to go!<br>  <br>  They will prescribe some anti-biotics that will kick the infection quickly.|`|8718f7f58eedaaf7fa4f72fc3c487fa6aa	I get UTI's all the time and these are my symptoms as well. There is an over -the -counter test you can get at the drug store. They are called AZO test strips and are very accurate. You will find them with the tampons, ky jelly and such. You get a cup with 3 test strips for about $10.  If it is positive you will have to go to the doctor to get a prescription. I prefer Levaquin or Macrobid. You will start to feel better about 1 day after starting the medicine. Good luck.|`|AA12316174	Sounds like an UTI. Drink plenty of water and purchase some cranberry pills and taken them instead of the cranberry juice. The juice contains sugars which lil bacteria LOVES and multiplies with. They also sell some pills over the counter that make your pee orange BUT it eases the burning ALOT (uristat) use that in the m ean time until you can see your DR. dont wait to long bc the infection can travel into your kidneys.<br>  <br>  Im very prone to UTI's so I reccomend (if your prone too)<br>  Urinating after sex<br>  drinking plenty of water<br>  taking cranberry pills on a daily basis<br>  wiping front to back ALL the time|`|cb7cdde937cac7e0b7edbeb4bba46834aa	Yes. Sounds like a UTI.  See a doctor asap.  It gets really painful if you let it go for too long...and a simple course of anti-biotics should make you feel better in a short period of time. If you start peeing blood..go to the ER.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of fluid in the meantime but avoide acidic juices...even cranberry juice ( too late for its protective qualities to help you now..since the infection has already taken place) since it will not help with the burning.
AA11229176	All good answers above, but in addition to theirs, the fever makes me suspect an inflammation or infection - have they tested you for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease?  It has signs and symptoms like those which you mention.  As for what else it could be, the answers above hit all the important points.  Good luck to you.|`|37c1a9d0c658d42150fd75ead241de49aa	Hi! Could it be a fibroid? It sounded similar to what I used to have but it has already a thing of the past. Well, the only thing you could do right now is to wait for the diagnosis because it is never accurate guessing. Just wait patiently for the result to come out and then see what advice your doctor will give to you. Always seek a second or even third opinion if surgery is recommended by your doctor because it's always best to seek other opinions. Replying on just one doctor's view is dangerous because he may not be right! So just got to be very carefula nd don't rush into anything....especially if you are not sure of what you'll be in for and when you are confused and not ready. Continue to take good care of your health whiel awaiting the scan result. Hopefully it's nothing serious. Don't stress yourself too much. Be at ease...at least until the result comes. Take care!|`|4616bcc2ec7752250314547e6b452984aa	Ok.. now I can't tell you exactly whats wrong unless you specify your age, whether the bleeding is heavy only during your period or if it is persistent, how long your last period was and when, how regular your periods are, since when have you been getting the fever and other symptoms, and how long/heavy your regular periods were before this. <br>  Anyway - if you are above 30yrs of age, considering you have said there is 'something stuck to the wall of your endometrium' and they want to take 'ultrasounds CTscan and biosys', I would coclude that you have one of the following:<br>  a)Fibroids - a benign mass in the uterus. Very common, and mostly asymptomatic, then you dont have to worry. If it starts troubling you however, like bleeding etc, then you may have to remove it. If there are multiple fibroids, a hysterectomy may be needed - an operation where your uterus is removed.<br>  b)Endometrial cancer - the biopsy will confirm it, and your doc will give you appropriate treatment.|`|c4fa4dec07d0f62a176073c4f4c93afdaa	It sounds like they found a lesion in your endometrial cavity.  This is different than just finding a lesion in your uterus which is likely a fibroid.  My guess is that they want to do a hysterscope or biopsy which is reasonable in light of your symptoms.  They won't know what it is until they do that.  It can be a polyp, blood clot, sub mucosa fibroid or cancer.  Likely the CT can wait until they have the biopsy result.  Do not be afraid to ask your doctor again.  Write down your questions.  Have faith in your military doctors and good luck!

sB9xp8wraa	Yes, it is safe to drink Slimfast after it's been frozen. I used to pour them into a different container, freeze them and then eat them like a popcicle.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to take the frozen ones out of the fridge, let them thaw, then adjust the temp in the fridge so it's a bit warmer, and put them back in, making sure that they are as far away as possible from the freezer part.|`|ep3dqXrpaa	Gotta love convenience!  I am sure it is safe to drink while frozen.  but may I suggest instead of living on these, you try whole foods instead?  Read the ingredients of these shakes.  Maybe that batch wasn't distributed evenly and it has more of one ingredient than another.  If you call Slim Fast, they can give best answers.  Yes, these are easy and convenient... but everybody needs real fiber, soluble fiber.  I learned the hard way.  About 14 years ago, I was doing the slimfast diet and was treated at the hospital for not being able to pass... you know solids...  It is gross conversation but soluble fibers like brown rice, oats, whole grains... quinoa is another, fibers that absorb water on the way down to make things soft and roll gently through you are powerful and very good for you.  Good luck!
960c6115c5745a5e4a5a847e3e4ec309aa	It sounds like a bunion.|`|9536c55f02d31e54c5e684ba61fd9bc6aa	i'd probobly try one of those "dr. scholls freeze thingy" i forgot what it's called.... it sounds kinda like a mix of a pimple and a blister. i would probobly leave it for a few days and see what happens.
xzwZ3lt3aa	They are more common in women who have had multiple births or babies weighing more than 9 pounds.|`|9yP43Peiaa	Quite common in women who have had kids. Full prolapses usually happen after a woman has had more than 3. Minor prolapse dont usually need surgery but major ones e.g you innards are literally hanging out then you will need it pushed back up. Do not have a hysterectomy  unless you really have to.|`|q4tTabfjaa	That happened to my mother, she was on duty in the hospital and tried to finish her shift "idiot" (sorry mummy), but as for the stats for the frequency, I have no idea.
e304ed61586e0efc7e0dcf58e85b142aaa	No offence, but if you don't want to go out with him then why do you need to know if he likes you or not? <br>  He might like you, or he might just consider you a friend. You also could be reading too much into this.<br>  Going by what you have said, I would say he may have had some feelings, but they soon subsided and no longer feels that way, or he is too shy and embarrassed about liking an older girl.<br>  You could also try asking him, or getting a friend to ask him.<br>  Good Luck :)|`|960c6115c5745a5e4a5a847e3e4ec309aa	It sounds like he likes you but 14 is very young in a guy. I can remember being 16 and so serious about guys, now that I have 2 teenage boys I realize how immature they really are. You already heard him say he doesn't want to date. Take the clue and forget about having a relationship with him.
mAp90hEeaa	You can try to treat this yourself.  Wash the area with soap and water daily which is the best anti-bacterial you can use. Pat the area dry then, put some bacitracin or neosporin ointment over the blister/scab area and put a bandaid over it.  This should help clear it up in about a week.  Common sense should tell you that if it gets worse and worse, the redness  or swelling increases and there is a lot of white pus seeping from the wound, then it is time to see your doctor.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I hardly think a lesion on one's foot has anything to do with an STD.<br>  <br>  It is uncommon for a lesion to become infected after forming a scab. <br>  If you are distressed, see a physician.
293fbb199a9d1cabdcbe7138e3e2de00aa	I agree with 'whosyourmama'!  I am naturally well endowed and wish i wasnt.   bras last 6 months TOPS and are very expensive, forget about buying a cute color or anything at Victorias Secret...i dont fit into any of their stuff!  I could shop for a new car in less time than it takes to buy a bra.  Think about it long and hard!  Big breasts are cumbersome!|`|180d609426efbd3281e057f0cc3fcde4aa	I don't & people think I have them. I would like to get rid of my breasts!

fc933328ee9740346801c991325ba391aa	Wear open sandals|`|dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa	If the fungus is the main problem then open shoes should work. But as to your second part of your question, I think it's just silly that people don't care about seeing 99% of the foot exposed in a flipflop and start screaming 'gross' when the foot is totally bare. It's not dangerous and feet do not need support; support can even lead to problems. I've seen the results of a large survey in India; the men who pulled the old riksja's barefoot had very, very little foot problems even though they ran barefoot on paved roads that definitely weren't clean either. They had far less foot problems than us Westeners who put our feet in all these fashionable shoes with all our different supportive sports shoes for every different type of sport you could think of... Most Americans are brainwashed by the signs on store windows claiming it's unhealthy and/or dangerous enough to even be against the law (which isn't true btw, as the asker already noted), but in Europe most people think barefooting is healthy, even if they give in to fashion and rarely do it themselves.|`|2450ec9e6d3869ead0de9bf051683455aa	there are shoes made for people that have that problem.. shoes like sneakers that breath.|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	Personally I dont give a monkeys about seeing bare feet, its no big deal.  If it was the norm, no one would take any notice of it!;|`|c3023fd6250ccce24970be2b869e2b61aa	Just wear flip-flops or open sandals. That fixes your problem. I wear them most of the time anyway seeing as I'm in Florida. I'm not offended by what people wear because it's their feet, not mine.|`|ea18aea4670c76170083fc87b41e07eeaa	I really don't pay attention to feet.  Just wear sandals and tell anyone that gives a dirty look to shuck it.<br>  <br>  I actually get calluses from going barefoot, not from wearing shoes.|`|1e8cbe82d91ee05f366272ff845b398eaa	Wear something like a Birkenstock sandal (that had straps across, but not between the toes) with a light cotton sock. It's better for you to wear something with an arch support and padding than to go barefoot - that will just cause futher probablems down the road.
dfd23710f23fc0740f64f481ba35ba0caa	You can't "help" them until they want to help themselves.  You also can't enable them to continue their ways either.  It's a sickness.  Once the brain needs alcohol, it's a mental issue as well.   You should never give up on them, but sometimes you need to step back and let them hit their "BOTTOM".   Get into a local group to help you learn what you need to do to help your friend.  Its the only way.  They are in the same boat as you and can help you tremondously.   Call your local Alanon and ask questions and get to some meetings.|`|3e54ef59d2f31682466ffcbed9d9b307aa	They have to want to change themselves. Watch Intervention on A&E on sunday night. It will give you an inside look at the lifestyle of an addict.|`|AA11455037	You cannot save an alcoholic unless they want to be saved.They go to treatment centers and they say they want help,but if they don,t help themselves they cannot be helped..Most of them just revert back to their old ways....I have a son like this and i help him and all the family members have helped him,but i have come to know that you cannot help them,its something they have to do for themselves ,and if you can stand to be around them you can be of support IF they ever change.|`|e8fd7ba0a211e3daa0270adf380beaf3aa	you cant help or save someone who doesnt want to be helped or saved.  all you can do is be there when they reach their bottom.   when they are ready to change they will need your support and understanding.  its very difficult to make those needed changes. you can contact alcoholics anonymous organizations nearby for more information and help for you to deal with it.|`|AA11461648	They have to want to change. My father was in the hospital for months, got a little heathier and is right back at it. He will probably die soon, he is in a auwful shape and he says he will drink intill he dies.|`|c3023fd6250ccce24970be2b869e2b61aa	You cannot make someone do something they don't want to do. They know it's bad for them, but why stop? If your friend won't change after 5 months of treatment they never will!
K2QwEM4raa	Yes and you need to find another medication if you need one.|`|IKakoOfyaa	Yes, hydrocodone can cause irritability.|`|RJeucPf9aa	Different drugs have different affects on different people. It has to do with attitude and anger management as well. And if one feels like the drug is affecting them with bad side effects then one should stop taking that particular medication and consult an physician for similar prescription, except without the side effects.|`|upwwspFIaa	Opiates can cause extreme irritability. It throws your body off in many ways and you should Limit  your use to as little as possible. These drugs are ancient and its a shame you had to go through that.

etIBdVE3aa	Fruits are the most deceiving SUGAR LOADED foods.<br>  <br>  Oranges do have vitamin C but are loaded with sugar.

Just keep track of the calories 1500 is enough if you want to lose along with moderate exercise 3-5 days a week. You should lose 2 pounds a week if you're consistent and follow your program.|`|AA11251285	When you eat fruit, don't mix it with anything else or else you increase the chances of fermentation and gas.<br>  Give fruit at least 3 hours to digest before you eat anything else.<br>  <br>  Even though fruit has natural sugar, if you eat tons of it, the high level of sugar will create some imbalances in your system. For some folks, too much sugar can make them nervous & anxious.<br>  Better to eat a nice variety of beans, grains, fruits, organic chicken & fish, and PLENTY of vegetables.|`|0a3365e60ed6ac719c848e7eee088ff9aa	Too much fruit will cause diarrhea|`|BSqDYs1eaa	yes fruit is good for you eat it constantly|`|tIldpr7vaa	lots of sugar, limit fruit on a diet|`|AA11447210	Your body needs a mix of things to stay healthy.

2b91b2f601549e336eac348084421a74aa	If you want huge bodybuilder abs you should work out with resistance ( weight ). If you just want to show off your abs you just really need to diet. If your situps get too easy for you, you should probably try holding a weight while doing your situps. You usually see abs when your around 10% bodyfat, so you should probably get that checked. You can see abs on anyone under 10% bodyfat, if you cant see them now you're probably over and need to lose some weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck man|`|637edd7a66d3685cf2360e8d63f9de53aa	It is not necessarily how many sit ups you are doing, that must be combined with a good diet, proper rest, and cardiovascular activity such as jogging or aerobics to get the maximum results you are looking for.  It also depends on how much bodyfat content that you have until you reach the point in which the layer of fat sheds away for them to be visible.|`|AA12151545	You never will. You have to do cardio and eat right to get rid of the layer of fat over your abs first. If you keep doing sit ups your abs will get bigger but will make you look bigger then u are right now cause it will push the layer of fat out further|`|c2599112523e045f6357477f5917f35eaa	This depends on what results you are looking for.  If you are just looking for more toned abs, then it takes about 4 weeks for a noticeable strength increase to occur.  You have to keep in mind that often people are not performing sit ups correctly.  I recommend getting a swiss ball, and putting under your low back and then doing the situps.  There is no way to cheat then!  Look at the size chart on the ball box to determine the correct size ball for you.|`|AA10117437	Yeah, you cannot spot reduce.  Of course, if you're skinny already you may see some results in a month or so.

AA10103815	You most definately do not deserve to die. Something to remember right away about these help lines is that they are run by everyday people. And as you have probably found out by this point in your life, random everyday people are often rude, unintelligent, uncaring, and unqualified for the job they have.<br>  <br>  What happened sounds like a very bad day indeed, but it's not your fault. Even not being able to sleep may be related to a simple chemical imbalance in your brain. These things are most definately not uncommon, and it doesn't mean that you're weird, or crazy, or anything like that. It just means that your brain chemicals were working slightly differently, and maybe just due to a bad night of sleep!<br>  <br>  Also important is that your teacher was most certainly not joking like that with a student. A teacher goes through years of college to get a job like the one they have and would lose it instantly if there was any solid evidence of this happening. From someone who has known teachers, take it from me, they will not risk their job over this. Your classmates were probably just teasing, and being insensitive, as they often are.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how schools in Canada work, but here in the states, each school has a guidence counsellor of some sort. I would suggest making an appointment to see him/her confidentially. They cannot say anything at all, and will go over a big confidentiality clause with you. They are there only to help, and if you called a hotline, you are definately strong enough to be willing to accept the help.<br>  <br>  Just remember, what's going on isn't your fault, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't live, and that by going through this and coming out the other side of it alive, you'll be stronger than you'd ever thought possible.

I remember once when I called them they had a new guy on the phone councelling me but he had to keep putting me on hold, and in essence told me what your guy told you, like "you'll be fine" and that was it.<br>  <br>  I got over that, and moved on with my life.  That was a looonnng time ago.  I want you to trust me that you will definiatly get through what you are going thru now.  I know it is hard, but you know what?  I can see your strength in yourself just by what you wrote.  <br>  <br>  It is hard to fit in, and having people talk about you is hellish.  I know 'cause I've been there.<br>  <br>  It sounds so cliche, but is there anyone you can talk to?  How much do your parents know?  I'll give you the standard, "talk to your parents" "talk to your guidance councelor" "talk to your priest".  But, please feel free to email me and I would be happy to talk with you.<br>  <br>  If nothing else, at least you know you have friends here on this site!!!  Right?!  <br>  <br>  I look forward to hearing from you!|`|12d253153b44893230dd29ff7edb3e41aa	KIDS CAN B SO CRUEL IVE BEEN THROUGH THAT RIGHT NOW I'M GOING THROUGH EVEN MORE PROBLEMS FEELING THE SAME WAY ABOUT LIFE.

You're facing what you're facing now because you choose to. You can choose to either go back to school and face all the horrible things courageously and take an active stance to change your life, or u can continue wallowing in self-pity. Another alternative will be to change your school, change your environment. However, what good will that do? If the problem lies with you then no matter where you go, the problem will always exist. Change your life. Change yourself and you'll realise that everything around you gradually changes too. Instead of wasting time comtemplating death, why don't you spend time actively seeking for ways to change yourself and your environment? <br>  <br>  Maybe it's difficult to do that now. Try to get a good rest and sleep, like what the helpline said. With a fresh mind and body, you'll have the better energy to face whatever life challenges you. Good Luck!|`|d6c42d16b933c505c0c5f99e0eaafd6daa	No, you don't deserve to die. Listen, people do care about you. I don't know you from Adam but I felt compelled to write you. I know how you feel because I've been there myself and I know there is a light at the end of this dark tunnel. You might not have gotten around the bend in the track yet, and maybe that's why you don't see it, but it's there. Don't give up. Life always has a way of evening itself out and you will always have a friend when you need one. Your priceless and don't ever let anyone tell you differently. School's tough and can hurt so very much, but death hurts way more, and your death would hurt everyone that has and will respond. Remember we care about you and find you very worthy of life and all of the good that's in it.|`|dfe19ef453411f8914041b0429750417aa	Thats a very bad help line.Don't give up on yourself school is so tough and i know that the teaseing hurts i'v been there except it was teaseing about other things.....Teachers are A's all of them have problems and the realese on you if you dont that with your boy friend  then you have nothing to be worried about and if you do Why the heck should they care it's your life!You need to live I know its hard and i know the feeeling of wanting to die but it's not right that your gonna give up like you should never ever give up your life because some loser dosent have a lifeeand has to make something up with you.So go out there and be the best you can be then when you make it big time go visit them and rub in thier faces.
AA10117437	Similar thing happened to me.  My doctor ordered carotid dopplar to rule out TIA (mini-stroke) which was negative.  I was eventually diagnosed with an optic migraine.  I could not think of simple words, I could not describe to someone how to get out of the house, down the street, etc.  I felt like I was not even in my own body.  My face and arm was numb.

b725bd4233753125a0b5b65e6af14e29aa	try doing some light cardio for a few weeks..and do it more often later on.  I would suggest doing that first and then changing your diet.|`|AA11127135	First of all, you have to set aside some time to work out each day. Current recommendations say you should do 30 minutes of cardio on most days of the week as well as eating a well-balanced diet. THIS DOES NOT MEAN CUTTING CARBS. Your body requires carbohydrates for energy as well as for normal brain functioning. If you want to lose weight, it is suggested that you cut 500 calories from your diet each day to safely lose 1-2 pounds per week. Keep your fat intake low and try to replace it with more nutrient dense foods like fruits, vegetables, and low-fat carbs. Keep in mind that exercise and proper diet must be used in combination to maximize your results. <br>  <br>  Keep trying different exercises so your workouts stay fresh. This will also force your body to keep recruiting different muscles. Best of luck. . . .|`|1f3e7416c6712a43bef0c5ce096c5890aa	go on the south beach diet<br>  it works great|`|6aa05e9da1f6d563aeba2c801c93b80aaa	eat less crap food . and run outside 30 mins 4-5 times a week and then there will be a radical change|`|7aa3fcaf01aee42cd959c34b88e99da0aa	relax u still got a while and im sure ur perfectly ok the way u r but if u wanna lose weight try runnin a certain time every day and if u want quicker results do sit ups do not change ur diet unless ur gonna keep it that 4ever cuz after ur at ur target weight and u resume a bad diet all ur weight that u got rid of will b bak so either change it 4ever or work out harder...but ur fine|`|AA10174618	The Master Cleanse has been known to help people lose alot of weight, Beyonce has used it!|`|AA10117127	THE MASTER CLEANSE.  I just completed my second master cleanse diet.  It requires huge discipline because you're required to consume ONLY home made lemonade.  The recipe consists of only 4 ingredients:  Spring water, lemon juice, original maple syrup and cayenne pepper.<br>  <br>  If you do a Yahoo search for "master cleanse" you'll find the ingredients in the right proportions.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I just completed the diet for the second time, both for 5 days plus.  You not only lose a large amount of weight, those particular ingredients mean that 1) you don't feel hungry and 2) your body cleanses itself of all the toxins that build up over time.<br>  <br>  Sure, it's not easy during the diet, but believe it or not, your eating habits change afterwards.  You don't want to consume the same amounts of food, and somehow your body also tells you to avoid foods that are rich in fats and sugars.<br>  <br>  I am a 34 year old guy.  I started at 212 lbs and ended up at 194.  I look and feel a lot better.<br>  <br>  Like I said, it requires a great deal of discipline, but if you're determined and strong in mind, it has amazing results.

ce355a83968a26225bfdad5c1cc5612eaa	Is there any way you can have part of a tissue left there from your cold?  I know it sounds gross but you would be surprised.  My best guess is either a foreign object or an abscess of some sort.  You really need the see an ear, nose and throat doctor.  They need to look in your nose to find out where the smell is coming from.  I once took care of a child in ER that had this green stuff coming our his nose, on exam to the mothers horror, we found a dried bean that had sprouted and was growing out his nose!!!|`|4f46b98461799d35fb376e698a8c3b43aa	Sounds like a stubborn sinus infection.

You may have some other rare condition.  ENT's deal with this stuff every day.|`|ef77676a3d6563075944a4ed484fccc0aa	I don't know what the smell is or why it's there.<br>  I do suggest you try nasal irrigation though, by using a neti pot.<br>  <br>  A friend suggested I try it because I have sinus problems all the time. It's safe and natural way to maintain healthy sinuses.|`|960c6115c5745a5e4a5a847e3e4ec309aa	You need to see a specialist, ask your doctor for a referal. You could have a foreign object stuck in your nostril (sinus cavity). That strange smell shouldn't be ignored.

LqvX5whyaa	Heya,<br>  This does sound to me like shes started her periods by your description, what i would advise you both is to have a word with your mom or a close female relative they will be able to take her to the store ( even you could do this big sister) and help her pick out some sanitary wear also you could look for some sanitary wipes that will help keep her fresh during her period which it does sound like shes got it. Also if shes having this on keep a pad on to cause its likely to get heavier but if it dont dont worry its normal.<br>  Also get some really nice deodrant that will help keep you feeling fresh to, but i promise all this is nothing to be worried about and if your sister wants to talk about anything she can email me and i will reply back thats no problems at all. So basically it looks like she has, get down the store and pick out some nice sanitary wear, also some femine wipes - also you could pop by the shop and get some chocolate :P but please tell a close female relative or your mom she can really help her out and put her mind to rest on this issue.<br>  ( Also it would be handy to carry a bag to school such as a pencil case with some spare pads in some deodrant and maybe even some femine wipes so if it comes by suprise anytime she is prepared!)<br>  Hope i helped and if your sister needs to talk im here.<br>  Take care<br>  x|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	It's likely if she's already developing at that age, girls are getting it younger and younger. Also, when I started it was more disharge-ish and the color you described instead of plain red, which is what a lot of people expect. You (or her) should ask an adult close to you and tell her not to be embarrassed as it is a natural thing.|`|2v60zG5Faa	well if theres some on her pants then yes xx she has started puberty so if she hasn't  then it proberly won't be long tell her to keep a pad and some wipes n girl thing in a little vanity case in her bag just incase xx<br>  tell ehr to look at this website<br>  <a href="http://www.bodyform.co.uk/Default.aspx?id=1874" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyform.co.uk/Default.aspx?i...</a><br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/</a><br>  n if theres nothing in her pants apart form dicharge then no she hasn't started xx|`|ePZN6RG3aa	Well this does indicate that she was ready to ''come'' on her period, but ny blood or spotting means a period or the periods just started. So the answer is; she's most likely started her period, leave it for another half hour and she will tell, her period will get heavier. <br>  Make sure that she got her pads and everything ready, set her out with a little ''period bag'' To put in her bag for school, just a plain makeup bag but have clean under-ware, 2-3 pads, or tampons.|`|ViR6BXiyaa	Well it certainly sounds as though her body is ready for a period.

It's not always bright red blood at first.  She can wear a pantyliner at first while it's really light, but will probably need to get either pads or tampons pretty soon.  Is there someone in your family that she can talk to about all of it?

One of these factors may be the area of focus in order to cure migraine.  Ibuprofen upsets the stomach and would aggravate the migraine in due course unless abundant milk is taken, which normally people are averse to.  <br>  <br>      If the cause is traced to back of neck, in homeopathy Cocculus indicus 30 three doses a day for two three days will lead you to cure. a dose of Rhus Tox 1M in the beginning will be helpful.  If the pain is due to salt imbalances where the rise and setting of sun would be linked, Natrum Mur 30 will help you. For all periodical headaches and migraine, Chionanthus Q three times a day  5 to 10 drops in one ounce of water for as long as required as a liver tonic would curtail and break the habit.  Arsenic Album will help here as complementary medicine.  If the headache is left sided and has connection with blood circulation and heart, Spigelia 30 will help (the neurological type of headaches).  If the headache is right sided and has rheumatic pains associated with it on the right side, Sanguinaria 30 to 1M would be of help.  In many cases of headaches, Nux Vomica and Sulphur would be helpful in 30 potencies.  To relieve constipation Alumina will be helpful in 30 potency.  In females Pulsatilla will help in many cases related with menstrual cycles.

CuVnpxh3aa	Let me tell you about long term problems with starving yourself. I have a digestive disease called Gastroparesis. I can't eat food, no fruits, vegetables, meats, nothing but strained baby fruit. I lost 70 pounds in 4 1/2 months. I have not been able to smell a thing for 16 months and counting, the Dr said I may never get my smell back. All my vitamins, electrolytes & minerals are depleted. I have to go to the hospital every 2 months to get IV's of vitamins, minerals & electrolytes that I am unable to get from food. My body has pulled all the calcium from my bones and it hurts my feet to try to stan up and walk, I am very close to having osteoporosis. My body also pulled all the protein from my body, I have no strength, I can't even open a soda (pop) bottle, I can't twist the lid off of it because I have no strength. There is no cure for what I have and the Docs say it is the worst case they have ever seen so no one will see me now (no Dr) because they can't help me. Sometimes when they are trying to put the IV's in they have to stick me 6-8 times before they can get a vein and we just hope it won't blow so I can get the IV. I have idiopathic gastroparesis, the hardest to treat because it does not have the normal symptoms.  I know you don't want to hear what can happen if you don't eat but it is very important that you do. You have no idea what you are doing to your body. I would give anything to be able to eat a meal, or a burger, or a piece of pizza but I have to eat STRAINED baby fruit. My grandson is 4 months old, his Dr just put him on strained baby fruit, I have been on it for several years. I've had this since late 2000. Don't end up like me, think about what you are doing. If you want to lose weight, cut back on your food and exercise but don't starve yourself, very bad idea. Don't end up like me, I can't be fixed. My next step is a tube into my intestines and a nutrition bag of liquids to keep me alive. Not looking forward to that!!!|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Ok, I won't tell you that you can die, and that your poor family will have to watch you suffer because secretly, you just want people to give you attention for being a stick insect.<br>  <br>  I eat what I like when I like personally.

08Vk3RtJaa	if this has been going on for 2-3 months I really think you should see a doctor as it doesn't sound like this is going to heal up by itself.  If the scabs are constantly getting wet and soft (and possibly getting knocked off when you dry yourself) they won't get much of a chance to heal.  You could try having showers and wearing a shower cap, unless you have to wash your hair, and make sure you dry behind your ears properly, that might help, but really my advice would be to see your doctor because if you have had open sores for that long they could have become infected.|`|pDd5jRxEaa	Go see a doctor!!

The teenage years are a rough period for most of us because we're struggling with multiple issues and don't always have a good way to express how we think or feel.  Several of the key things that are going on in this stage are working out automonmy/independence issues with parents, struggling to form an individual identity while still trying to conform to our social/peer group, learning to balance academic/work demands with our need/desire to have fun and relax, etc.  With all of that, and usually lots more going on, it's actually pretty normal to have periods of depression, anxiety, irritability or general moodiness.|`|5318f791549e934001b7b1ec6b9cb920aa	because we suck.|`|AA10169684	it is a  phase of transition from boyhood to adulthood. it is a period of adoloscence.  <br>  if every adoloscent practises acupressure on his/her own body, the hormonal imbalances shall be corrected and all the problems   cited, can be overcome.|`|AA11722351	Their horomones are changing, they are very confused and not sure what to feel.

That is an old concept. it is an addiction, and people who regularly smoke and inhale are nicotine addicts or basically drug addicts. I smoked for 15 years and quit. I still slightly miss it today, thats how powerful it is, dont underestimate it. When you feel the craving, do some form of exercise and drink cold qualty water and wash away the desire. you will be edgy but that tkes time to wear off. Accumulate days and make it fun.

Another may be that when you fell the need for a smoke, have an apple or a piece of gum. But don"t over eat to much or you will gain weight.

You can take the two together and should see good results.  Creatine is considered safe otherwise steak and meats would not be safe because they contain creatine.  Taking the two together should enhance the absorption of the creatine because if taken by itself, your body absorbs roughly 30%.  You will not blow up either.  This is seen only when creatine is taken with excess carbohydrates.|`|727f6be137b79e3d3a9bdd34236eba95aa	yes just watch your creatine because without enough exercise you willjust blow up and be fat. also you can lose muscle mass when you stop taking if you dont keep up your workouts.

I too am on antidepressants and feel tired  a lot from stinking arthritis, but since I have started helping other people, I have felt better...also, you need to treat yourself once in a while, be good to yourself,,you are a unique and wonderful creation...remember to continue to reach out as you have done here,,I pray good things for you.............|`|fb20934d133cae7afdd6f7a9938a1cdbaa	I would try paying attention to your diet. Eating healthier foods can help boost your energy level along with exercise, which you already do.  I don't know if you have ever tried any meditation or guided meditation but I think it helps to clear your mind so you can focus on what else might be going on in your life that is making you unhappy. One thing that helps me too is getting out doors even if it's just going for a walk. O and make sure you are drinking plenty of water.
f0325c9db2c253a4f4b9ab111e9c6c70aa	The best and strongest is Benadryl.<br>  <br>  This is what is used in Emergency rooms and Urgent Care Clinics (NOT allegra, zyrtec, or claritin....which are actually much weaker).<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Benadryl can be very sedating.  That is why most people do not take it.  Plus, most people think the prescription medications (Allegra and Zyrtec) must be more powerful than the over-the-counter medication, Benadryl.  They're wrong.  But Benadryl wipes me out for the day.  I even recommend it as a possible sleep aid, sometimes...!<br>  <br>  In an event, first try Benadryl, but try Benadryl for kids.  Your goal should be the minimal amount of medication to relieve yourself of symptoms.  Any more, and it is unnecessary and increase the risk of negative side effects (such as sedation).<br>  <br>  Benadryl for kids is the same as regular Benadryl, only it is a smaller dose.  It is 6.25mg.  Try that every 4-6 hours.  (Or get regular dose Benadryl and break it into fourths or in half...).  If symptoms are not completely relieved, try 12.5mg.  Keep going up to a maximum of 50mg every 6 hours.<br>  <br>  IF sedation becomes a problem, switch to Claritin.  It is a great drug that only fairly recently went over the counter - it use to be prescription only.<br>  <br>  However, DON'T buy Claritin....instead, go to Walmart and pick up Equate Brand Loratadine (Generic brand).  It is the SAME exact thing as Claritin...and you can get a bottle of 60 for less than $10.  Go to Sam's club, and it is even cheaper.  Take it only once a day (10mg a pill).  It works great for many people.<br>  <br>  If nasal symptoms are a big problem, you can try Oasis Nasal Spray (or Oasis Nasal Wash).  Right now, it is not sold at Walmart, but you can get it at Walgreens.  If you can't find Oasis, a simple nasal saline spray can relieve some symptoms.<br>  <br>  =<br>  In the end, if the above does not work, you may be forced to try prescription medications...such as Zyrtec or Allegra.  Though, the nasal steroids are much more effective (Nasarel, Nasonex, Flonase, Rhinocort).  There is variable success with Zyrtec and Allegra, but the nasal steroids all have been very successful (no one better than another, no matter what drug reps or TV commercials might say).<br>  <br>  Medications for allergies to animals are the same medications for allergies to other things (i.e. dust, mold, ragweed, pollen, etc.).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Grace and peace,<br>  yachadhoo<br>  ;)|`|AA10117437	zyrtec is the one, but it's only by prescription.

AA10299265	Yes. As long at the other one is still functioning. If you meant without either fallopian tube... then, no.|`|7004949c39e70a93848640fa7e7d5bc6aa	Without any, no. That is the funel (Basically) that the egg goes though to get to the uterus.|`|21cd5ddd3d35c277fee8996fb2d968e3aa	If the other one is still there and functioning then yes a woman can still get pregnant.  If there are no fallopian tubes present then no.|`|3eb1ed4de78c058e5a9a619e837cac50aa	If you still have one normally functioning and healthy fallopian tube, then your chances for getting pregnant are only 50% of what they would be if you had both. If you have one fallopian tube, but it has some significant damage to it, then the chances for you getting pregant are less than 50 %. However if you do not have either fallopian tube, then it is impossible for you to naturally become pregnat. However, it is possible for you to have children, but you will have to do this by a process called in-vitro fertilization.

For instance, alcohol and coffee are believed to give semen a bitter, pungent taste. <br>  <br>  There are many ingredients composing semen, and its makeup is the same from man to man. Here are a few of the constituent elements: vitamin C, calcium, chlorine, cholesterol, citric acid, creatine, fructose, lactic acid, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vitamin B12, and zinc. <br>  <br>  So what effect will all this have on her waistline? Well, not much of an effect at all. The caloric content of the average ejaculate is estimated to be approximately 5 to 25 calories -- hardly the most fattening meal. <br>  <br>  As well, cigarettes, garlic, onions, broccoli, and cauliflower are also believed to alter the taste of your love juice. The cigarettes need no explanation; you're inhaling fire, let's get real. But because the aforementioned foods tend to have a distinct odor, it's believed that they will affect the way you taste.<br>  <br>  If you're dehydrated, pig out on spicy foods or are taking medication, these factors may also contribute to an uninviting flavor. So maybe you should take it easy on Mexican delights and start downing water like there's no tomorrow.<br>  <br>  What To Eat/Drink: <br>  Plums <br>  Oranges <br>  Lemons <br>  Limes <br>  Cilantro <br>  Spearmint <br>  Grapefruit <br>  Green tea <br>  Beer <br>  Pineapple <br>  Mangoes <br>  Chamomile tea <br>  <br>  What To Avoid: <br>  Broccoli <br>  Brussels Sprouts <br>  Spices <br>  Coffee <br>  Chocolate <br>  Cigarettes <br>  Asparagus <br>  Chemically processed liquor <br>  Onions <br>  Garlic <br>  Dairy Products <br>  Red meat <br>  <br>  Considering most guys are avid meat eaters, keep in mind that red meat apparently makes semen taste more acidic. Hmm, nothing like the taste of acid to end off a wonderful night of sexual fun.<br>  To sweeten up your inner load, drink plenty of pineapple juice, and eat bananas and papaya. Their sweetness results in yours. And of course, lest we forget that parsley can do wonders for men worldwide -- it eliminates body odor, freshens breath and improves the taste of seminal fluid. <br>  <br>  Fruits like kiwi, watermelon, celery, and pineapple are all said to make semen taste lighter. Beer and coffee are believed to have something of an opposite effect, and could leave her with a bitter taste in the mouth. Alkaline-based foods like meat and fish produce a buttery taste, while acidic fruits (cranberries, blueberries and plums) produce a pleasant, sugary flavor. Most liqueurs will do the same, while dairy products can make for a foul taste because of their high bacterial putrefaction levels. <br>  <br>  Always keep in mind that everyone has a distinct taste and even if you do all these things, she might still find the taste of your fluid repulsive. But if she's more than willing and able to sacrifice for the greater good, then have her down a mint before she makes her way down south.<br>  The mint will serve to hinder the flavor of your semen and will simultaneously provide you with indescribable sensations.|`|AA12236672	I've never heard of that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ever wonder how the universe could allow the existence of someone as annoying as your bratty little brother or sister? The answer lies in reproduction. If people - like your parents (ew!) - didn't reproduce, families would die out and the human race would cease to exist.<br>  <br>  All living things reproduce. Reproduction - the process by which organisms make more organisms like themselves - is one of the things that sets living things apart from nonliving matter. But even though the reproductive system is essential to keeping a species alive, unlike other body systems it's not essential to keeping an individual alive.<br>  <br>  In the human reproductive process, two kinds of sex cells, or gametes (pronounced: gah-meetz), are involved. The male gamete, or sperm, and the female gamete, the egg or ovum, meet in the female's reproductive system to create a new individual. Both the male and female reproductive systems are essential for reproduction.<br>  <br>  <br>  Humans, like other organisms, pass certain characteristics of themselves to the next generation through their genes, the special carriers of human traits. The genes parents pass along to their children are what make children similar to others in their family, but they are also what make each child unique. These genes come from the father's sperm and the mother's egg, which are produced by the male and female reproductive systems.|`|17c39fec5138b4da371c06ab61f8595daa	It doesn't shrink but it can get less stiff as you get older.

AA12096119	What types of gastric problems are you in reference too?  There are numerous kinds that act differently for different people.  <br>  <br>  If your stomach is upset and you have diarrhea and other problems associated with that, you need to stick to the BRATT diet.  Bananas, Rice, Apples or Applesauce, Tea and Toast (dry). for about a week and see how you feel.  Also stay away from fried foods, greasy and fatty foods, spices, and sometimes high fiber foods and acidic foods like citrus.  But if your symptoms are different, I suggest you go and have yourself checked by your family physician.  He or she may recommend you to see a gastroenterologist about your stomach problems.  Medications and tests may be required.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and I hope you feel better soon!|`|c3023fd6250ccce24970be2b869e2b61aa	What gastric problem are you having? Try a high fiber diet.

Being that you are on a high dose of Paxil and your not well controlled, a therapeutic change may be necessary.  There are many other options asides from benzos, and I highly recommend you stay away from benzos as much as possible.  You're probably young, and long term use can lead to tolerance and addiction.

7a4d01685f8c5c781f44f45a7cd36078aa	Hi. one thing I use when  I was younger was a product called Noxema. Thoroughly wash you face then apply the product before going to bed.  In the morning wet a wash cloth with hot water (the hottest you can stand it). Wring out water and then wipe off the product gently, do not rub. Then follow it up with a splash of cold water.  This always helped me and made my face very soft.  I am now 46 years old and still uses the product to keep my face looking young. You can purchase this product at your local grocery and runs about $6.00.  If you experience a more serious breakout you may want to consult a dermatologist.

AA12359483	The best way to lower cholesterol and triglycerides and to reduce your risk of heart problems is to stop eating animal products and increase your exercise.<br>  <br>  Your liver makes all of the cholesterol that your body needs, so you shouldn't add extra cholesterol in your food.  Cholesterol is found only in animal products.  So stop eating all meats (beef, pork, chicken, fish and shell fish), eggs, cheese and milk. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about not getting enough protein because there is protein in all fruits and vegetables. <br>  <br>  Increase your exercise level to burn up extra calories so that they won't be converted to fat.  Also spending at least 30 minutes in the sun each day will help to reduce the cholesterol.<br>  <br>  Not only will you lower your cholesterol, but you will reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes.  And if you stick with it for the rest of your life, it may even help you to live healthier and longer.<br>  <br>  At first glance, you might think that I am just another moron pushing a vegan diet.

Had reached the point where I was smoking almost 2 CARTONS a week.  I tried everything to stop, patches, smokeless cigarettes, gum, hypnosis, and then Zyban, none worked for me.  One day I decided to take it ONE MINUTE at a time.  Seriously, 1 minute at a time! I kept telling myself that I would wait just one more minute and TEN I would go smoke.  I kept doing this,  It was extremely difficult, and I couldn't focus on anything except the fact that I was NOT smoking.  My thoughts are to get that nicotine OUT of your body, that is why I was not a big fan of the patch.  Don't feel like a failure if you don't make it either.  Don't let anyone make you feel badly or guilty either.This is EXTREMELY difficult, but it CAN be done.  Good luck to you, and to anyone else trying.  Hang in there.  Tell yourself that you are NOT going to let these cigarettes control you.  <br>  I am not sure if there is anything new out there that will help you, because it has been a while since I smoked.  GOOD LUCK!|`|b5fd69d1fe9b513068a36526c0ad89bfaa	Hi,<br>  I would suggest the new inexpensive laser technology.

They may suggest wellbuturin which helps the same way. I know others that have used Wellbuturin and it did work for them. I am not really sure about any side effects though. My boyfriend is currently in the process of quitting smoking with the patches but he is contemplating getting the gum instead and just using that when he has an uncontrollable urge for a cigarette rather than wearing the patch all the time. I am next to quit so I understand the feeling. I have quit before and I drank a lot of water with a straw every time I wanted a cigarette or sugarfree suckers. It kind of helped trick my mind into not wanting to hold a cigarette. Hope this helps some and Good luck! It is a hard battle to quit but you can do it!|`|38adc1e9ba3de58eee758ec770cbf3f9aa	zyban helps|`|5992390524fd4cc0f945aa5d53b4fe93aa	just quit.<br>  its a mental fight with yourself, youl win.

Given it is Rare, it wasn't cooked to as high a temperature or as long, so more fat remains in the steak than if it were cooked out being done to, say, Medium Well.<br>  <br>  I will guess at maybe half an ounce of fat, 15 grams, so about 980 calories minus maybe 50-80 calories for the undigestible portion and juices that leak out and you do not sop up somehow and eat.<br>  <br>  Naturally, there is variance for the cut's weight.

3cad7fca8a1ace63407d2de9d0cbc874aa	You have my same issue!  u need to see a GI specialist and they will give you a colonoscopy and an endoscopy!  Which is actaully a simple procedure I have had 3 endoscopies and a bravo surgery in my esophagus and Im only 23!  Ive had acid refluxz amongst many other digestive issues for years now!  Sometimes acid can get into your lungs and that can cause an issue with breathing... It also can cause chest pain and discomfort as well!  They will probably put you on a proton pump inhibitor if you do have at such as aciphex, protonix, nexium, etc!  I had issues with nexium but protonix is nice... I have acid reflux so bad that I have to take 2 a day!  Avoid.... Caffine, Alcohol, Cigs, Weed, Spices, Chocolate, Fried Food, etc!  I could give you the whole lowdown on what you need to do but Ill leave that for your doctor!  Unfortunatley the only way to diagnose it is through an endoscopy... They wqill sedate you (which is quite nice) and stick a long camera tube down your throat... Into your esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestines too look for erosions, etc!  Acid Reflux is very common!  Ok as for my diagnosis I found out that I have acid reflux, I once was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia, I was also diagnosed with Colonic Inertia, and Gastritis... I have been where you are you will get through this it is manageable... If you have any further questions feel free to ask!|`|25026c155f8a5d0b94ec42790c58d42caa	About four months ago I started having a burning feeling in my stomach and nausea every day. At first I thought I had a stomach ulcer because after I ate I would feel better for about an hour or so. Then the nausea started getting really bad. My stomach felt really full. I started getting the....uhhhh...poopers. Eventually I started throwing up. I made an appointment with a gastro and they did a breath test for some bacteria that causes stomach ulcers. They also took blood, but they didn't find anything. I had an endoscopy done and they told me I had a hiatal hernia. The acid reflux and throw up were caused by that. I've been on nexium for a few weeks and it helps a lot but I still feel sick sometimes.<br>  I think that if your stomach feels full even if you haven't eaten that much, that's a problem.<br>  If you lay down at night and have some nasty burny throw up stuff that comes up, that's probably acid reflux. I used to wake up choking on it. It burns way bad. It's pretty easy to tell the difference between heartburn and acid reflux if you'd have them.<br>  If you've lost weight suddenly or have a decreased appetite I would go to the gastro. That also happened to me.<br>  If your stomach itself, like not your throat or anything, but your stomach hurts or burns, then it might be an ulcer or a hernia.<br>  If you're really worried ask for an endoscopy, I think they can find out a lot that way. Hope I helped. I know a lot of that was off topic, but for the longest I thought that I just had acid reflux and it turned out to be something else.|`|64da71e88028f47f156ebb58053762c3aa	My symptoms include the typical burning sensation behind the breastbone, occasional trouble swallowing, and sometimes even severe chest pain. I've learned to avoid foods that aggrevate my heartburn - for me it's acidy foods like orange juice and tomato products. I also take Prilosec, which turns off the acid pumps in your stomach, allowing your esophagus to heal. Good luck, and I hope you feel better soon!|`|f4cc98e5fbb18a4d5100d89a899da278aa	I suffer from acid reflux. Many times I awaken with a sore throat, (from the acid in my stomach coming up). I also get chest discomfort, chest pains, etc.  Try sleeping so you are not lying flat at night. Elevate your head and upper body.  <br>  <br>  Do find a better doc. They will probably want to scope you, (endoscopy). They make you sleep, put a tube down your throat and look around your stomach and esophagus with a fiber optic light. They can see if you have erosions, or problems this way.<br>  They will give you meds to help.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f08bc52ceb31e513b6f51438f72de619aa	Some of your symptoms sound much like mine...I started with acid reflux, but the chest pain and shortness of breath is from a hiatal hernia. You need an upper GI to find out what's going on for sure. Don't panic, if it IS a hernia, it can be controlled with meds.<br>  Good luck.|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	You can be fairly certain of it if six Rolaids won't stop the the feeling.<br>  <br>  You can be very certain if you feel it in your esophogus -- food tube.  If it feels like an oven with a chimney and the flames are coming up the chimney, that's serious.<br>  <br>  When a handfull of Baking Soda only stops it for a while it's serious.<br>  <br>  If you do lots of sugar (soda, candy, sweet rolls), STOP.  I found sugar to be a major offender.<br>  <br>  I was to the point where a salad would give me heartburn and I couldn't be in the same room with Chili and Onions.<br>  <br>  After six months of no sugar.  No sodas (even diet sodas), no candy bars, no sweet rolls.  My need for the little pill ceased, and I no longer needed to have Rolaids around<br>  <br>  THe only ill I kept was coffee with artificial creamer.<br>  <br>  I replaced sodas with water.<br>  <br>  After that I could eat Chili, Onions, cucumbers with no gas or problems.<br>  <br>  Sugars burn the stomach lining.<br>  <br>  Under NO circumstances take milk.  It's far worse than any sugar.<br>  <br>  That thing about milk for an ulcer is total fabrication.<br>  <br>  No fruit juices either, like orange.<br>  <br>  So, if you are doing gobs of sugar. STOP right now, cut them OUT of your diet.  See what happens in six months to a year.<br>  <br>  The little pill (Zantax) does help.|`|c3023fd6250ccce24970be2b869e2b61aa	I take Nexium for it and it helps big time. It only happens for me right after I eat something spicy or something with red sauce in it. So I take one right before I eat and I'm fine. But if I don't take it then afterwards I have a burning feeling in my throat that won't go away. Especially when I lay down it gets even worse. See a Gastroenterologist and they can help you (if your not already doing so). Good luck!

Benedryl does that to me.|`|AA12172557	benadryl should help a little bit, but like the other answer said, it'll mainly help by getting you to sleep.  If you're willing to stay up a little bit, Sudafed (pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine) should help more in terms of getting rid of the stuffy nose part, especially if it's causing a cough from post-nasal drip.

Synthroid is often prescribed or Levoxyl.  If you have it, you need to get regular blood tests so the Doctor can adjust your medication if needed.  Some of the symptoms include fatigue and susceptibility to cold.  If you think you have this, make an appointment with your doctor who can order a blood test.|`|651026ed93d3a8cc465459add690e982aa	Hypo-thyroidism means you're not getting what you need to get thru the day.  Synthroid can be prescribed by a doctor to boost your energy level, calm your irregular heartbeat and help avoid the lethargy and foggy headedness. As a result, your weight should drop with increased energy to do more than laze around.   But you do need to se a doctor.  This is nothing to play with.

My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.<br>  <br>  Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world.

It's not that they're *always* thinking about breasts, it's just that when they see them, they look or stare, maybe in admiration/disbelief/whatever.  If you see a nice looking guy walk down the street, wouldn't you look/stare at him?  It's pretty much the same thing.  You're not constantly thinking about hot guys, you just see something you like and continue to look at it.  However, it is pretty disgusting when you're trying to have a conversation with a guy and he's constantly looking at your chest, but it happens!

187c083657d9bad44a324e7c62384f63aa	Mono is mostly spread through kissing. That's why it's called the "kissing disease", but to answer your question yes it's a possiblity it can be spread through sharing cigarettes. Mono is spread through saliva, tears, mucous membranes, basically any bodily fluids.|`|6ecbbaab47dec260c34f8586cd1a6a28aa	Yup from the saliva on them..|`|9eae0aabde02a8ee6b10e26f4d85c95faa	yes|`|d55001f2044da1319e3374646176fbceaa	That really depends.  It is seriously not recommended to eat or drink after someone with mono, however, even though there is not a lot of saliva being transferred by sharing a cigarrette, if your immune system is compromised, you could certainly catch it.  I had it myself, have no idea where I contracted it, and it took three months to diagnose.  Good luck with it.
68d13f7e388e7e85d5315a6142111ac1aa	Anal Info<br>  <br>  The anus is the opening at the end of the rectum from which solid waste (feces) leaves the body. It's located right between the buttocks — behind the vagina in women and behind the testicles in men. Muscles inside and outside the anus, called "sphincters," open to let feces out or close to hold it in.<br>  <br>  The anus is full of thousands of nerve endings both inside and outside, making it very sensitive. For some people, the anus is an erogenous zone that can respond to sexual touch and stimulation. For others, it's a hands-off zone that needs to be respected. It's okay to enjoy anal stimulation, and it's also okay to dislike it — both preferences are common.<br>  <br>  Anal Sex<br>  <br>  Anal sex play is often associated with gay men. However, many men and women, regardless of whether they're gay, lesbian, straight, or bisexual, enjoy anal stimulation. And many, including gay men, don't. Some straight couples use anal sex as a way to preserve the woman's virginity. For those who like it, anal stimulation can be part of masturbation, intercourse, or oral sex.<br>  <br>  Anal intercourse is sex play that involves insertion of the penis or a sex toy into the anus. "Rimming" is slang for oral stimulation of the anus. Both acts, if unprotected, can put each partner at risk for various intestinal parasites, hepatitis, herpes, and other sexually transmitted infections. Unprotected anal intercourse is, of course, high risk for HIV. Proper use of latex barriers — condoms for anal intercourse and Glyde? dams for rimming — can reduce the risk of contracting an infection. It's important to use a water-based lubricant with condoms — it makes anal sex feel better and makes condoms less likely to break.<br>  <br>  Anal Health<br>  <br>  Hygiene is important for good anal health, but there's no need to overdo it. Washing daily with a mild soap and water will keep the anus clean. Harsh soaps or wiping vigorously with toilet paper can irritate the skin around the anus, making it itchy or sore. Penetration with a penis or sex toy can irritate or tear the inside of the anus. Use common sense — pay attention to how your body feels during anal stimulation, and stop if you feel pain or discomfort. And if you do play with sex toys for anal sex, make sure to use condoms on them and keep them clean, especially if they are shared.<br>  <br>  The anus is a frequent site of sexually transmitted infection. If you notice any pain, sores, discharge, or lumps around or inside the anus, make an appointment with a clinician as soon as possible|`|187c083657d9bad44a324e7c62384f63aa	Ok. I really don't understand your question, but your rectal area is supposed to be tight. It's an exit only.
c47da15fdc6e17571ad7443290e6bf9baa	That depends on who you think has control of your life...<br>  <br>  Finances?<br>  Spouse?<br>  Parents?<br>  Kids?  No wait, they do control your life...lol|`|2444925817cadfa8e8a5ec6ecab656c6aa	It sounds like you may be a bit depressed, and that can often cause one to feel like they're losing control of their life.  It can often cause one to feel lazy, unmotivated, lack of goals, etc. <br>  <br>   When I started feeling like that I joined a gym and started working out every day. It helped me physically, because I had more energy and felt better, and it helped me mentally because I started liking the way I was looking with less pounds...and therefore I started paying more attention to what I was eating.<br>  <br>  I am a firm believer that it all ties together...exercise, good health, good diet, good attitude.<br>  <br>  As far as your career, if that's one of your issues, and you are still young, you may want to ask yourself what you enjoy doing as far as working is concerned, and maybe consider taking some classes at  a local college. I did that also to better my skills.<br>  <br>  I do wish you the best, and I do hope this is just a phase for you.|`|04bf55783a7d5a2e787236c49c29fa37aa	I don't really know either. I am also in my mid 30's and I don't feel like I have control or know where I am going. I do like my job but the pay sucks. I have kids but they mostly don't listen to me. I am married but I feel alone. I would like to have friends to hang out with but I don't have the time or energy to do so. I would love to go places or get new things but it cost to much money that I don't have. So, all I do is get up, go to work, come home to a dirty house because no one wants to help out and go to bed. That's my life. Sorry I cant help you out but maybe you can see others relate with you.|`|187c083657d9bad44a324e7c62384f63aa	You're too young to be going through a mid life crisis. That normally doesn't start until when you're in your 40's somewhere. You have to take some time to yourself and think what is going on around you that you have no control over your life. In all actuality you can regain control over your life, you feel that way because you're not doing anything to stop this force from controlling you. Get back on your feet and take back what is rightfully yours.|`|3dc2bfa8aa5ecc6cad23f493c698ed9caa	I go thru this every day of my life. Depending on people sucks. Let's just be honest. So to take control.. Hmm... go back to school. Education is the best way to rise above, have greater income, and learn more. Also, do what you love.. whether that means, quit your job and pursue your dream job. (if you can financially afford it) Make a change. Be strong. You've already taken a step by asking this question.. Good Luck!|`|b876d785917d974983059b143d96b71baa	It is just a passing phase you are going through. All of us are going through it. I am in my 30s too and I feel the same way too. No matter how much you attain in life, it is as if we have not done enough. I would suggest that try and find some peace of mind,everything will fall in place on its own once you are at peace with yourself. <br>  Try meditation and try to be happy always no matter what your situation is.|`|ffeb6aae1acd5ec113237555f0896bdaaa	Yes it is <br>  <br>  But if you would  like to feel better make a short list of a few aspects of your life that you think are out of control .<br>  then work on the ones you think you can gain control of easly . as you feel better work on more <br>  <br>  The first step to solving any personal problem is admiting there is one .<br>  <br>  you have already done that so your on your way already and you didnt even know it!!!! ..good luck!

Everybody masturbates....George Bush masturbates, Osama Bin laden masturbates etc...<br>  <br>  The only known problem is if you use poor technique.   Some masturbate by tucking their penis down and pushing it against their scrotum while lying face down on the bed.  Its bad because it can cause a downward kink of the penis and also restricts semen flow when you ejaculate, which risks damaging the prostate.<br>  Nothing wrong with the good old fist method.|`|AA11619840	not at all.|`|59196925dc0ffd7d1db0ba0f1c412327aa	Masturbation is a normal, great release.

31b9d943eeebee817b486384aaf5dc76aa	If they are reacting that strongly, perhaps you really do not need to lose weight and they are worried. Have them take you to a doctor and get the doctor's opinion on your height/weight proportion. If the doctor says you need to lose weight, maybe they'll be ok with it. If not, then maybe you need to just work on being healthy and don't focus on your weight. It's not everything.|`|eddf2c7c18c3c71099e60960010d2a13aa	there are a lot of issues here.  First of all, ask your doctor if they feel you are overweight they are the best source of information about this, then worry about your diet.  Second, if your parents are really hitting , well thats a bigger problem that i think is beyond the scope of what a person on yahoo answers can help you with.  You should ask and adult you trust to help you with that.|`|2431224967e2a63db4c34b7788a21fb5aa	I know that you feel that you are not "right" because of all the pressure from celebrities and models, for example.

Maybe you don't need to lose weight, but I wouldn't be able to tell you since you didn't provide that in your post. If you truly believe you should diet and lose weight then you need to sit your parents down and explain to them why. Do some research on it and let them know the effects of it on your body. Maybe you get short of breath easy, you have backache, etc. And maybe they will understand then. But ONLY do it if it's necessary! Best wishes!|`|47477b31d36f9157dc4722a50a07816aaa	I agree w/ gdubs.

Don't worry too much about it.|`|AA12400553	I too was recently diagnosed with it, but I knew something was up all along.

I'm 45 yrs old and have been dealing with for a long tome. Do some research and completly understand what ADD is and TRUST me she will be okay.<br>  Here's some info for you:add & adhd are treated almost the same check out webmd<br>  <br>  Day One …<br>  We're here to help.<br>  <br>  Odds are, your first response on hearing you might have adult ADHD was, "It's a kids' problem, isn't it?" <br>  <br>  The fact is that at least half of children with ADHD -- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- continue to have problems as adults. If you do indeed have adult ADHD, you're one of them. But you're not alone. Some 4% of U.S. adults are in the same boat. <br>  <br>  ADHD begins in childhood. At least some symptoms always appear by age 7. You've made it this far. Clearly you've been coping with your symptoms. Maybe you even use them to your advantage. But the fact that you're getting diagnosed with adult ADHD now means that you need help. <br>  <br>  And help is available. <br>  <br>  Several clinical trials show that many of the stimulant drugs that help children with ADHD may also help those with adult ADHD. Particularly helpful may be the longer-lasting formulations of these medications, which are better suited to adult lifestyles. As of this writing, the only FDA-approved drug for adult ADHD is the nonstimulant Strattera. The FDA has not yet approved stimulant drugs such as Ritalin for adult ADHD, although doctors can prescribe them if they choose. However, medication alone isn't the whole treatment for adult ADHD. <br>  <br>  It's likely you'll also need behavioral and emotional support for your adult ADHD. It's wise to seek the help of a psychologist or psychiatrist. Why is this so important? About three out of four adults with ADHD also suffer from other problems. These include depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, alcohol and substance abuse, and learning disabilities. It's unlikely that treatment for any of these problems will succeed unless ADHD is identified and treated as well. And just treating adult ADHD probably won't make other disorders go away. <br>  <br>  By getting a diagnosis of adult ADHD, you've taken an important first step. Many adults with ADHD lead fulfilling lives. You can be one of them. <br>  <br>  Yours in health,<br>  Daniel J. DeNoon

I have been prescribed Wellbutrin XR in the past, and those are the symptoms that I had.  Although I had those things already, they were amplified by the Wellbutrin XR.  You should talk to your prescribing doctor about other medication alternatives.  Wellbutrin XR is a slow acting medication also.... so it depends on how long you've been taking it.  There are several antidepressants that are new and don't have very many side effects.  Have you tried Cymbalta?  There are too many for me to list.  But you should have your doctor give you something different and talk with him/her about how this medication is making you feel.  You might have to take several different ones to find the right one, so don't give up!!  Hope this helps.|`|6aa637081787af6839ab703367394dc1aa	1) talk to your doctor about it. <br>  <br>  2) I was on Wellbutrin XL, 1st 150 mg, then 300mg -- I was better off NOT taking it. Why?

As I lean over the cake the side of my hair catches on fire.  My uncle sitting near me imediately saw it and clapped my hair between his hands to put out the flame.  This was all caught on movie camera.  (yes long before video cameras)  The smell of burnt hair is not nice.|`|7946413b5c517335c5d46059a0118b10aa	yeah when I used to smoke weed which was stupid. it smelt like someone died on top of a dead guy. nasty smell.|`|1726f4faa2554d28f5d78ef3e99df9e2aa	no. what did you do?|`|c02739710142475c523039cd21487792aa	No but my daughter has. One day we were sitting at the living room table where there were 2 scented candles lit and we were eating taco's. My daughter was 3 years old at the time and she tilted her head so she could bite her taco and one of her pony tails went right into the little flame and her pony tail was on fire and she didn't even notice it until I swatted the flames out with my bare hands she looked at me like I was crazy because she was just sitting there chewing like nothing ever happened.

Do you recall bible stories about Sodom and Gomorrah? The word implies an act of carnal knowledge, specifically anal sex.<br>  <br>  I certainly hope you are a young adult and not a child. The story you mentioned sounds like perhaps some man couldn't control himself and had sex with a dog.  Disgusting isn't it?<br>  <br>  I do hope this is helpful for you and that I have been "informative without being gross." You might want to discuss this with your parents.

When I started my birth control for the first time it totally threw my period off balance and I would spot here and there, but it eventually got better.|`|cb9ec89ad396f80b672632e8b5f46a88aa	What  is the possibility that you are pregnant? Any? Spotting is a sign of pregnancy.  And if it only lasted for 2 hours then this doesn't sound like a regular period.  However I have had periods in the past where I would start and then a day later it would stop completely, and then hours later start back up again.  It could be possible that you are experiencing the same thing.

c3023fd6250ccce24970be2b869e2b61aa	I had all 4 of mine taken out at once and it was really bad. My face didn't swell up, but I was allergic to the medication (Vicodin) they gave me for the pain.. So, I was throwing up because I swallowed so much blood. I don't know if I would do the interview a few days after the surgery. It took me about a week and a half before I could eat normal again. It still felt uncomfortable afterwards. Drink alot of V8 juice and alot of OJ. Best wishes!|`|316ee24160431dbaceb23df61e47274daa	I had all 3 taken out at once.  Had minimal facial swelling and no bruising. I didn't find it that bad, took pain pills for the first 36 hours then went to regular Tylenol.  Just take it easy and bite down on the gauze pads, try eating protein enriched soups like lentil, to promote healing.|`|168c007f36ca5e4cee2f2dff5046c7daaa	I had my widom teeth cut out.. I was sore for a few days, but no bursing or swelling. Your Dentist should prescribe you a pain killer. Don't drink from a straw or drink hot liquids, you'll disloge a blood clot then have problems, also no smoking or even brushing your teeth for the first day. Also a cold compress and biting on gaze helps. Get plenty of rest and drink nutritious liquids...100% fruit juice, protein drinks, or milk.. I think you'll be great for your interview!!!!|`|2542917cf9f5fb58972ecc19d5698dfcaa	Most people recover fairly quickly but not everyone.  I had a difficult time when I had all 4 of mine removed but you may not.  To promote healing, start taking Vitamin C, Vitamin B complex, Vitamin E, Zinc, and Soy Protein as soon as you can get your hands on some.  Also, my chiropractor prescribed a product called Bio-Dent from Standard Process, Inc. that I purchased from the chiropractor- my difficulties stopped when I began taking this supplement.  He recommends people take it before and after any dental work.<br>  <br>  Follow the doctor's instructions exactly!!  No straws (sucking can remove blood clots which is painful and slows healing), rinse with salt water after 24 hours (promotes healing), Ice packs for the first day or so and then warm packs, no smoking (slows healing and produces the same sucking action as a straw), soft foods for as long as you can stand it (I recommend meal replacement shakes because you are getting good nutrition which you need to heal- i.e. SlimFast, Shaklee,etc.)  <br>  <br>  I ate alot of chocolate and used mint candy to help with the foul odor but I found out after the fact that all the sugar from these actually slows healing as well.  So, if you need a breath freshener- try one of those sprays or something without sugar.<br>  <br>  Also, use the narcotic pain reliever(Tylenol 3, vicodin, percocet, etc)  if you truly need it only.  These all cause constipation and no one wants to deal with that.  Ask your dentist, what over the counter pain relievers can be used with your prescription.<br>  <br>  After a couple days, if you get an ache that won't go away and seems to radiate up toward your ear and down your jaw line- you have dry socket (the blood clot fell out) and need to see a dentist for medicine that they will put down in the hole to relieve the pain and promote tissue growth.  If the doctor who removed your teeth is some distance from you, check with your local dentist about this problem- some of them will help you with this so you don't have to drive all that way to the surgeons.<br>  <br>  Follow doctor's orders, rest, rest, rest (with head elevated), and you will do fine!  Best of luck to you!|`|Plx9Pkuhaa	You could still have a swollen jaw and a bit of bruising. I had both. The swelling started the day I got them out and lasted about 3-4 days and the bruising came once the swelling went down. <br>  <br>  Rinse with warm salt water<br>  Take you medication (for me I got codine w/ Tylenol and it made me nauseus).<br>  <br>  Be careful of dry sockets or pockets whatever they call it lol...that's when bacteria starts to get into where your teeth were extracted. This my friend is PAINFUL. So if you are feeling discomfort a week or so after your extraction please call you dentist right away! They will numb you and insert something that will remove the bacteria (this is a bit uncomfortable too). As soon as they took care of this though I felt 100x better! <br>  <br>  I'm not going to lie...for me personally it was the worst thing I went through and took me a good 3-4 days to not feel like crap. I had 4 impacted teeth that required an outpatient stay in a hospital (which is uncommon but my doctor preferred me in the hospital). I did not come out of the anestesia right away so I ended up sleeping most of the day when of course I wasn't throwing up!! I am not trying to scare you but some people take it better then others. For me I didn't take it too well. Everyone's different. I had friends who had no problems whatsoever. Good luck!
80bb87677d8929ca4ce706abcdf1b5d7aa	My reasoning would be because you have upped and downed the levels of your hormones so many times with the implant and than the pill and everything that your hormones need to leveled out with a low dose hormone to bring everything back to normal.

Too many chemicals in your body and it needs to regulate itself. Other than what you're already doing (seeing the doc), I would just give your body time. Also, maybe visit a healthfood store and look at their fertility "stuff" - a lot of that is meant to regulate your body. Good luck.|`|AA10040769	Usually it takes about 2-3 months for your body to get used to not having the hormones anymore.  With this switching around, it is most likely that you have a hormonal imbalance occurring.

Hope it helps.|`|20bc3c647200c3eed41c7c1ead60eb62aa	Chills occur when you body temperature starts to drop and chills are actually to warm up your body. But when you have a fever you don't need to warm up, but as the fever drops your body tries to warm you up anyway (because it is a little confused) by giving you the chills. They are usually a good sign because it means the fever is starting to go down so the infection causing the fever is starting to be better controlled by your bodies immune system. <br>  <br>  Notice that when you don't have a fever but are just in the cold for a long time and you started get chilled and have chills. Then you body is not confused and is really trying to make you warmer by all the muscular activity in the skin.|`|0cffd3d72d03d354794e42ffd1548f2faa	i get that too and i dont know either
AA11985760	At your age, you still can "grow into" your weight. All you have to do is add more activities to your daily routine - walk/bike to more places, swim, join a sports team, try yoga, dance, etc. And don't eat too much junk food like chips and fast food burgers. Once in a while is ok, but eat it only in moderation.|`|bb475022702b8b2fab4c209fe3889bccaa	A proper diet is the best way to lose weight naturally and keep it off. You have to eat a varied adequate and balanced diet. Your body needs all kinds of food to function properly including fat in smaller quantities though. Your body needs the nutrients and vitamins in fruits and vegetables the most, that is what you should eat the most of (at least 5 servings a day). You also need protein, and a little fat. Reduce your intake of sweets, fried food and foods that contain a lot of fat. Don't drink too many alcoholic beverages or soft drinks (they have a lot of calories). Don't go to sleep right after you eat. And finally exercise at least 3 to 4 days a week for about 45 minutes.Good luck.

DO NOT drink water when you are choking that will make it worse. Encourage coughing to get the offending food up. To make you feel more at ease try taking a first aid course.

Ni5IUp5Vaa	Herpes Zoster, auch Gürtelrose genannt, wird durch das Varizella-Zoster-Virus beim erwachsenen Menschen ausgel?st. Dieses Virus geh?rt zur Familie der Herpesviren und wird h?ufig bereits in der Kindheit übertragen und verursacht in dieser Lebensphase die Windpocken.<br>  <br>  <br>  Als Erreger dieser Erkrankung ist das Varizella-Zoster-Virus (VZV) – auch als Humanes-Herpes-Virus-3 (HHV-3) bezeichnet – nachgewiesen. Dieses Virus ist ein behülltes, doppelstr?ngiges DNA-Virus (dsDNA) und geh?rt zur Familie der Herpesviridae, zur Unterfamilie Alphaherpesvirinae und zur Gattung der Varicellaviren. Alle Viren dieser Familie sind mit einem ikosaedrischen Kapsid (mit einer aus Dreiecksfl?chen bestehenden Proteinhülle) ausgestattet, die jeweils noch von einer Hüllmembran umgeben ist. Das Varizella-Zoster-Virus ist mit den Herpes-simplex-Viren nahe verwandt.<br>  <br>  Sch?tzungen zufolge sind rund 90 Prozent der über-14-j?hrigen Europ?er durch Windpocken-Infektionen bereits Tr?ger von Varizella-Zoster-Viren. Die Tatsache, dass au?er bei erheblich vorgesch?digten Menschen und bei nicht erfolgter Doppelinfektion oder Sekund?rinfektion (siehe auch Infektion) die von diesen Erregern verursachte Erkrankung nur extrem selten einen t?dlichen Verlauf nimmt, zeigt zum Einen, dass diese Viren stark an den Menschen als ihren Reservoirwirt angepasst sind. Die Sch?digung des Reservoirwirts bis hin zu seinem Tod ist für ein Virus kein vorteilhafter Effekt, da es zur eigenen Vermehrung auf diesen Wirt angewiesen ist. Die dennoch von diesem Virus beim Reservoirwirt ausgel?sten Erkrankungen sind letztlich nur Nebeneffekte der Infektion. Zum Zweiten zeigt sich, dass sich auch der Mensch im Verlauf vieler Generationen an dieses Virus anpasste.<br>  <br>  Krankheitsverlauf/Symptome  [Bearbeiten]Das Nervengewebe entzündet sich bei einer Aktivierung des latenten Virus. Die Inkubationszeit betr?gt 14-16 Tage. Symptome sind Brennen und teils starke Schmerzen in dem Hautbereich, der durch den betroffenen Nervenstrang versorgt wird und in dem Nervenstrang selbst. Gelegentlich ist vorher allgemeines Unwohlsein, Müdigkeit, Ermattung und leichtes Fieber zu beobachten. Vor dem eigentlichen Ausbruch der Krankheit treten h?ufig Schmerzen in mehr oder weniger gro?en Bereichen des K?rpers auf, in denen sich das Nervengewebe entzündet. Deshalb leiden manche kurz vor dem eigentlichen Krankheitsausbruch an Rückenschmerzen, Zahnschmerzen oder ?hnlichem. Zwei bis drei Tage nach Auftreten der anf?nglichen Schmerzen treten leicht erhabene, ger?tete Stellen auf, die im weiteren Verlauf Kn?tchen und dann Bl?schen bilden. Die Bl?schen füllen sich mit einer klaren oder wei?en, eitrigen Flüssigkeit, welche infekti?s ist. Die R?tung und Bl?schenbildung tritt normalerweise stark lokalisiert (um den Nervenstrang) und meistens nur auf einer K?rperseite auf; in seltenen F?llen kann es zu beidseitigem Befall kommen. In einigen F?llen kann der Ausschlag aber auch ganz ausbleiben. Nach einigen Tagen platzen die Bl?schen auf und verschorfen. Diese Phase kann 1-4 Wochen dauern.<br>  <br>  Die Lokalisation der Gürtelrose wird durch das Versorgungsgebiet des befallenen Nerven bestimmt. Meistens tritt Zoster im Bereich des Brustkorbes auf (Interkostalnerven). Gelegentlich k?nnen auch Rücken, Arme oder Beine betroffen sein. Bei Zoster ophthalmicus sind Gesicht und Augen betroffen (Nervus ophthalmicus aus dem Nervus trigeminus). Sind die Augen betroffen, kann durch Hornhautvernarbung teilweise oder vollst?ndige Erblindung die Folge sein. Bei Befall der Gesichtsnerven (Nervus facialis) kann es zu vorübergehenden L?hmungserscheinungen oder Verlust des Geschmackssinns kommen. Zoster oticus bezeichnet einen Befall des Geh?rgangs. M?gliche Folgen sind hier neben den Zoster-typischen starken Schmerzen Schwerh?rigkeit (Nervus cochlearis) und St?rungen des Gleichgewichtssinnes (Nervus vestibularis). Unbehandelt k?nnen dauerhafte H?rbeeintr?chtigungen oder Taubheit die Folge sein. Zoster generalisatus bezeichnet einen Befall des gesamten Nervensystems; diese Krankheitsform ist lebensbedrohlich, tritt aber üblicherweise nur bei starker prim?rer Schw?chung des Immunsystems auf (z. B. bei AIDS, Leuk?mie oder anderen Krebs-Formen). Herpes Zoster tritt auch im Genitalbereich auf. Er zieht über das ganze Geschlechtsteil gro?fl?chig bis auf die Oberschenkel. Im Lymphabflussgebiet des betroffenen Hautareals lassen sich nicht selten aktivierte Lymphknoten nachweisen.|`|CfqY00pxaa	definitiv ja. n?mlich dann z.bsp. wenn du sie am hals bekommst. sie w?chst um den hals herum, zieht sich zusammen und du erstickst. unabh?ngig davon, kann sie an jeder anderen k?rperstelle so unangenehm werden, das du sie früher oder sp?ter bestimmt behandeln l??t. weil sie kann <br>  pervers jucken, genauso schmerzen.<br>  wenn ich richtig informiert bin, ist herpes auch eine form der gürtelrose.<br>  auch ist sie nicht ansteckend!!!!!!!! jedoch wohl vererbar.<br>  gef?hrlich kann herpes auch beim gv werden. weil wenn man da irgendwo ein offenen herpes/ gürtelrose hat und es dann zu einer schwangerschaft kommt, ist die wahrscheinlichkeit, dass das kind eine fehlbildung davon tr?gt, sehr gro?.<br>  <br>  welch hirni gab mir denn da den d. runter? das sind mir die richtigen. selbst nix in der birne und/ aber andere beurteilen.|`|Jz17ysRHaa	Nein, glücklicherweise nicht. Auch nicht wenn die Gürtelrose den ganzen Rumpf erfasst hat. Das ist auch nicht m?glich, denn der Erreger der Gürtelrose - ein Virus namens Varizella-Zoster - bef?llt Nervenzellen im Bereich des Rückenmarks. Die bl?schenf?rmige Hauterkrankung  bildet sich dann exakt in dem Versorgungsgebiet des Nerven, der befallen ist - im Bereich des Rumpfes sind das gürtelf?rmige Areale, die der Erkrankung ihren Namen gegeben haben. Erkranken kann man nur, wenn man früher bereits einmal die Windpocken hatte. Denn die Gürtelrose wird durch die gleichen Viren ausgel?st, die Jahrzehnte durch die Windpocken nochmals in den Nervenzellen aktiv werden.|`|Lyz6OSRbaa	Man kann dran Sterben, auch wenn man behandelt wird ohne Behandlung kann man es nicht ertragen.

Sie finden aber in der ”Edelsteinheilkunde der Hildegard von Bingen” aus dem Lüchow Verlag eine praktische Zusammenfassung über die <br>  Erfahrungen und Heilungserfolge, die wir in den letzten 20 Jahren bei über 10 000 Patienten beobachten konnten. Die hier folgenden Aussagen sind historische Original - Zitate aus der Physika von Hildegard von Bingen aus dem 12. Jhdt. und ersetzen keinesfalls den Besuch beim Arzt oder Heilpraktiker zur Behandlung von ernsthaften Erkrankungen.Edelsteine haben sowohl heilende als auch schützende Eigenschaften und kommen der Sehnsucht vieler Menschen nach einer zeitlos wirksamen nebenwirkungsfreien Arznei entgegen. Im Vergleich zu anderen Heilmittel behalten sie immer ihre Wirkung. Je mehr man sie anwendet, umso st?rker ist ihre Wirkung. Aufgrund ihrer ungew?hnlichen Heilwirkung erreichen Edelsteine besonders auch seelische und geistige Bereiche, in denen die meisten Krankheiten entstehen. Diese Ebenen sind für alle anderen Heilmittel meistens unerreichbar. Die Edelsteinkr?fte erreichen s?mtliche K?rperzellen und verursachen Regeneration, Schutz und St?rkung unserer Abwehrkr?fte, soda? sie in der Lage sind unsere Gesundheit, Vitalit?t und Lebensqualit?t zu verbessern. Wie wirken die Heilkr?fte der Edelsteine?: Der Grund für die Heilkraft der Edelsteine liegt eindeutig an der Strahlennatur  der Kristalle. Sp?testens durch die Quantenphysik wei? man, da? jede Materie auch eine Energieausstrahlung hat, die auf alle anderen K?rper einwirkt. Die auf dem Kristallgitter sitzenden Atome schwingen in einen ganz pr?zisen Rhythmus und erzeugen dabei eine Gitterschwingung. Diese  Gitterschwingung in der Gr??enordnung unserer Nervenstr?me wird auf die Schwach- und Schmerzstellen des K?rpers übertragen und die Defekte damit ausgeglichen. Die Kristallgitternatur spielt heute in der Technologie eine gro?e Rolle und wird z .B  in der Radio- und Fernsehtechnik, Lasertechnik und der Computerindustrie zur Speicherung von Informationen genutzt.  Im Krankheitsfall verliert die K?rperzelle ihr Energiepotential und die Abwehrkr?fte gehen gegen Null. Viele Krankheiten und Beschwerden k?nnen durch diese St?rungen ausgel?st werden.Die Wirkung der Edelsteine über die Haut:Die Haut steht st?ndig mit dem vegetative Nervensystem und allen Organen in Verbindung, wobei jedes Hautsegment ganz bestimmten Organen zugeordnet ist. Jede Stimulation auf der Haut, jeder Reiz wird so auf die Organe, das Immunsystem oder das Hormonsystem übertragen. Legt man die Edelsteine auf die Haut, werden die heilenden Strahlen auf die Organe übertragen, die mit dem Hautsegment verbunden sind. Die Reflexe auf der Haut werden blitzschnell zu den entsprechenden Zentren übertragen und bewirken dadurch z.B. eine Schmerzbeseitigung oder einen harmonischen Herzschlag. In gleicher Weise beeinflussen die Edelsteine das Gleichgewicht der K?rpers?fte, den Stoffwechsel, die Hormonregulation, die Nervenleitung und das Immunsystem. Je ?fter Sie Ihren K?rper mit den Heilkr?ften konfrontieren, umso intensiver ist die Wirkung.<br>  Es ist daher besonders empfehlenswert stets einen Edelsteine in Form von Ketten, Ringen, Scheiben, Armb?ndern oder Handsteinen zu tragen, um sich von Anfang an gegen sch?dliche Einwirkungen zu schützen.Die Wirkung der Edelsteine auf die Sinnesorgane:<br>  Die Sinnesorgane sind Fenster und Türen zwischen Innen- und Au?enwelt, weshalb sie auch ausgesprochen empfindlich auf atmosph?rische und kosmische St?rungen reagieren. So ist es auch ganz klar, da? das Hauptanwendungsgebiet der Edelsteine im Bereich der fünf Sinnesorgane liegt, die ausgesprochen stark den Umwelteinflüssen ausgesetzt sind: F?hn, Wetterwechsel, Feuchtigkeit oder Kaltwetterfronten. Die Wirkung der Edelsteine auf die Seele:<br>  Wer auch sonst für sein Leiden noch keine Hilfe gefunden hat, sollte die Hildegardische Edelstein Heilkunde durchsuchen, weil Edelsteine mit Naturkr?ften ausgerüstet sind, die noch tiefer in seelische und geistige Bereiche eindringen k?nnen als alle anderen Medikamente. Gerade auf dem seelisch - geistigen Gebiet finden sich zahlreiche Anwendungen mit Edelsteinen und beweisen, da? die Hildegardische Edelstein Heilkunde eine wichtige praktische Bedeutung hat.Die Wirkung von Edelsteinen mit Gebeten und Worten:Die Anwendung von Gebeten und Edelsteinen er?ffnet eine ganz neue Dimension der Medizin, wie wir es bis hierher noch nie gekannt haben. Durch Gebete werden Edelsteine zum Abwehrmittel vor den negativen Einflüssen des Lebens. Der blaue Chalcedon schützt gegen Alltagsstress und hilft, da? man nicht durch ?rger, Zorn und Gemeinheiten aus der Haut f?hrt. Der Goldtopas mit dem morgendlichen Goldtopas - Gebet stellt unseren Alltag unter den Schutz Gottes und schützt uns vor Unheil und Verletzungen.Der heilende Einflu? von Gebet und Edelstein Heilkunde war für Hildegard selbstverst?ndlich, haben doch die Edelsteine in der Tradition eine gro?e spirituelle Bedeutung. Edelsteine werden bereits im Sch?pfungsbericht und in der Offenbarung erw?hnt. Die Wirkung der Edelsteine auf das Heilungszentrum:<br>  Au?er diesen psychosomatischen Wirkungen, haben die Edelsteine noch einen sehr starken Einflu? auf unser seelisches Kraft- und Heilungszentrum, das in Innern jedes Menschen verborgen ist. Nach Hildegard hat unsere Seele sieben Kr?fte, vier kosmische, die mit dem Universum (Feuer, Luft, Wasser und Erde) verbunden sind und drei g?ttliche Kr?fte. Genau dieselben Kr?fte werden durch die Edelsteinenergie aktiviert. Sobald wir uns bewu?t mit diesem Kraftfeld unserer Seele verbinden, stehen uns explosionsartig ungeahnte Kr?fte zur Verfügung, die uns heilen, regenerieren, vitalisieren und unser Leben ver?ndern k?nnen. Die Transformationskraft, die von jedem Edelstein ausgeht wird auch in der Hildegardischen Psychotherapie zur Transformation negativer Kr?fte in positive Heilkr?fte angewendet. Lesen Sie dazu mehr im gleichnamigen Buch der “Psychotherapie der Hildegard von Bingen”, Lüchow Verlag, Stuttgart, 2004. Goldtopas Gebet der Hl. Hildegard:<br>  “Herr, der Du in allem und von allen verherrlicht wirst. In Deiner gro?en Güte verwerfe mich nicht,sondern erhalte, st?rke und gründe mich auf Deinem Segen.” In Latein:“Deus, qui in omnia et omnibus magnificatus est. In honore suo me non abjiciat, sed in benedictione me conservet, confirmet et constituat.”Mehr Information zu Edelsteine erfahren Sie auf unserer Hildegard-Edelstein-Webseite<br>  www.Hildegard-Edelsteine.de<br>  <br>  Ich lege in jeden Cremtopf einen kleinen Amethysten. :) Das ist gut für die Haut.<br>  <br>   Anne
ef6eb71859d60f5af8c8452de41957f9aa	I break out from just about everything. Do not experiment with natural products just because they are all natural. It doesn't make them good, trust me, and cocoa butter is known to irritate sensitive skin. <br>  <br>  The only products that you should be using for irritated skin, acne or otherwise should be free of any...<br>  <br>  parabens (you know those long words with paraben at the end on ingredient lists? They are preservatives, and they are known allergens). <br>  dyes<br>  perfumes<br>  lanolins <br>  and formaldehyde <br>  <br>  They should read irritant free, and non-comedogenic<br>  <br>  I use Cliniderm products (the only product which didn't cause me to break out) but they are not as moisturizing as I would like so I'm going to try Vanicream, and select Cetaphil products (all which fit my criteria. Still, I had a horrible break out of a red rash on my cheeks and peeling tight skin for the last week. Washing my face with Cliniderm made it go away almost completely overnight!).  All of these products are very very cheap, and highly recommended by dermatologists. <br>  <br>  Also, if you have oily acne you may need to exfoilate, but if your skin is sensitive or irritated it may not be a good idea. <br>  <br>  This site is super useful for additional information and product recommendations (I was just looking there today actually!). Check out the articles, they suggest products and you can check out reviews.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dermadoctor.com/default.asp?WID=%7B05A6B120%2DA82B%2D4BBF%2D8C4C%2DDF0857BDC9EB%7D" rel="nofollow">http://www.dermadoctor.com/default.asp?W...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck, and if you find something that works stick with it! Your skin will get better as it gets used to certain products :)|`|Fjzkf5Apaa	Don't do it! your skin will break out. Use vitamin E capsules.

As far as being arrested, if you are not working now, apply for a public defender, get representation that can help you deal with the situation. If, which you prbably will be, you are released on bail, find a job. It doesn't have to pay top dollar, as you work longer they will see that you are an asset and pay you more. But, with a job, the court is less apt to sending you to jail. Chin up, people will see you for how you see yourself, so adjust your view of yourself. If you need help, turn to a local support group, you are not alone!|`|CnY90BPBaa	cops have a hard job - don't expect them to be fair all the time - don't think so lowly of yourself - you're still better off than alot of ppl - you have a degree for god's sake - I think you need to start off somewhere new - move to a different town or country maybe?|`|YMVZLu3Faa	try god read bible  has all the answers|`|t6xGQxscaa	Honey, It sounds like you are clinically depressed and suicidal. You need to check yourself in the psyche ward. Your thoughts are racing and do not sound logical at all! You are endangering yourself and others without realizing it.  Do it tonite ASAP!<br>  Have you thought that the reason why the cops wanted to arrest you was they are concern for you. Sorry for the tough love but always remember that you are always responsible for your own drama, no one else. When your depressed and in the state of mind that you are in at the present time. One has a tendencies of not thinking rationally and sees' life differently than normal. Seek help. Go to the hospital.

Seriously. No one can tell you what to do in life. No one can live your life for you. You have to find your own answers, and for the time being, let the search for them drive you. I know it isn't a satisfying answer. I know it's not an easy answer. <br>  <br>  I've been through the ringer in many of the same ways you have, and I don't live a good life, but on the hope that some day I may find my bliss, I continue on. Everyone else in that big, scary world? Well, they're just trying to do the same. <br>  <br>  Want some clarity? Unplug the phone and TV and computer. Go to a soup kitchen, and volunteer. Do something that matters for a little while. Visit the elderly. Go to the burn unit at a children's hospital and make some balloon animals, goofy as it sounds, it may become the high point in your week.|`|3rFDS1pLaa	Don't kill yourself...turn yourself in and fix your life.  Jail can be a turning point and it may help you.|`|AA10117642	There is more to this story. Stop feeling sorry for yourself  and get a job using that college degree you have. DO IT NOW! So you don't spend all day in jail. They are more likely to let you out to work or put you on probation. YOU must get a job. Now get in the shower,eat and get your butt out there. You can only save you. There is not a darn thing anyone here or anywhere can do for you!!!!!!!|`|e615419ac7ad11c8a9d71ecf53696f3faa	i'm not goign to give you the speech or anoy u with stuff that won't help one thing u're u and no one selse can be that so just go and make a change leave a leagacy that only u could leafve make a mark on things in youre life show that u did something with u're life and i don't want to bother u but God has never let someone down who trusted in him before and hes not going to start now so make a mark in life and leave a leagacy and pray...it's up to u!!!

I would just say to get on a treadmill everyday with a steep incline of 3.5 to 4.0 for at least 30 minutes. Drastically cut back on sweets, soda, and fatty foods. Eat plenty of fish, ckicken and turkey along with vegetables. No fried foods or fast foods! Drink plenty of water every day. In fact, you should have a glass of water before you eat.

230baf2bff36900a64e9f33068987af9aa	I used to suffer high anxiety, and was stressed out a lot. Anti-depressants helped me a bit along the way, but I found exercising to be very helpful. I'd suggest taking up a form of martial art. It keeps you focused on a goal, and is a very good form of stress relief. From the stretches, to the overall workout itself. And at the end of the day, you can save yourself from less stress by beating down attackers who want to steal your handbag! hehe... hope it helped!|`|09880e38b1f323722ae0e554537199cdaa	Try Meditation|`|890e91725777456c599e83c4ced25ad7aa	YOGA!!

I was a smoker for along time. I quit several times and then started again and again until I was told that I had an abnormal Pap and smoking was a major cause. I swear I won't smoke EVER again! I quit cold turkey and replaced a cigarette with those white and green wintergreen mints for about 2 weeks and that was that. As far as stress goes and being addicted to something else, I would say that you should do something physical swim, play softball, exercise of some form is GREAT to rid your life of stress, I actually signed up for Tae Kwon Do!|`|cHKRZQOAaa	relax. listen to music or read. forget about your stress|`|enDfbJ2Iaa	Not everyone likes excersice but maybe walking to start off with , I have been very stressed too for the last two months <br>  I have been dealing with it through doctor visits as well as a med that he put me on , it has helped me quite a bit and I have also downloaded a hypnosis session from online and use it at bedtime it has really helped me , Stay possitve and remember you are not alone , :O}|`|UNWESnM7aa	Glad to see that your willing to try other stuff then smoking. There's a lot of ways you could deal with stress without smoking. You could go to a gym and work out or work out at home. Play games or watch funny movies. Talk it out with someone you know and can trust. Go outside and scream that helps some people. Hope this helps.
t2tCA32maa	Being a Weight Watcher myself, I can tell you that the Flex Program is a "points-based diet". Think kind of like glorified calorie counting. You are given a number of points, based on things like age, current weight, and height. You can then "spend" those points on any food you choose, with few requirements.<br>  <br>  - You must drink at least 48 oz of water.<br>  - You must consume 2-3 milk servings.<br>  - You must consume 2 t of healthy oils.<br>  - You must consume a total of 5 servings of any combination of fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  * The above do count towards your daily alotted points. <br>  * You are allowed 35 weekly allowance points (points to be used if you go over your daily alottment).<br>  * I have never tried the Core Program.<br>  * I have Currently lost 106 lbs.<br>  <br>  You should definitely check it out.|`|e8bc6430cb02150fa068330518f38015aa	Weight watchers is a method of counting calories, by assigning points to different foods based on their calorie and fiber content.  You get a certain number of points based on your current weight and activity level.<br>  <br>  Good news - it works the same way as counting calories.  You can do the same thing by counting the calories in the activites you do and the food you eat.  Keep that within a healthy range (1200 - 1500 if you don't exercise... 1400+ if you do - depending on activity level), and you can lose weight.|`|AA10846378	They also have a core plan . Your not counting points eating certain foods in moderation. Go to DWLZ.com for a plan.|`|dd7ee887901138e9fac73761c57bcf19aa	Everything is worth points, and you can have a certain amount of points per day. Vegetables are low in points, chocolate is high in points.<br>  <br>  Check out the WeightWatchers website for more info on how to calculate the points (it's based on the energy, fibre, and fat, IIRC)
99c37f598c1c82c68de17784567bf5edaa	There are no ill side effects.|`|AA11622777	Some people do very well when abstaining from sex. I can't see any reason at all NOT to masturbate if you have a desire for it though. It's completely normal and healthy for males and females of both sexes. No side effects, substantial short and long term mental and physical benefits in fact. I get pretty tense if I don't get sexual release (mostly through masturbation) at least every few days. In short I just can't see any reason not to do it...but it's your life. If for any reason (including religion of course) you choose not to do it...that's your choice and your right...and there ain't nothing wrong with it!
rgySzdDMaa	It all depends on what the incense ingredients are. Some Indian incense contains dung and many incense makers use synthetic scents which I believe could be harmful.  The charcoal base of some incense can generate carbon monoxide, so I would at least crack a window open if burning those.<br>  <br>  The natural gums and resins found in better quality incense could have a beneficial effect.

9BFrvDsIaa	L'unico segreto per una buona memoria è l'allenamento. Il nostro cervello funziona proprio come il resto del nostro corpo! Se sta fermo per troppo si arrugginisce e per rinvigorirlo ci vuole un po' di movimento! Per far muovere il nostro cervello basta fare semplici esercizi mnemonici. Ti posso fare qualche esempio : ricordare delle parole particolari ma non complicate per tutta la giornata, sforzarsi di ricordare numeri di telefono di amici e parenti, indirizzi o date importanti aiuta moltissimo!!! Oppure sforzarsidi ricordare ciò che si è mangiato la sera prima! O la notizia più interessante del telegiornale del giorno prima! Tutto ciò aiuta moltissimo. Oppure: puoi farti scrivere su un foglietto da qualche amico una lista di 30 parole che rimangono comunque corte (non più di 4-5 lettere per parola) e poi darti 2minuti di tempo per cercare di memorizzarle. Scaduti questi 2 minuti, togli via il foglietto e scrivi su un altro foglio quante più parole riesci a ricordare per non più di 3 minuti. Fare spesso questo esercizio aiuta la memoria istantanea, molto utile in qualsiasi tipo di lavoro, così come a scuola quando si cerca di prendere appunti ma a volte si è troppo lenti nello scrivere e non ci si ricorda + della frase appena finita dal professore. Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto!<br>  Comunque certe persone sono più predisposte di altri ad avere una buona memoria, fatto sta però che anche le persone più brillanti, se non stimolano per tanto il cervello, anche se prima avevano una memoria ferrea si ritrovano con la ruggine. Mestieri come il cameriere che necessitano di una buona memoria per le ordinazioni non hanno bisogno di gente con queste qualità già inserite nel dna, ma di persone sveglie che non si impigriscano mentalemnte!|`|2s4TBjroaa	io credo sia una capacità innata,poi sicuramente ci sono metodi per affinarla e stimolarla.... ma sinceramente non ne conosco....nel frattempo..hai provato a scriverti dei promemoria? così ti aiuti a non dimenticare le cose importanti..|`|cb17b9848dedd2307399ac86f136d040aa	Ciao!<br>  I meccanismi della memoria devono essere allenati tantissimo, infatti, solo così possiamo potenziare la nostra capacità di apprendimento, ricordando tutto e tutti.

Basically it depends on what retainer you are fitted with. If it is a fixed one it will non removable. If it is a removable one typically you are expected to wear it all the time for the first six months (except for when eating and brushing your teeth of course), and then you will be expected to wear it only at night for the rest of your life. However you could probably just get away with wearing every other night after about a year.<br>  <br>  Some people will tell you they never wore their retainer and their teeth never moved back, however many people do experience some movement if they do not follow their orthodontist's instructions with regards to the wearing of their retainer, thus I suggest you wear your retainer as instructed - you don't want to be undoing the work the braces have done.<br>  <br>  As the name suggests a retainer's purpose is to retain the teeth in their new position.|`|8711089f215b5e62650e429925e1e3d5aa	The retainer stays in until all affected teeth are properly positioned, to the dentists standards, of your mouth.

That's only because there's a muscle between my 2 front teeth that keeps trying to push the gap back open.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it depends solely on your teeth.  If they were in bad condition before you had the braces put on, then you may have to wear your retainer for about a year or two.|`|xxycZ9Cxaa	well you normally have to were them for 3-6months all day every day but after that then its about 6months just at night but dont forget every bodys different so you may have to wear it for longer or shorter, <br>  but if i was you i wud just ask ur dentist becos ther the 1 that shud deffantly know.<br>  <br>  good look and everything shud go ok :)|`|0aKlDHdfaa	The honest answer is....if you want your teeth to stay exactly as they are now...a minimum of alternate nights forever!  If you have bonded-on retainers they need to be regularly checked by a dentist, because if they de-bond then your teeth will begin to move towards their orginal position. You have a beautiful smile now - look after it!

I do three sets of 6-8 each, but my trainer does 5 sets of 5.<br>  <br>  Don't do the same exercise on consecutive days.<br>  <br>  Next, eat better.

You don't need to go into excess, but make sure your protein is healthy, i.e., chicken, turkey, eggs.  Nothing breaded or fried.<br>  <br>  Cut out fats and sugars as much as possible.<br>  <br>  You have to eat more calories than you burn - you won't build muscle if you're losing weight.

As for exercise you should do cardio at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes.  Do away with lots of starches, fats and sugars and that should help too.|`|IDJXbjsdaa	if you want to lose it in 3 weeks the fastest way is medifast my  first 10 days on it lost 10lbs|`|AA10744085	I know you said no pills, but...<br>  I was not looking to lose weight.

To lose the weight i keep track of what i eat and keep my caloric intake between 1200 and 1400 cals a day (this is recommended by numerous articles from mags such as "fitness") I use fitday.com to keep track and it is wonderful, a great tool because not only does it keep track of calories but nutrient intake and caloriesburned vs. calories eaten! In the morning i stick to oatmeal or a luna sunrise bar or and eggwhite omelet with veggies but no cheese or very little cheese. lunch i go with soup and salad, for dinner it depends . i keep to 2 snacks a day between 100 and 130 calories each. Also i take in very little or no calories from drinks, always stick with water because it is wonderful for you :)  after using fitday for a couple of days you will be able to see where you can cut calories or add them. as for excericise i go to gym daily (not usually on weekends) for between a 1/2 hour on the eliptical or an hour on the stationary bike or 20 minutes on each... i also run on the treadmill but thats just recently after i've built up muscle and lost weight. i also do some crunches and leg lifts and some dips and pushups to keep muscles toned. i really hope this helps. Good Luck!

One of those jobs was a manager at McDonald's.  As a manager you get unlimited free food so I was eating McDonald's 7 times per week.  And I'm talking like Big Macs not salads.

Get to a doctor now. If your research led you to believe it was anemia, how about checking out the 10 Warning Signs of Depression? I think that one is likely.

If there is, then stop taking the pill immediately and call a doctor for a test, or go buy one. This sounds like pregnancy symptoms, and the pill doesn't always stop you from getting pregnant. I was on it for a few years, and I got pregnant. If you think you could be, then stop the pill just incase. If not, then you should still call a doctor, the pill could be messing with your system. Goodluck :)|`|c1f68c6c3c26401f22582c953fa40ee9aa	You'll never know if it's a "bad" batch of birth control pills because some women get these symptoms from the pill...

It is a way of life for me...The plan I describe below will not only lose you weight, but it will cut out the bloating which is a whole bunch of inches on your waste line. I lost 5 inches in the first month. I went from a 42 to a tight 36 in the first 4 weeks. (All boating was gone in the first two weeks) Remember that I have cut out almost all meat and eat mostly raw fruits and veg. Only sushi once a week, and I started the first week with a 7 day juice fast (see your doctor for advise). On my Juice fast I took in a max of 1200 calories a day for the first week. 200 cals of those was a balanced protein shake by Boost to make sure i was getting all the vits and minerals. (and a multi vit)<br>  <br>  Cut out 500 to 750 calories a day from the recommended values below, while either not cutting the nutrition, or cutting it as little as possible. Do this by eating nutritionally dense foods. You will lose it in not time. I also recommend juice fasting one day a week. That will cut out a 1000 calories on that day if you drink the right juices. It will also let your digestive system rest for that day and you will lose bloating that is so common in our bodies nowadays. Friday is my day. I call it fasting Fridays and I celebrate day because on that day I stand up and say "I have control over food. it does not control me!" (and I tell everyone!)<br>  <br>  On a 2000 calorie diet (women) 2500 (men) 50 to 60 grams. These should be mostly veg/fruit protein. I would recommend only a max of 10 from lean meat. The average person should get 50g protein and 300g carbs. As an example rice has 10g protein and 44g carbs. If you ate 1 to 2 cups of rice a day with broccoli and olive oil you would have roughly 40% of a healthy diet. The key to losing weight is getting to the numbers grams you need with the minimum calories. Eat nutritionally dense food like rice and stay away from food that have alot of calories, but are low in the grams of protein, good carbs, and good fats. Here is the rule of thumb if it grows on the ground, or walks on the ground, or swims... It is good! If not... Don't put it in your mouth. Ever seen a bread tree??? Here is the amendment to the rule. If it has a face... Eat it sparingly. The Chinese are on average fit and trim, have low diabetes and heart disease, and take in a small fraction of the animal protein that an average American does. (That means milk, butter and cheese too) ((I would not put butter or milk in my body under any circumstance. It would be better to eat steak once a month.))|`|329e2490c6543f158387e040bdd8d5f7aa	You know what ?<br>  <br>  DO the LOW CARB DIET !!!<br>  <br>  It's awesome !!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I lost over 30 pounds in 6 weeks !!!<br>  <br>  You also need to do some exercise..  but the diet by itself, its great !!!|`|4UzebzeIaa	take 2 or 3 glass of water in the morning without brushing ur teeth and while u r going to sleep in the night take one glass of luke water add one tea spoon Honey and one lime it helps to reduce ur fat . do not eat junk   food.|`|b633b28d3b4bb03bf27c7f1a2219d912aa	SLIm QUICk|`|9f2d8382b206654443574bbab1159e61aa	Agreed you are large male, but what species do you belong to ! oh that was a lightener, anyways all the best for your fat reduction programme and go to www.burnyourfat.com Hope that helps !|`|uiJLWRWBaa	Just try eating less its not that hardest thing to do, also running alot helps especially if you find someone to run with it will make you dedicated to do it more often.|`|jR5kvXgeaa	find calorie/fitness calculator on the net, enter all your stats and it will tell you how many calories you need a day to maintain, take off 300-400cal off that number and thats how much you need to lose.<br>  eat 5-6 small meals a day (eat every 2-3 hours)<br>  5-8 servings of fruit and veggies a day<br>  8 glasses of water<br>  have complex carbs for breakfast - they give you energy<br>  have lean meat (protein) for dinner - repairs muscle<br>  cardio exercise 4-6 times a week for 30-50min, light weight training<br>  dont consume foods that are made of white flour (white bread, cakes, past etc.), sugar loaded foods (cookies, icecream, candy etc) and nothing fried, oily.<br>  ofcourse you can spoil yourself once in a while with a little treat:)|`|wLLO2k91aa	Try cleansing I just got done doing a cleanse with my husband and I lost 13 pounds in 9 days and I have never felt better.

Getting to a doctor as soon as possible will be very beneficial to you. As I am sure you already know, Grave's Disease can take years to get under control, and alot of hell is suffered from this disease. As far as foods doing this to you, alot of reading I have done today lends towards food allergies causing alot of symptoms, if not the actual autoimmune response. Try to stay away from all additives and preservatiaves. Cut out iodine, wheat and soy., caffeine, chocolate and tea. No soda, and alot of research is suggesting Aspartame poisoning may also contribute. To be safe, cut that out also. Keep a diary of how you feel each day, and what you ate. Try to find a relationship between the two. I am not sure if it works or not, but today is the first day I am trying it. I can not go on like this anymore, and the medical community as a whole is still pretty much in the dark in terms of this disease and causes.<br>  Good Luck. My daily journal is viewable online at www.myspace.com/thereisonly1earth. The Grave's disease blog I hope will be helpfull for anyone suffering from this horrible disease.

There are so many other things I need to get done, but hours later I am still on-line playing games.<br>  <br>  1.  One technique that works for me is to set an alarm clock, or "timer" (I use the one on my stove, it's really really loud and doesn't turn off until five minutes later).<br>  <br>  The alarm clock has to be in another room so you have to get up from your computer and go turn it off.

Another thing I do is if I reach a point where I'm disgusted with myself for wasting so much time, I will try to immediately, without thinking about it in a split-second,  turn off my computer on the "power surge outlet", even when I'm on-line....my whole computer is turned off.  Actively having to restart it, go back on-line, etc....takes time and I usually just leave it off and go into another room.<br>  <br>  These are the only ways I know to stop myself playing games for hours on end.<br>  <br>  I hope other answers to this question will help me, too.

60e09b8e9dde9e0c4a2b904af5c3892faa	Creatine has been a great hit in the gyms. It is probably one of the most effective and most used nutrients available, there are literally hundreds of studies to show that creatine will help you build muscle quicker; get stronger and give your muscles a fuller, more "pumped" look. When you combine it with HMB, a compound found naturally in meat (though you'll need to eat around six pounds of meat every day to get enough) the results are really more impressive. <br>  <br>  HMB is a very powerful anti-catabolic ingredient. What does this mean? Your muscles grow by a circular process of synthesising and breaking down proteins. If you want bigger, stronger muscles, you need to alter this cycle. That means either speeding up synthesis (anabolism) and/or slowing the rate of breakdown (catabolism). Muscle growth is the balance between the amount of protein your body makes and the amount it breaks down. Creatine is highly anabolic, while HMB is a powerful anti-catabolic. That's why HMB and creatine are the perfect combination for anyone who wants to pack on muscle without gaining fat.|`|AA10120788	Man whatever u do don't get messed up on steroids!!|`|AA10846378	You will lose body fat and develop your muscle.

When they had to face the facts at the end of they day, they couldn't do anything about it, because they cant face the truth, so they ignore it and go on pointing the finger, thinking its ''fun'' to rip someone to shreds because of their weight.

Aber da ich nicht gern Obst und Gemüse esse, und das Punktez?hlen zu mühsam war, habe ich mich für Trennkost entschieden. Ist relativ einfach zu handhaben. Ich konnte essen, was ich wollte, nur entsprechend getrennt. Innerhalb von 10 Wochen hatte ich 12 Kilo abgenommen und halte seit einem halben Jahr mein Gewicht. <br>  <br>  Auf die Idee war ich gekommen, weil ich beim MDR eine Art "Wettkampf" gesehen hatte, wo drei Gruppen gegeneinander antraten: 1. Gruppe Weight Watchers, 2. Gruppe Trennkost, 3. Gruppe nur Sport. Und tats?chlich hatte die Gruppe mit der Trennkost das Meiste abgespeckt. Allerdings glaube ich nicht, dass es so gesund wie Weight Watchers ist. Also wenn Du gern Obst und Gemüse isst, würde ich Dir das eher empfehlen. Und in einer Gruppe kann man sich auch gegenseitig motivieren.|`|naibCjL8aa	Hy ich kenne dein Problem mir gehts genaus wie dir! Ich bin 19 und auch übergewichtig und komm beim joggen auch immer voll aus der pust und deshalb kann ich dir raten nordic walking zu betreiben es sieht zwar etwas l?cherlich aus aber es schont die gelenke und man kann so seine ausdauer steigern au?erdem ist es wichtig beim abnehmen viel wasser zu trinken und abnehmen kann man immer besser so zweit da man dann mehr ansporn hat wenn du willst kannst du mir ja mal schreiben und wir k?nnen uns zum thema abnehmen austauschen|`|oSKVs1Pgaa	Was das abnehmen angeht bin ich ebenfalls ein Fan von Weightwatchers. Vielleicht findest Du irgendwo ein Treffen in Deiner N?he? Bis dahin versuche auf jeden Fall viel Gemüse und Obst in Deine Ern?hrung einzubauen, Vollkornprodukte und, ebenfalls sehr wichtig, viel trinken. 2 Liter Wasser am Tag sollten es schon sein. Und verkneife Dir nicht alles Sü?e, aber rationiere es. Wenn Du Dir vornimmst, nie wieder Schokolade zu naschen, bekommst Du sonst irgendwann irren Hei?hunger darauf. 15 - 20 kg in einem Jahr ist übrigens ein gutes Ziel, das sollte zu schaffen sein :-)<br>  <br>  Was das joggen angeht ist es erst einmal gaaaaanz wichtig, langsam laufen. Wirklich langsam, selbst wenn Du das Gefühl hast, jede Schnecke würde Dich überholen. Die Schnelligkeit kommt sp?ter von allein, Du mu?t erst einmal Ausdauer aufbauen. Und Du mu?t am Anfang auch keine 30 Minuten am Stück schaffen. Eine gute M?glichkeit ist es, in der ersten Woche zwei Minuten zu joggen, zwei Minuten zu gehen. Wenn das klappt, in der zweiten Woche drei Minuten joggen, zwei Minuten gehen. Die Woche darauf dann 5 Minuten joggen, eine Minute gehen und so ganz langsam steigern.<br>  <br>  Au?erdem solltest Du nicht jeden Tag laufen. Die Muskulatur ben?tigt etwa 48 Stunden um sich zu regenerieren, und wenn Du zu oft l?ufst, l?ufst Du Gefahr, ins übertraining zu kommen. Laufe am besten nur jeden 2. Tag, also 3 oder 4 mal die Woche. <br>  <br>  Wenn Du ein gutes Buch zu dem Thema suchst: Meine pers?nliche Bibel ist von Winni Mühlbauer "So einfach ist laufen". Das Buch geht au?erdem auf eine ganze Menge Ern?hrungsfragen ein. <br>  <br>  Viel Glück!|`|zTwdC3xoaa	sch?nen guten abend!<br>  <br>  ich hoffe ich kann dir etwas weiter helfen! zum thema jogging würde ich dir raten es einmal mit intervalltraining zu probieren. es ist sehr viel efizeinter und ist nicht so zeit aufwendig. efizienter weil es einen h?heren nachbrennevekt hat, das hei?t der stoffwechsel wird starker angekurbelt und verbrennt l?nger fett als bei ausdauertraining mit niedriger herzfrequenz. intervalltraining wird in denn mei?ten fitnessstudios angeboten, der kurs in meinem dauert 20min und sieht wie folgt aus: spinning... 4min auf leichter stufe erw?rmen, jeweils 8sprints bei max. schwierigkeitsstufe und geschwindigkeit 30sek lang und immer 60sek erholundsphase dazwischen auf leichter stufe mit normaler geschwindigkeit. und zum schlu? 4min abw?rmen.. sehr hart am anfang, aber man gew?hn sich an alles :-) zur ern?hrung kann ich nur sagen, wenig kohlehydrate, abends nur eiwei? und ballaststoffe, und FDH!!!<br>  <br>  viel erfolg!!!

Nv6M3wpOaa	Il pranic healing wave dovrebbe essere una nuova terapia considerata l'evoluzione della pranoterapia classica e del pranic healing. <br>  Questa terapia innovativa è stata sviluppata in italia e presenta come vantaggi un'enorme amplificazione della potenza terapeutica rispetto alle altre e una diagnosi rapidissima del problema psichico o fisico grazie ad una lettura sensitiva del corpo pranico. Per ora è una tecnica che sono in pochi a praticare per la ovvia difficoltà a gestire un simile dispendio energetico.

Le persone che la praticano sono veramente dsponibili e sincere e riescono ad analizzare e focalizzare  in una seduta la causa della tua sofferenza. Nella seduta successiva viene effettuato il trattamento specifico sulla parte in questione e mentre avviene questo vengono fuori tutti i blocchi emozionali, con spiegazione del tipo di blocco. Io ho pianto dall'inizio alla fine e quando sono uscita ero una persona nuova.
d7df9c973cd87ce21b12d0dbf2091e95aa	You need to see a QUALIFIED Urologist. Although there are different causes (virtually all can  be remedied) my bet is you lack enough skin on the underside of your penis so when you become erect the taught skin pulls it downward.  You should be referred to a plastic/reconstructive surgeon who will then do a very quick outpatient procedure and solve your problem.  Yes, this can make intercourse awkward to impossible and even cause pain, not to mention embarrasment for you in the process.  This condition is not that rare, although there are varying degrees of severity.  If it hinders your physical function and/or personal well being then it needs to be addressed.|`|b24d6ee68cd4ca4b5f0363975690667baa	I don't understand.

gNSwiFo7aa	Yes there is and it is Thermonex which has a very unique ingredient profile which separates it from any other thermogenic formula on the market. Thermonex was also designed to attack fat loss from multiple pathways, which many fat burners don't offer. Taking this you will not experience any crashing or irritability.It also icrease your metabolic rate and burn calories (Even When You Are Not Exercising)! How amazing!

However I have recently heard of a new drug that has just been made 'over the counter' called Alli.  It works by absorbing fat in your intestines before it is absorbed into the bloodstream.  The only side effect is diarrhea.  I heard this on CNN.
mlFADPOYaa	Yes, of course it's possible with HOT-ROX! Ramps up lipolysis, releasing fat from adipocytes more rapidly than ephedra-based products to the point of no contest and unlike ephedra-based formulas, it's safe and it doesn't down-regulate beta-receptor sites and become ineffective over time. Maximizes and sustains metabolism around the clock, turning fat into heat energy, through two powerful mechanisms: Fueling the TCA cycle stimulating mitochondrial uncoupling. First of all, it's far more effective at burning off body fat than anything that's ever been on the market.|`|a84a7799f01d775d961e01defa85cc29aa	The closest thing to what you want is having lots of lean muscle mass.

119fb22585f57c62ecc7e230c6abbc25aa	myfoodpyramid.org is a government sponsored site that allows you to input all the food, vitamins, exercise you do each day and tells you what you are lacking. As long as there is a refrigerator where you live, it should be relatively easy to ween off the fast food. Pick one day per week (or weekend) when you have time and make food for the whole week. The biggest excuse for fast food is no time to prepare good food. You obviously have the will power to study and do well to stay in school. Try to apply some of that will power to your daily eating habits. Also start taking a multi-vitamin daily if you do not already. This contains many nutrients important for a woman's body now and as a preventative for the future.

NLN9JmrMaa	If it was blown (or ruptured) due to infection, there would be ear pain, difficulty hearing and yellowish, pus type drainage. Ruptures require antibiotics and the Dr. needs to check to make sure it heals itself or it may require surgical repair.|`|pshFiWrmaa	When I ruptured my eardrum it hurt very very badly. First it started bleeding and I was sitting up and someone told me my ear was filling up with blood. After it stopped bleeding yellowish puss started coming out of it. Also if you have ever had tubes put in your ear they may come out. I know mine did when my eardrum ruptured. Also I remember having ringing in my ear. But if there is no blood or yellow stuff coming out of it I doubt you have ruptured or blown it. Good luck, if your still questioning it after this it can never hurt to go to the doctor just to make sure.

AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  <br>  <br>  Also start counting your calories.  Write them down.  You would be amazed as to how much more aware you are of your caloric intake, if you actually write it down.  We recently discovered a site that offers a great program that counts calories, as well as keeps track of everything.  It allows multiple users, so everyone in the family can keep track.  They offer a free 7 day trial, and so far I am very impressed with the product.  Try the 7 days and see.  It allows you to add the exercise that you do during the day, which increases the amount of calories you can take in.  Very Cool!!<br>  <a href="http://www.calorieking.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieking.com</a><br>  <br>  A sight with some really cool diet calculators and interesting calorie counting calculators is here.

Women die from eating disorders EVERYDAY.|`|ae8b9a9964c794e772d6aae25d7c2c17aa	What are the signs and symptoms of bulimia?<br>  <br>  People who have bulimia are very secretive about their bingeing and purging, so others may not notice the signs and symptoms of the eating disorder. Some symptoms of bulimia are so subtle that only a medical professional would notice them. Surprisingly, being underweight is not a characteristic sign of bulimia, even though people with bulimia are afraid of being too fat. Individuals with bulimia often are of normal weight or overweight because they eat a lot. <br>  The warning signs and symptoms of bulimia include:<br>  <br>  Secrecy surrounding eating and the time period after eating, to allow for bingeing and then purging. Frequent trips to the bathroom after meals, signs and/or smells of vomiting, evidence of laxatives or diuretics. Going to the kitchen after everyone else has gone to bed to binge. Going for unexpected walks or drives at night. Excessive desire for privacy in the bedroom or bathroom. <br>  Odd eating behaviors, such as avoidance of eating with others; unpredictable and sudden dietary likes and dislikes; skipping of meals; taking very small portions when eating with others; consuming a lot of water or diet soda (to make vomiting easier); cutting food into very small bites; chewing food excessively; separating different types of food on the plate; strange pairings of foods. <br>  Eating unusually large amounts of food, with no apparent change in weight. The disappearance of large amounts of food, or numerous empty wrappers or containers in the garbage. <br>  Excessive, rigid exercise regimen – However, it is difficult to distinguish a serious athlete from an athlete with bulimia. Both may train excessively and not eat enough to compensate for the caloric usage <br>  Complex lifestyle schedules or rituals to make time for binge-and-purge sessions.

Diverso però  è il caso della serotonina. Infatti non esistono prove scientifiche in merito, si tratta solo di un'ipotesi. Leggendo quanto segue te ne renderai conto, anche se questa ipotesi viene ormai considerata verità. <br>  L'ipotesi della Serotonina<br>  <br>  Nel 1965 Joseph Schildkraut ha portato avanti l'ipotesi che la depressione fosse associata con i bassi livelli di norepinephrine [6], e in seguito i ricercatori hanno teorizzato che il neurotrasmettitore d'interesse fosse la serotonina [7]. Negli anni seguenti vi furono numerosi tentativi di identificare alterazioni neurochimiche riproducibili nel sistema nervoso di pazienti con diagnosi di depressione. Per esempio i ricercatori confrontarono i livelli di metaboilti sella serotonina nei fluidi celebrospinali di pazienti suicidi clinicamente depressi con quelli di un campione di controllo, ma la letteratura iniziale è stata rimescolata e plagiata con difficoltà metodologiche come la dimensione molto piccola dei campioni e per variabili non controllate che non che confondono. In una recente revisione di questi studi il presidente del Consiglio Medico Tedesco, e i suoi colleghi hanno detto “ le associazioni riportate di sottogruppi con comportamenti suicidiari (come tentativi violenti di suicido) con la bassa concentrazione di CSF-5HIAA [serotonina] sembrano rappresentare una qualche traslazione prematura di quello trovato dagli studi che hanno pecche nella metodologia” [8]. Furono anche fatti dei tentativi di indurre la depressione producendo un abbassamento dei livelli della serotonina, ma questi esperimenti non hanno accumulato alcun risultato consistente [9]. Similmente i ricercatori trovarono che un forte incremento di serotonina, a cui si giungeva con la somministrazione di una forte dose di L-tryptophan, erano inefficaci nel diminuire la depressione [10].<br>  <br>  Ogni prova fatta dai ricercatori in questa epoca è fallita nel tentare di confermare una lesione serotinergica in un qualsiasi disturbo mentale e anzi hanno fornito prove significative contro la spiegazione di una semplice carenza di un neurotrasmettitore. La moderna neuroscienza ha invece mostrato che il cervello è enormemente complesso e malamente compreso [11]. Anche se le neuroscienze sono un settore in rapido sviluppo, proporre che i ricercatori possano obiettivamente identificare uno “sbilanciamento chimico” a livello molecolare non è compatibile con il livello dell'attuale scienza. In effetti non esiste neppure un livello scientificamente stabilito come ideale per il “bilanciamento chimico”, rendendo pertanto impossibile l'identificazione di un di uno sbilanciamento patologico. Equiparare l'impressionante recente avanzamento delle neuroscienze con l'appoggio dell'ipotesi della serotonina è un errore.<br>  <br>  Mancando prove dirette della mancanza di serotonina in ogni disordine mentale, la vanta efficacia dei farmaci SSRI è spesso utilizzata come prova indiretta dell'ipotesi della serotonina. Tuttavia questo è un modo di ragionare ex juvantibus (cioé di ragionare al contrario per fare assunzioni sulle cause della malattia basandosi sulla risposta ai trattamenti della malattia) è problematico dal punto di vista logico. Per esempio il fatto che l'aspirina curi il mal di testa non prova che il mal di testa sia causato da bassi livelli di aspirina nel cervello. I ricercatori nell'ambito della serotonina del US National Institute of Mental Health Laboratory of Clinical Science hanno detto chiaramente “la dimostrata efficacia degli inebitori selettivi della recaptazione della serotonina ... non può essere utilizzata come prova primaria che la disfunzione sia serotinergica nello studio della patofisiologia di questi disturbi” [12].<br>  <br>  Pertanto il ragionamento all'indietro e partire dall'efficacia degli SSRI per presumere la carenza di serotonina, è fortemente contestato. La validità di questo ragionamento diventa sempre meno plausibile quando si considerano i recenti studi che arrivano anche a dubitare dell'efficacia dei farmaci SSRI. Irving Kirsch e i suoi colleghi utilizzando il Freedom of Information Act, ha ottenuto l'accesso a tutti i dati dei test clinici sugli antidepressivi inviati alla Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dalle case farmaceutiche per l'approvazione medica. Quando sono stati ottenuti i dati sia delle prove pubblicate sia di quelle non pubblicate si è che il placebo duplicava circa l'80% della risposta dell'antidepressivo [13]; Nel 57% dei casi di questi studi finanziati dalle casi produttrici non si è riusciti a mostrare una differenza statisticamente significativa tra l'antidepressivo e il placebo inerte [14]. Una recente rassegna di Cochrane suggerisce che questi risultati sono gonfiati rispetto a quelli che utilizzano un placebo attivo [15]. Nel caso di trattamenti di altri squilibri ben studiati, come nel caso della carenza dell'insulina, non si nota un efficacia così modesta e un tasso di risposta così estremamente alto del placebo. Questo pone dei seri dubbi sulla validità dell'ipotesi della serotonina.<br>  <br>  Risulta anche problematico per l'ipotesi della serotonina il continuo aumento di ricerche che paragonano gli effetti dei farmaci SSRI con quelli di altri trattamenti che non hanno come obbiettivo specifico la serotonina. Per esempio in una rassegna sistematica di Cochrane non ha trovato nessuna differenza significativa tra l'efficacia dei farmaci antidepressivi SSRI e quella dei farmaci antidepressivi triciclici [16]. In oltre, in prove random controllate, il buproprion [17] e la reboxetine [18] si sono mostrate efficaci esattamente come i farmaci SSRI nel trattamento della depressione, anche se non hanno alcun effetto, a un livello significativo, sulla serotonina. Gli effetti ottenuti in recenti studi randomizzati e controllati hanno mostrato che i risultati ottenuti con estratti della pianta iperico [19] e con dei placebi [20] sono superiori di quelli ottenuti con in farmaci SSRI. L'esercizio si è rivelato utile quanto il farmaco SSRI sertraline in uno studio randomizzato controllato [21]. Le ricerche e le attivit6agrave; di sviluppo delle case farmaceutiche mostrano inoltre una diminuzione del ruolo dato all'intervento con serotinonergici. La Eli Lilly, la casa che produce la fluoxetina (Prozac), ha recentemente messo in commercio la duloxetine, un antidepressivo studiato per interagire oltre con la serotonina anche con norepinephrine. Le prove presentate su ciò sembrano incompatibili con una lesione specifica serotinergica nella depressione.<br>  <br>  Anche se i farmaci SSRI sono considerati degli "antidepressivi", in realtà sono approvati dalla FDA come terapia per 8 distinte tipi di diagnosi psichiatriche, che variano dai disordini d'ansia sociale al disordine ossessivo compulsivo al disordine disforico premestruale. Alcune pubblicità dirette ai consumatori (come quelle sui siti web dello Zoloft e del Paxil) promuovono l'ipotesi della serotonina non solo per la depressione, ma anche per alcune di queste altre categorie. [22,23]. Pertanto, affinché l'ipotesi della serotonina si corretta come attualmente presentata, la regolazione della serotonina dovrebbe essere la causa (ed il rimedio) di ognuno di questi tipi di disordini [24]. Questa cosa è improbabile e nessuno ha finora proposto una teoria convincente che spieghi come un singola anormalità neurochimica possa produrre un così vasto numero di manifestazioni nel comportamento.<br>  <br>  In breve, non esiste una prova rigorosa a favore della la teoria della serotonina ed invece presente un significativo gruppo di prove contraddittorie. Lontano da essere una linea radicale di pensiero, i dubbi sulla ipotesi della serotonina sono ben riconosciuti da molti ricercatori, compreso alcune discorsi schietti da parte di alcuni famosi psichiatri, alcuni dei quali sono anche degli entusiastici proponenti della medicalizzazione con farmaci SSRI (vedi Tabella 1).<br>  <br>  Tuttavia, in aggiunta a quello che questi autori hanno detto a proposito della serotonina, è anche importante guardare a cosa la serotonina non è detto nella letteratura scientifica. A quanto ne sappiamo non vi è neanche un un singolo articolo sottoposto a peer-reviewed che possa essere accuratamente citato a sostegno delle affermazioni secondo cui ci sia una carenza di serotonina in un qualsiasi disordine mentale, mentre ci sono parecchi articoli che presentano prove dell'opposto. Inoltre il Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), che è pubblicato dalla American Psychiatric Association e che contiene le definizioni di tutte le diagnosi psichiatriche, non elenca la serotonina come causa di alcun disturbo mentale. Il libro di testo della psichiatria clinica (American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry) si riferisce all'ipotesi della carenza della serotonina come ad un'ipotesi non confermata, affermando che “ulteriori prove non hanno confermato l'ipotesi dell'abbassamento delle monoammine.<br>  Pubblicità ai consumatori di antidepressivi<br>  <br>  Contrariamente a quello che la gente di solito crede, la FDA non richiede un'approvazione preventiva della pubblicità. Invece la FDA tiene d'occhio cosa ci è scritto sulla pubblicità soltanto dopo che sono state stampate o che sono state trasmesse [26]. Succede abbastanza frequentemente che all'interno delle campagne pubblicitarie dirette ai consumatori si trovino delle informazioni fuorvianti [27]; Pertanto è molto utile confrontare le pubblicità dei farmaci SSRI con le prove scientifiche di cui si è parlato qui sopra. Queste pubblicità dei farmaci vengono diffuse molto largamente; centinaia di milioni di dollari sono stati spesi per diffondere ampliamente queste pubblicità e uno studio ha mostrato che più del 70% dei pazienti intervistati è risultato esposto alle campagne di pubblicità diretta al pubblico sugli antidepressivi. [28].<br>  <br>  Il ruolo dell'FDA<br>  <br>  Negli Stati Uniti d'America la FDA controlla e regola le pubblicità dirette ai consumatori. La FDA richiede che le pubblicità “non sia falsa o forviante”e che “le informazioni presenti devono non essere inconsistenti con il foglietto informativo del prodotto” [27]. Le case farmaceutiche che diffondano pubblicità non compatibili con queste richieste possono ricevere lettere di avvertimento dalla FDA ed essere sanzionate. L'equivalente Irlandese della FDA, la Commissione Medica Irlandese, recentemente ha vietato alla GlaxoSmithKline di affermare che la paroxetine corregge uno sbilanciamento chimico perfino nei foglietti informativi dati ai pazienti con il farmaco. [29]. Deve la FDA prendere un iniziativa simile contro le pubblicità dei farmaci SSRI?<br>  <br>  Ad esempio, le informazioni sulla prescrizione della paroxetine, che è un tipico farmaco della classe SSRI, affermano che “L'efficacia della paroxetine nel trattamento del disturbo depressivo maggiore, del disordine di ansia sociale, del disordine ossessivo compulsivo, del disordine da panico, dal disordine da ansia generico e dal disordine da stress post-traumatico è presunta essere legata al potenziamento dell'attività serotonergica nel sistema nervoso centrale risultante dall'inibizione della ricattura neuronale della serotonina. Studi a dosi clinicamente rivelanti negli umani hanno dimostrato che la pasoxetine blocca il recupero della serotonina nelle piastrine degli umani.” [30].<br>  <br>  In altre parole, il meccanismo di azione della paroxetine non mai stato definitivamente stabilito e rimane non confermato e si tratta solo di un'ipotesi (le informazioni sulla prescrizione affermano che il l'efficacia del farmaco “è presunta essere legata al potenziamento dell'attivit6agrave; serotinergica“ ([30], enfasi aggiunta). Sebbene ci siano delle prove che la paroxetine inebisca la recaptazione della serotonina, non è il significato di questo fenomeno nel miglioramento dei sintomi psichiatrici e tuttora dibattuto [12, 31]. Più importante ancora, le informazioni sulla prescrizione non menzionano una carenza di serotonina nelle persone a cui viene somministrata la paroxetine né afferma che la paroxetine corregge lo sbilanciamento della serotonina. Al contrario le pubblicità rivolte ai consumatori sulla paroxetina cointengono affermazioni che non si trovano nei foglietti informativi del prodotto approvati dalla FDA.<br>  <br>  In modo da determinare se le pubblicità veramente rispettano le regole della FDA, è utile consultare il codice delle regole federali Le regole dicono che una pubblicità può, essere ritenuta falsa o fuorviante se “contiene affermazioni a riguardo del meccanismo o del luogo di funzionamento del principio attivo che non sono generalmente considerate come stabilite per vere tramite prove scientifiche da esperti qualificati da un'istruzione scientifica e dall'esperienza senza rivelare che le affermazioni non sono ben stabilite come vere e le limitazioni che hanno le prove portate” ([32], (enfasi aggiunta).<br>  <br>  Sembra che sia ammesso affermare che la depressione possa essere dovuta ad una carenza della serotonina, ma, come prescritto dalle regole, soltanto se vengono enunciate le limitazioni che hanno le prove utilizzate a sostegno di tale ipotesi. Nel nostro esame delle pubblicità dei farmaci SSRI, non abbiamo trovato neanche una pubblicità che avesse tale informazione. Al contrario l'ipotesi della serotonina è in genere presentata come una credenza diffusa nella comunità scientifiica, come nel caso della pubblicità dello Zoloft, che afferma a proposito della depressione che “gli scienziati credono che possa essere collegata ad uno sbilanciamento chimico di una sostanza chimica chiamata serotonina.” [33]. I consumatori che vedano questa pubblicità rimangono non informati riguardo le limitazione dell'ipotesi della serotonina (di cui è stata fatta una breve rassegna più sopra).<br>  <br>  Inoltre le normative federali, vietano alle pubblicità di includere contenuto che “contenga informazioni o opinioni a favore di un farmaco che prima veniva considerato valido ma che sono state invalidate da informazioni contrarie più recenti e più credibili” [32].<br>  <br>  Questo significa che non è consentita una discrepanza tra quanto viene riportato nella letteratura, che è sempre in aggiornamento e che è sottoposta a revisione tramite peer-review, e la pubblicità. Riguardo ai farmaci SSRI vi è una parte sempre più grande parte della letteratura medica che avanza dubbi dull'ipotesi della serotonina, e quanto affermato da questa parte non trova alcun riferimento nella pubblicità rivolta ai consumatori. In particolare molte campagne pubblicitarie dei farmaci SSRI continuano ad affermare che il meccanismo d'azione dei farmaci SSRI sia quello di correggere uno sbilanciamento chimico. Un esempio è quello della la pubblicità della paroxetine“: “Con un trattamento continuo il Paxil può aiutare a ripristinare il bilancimento della serotonina” [22]. Tuttavia, come è spiegato prima, non è mai stata stabilito in modo scientificamente corretto una cosa come il Il messaggio che rimane nei consumatori vedendo la pubblicità dei farmaci SSRI probabilmente è quello che i farmaci SSRI funzionano portando alla normalità i neurotrasmettitori che se ne sono andati via. Questa era quello che si sperava 30 anni fa, ma è una cosa che non è accurata in base alle prove scientifiche dei giorni d'oggi.<br>  <br>  La FDA ha inviato dieci lettere di avvertimento ai produttori di antidepressivi dal 1997 [34-43], ma non ha mai citato in giudizio una casa farmaceutica per il motivo qui esposto. Non sono chiari i motivi per cui non abbia mai agito, ma sembra che risulti da una deliberata decisione presa ad un certo livello della FDA piuttosto che da una trascuratezza. A partire dal 2002 uno degli autori di questo articolo (JRL) ha ripetutamente contattato la FDA su questa questione. L'unica sostanziale risposta è stata un'e-mail da una persona che faceva il revisore alla FDA: “Le vostre preoccupazioni sulla pubblicità diretta ai consumatori sollevano un a questione interessante sulla validità delle affermazioni riduzionalistiche. Queste affermazioni sono usate con l'obiettivo di descrivere il presunto meccanismo della azione (o delle azioni) dei neurotrasmettitori ad una frazione del pubblico che ha delle capacità di lettura non superiori al sesto livello” (comunicazione privata 11 aprile 2002).<br>  <br>  è curioso che queste pubblicità siano considerate appropriate per chi ha scarse capacità di lettura. Se le cose che stanno attorno agli antidepressivi sono troppo difficili per essere spiegate ad un pubblico generico, allora uno si può chiedere come mai sia possibile che sia permessa la pubblicità diretta al pubblico degli antidepressivi. Tuttavia, al contrario di quanto la FDA sembrerebbe voler affermare, la verità e la semplicità non sono due cose mutamente esclusive. Considerate ad esempio il libro di testo di medicina Essential Psychopharmacology, in cui vi e scritto: “Finora non vi è nessuna prova chiara e convincente che la carenza di monoamine sia responsabile della depressione; cioè non vi è una "reale" carenza delle monoamine” [44]. Questa spiegazione è tanto semplice quanto sono semplici quelle nelle pubblicità delle case farmaceutiche, tuttavia mostrano una realtà ben diversa circa l'ipotesi della serotonina.<br>  <br>  Conclusioni<br>  <br>  L'impatto che hanno avuto la promozioni, sparse ovunque, dell'ipotesi della serotonina non deve essere sottostimato. Le pubblicità degli antidepressivi si trovano dappertutto sui media Americani e vi sono delle prove emergenti che queste pubblicità abbiano la possibilità di confondere il rapporto tra il medico ed il paziente. Un studio recente di Kravitz ed altri ha trovato che a dei finti pazienti (degli attori che si sono allenati per fingersi pazienti) che si presentavano con i sintomi di un disturbo di adattamento (una condizione per la quale normalmente non vengono prescritti gli antidepressivi) veniva prescritta la paroxetine (Paxil) dal proprio medico, se facevano esplicitamente delle richieste sul Paxil [45]; queste richieste da parte di un paziente qualsiasi potrebbero essere causate dalla pubblicità diretta al pubblico [45].<br>  <br>  Quello che rimane non misurato, tuttavia, è quanti pazienti si rivolgono al proprio medico a chiedere aiuto perché la pubblicità degli antidepressivi li ha convinti che soffrono di una mancanza di serotonina. Queste pubblicità presentano un concetto seduttivo e il fatto che i pazienti ora si presentino con autodefinito "scompenso chimico" [46] mostra che la pubblicità diretta al pubblico sta avendo l'effetto desiderato; il mercato sanitario si sta prendendo la forma che è vantaggiosa per le case farmaceutiche. Recentemente si è affermato che la FDA sia più preoccupata nel proteggere l'industria farmaceutica che non della sua missione di proteggere il consumatore statunitense e che i tentativi di rafforzarla siano stati diminuiti [47]. è molto probabile che i pazienti che sono convinti di soffrire per una carenza di un neurotrasmettitore richiedano una prescrizione di un antidepressivo e che possano essere scettici quando un medico li suggerisce un altro tipo di intervento, come la terapia cognitiva-comportamentale [48], basata o meno su prove. Come nel caso di altre popolazioni vulnerabili, i pazienti ansiosi e depressi “probabilmente sono più, suscettibili di essere condizionati dalla pubblicità” [49].<br>  <br>  Nel 1998, agli inizi delle campagne pubblicitarie dei farmaci SSRI, Elliot Valenstein professore emerito di Nuroscienze ha fatto un riassunto delle conoscenze scientifiche concludendo che “Quello che i medici e i pazienti stanno leggendo a proposito delle malattie mentali non è per nulla una naturale riflesso di tutte le informazioni disponibili.” [50]. Lo stato attuale della quesitone non fa altro che confermare la veridicità di questa conclusione. Vi è una notevole differenza tra la letteratura scientifica e le affermazioni fatte nella pubblicità dei farmaci SSRI, controllate dalla FDA, e probabilmente non vi è un parallelo tra le due cose.<br>  <br>  www.nopsych.it|`|TbWEiQMRaa	Si|`|adc5fe76a263cff6f262530d611d0b04aa	Si, se non vi è motivo apparente. <br>  Invece, se sei triste perchè sei disoccupato (per esempio) mi sa che non basta un buon piatto di pastasciutta!

Try to keep your weight down.Treatment focuses on pain relief and halting the progression of the disease. It may include analgesics, anti-inflammatories, rest, physical therapy, exercise and occupational therapy. Lifestyle changes such as weight loss and use of assistive devices may help some people. Nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin, are sometimes used to relieve pain. If joints are seriously degenerated and are painful, surgery to replace joints or fuse bones may be performed.|`|bFCGBQnxaa	Actually total joint repairs are the last resort of osteoarthritis but that is when it gets as bad as it can get.

The type of surgery that they use alot is fusion of joints or bones together to relieve pain. Therapy is done not to cure but to alleviate symptoms for a period of time. We do hot and cold compressions to the joint, more hot than cold, muscle strengthening exercises, and electrical stimulation which is a stimulation that is used to strengthen muscles as well, also we use supportive devices that are used when times are worse throughout the day and also to lessen the weight off of the joints. Hope this has helped.

Aiuta anche a ridurre il flusso e nel caso di dolori forti. Alcune sono mirate a ridurre il problema dell'acne. L'anticoncezionenale è molto sicuro ma non al 100%.|`|95Drxj8Laa	certo che si!|`|K6bl3JZIaa	si si...funziona!!|`|RmVBlJKcaa	sicuramente! proprio l'altro giorno ho avuto una conferenza cn una ginecologa e ci ha detto che la possono utilizzare tutti...nn sl per "quello scopo" ,ma anche per chi ha il ciclo doloroso o viene cn ritardi...<br>  <br>  ciao<br>  cmq puoi consultare anche online dei siti dv si discutono sl di qst cose... o magari parlarne cn il tuo ginecologo!...besos!!!XD|`|TbWEiQMRaa	Si, e' uno dei suoi usi.|`|fYzwtFfJaa	certo ke funziona sul serio la pillola dal ginecologo nn viene somministrata solo per anticoncezionale anke per regolare il ciclo pensa ke anke ragazze di 14 anni la assumono!!!poi ad ogni donna la pillola piu adatta a lei....|`|jQg4Sp01aa	Ma certamente!!E' una bella invenzione!Sai quasi con certezza assoluta quando ti vengono!|`|xpgIdN5Oaa	prima dovresti fare delle analisi ormonali per vedere da cosa dipende la tua irregolarità mestruale, e anche QUALE tipo di pillola sia quella più adatta al tuo caso. comunque diciamo che in media la maggior parte delle irregolarità mestruali migliora notevolmente dopo un trattamento ormonale (pillola).<br>  considera inoltre che, a seconda di quale sia il tuo problema (Es: carenza di un determinato ormone) potresti aver bisogno di prendere la pillola, ciclicamente, anche fino alla prima gravidanza, ad esempio...|`|28605eebab7d1206bc65518f086da460aa	certo che funziona...ma serve anche a tante altre cose...e può avere effetti collaterali anche seri...meglio chiedere il parere di un medico e se è il caso fare tutte le analisi prima di iniziare la cura....|`|1399c1ae094c949f83eb98986234ac52aa	Beh in un senso più che altro figurato...<br>  In realtà colla pillola non si hanno le mestruazioni, quindi non "regolarizza" le mestruazioni. Si ha il "ciclo da sospensione" nella settimana di pausa.<br>  Nella maggioranza dei casi poi è soltanto un palliativo, giacchè non "regolarizza" nulla, appena la smetti le mestruazioni ti ritornano irregolari, se prima le avevi così.

ZRScOoU7aa	Stop worrying about it - you are absolutely normal! People on here ask things about irregular periods all the time, but most of them are fully-grown women that have had their periods for years! It is absolutely normal for your period to be a bit irregular when you first start, it's absolutely nothing to worry about! And if it continues when you get older, that's just your body's natural system! x|`|n1PfMlnRaa	mmmmmm..... takes awhile for everything to become regular.  talk to your mother or father though.|`|2cdyjlJfaa	Don't worry! At your age, irregular periods are to be expected. After a few years, they'll most likely regulate themselves.|`|XrSVU3bIaa	Hey hun..I was 12 when I got my first one too and have it for about 3 years now. All of what you said is very normal. You have nothing to worry about sometimes you get cramps other times you dont. It all sounds okay to me!!

So just realx, its fine.|`|1n84hjeEaa	It might be normal as your body is adjusting to this new thing happening. Once you get it a few times it will probably regulate itself, sometimes that can take a while though...any where from a couple months to a year or so.  If you are concerned about it though go see your doctor. :) Welcome to womanhood!|`|NCtt9OrUaa	aww lol dont worry.everybody's body type is different.you might be growing and maturing/developing into a woman while having that.when i first got my period i had it for 10 days and it was so heavy and it seemed to go on for ages:)<br>  dont worry it will be regular soon like just a few more months.dont worry!:)|`|ZwzHwEyXaa	You might think this is strange, but it happens. I got my period for the first time a couple years ago, and it lasted a couple days, stopped for, maybe three days, and I got it again! Plus, after i got my period a couple of times, I skipped my period for about two or three months! I also sometimes do, and smetimes don't get cramps. The thing to do is just wait it out, and eventually, your period will "regulate."|`|gmA2kX2Daa	when you first start, your period usually is irregular like that. dont worry. it happens to everyone. it takes probably two years for your period to be somewhat regular.  dont stress about it. if you still feel that something is really wrong with you, talk to your mom and maybe you can take a trip to a doctor. but trust me, from what you said, you're perfectly normal!

AA11989999	Think in terms of the Long Run, not the short run. Washing sodium out of your body tends to take water with it. Sodium holds water in, and works in the blood stream. Too much of it causes swelling, edema, and hypertension. Potassium is the co-antagonist partner of sodium , and it works INSIDE the cell tissues to hold water there. <br>  <br>    Ask your doc for a saluretic. A diuretic only increases urine production. A saluretic gets rid of sodium specifically. Like hydrochlorthyazide or furosemide (Lasix). That gets both salt and potassium out of the system. Compensate by eating potassium-rich foods. Potassium is widely found, everywhere in diets, but is especially abundant in potatoes, bananas, tomatoes, and other fruits and vegetables. <br>  <br>    One more friendly word to you, about the time scale to look at. You seem to be watching your exact weight every day, along with your exercise time and calories. Isn't this a bit burdensome? All you really need are weekly goals, not daily reports. Frankly, you are freaking out more than you need to. The laws of physics operate here.  Your weight is affected by sweating, urination, defecation, eating meals, fluid intake, and exercise. Surely you are not measuring ALL of those variable precisely, each day. Or are you?|`|N956bVxhaa	How do you know the weight you've gained is "water weight"?  How are you able to distinguish between the "water weight" you want to get rid of, and the "normal weight" you want to keep?<br>  <br>  This question doesn't make any sense<br>  <br>  EDIT ---->  I think I raise a fair question - first you weigh 231, then you eat a bunch of pizza, and then you weigh 236. Why blame it on water?  I would blame the pizza.|`|g8pRhElsaa	because your body retains water when it thinks it's not getting enough. if you drink lots of water, it will know that you're now getting enough to be fully hydrated and should get rid of the water weight. <br>  <br>  and if you drink lots, it should be pretty soon that the water weight comes off. just avoid dark sodas and salt.|`|HLLUMdr6aa	Hey there. :)<br>  <br>  Your body only needs a finite amount of water, therefore, if you drink an excess of water, your body will flush out the excess until it only has the amount needed in it. Hence why you pee a lot when you drink a lot!<br>  <br>  As for normal weight, one or two days usually. :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	I dont know what this means exactly but my guess is that your body is holding in the water because it doesnt get enough. If you start to drink a good amount of water then your body will learn that it doesnt need to hold in the water because some more will come when its thirsty.|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	It helps in flushing the excess impurities in your system.  Like excess SALT.  But please be careful you can drink too much water and cause some serious problems.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	That doesn't sound right to me, to drink more water.  You need to take water tablets to reduce your water retention. Depends on how old you are of course.  Get medical advice.|`|f0a32e61345899913bee88cf33014f9daa	no, drinking more water will increase your water weight, you need to drink a diuretic like cranberry juice.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	If you keep on drinking water, it is supposed to flush the excess water out|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	You don't believe me after all of the things the aliens taught me? lol Well drinking water is not a 100% guarantee you will lose that weight.

If you drink alot of water and keep your body hydrated, then your body will automatically release the stored water.  It takes a while for your body to recognize this so you have to keep drinking it.|`|KDUwFiBPaa	It is because you're body is dehydrated and holding onto the water it has.  Once you keep hydrating yourself regularly, your body won't retain unnecessary water since it believes more will be on it's way.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Because the excess water is elminated quickly, and takes with it all the things that are causing the retention. Like salt.

But when you purge your food, the stomach acid can, and after a while definitely will, burn the lining of your esophagus. Be smart and don't do either. Eat a healthy diet and you'll be fine.|`|2953d7ba3f65ae2e64bbd679f73d1fbdaa	They are obviously both bad, but binge and purge would be the worst one being that you're forcing food out of your body cause damage to several organs with all that acid on the way out. Fasting on the other hand is actually used all over the world as a way to allow  your body to rest and rid it of all harmful toxins, and some use it as a form of spiritual practice. Of course, once the fast is over, one should follow a high quality, diet to remain in balance.|`|5PWEBOj0aa	Dont do either one! I did the purge thing in college and it was such a bad idea!! When I decided to stop doing it I couldn't.. because I had ruined a part of my body... the part of your throat that closes your stomach didnt work anymore.. I got the the point where I could only eat pasta, because to eat anything else the acid hurt so much coming back up... nasty I know.. but just don't do it!! I had to have surgery to fix it, and now I have scars on my stomach from the surgery.. totally not worth it!! if you really are serious about losing weight, I would see a dietitian and she can recommend the smallest about of calories for you, and she can set your diet up so that you WILL lose weight in a healthy way!!|`|e5f0c993dc43986b75d483b1ea872bc2aa	Neither choice is a good one. You can eat and maintain your weight or even lose it.  Binging is very bad for your heart and teeth. Anorexia starves your body to death.  You body will get what it needs from your muscles and waist you away.  You can die from doing either.  Learning to eat healthier and that includes treats now and then will be Better in the long run.|`|ADEDkCgOaa	not eat then eat a lot. it wont help with anything. i sometimes dont eat when i am trying to loose a couple pounds. but if you go from not eating to eating a lot then your body will store it all as fat and thats not good. try eating fruits or veggies or pretzels when you get hungry. they have little to no fat in them.

What is going on with you psychologically (in your mind) has a huge impact on the rest of your well being.  I have sometimes upset myself so much that I actually throw up.  What you need to do is take a deep breath.  Try to plan out the scenarios in your mind of what you think might happen tomorrow and how you will deal with each one.  That way you will be prepared.  Think of your worst case scenario and make sure you plan for it.  That way you can relax and know what you are going to do.  Then you may be able to relax a little.  But know this.  Whatever you are concocting in your mind is always worse than what really happens.  <br>  Good Luck to you. I hope nothing happens.<br>  <br>  Remember one more thing.  If you can't deal with it today, then there is nothing you can do about it today.  Deal with it tomorrow when it happens.|`|AA10300538	Yup. Everytime im nervous i have diarrhoea.<br>  Its gross to admitt, lol, but yeah...i get real sick. Sometimes, i even throw up. I get headaches sometimes too.<br>  And i know when i about to fly somewhere (or travel long distances in general) i get sick...BEFORE i start on the journey.<br>  So yea, being nervous can make u sick.|`|WLoQOpPSaa	Yes it can,it happens to me too. Try to relax and do something to occupy your mind. if you can get crystallised ginger eating that helps take away the sickly feeling or drink ginger ale. What ever it is you are nervous about tomorrow I wish you good luck.x|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Yes. Being nervous can give you a headache, an upset stomach, any number of anxiety-ridden physical reactions.

QRCQJF6Faa	The mind is a powerful thing. In your case you have already told yourself "I will run out of breath" so that is what you believe, even though you know rationally you won't and that it is silly it is still your "belief". So, how to fix it.. reprogram yourself. Sounds easy and it is! What you need to do is this.. First start at night, right before you go to sleep, in the moments as you are falling asleep picture yourself running faster and faster and at the same time keep taking low slow deep breaths all the while repeating to yourself "I can breath just fine, I can not run out of breath". Keep repeating that to yourself as you fall asleep. Do this for at least 1 week, every night. Also when you run that week, repeat that same mantra "I can breath just fine, I can not run out of breath". In time, my guess is a week or two max, you should overwrite the old "I am going to die" with a new "I feel great and can breath" attitude and will be running faster and better in no time.<br>  <br>  This is basic self hypnosis, if you want to read more on it check the internet as I am sure there are a lot of resources out there. I have used this to help me do many things in life and it works, you just need to change the internal tapes in your brain.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Adam-O|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	you wont die, if you become short of breathe then stop and catch your breathe back just to reassure yourself. It's normal to breathe heavy when running and to slow down after a while. and running ia a part of your career so you could consider going to see a phobia person or your doctor just to get it sorted.
3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Circumcision is a quick, simple and safe external operation that can be performed at any age under a local anaesthetic in the doctor's office.<br>  <br>  The anaesthetic ensures that there is no pain during the operation.  After the anaesthetic wears off (about 2-3 hours later) there will almost certainly be a degree of discomfort but this is not really able to be described as pain.  There will be some discomfort for about a week as the healing takes place and until the sutures (stitches) are all out.  Ordinary 'headache' tablets are all that is needed to cover the discomfort, although many men don't even feel the need for them.<br>  <br>  The main healing takes place is about 7-10 days after which the sutures can be removed if they have not already dissolved.  Once the sutures are out the swelling will start to subside and will all have gone in 3-4 weeks after the operation.<br>  <br>  Full normal sex can be resumed after 4-5 weeks, although a condom is strongly advised to prevent any damage to the delicate new skin.  Gentle masturbation can be resumed after the sutures are out.<br>  <br>  The cost of a circumcision depends on where you are, which doctor you choose and if he insists on a general anaesthetic (totally unnecessary and much more costly).  A typical USA cost would be $600 - $ 1500.<br>  <br>  It is not normal for your urine to burn after circumcision but it might do for the first couple of times if the meatus (pee hole) was inflamed before your circumcision.|`|MU0gh8IFaa	avoid it masturbate more often slowly and with lubes it will help u in the long run<br>  <br>  avoid <br>  <br>  only MASTURBATE OFTENER thats the secret of good health |`|YiFl2em2aa	I have absolutely no idea.|`|358aaaa8c788b94641d4f774b758d97daa	just a little pr*ck..|`|Cf0k9UWMaa	i cant believe these answers,this is the 21st Century for gods sake man,no kind of genital mutilation should be talked of like this,there are many many men who complain of a lack of feeling due to circumcision,these men suffer it for life,if your foreskin is painful as you say then i suggest you consider growing it,it can be done,talk to a doctor.<br>  please please don't consider this archaic barbaric ritualistic torture and lets be real nor should anyone else,for themselves or there children.|`|ihIAqEdWaa	In my experience it did not hurt at all.

It reduces the size of the penis, it destroys about 50% of sexual sensitivity and diminishes sexual ability.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you look at the site circumstitions to see the complications involved---the doctors don't give disclosure on the ramifications of this mutilation.<br>  <br>  There is a small operation called a preputioplasty, or dorsal slit, which cuts a small incision in the foreskin opening, which is less drastic and painful, doesn't amputate the 20-30,000 or so nerve receptors in the foreskin, and requires less time for healing.      Few doctors will offer this, as they like to chop off men's foreskins, as they make money from it and are frequently members of the religions that try to force this mutilation on others.<br>  <br>  I had more than the usual damage from circumcision as an infant, and it destroyed my sex life.      I am restoring my foreskin, and with it my sensitivity and sexual ability.     Orgasms have also increased in intensity like nothing I ever knew before.<br>  <br>  Keep your penis whole.

That's only when you are circumcised as a baby. You can go get sterriod creams from the doctor and those work REALLY well. Regular lotions won't work so there wasn't a point in trying those. You can get circumcised and it will hurt really bad and it won't heal for about 6-7 weeks. And you CANT have sex without a condom for 3 months after in risk of reoppening the wound. Circumcision reduces sexual pleasure by a lot so you won't enjoy sex and masturbation as much. Keep that in mind.

But it's nothing that some pain medication can't take care of.<br>  <br>  I had the procedure done when I was 16 because I was having the same problem you're having now.  When you wake up, they will have your penis all bandaged up.  You'll be able to pee just fine, but you'll want to keep it in its dressing for a couple of days.  Once you take it off, it'll be very swollen and the incision may ooze a little bit.  Totally normal.  When you take showers, cover your penis with some saran wrap and a rubber band to keep it in place.  It's very very important to keep it clean.  In a couple of weeks, it should be better.<br>  <br>  During recovery, it goes without saying that you shouldn't even THINK about sex.  At night, I felt some discomfort (although not really "pain") because you get erections during the night.<br>  <br>  All in all, it certainly wasn't the most awful experience.  Honestly, having my wisdom teeth removed was much worse.  A circumcision was also TOTALLY worth it.

It makes them think "well, i'll never be able to live up to him...she won't love me as much".<br>  <br>  Romantically, your boyfriend should be top priority or he shouldn't be your boyfriend. Family-wise, if your dad is the one you're closet to, than he should be top priority. <br>  <br>  Unless you want to bring down the guys in your life, make them priorities of separate categories. My boyfriend knows he's my number 1 when it comes to romantic and friendship love. But he also knows that my closet guy friend (who's like a brother to me) is my number 1 when it comes to family love. And he accepts it and is absolutely fine with it. He just wants to be number 1 somewhere.|`|el8yX5q3aa	There is nothing wrong with loving your family and respecting them and putting them first.  however there comes a time when you have to make a life and put someone else first.  Maybe this guy isn't the one for you that is why you don't feel that way.<br>  <br>  maybe it is the way you worded it.  What you might have said was...when the time is right and I find the person I am to spend my life with ...my dad will always be my number one hero...but my spouse will also be my number one hero.  You can't compare apples to oranges but making someone understand that your dad and mom are very important to you is not wrong.  It is just the way you worded it.<br>  <br>  I always said family comes first.  When you marry however your husband IS your family...and parents.  Your husband is your life...when you marry.<br>  <br>  You CANNOT let your relationship with your father interferr with who you choose to spend your life with.  No man likes to be second to anyone...especially a dad.  You are creating a competition he can't win .  You want to be sure to have BOTH of them in your life but when you find that special someone...THEY come first.  it is time to cut the apron strings and grow up some. <br>  <br>  I want you to understand this is WHEN you find someone you want to spend  your life with...until then..stay away from that subject with boyfriends...it is true your dad is number one but you don't need to tell THEM that !|`|10f90c085c720dd1dd72d6ccc4cd2448aa	He should not be upset at all, but you have to make sure you make him feel loved and special and just never mention it again like that to him, because he should know that your father is first in your life so therefore you don;t have to say it.

Now, you can stay on your pedestal all you want and think 'no, that wouldn't both me one bit' but you know deep down that it hurts to know that throughout the rest of your relationship with this person you'll always be 2nd best, you'll never be as good as that one person, you'll always come after.<br>  <br>  It hurts when you have 2 important people in your life  and you're choosing one over the other. One person will always think 'i'll never be as good as his/her dad or mom or brother or sister or friend, i'll always be less important than them'. It can really bring a person down. <br>  <br>  When  it comes to family and truly committed relationships, i've always put them on the same level. I'm a huge momma's boy but i love my girlfriend to death and don't want to make her feel inferior to my mom. I love them both so much, just in different ways so it's stupid and mean to say one of the them means more to me than the other does.|`|ZGZ4HqoIaa	There is that unconditional "Love" between parents and their children that can never be broken. Your boyfriend needs to man up and realize he will never ever compare to or measure up to your father as far as your deep inner feelings go, as strong as your love is for your father, if someone could make it to a close 2nd place they would be doing good. And they should be happy with that. There shouldn't be any competition between a boyfriend and a father. He won't realize this until the day he has his own daughter, he will understand. One day, when you find that special guy in your life, a special place will open up in your heart just for him and no one will ever be able to compare or measure up to him either. God Bless  |`|peMrRVwxaa	You are 100% right.  I am a daddy's girl too, and always will be.  Your father was the first man in your life and no matter what, will always be there for you.  Other men will come and go, but daddy is always there, and no matter what you do, will always love you.  Sure you may one day find the love of your life and get married.  It doesnt mean he is any less important, but it is a different kind of love.  Most guys once they get mature enough will understand that, and if they don't, well they don't have very good family values and you shouldn't be worried about them.
c4bd6a58fd70f6127741305c6f23f44faa	I have had IBS for years and that happens to me. when you go so much you put stress on " that part"  and you do tear. they are probably minor cuts. and it burns if you pee and the pee touches them. but use your own judgment.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Your mom is right, dark red/black blood is more worrisome than bright. Dark red indicates coagulation which means there's a tear/ulcer/something high in the digestive tract as opposed to a normal tear in the rectum (bright red blood). Since the blood has only been in second/third BMs and not the first it's very likely you just have a minor tear that is having trouble healing from all of the...activity...down there. If it hasn't healed up in about a week, I'd recommend calling your doc!|`|WWhYCAbSaa	Call the doctor back and make another appointment.  <br>  <br>  My dog, just the other day, had blood in his stool.  I immediately called the vet to ask about it, and they said to bring a stool sample in.  So I did.  They called me back saying it was an overgrowth of bacteria in his stomach, caused by stress.  The vet prescribed antibiotics for five days.  This is his second or third day on it, and he's doing great.  This little guy has been bounced around quite a bit recently.  They said to bring him in later.  But before I brought him in, he had no blood, which some people would mistake for things being better had I not brought in a stool sample.  And his was bright red.  People who worry a lot over things have the same problems.<br>  <br>  You may have the human version of it.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry, as worry aggravates such things.|`|F89MNQheaa	I would still make an appointment with the doctor to be refered to gastroenterology, I know your mum is a nurse but she isnt a specialist. It sounds to me like a tear as your stools will have been harder as you have been constipated but it is best to be checked all the same then you wont worry any more and you will be certain your bowels are in good condition, because to bleed is not a great sign and shouldnt be left undiagnosed properly.  Good luck, im sure you will be fine.<br>  * Edit<br>  If your mum has crohns you will probably be refered for a colonoscopy and have a biopsy taken as it tends to run in familys|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	it could be a tear try not to worry too much as it will add to your stress
gHRbi3c5aa	IBS can be managed if you can identify what irritates your bowls most.<br>  <br>  sometimes wheat products - such as bread can be a problem; sometimes fruit, sometimes dairy - different people, different triggers.<br>  <br>  You could/ should also try a spoonful of sugar (brown is best) - at first every 3 hours, then once or twice a day - this will soften your stools and reduce/ stop the tearing and will actually, after a couple of days, help to re-balance your system .<br>  <br>  Sugar has a lot of good properties but it must just be sugar - demerara is best - and no sugary stuff like chocolate or ice cream or sweets<br>  <br>  Some people recommend increasing your intake of fibre. Also increase your intake of water - just water - help cleanse your system; cut out caffeine (tea coke and such stuff also have caffeine)<br>  <br>  You should monitor your bowel movement - when you've eaten, when you have a BM, if there is or isn't blood, how much blood - every time then you'll see if there's a pattern. This you can take to your doc and get better advice than random appointments.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	eliminate all milk products from your diet, drink lotsa water, increase your dose of probiotics, keep a food diary, and see a GI doctor.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	You may just need antibiotics from a regular doctor.  This may not have anything to do with IBS.

7UkRpqZuaa	Just don't completely deprive yourself.  It's all about moderation.  Sounds good to me.  In my opinion, I think we should listen to our bodies and only eat when we're hungry (NOT ravenous).  Your body tells you what it needs, if you just listen to it.  So no, nothing wrong with skipping meals, if you're not hungry.  Just don't wait till you're starving to eat.  If you eat when you're a little hungry, you'll eat slowly, and stop sooner.  Try adding some protein to breakfast, like peanut butter or a hard boiled egg.  (Omega 3 enhanced, or farm fresh.) Your workout will be more effective if you rest every other day, also.  Just pace yourself, or you'll crash and burn.  And don't diet!  Eating healthfully should be a lifestyle, that's the only way you'll see and keep results and feel energized.  Lose weight slowly, and it'll stay off.|`|qTO6GPevaa	You already lost 4 lbs so it's working for you, also you're eating healthy and exercising, as long as you don't skip meals (that will lower your metabolism) looks like your routine is perfect! Good luck!|`|XQmp6TQLaa	I think it's okay, but you're not over weight or anything. You're weight is actually normal for your height, but good luck(:|`|f683Yx48aa	You're eating mostly healthy foods. And "light" or "fat free" foods will have partially hydrogenated oils in them (trans fat).<br>  <br>  Skipping meals is not good for your metabolism, but you also shouldn't eat when you're not hungry. I go by what I have dubbed the "Hunger Scale" where 1 = not hungry and 10 = get out of my way I need food NOW. You should always eat when you're around a 6.<br>  <br>  To get better exercising results, you should switch up your routine often. Doing the same thing over and over again makes your body bored.<br>  <br>   You need to add cardio in with the strength training to get leaner muscles and better results.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're eating whole grains with your meals. Carrots and grapes are good, but you need to add in more!<br>  <br>  DON'T EAT LESS THAN 1200 CALORIES A DAY!!|`|TAjQkoknaa	I think you should not be skipping meals... everything else I think is great... also don't try to lose too much weight in a short time because it won't be good to your body and you could gain that weight very easily too... :(|`|o4MpcKxtaa	Your routine is perfect! =) Keep it up!|`|P7XYrXNmaa	The diet strategy you are losing is not safe. You need to eat 5 or  6 small meals a day, and exercise for about 30-60 min. five days a week! Your workout routine should include muscles and cardio! <br>  Eat healthy, cut out junk/fast food, drink at least 8 cups of water a day.....DO NO STARVE YOURSELF or SKIP MEALS! Try exercising in the morning too! 5 or 6 small meals is better then 3 big meals or 3 small, pitiful non-filling meals! Eat protein and fiber with every meal and fruits and veggies and whole wheats!|`|tjGcDWUTaa	Looks pretty good to me. Although 5'7" and 140 I can't believe that you're not skinny. Anywho, just make sure you staying above 1500 calories a day and you should be fine. But siwtching to whole grains and eating more fruits and vegetables is always a step in the correct direction.<br>  <br>  If you really want to burn some major calories to help with your midsection, try getting some cardio in 3-4 times a week. In order to lose weight in one part of your body you have to lose it in all parts of your body. Sorry it's physics.<br>  <br>  If you eat red meat, you should try eating it once or twice a week. Red meat has creatine in it which helps promote muscle growth. Whey protein in milk does the same thing.<br>  <br>  Keep it up. I'm sure you'll be fit for your vacation.|`|886dfafbd6f5644cc761edf6bd820abeaa	i think you are doing great.  sounds like what i did to lose 40 pounds after my daughter was born.<br>  you are good on fiber, just make sure you are getting enough protein.  try canned light tuna in water, egg white omelettes, hard boiled eggs (only having one yolk).<br>  make sure you are getting enough calcium too.<br>  you are doing a great job of losing weight the old fashioned way...through diet and exercise!  and it sounds like your efforts are already paying off.  keep it up!  just remember that to maintain this new weight, you will have to adjust your way of eating for the long haul.|`|Gkzfkjcxaa	Do you just need confirmation.  Of course this is a good diet!  healthy and clean.  Not too much.  Moderate.  <br>  <br>  Looks good to me.
6qqUPXFtaa	When there is nothing that you want than getting pregnant and you are so excited about facing physical and psychological changes but there is always the risk of suffering a sudden depression attributed to hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  During pregnancy, you are vulnerable and your mood and emotions swing easily depending on the way you manage the meaning of being pregnant. Having a support system consisting of your spouse, your family and friends is a must, along with your doctor's advice.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it is possible to stay in touch with pregnancy support centers or get feedback from other pregnant women to relief your fears, but when it is not possible, just take in mind the following guidelines to understand depression and stop it before it causes you harm.<br>  <br>  First, before anything else look inside; ask yourself if you are prepared to become a mother. If you feel you are not, this could just be from the anxieties that exist with becoming a mother the very first time. Exploring your own family history will also let you understand the relation between you and your upcoming baby.<br>  <br>  Caring for yourself is a must during pregnancy and stress associated to depression can be swept away by just anticipating your needs during this wonderful stage of your life, including relationships and knowledge plus the shopping for the material things for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  Emotional support is important, your attitude does count but getting professional help along with your partner, friends and family support will make your pregnancy easy from an emotional approach.

ng071qvwaa	nope. Your liver metabolizes 85-90 percent of the nicotine in a very short while. Since you are not a regular smoker, the rest of it will be metabolized within the next few hours and will not be present at all in your blood. <br>  Additionally, testing for drugs or nicotine would be a completely separate blood test, something your parents would have to ask the doctor for.

368407779143c4323ffd3fb0244979b0aa	Hola bueno yo soy profesional dentro de la psiquiatria y bueno la mayoria de medicamentos por lo menos desde mexico hasta gran parte de sudamenrica se consiguen sin receta. por que los antidepresivos por lo menos la gran mayoria no se consideran psicotropicos, sedantes, antisicoticos, y ansioliticos, o sea trabajan con el sistema hormonal y no precisamente con el sistema nervioso centrar o sea no drogan o sedan a la persona,<br>  <br>  a estos medicamentos que te mencione como el tefil(xana) o el rivotril, valium etc.. se les considera del grupo uno, medicamentos controlados que se si abusa de ellos causaran adiccion. cosa que no pasa con los antidepresivos<br>  <br>  Lo importante es que tengas una consulta con un buen psiquiatra  ya que no nada mas es tomar un antidepresivo y ya! hay distintos tipos, triciclicos, o clasicos,)imipramina)  inhibidores de la recapturacion de la serotonina (sertralina, prozac,) otros que trabajan con la dopamina, los IMAO. etc... ademas de que hay muchos medicamentos nuevos como el remeron por ejemplo tambien sin receta, este ultimo es para depresiones con ataques de panico y ansiedad que por consecuencia causan insomnio y taquicardia. y algunos mas nuevos aun mejores mas efectivos que inclusive se pueden combinar con alcohol, digo esto en cuestion de lo inofensivo,  claro que no recomiendo el alcohol, ya que el alcohol tiene los dos lados de la moneda, primera etapa, anti-depresivo y ansiolitico, y en el bajon, fuertes depresiones sequidos de ataques de panico...<br>  <br>  Entonces no es bueno que nada mas consigas un antidepresivo a si no mas por nomas,. el antidepresivo es algo a si como el antibiotico, y digamos que si la infeccion la tienes en la vejiga y tu tomas un antibiotico para la garganta! no pasara absolutamente nada. <br>  <br>  La sertralina (zoloft, altruline) es uno de los antidepresivos poco mas economicos y seguros, se comienza con dosis de una pastilla de 50mg por dia y cada semana se aumenta otra pastilla de 50 hasta acompletar 200 o 250mg inclusive hay quien ni si quiera necesita pasar de dos pastillas y en un par de semanas regresar a 50 por dia. ayuda nivelar el sistema hormonal, <br>  <br>  Voy de acuerdo por ejemplo con la hierba de san juan o mejor conocido como HIPERIKAN,. tambien es sin receta pero tambien necesitas que sea un especialista quien te de las dosis, ademas de que el hiperikan solo es para personas con depresiones leves o solo principios de depresion, <br>  en depresiones con crisis de panico, ansiedad, terror, ausentismos, sopor depresivo etc... el hiperikan no hace ni cosquillas. <br>  <br>  Tambien te recomiendo que tomes por lo menos dos veces al a?o suplementos de Complejo B, Puede ser tomado o inyectado, esto reforza nuestras fibras nerviosas, tomar bastante agua.<br>  por estos dias de depresion dejar la cafeina por completo.<br>  <br>  y despues de las 6 pm, nada de cafe, refrescos de cola, chocolates, ya que estos alteran la presion arterial causando taquicardias, que no son graves pero si muy molestas y ansiedad. <br>  <br>  Hay un te que yo siempre recomiendo no es como la valeriana, 7 azhares etc.. que son tes que intentan ser sedantes o inducir al sue?o. y pueden afectar tu diario vivir. <br>  <br>  El te se llama Toronjil, es natural tambien pero mas que efectos sedantes tiene efectos antidepresivos, ayudando tambien a evitar la recapturacion de serotonina/<br>  y no te asustes tanto que un antidepresivo bien usado no causa adiccion, ni esos famosos efectos secundarios que se les inventan, una cosa son ansioliticos hipnoticos (que no causan sue?o pero controlan la ansiedad) otro es el ansiolitico hipnotico o sedante, ( que si causa sue?o o seda a la persona trabajando tambien con la ansiedad y panico, y alguien por aqui comento del litio, este se administra cuando hay la condicion es bipolar o mejor conocida como maniaco-depresivo. a estos se les debe tratar con litiu y el antidepresivo. <br>  <br>  Ufff larga la respuesta ojala les ayude un poco <br>  <br>  saludos|`|281e2043f460d60146c852c1c5792ee3aa	Chocolate, no necesita receta y super recomendado para depresiones, si lo tomas en helado mejor y te lo digo en serio.

GWyKZ3aiaa	Lowrie. I think you are a little young to be doing this...at least you sound young. There is no real need to shave your personal area. It is itchy when it growns out and not all that important for sanitary reasons, as long as you keep yourself clean. My advise is to stop shaving as if you are getting all of these bumos etc, this can only open you up to infection down the road. Just keep it trimmed if you are real hairy.|`|yfn6ZCk5aa	Well, you should always shave with shaving cream or gel to avoid the razor burns. and my girlfriend and i are 15 and she waxes|`|6bQ8UX1eaa	Do it whilst in bath or shower so its not raw dry, and use either shaving cream or showergel. :]|`|6tmbhLr9aa	Use water or a lubricant like shaving cream...|`|AA11004428	youre way too young. trimming is one thing but shaving at 13,14...i say no.|`|v6CyvHLyaa	You don't sound old enough for people to be looking down there, so why not just stop shaving and leave it until it actually matters?

w0ZqjJBtaa	It is normal for periods to change their routine from time to time with age. Are you on the pill? The smear test would only serve to detect any changes in the cervical cells that are abnormal. You may need to have an STI check, where certain infections are looked for. A lot of infections are only picked up, if they are specifically looked for. It could also be fibroids due to the pain you are experiencing and bleeding. My advice is to make an appointment with your GP and local STI clinic. Try not to worry but seek further medical help.|`|NNwEuC8paa	I'm younger then you and my period has changed a bunch of times, its very normal, you might be pregnant though, what was the period like?

It was super easy to quit, and I felt great the three months I was on them. If you are sensitive to coming off meds, I would recommend not ending the medication immediately, but taper off. I finished my third month and didn't refill my prescription, and within a few days I was so depressed and miserable I couldn't get out of bed. I don't think it was the Chantix, as I never felt bad while on it, but the reaction my body had from coming off of it. Anyway, I couldn't get out of bed for two months, cried all the time and just couldn't handle life in general, so I started smoking again. When I'm ready, I'll do the Chantix again, but I'll make sure to have some coping mechanisms in place to help me through the lifestyle change.
3VeqE9Oaaa	Hi Micah!<br>  <br>  You are on a good plan for exercise, so nice job! I wouldn't focus on the scale weight if I were you, because those tapes you bought, will increase your lean body mass, which weighs more than fat. Those tapes tend to "slim out" the body, while you hold and elongate the muscles, so they do build muscle. The only change I would make, is to not run on your tape days, because that burns muscle, because that becomes your fuel source. On tape days, do only a 20 min. low intensity walking, no incline, just to boost your metabolism more. Save your running for non-tape days, so you hold onto muscle. Muscle is the key to burning fat, and eating 5-6 small meals per day, will help you hold onto that muscle, plus boost your metabolism. Make a few changes, but I like what direction you are in, make sure you eat well, and follow your exercise plan, and rest, don't overdue it!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Good Luck!<br>  <br>  D|`|N956bVxhaa	Depends how many calories you eat.  That has a far greater impact on weight loss than the exercise.|`|z9nCUpaOaa	In a few months.

OR you could just ask and have her and your self tested before you start a sexual relationship... but just dont think "oh im safer just doing oral sex..." your chances are the same as vaginal sex...|`|YwxUeyOCaa	well all those can be caught once u touch the infected are and as for knowing, the only way for a woman to know is by being tested, for a guy its similar but in the case of herpes they will see little bumps on the infected part
aNlT1NRqaa	I don't think working out 6 days a week is necessarily overdoing it, but you are putting a lot of stress on your legs. All your workouts have to do with your legs, they need rest to recover between to heal. Running especially puts a lot of stress on your knees and ankles. You may find yourself unable to walk without pain someday & be more likely to need knee surgery.<br>  <br>  Try something like:<br>  Monday - rest<br>  Tuesday - 5-8 mile run<br>  Wednesday - lift weights<br>  Thursday - Cycle<br>  Friday - swim<br>  Saturday - lift weights & cycle<br>  Sunday - swim & run 5-8 miles<br>  <br>  Try to keep the long runs down to once a month, they do the most damage to knees. Cycling builds better endurance, burns more calories & is much better for the knees and ankles. I put 20 miles on my bike 3-4 times a week, my knees hate any run over 5 miles.<br>  <br>  Update: see the link below.<br>  If you can maintain a 9 mph run for 1 hour (@190 #) you can burn 1294 calories.<br>  Cycling @ 16 mph will burn 1035 calories. <br>  So, if you can maintain that rate running, it is better. But that rate is hard to maintain without stressing the knees. I can maintain 18 mph on a mountain bike for well over an hour & no pain. So I've found cycling to be more effective. If you can maintain an intense run, then you're correct.|`|2KC467tFaa	As long as you pay attention to your body (injuries-taking a break), you have nothing to worry about.

B9nAQ7a3aa	Mirena does not contain estrogen. Many birth control pills do. I have never heard a doctor not recommend a pill for over a year, though. That is a new one for me.<br>  <br>  I have had Mirena for almost 3 years now. I am also very limited in birth control options. My mother has estrogen-depended breast cancer, which puts me at an increased risk... so I have to have an estrogen-free birth control. I am also allergic to latex.<br>  <br>  Mirena also has the lowest doses of hormones of any birth control on the market. Since it is an IUD and not a pill, the hormones mainly stay isolated in your uterus. There are far less side effects as a result. You are immediately covered upon insertion, and it can be removed at any time as well.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me if you have any other questions.|`|AA11352641	Hormones are hormones. If you need to stay away from hormonal birth control methods, Mirena is not right for you. You need a barrier method such as a diaphram or non hormonal IUD such as Paraguard.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	It isn't. I've had my Paraguard (copper) IUD for almost 3 years and even though it doesn't have hormones, I get heavy periods. Some women are allergic to the copper, but I also didn't want anymore hormones and it's been the best option for me. Every form of birth control has potential side effects and every woman will have a different experience.|`|13ca5bfa28957cf9a08b2131fa62965faa	I would get a second opinion on the doctor and pill thing.  I was on the pill for several years no problem.<br>  <br>  And, there is NO "100% Safe" method except for abstinence.|`|t8ngtWhVaa	Mirena only has a small amount of progesterone, it is has no estragon. The hormone in it is localized. That is the major difference. The pill causes the hormones to get into your blood stream and effect your entire body. Mirena, has a small amount of hormones, meant to thicken you cervical mucus so it is harder for the little swimmers to get up there  and it helps in preventing implantation. You still ovulate with Mirena, not with the pill. You can take Mirena out at anytime and your body goes right back to normal. It is the type of birth control I am on, I have been on the pill, the shot, the mini pill and the IUCD, this is by far the best for me. It was painful to have it inserted but it has been good ever since. Good luck|`|tcimGBFeaa	I have a hormone-free IUD in and I have never had any problems with it, the first few months you get a heavier-than-normal period, but than it regulates and goes back to normal. I had it taken out to get pregnant when I was ready and got pregnant within 2 months, after baby was born, I had a new one put back in. I guess they are good for 10-15 years. Instead of the hormones it has natural copper on it which kills the sperm, you should check into it, you can't feel it and you don't have to worry about getting pregnant. Only gross thing is that your doctor will want to put it in DURING your period. But you should check into it!

If you are comfortable enough with him to have sex, then the relationship is probably good enough that it won't be as awkward as you think.|`|ZWcenryjaa	try to be as understanding as possible but you have to tell him asap.<br>  you cant keep getting yeast infections.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|U8wt8vgiaa	Its not an easy thing to tell someone but you will eventually have to do it othewise you might catch something else|`|HBvummz8aa	Just ask him to use it or else no more poon, he'll use it.|`|y3ZAHnBYaa	Use a condom .|`|3YxMNRxGaa	not if you don't sound like you want to be mean|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Just tell him about the infection and say that he needs to be treated as well. Don't blame it on him. He should know yeast infections happen to people and be ok with it. Are you going to use condoms too?<br>  <br>  I doubt you got it from him just because he's uncut. Women commonly develop yeast infections all the time. It's probably not connected to him. I've been having sex with an uncut guy for ages and I've never had a yeast infection in my life, whereas there are lots of women in the USA with circumcised partners who get them often.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|q1YDp1y3aa	Depends on how you bring it up. Truthfully, there's no way to know for sure how you gut thew infection. Tell him that you have been diagnosed with a yeast infection, and that your doctor says he needs to be treated as well, because you can pass it back and forth. If you blame it on him (say that he gave it to you), yeah, he might get a little defensive. -Neb

Noi faremo, noi diremo, noi bestemmieremo) <br>  Un genere musicale imparentato con la disco-dance degli anni '70, ma senza il ritmo coinvolgente, le lucine, i testi scanzonati, i coretti in falsetto, i vestiti pacchiani, le coreografie divertenti. <br>  Un taglio di capelli inventato per errore da Pippo Baudo nel 1992 quando, in diretta TV, gli cadde il parrucchino davanti all'occhio. <br>  Coloro che ascoltano la musica del punto 3 e portano i capelli come nel punto 4. <br>  Prefisso riguardante qualcosa che a che fare con il punto 5 (per esempio EmoRroidi, la malattia tipica dell'emo quando, non trovando più spazio sui polsi per tagliarsi, rivolge l'attenzione delle proprie lamette alla zone perineale)|`|2Gp5j56Xaa	allora se non ricordo male gli EMO sono dei finti punk, coloro che si vestono tutti di quadretti e portano i capelli lunghi e colorati...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://image.forumcommunity.it/1/8/0/9/6/8/0/1199453105.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://image.forumcommunity.it/1/8/0/9/6...</a><br>  <br>  nota i capelli lunghi davanti agli occhi e la cravatta o sciarpa con quadretti...<br>  ciao!|`|DLzk57Tuaa	dicono ke sia 1 stile di vita,nn 1 modo di vestire..vedi l immagine di prima e ti dice tutto.....significa emotional e secondo loro trasmettono emozioni anke se nn sorridono quasi mai...boh ki li capisce...|`|FpA96flEaa	Emeriti minkioni omosessuali!<br>  <br>  =P|`|UI7AxMFEaa	Quindi omosessuali (per la maggiore) autolesionisti?<br>  <br>  Spero che i commenti negativi non siano per il fatto che sono omosessuali... autolesionisti magari perchè sono come un kiunque imbecille che si butta sotto un treno, egoista perchè così non ha più problemi e invece ai parenti tocca pagare i disagi... e la tristezza...

6cwJi5kxaa	Stomach cramps are not associated with tonsilitis. You may be having the cramps to due your period or maybe due to the penicillin. You should call your doctor and let him know your stomach hurts.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	It may be a side effect of the antibiotic.  It often causes diarrhea and stomach pain.  Acidophilus (over the counter supplement) may help you since it maintains the good bacteria in your stomach while the medicine kills the bad bacteria. You should still consult your doctor.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	eat more food when taking meds, drink lotsa water, take probiotics, and inform your doctor.|`|ZjpL4EPLaa	No.  It is not normal.   I have had tonsillitis several times in my life, and have never had stomach cramps.   <br>  <br>  You just started on penicillin:  Have you ever had it before?  My guess is that you are dealing with an allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  I, personally, would call my doctor.  Immediately!|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ it is part of the symptoms of tonsillitis, my son had this a few years back and was taken to hospital with suspected appendicitis... that's how severe the pains can be...apparently.it is caused through the lymphatic system..<^><
sQu3LLqtaa	Could be a magnesium deficiency.  There is plenty of magnesium in nuts.|`|g8pRhElsaa	i've heard it's usually from lack of sleep, but stress could probably do it too. just relax and try to get tons of sleep - i bet it goes away!
yfXhgu8Kaa	I am also 25 pounds about 155. I go protein all the way after an intense workout if you take protein within 15 to 30 minutes it gives your muscles everything they need to recover and grow quickly. I took creatine and after I went off it so did my results. If you want longterm healthy growth go protein.|`|AsDMUcciaa	Whey protein is just food. There is some benefit to consuming a little bit of carbs and protein soon after a workout, but it doesn't matter where they come from. A banana and a piece of meat are really just as effective as a protein shake with fruit juice mixed in. I'm a lazy cook, so I enjoy having it handy, but there isn't anything special about it. As for price, the only real difference between the cheap and expensive stuff is how well it mixes (clumps...), taste and any additions (carbs, fat, etc). The protein is essentially the same (yes, the package lies). I've used a bunch and finally settled on Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey; not because it works better, it just mixes well even without a blender and actually tastes *good*.<br>  <br>  Creatine is a toss up. Some studies say it's useless, others say it helps. Some people find it works, others find it makes them nauseous. I've tried a few different products, can't really say it made a difference for me, but it's something you'd have to decide for yourself. Go with one that contains 'creatine monohydrate'. Cheaper than some other forms, just as effective. The variety or mix doesn't matter: creatine is creatine. Weber Naturals makes a good generic one.<br>  <br>  Some people have a hard on for 'mass gainer' products, but generally I've found they're overrated. Mostly fat, carbs and various vitamins and such to promote recovery and growth. If your sole desire is to consume 1000 calories in powder form, go for it. Food works just fine for me.<br>  <br>  The only other kind I've found useful are pre-workout mixes. Superpump 250, Black powder, etc. These tend to contain creatine, arginine (precursor to nitric oxide, supposed to promote blood flow to muscle tissue) and a crap load of stimulants (caffeine, etc). Not essential by any means, but handy for keeping focused and energized through a long workout.<br>  <br>  One last suggestion: take a daily generic multivitamin. Cheap, easy and covers the majority of things you might be missing in your diet. Hope this helps.

AcB0MXzqaa	I have PCOS, and I was in the same boat as you. I didn't want to take BC or any other medications, etc. I wanted to do it naturally. I was DX Sept 07 and I started a diet that week that I've been doing ever since. I do a Low Glycemic diet. I don't know if you have weight to loose or not but regardless this is a great diet for women with PCOS. This diet has been my savior! I have no more symptoms of PCOS (other than the hair that I will have to have lasered) and I have lost 83 lbs. I have a regular cycle and ovulate every month. Doing it naturally was definately for me.. I didn't see any other way being an option. Refer to the website www.soulcysters.com, it's for women with PCOS and a GREAT great website!! Also, I am here for whatever questions you may have...<br>  <br>  As for as medications they will suggest to you.. they may suggest BC or Metformin, Clomid, etc. As I have mentioned The Low Glycemic diet has worked great for me, and I have better results than most with doing it natually and not putting all of those medications (with LOTS of side effects) in my body.|`|e10145206558a469d6cadbb39d7f5d1caa	don't get pregnant until after treatment.

GcWRPLd6aa	it's not good for you to go without the hormones one day then a double dose the next. I would try to find little reminders to help you remember, set it right next to you're bed at night to remember to take, or carry it around with you in your purse.<br>  <br>  if you don't have the regular dosing the BC will be less effective about keeping you regular or preventing acne.|`|ldXSIWEyaa	i take yaz also. the biggest risk of doing that is pregnancy, but if your not having sex, there should be no worries. the most pills i have taken in one day is 3, which i dont recommend, but it did not make me feel sick. taking 2 pills a day is fine to catch up. but if it is happening alot, it might make your period late or even early. maybe some blood spotting during the month. which is no health concern, its just your system is readjusting to the pills. just try and remember, maybe set your alarm on your cell phone or make a ritual like take them after u brush your teeth in the morning, because everyone remembers to brush their teeth. it doesnt have to be the EXACT same time everyday, so as long as you remember it will be fine

AA10551261	Is your period coming? I know when my period is about to come I pee gallons... or it could be a UTI.|`|oRMEtsJwaa	I would go to that teacher after class one day in private and explain what's going on. Teachers are human and aren't inherently mean, just sometimes jaded from students using this as a game. Your teacher will most likely from then on understand. You should go see a doctor though. It's never good to hold yourself too long and if there is a change you may want to get checked out. Not all infections have all the symptoms and it doesn't hurt to get checked out. It can hurt to not get checked out and end up with your problem getting worse. |`|AA12317147	Ha - I just know it - prostrate check is indicated.<br>  <br>  I do not know if you are a man or a woman. Rebekkah does not necessarily mean you are a woman LOL. It is only a screen handle. <br>  <br>  Prostrate problems occur in men over 40 or 50. If left untreated, symptom of cancer is indicated.<br>  <br>  In women, it is usually a urinary tract problem - could be early sign of something extraordinary. <br>  <br>  Golden rule - Anything out of the ordinary needs to be examined closely. Your body is telling you something. You better pay attention to it. <br>  <br>  In either case, men or woman, urine or stools are the only way the professionals can determine the state of your body. Blood tests also indicate what is going on.
DlUncCiSaa	If you look in the vitamin aisle at many supermarkets/drug stores, there is a product called Viactive  that are multivitamins designed for adults, and they are chewable squares. They have the same texture as caramels or other soft candy, and come in multiple chocolate flavors (milk/dark chocolate/etc) as well as a few others I think. Your selection may vary depending on the store you are in, but I have found these to be helpful for me because I have a hard time swallowing vitamins, they are usually so much bigger then normal pills! They don't taste EXACTLY like a candy would, I have noticed that they leave a very very slight aftertaste in my mouth, but nothing a drink of water doesnt wash away. They do taste pretty good actually, depending on the flavor you choose!<br>  <br>  You can check them out at <a href="http://www.viactiv.com/index.jhtml," rel="nofollow">http://www.viactiv.com/index.jhtml,</a> and the site may be able to give you a store in your area that sells their products. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QsbB6vkoaa	you can find them at any pharmacy.<br>  also try an herbal store and ask the sales people to help you choose the best ones for you.<br>  i think they have different flavors and if not search online to find more options.
0K19d8Wxaa	well you could of brused the bone that might be why it is so swollen i amgoing to be a doctor so i know about this stuff. you could of also ripped some of the tissu between the 3 parts of the knee. what happens when you rip the tissue is your knee bones can rub together so they could be causing you pain also to look at what you could of done is there is this website and you can do virtual surgery and it gives you facts and it helps and it is really good, it is called<br>  www.edheads.com i use it alot to look at what could happen if you hut yourself. i hope i helped and also see a doctor and i hope your knee feels wayyyyyyy better !|`|1c426fb438efad05188bef334712684baa	You need to see a doctor right away to have an x-ray to rule out any breaks. Most likely it is a severe bruising of the bone(s) and possibly a fractured knee cap or bad sprain and maybe even all the above. Keep it elevated and put an ice pack on it in 15 minute intervals until you can get to the doctor. Ibuprofen will help with the pain and swelling, but only take if you are certain that you are not allergic. It is important to take care of this properly as you are young and your bones are still growing. Damage at a young age can come back to hurt you when you're older so please make sure you get to a doctor to be checked and treated.|`|NymG89OTaa	being totally honest you just bruised it really, really bad. You should ice it as much as possible and go easy on it/stay off it for a while to prevent furthur injury. If it is painful for an extremely long amount of time and doesnt seem to be getting better at all, see a doctor because you possibly could of fractured something, but is is not likely. Your best bet is to treat is like any other bruise or bump and hope for the best. hope this helps. |`|jHDWw9F5aa	Go see a Doctor<br>  You could have dislocaket your knee or fractured the bone or even ripped a muscle in your leg so go ask someone who will know.<br>  Doctor!|`|2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	Take some Motrin (about 800 mg for the first dose, 200mg afterwards).  If the swelling and pain don't go down after a day, go see a doctor.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	It's time to convince you parent is time to see your health care provider as soon as possible or go to your school clinic.<br>  Home treatment: Apply an ice pack, enclosed in a plastic bag or towel, for at least 30 minutes to minimize swelling. if there is more than slight swelling or pain despite the fact that the knee was immediately rested and ice was applied, see the doctor. If this isn't the case, apply the ice treatment on the knee for 30 minutes and than off for 15 minutes for the next several hours. Limited weight-bearing may be attempted during this time with a close watch for increased swelling and pain.<br>  Heat can be applied after 24 hours. By then, the knee should look and feel relatively normal; after 72 hours this should clearly be the case. Remember, however, that a strain or sprain isn't completely healed for four to six weeks and requires protection during this healing period. Elastic bandages won't prevent reinjury but will ease symptoms a bit and remind the injured person to be careful with the knee. And good luck.|`|oojO4WAraa	It is just bruised badly.  Put ice on it and take some ibuprophen or aspirin or Aleve and it should be better in a few days.|`|Nq5tE1h0aa	well because its bruised and hot, i would guess you could have bruised the bone itself, or fractured your knee cap. the worst possible scenario is a broken kneecap. <br>  <br>  fell better:)|`|XOT9rHPMaa	I did this a year ago.

LqqOCYu1aa	If your boyfriend's movements seems to come after meals or if he has bloating, cramps or gas, he may have Irritable Bowl Syndrome. This condition can hit anyone at anytime in their life. It may be due to stress or a reaction to certain foods. Primarily, IBS is a nutritional problem that can be corrected.<br>  <br>  Food senitivity can be from wheat, rye, barley, chocolate, milk products, meats, alcohol, drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or colas (this is just a small list.) A person can become sensitive to more than one type of food,<br>  <br>  In order for him to be sure, he needs to stop eating ALL of these foods for several days to give his colon a rest, then reintroduce them one at a time to see what triggers the reaction. When he finds his trigger, I suggest he no long eats it in order to have a calm colon. If this does not help, then he needs to seek help from a professional.<br>  <br>  You can research the internest on IBS for more info. Hope this helps.

If someone with mono sneezes in your face, you could get it.<br>  <br>  My sister had it and they kept testing me for it because I would sometimes drink after her.<br>  <br>  They just call it a kissing disease because it often hits teenagers and can be passed by kissing.|`|QLopvWKDaa	Yes- it is contacted through any close contact.  So sharing a soda or eating utensils,laughing or coughing closely etc can spread mono.<br>  <br>  Also, low defenses or weak immune system can also leave you more able to get it. Sleep well, eat right, drink lots of water and wash your hands frequently-oh! and exercise!  These things all help<br>  <br>  My daughter got mono at 9years old- I would tease her that she got from kissing her Backstreet Boys poster- of course she hated that!|`|1vF30nXIaa	yes by sharing something such as a glass, toothbrush, plate, food that the person who has mono.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	it is a virus spread like all others -direct contact with the infected body fluid.  wash your hands well.

aNlT1NRqaa	Any exercise is better than nothing, but you should exercise for 20 minutes or more for a better effect. Walking 2-3 miles a day is probably more effective & better for your knees than a 1 mile run. Cycling is one of the best calorie burning (no impact) activities. 1 hour on a bike can burn 600-1100 calories (depends how intense the ride). 3500 calories = 1 pound of weight.<br>  <br>  Eating fewer calories will make a bigger difference than exercise. An appetizer at a restaurant can be 1000-3000 calories! But it's more important what kind of calories you take in. Small snacks are OK, but should be low in fat and more fiber & protein.<br>  <br>  A good breakfast is fiber filled (steel cut oats with fruit - overnight in a slow cooker is delicious & easy) to fill you up & keep hunger away longer. Dinner should be the smallest meal, as you don't need energy to sleep. Cut out as much fat as you can & don't drink sodas & avoid extra sugar (like in your coffee).<br>  <br>  Also, be careful about how much weight you loose. Too skinny can be as bad for your health as too fat. You don't want to "diet". This should be a lifestyle change, otherwise you'll gain the weight back as soon as the diet ends.|`|fTztIC22aa	Alright, well since you want to lose weight I'd suggest doing HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) instead of running a mile everyday and you don't need to do a mile and elipticals. You will lose weight if and only if your diet is in check eat healthy and eat 6 meals a day. You should see results on the scale within a week, and results in the mirror within 2-4weeks.<br>  Link to HIIT (it explains it and gives sample routines)<br>  <a href="http://www.intervaltraining.net/hiit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.intervaltraining.net/hiit.htm...</a>

Or use tissue.<br>  The reason why you dribbled is because you stopped momentarily.  The strength of ejaculation is dependent on the contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscles.  This is what causes the squirting of semen.  When you stop you relax your muscles momentarily and the contractions become weaker and the emission becomes less forceful.|`|NohBRVp6aa	its normal. not everyone squirts. it depends on the guy. if you need someone helpful to talk to instant message me. i will help if i can and i am sending you a message. good luck.|`|cr9W3vtjaa	contrary to popular belief it rarely shoots out with the velocity of a firehouse...<br>  <br>  dribbles are normal, and little squirt squirt is normal too...|`|7UMsL8D3aa	Yeah, thats about right.

If he was breathless I would be thinking COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- very common in smokers).  <br>  <br>  If he is on any medications, such as ACE inhibitor for high blood pressure they can cause cough as a side effect. <br>  <br>  If it were an infection or bronchiectstasis i would expect him to be bringing something up, so it cant be that. <br>  <br>  I doubt it's hayfever, it's a bit random for it to occur now. If there is a family history of hayfever+/asthma it might be more likely.  <br>  <br>  My only other thought is something more serious but your dad is pretty young for that. If he was a very heavy smoker though i'd be worried about cancer. <br>  <br>  The telescope thing is called a bronchoscopy and it's a tube with a camera on the end which will be inserted into the windpipe and a little ways into the bronchus of the lungs. This may find things which xray missed. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. I'm sure everything will be fine.|`|msNEnin6aa	i thought telescopes were for looking at outer space not down peoples throats
AA10975447	Chickens harbor Salmonella in their bodies. The bacteria permeate the egg, including the shell, the whites and the yolks. It doesn't harm the embryo, but it does incorporate into the chicken. <br>  <br>  Some states (namely California!!!) actually vaccinate chickens against Salmonella. This helps cut down on the number of egg-related outbreaks. However California doesn't produce enough eggs to supply itself (and will be producing even less, thanks to the passage of Prop 2), so we rely on eggs from other states and Mexico. These out-of-California eggs have been suggested as the source of a few of the egg outbreaks.<br>  <br>  Washing the shells doesn't work. Your best bet is to use a pasteurized egg product (many well-equipped supermarkets carry them). There are pasteurized shell eggs you can buy, too, but these are more expensive than the carton products.|`|WTwMFC7saa	Salmonella gets in there from the chicken and/or environment. Chicken lays eggs from the same place it pee/poos from. Chickens do coat their eggs with antimicrobial coating when they lay them, but it's not a guarantee, but it does keep the eggs well for that 21 day chick incubation. When we wash the eggs off, we wash away that protective coating. Microbes can then infect the eggs again. TADA! Salmonella. Chickens for some reason are more prone to this, forgot why. I think it's more prevalent in their feces.<br>  You know, it's better safe than sorry and better to cook the little devils first. Store bought egg nog with be pasturized, which means it had been subjected to heat to kill the bacteria, which is a good thing. Salmonella is nasty and tenatious bacterium.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Don't take the risk with raw eggs.<br>  <br>  Although some chickens may become vaccinated, you have no clue which ones are.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can buy pasteurized eggs (still in the egg form) and that would be the ideal alternative to raw unpasteurized eggs for your food choices.Washing the shell wouldn't still not guarantee that you would be salmonella free.Salmonella can still be inside the egg.<br>  <br>  Google "pasteurized eggs" and the products should come up for you to check in your grocery store.
WTwMFC7saa	700 calories is very little food; you better becareful. Since you are a midget, make one of your meals Ensure or Glycerna. Eat more fruits and vegies and make your proteins LEAN. Rabbit is the leanest meat I know of. Eat only white meat of chicken.<br>  I'd think more about more exercise rather than cutting calories. Exam your calories daily very closely. Take QUALITY vitamins.<br>  Some people are just not meant to be skinny skinny. Careful, high quality diet that's balanced with proper exercise recommended by experts is the only way to correct your metabolism, if it's possible.|`|z3A8meCNaa	700 calories is waay too little.  700 calories falls into the anerexic caloric intake.  The average body needs around 2200 calories.  It may be that you are too little for your body size if you can only have 1000 calories to maintain your weight.  Every body has a set weight where it is healthy, which is why the charts are so useless.  Don't judge yourself by them!  I've been struggling with an eating disorder for 2 years (just started treatment) all my ribs show my hip bones stand out, basically i'm too bony and i ate so little it put a strain on my heart so I'm at risk for cardiac arest at 15.  Go to a dietician.  She can help you. =)|`|3rvsG372aa	That confirms what I've seen before.

3059c69d713a3b3f99a4757099599918aa	Well to actually answer your question, no Grapefruit doesn't help you lose weight, but Celery, Mustard, Cucumbers, and pickles all take more calories to eat than your body gets. That means eating those 4 things you will actually burn calories, those are all the foods I know though. Goodluck enjoy.|`|RnHDnSgPaa	yes it does<br>  <br>  because your body takes my energy to break down the grapefruit,<br>  and doing this uses more calories then it does to eat it!<br>  <br>  also viniger does this and red wine|`|Wkosntqgaa	no, you gain calories from everything you eat|`|IIpEaDCcaa	No foods can make you lose weight or calories. That's impossible.|`|Nr2yLe1faa	Eating anything isn't going to help you lose calories unless you use it as a replacement for other foods. It has a lot less calories than most things, so in theory the more grapefruit you ate, the less other food you would eat, the thinner you would get. Remember 3000 calories = 1 lb of weight. So try to make a plan and lose a couple pounds a month by substituting foods like you just listed.|`|Sjc7orQtaa	The pattern for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and exercise more - the problems appear when we actually try to put that into operation! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?!

What he said was this:  think about everything that you eat, and try to imagine your one worst eating habit.  Avoid that one thing.  Grapefruits are good for you, don't misunderstand.<br>  <br>  I a nurse who lost weight and quite a bit, by greatly upping his water intake.  I saw the difference in him.  He told me that if you drink enough water to pee clear you would loose weight and he was proof of that.  This is an emergency room nurse.

WTwMFC7saa	Supply and demand. Increase demand, supply goes down, price goes up. Keep demand up, even if supply is readily available, and price stays up. Price will stay whereever economy bares. If demand drops, supply increases, price will drop. Soda is getting out of favor with the health, yuppies, conscientious freaks and water is in vogue, so that's why water is more expensive. Keeping soda cheap is government's way of helping the poor, and yes, demand goes down.

DsEEATKSaa	As mental health professionals, part of our work is preventative, rather than tertiary. The psychological sequalae of childhood sexual abuse is often profound, far reaching, and intractable. If we can PREVENT it from occurring (or lessen the severity by, for example, ordering an ivestigation of a suspected incident of abuse early on), then we may have had a hand in preventing the future (as in into adulthood) mental anguish of not just the one, but perhaps many children.

Remember that for someone to have any clinical symptoms of TB osteomyelitis their infection MUST have been present for 6 months or longer - probably years in most cases.<br>  <br>  If you have a strep or staph infection on a bone for 6 months - the bones are incredibly hypertrophied and moth-eaten .  A typical diabetic foot infection left untreated for that long will present with a toe that looks like a huge sausage.<br>  <br>  So it's not anything special about the mycobacterium, just the fact that the infection has been present for so long prior to diagnosis.

K26ec4kLaa	I hope you did not give him aspirin for his temp when he had the measles.  It can cause Reye's Syndrome.  I would take him back to the doctor if you haven't already.  To lower his temp, give him tylenol but no aspirin. A wet cloth with cool water on his forehead and arms will help reduce the temp.. If it's extremely high, soaking him in a tepid (lukewarm) tub can also help.  but check with the doctor if he has a very high temp.  He does need to rest and drink plenty of fluids.  Not ice cold, again, slightly cool..Since he had the measles, his body immune system may be down a bit and he may of picked up some other bug.  Hope he feels better soon.. Hang in there :-)|`|JMN6yNLPaa	Doctor.<br>  <br>  It could be serious.|`|o8Xfn2bfaa	Have you given him any tylenol or Motrin? Giving him cool compresses to put on his head may help a little. I would stick with the fever reducers though, and if it's still there even after you give him those I would contact hes pediatrician, it could mean something more is going on.

It looks kinda gay, but then so does this site!|`|AA10261787	well your well on your way but eating very little during the day is really not the answer. You have to eat small meals about 6 times a day to keep your metabolism high. When you only eat a little during the day your body automatically thinks its starving and will store the food as fat. There are very cheap methods for having 6 meals a day. Oatmeal is very cheap and easy to prepare. Doesn't taste very good but it does the trick lol. If you combine 6 meals a day with some cardio (doesn't need to be anything fancy running, jumprope, really anything that gets your heart beating hard) you should be well on your way to seeing your abs

eK4ZeR6Yaa	I usually shave at the end of my shower or bath, I think it softens the hair and makes it more comfortable to shave. Shave with the grain to begin with and don't shave over the same area too many times or you will get razor burn. Definately use a shave gel, lotion, or cream. I would be careful shaving too close to the lip area, it might be best to visit a wax technician if you want that much gone.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	I shave in the bath... definitely trim before you shave... and yes, you should remove any stray hairs that are on the lips... basically just grasp one side with one hand and pull the skin taut....and run the razor carefully over the edge of the lip and you will easily remove the hair without any damage. LOL.  Then repeat on the other side.  <br>  <br>  Believe it or not--I use hair conditioner to shave my legs and bikini line instead of some sort of shaving cream.<br>  <br>  It's not such a weird question--just a bit embarrassing is all...|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	Make sure you have a new razor, I prefer to shave during the shower. Trim first, then apply shaving cream (I like Aveeno), shave with the growth not against. Yes, you can shave the lips as well. Be careful and take your time.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	You're going to have to be careful on this one. The first few times you shave it's going to be extremely itchy when it grows back or your skin will be irritated...after a while it'll still be itchy but not as bad once you've gotten used to shaving. If I were you, I'd take a nice hot bath/shower and do shaving last so that the hair would have a chance to be softened up and be easier to shave. Be generous with the amount of shaving cream (use a good amount) so that it would be easy to shave, use a sharp clean razor (not a dull one), and be really careful. You can have a chance to get ingrown hairs too if you don't do it right...|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Get a new razor, lather really well with women's shaving gel. Shave in small moves going the way the hair grows ( going against the hair growth makes it sore) shave all hair even if its on lips, it doesn't matter. Try to do it when you don't have to wear tight jeans or clothes for a few hrs as it rubs and makes it sore. In the shower is easiest. Some say put lots of cream on after but that makes no difference to me tho it may for you.|`|NNwEuC8paa	It is ok to shave the hole thing! do it girl!

Hope this helps, Feel Better =) =)|`|AA11307468	Baking soda in water, crackers, dry toast...|`|dhlSrrMwaa	You could try a chamomile tea. My mom used to give it to me when I was little and got a nervous stomach ache before a big event.
uJKTR4d2aa	There are lots of vegan substitutes. Switch to vegetarian first. Or eat meat once a week or something so you can transition instead of a big WHALOOP lol. <br>  <br>  I became veg for 3 years once. I watched "Meet your meat" by peta2. i stopped right then and there.<br>  <br>  Go buy fake meats from the freezer section they have hot dogs hamburgers pizza chicken nuggets and everything else, all meat free. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Thats the best life style i ever lived. I hope i can have the will power to go back to it
d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I am taking the same stuff. My doc said not to drink while on Xanax. A .25mg Xanax will do it's job for up to 6 hours and generally be out of your system in 12. I usually take a Xanax on Thursday and then drink on Friday and never had a problem. You really shouldn't worry, it's not going to hurt you.|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	If you don't give the Xanax 12 or so hours to leave your system, either abstain from drinking or drink very little--otherwise you'll become nauseous and might black out. Wait a day--if you drink now, it'll have been at least 24 hrs and you'll be fine. But since you're on Zoloft, be careful about drinking, because that can have the same effect.
0MODZ0Iwaa	Yes- when you don't eat for over 5 hours your body's metabolism slows down- this is because your body goes into something called "starvation mode." At the beginning of human existence, people had to survive off of small amounts of food and their bodies stored fat due to an expected "famine," you could say. When you deprive your body of food, it doesn't know where its next meal is coming from.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Skipping any meal could result in a slower metabolism. Eat something for dinner even if it small. <br>  <br>  You are better off eating five or six small meals a day.|`|A0lSFMNbaa	Yes,<br>  it is recommended to eat 5-6 small meals a day.<br>  This will increase your metabolism.
vcRm8ps8aa	you might have PCOS (poly systic ovary syndrome). This can cause periods to go strange and be very late. I was the most regular girl, but one time i had a period on 3rd december, and didnt get another one until feb 13th! i went to the doctors and he sent me to the hospital for a scan and i found out yesterday i have PCOS.|`|b1XStRqtaa	Check with your GYN again. Every year I go they ask me when my last period was.  They should have asked you and then when you told them about not having it for a few months they should have discussed it with you.  You were on the pill for 10 years. Those things can really mess you up.  What's scary is that since they are not regular anymore, the pregnancy issue is something to be aware of.|`|tPDkIJlZaa	Yes its normal =) you are just having irregular periods =) No worries i used to have a normal period every month and now im 20 and sometimes they skipp its sacary but its normal.|`|l270f5SWaa	do you have a cyst?|`|3WcCeOqdaa	You should always feel that you can ask your doctor about these things, especially during a related check-up.<br>  <br>  I was on the Pill from age 22 to about 32 or so.  I went on Depo-Provera shots for about 2 years until I read that it has bad side effects.  I have been with my husband a long time (since age 24) but we didn't get married until I was 35.  At that time he told me (since we didn't plan to have children of our own) to get off the birth control and he'd get a vasectomy - fantastic!<br>  <br>  So I did.  It took a few months before I started to get my period again and another few before it was regular again.  At this point (3+ years later) I get my period around every 28 days.  It's great not being on birth control.  I realize that is not an option for a lot of women and probably not the best option for many either but with my unique situation it works.<br>  <br>  Everything is probably very normal.  Hormones can do a number of things to our bodies and they may take a while to get out of our systems entirely.  I would track when you bleed for the next few months then see your doctor with those results.  Maybe you'll be more regular by then but if not you'll have some history to show your doctor to discuss it and hopefully find some answers.
o8Xfn2bfaa	It's very hard to say but from your symptoms it sounds like they might do a throat swab, which isnt painful. If the doctor is not sure but suspects it is something bacterial, he may do a blood test to find out what it is. But usually they start with a throat swab to see if it is negative or positive. You shouldnt get any shots unless they feel it necessary enough to give you a shot of antibiotics, but that is usually last resort.|`|AA11770886	There is a saying- "Penny Wise and pound foolish". You are afraid of a small prick and are prepared to suffer more pain due to sore throat !!!<br>  There is antibacterial Strepsils available now. Take that three or four times a day. it cures.  Simultaneously, Gargle hot saline water three or four times a day. it will cure your sore throat. You can also use a throat swab of Gentian Violet ( Old day's remedy ) It will look dirty. Better go to a doctor because it can be due to some other problem. So better consult an ENT Specialist.

A medical doctor should be consulted as everyone is unique and has different symptoms and different remedies/cures/treatment. Not many medical doctors answer questions on Yahoo Answers, in my opinion you<br>  may be risking your health if you wait for an answer here. Please ask your parents to take you to a doctor or clinic. Good luck.|`|gL3FNtwuaa	Go to your MD if ur really worried.. But if it feels like "the commom cold"... icrease intake of Vitamin C to 1-4 g/day and get some zinc lozenges.<br>  <br>  Since u aso have chest congestion I would go to pharmacist and have them recmmend a cough expectorant ie:Robitussin<br>  <br>  If symp continues for 2+ days DEF go to MD|`|d18cbae46f193dec81262fc5349b2669aa	Go to the doctors ,look after yourself"Take-Care!
TsjqzanQaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Sitting, have your arm lying on your thigh, with the back of the arm on the thigh.<br>  <br>  Have your wrist just over the knee, and take a dumbell and do wrist curls.     This strengthens the wrist and should make it more muscular with time.

hrK5ajDHaa	Ideal weight for you is between 130.5 and 159.5 based on your height.<br>  <br>  If you tell me your age, physical activity level, and desired weight I can calculate how many calories you need to consume.<br>  <br>  To lose weight<br>  Participate in 60 to 90 minutes of daily moderate intensity physical activity. Do not exceed your caloric intake.<br>  <br>  Consume 2 cups of fruit daily<br>  Consume 2.5 cups of vegetables daily<br>  Consume 3 or more ounce-equivalents of whole-grain products per day. The rest of the grains should come from enriched or whole-grain products<br>  <br>  Keep your saturated and trans fats low. Your fats should come from polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oil.<br>  <br>  Choose lean, low-fat, fat free products when selecting meat, milk, milk products and etc.<br>  <br>  Avoid/Reduce sodas and alcoholic beverages.<br>  <br>  Consume less than 2300 mg of salt daily.<br>  <br>  Choos foods that have little added sugars or caloric sweeteners.|`|AA10261787	well I am really not sure on your ideal weight but you could google it. However, for lunch you really should not be eating ANY frozen foods as these contain high amounts of salt. Salt not only can give you high blood pressure but also traps water subcutaneously which makes you look bloated. Also, have you been drinking water? Drink at least a gallon of water a day (this may seem like a paradox if you drink more water won't more water get trapped subcutaneously? But in fact this is absolutely untrue. Drinking more water flushes all the subcutaneous water out of your system and within a week you will look a lot more cut. Also adequate exercise whether it be running, weight training, yoga etc...) can be extremely helpful in dropping unwanted pounds. If you follow these guidelines you should be well on your way to dropping those unwanted pounds.|`|HBx6q05Oaa	Women get 105 lbs for the first five feet and 5 lbs per inch +/- 10%based on body build so your IBW would be 135-165 lbs.|`|c4sn6g3xaa	I am assuming you are a girl - if so, it is a bit too much.

Jo7tUlpNaa	I highly doubt that damaging your skin with UV rays will help. <br>  It's probably just acne. I know it sounds gross but it's really common. See a dermatologist and he or she will recommend you some medication. Probably a gel or something...<br>  If you can't get into a doctor, buy a body wash that contains salicylic acid. It's the best killer of little pimples. I recommend Neutrogena.  |`|0dZ2qW8paa	Proactiv is a good skin product, I have been using it for almost 2 years and it has helped out my skin a lot.

I'm the same height as you and weigh a bit more than that. Women our height should weigh between 114 and 144, you are in the middle and look great I'm sure of it! I think you are feeling fat because you know you haven't done any exercise lately and should be. Even if you can just get out and walk for 10-15 min will make you feel better, go to the mall, do something outdoors, It will make you feel much better.<br>  Get out and have FUN!!
7pl5QLqCaa	I bet they both would work about the same. Salt water would be more cost effective though.<br>  <br>  I am glad that they are recommending this now. I Took Advair when it first came out and was never told to rinse my mouth. I ended up with a very hoarse voice to the point I decided to stop using the medication. So don't get lazy about rinsing your mouth, it can do unpleasant things. |`|jUan5MSjaa	The saltwater is the easiest, cheapest and simplest, but any rinse will work.  The objective is to rid your mouth of the Fluticasone which is the ingredient in Advair that causes the thrash, hoarseness and other irritating problems within the mouth.  I use Flovent, which is Fluticasone only, and I use a saltwater or mouthwash rinse to clear my mouth of the powdery Fluticasone that's left behind.
vtgVnCijaa	You can not target fat loss on your thighs the key is diet diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  You need to eat 5-6 small meals a day. Eat some protein with each meal! Cut out all refined sugar!!! Also add more fiber. The fiber and protein will fill you up, helping you to cut down on your unhealthy eating. Also by eating more than 3 meals spread out through the day you will kick your metabolism in high gear. Here is a general meal for a day:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: 2 poached eggs<br>  whole wheat toast<br>  1/2 cup fruit<br>  <br>  Snack: Cottage Cheese with veggie<br>  <br>  Lunch: Turkey, lettuce, tomato, whole wheat bread sandwich<br>  1/2 cup fruit<br>  <br>  Snack: Protein Shake<br>  <br>  Dinner: Turkey Burger ( no bun )<br>  Side of brown rice<br>  Side of Broc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Then exercise regularly 4-5 days a week. Do both cardio and lifting. But on days that you do both. Do lifting before your cardio and you will maximize your fat burn. Cardio can be a sport: basketball, soccer, football, anything with losts of movement. Golf is a no no.<br>  <br>  So Example :<br>  <br>  Monday - 30 mins lifting then 1 hr cardio<br>  Tuesday - 1 hour lifting<br>  Wednesday - Rest<br>  Thrusday - 30 mins lifting then 1 hr cardio<br>  Friday - 1 hour lifting<br>  Saturday - Rest<br>  Sunday - 30 mins lifting then 1 hr cardio<br>  <br>  For exercises check out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xercisefactor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.xercisefactor.com</a><br>  <br>  They have hundreds of exercise video clips<br>  <br>  Also check out the XGen to randomly generate a workout routine. You have to sign up, but it is free.|`|AA10846378	Running|`|kcEhPEeDaa	Well, eat healthy.  WATCH THE CARBS.  Eat high protein, high fiber.  The South Beach diet works well, but you really have to commit.  And you don't have to be super intense about it...as in, eating a bit of rice or a piece of toast here and there isn't a sin.  You just want to avoid eating waffles with syrup for breakfast, a sandwich with three inch pieces of bread for lunch, and macaroni and cheese for dinner.  <br>  Exercise.  Not necessarily lifting weights, but more of running and biking and wall-sits and the like.  Running is very good for basically everything...legs, lungs, heart...  But if you have bad knees, be careful.  That's about the only danger there.
BMxDeEMcaa	Walking is really good for you and just healthy fresh fruits and veggies. Good luck!|`|mhcKr58Aaa	Try to get more information on dieting, weight loss articles, health and fitness articles, weight loss forum and BMI calculator at my profile and get the advice from them to lose weight fast and healthy.|`|yAEyqGmCaa	Everyone's body is different and reacts differently to different foods and methods.  I can suggest a few things though:<br>  <br>  Decrease your portion sizes and eat 3 square meals a day.  Make sure that everything you eat is nutrient dense (has lots of nutrients).  Yeah sure, you can eat pizza but it's going to have much more nutrients if you get it with veggies.  Most importantly I try to remember to get all my fruits and veggies in because I'm not a big fan of them and they are hard to keep.  Watch it with the fruits though, you can get too much sugar from eating fruits, believe it or not.  Don't eat unless you're hungry, and stop eating if you are.  for this one you gotta become pretty observant of your own body and what it's telling you.  Drink lots of water every day.  Limit your salt intake.  When you do look at calories be a bit more concerned with the fat calories.  Something can have only 100 calories, but if 90 of that is fat calories then you would be much better off eating something with 300 calories and 40 fat cals.<br>  I only eat 3 meals a day because it takes time to digest food and I like to give it about 3 hours.  I know a lot of people who eat 6 small meals a day but I don't possibly know how they can get that hungry that fast.  If you do decide to do that though then keep 3 hours between meals still.<br>  Some people keep food journals to help them out.  It really is nice to be able to see what you're eating.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like as much when you just eat it, but when it's in black and white you change your mind.  I kept one for a while but I had to stop because it was making me dwell on my next meal way too much.  I would sit and think about what I was going to eat, my possibilities, and by the time it came around I just ate junk food.<br>  Also, buy yourself a good scale.  If it's electronic then keep it away from water.  Electronic scales are really nice because you can see your progress by the tenth of a pound even, but if they break and still read you may be fooled into thinking you have lost a lot of weight or become very frustrated because you appear to have lost weight but it's not saying so.  Some people say you should weigh yourself once a week, I prefer every day so I can see my progress and have a better idea of how different foods and portion sizes affect me.|`|4ZZvpzBIaa	Here are some ideas that have helped me.<br>  Try to be more active at first.  <br>  Drink a lot of water, by first trying to have a glass at night then in the morning (as soon as you get up).  <br>  Have small sips of water all day to get you use to drinking water.<br>  Don't let yourself be hungry.  Carry around with you fruit or yogurt.  <br>  If you get a crave for something you know you should not have, have a small portion.  <br>  It's all about the proportion.|`|IyiLEzbLaa	eat healthy foods with low fat and low saturated fats<br>  <br>  do lots of cardio exercises for at least 20-25 minutes at a time<br>  stuff like that|`|M4iKbxpYaa	I found this on this website.

oj4qBa7waa	Unless you are currently taken a hormone type birth control (like the pill) there really isn't a designated way to delay your period.  I've heard all types of wise tales from sucking on a lemon to taking mass quanities of B12, but none have been proven to work or even be safe for that matter.<br>  <br>  If you are taken birth control, you can skip your last week pills and start a new pack.

Se presentan en forma de pastillas o cápsulas de diferente forma y color. pueden ser legales si son consumidas bajo un estricto control médico, sin embargo, el abuso de las mismas se produce cuando son adquiridas y consumidas de manera ilícita. Su consumo produce sensaciones de alerta, confianza y aumenta los niveles de energía y autoestima. Hace desaparecer la sensación de hambre (peligrosamente son utilizadas para bajar de peso) e inhiben el sue?o. Los síntomas físicos son: Aumenta el estado de alerta.  Comportamiento agresivo y violento. Aumento de energía y actividad motora. Sensación de bienestar. Aumento en la seguridad y confianza. Disminuye el sue?o. Disminuye la fatiga. Aumenta la velocidad de pensamiento y lenguaje. Se suprime la sensación de apetito.  Aumento en la presión arterial.  Aumento en la frecuencia cardiaca. Aumento en la temperatura corporal. Estimulación de la corteza cerebral. Desincronización en el Electro Encefalograma (E.E.G.) Disminución del sue?o.<br>  <br>  La metanfetamina está clasificada como un sicoestimulante al igual que otras drogas de abuso, como son la anfetamina y la cocaína. Sabemos que la estructura de la metanfetamina es similar a la anfetamina y el neurotransmisor dopamina pero que es muy diferente a la cocaína. Aunque estos estimulantes tienen efectos similares hacia el comportamiento y la fisiología, hay grandes diferencias en los mecanismos básicos de cómo trabajan al nivel celular del sistema nervioso. Sin embargo, la conclusión es que el resultado de la metanfetamina, tal como la cocaína, es la acumulación del neurotransmisor dopamina y esta concentración excesiva de la dopamina es la que aparentemente produce la estimulación y sensación de euforia que siente el usuario. En contraste a la cocaína, la cual se elimina rápidamente y es casi metabolizada por completo en el cuerpo, la metanfetamina tiene una duración de acción mucho más larga y un porcentaje mayor de la droga permanece sin cambiar en el cuerpo. El resultado es que la presencia de la metanfetamina en el cerebro dura más, lo cual finalmente conduce a la prolongación de los efectos estimulantes de la droga. a metanfetamina puede causar una variedad de problemas cardiovasculares. Estos incluyen latido acelerado o irregular del corazón, presión alta, y da?os irreversibles que pueden ocasionar derrames a los vasos sanguíneos del cerebro. La hipertermia (temperatura elevada del cuerpo) y convulsiones ocurren con sobredosis de la metanfetamina y si no se tratan inmediatamente pueden resultar fatales. El abuso crónico de la metanfetamina puede resultar en la inflamación de las paredes internas del corazón, y entre los usuarios que se inyectan la droga, da?o a los vasos sanguíneos y abscesos de la piel. Las personas que abusan de la metanfetamina también pueden tener episodios de conducta violenta, paranoia, ansiedad, confusión e insomnia. Las personas que usan la droga constantemente, demuestran deterioro progresivo en sus vidas sociales y ocupacionales. En algunos casos síntomas sicóticos pueden persistir por meses o a?os después de que se deja de usar la droga.<br>  <br>  El crack, es el nombre vulgar de un derivado de la cocaína, en concreto del resultado de hervir clorhidrato de cocaína en una solución de bicarbonato de sodio y evaporar el agua. Entre ellos se ubican la disminución de la potencia sexual, cefalea, enfermedad de Parkinson y hemorragia cerebral, da?os en el cerebro y pulmones (enfisema).

oRMEtsJwaa	you don't have to have babies just because you are a woman. I don't know how old you are, but it's ok to be a little scared to have your body change and go through something like pregnancy and birth. However women have been giving birth since man began. It's natural and we are made to be able to handle it. Medicine has only made it safer and safer as well. I know people talk about side effects and "bad" things, but you're not hearing the good things as well. I had a very difficult pregnancy and delivery, but I wouldn't change it for the world! I loved bonding to my child and the seeing her personality come through even inside me. It may not be something you can deal with right now, but that's fine when you are ready you'll feel peace. Remember every person in the world was born of a mother. <br>  <br>  btw- your ovaries don't bleed. If they did you would be very sick. Ovaries are where your eggs are made and then released down your fallopian tube to make it's way to your uterus. Maybe if you learned a bit more about your inner workings it would help calm your fears.|`|1AzO3ZkZaa	I THINK IF U R MARRIED TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND|`|drohnx6Raa	It's perfectly normal, don't worry! it's a scary, painful thing that many are afraid of. WOmen likethis, when they get older they may have a desire to have a child that they feel it's worth it to go through the pain. <br>  <br>  It could be that you have tocophobia, which is phobia of getting pregnant/giving birth. But there's really nothing wrong with you. <br>  <br>  You DON'T have to do anythign you don't want to. if you never want to give birth then you don't have to. If you want children you could adopt or foster. Or if you want kids naturally than you could have somethign called 'full surrogacy' where they would extract your egg and partners sperm, grow it in a test tube and implant it in another woman's body to carry it for you. <br>  <br>  When you get older, your fears may dissappear. If they don't then you can either look into getting therapy to get over the fear, or you can just look into different methods of having children like surrogacy. You don't have to carry a baby if you don't want to.|`|8HIfUoxyaa	Don't have sex and you won't get pregnant.

The docs had no clue what was up, come to find out it was Black Mold.  It could be hiding anywhere.  Also, do they have pets and are you unknowingly allergic?|`|0GsxUzPhaa	Do you have breathing problems?   It could be from mold. |`|3X7hF6ssaa	Hmm. I saw once on a medical show about how the last owners of an apartment spilled mercury or something, and the new owners could not see it but it was making their baby very sick.<br>  <br>  So try and find out isf there is something like that happening, or if there could possibly be something in the vents?|`|aYq9usPyaa	Just a hunch- but you may want to look into any prior water leaks the apartment may have had. Water can cause mold or mildew to form and grow often unseen (behind and in-between walls). Mold and mildew can cause people to feel exactly the way you are describing. Hope you feel better soon.|`|L50L3h77aa	carbon dioxide poisoning will make you feel ever weak and make you vomit. it could also be mold or something like mold maybe the people before you has a cat or something that you cant get out without a carpet cleaner? i'm not sure i would go see my DR again and ask about some blood work that would check for toxins ?

0wkSf58waa	I have taken Yaz for PMDD for 3 years and it is the very best birth control to treat PMDD. I have been on 4 different types of birth control since my PMDD was diagnosed and none have been this successful in treatment.|`|aL2N4SsIaa	I went to a department store and got estroven.  It is all natural and after a couple of weeks of using it things got much better, and there is a bonus, I started losing weight.  They say women's weight problems are usually from unbalanced hormones unless you  are someone that really, really overeats.  But if you quit taking the estroven you will be back to having PMDD and the weight will come back.  I used the estroven because birth control and synthetic estrogen makes my heart race so I had no choice but to use something else and it worked like a charm.  I was also impressed that it was all natural.  Less likely to have side effects.

If you are sexually active it increases the number of things that could be going on.  You need to make sure to be honest with your doctor.  If you don't want your parents to know what's going on, Just tell them You're irregular and a friend/school nurse someone told you that birth controls can help you become regular and you'd like to see a doctor about it.<br>  <br>  The possible causes are so vast, but here are some problems I know can cause long lapses in periods.<br>  Simple things like stress for one<br>  if you're over weight, it can effect the ability for blood flow<br>  More serious<br>  endometriosis (which is where menstrual blood collects on the walls of the uterus and are not released properly, usually does not stop a period completely but can really mess with your cycle)<br>  hormone imbalances<br>  There's just so many possibilities you really need to have it checked out.|`|k9Je9C6Yaa	It could be stress or bad nutrition.

Vz1n2Yv5aa	He has pneumothorax, a collapsed lung.  As for coghing blood, he has an infection in his lungs, possibly pneumonia, possibly tuberculosis.  Infection of the lungs results in scarring and in some cases, spontaneous pneumothorax.  There's nothing he can do to cure himself, he's going to need surgery unless he wants to sleep with the fishes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: What I wonder is how come after getting a chest X-ray, the doctors did not decide to send him to a hospital to get surgery immediately.  Pneumothorax is a life threatening emergency, and either the doctor was extremely incompetent, you heard them wrong, or he did in fact have him to go to get the operation, but ran away from the problem out of fear.  Get the surgery, there's nothing worse than dying.|`|qnD5RfbPaa	For starters, he needs to get on a vigorous diet of high antioxidant fruits and vegetables and see what happens from there.  These foods are all citrus fruits - orange, grapefruits, lemon limes, tangerines, etc, as well as grapes, pomegranates, asparagus, beet greens, cantaloupe, collards, dandelion greens, dulse, fish, legumes, lima beans, liver, mushrooms, pecans, oysters, pumpkin seeds, sardines, seafood, sunflower seeds, fish liver and fish liver oil, garlic, kale, mustard greens, papayas, peaches, pumpkin, red peppers, spirulina, spinach, sweet potatoes, swiss chard, turnip greens, watercress, brussels sprouts, kale, onions, green peas, persimmons, radishes, strawberries, tomatoes, cornmeal, , eggs, milk, passion fruits, meats, wheat, all green leafy vegetables, cabbage, broccoli, celery, parsley, carrots, pineapple, watercress and mangoes.<br>  <br>  All of the above that is available, he should be eating in large quantity.  Juices are very important for the slowing down or healing of defects.  Have several glasses of vegetable juices and fruit juices per day.  These should be freshly made from fresh raw fruits or raw vegetables.  Use a variety of fruit in each fruit juice and the same goes for the vegetable juice.  Include green leafy vegetables in vegetable juice.  Flavor vegetable juice with a little rind from lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit skin, along with ginger and the juice of lime or lemon.<br>  <br>  These foods will either heal him or slow down the deterioration.  He needs to start on them now.<br>  |`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	He can't.

Blood, unless it's from your period or a cut, is not a good sign...especially internal bleeding! It's a sign that something is wrong.

It really takes out the bad stuff in your system. It simply goes in and out of your body.<br>  <br>  Eat A LARGE LUNCH.<br>  <br>  Nah, not a medium lunch, a large lunch believe it or not. When you want to burn fat, you want to take off as many calories possible. When you consume a high caloric meal in the afternoon, you will have lot of time to burn it off before dinner.<br>  <br>  Eat a SMALL dinner. Small dinner<br>  <br>  Typical americans have LARGE, fancy dinners. What do you usually do after dinner? Would you seriously go out for a walk? No. You would probaly be in bed in a few hours..<br>  <br>  Oh, and do a 10 minute SLOW jog everyday. This will work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|BA1wzb7maa	well i think if you have good personality you're beautiful!!

Maybe he is so worried about premature ejaculation that he can't stop thinking about it and so his mind makes him do it. It could also be that he just needs to strengthen his pelvic floor muscles and learn how to squeez at the right moment during sex. If he learns these he'll have multiple O's and also then learn to stimulate you properly before releasing. Just talk to him about it without putting him under pressure. If he loves you he'll understand. I've learned recently that the key to a great sex life is communication.|`|cyFqjkolaa	may seem basic but an easy cure that I am sure he will not argue with.  Try getting him off first either oral or by hand as a game for him.  Then go into some long foreplay for you while he re-energizes.  Then the initial will be over and he should have more staying power.  Also with this may not really have to broach a difficult talk.  If this does not work then just a sit down will have to be braoched.|`|iZVJkusDaa	I don't think he would be that offended by talking about it. So just ask him how he thinks about it.

If you grow it for a while and get your skin used to having facial hair, it will adapt with time. I mean like shaving once a week or once a fortnight.

AiIZRsCnaa	Our bodies do some pretty amazing things, and it's all inter-related. So the story starts with worn-out red blood cells. The spleen filters these out and breaks them down and turns them into bile salts and other things. So we have bile salts floating around in our bodies. The liver filters these bile salts out of our system, collects them and sends them to the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small organ that lives under the liver. It is a hollow organ designed to hold liquid. A bladder. Bile used to be called gall. And that's why it's called a gall bladder. See this description by Dr. Gary Farr for a detailed examination of the gallbladder and its functions. Good diagrams too.<br>  <br>  The liver sends the bile salts to the gallbladder where they are stored. The liver also sends waste products down too. More on that later. The gallbladder collects the liquid, extracts water, and concentrates it. The end result is bile, a green, strongly alkaline, bitter, corrosive liquid.<br>  <br>  When fat globules arrive in the upper reaches of the small intestine, the duodenum, it triggers a hormone. The hormone tells the gallbladder that bile is needed, so the gallbladder does a muscular contraction and dumps a large quantity of bile into the duodenum to deal with the fat. The enzymes that digest fat can only work on the surface of the fat globules. To effectively digest the fat, the surface area needs to be as large as possible so the enzymes can get at the fat. The bile acts as a detergent on the fat and causes the large fat globules to break down into microscopic droplets thereby creating a much greater surface for the enzymes to work on to digest the fat.<br>  <br>  |`|cf3b4c9a1788b436ca969afa64100affaa	It helps break down fat, but is not neccessary.

6uTFFKX2aa	Toning Up...<br>  I'm doing a bit of research on that myself.  I've got out a bunch of books on Military training from my local Library and a video on "Navy S.E.A.L." style PT workouts.  I'm a BIG advocate of the ole' 50 pushup/50 situp method, but that's not at all a complete workout.  A complete workout (head to toe) that concentrates on many or all areas will keep your body toned evenly. and when I say workout, it's all about what you can do outside of a gym.  No weights or gear are necessary to build a good physique.  However, a ten-pound "medicine ball", used alone or with a couple friends, will MOST DEFINITELY tone your stomach, ribs, lovehandles, glutes, etc.  You can substitute the M.Ball with a gallon of water (8.34 Lbs.)  The best part is that M.Ball exercises work the "useful" muscles, muscles that  you use all the time.<br>  A good 2-5 mile run is not "too much" to ask for a decent workout.  If you're not keen on the run, a considerable 2-5 mile hike with lots of elevation change and a full day-pack, even if done only a couple times a week, will keep you fit.  AND REMEMBER TO STRETCH.  Stretching will keep your muscles from to much size.  Size is overrated and you may be prone to straining those muscles if you're actually DOING a big activity or a long trek.<br>  Another place to look for hints on a severe workout that will keep you begging for more is in Tom Brown, Jr.'s Scout Training.  Tell me how long you can hold a chunk of fire wood fully extended between your hands... end to end?<br>  Be sure to drink about 3 liters of water per day of exertion. The more water you drink, the more impurities pass through and out of your body.  Your fat stores those impurities for later otherwise.  The water also helps your body to utilize your fat stores for energy during exertion.<br>  I'm a vegetarian for all but 3-5 days a month.  I'm a BIG advocate of the Vegetarian protein research.  Seaweeds are FULL of proteins and some have the complete protein combinations that your body needs for proper function.  Nuts/seeds are also full of proteins.  Pine nuts carry high levels of protein.  Pine nuts from the Pinon Pine carry complete protein.  Also, a hand full of [leeched] acorns has more protein than a pound of hamburger.   All of this to say that you must have fats, fiber and carbohydrates to maintain proper body function.  The Carbs are converted to sugars (the good kind) and then act as energy.  Many times have I finished a day full of hiking/working and returned to a plate full of pasta or a jar of peanut butter and a spoon (regardless of the peanut issues some people are concerned about) simply for the amount of energy that returns after I have some.<br>  !!!Remember!!!<br>  I'm no expert, so don't use this answer as Physical Education gospel.  Do your own research, just like I am!  {I love the library}|`|QZTsiXAZaa	When we lose weight, there is no way to specifically burn fat from one part of the body.

pNcBL5lAaa	l'unico rimedio che con me funziona...pompelmi spremuti in bocca..ti creano acidià e la fame si placa in un'attimo..sgranocchiare qls invece secondo me è sbagliato..ho provato anche con finocchi ma poi la fame ti torna..se cominci a mettere qls sotto i denti poi hai voglia di aver sempre la bocca piena<br>  La fame nervosa è una delle cause principali dei chili di troppo. L’eating emozionale, così come la chiamano gli esperti, porta a mescolare le emozioni con l’assunzione di cibo, usandolo per affrontare le situazioni e le emozioni che viviamo ogni giorno. Seguire uno schema alimentare equilibrato e sano non fa ingrassare, e per perdere peso spesso basta evitare di mangiare fuori orario spuntini ipercalorici. Ma ecco di seguito alcuni consigli utili per resistere alle tentazioni della fame o almeno per provare a cedere senza nuocere eccessivamente al peso e alla salute.<br>  1. RIEQUIIBRARE LO SCHEMA ALIMENTARE<br>  Spesso la fame eccessiva nasce da un’alimentazione non corretta, perché troppo ricca di zuccheri raffinati, grassi saturi ecc., oppure a errate associazioni alimentari, scarsa assunzione di acqua e di fibre e distribuzione non equilibrata dei pasti nel corso della giornata. Un’alimentazione di questo tipo può provocare continui picchi alti di zuccheri nel sangue e di neurotrasmettitori “del buonumore”, quali endorfine e serotonina, a cui seguono altrettante cadute di questi valori , che producono una fame “falsa” spingendo nuovamente alla ricerca di cibo, finendo col creare un vero e proprio circolo vizioso.a per iniziare due regole fondamentali:<br>  o Consumare cibi ad alto contenuto di fibre (cereali, legumi, verdure e frutta), questi aiutano a normalizzare la peristalsi intestinale e aumentano il senso di sazietà, migliorano la flora batterica intestinale e riducono l’assorbimento dei grassi;<br>  o Non saltare mai gli spuntini a metà mattina e metà pomeriggio…un frutto, una macedonia, uno yogurt magro aiuteranno ad arrivare a tavola con meno appetito!!!<br>  2. E SE ARRIVA LA VOGLIA DI QUALCHE GOLOSITA’…<br>  Con la fame nervosa, spesso non basta riequilibrare lo schema alimentare, perché arriveranno comunque i desideri alimentari ed il bisogno di cedere alle tentazioni. Bene ciò che importa è prendere coscienza di questo vissuto e per farlo nel modo migliore consiglio di prendere un quaderno dove annotare ciò che si prova nel momento in cui si desidera un determinato cibo , qual è la motivazione che ci ha portato a mangiare, quali sono i pensieri, le emozioni che si hanno in quel momento o che cosa è accaduto per sentirsi così. Nel frattempo ecco alcuni sostituti poco calorici per calmare la voglia di…<br>  o Biscotti: possono essere sostituite con tre meringhette a 80 Kcal (20g) contro le 150 di 3 biscotti;<br>  o Cioccolato: sostituirlo con un bel bicchiere di latte magro con un cucchiaio di cacao dolce (70kcal) contro una tavoletta di cioccolato che apporta oltre 500 kcal;<br>  o Pizza: due gallette condite con origano e salsa di pomodoro fanno risparmiare circa 250 kcal rispetto a una fetta di pizza;<br>  o Gelato: preferire lo yogurt greco 0% grassi con miele e cacao o frutta per circa 60 kcal per una ciotola contro le oltre 200 del gelato;<br>  o Pistacchi salati, arachidi e patatine: una o due gallette di riso condite con capperi tritati e un’acciuga sott’olio…si risparmiano fino a 300 kcal.<br>  inizia a leggere le riviste"riza dimagrire" e "riza salute naturale"..a me hanno aiutata molto.|`|21iQJd9Maa	Dai peso ai tuoi gesti: ogni avanzo che tiri fuori dal frigo, ogni pezzo di pane che spolveri dalla cambusa, osservalo con lentezza e descrivilo a te in ogni angolazione.<br>  Medita il cibo e rendilo "pieno", con calma e osservazione.|`|kRMIsqGyaa	il miglior modo x farti passare la fame nervosa è bere un bicchiere d'acqua o al limite una verdura ( i finocchi sono perfetti, ma anche le carote vanno bene...hanno pochissime calorie e ti danno la sensazione di non avere lo stomaco vuoto)|`|3oHnNYf6aa	non c'è una vera e propria cura.. quello che puoi fare pero è cercare di calmarti e resistere alla tentazione.. non è poi cosi difficile!|`|0HNdlOqaaa	devi tenerti molto impegnata e non avere a portata di mano tutte quelle cose buonissime ma che ti fanno in un certo senso male....ciao ciao|`|vkj4b03waa	Evitando d star snz fare nulla ,nn comprando merendine etc etc ma soprattutto tenerti impegnata è la cosa migliore|`|2Glv7WP6aa	io conosco solo la fame chimica XD|`|OlN8fSf1aa	anke io conosco la fame chimica!!! stamattina ho avuto proprio un'attacco!!!
jaPigsB3aa	I just got out of my walking boot and am still on crutches with regular shoes now.... Wear some really nice pants that kinda flare at the bottom, perhaps get a longer pair than you usually wear. The longer pants will cover the walking boot up. Wear a really nice top that looks good with black pants and black shoes. If your walking boot is black wear black pants and a black shoe on the other foot. Then for your crutches.... you gotta use those unless you are able to walk short distancs without it. You could aways wrap a nice scarf around the handle of the crutches and up the sides. You will look great... just wear a really nice outfit and don't complain to your bf about the crutches just act as though they are apart of you. If you don't mention the crutches most likely he won't even know you have them... .hey just another thought: anyone with crutches always get compassion from others. Maybe he will have compassion on you and act really sweet and stuff. play it up. Guys like to feel like they are needed... ;)|`|jzQ1GUAbaa	hm well maybe lay on his bed naked wearing nothing but the boot...or if you can take it off when your laying down try that!<br>  answer mine...im really scared. :( the one that says emergency.|`|sLTDHtpEaa	umm just wear something nice its just the boot im sure he wont mind

GKcNtHFMaa	I have been using wu-yi tea for about a month now. So far I've lost about 8 pounds. I wasn't much of a tea drinker at first, but after doing some research on it I decided to give it a try. I have a pretty busy schedule and don't have a lot of time to work out, so this was an ideal option for me.<br>  <br>  I checked out a lot of sites and found varying information for and against the tea, but one site in particular kinda caught my attention.  Some guy basically has written about his results using the tea. I also noticed quite a few comments left from people who have been using the tea and all seem to be pretty happy with it and getting results.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I'm very happy myself. I'm going to continue giving it a try and see how it goes. I don't put a ton of weight on any kind of diet product because I still think it requires us to at least change certain eating habits, but so far my results with using the tea have been very good and encouraging.<br>  <br>  When it boils down to it the best thing I like about it is it's a natural product that helps to burn fat and not some crazy kind of concoction you're putting into your body. Plus its been very easy and convenient to drink and stick with.<br>  <br>  You can check out the site yourself to see if it interests you at <a href="http://wuyitearesults.com" rel="nofollow">http://wuyitearesults.com</a>|`|GrtKfUneaa	not yet but try a colon clense it really work it cleans out your colon and makes your health better you will be more intergetic.......|`|MbYtEpJ2aa	The free E-book on this site might be just what you need to help you lose weight.

GXfe98qcaa	Bueno yo siempre cuento lo que me funciono (PODRIA SERLE DE UTILIDAD A TI Y A OTROS)<br>  MI PLAN EN SINTESIS:<br>  Aclaro que en ocasiones el medico me reemplazaba la sibutramina en periodos de alternancia con MAZINDOL.<br>  La sibutramina fue desarrollada originalmente para el tratamiento de la depresión, aunque su efecto sobre el sistema nervioso central hizo que creciera el interés por su aplicación en la obesidad. Se trata de un medicamento que suprime el apetito aumentando la disponibilidad de un neurotransmisor llamado noradrenalina.<br>  Esta clase de fármaco, que en el país se introdujo en el mercado con el nombre de Aderan, debe ser recetado por un médico.<br>  Pero no solo saca el apetito desmedido por los hidratos , sino que ademas quema grasas por termogenesis esto da un equilibrio entre saludable manejo de cualquier, dieta ,tornandola raoida y sin esfuerzo aunque algunos adicionan triacana de accion prolongada para complementar la quema de grasas y disolucion(lipolisis) y tisanas de potenciadas hierbas diureticas y laxantes(de origen natural para reducir los efectos colaterales de la hipertencion y eliminar tambien el exeso de lipidos, liquidos y la constipacion.<br>  A mi me funciono de maravillas aunque muchos dicen que la experiencia es intransferible, los amigos que fueron con esta misma doctora siguieron controles y metodos similares y obtubieron resultados favorables<br>  pd: un gran interrogante?existen buenos y malos remedios o gente mal medicada?<br>  segundo interrogante ?que tiene mas efectos colaterales los farmacos citados o el sobrepeso?<br>  Veamos: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpSL_RVTZ..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpSL_RVTZ...</a><br>  ?es bueno ser prejuicioso y decir "medicacion noooooooooo", o es siempre lo mas sano es lo mas operativo en materia de regimenes alimentarios.<br>  pd: he dejado ya la medicacion y no existio el tan temido por muchos efecto rebote(creo que el unico rebote es el que hace uno si viendose bien comienza a comer y entonces se vuelve como pelota rebotina.sin ofender, las dietas ?yo yo? o los pacientes ?yo yo?<br>  Tambien hay que ser menos hipocritas y que nos traten a los gorditos como a cualquier otro enfermo,los deabeticos saben que la insulina tiene efectos colaterales, pero igual se utilixza como complemento a la dieta, y creo que la obesidad no escapa a estos ejemplos.<br>  Suerte<br>  sugerencias:<br>  Y a ponerse en forma con salud y ayuda de un medico sin prejuicios.<br>  REITERO:<br>  Aclaro que en ocasiones el medico me reemplazaba la sibutramina en periodos de alternancia con MAZINDOL Y TRIACANA AP 2MG (acido triodotiroacetico) y la dieta que hice es esta:PRIMEROS 10 DIAS <br>  Comenze con esta dieta y luego fui alternando<br>  Con otras que encontre en : <a href="http://www.midieta.com.mx/dietas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.midieta.com.mx/dietas.htm</a><br>  Los ejercicios que hago son mas o menos siguiendo estos consejos:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARk_wxtXp..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARk_wxtXp...</a><br>  Primero hice esta dieta facil y rapida pero de corto tiempo pero luego:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Sx0jiDk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Sx0jiDk...</a><br>  Desayuno y Merienda: café- té- o infusión con edulcorante con crema, sin azúcar.<br>  <br>  3 galletas de gluten c/queso portsalut. <br>  <br>  Entre comidas: 300c.c. de yogur diet <br>  <br>  Almuerzo y cena: Carnes a voluntad<br>  <br>  Huevos, 1 por día.<br>  <br>  Brócoli, espinacas, acelga, lechuga, achicoria, (verduras de hoja)<br>  <br>  Tomate ? por día<br>  <br>  Gelatina dietética <br>  <br>  Aderezos: Mayonesa, Salsa golf, mostaza, vinagre, aceite limón pimienta.<br>  <br>  Bebidas: 2 litros Agua, mate, café, té, amargo o c/ edulcorante..

lGCCGCcxaa	Don't freak out. Just wait and explain the whole situation to your doctor. It'll be okay. You might just need to wait on breast feeding or something like that. But don't take advice from anyone except a doctor on what to do. :)|`|AA11639109	HM... this is a very difficult situation. I think that yes if you do give the baby breast milk once he/she is born if you are infected with HIV you are placing the baby at risk.|`|QP3bQxC9aa	this is exactly why you should marry if you want a kid. Irresponsible partners dont see themselves commited and they use that as an excuse to "play the field". However im not baggin on you, but why would u have sex while your pregnant. Also the only way to know for sure is if you ask your doctor. If it turns up positive i would see if the baby contracted it, if not, dont breast feed it, have someone else, if thats not an option, put he/she up for adoption. HIV Aids can prove extreeemly deady to a child. Hope everything works out for the best.|`|lsQlohzMaa	Great another good American girl having sex with her BOYFRIEND!!!!  When in hell are all of you stupid girls going to wake up and quit being used by men!!!!<br>  <br>  Whether you like it or not the truth is that if a man really loves you he will marry you as he wants no one else to have you!!!<br>  <br>  So all of you single moms out there quit trying to get sympathy by saying "I'm a single Mom"!

WgwsTcjoaa	Hi there is no need to worry. Panic attacks are very common and i have suffered with them for about 25 years. There is usually an underlying cause as well as one or more triggers. My underlying cause used to be a totally irrational fear of vomiting; it has now changed to an equally irrational fear of fainting in public! My panic attacks always centred around a fear of losing control in public.<br>  <br>  There are many ways to treat panic attacks. One of the best is controlled breathing techniques. Rebreathing into a paper bag or closing one nostril with your finger and breathing in and holding your breathe while counting to 10 is another. It is important to tell your son that his body cannot sustain a full panic attack for more than a minute or so at most, so although panic attacks are not pleasant they do quickly subside. There are also a lot of helpful books available.<br>  <br>  I have found that the only way to permanently control my panic attacks is by taking a prescribed drug called Paroxetine. I would try controlled breathing techniques and lots of reassurance and if that fails to control them then a trip to the doctor and possibly Paroxetine as a last resort.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11842734	the doctors are the best result that'ss what i did, I wasdiagnosedd withAnxietyy and depression at 15 yrs old. The doctor gave me some breathing exercises to try whilst having an attack and they really help.Im now in control of my panic attacks. I hope your son is ok, And his panic attacks start to stop soon. If you want or need anymore information don't hesitatee to ask. |`|3w18TFdAaa	hello mogi1<br>  <br>  I found this really great FREE ebook about anxiety and panic attacks titled: "Code Red: Kill Panic!

There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction... There are several other techniques to help cope them!<br>  Ok, to use Distraction: Firstly, try to....<br>  <br>  Extracted from Source.|`|f3qGumkuaa	I know how your son must be suffering.

LyR3AIvpaa	did they give you milk of magnesia immediately after the barium swallow?  that stuff sets up like concrete quickly!  Call the doctor's after hours service and have your doctor call you back.  This is very important you can have your bowel necrose (die).  If he doesn't call you back within the hour to find out what to do I would definately go to the ER see if they can administer a cathartic to get you going.
3jQwML3Qaa	Other treatment options are available, but you need to discuss them with your  doctor. Albuterol taken orally or delivered by metered dose inhaler or by nebulization is commonly used to treat mild allergic asthma. A short-acting bronchodilator, albuterol relaxes muscles that tighten around the airways during an asthma attack. <br>  <br>  But the drug does have potential side effects. The most common albuterol side effects include restlessness, irritability and nervousness. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses of albuterol. Also, the liquid (oral) form of albuterol is more likely to cause side effects than is the inhaled form. Albuterol delivered by metered dose inhaler is least likely to cause side effects. <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about your  symptoms. You may experience irritability or difficulty concentrating for a variety of reasons. Your doctor can evaluate whether the problem is related to the albuterol — or perhaps some other cause. <br>  <br>  If albuterol is the likely culprit, your doctor may recommend reducing the dose or switching to a metered dose inhaler to see if this decreases the side effects while still controlling your asthma. It may also be reasonable to switch to a different short-acting bronchodilator, such as levalbuterol (Xopenex). Like albuterol, inhaled levalbuterol opens up airways, but it may cause fewer side effects in some people. <br>  <br>  Your doctor may recommend adding a daily asthma medication to better control asthma and reduce the need for albuterol. Options may include: <br>  <br>  ■Inhaled corticosteroids. These drugs reduce airway inflammation. However, long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may affect growth. <br>  ■Oral leukotriene modifiers, such as montelukast (Singulair). Although not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers reduce airway inflammation.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	Yes, Beta agonists such as albuterol can cause a sympathetic respnose making you feel jittery (they sometimes call it the shakes), as if you were just running for a few minutes.  The prednisone can also make you feel ramped up.  The symptoms can be relieved by spacing the dose by better control of your asthma/bronchitis.|`|PvSFuN5daa	it will dissapate as the medicine wears off. Also your body will get used to it and you wont notice it as much after you have been using it for a while.  Also if it is really bothering you you may want to contact your doctor and see if you can reduce the dose so that you don't notice it as much. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if the symptoms will decrease after you are finished with the prednisone or not. I used to take both for a couple of months when I was younger, but I don't remember if it increased the symptoms or not because I was so young (like 8). <br>  <br>  hope you feel better.|`|AA10295021	Yea if u take 2 much or if ur body can't handle the dosage that you were prescribed.|`|AA11602135	Yes, it I tried an inhaler of albuterol just once that was prescribed to me and stopped using it because it made me feel like that..

icSFe3byaa	You have no choice but to move out.<br>  <br>  When I quit smoking many years ago I had to avoid my usual friends for a few months because the temptation right in your face is too much. <br>  <br>  They also became annoying because you can do some stupid stuff when you are stoned and it seems funny but when you are sober what they are doing isn't fun any more.<br>  <br>  After a few months without smoking I was able to reassociate myself with these friends since I was over it and could resist the temptation.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Move then.It's like junk food,it's not addictive but if it's there it's too tempting. <br>    Watch Woody Harrelson's documentary "The History of Marijuana" and you'lll see that the information you have on pot is government propaganda my friend.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Well obviously if you want to quit you are going to have to move out and cut ties with this friend.  That is the main reason when people go to treatment facilities they go to one far away from their hometown and are encouraged to start a new life in a new town after they finish the program so they wont fall back into their old ways.<br>  <br>  People always say that marijuana is not addictive.

Can you move back in with your parents till you find a new place?|`|297f2uSgaa	well the best way to get yourself out of it, is to book yourself into rehab<br>  <br>  but if you don't want to do that, make sure there is absolutely no way you can have access to it. tell yur friend that you don't care that he does it, but you want to get clean.<br>  <br>  Best of luck =]=]|`|Na7aCxUgaa	Hi <br>  marijuana is not addictive If you want to stop you need to move to <br>  a different place  and get a different friend.

And get a job and a girlfriend.|`|kV2tilJzaa	Sounds to me like if you really want to stop, you really need to move to another place. And honestly, it doesn't sound like you really want to stop. If your roomate is dealing you could be at risk with the law as well - If you really want to stop and still want to live there you do need to remove yourself from the situation whenever there is any smoking going on, or dealing going on. Find new friends, start going to the gym - but mostly I say you need to move to another place.|`|voBwJVK0aa	Willpower, that's it.

Then tell yourself not to do it dude, if u seriously want to quit, then actually try to. Walking isn't going to do anything for you.

YTn2ETtQaa	If you know for a fact you don't have an STD, I am 150% sure you have an infection called bacterial vaginitis/vaginosis. The very strong fishy smell is the telltale symptom, along with some discharge, and it might or might not be itchy. There is now some kind of test in the grocery stores and pharmacies that allows you to test yourself and see if you have a yeast infection or vaginitis, so you could try that, and it will let you know for sure, but I had the exact same symptoms before, and it was vaginitis. <br>  <br>  If you can get to Planned Parenthood or a health department, the actual prescription for vaginitis is pretty cheap, I think like $10-15 (without insurance). It's 7 days of a drug called Flagyl. BUT you should know that Flagyl is a seriously heavy duty antibiotic, so it can actually cause you to have a yeast infection. Pay close attention to your body after you take the Flagyl, OR you can ask when you go to the doctor if they can prescribe you some Diflucan then to take after the antibiotics just to be on the safe side. That way you won't have to go back to the doctor and pay for another visit.<br>  <br>  You really do need to go to a doctor for this one. There's not a way to get rid of it on your own; I know because I tried every home remedy out there. If it's been around for this long, you really need to medication to clear it up. Try finding a health department or clinic that provides cheaper services for low income or uninsured people. Good luck!|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Because you mention the "fishy odor "that is a tell tail sign of a bacterial infection . You will have to go see a doctor because there is no other way to get it cleared up.

SOMETIMES it can smell down there due to using certain body wash.  But thats usually just a light smell, not really fishy. You could just have a small infection, What does the fluid look like that is coming out, it is very normal to have discharge through out the month. Good luck hun, try planned parent hood.|`|5fuFXlyIaa	Probably BV, try taking probiotic acidophilus if you don't wanna get the antibiotic. Some women say it works and it only costs about $3 at Walmart in the vitamin aisle.|`|oncDS4FKaa	Increase your water intake...it will flush your system and hopefully decrease the odor...this usually works.|`|t8ngtWhVaa	You may have a yeast infection or a bacterial infection. If there is any discharge it may be yeast, if so you can by an over the counter fix at your local pharmacy, like Monostat. If there is no discharge it may be a bacterial infection. Over the counter stuff don’t work for these. One thing you can try, it sounds gross but it works for some people, is take plain yogurt, no flavoring, and insert a teaspoon full high into you cervix every night for 7-10 days, use a popsicle stick, a clean one every night. You will have to use a pad, it can be messy, do it right before you go to bed, then shower in the morning. No sex for the time you are doing this. The good bacteria in the yogurt fights the bad, smelly bacteria in your cervix, it really works for some people. If neither of these work you will have to go to the doctor, it may be an STI, you will probably need a prescription. Good luck

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

Maybe you have been doing all the tummy exercises but your flat tummy is nowhere to be found? Here are a couple of tips to get you on the right track.<br>  <br>  Most people when come to getting that flat tummy back, they first thought of doing all the exercises that are tummy or abs related, such as abs crunches, sit-ups, leg press... but little did they know that is the fat around the tummy that they need to get rid of before they would see a flatter tummy. While doing tummy exercises will help tone up the tummy muscles, it doesn't help much in losing the tummy fat. So you need to incorporate both fat loss exercises and toning exercises and a healthy eating habit in order to regain the flat tummy you once had.<br>  <br>  You don't have to go to a gym to do these exercises. If you are supper busy and only have about 30 minutes a day, that's all you need, 5-6 days a week, right out of your own home.<br>  <br>  For fat loss or fat burning exercise, do 30 minutes of cardio or often known as aerobic exercise, 3 days a week, preferably first thing in the morning. Since you have not had any thing to eat all night, your body will have to reach for stored body fat for energy when you exercise. Use the 5-20-5-workout pattern. First 5 minutes to warm up, then 20 minutes intense workout, end with 5 minutes cool down exercise. You can use exercise video, treadmill, or if you like to go out door, biking, jogging, walking, just so you will start to sweat. Find some thing you like and go for it. You can use a combination of various exercises on different days or even within each workout. It's up to you, but you must pick one and stick with it if you want to flat out that tummy.<br>  <br>  For the other 3 days, do some abs crunches and sit-ups, along with the whole body tone up program - weight training. Doing whole body weight training will build strong muscles. Building strong muscles will burn more fat, because muscle mass is metabolically more active than fat, and that means muscle will use more calories all day long. Roll out of bed, grab your elastic bands or dumbbells and in 30 minutes, you'll build strength, muscle tone, help make those bones stronger, and in no time, you should see your flat tummy appearing again.<br>  <br>  Well, most people don't have much time in the morning. Do you have to do all 30 minutes of exercise at one time? No. You can do 10 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes at noon, and 10 minutes in the evening, all 30 minutes in the evening, it doesn't matter. Although it is better if you do 30 continuous minutes, you do benefit from cardio exercise performed through out the day. However, 10 minutes is the least amount necessary to get benefits to the heart and blood vessels.<br>  <br>  A brief tips on eating healthy: make sure to avoid fried food and refined food at all cost. Eat well-balanced meals and snacks during the day. Drink plenty of clean, fresh water, basically half your body weight in ounce. If you can manage, no foods 3 hours before bedtime, and your bedtime should be around 10:00 -11:00 at night, not 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. Your body needs to rest, rejuvenate and rebuild it self, and it is doing so between the hour of 10 pm and 2 am. So getting enough sleep at the right time is important in the effort to re sculpting your body.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://online--weight--loss.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://online--weight--loss.blogspot.com</a>|`|1lW9N0TPaa	Actually it is very easy to have a basic muscle body I got em in 1 week.Lie down and lift ur legs a littttttllllle...Ur abs will grow.Then lift hevy things to increase shoulders muscles(above ur head)shoulder muscles are very important.Take continous pullups and pushups.try hanging on with on with pain.Dont just go down and up.FOr pullups go up and stay.For pushups go down and stay untill ur muscles pain.The pain of muscles is actually the start of victory.Eat calcium tablets,iron syrup and bivitamin capsules to increase streght ,endurance stamina and fertility of skin.Eat more fruits,excercise the most when ur belly is full.Use abs belt whilw u sleep they are not that effective but htey are good.Try all these I say the truth.I got a good body with these Be casual man ***** cool chill aahhaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|tIldpr7vaa	sit ups dont burn stomach fat, this is a myth u cannot target ur fat loss.<br>  <br>  U need a good diet and lots of intense cardio to lose the fat|`|kk8TeZW8aa	yoga!<br>  that is the key word.<br>  it does wonders.<br>  its magical.

CBgDc1Auaa	it's pretty simple really... You're body is adjusting to a different lifestyle, and the fact that you only eat once a day... Wrong answer...<br>  <br>  you should eat 4 or 5 times a day, in smaller amounts... this gives you energy throughout the day!  if you get hungry or feel tired, eat an apple or banana... both good sources of energy. <br>  <br>  McDonalds is not the answer!|`|FhrCLLzFaa	You lost energy because you eat a lot of crap.<br>  You need to eat healthier things<br>  and stop eating fast food all together.<br>  That's terrible for your body<br>  never go back to your old eating habits|`|0xO8Y98uaa	I think you answered your own question.  You still eat crap (other crap, but still crap) and you've stopped working out.  I've no place to lecture anyone about their diet, but definitely go with the lesser of two evils, which is whatever gives you more energy.  In your young age, you can get away with that, and regardless of what you eat, an active lifestyle is still better than an inactive one.|`|dPk9cCFhaa	I've been struggling with my weight since i was 15 so hopefully my advice will help you fast food ie McDonalds it's yummy and everything sure but if i were you i'd try this cutting back on fast foods just a little bit longer... try eating foods that are low calorie HIGH in protein 1st before you give up all hope it will give you energy i'm almost positive like tuna fish high in protein low cal also salads can be nice veggies and fruits also have carbs so they should give you energy you could also try drinking a weight loss shake sounds odd but they are full of vitamins and protein  oh and excersise a bike or walking it's not so high in pact unless you make it so hope this helps
ItJzrvQ4aa	There are numbers of reasons why a person is not tall, and most of them do not<br>  have any effective treatment.<br>  Probably the commonest cause is genetic, that is to say that one or<br>  both your parents are below average height, or that short stature runs<br>  in your family. There is really nothing that can be done about this. <br>  The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth<br>  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base<br>  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early<br>  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with<br>  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time<br>  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect<br>  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is<br>  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your<br>  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment<br>  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should<br>  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature. <br>  But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical<br>  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not<br>  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall<br>  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the<br>  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone<br>  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!<br>  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height<br>  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth<br>  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.<br>  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the<br>  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or<br>  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,<br>  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never<br>  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and<br>  be happy as you are.|`|tIldpr7vaa	ur height is totally dependent on ur genetics, nothing u can do to help it along, sorry|`|4rFCesSsaa	You should eat food rich in calcium, vitamin D and vitamin A.  Also, try doing stretching exercises. Fast cycling and swimming tone up the muscles that can help raise your height.<br>  <br>  Genetics is also a huge factor.  If your parents are short, you will most likely always be short.  If they are taller, you will probably have a growth spurt sometime.  Men usually have it in their late teens.|`|1ae9d16258ab45e516abfe6e2f73dcc8aa	the only physical way you can achieve a greater height is by 2 ways, you can take a certain type of steroid, it's a drug but it has side effects and long term health risks.<br>  <br>  The other way is to go into space, or be in a enviroment which has less gravity, like if you lived on mars, or on the moon. Your would grow taller|`|T8fldPKmaa	Buy an inverter table at a sporting goods store and stretch your back for a few minutes at a time. Take breaks, thats what michael jordan did.

I'm assuming from your name you are in the Toronto area.Or perhaps your girlfriend is. A simple internet search for the area of Toronto you are in, or just for "Members Parliament Ontario" will bring up the MP's name.<br>  <br>  If you have trouble finding the name, call any Toronto Public Library branch (in the phone book) <br>  I'm also assuming your girlfriend is aware of your HIV status. Not disclosing it may expose you to legal action.
BRDqfAy3aa	NO,it is not possible - read below - puberty and breast development- when expect first period|`|17v06tO7aa	Well there is a way to induce a period, but I believe you have to have already started it. The doctors do it anyway. In that case she just needs to wait. It is not that exciting and once she starts cramping she will regret eve considering this.|`|fZgwb1rqaa	There is no way to start your first period, and believe me you don't want to make it start! Every body is different, you have at least 20% body fat for your period to start, so if she's really active and thin she will start later than her friends. Your body is developing in the pace that's healthy for you.|`|REoNMbanaa	I don't see why someone would want their period. Once she gets it, she'll realize how terrible it is to have it anyway. I would say she should eat plenty of brocolli (it sounds weird, but it works) and not play any sports.

BRDqfAy3aa	usually at the beginning it is happening (development period) - if you did not have unprotected sex, no problems - check below "Missed period"|`|ldXSIWEyaa	unless you had unprotected sex, i wouldnt worry about it. i had this same problem happen to me. when i first started my period i had it for 2 months, then it skipped the next 2 months. i was worried also, but i was not having sex. after i got it again, i never missed another month|`|PQ4BlwX3aa	Stay calm, I had a friend who had the same problem. If your first period was in november then your body just has not become used to its cycle. It will begin to start on track and you will have your monthly friend every month for a very very long time.<br>  <br>  However, if you are sexually active, I highly recommend getting a test because you are at a critical time where normal cycles is not present and you do not want to wait until it is to late.|`|Zis1rYDoaa	have you ever had sex ?<br>  if so i would advise a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  if not it's just because your periods have not settled into a pattern yet.

K7FOmyeraa	To answer your question let me give you my own personal experience with Acai berry products.<br>  <br>  First of all, I've tried every diet solution available on the planet and Acai is honestly and truly the only weight loss product I've ever used that "actually works!"<br>  <br>  Acai is a purple berry originating from Brazil, we all know the gorgeous bodies they have down there lol<br>  <br>  I've personally lost over 30lbs using the product in pill form, and the scientific studies conducted report an average loss of 15lbs in 8 weeks<br>  <br>  The specific pills I took contain Garcinia cambogia extract, chromium polyniconate and Gymnema sylvestre extract which stimulate up to 450% more weight loss than diet and exercise alone<br>  <br>  I've done my research on this product and for me it has lived up to every expectation I had.<br>  <br>  The place I bought it from online only costs $4.95 for shipping and handling, they're actually giving the Acai pills away for free lol I couldn't believe it<br>  <br>  You also have a 60 day money back guarantee which I liked, it shows me they're confident in the product, and so am I which is why I'm totally recommending you pick it up<br>  <br>  You gotta love free! lol, well I guess $4.95 for the shipping & handling, but for the amount of weight I've lost it was worth every penny<br>  <br>  You can get the free trial of the AcaiBurn pills from this site<br>  <a href="http://thebest-deals.info/acaiburn/index-ya.html" rel="nofollow">http://thebest-deals.info/acaiburn/index...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Jess|`|LLuePviraa	I'm no sap.

z3A8meCNaa	Try switching your cardio workout with strength training.  But it might be that you have lost too much weight for your body.  Everyone's body has a set weight where it's healthy, and if you go below that it'll try to retain calories to get back up to where it should be, and if it's too much, it'll try to kick up it's metabolism so it can get back up to it's weight.  That's what my dietician told me where I was being treated for an eating disorder.  i just wish you good luck and don't try too hard! =)|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I know exactly how you feel...i gained 5 pounds over night. I ate pizza the night before and drank a lot of water and seemed to have ballooned. <br>  <br>  My best advice for you and me is to shrug it off this week. You cant gain that much fat that fast, so its DEFFINATLY water retention. In one week weigh yourself again. You will more than likely have lost the water weight AND your weekly 2-3 pounds.|`|I54KyS8Laa	Congratulations on dropping all that weight. But at 174 pounds or anywhere in there, you are at a perfect weight for your height. But because you find it still an issue is an indication that you have a self image issue. I'd recommend reading Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz--most people read it at least once in their life-time.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It's probably water retention and it will be gone within a few days.

Also the lemon will make you poop, people in Brazil use this to lose weight (beber agua com lim?o) - seriously!!!<br>  <br>  It's a good sign for your body to poop a lot - it means you're effectively cleaning out your system.<br>  <br>  Also, and I know this from when I was training for my marathon, running more makes your body poop.

Try Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), as it is an anti-inflammatory and pain medicine.  Ice should help for the first 48-72 hours.  Try to elevate the injured area as much as possible.  Swelling is a big reason for the pain.  Also, a bruise is caused by some bleeding of injured tissues.  It is going to take a while for the body to re-absorb this blood, so you may be sore for a while.  If you are still experiencing severe pain in a couple weeks, see your primary care doctor for a re-check, and possible re-X-ray.|`|PdxMOlcaaa	Ice and Tylenol
2953d7ba3f65ae2e64bbd679f73d1fbdaa	Contraceptives put your body at an increased risk for yeast infections. Given the fact that Plan B is a higher dose contraceptive, would indicate an even higher risk for one.<br>  Now you mention that your vagina hurt, if the pain was not associated with the burning, itching sensation of a yeast infection, then this could be a more serious condition. Otherwise, it was simply the consequence of a yeast infection.<br>  If the latter is true, I would suggest you do go on yeast infection medication, to ensure that your candidiasis is truly under control. But of course my best advice would be to go to a gynecologist to make sure everything is fine.<br>  Good luck and  hope this helps!|`|SlkLCLoDaa	Well, when I was 19 or so I took this pill too and never had any problems. If you are having pain or any nasty discharge or anything like that I would go see your doctor just to be safe and make sure that nothing really serious is going on.

That is why doctors caution some people to avoid coffee as it can cause heart palpitations and other signs of anxiety. If you have acid reflux problems the coffee can also cause those symptoms as it irritates your stomach and oesophagus.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that you may have used milk/creamer that was spoiled and now the bacteria is making you ill.  DO NOT DRINK ANY WATER as that will make you want to vomit.  Sip on ginger ale or cola and nibble saltines if you can tolerate it.  If, at the end of the day you still have these symptoms, an ER or doctor's visit may be in order to rule out a stroke.|`|AA10873763	Could be cleaning solutions from the coffee machine.  It's happened to me.<br>  Or maybe a coincidence - you may be coming down with the flu.|`|0JlVB36jaa	It could have been caffeine in the coffee your body probably isn't used to it cause you haven't drank it for a few years.<br>  <br>  or maybe you could be allergic to something in the coffee that you didn't know about.?<br>  just try to relax, and I hope you feel better soon.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	sounds like your body is unhappy about you stuffing caffeine in it or you could be coming down with flu or maybe you drank too much the night before.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Sometimes, the acidity in coffee, can make my stomach really upset, to the point of feeling nauseous. Given the symptoms you've described, it sounds as though you have the flu.  Drinking too much water right now, can also make you feel nauseous, so sip on some Ginger Ale, (room temp) & try eating some Saltines. The baking soda in the crackers can make your stomach feel better in time. You'd be smart to go home & climb into bed. You don't want to expose fellow workers to something that could be catchy. Chicken soup is good on the tummy but only when you start feeling as though you can eat. The broth alone can be soothing. Jello water (unrefrigerated Jello after making it) can calm a tummy too. Feel better soon!!!!!
apzX48W4aa	I'm really sorry this happened to you. And he really should have stopped if he knew he was hurting you, and you really really should have used protection. But anyways, some girls bleed just a little and some bleed alot. It depends. But I think the only thing you need to be worrying about now is pregnancy... : /|`|3WcCeOqdaa	I don't think you will necessarily bleed a lot even if you are fingered or penetrated with a penis for the first time.  My "first" time being intimate with a guy, he used his fingers and there was blood on them but not a significant amount.  Not anything like having your period.  That leads me to believe that it could be non-existent too.  Perhaps if it hurt, your hymen didn't break.<br>  <br>  I don't think the existence of a hymen indicates virginity.  It is not having had sexual intercourse that makes you a virgin.  I think at an amount of time your hymen can still be there even after having sex (if it stretches or whatnot).  If it did stretch but not break that could possibly be the cause of the pain/soreness, perhaps?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately your first time was not ideal but I tend to believe that for most girls/women it is not very exciting for many reasons, one that you mention.  You were not ready and wet nor excited.  You probably needed to do much more foreplay in order to be ready and willing.  The guy you were with was extremely uncaring and thoughtless.  A lot of guys only think of themselves; one day I hope you find a guy that cares about how you feel emotionally and physically.  Some guys prefer that the woman they are with get excited and make a point of making her so!  So when you decide to have sex again, perhaps you can make that a priority.  Get to know the guy well first and even talk about your ideas and feelings about sex.<br>  <br>  Maybe the penetration made you sore.   If your hymen is still intact I'm not sure whether or not that means that seamen cannot penetrate through.  I feel like it can though as the strongest will survive and impregnate.  <br>  <br>  There are various methods of birth control - you have to research which are best for you.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend the rhythm method but hopefully that saves you from getting pregnant.  Perhaps if the guy used a condom there'd have been sufficient lubrication on it to make penetration easier for you.  <br>  <br>  In any case, in the future be sure to use condoms.  If the guy was thoughtless enough to not care about your screaming, then he certainly doesn't care if he's wrapped his dick and infected you by any means.  I would think that your attraction to him has subsided and you will look for more in a sex partner than what you thought you saw in him.<br>  <br>  I hope to hear that you get your period so in the very least you do not have to deal with an unwanted, unexpected pregnancy.  I also hope you get checked in case he passes on some nasty infection or disease.  There is nothing wrong with waiting, too, before you have sex again (with another partner).

What exactly happens no one really knows for sure, its something that you only really know when you have one. I can only describe it as a strong pleasurable sense of release.
rxjdovzyaa	I'm not being judgmental, but by choosing to have sex at such a young age you have put yourself in a position where you have to make some very adult decisions.  This includes not being afraid to face the consequences of what you have chosen to do.  You are going to have to tell your mother.  If you really think that she will get violent, contact a trusted adult friend, teacher or counsellor at school to be with you when you tell your mother.  Then you will have to let her know what you have chosen to do with the pregnancy - terminate, or put the child up for adoption.   But, I think that you will be surprised at how supportive your mother will be even though no doubt she will be disappointed and upset that you are in this situation.  Best of luck.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I've always been against abortion, but never really understood a whole lot about it.  A few weeks ago I saw some pictures, and it is awful!  You should look for yourself and you'll never even think about having an abortion ever again!  I can't believe there are people that think its ok.  Did you hear about the girl who went in to have an abortion, but the meds started early and she actually went in to labor?  She had the baby, it was alive, and the nurse took it, put it in a trashbag and threw it away.  Those people are just unfeeling!  I know it's hard, and it shouldn't have happened, but it's not your baby's fault.  Your mom might be mad at first, but I'm sure she'll help you get through this.  I'll be praying for you!

aeZZu1HOaa	Nope, no such thing.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Infections or illnesses and the medications needed to treat them can possibly cause problems. It might be that an infection of that area is prone to cause a certain bacteria thats tough to treat. Call your OB asap with any health issues. Do no new piercings etc while pregnant or if you think you may be pregnant. The first three months when part of that time new moms dont know thier pregnant is when the babies is growing most of its major body structures, so it is a dangerous time in a sense.  Being a pregnant teenage in itself has the highest birth defect rate and more autistic children are born to teens (up to 21) and older women, statistically speaking.

You are doing everything right, as long as you continue to cleanse your face and skin after exercise. Saunas also have excellent benefits for the skin, as the sweating helps to open the pores, and if you use a cleanser/wash afterwards, then your pores will be deeply cleansed. Remember to use a cleanser of wash twice a day (usually morning and night). Pat dry your face, don't rub. Also, over-washing can cause irritation, therefore meaning more spots.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|2UDbOpxTaa	It won't make your skin worse. Just make sure you stay well hydrated.

jekg18hXaa	On the serious note, Yes, runners get them more than any other sport because running dehydrates your body fluid and therefore get constipates easily. More than half the world's population will develop hemorrhoids mainly after the age of 30.  A lot of people don't even know they have hemorrhoids. The rectum is not an area you can readily see. Some times you don't know you have hemorrhoids until you see blood in the toilet water after a bowel movement, when you start to have pain or discomfort in the rectum, or when you feel extra tissue around the rectum.<br>  <br>  You need to consume more intake of fiber which is vegetables and fruits base. Sitting too much also cause hems.  I suggest you drink lot of water and buy anus suppositories over the counter that treat hemorrhoids. You put those into your anal once a day. take warm showers too and keep your area clean.<br>  <br>  For sure, constipation is not the only way you can get hemorrhoids. Here are some additional reason which you get them:<br>  <br>  * Alcoholism or drinking to many alcoholic drinks<br>  <br>  * Being pregnant and not eating enough fiber<br>  <br>  * Doing daily heavy lifting and holding your breath while you do it<br>  <br>  * Eating excessive processed foods, which are low in fiber and move slowly through your colon.<br>  <br>  * General body weakness, which will affect the colon function<br>  <br>  * Having a predisposition to constipation or inheriting a weakness in the colon and rectum area * Holding fecal matter too long in the rectum causing pressure to buildup in the rectum veins - postponing a bowel movement<br>  <br>  * Having a weak liver, which reduces the amount of bile released into the intestines. Bile helps to active peristaltic action.<br>  <br>  * Having inflammation in the rectum that causes you to have constipation<br>  <br>  * Irregular eating patterns<br>  <br>  * Lack of protein leading to weak tissues and slow healing of wounds<br>  <br>  * Not eating foods that keeps you constipation free such as fiber, vegetables, essential fatty acids, protein, water.<br>  <br>  * Not getting the right vitamins and minerals in your food.<br>  <br>  * Being overweight<br>  <br>  * Poor muscle tone in the anal area from lack of exercise<br>  <br>  * Pressure on rectum veins from cysts or tumor in the colon<br>  <br>  * Sitting in a chair at home, at work, in a car, or in a truck for long periods<br>  <br>  * Using laxatives to the point where your colon no longer works properly and you end up with constipation<br>  <br>  I hope that this information might help you to work better for your hemorrhoid. Herein is a useful information resource will help you even further.|`|63bad0287364f42fcb1f15fc1fcea2a0aa	I sometimes get them if conditions are too moist down there like from sweating.

You need energy to survive and when you don't get enough your body goes into "starvation mode", basically it stores all the food you eat as fat. So when you start eating properly again, all of the food you eat will be stored as fat and you will gain at least double what you've lost! Try to eat 1200-1400 calories a day (more if you are active or tall) and exercise regularly, and you will lose the weight healthily. Good luck.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	That's not good. You can basically eat a couple servings of fruit and tons of veggies and still lose weight. Maybe protein too. I can't tell if you had any b/c you didn't say what kind of sandwich or cereal.

I'm just over 12st and very active, so should eat a good diet (so Lisa keeps telling me) but sometimes I'm just too busy, so a sarny and then some cereal later in the day end up the meal of choice. If I have a cr@ppy day like that, I usually ensure I eat properly the following day :)|`|JdZ1GSrRaa	it's actually very unhealthy to eat like that. You're body is not getting the nutrients it needs. Actually by doing that you will GAIN weight because your metabolism will slow down. At least try to eat breakfast because that will speed up your metabollism and is the most important meal of the day. There's a diet called 9 meals a day which actually helps you lose weight because it tricks your body. Eat 3 square, big meals and then 6 mini meals(snacks)...one of my friends did this and lost 4 pounds in 2 days|`|IhTXPnyHaa	That's exactly what I wanna do but not eat that little. Don't eat little then loads of trash the next day. Your body will store it as fat if you do that, drinks lots of water to keep your metabolism up and stick it that way. Include chicken and have lots of salads and stuff. Personally i think it's too little, do this you will be happy with the results. (=|`|VaFGfmyaaa	WOW! You're starving your body and its not good. You're body will start storing fat since it will think that their is no food. The best way to lose weight is by eating 4-5 small balanced meals. Eat healthy and avoid fatty foods at night. Combine it with some exercise and you should start seeing result within 3 months. This is the healthy way, the right way! <br>  <br>  Remember to stay active too, many people have this idea of just working out is enough and fail to see that being fit is a lifestyle.

I don't care if they stay shy to the rest of the world.  I think the bigger issue is that I never know if I'm boring or angering a shy person.  It makes me worry when I try talking to someone and they don't add to the conversation.  I feel like I'm annoying them by trying to talk to them.
zMj2ikmeaa	The correct spelling is Attention Deficit Disorder. That will help you in your research. There is also a hyperactive side to ADD which is ADHD. To answer your question now, YES, adults can also have ADD/ADHD. <br>  <br>  I do. I also have those moments where my brain feels like there's a million and one things going on at once and I just cannot concentrate. I can best describe it as a bundle of loose wires flailing in all directions. <br>  <br>  ADD/ADHD affects every facet of a person's life: social, personal, and professional. To sit still and concentrate on school work? You'd have thought someone put ants in my pants. I struggled through college and managed a B average but I had to work really hard at it. My desk at home is usually a disorganized mess of papers; I rarely can focus on one house cleaning chore easily...I have multiple chores at once and consider it a gerat accomplishment if I stay on task and finish. However, at work, it's a different story...I'm hyper focused on my work and try not to rush through things. I stay on task and finish my work.<br>  <br>  A few helpful things: <br>  <br>  1) Get help. Talk to a doctor; you may need medication or at least some form of therapy to help without medication. I use .25 mg of Xanax as needed and it helps. Also the stinky herb Valerian Root (over the counter) is a milder version of tranquilzers. <br>  <br>  2) Get organized and STAY organized. Papers: sort through them immediately and determine what's trash and what's not. Can't decide now? Put them in a "Miscellaneous" folder. <br>  <br>  3) Keep a To Do list to help keep you focused on tasks. Cross off each task as it's finished. <br>  <br>  4) Turn down the volume of TV & music so you can think more clearly. <br>  <br>  5) Last and most helpful to me...when all else fails...try a quick meditation. Close your eyes, center edge of your hand between your eyes and visualize trying to make a moving vertical line stay in center. Once that line gets to center and is stable for a few seconds, open your eyes. ((( This has helped me when medication is not readily available and has also helped me focus on the game when I'm bowling in the batters box in softball. I visualize a strike or good hit...and it usually helps.)))<br>  <br>  Go to a search engin and type "Adults with ADD "  You should get volumes of information.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uaoqIAfKaa	I was diagnosed with ADHD... I was diagnosed with this at age 26 (now 29). The feeling I have/had is extremely restless. My memory was okay, but only when I was able to pay attention. For example, I'd be able to listen to professors and teachers for about 5 minutes or so, but then would just wonder off... couldn't get back to paying attention. That being said, I didn't really forgot was being said, but rather just didn't know what was said because I wasn't able to listen. <br>  <br>  My ADHD would also make me feel very claustrophobic at times, when I was stuck in a room just sitting there... I would almost feel like I'm about to have a panic attack. Since I was young, I was able to control this, but there were times that made me feel so overwhelmed I wanted to jump out of my skin. <br>  <br>  Doing normal things has always been difficult. Watching movies, writing reports, etc, has always been a tough task and a huge accomplishment. Even with this post, I find myself losing train of thought... Exercise was always good, but as long as it wasn't running a treadmill or riding a stationary bike - these activities made me want to shoot myself... Sports did the trick...<br>  <br>  Eventually, I believe that this condition led me to a pretty bad drinking problem (in the early 20s) .... Which led to a completely new set of problems. <br>  <br>  I find myself able to concentrate a bit longer than before, but it's still difficult. If you feel like this in any way, I suggest making an appointment with a psychiatrist...

This will usually cover your appointments and prescriptions.  Worse comes to worse, go to the hospital.  Non-profit hospitals usually have a policy that no one can be turned away for lack of ability to pay.  Good luck.  I have been in your shoes before.

It is a very natural physical reaction to fight or flight. Try embracing the stress, it is what gives you the energy to work hard on things that matter, like starting a business.  As far as the bf goes, make every moment count, the pressure to do so should cause both of you to avoid discussions about "what's wrong" or "we don't see each other enough". Two people working very hard is a great thing, you have that in common.<br>  <br>  Of course it could be that he's the wrong one for you or vis-a-versa. <br>  <br>  Let your stress help you excel.  Your mind and body can handle it if you tap it.   Think about a soldier at war. Are you under more stress than that?

FLBuzlCuaa	It's best to work out every OTHER day. If you want to work out everyday or twice a day, don't work on the same muscle groups in that time period. So for example.. if you work your biceps vigorously on monday.. do not work on them monday night.. if you decide to do them tuesday do it VERY lightly.. but generally if you work out hard on a monday, you would not do the same muscle grouping again until wednesday.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Working out 2x a day isn't necessarily bad but if you're working the same muscles then you aren't going to see optimal results, particularly if we're talking about weight training. Gains come during the recovery period, that period between workouts but you are working them again before they've had a chance to recover and build on the work you did. <br>  <br>  If we're talking about cardio, what I suggest is high intensity, short duration exercises in the morning, but less intense longer duration at night. Or weight training in the morning and cardio (preferrably high intensity) at night if you're going to go 2x a day. But you don't need to necessarily take a day off everytime you workout. For weight training, you can google "workout splits" to gain an idea of how you can divide the muscles you work if you weight train frequently (eg. 5 days/week). Or you can alternate the 2 a day cardio with morning weight training and evening cardio.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  If you're talking about specific weight exercises then yes you want to go until failure to see maximum results but definitely not 2x in the same day. Every other day would be better for a specific muscle group.|`|txjE1Dauaa	Working out more may or maynot help You reduce an extra fat layer to reveal the muscles. A better way to reduce fat  is to do cardio one day and weights the next .This way You dont burn out.|`|pUpUkX14aa	There is nothing wrong with working out twice a day.  You shouldn't work out the same body part twice a day unless you know how to train properly.  You could do more harm then good.  It's best to give your muscles a rest period after your workout.<br>  <br>  I would work out different body parts if I was going twice a day.  Another option is doing weight lifting as one workout then do something like interval training for the second part.  This way you are maximizing your fat burning for the day.  <br>  <br>  If you don't know what interval training is here's an ehow article that explains it.  It's much better for burning fat then cardio is.

AA10766729	If you're using a pad, then yes you're going to have blood when you urinate.

If its just when you wipe you see it on there, or see it down the toilet after you wee then yeah thats normal.|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	The first answerer is correct. If this only happens when you have your period, then what is happening is that the stream of urine is flushing blood that is built up around the vagina and it will look as if you are peeing blood, but you aren't. If it happens when you don't have your period, then this is a problem and you need to see a doctor.

ahS4TuSEaa	I suggest cleaning out your bowels and colon plus increasing the probiotic bacteria in your intestines.  This can be done a number of different ways.<br>  <br>  For you, I would suggest taking Metamucil (unsweetened) just after you scarf down all that food and a couple of acidoplhilus/bifidus capsules (health food store) 30 minutes after your meal.  Neither will adversely affect your meds.<br>  <br>  The colon cleansing is optional.  The easiest way to do this is by juice fasts (eating fruit & water for breakfast in a blender, veggies and water the rest of the day & l clove garlic mixed in/day (optional)).  You can add spices or use some V-8 to mix in if you wish.  Try it for one day or 2 if it really helps you.

This is something that shouldn't be joked about.  <br>  I hope that you find some sort of peace in your life, so you don't have to feel the need to upset others like this.|`|yZHxm8Fraa	Pros ... hmm.<br>  <br>  Cons ... well let me think.|`|08Vk3RtJaa	there are no pros.|`|pep8quOYaa	... u gotta be kidin me... =|
BCebZRu3aa	I have worked in an ER for three years now. Trust me when I say that it doesn't hurt to go in and get checked out. They will do an EKG and blood work which will go a long way towards finding out what it is. If its nothing, then great. No harm in being sure. Do it now. The first hours are crucial.|`|n2DfXIwcaa	its just gas. It happens to me and im 20 y/o.|`|VATukc46aa	I agree with 'plastic mark'.  Not all heart attacks cause people to suffer from chest pain, nausea or shortness of breath (the classic signs) so it's definitely worth checking it out at the hospital.  <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon :)
3o6qACycaa	Doctor?
XzV4bUeFaa	Good luck w/that one.  Fibro is definetly a REAL DISEASE but of course since there isn't an actual med test to say NEG or POS, we are hard pressed to get help needed.  I say we as I suffer from it.  Don't know what caused it, but have been diagnosed for at least 6 yrs.  Worked until 2 1/2 yrs. ago and then couldn't take pain, anxiety, IBS, etc.  all of which are parts of having fibro.  Again not everyone gets the same symptoms and not everyone gets same results from meds given.  I've applied for Social Security Disability last August and am still waiting to hear a verdict (first verdict).  Lawyer says that if verdict is against me we have to apply for reconsideration.  Takes another 6 mos from then.  If still no, then apply for actual hearing which can take UP TO 18 months from then.  As far as you getting a set amt. from compensation it would depend on your state and if you can prove it resulted from the actual happening at work.  Hope you have a lawyer and good luck but make sure you know you have as LONG WAIT!|`|PnlgLBcwaa	the way you ask--you sound liek a scammer--you just want to know what it is worth<br>  <br>  if you are injured on the job--you can sue for the actual cost of tretaing teh injury/lost wages--and some pain and suffering--<br>  <br>  you can not sue just to get rich quick--<br>  <br>  <br>  is is true that fms can be triggered by a traumatic injury<br>  \<br>  but don't try anything suggested by fibrofix-it is pure quackery--taht person was misdiagnosed and never had real fms---liver damage is NOT a specific route to fms--although any severe illness or physical or emotional traumancan trigger it<br>  <br>  yu sound as if you are looking to live teh life of luxery-whcih you would not do if you really had fms--no matter how much money you had|`|ji8J9k6Baa	first of all Fibro is not a disease~ it is a 'symptom'~ this is an important thing to remember. <br>  <br>  Next thing~ there is no way to 100% prove one have fibro~ the doctors can only  positively rule out all the other disease/illness that there are accurate testing for.<br>  <br>  There are also other symptoms that coincide with fibro~ you might have none, some or most of them~ I have just about all. They very from stomach disorders to chronic sinus infections.<br>  <br>  It took me almost 2 yrs to be completely tested and determined to have fibro~ in order to get perm. disability.  I realize your wanting to sue your employer.  I guess you would need proof of your fall.  I really dont think you have a case. <br>  <br>  As fibromyalgia can also be hereditary~ thats how they are finding children are being found with it at such young ages.  Your employer could counter you had this before the fall.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|9c602a89600531b7e92ac1d7eaccc1ffaa	There are 4 Routes to Fibromyalgia - Viral, Abuse/Stress, Trauma, and Physical Damage to Liver (usually a rear end car accident).<br>  <br>  It is possible for a fall to lead to FMS. It damages the liver the way that shaking a baby causes Shaken Baby Syndrome (damage to the brain).  <br>  <br>  Email me directly   annehillebrand@bellsouth.net  with your complete contact info and I will give you the name of the top attorney for trauma induced Fibromyalgia representation.|`|fMilDRgLaa	No, Fibromyalgia is not caused by falls. Sorry, it just isn't.|`|UtgCbhk0aa	you're the one who fell right?. Frivolous lawsuits are for the weak.|`|7ad9613c8d5ae845d95041fa6ba8d572aa	probably not much. you have to be able to prove that the fall caused the fibromyalgia and there is no way to medically prove that as there is no actual cause know for fibromyalgia.  True the fall probably contributed to it but actually caused it is another thing.  Have you consulted a lawyer?  Do you have an active work comp claim?  If so what has your doctor told you?  He will have to give you what's called a permanent partial disability rating based on the type of accident and what the residual or lasting effects are on you, if you would be able to return to any type of work not necessarily what you were previously doing.  It is based on that rating that your final settlement will be based on.
LMoJl7hFaa	I hope he pays attention when he wrote the Xanax. It has been my observation that medical doctors know far too little when they prescribe psychiatric drugs like Xanax.  <br>  <br>  The way to handle it is to talk to your pharmacist.  He has a database where he can check if the two would interfere with each other.|`|cWDe3D6haa	There are no known interactions with these two medications.
7ad9613c8d5ae845d95041fa6ba8d572aa	did your doctor give you a knee brace?  you can always pick up an elastic knee sleeve at your local pharmacy.  You may need some physical therapy.  It's not unusual to have some stiffness and limited range of motion if you haven't been using your knee much for a few days.  The more activity you can do the better it is.  If you're still having a lot of pain and stiffness in a couple of days then call your doctor back.  Sometimes there can be a small tear that will only show up on MRI but can cause a lot of pain.|`|NaKpEWTdaa	I'm answering based on my experience. Two months ago, I've started to experience shooting pains on my left knee. All I did was self-medicate with painkillers (which I know is wrong). I assumed right away that it's tendinitis. I did nothing more to relieve the pain. At night when I sleep, I try to sleep on the opposite side but still wakes up with excruciating pain on my affected leg. I just tried to walk as normally as I could although my ROM was limited (as you too have mentioned) and bending it was hell. I sometimes do minor stretches on my knee, pushing it until I can tolerate the pain. After a while, the pain started to subside but it just goes on and off. Thankfully, it's been two weeks now since my knee last ached. Now I feel good as new.<br>  <br>  I don't advice you to not do anything about it. I'm just relating my own experience to you. I just let it pass and I didn't let the pain limit my movement. I just walked with more care and effort. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!
fb0wDnw7aa	he has less amount of calcium in his body..he needs vitamin C....for this he should drink milk every day twice n have a healthy meal|`|Ky7ibvX6aa	He should stretch more. Before bed and in the morning. Maybe he should take yoga.
XzV4bUeFaa	Most of your son's symptoms did mimic a virus, but after a month and w/temp of 104.5 some tests should have been done.  Cellulitis is an infection of in inner skin under the dermis.  Usu. occuring on the legs.  Did he show any signs of this?  Any swelling, etc. Or is this cellulitis on his face (which is first time I heard of this).  I don't think a lawsuit will be taken unless, God forbid, your son is left incapacitated in some way, loses a limb or dies.  Better to have your child back to his normal self and never use that doctor again and to let others know not to use him.
BRDqfAy3aa	discover below  everything about yeast infection|`|522961b338681c80c19e6a82d57cecacaa	The Planned Parenthood website has a lot of information on yeast infections. I would recommend looking there.|`|SteCkEuxaa	Go to www.vaginapagina.com  It has all the answers for yeast infections and they have great remedies too!|`|wE32nIF1aa	No, there’s nothing to worry about. Your skin is normally very effective at blocking the fungus and keeping it from developing into a potentially harmful infection.? Your skin won’t allow any of the fungi to travel to locations it shouldn’t.? It’s only when you skin gets torn or cut, or when there’s some type of breakdown in your system, that this fungus normally penetrates.? And that’s when the trouble starts.<br>   An infection occurs when these Candida albicans – and about 20 other species of candida – discover these warm moist locations under our skin.? It’s in these places that the fungi thrive. They begin to multiply prolifically enough to cause an infection.<br>   Candida albicans is a versatile fungus, affecting many parts of the body when it gets the chance. Most commonly women think of the yeast infection, Candiasis, as being an infection most associated with the vagina.? You might be surprised to learn, though, that a diaper rash is also caused by one of these species of Candiasis.? So is thrush, a common infection of the mouth as well as some infections of the nail bed.<br>   Yeast infections seem to appear more frequently as a person ages.? Adults have been known to be affected with oral infections of this fungus around dentures, as well as under the breasts and lower abdomen as well as beneath other skin folds.? Most of these infections are merely superficial. They are easily treated and quickly go away with no complications.<br>   In very rare instances, though, a yeast infection may spread throughout the body.? The medical community calls this systemic candidal disease. This, indeed, can develop into a very serious health problem.? Some statistics say that up to 75 percent of individuals who develop this disease die from it.<br>   And while most yeast infections cause little problems and clear up with routine treatment, there are instances of more resistant cases of yeast infections – that don’t necessarily attack your entire body -- that stubbornly don’t yield to regular medications.<br>   More than that, though, if a person regularly seems to develop yeast infection after yeast infection, it may be a signal the she has a more serious, underlying health problem, such as diabetes, leukemia or even AIDS.<br>  I'll be posting more articles about yeast infections including causes, conventional treatment, symptoms and alternative treatments on my blog at <a href="http://BestNaturalRemediesOnline.com" rel="nofollow">http://BestNaturalRemediesOnline.com</a>
FE3h7PtUaa	idk i got those to so dont feel bad|`|AA11599407	Sounds like possible plantar warts which are just warts found on the bottom of the foot.|`|AA11913364	They could be plantar warts and you could have gotten them from your friend's shoes.  They are contagious.  Don't wear other people's shoes.  You need to see a doctor or podiatrist.  Your feet need to be treated and so do your shoes.  You may want to encourage your friend to go too.<br>  <br>  Plantar warts are contagious and can spread from person to person through wearing other's shoes, in the shower room, and so forth, anywhere your feet can come in contact with where someone else has been.  Try not to touch them, you can spread them to other parts of your body and other places on your feet.<br>  <br>  See a doctor it is the only way to treat them properly.
