86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	Sam's Diner on I-10 at Kirkwood (SE quadrant) has great, big, lush burgers and breakfasts which are reasonably priced.<br>  <br>  The Lucky Village Chinese Buffet is standard, good enough when you are into quantity. There are several around town. <br>  <br>  Dimassi Mediterrean Buffets are also great.  There are several around town.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|VXcp8hvHaa	McDonald's buffet burgers|`|3804c41362b69be635d5ce9b2c2404d3aa	Kelley's Country Cooking down by Hobby airport off I45 and Broadway.<br>  (8015 Park Place) <br>  <br>  They have good home cooked meals. Breakfast is awesome, lunch and dinner are great too! Go when you are really really hungry because they FEED you! The portions are the biggest around and the price can't be beat. It gets pretty busy during lunch on weekdays.|`|nwuL7M7saa	Theres a Chinese buffet off of Westheimer and Fountainview. It's excellent, just make sure you go around peak hours. Otherwise like any other buffet, theres no telling how long the food has been sitting there on the warmer.|`|nmRZqyeoaa	For a burger... Beck's Prime<br>  For a buffett... i've yet to find one that excites me, so can't help you much there.  I tend to do buffett more when I go to the casino's in LA or Vegas than here in town.|`|beO40ap7aa	Go to a Brazilian Steakhouse if you have the money, its very good and a high quality buffet|`|c4OEuojoaa	Pappas barbeque

36nu3FPQaa	I eat meat and there is no way in heck that I would! Eww. Soo gross. Sometimes when I eat meat, I think about it being a muscle and then I get the heevy jeevies. It is very hard for me to see raw meat and then cook it and then eat it. It's very hard. Just give me peanut butter and jelly. But then again, where were those peanuts? How many rats/mice touched the peanut butter and/or jelly before being sealed in those containers? I bet we would all stop eating if we knew where some of our food has been, or who has touched it!!!!|`|MrLdBraoaa	I would see what it tastes like...|`|OXZvfZ8iaa	I would. Humans, unless imported from somewhere like Luxembourg, would probably be unsafe to eat (Ewwww..). "Waiter, I'm gonna try the African Child's Arm with a side of Russian D***. Sounds yummy, doesn't it?|`|pjwvzsjOaa	Eww no that just seems gross. you wouldn't know if you were eating their arm or their butt... |`|8edae8167230a10692cb67806b886f9faa	Nope. If I had money to buy food and choices I would pick a different thing, never human meat.<br>  If by the other hand, I'm starving and the only thing to eat is human, then maybe, maybe not.|`|cen8SIssaa	no i dont thinks so...thats a little gross, just a little!|`|d9L0XKF5aa	I probably would, considering we would all be used to it. But I'm a vegetarian. What if you only at humans? Humatarian? Humanitarian?|`|bNh28hjTaa	 H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks NO!|`|KtLxBXDdaa	i am a vegetarian too-- full time. i don't even touch meat.|`|6e64a18af0ffa457205d3af785bbbc7eaa	No way.....I am no Hector Lector|`|ec7y3GJZaa	yes
ddBtml37aa	I like the Golden Dragon directly behind the Full Moon B-B-Q.<br>  The Jade Palace has a buffett that I tried once and it was OK- but I don't do buffett's, always eat to much.<br>  <br>  My best recommendation is Carrabba's Itallian in front of Best Buys.<br>

Sah5tjD8aa	There is one called the fox and hound,  on the near west side.  Laast time I was there, the beer was very stale, and it was not very clean.  I would not go back...
