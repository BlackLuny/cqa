vQANppluaa	dynamat|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	To find your rattle, just turn on some bass and press down on panels until the rattles get quieter. There's probably more than one spot. press on the license plate also just to be sure.<br>  Now, all rattling is is 2 hard things hitting each other, right? So all you have to do is put something soft in between the 2 hard things. Myself and others who have conquered rattling use foam tape, of a couple different thicknesses, to stick in between rattling pieces. Those who haven't conquered rattling completely try their darndest with dynamat, and swear up and down that there's no way for rattles to be eliminated. The rattles are definitely reduced with dynamat, but are still there.<br>  Here's the thing though -- dynamat and other similar products do a great job at damping, which is different than removing rattles. If you're happy with the sound quality in your car, then you may not even have to worriy about damping. You can spend $5 on some foam tape & be done with it. Either way is going to involve removing a panel.|`|8mtmGTFLaa	this should solve your problem <a href="http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=13389" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...</a>|`|U99DiQEZaa	i have the same problem and you can fix it by making sure that the door speakers are not hitting the cover

Y77vTmq4aa	misss.evelyn santos, For car insurance the quickest method to get a cheap quote is do a auto policy comparison. If you choose the same coverage levels, you can get an fast quote to compare against others. Use the same zipcode, auto make/model, mileage and driving history to ensure you get accurate comparison. To get mulitple auto quotes, go to <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Insurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-In...</a> and you can compare all the major auto insurance companies.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The taxes are not relevant.  If you buy a car in another state, you have to pay "use tax" to the state you live in.  You cannot legally get out of sales tax by buying a car out-of-state.<br>  <br>  Same with registration.  You must register it in the state you live in, regardless of where it was bought.  <br>  <br>  And I see absolutely no sense in driving a car across the country unless you have to.  Gas is expensive, you're going to be putting a lot of miles on the car, and it's not necessarily very safe to be driving through the Arizona and New Mexico desert on your own.  I have no idea what makes you want to do this, especially when you have another option.|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	With the recent passage of the California state budget you would have to be INSANE to buy your new car here now.  The sales tax has raised to 9.75 % (the highest in the country), and auto registration fees were doubled. These measures will dramatically increase the cost of an automobile purchase in California over what you would pay in Florida. Plus once you paid all those fees to California you would have to pay them again to Florida when you re-registered the car in Florida. Add to that if you bought you car in California you would be required to purchase  insurance on the car at California rates.<br>  <br>    I understand that you really want to get your first car, but do your bank account a favor, and wait until you get to Florida. The money you save can buy you several nice pairs of shoes.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Besides the taxes and insurance cost keep in mind that any car you buy in California will have extra smog equipment which may reduce the cars performance compared to a Florida car and which might be expensive to remove.|`|Iz8wgH7Yaa	possess as much information as you could maybe is one of the options,however it is quite time consuming,here <a href="http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car...</a>  is the resource i have ever had good experience.

fkHBVn7taa	Standby works fine as long as you get on. . it can be frustrating.  <br>  <br>  Lets see here not sure about the standby list deal.  Trying to get a earlier flight is not going to be easy unless there are a lot of open seats and or if your current flight it overbooked.   <br>  <br>  I am looking at United for the 4th SFO/12:55p and there are only 9 seats left.  SFO/07:55a seats left here are 9 as well. SFO/08:44a - 9 seats as well.  SFO/10:46a 4 seats left.<br>  <br>  just because theses seats are open that does not mean they are available to your booking code. -- ie if you paid a cheap fare they are not going to put you on a flight where the seat is selling for 1200 bux. . so that's why im not sure how United standby works on that particular day.

AA11914369	At 16 he won't be allowed to enter into a financial arrangement, which is what insurance is.  So the only option will be for him to put the car in his parents name, and have them add it to their policy, with him as primary driver.  Since none of us know what company insures your friends parents cars, no one can give you an estimate except it would be high since a camaro is considered a sports car.|`|Pd4Fh0Ymaa	His parents will know what it costs, takes one phone call. Possibly 250? Btw what spotless driving record, he has NO record!  lol.<br>  Good luck anyway, hope it's cheaper than that.
AA11264416	this question has been asked a lot, AWD is when all 4 tires are 4 wheel drive all the time 24/7, 4 wheel drive is where its in 2 wheel drive for normal driving and you have to put it in 4 wheel drive yourself, im pretty sure an AWD vehicle when compared to the exact same vehicle except its 2wd or 4x4 that the gas mileage on the AWD is worse since the engine as to drive all 4 wheels|`|AA10766729	All wheel drive refers to vehicles that have permanently engaged 4-wheel drive capability.  4-wheel drive indicates that at some point, you (the operator) will need to manually engage the drive capacity.  All wheel drive does it auto-magically without any interaction or direction from you.|`|119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	Typically a 4WD vehicle is a part time system and only to be used in low traction situations such as snow, ice, sand, mud.  <br>  <br>  An AWD vehicle for the most part is in 4WD all the time due to some components in the system that allows the front and rear axles to spin at different speeds while turning.  <br>  <br>  A conventional 4WD part time system will be damaged if its used on dry pavement for long periods of time because the system mechanically locks both front and rear axles together which does not allow for different axle speeds when turning.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	AWD is most certainly NOT four wheel drive.  AWD is mainly two wheel drive.  When the computer senses wheel slippage, it will instantly send power to the wheels that are not slipping.  Once the computer senses that there is no more slippage, it reverts back to 2 wheel drive.  This all happens very quickly without the driver noticing.  The car constantly monitors each wheel and makes corrections to each wheel while driving.<br>  4 wheel drive as mainly mechanical.  A vehicle must have a transfer case to be 4wd.  A T-case is mated to the rear of the transmission and the front and rear drivelines come out and go to the axles.  A T-case has several options, 2 hi, 2 lo, 4 hi, and 4 lo.  You usually shift the T-case with a lever, there are some that are push button.  A T-case does NOT lock your axles together.  My jeep is in 4 hi all the time.  The difference between hi and lo is the amount of torque you will get.  In high, you can drive all day at any speed.  In low, you are getting maximum torque but can only go about 20-25 MPH at the max.  It is designed for off-road use where slow is the name of the game.  In 2 or 4 hi, it is no different than driving a car.  In 4 lo, you will be pushing 3000-4000 RPM at only 20-25MPH.  Locking your axles together means either installing an electronic or air powered locker in your differential.  When activated, it will lock both axle shafts together and both wheels will turn at the same rate.  If you drive on-road with them locked, you could damage the drivetrain.  They are designed for off-road use where it is likely that one wheel will come off the ground.  With a normal differential, when one wheel loses traction, all power is sent to the wheel without traction.  You will just sit there and spin your wheel.  Not good for off-road.  <br>  The main difference between AWD and 4wd is that AWD sends power to the wheels that need it and only when they need it.  4wd send power to all four wheels, regardless of whether or not they need it.  An AWD car can drive on dirt roads, but they could never go where a 4wd vehicle can go.  Take one of those little Subarus on some of the trails that I run my jeep on and the first obstacle we hit the Subaru will need to turn around and go home while my jeep just powers over it in 4 lo.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	That was a good question, thanks.

vMthRkrsaa	You have to drain the torque converter to get it all out.  How you do this depends upon the car.   When you take down the pan, you are right about the 35 -40%.|`|TqPpsGqvaa	No you need to flush it out . If the fluid is nasty black in color you have other problems . This tranny is probably now more good or in need of a rebuild . The flush might only hurt it more . Take it to a tranny shop and have them evaluate it first before you spend the money on a flush . Good luck.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The transmission flushing machine taps into one of the cooler lines to capture the old fluid while new fluid is transferred into the transmission. This procedure is done with the engine running and shifted through the gear positions and is complete when the old fluid from the transmission is no longer discolored and has been replaced by the new fluid. <br>  I doubt that this can be done as thoroughly without the proper equipment.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Yes, you can do it yourself.  You detach the transmission cooler lines from the radiator, pour clean fluid into the return line with the engine running until it comes clean out the send line (which will be probably 12+ quarts later, part of why it's so expensive to have done).  I'd use a long funnel and adapter on the return line, it may be tricky to pour into the return line fast enough, or under enough pressure.  <br>  <br>  If that's too much trouble for you, you can change the fluid the regular way, drive 3-4 miles and change it again, drive 3-4 miles and change it again, until it's clean enough on your dipstick.  It will take just as many quarts to get clean this way as with the other method.<br>  <br>  By the way, when your transmission fluid is black, that usually means you have a clutch breaking down, and it's probably too late for fluid changes to save it.  Do change your fluid, but don't expect the transmission to be able to shift through all gears for much longer.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Take ur inspection cover off and see if there is a drain plug on ur convertor.  If no u can drill a hole (1/4") near the bottom of ur converter and drain oil.  You need a tap to thread the hole for a pipe thread and put in a plug. Don't forget the cooler.  Remove the cooler lines and let oil drain out.  Its a lot of work and a messy job but with the black oil not flushing the system is a waste of money to put in a new filter and oil so it can mix with the bad.  you didn't mention if the oil had a skunky smell, if it did the trans is ready to die.  Best take it to a tranny shop and let them power flush it.|`|NbCBk3mqaa	you could disconect the trany lines to the rad .hook up rubber lines and place then in clean containers of trany fluid .Have someone help you,start the car and hold the brake,place it in gear.Be sure not to let the containers go dry.|`|AA10276489	If you have a "nasty black color" you need to see a tranny shop you can trust.I would say you have a problem that will get worse if not fixed.|`|RuUCrBBgaa	It depends what kind of car you have? Do you have a tranny dipstic? or is it sealed transmission? If you have a dipstic, in the shop they put fresh trans oil under pressure and it will push old oil out. If there's no dipstick than you'd have to look for the fill holes up on the top, but still need pressure to push the old fluid out.<br>  Good luck|`|OA7mHoabaa	ask the mechanic how he does it

ZTMjXz1saa	It depends on the flight school.  <br>  <br>  At many small mom-and-pop type flight schools, it's sort of a free for all.  That is, if you don't have many students, you tend to just sit around the flight school and wait until prospective students show up.  It can take a while for you to build up your student base.  It also depends on your personality on whether it's hard or not.  This is the time where being a flight instructor is more like being a salesman.  If you're friendly and outgoing, you probably won't have much trouble.  If you're shy, then you will have a harder time.  As you build more students, and if you're a good instructor, you will get students just by word of mouth ("hey, you should go to this flight school and ask for Joe to be your instructor").<br>  <br>  At large flight schools (the ones that cater to future professional pilots), they might have a scheduling department and assign students to whatever instructor has openings.  This can be nice because you don't have to fight for your students.<br>  <br>  gsi_joe:  The great majority of flight instructors are newly minted commercial pilots who are doing it just to build up time.  However, this shouldn't stop anyone form learning to fly.  While there are always a few bad apples, most instructors take pride in their job and strive to do a good job (and they are qualified to do the job).|`|AA12330575	Sadly, many flight instructors are using their license as a means of building flight time so they can quit instructing and get a job with the airlines.  Student pilots should seek out an instructor who is instructing because that's what he/she wants to do as a career.  To that end, it is advisable to find someone who has at least 1000 hours of flight time as a primary flight instructor and who intends to continue instructing as their chosen job.  3500 hour primary flight instructor.|`|JeUvm9NIaa	The answer for this question depends on the school you work for. <br>  Most flight schools are similar to any other job, where they interview you, check your qualifactions and have a test flight.<br>  From my expierence with a college based flight program, once the instructor starts, they are assigned students, both the help the flight instructors have a full schedule to get paid and build hours, and also to make sure that the students have open time slots for training multiple times a week. Student assignement also depends on the ratings sought, as not all flight instructors are Multi-Engine/ Instrument/ Tailwheel/ sea-plane/ or multi-intrument rated, and can only instruct private and commerical pilots.  Its not a competive job as I have noticed, but if a student has a preference, they might assign them to that instructor, or to another insturctor if it is a conflict of intrest.<br>  Some college programs will pay for the MEI/MEII or CFII for instructors if they sign a contract of length of employment or pay contract. <br>  Rule #1- Never train your friends or loved ones as an instructor.|`|4GMUPFefaa	In the common sense, when you graduate "flight school", you are getting just a license to fly. To be an instructor, you need a license for that. Before you get to that stage, you at least need a commercial flight certification. And most places wouldn't hire you to do that unless you have a instrument certification (probably the toughest one to get and keep current). AND also most places would expect you to have a multiengine rating. So there is more than just attending flight school and learning to fly, then teaching. ONCE you get all these ratings, including the instructor license, then you have a shot at getting an instructor job. MOST instructors I know have a fulltime job and build hours as a CFI as a side job and build hours that way. The pay isn't high, but you are building hours while you instruct, which has a great value if you want to go on in the business.|`|o5KbZk1saa	As mentioned below most flight schools schedule the student with the instructor.<br>  However, if, after a few lessons you just don't like the guy/ girl then you can ask for a different instructor.<br>  i have never had any problems getting or retaining students.<br>  <br>  PS: You do NOT need to have multi, instrument and a bunch of other endorsements unless you intend to instruct in those categories.

eRX96A73aa	I owned a 2002 Ford Escape and I really liked it for the first 3 months until it started causing me problems. My master cylinder starting leaking and was a big costly repair.

Very few people drive a car until it quits so I wouldn't get too excited about how many miles one will allegedly go over another.  That has more to do with proper maintenance anyway.  Consumer Reports last year did rate the 10 best cars for long term ownership and every car on the list was a Toyota/Lexus or Honda/Acura.

If that belt ever fails, your entire engine will destroy itself and need to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Also, I've found that American cars seem to be able to take a lot more everyday abuse (Fords anyway).|`|uFQFRdczaa	It's not a question of where it's made, but how it's made.  Most "Japanese" cars are made in North America--Camry at Evansville, Indiana, Honda in Canada.  Whereas some GM cars are made in Korea.<br>  <br>  The engineers at Honda and Toyota, especially through the 90s, were trying to make cars that would last a long time.  As were the engineers at Mercedes in the 70s and 80s (1974 Mercedes 240d topped 4 million miles, on 11 engine rebuilds).  Engineers at Chevy, Ford, and Chrysler --especially in the 1970s and 80s, were happy with 100,000 miles.  The exception here is trucks--Ford and Chevy were in a fierce competition to make the toughest, longest lasting trucks.<br>  <br>  Through the 90s, Detroit automakers did a better job, but with some notable exceptions.  The Geo Metro 1.0L engine is practically disposable, few people get even 80k out of that engine.  For most American cars built in the 90s, you can expect about 130k trouble-free miles.  If you make it to 190k your luck is exceptional, if you make it past 200k miles you've probably rebuilt the engine.  I've had two chevy trucks die between 190 and 200k.  If I bought Chevy or Ford, Mazda, Nissan, Daewoo, Daihatsu, Kia, or Subaru with over 160k, I would expect to replace an engine very soon.  I would not buy a Chrysler automatic transmission with over 100k miles.<br>  <br>  Well maintained Hondas and Toyotas regularly go beyond 200k miles.|`|AA10137828	My brother in law gave me his 99 Ranger after he wore it out.

Replaced bearings and all the seals and had a new truck (sort of). That truck had 489,000 miles on it. It is still on the road running great!<br>  <br>  The fact is, GM and Toyota are partnered, Ford and Mazda are partnered, as well as Chrysler and Mitsubishi. They all also have some European "blood" in them as well. <br>  <br>  There really is no such thing anymore as a "totally American" or "Japanese" car anymore. They all share technology now. Many of the "Japanese" cars are actually built in the United States!<br>  <br>  Some vehicles are even identical to their Japanese counterparts, such as the Ford Ranger/Mazda B series lines.<br>  <br>  Now, Hyundai and Kia ae making a lot of noise in the states. <br>  <br>  I think the major difference in the domestic vs. foreign (Japanese) lines lies in the manufacturing process. The Japanese learned proficiency a bit sooner than the U.S.<br>  <br>  Most any vehicle built in the last few years will give good service if it is maintained properly.|`|5YM0AblIaa	My opinion is biased but i know a few people that have 350,000 hard miles and more on their original engines in chevy and ford pickups. ive never seen that from any import and as far as abuse when i see a nissan or toyota pickup successfully pull a 35 foot gooseneck trailer with a backhoe on it........

DydFQ0fcaa	More than $500<br>  <br>  There's a good chance that the axle wasn't the only thing damaged. Usually if a car hits something hard enough to break an axle, one or more of the steering and/or suspension components suffers some damage as well.|`|AA11922860	more then 500|`|Bs7Z0Mvhaa	Generally, it would depend on it's the front or real axel.  And whether it's a 4 wheel drive would also factor into the cost.  If it's a 2 wheel drive the front axel would be cheaper because the "chunk" which holds the gears is in the back. 4 wheel drives have "chunks" on both axels.  That is what cause the wheels to turn.  I had to have a rear axel rebuilt on a 2 wheel drive tahoe a few years back and it cost me about $500 but the mechanic that did the work is good friends with my stepdad.

It has been 4 years since I bought my car, and I still feel that buying that car was one of the best decisions I have made.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to know what you want, and stick to it.  Yes, the sales person might try and pull a fast one on you, but they'll do that to just about any body.

If they are way off it's either you didn't figure the options the car/suv has on it, so I check their web site to scan what they have and the options than go to edmunds and type in all info and get my price. <br>    If all is fine on your end and they are way off, call another dealer, but most of time they are very close.<br>    have bought many and even helped many female friends of mine buy this way and no hassles at all.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Your best bet is to at least take a male with you for support (wether it be a dad or brother or uncle or friend) but where this is not possible you should request that you can have an independent mechanical inspection done on the car, and make sure you get it done.

I had a Blitz which is pretty mich known in the Subaru community as one of the loudest and believe me, it's more than just the noise,  There is a lot of bass that comes from under the car.  So much that things in the house would rattle when I pull in and out of the garage.  And I am lucky that the city I live is has pretty laid back cops but some places are not as lucky and you can really get the attention of cops.  Best thing is to go to a Subaru meet ans hear some different set ups to find the one you like.

If you are determined to be at fault in the accident in April, then theoretically they could change your current policy to account for the accident, however most insurers would wait to the next renewal. You could always call your broker/agent and ask, however this may alert them to the fact that an at-fault accident wasn't accounted for. Then again you may have accident forgiveness, or maybe the accident wasn't your fault. Unfortunately without calling you'll never know.

There is no motorcycle in the world that is cool to everyone, so that is not a reason for a sport bike either.<br>  <br>  If you are likely to grab a handfull of front brake, yes, you should have ABS.  It won't do anything for that tree in front of you, that you are strangely drawn to, because you can't countersteer in a panic, but it will help a little.  Maybe ABS will keep you from going over the bars when you see a red light too late, maybe not.<br>  <br>  By the way, Sport bikes are not good for daily commutes, you can barely carry anything, and the crouched position makes it harder to see beside you.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, keep the shiny side up.

TyNFXWHNaa	You want to put a V6 or V8 in a Mazda3? I don't think any engines with that many cylinders would fit in it. Besides, you would have to replace the transmission, uprate the springs & suspension etc... Sounds very, very expensive. You would probably come out better selling your Mazda3 & buying a car with a v6-v8 already in it & then go from there to start modifications.  A used Mustang GT (current body) would be a good place to start.
PAceoX2oaa	If your brother and sister are the size of watermelons, then this car will be GREAT for taking them places! :) Seriously, the back seats are nothing special. Kids under 10 could probably fit just fine back there, but anybody in their teens is not going to like the lack of headroom and leg room. For example, in my 1995 Eclipse, if I have my driver's seat where I'm comfortable, the space between the back of my seat and the front of the back seat is about 2 inches. Not much leg room. <br>  <br>  Greddy is a top-name in the aftermarket industry. People call it Greedy because it usually costs more than other brands.

Have it inspected at a reputable shop that's local to you.

Also, intake will rarely boost HP as significant as 10hp, sadly companies even AEM will exaggerate their results.  An ECU reflash/tune will run you anywhere from $300 up.  And it can net you up to around 20hp, but that's extreme cases and also the more mods you have the better they'll be able to tune your car to respond better to it.  As it is with just intake, all they'll pretty much do is make it a little less fuel economical for a little more power, nothing serious and definately not worth the money.

U9iTDxspaa	First you need either good credit or loads of cash. Then you go to whichever dealership you want, go in and be care full of sharks aka bad car salesmen or women. When you find a car its all about negotiation. If you can talk them down 1/6 or 1/5 the asking price, the car world is tricky and hard. Once you have settled down on a price that's when you put the down payment and drive away. Before you sign ANYTHING you need to go over the fine print, check how much your monthly payment will be, how much interest, finance options the works. All of which can be negotiated depending on how much you make a month, credit, and down payment. <br>  <br>  Now, you can go through your bank to get better payment options and interest rates, but today banks aren't giving out any loans due to the economy. If you can, all you need to do is talk to a representative at your bank and they can explain better.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, let me know how it goes if you want too....?|`|13be41146e5fb8bbe0aeff5366540ca0aa	You should call your bank and ask them what you need to qualify for a loan. Tell them of the down payment. They can tell you what the payments would be. They can also tell you how much money you qualify for so you know how much you can spend. Then when you go car shopping, the dealerships will do the same thing with their banks. Be very careful of getting into a lease.

TdrgZwnoaa	Well since this answer has already got me best answer once before I am just going to recycle it. <br>  <br>  I drive a 2008 Thomas school bus. As the driver I have a three point seat belt and that is the only seat belt on the bus. On principle I do not agree with that arrangement. I personally believe that all occupants should be belted in. I have been wearing seat belts (without exception) since they were offered on cars.<br>  <br>  However, on the practical side, I have to comply with the 'no seat belt' policy for the following reasons.<br>  <br>  1 - If I am incapacitated in an accident who is going to unbelt 48 students; and some buses can carry even more students than that!<br>  <br>  2 - what driver can stop the bus every 5 minutes and do a complete seat belt check to see if all belts are done up and, indeed, positioned properly. Remember; some buses have a 70 student capacity.<br>  <br>  3 - If there is a fire onboard there will be insufficient time to get all the students out of their belts and off the bus.<br>  <br>  4 - school bus seats are made of deformable materials and absorb impact very well.<br>  <br>  5 - I wear a seat belt primarily to enable me to remain in control of the bus in emergency avoidance maneuvers plus the fact that I have no barriers to prevent me from being thrown through a picture window sized windshield. My students are surrounded by crash padding.<br>  <br>  Although my particular bus has seat belt mounting points built in it is highly unlikely that we will see seat belts installed for a very long time. If the taxpayers want to hire two bus monitors to ride every school bus in North America full time I would welcome it. Until then the status quo will have to suffice.<br>  <br>  One of our buses was t-boned by a transport a few years ago and put onto it's side. Except for a few bumps and bruises the kids were fine. The bus driver (the only one with a seat belt) was in hospital for 2 months.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	They are not required yet.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Compartmentalization, a concept seen frequently on commercial airplanes, involves seating passengers in rows of padded seats with cushioned backs. <br>  <br>  The belief is that during frontal or rear impact, the most common types of wrecks involving school buses, passengers would either be pushed back into their seats or thrown forward into the padded backs of the row ahead. <br>  <br>  The use of seat belts might require stiffer seats, which would negate the theory of compartmentalization. It is also feared that some students would receive internal injuries from seat belts through a process called submarining, the tendency for a body to slide downwards during impact.<br>  <br>  Seat belts on school buses may also hamper rescue or evacuation efforts, as adults or older students may have to spend precious minutes unbuckling young or disoriented passengers.<br>  <br>   Unruly students could also use the heavy buckles as makeshift weapons, creating even more of a safety hazard. There is also the argument that seat belts would only protect passengers of school buses during unusual events such as roll-overs or flips, not other possible accidents such as fires or submersion. <br>  <br>  Considering the expense of retrofitting current school buses or replacing entire fleets with approved seat belt systems, the benefits of seat belt use do not currently outweigh the liabilities.<br>  <br>  One problem many school systems face with the prospect of mandatory seat belt use on school buses is compliance. The bus driver already has a significant amount of responsibility, so schools would have to hire additional monitors to ride on all the school buses. In light of sexual misconduct concerns, both male and female monitors would have to be hired in order to avoid any allegations of impropriety. <br>  <br>  Besides the added expense of hiring qualified monitors, there would also be a question of liability if even one student removed his or her seat belt and became injured as a result.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Supposedly, school bus seats are special padded to be safe in a crash.<br>  <br>  I am not convinced that this is sufficient.<br>  <br>  In any case, even if the school buses had seatbelts, most children would not wear the seat belts, so they would not be any safer than without them.  Actually, they would be less safe, because some children put the seat belts in the aisle to make other children trip.|`|I0W8r1zZaa	I don't know about you but the school I attend uses buses that has seat belts.  By the way, the seat belts are in so many colors which is weird.|`|IxGa7mnGaa	Only the magic school bus does.|`|LC3TGSr3aa	I agree. <br>  <br>  But I always thought they made the seats bigger so you don't have the chance of falling forward.<br>  <br>  Though, without the seatbelt you fall sideways. <br>  <br>  Oh, and maybe because they don't know how many kids the bus will hold so they don't bother xP <br>  <br>  I think i has something to do with safety. Incase there was ever a fire or like the bus did crash and someone got hurt and couldn't take their seatbelt off. <br>  <br>  Idk, this is just my opinion xP|`|AA10102648	but they do have seatbelts.....most school bus drivers do not enforce the wearing of the seat belt (right, how would they do that?) and most do not have a matron to monitor student behavior or enforce the wearing of seat belts.|`|0dstYdCvaa	They can't afford it... and besides it's true the driver can't keep all the kids in a seat belt.

Steel wheels do great to hold their original design concepts-within the first 3 years,but, they begin to flex wildly beyond those first few years.Thus the dreaded squeaks of pristine hubcaps being held tightly to metal that is less than correct. What really acerbates this condition, is the fact,that to change this, requires a whole-sale exchange of the wheels ,themselves. Steel-wheels of old never were of such flaw!

Hardly anyone sticks to the 2 year limit, most just ride full power. But if you wish to stay 100% legal then fair play to you.<br>  <br>  Something like a full power RS125 can embarrass a lot of bigger bikes if ridden hard and it also teaches you a lot about how to ride fast.<br>  <br>  Next step up are 250's. 2 strokes are too high power (about 50-60bhp) and are high maintenance and expensive. There are a few 4 strokes around gpz, zzr, cbr ect but they are rare and hard to get parts for.<br>  <br>  400 sports bikes are a popular choice eg vfr, cbr, zxr. You can get a ridable example of any for under ￡1000. 60bhp full power so you'd need to restrict them to be legal.<br>  <br>  500s are the commuters, gpz, gs, cb, er5 ect. Not as boring as you might think and are very good starter bikes and are very cheap. ￡500 will get you a ridable example of any.

Put out about 100bhp and are very quick for a beginner. Again would need to be restricted.<br>  <br>  My advice is go for either a 400 sports or a 500 commuter and don't bother with the restriction. You don't legally have to prove to anyone that it's restricted (though your insurance may want to see a certificate). Even if the police stop you the onus is on them to prove it is full power and 95% of them do not even know the 33bhp rule exists.|`|0k4epIhTaa	Get a Honda CB 500, they're mega reliable and about 60bhp but don't bother restricting it.<br>  Never get a 250cc bike, they are completely pointless, not that much difference when comparing against a 125cc.|`|1PuOHjOkaa	check asda|`|y58bi15Gaa	get an old aprilia af1 they go like stink

kNJbZeCgaa	look, you are almost comparing apples and oranges, here is why, you are suggesting taking a 12 to 14 year old Z car, max value 4K, and a specialty vehicle from Ford which sold for over 40 K.  So, that being said, my answer is yes, you can build a Z28 camaro of that year to out run a cobra, but it will not be easy or cheap.  Here is how, these vehicles have the LT1 engine, which is really the pinnacle of the SBC 1.  Remember, these are basically the same engine that powered the Z cars and vettes from yesterday, and you can do some amazing things with them,  Here is what I would do:  first, find a nice Z car with an automatic-I know, auto loaders are for sissies, but they are always faster than a stick if modified properly, and they are much stronger.  Pull the engine, get a stroker crank/rods and piston set to go to 3.75 or 3.80 stroke make sure you get a matched and balanced set from a reputable dealer, Scat is my choice, but not the only one.  Then take your heads, which are of course aluminum, to have them port matched and opened up to allow for more flow-this step cannot be skipped if you want to produce the type of power you are suggesting.  Make sure they have the intake also, and only use a reputable head service, who has a FLOW BENCH!!  If someone tells you he can do your set without a bench, run away fast, as he has no idea what he is talking about, although, some of the CNC after market heads have great numbers, however, you still have to port match, just use your old set, and you will not be sorry.

Been there done it.|`|HQEn6jbnaa	its a camaro|`|DV2zbNHfaa	it would be close if u could get a super charger or turbo to give u an increase of about 100 hp|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Okay, I've read the previous posts, and the answer is roughly in the middle. You can and will beat an '04 cobra two ways: <br>  <br>  First - naturally aspirated. Do the LT1 to LT4 conversion, with the heads and intake. This nets you a significant boost in flow potential with the higher ports. Stroke the bottom end, and look for a cam that's just a touch better than the LT4 cam offering (its a great cam, but there's some cams out there that will offer a better duration). That will put you over 400 horsepower, and a with a heap of torque. <br>  <br>  Second - standard LT1 with basic mods, and a squier turbo. These turbos mount in place of your muffler, and offer a packaging advantage without the parasitic drag of a supercharger (plus they're cool as all git-out). A better set of heads and a cam to take advantage of the boost, and you're in the range of the naturally aspirated package above. <br>  <br>  Next, improve your rear suspension with boxed bits and put a set of dual-adjustable shocks all around to improve the weight transfer at launch, and you're there. Mind you, that's against a stock cobra - they can still kill you with some basic and easy mods that boost their power (and most will, now that their warranty's done!). Also, start saving up for a new rear end, because you're only a couple hard pulls away from destroying your stock diff.<br>  <br>  By the way, an LT1 is most certainly NOT a first gen sbc! The last gen 1 was the TPI's that preceded the LT1/4.
aVEI9Q7kaa	first of all, i applaud you for even thinking about this :) MT is the best<br>  <br>  i actually had this done for my honda prelude 01. <br>  <br>  It might be cheaper for u since parts are more available. but altogether i spent about 1000 on parts (with tranny and all) and about 1000 for labor.<br>  <br>  YOU might only spend 1000-1500. . . i mean if its done right, its fun. and less computer/ecu stuff to worry about in an older car<br>  <br>  <br>  bottom line, if ur planning to keep ur car and like 5spd, do it.<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|SEk8XvbQaa	As per the previous post if you really desired to run a MT then its worth spending 2000$ on investment, but if you see the cost of the 1996 Honda civic today in Market its only around 3-4K, so if you spend 2K for your transmission you have to reduce that cost to the Price of the vehicle and that would be 1-2K and if you see the resale value of the Car all MT is less valued than AT. So you will end up nothing for your expense. Make your judgment & Happy Riding.|`|buDbNa57aa	if you wanna waste money.

WLPCCj9gaa	A bad shock can cause your tire to blowout if that's what your asking. Your shock is probably frozen so chances are it was the shock that caused most of the damage.<br>  <br>  <br>  One way to determine this is if you push on the hood or rear (which ever the tire went flat on) and let go, after you let go watch how many times it bounces, it should bounce about halfway. If you find that your car doesn't bounce at all then you definitely have frozen shocks.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	A pot hole can surely make a flat tire.<br>        And a pot hole can cause a shock to blow out.<br>  <br>        But a flat tire would be a result of a pot hole and not a bad shock.<br>  <br>        Just bad pot luck you've got there...<br>  <br>        Call the road department about those pot holes.  I just called<br>        ours this morning on one up the street from where I live. Hit it<br>        last night. And I'm surprised I didn't blow the tire or the shock out<br>        on that one. Just got my jaw rattled.   OUCH.....<br>  <br>        Hope this helps..|`|Fsmji7XNaa	I would say no! If tire is flat you probably hit nail or something else! Broken shocks are caused by them being worn out!
aQKTSU8iaa	It could be your that your catalytic converters are clogged or, like you said, a vacuum line.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Do not "rap" a new engine before breaking it in. New engines are very tight. Let it idle until it smooths out.  Make sure all the vacuum lines are in place and not leaking. A number of other things could cause this. It would be good to check with an OBD II code reader. If you used all the old manifolds, new gaskets and correct torque sequence was a must in assembly.|`|WLPCCj9gaa	Restricted exhaust maybe or fuel problem?|`|Fsmji7XNaa	It could be the timing or the carb is not set right.|`|TqPpsGqvaa	If this engine is brand new , call the people you bought it from ,don't drive it,did you install it or did a shop ? You could have something hooked up wrong . It could be something simple but don't take the chance have it checked over buy a mechanic .|`|7HKTDcvYaa	The other suggestions should be looked at, but it could be an O2 sensor that is broken or not connected?
BqXSymxjaa	Do they offer Drivers Ed at your high school? You need to take a class and learn the rules of the road and how to drive. Then you can get your permit and after a short period of time driving with the permit you can go in and apply for a license.|`|Fsmji7XNaa	Don't they still have drivers ed!

Run your engine without the radiator cap on for 10-20 minutes.|`|uHwIz8U3aa	Is it possible you put the thermostat in upside down? I've seen it before its not hard to do.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Watch inside the radiator to see if there is a large flow of air coming up in the coolant. This low cost test can tell your that you might have a leaking head gasket. Leaking head gasket will create a problem of air in the system, will blow out coolant, and may contaminate your coolant.<br>  <br>  It goes without saying you have to have your thermostat  installed the right way, no air in the cooling system, and preferably the cooling system needs to be able to pass coolant through both engine and radiator.
cnUKrcmuaa	What exactly are you planning to do for this tune up? The reason I ask is that there are a drastic array of different things that can be done when doing a "tune up". For starters, figuring you will swap the plugs, I have long stuck with AC Delco spark plugs on both of my Chevy's.
daw140ceaa	Yes, that amplifier should work very well for your subs.  When you combine two 8-ohm subs in parallel, the result is a 4-ohm load at the amp.  The 300 watts produced by the amplifier will be divided evenly between the two subs, for 150 watts each.  Should be a perfect match, and it has some power in reserve if you decide to upgrade your subs later.
JXWC0fxPaa	A GPS is one of those nice-to-have gimmicks that we drivers are convinced we cannot live without. Personally, I prefer the tried n true paper map or online service such as google earth or msn virtual earth (both free downloads) with note pad and pencil. The first rule of driving is to know where one is going; the second is to know how to get there - before starting. After studying a map for a few minutes, write down your route, including alternate route details. If you have never been to a destination before, call ahead and get more specific info, including landmarks. The more you are prepared ahead of time, the easier the trip will be.<br>  <br>  If you have to have a GPS unit, check with Circuit City. They are going out of business and have very good deals on the products they have remaining. My wife has a Garmin and it is pretty good. Reminder - most GPS units are freeway based, meaning it tries to get you on the closest freeway - regardless if it makes you drive farther to get to your destination.<br>  <br>  All the best.

HpWmkhabaa	You not only have to remove the dashboard to replace the radio in a 96 Jeep Cherokee, but you have to remove the transmission and the oil valve. Only after you follow those 3 simple steps you can replace the radio.|`|FsT54qh1aa	You need the slide clips that go into the front of the radio (with the face off) that will loosen the head unit. You should stop by an audio shop and ask them to let you use a set or let you purchase a set.|`|0ZMudA8aaa	you only have to remove the instrument panel bezel.  This is the trim piece that covers the guages, a/c-heater control, headlight, etc.  There are about 6 screws, some that are removed straight down, that you have to remove, and the bezel will pull off.  Once you remove the screws, the bezel will pop out and you have to work it up and over the steering wheel easily to keep from breaking it.  A little diligence and it will come out.  As the other poster said, you need those flat removal tools to slip the radio out of the bracket, but the radio bracket itself removes with two screws (or plastic locks)  good luck!!

zruhNGKbaa	A) a motorcycle battery charger will not charge a car battery - even if it is on all night.  <br>  B) Clean the battery terminals thoroughly and tighten securely.<br>  C) follow the procedure below - and do not assume the battery is either fully charged or in good condition! :<br>  <br>  No Start, this procedure covers most makes and models.<br>  <br>  No Crank: Check headlights <br>  Headlights Bright – Try to crank – Click, no crank lights remain bright  = starter or solenoid. Verify by checking for crank signal at starter using a test light while assistant holds key in crank position.  Try thunking the starter lightly with a hammer while assistant try’s to crank engine if test light shows crank signal present at starter = bad starter. <br>  No Click No Crank – check for crank signal at starter using a test light while assistant holds key in crank position.  If crank signal is present starter is bad.  <br>  If no crank signal at starter check ignition switch and / or intermediate solenoid / relay on fender or firewall or clutch switch or transmission park/neutral switch. No power at ignition switch - check fuses and / or fuseable links.<br>  If headlights dim or go out when attempt to crank = weak or bad battery or bad battery terminal connection – clean and tighten terminals, if still no crank replace battery.<br>  Headlights dim or not at all – Battery discharged or bad. Charge battery, 30 amp charger 3 hours, 10 amp charger 10 hours, go back to top and start process over. While charging look for cause of battery run down, dome lights, trunk lights, glove box lights an so on.  <br>  <br>  IF you choose to attempt to Jump Start a car PLEASE follow the following precautions and procedure: <br>  WEAR SAFETY GLASSES!!!  Do not allow the vehicles to touch! <br>  Connect one end of the Red cable to either the (+) Positive battery terminal or the Red (+) Positive Jump Starting Post of the vehicle to be started. Connect the other end of the Red Cable to either the (+) Positive battery terminal or the Red (+) Positive Jump Starting Post of the vehicle providing the jump.  Connect one end of the Black Cable to either the (-) Negative Battery terminal or to a solid metal component, bracket, ect. of the engine of the vehicle providing the jump.  Connect the other end of the Black Cable to a solid metal component, bracket, ect. of the engine of the vehicle to be started – DO NOT connect to the battery terminal for the final connection (Explosion Hazard!). Watch for sparks when making the last connection – if NO sparks, remove the final connection and wiggle all three of the other connections then make the final connection again. When you get sparks when making the final connection it indicates that a good connection is being made, capable of carrying the load of charging and starting the dead vehicle.  When connection is complete, start the engine of the vehicle providing the jump start if it is not already running, and wait 10 minutes for the dead battery to take a partial charge.  After 10 minutes the vehicle being jump started should start normally.  If jump starting is successful and no obvious cause for battery to be dead (Head lights, dome lights, trunk lights glove box lights an so forth left ON by driver), the vehicle should be taken directly to a parts store for a replacement battery.<br>   <br>  Cranks - no start – Got fuel?  Check for Spark using a spark tester or spare spark plug. Spark ok (check all 3 or 4 coil packs if multi coil ignition system) Check fuel pressure – special gauge required on most vehicles – refer to factory specification for correct normal pressure and procedure.  No spark at one coil, normal spark at all others = bad coil or harness connection.<br>  No Spark at any coil – check crank and cam sensors (DRB Test) Check valve timing (belt busted?)  Full system DRB (Diagnostic Readout Box) analysis at repair shop.<br>  Hope this helps ?|`|Fsmji7XNaa	Starter bendix is bad or solenoid!|`|kIy2bdiraa	Sounds like a starter.  Sometimes starters can develop "dead spots" that's why it probably started good last time and not this time.|`|WLPCCj9gaa	If you have been hitting your starter with a hammer and it is not the old iron magnetic style, you probably ruined your starter. You most likely need a new starter, if you feel like its not it then disconnect the negative battery cable and disconnect the solenoid and clean the connections thoroughly and reconnect it, have someone jump your car if necessary.|`|VcVQSOS8aa	It is the starter. I have a 1990 GMC  K1500 that did the same thing. It would start sometimes and sometimes it won't start. Starters are around $60|`|aQKTSU8iaa	Check your starter solenoid.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	If it doesnt do anything when you turn the key, as long as there is power to the starter, then the starter is most likely faulty internally.|`|FsT54qh1aa	I would go ahead and put a liberal amount of dielectric grease (buy it at an auto parts store) on the positive and negative bolt ends that screw into the battery for a positive connection. Check the ground wire too and make sure it isn't corroded where it bolts to the engine block. Take your battery in to an auto parts store to have it tested while you are there too. It just may not have the capacity to hold a strong charge any more.<br>       If you ensure that the connections are clean and greased with dielectric grease....and the battery isn't the problem....you likely need a new starter or a new starter solenoid or an ignition coil.

ewbuVeTTaa	I agree with others,if he has no title, no money changes hands.  You do have some options though.  If he's not returning your calls, you can go to the dealership and talk to the guy and demand your title. If that doesn't work, you can get the address, write a certified letter demanding the title within X amount of time or further action will be taken. If a letter you write doesn't work, I would then call a lawyer and have him write a certified letter demanding the title and legal fees for the cost of hiring a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work and if you paid via credit card or Visa/MC debit, you could bring the car back to the dealer. Then I'd call the credit card company or the bank if it's a debit and ask for a chargeback explaining the situation. If that doesn't work and you paid by check and it has not been cashed, bring the car back to the dealership and stop payment on the check as stated.  <br>  <br>  If the check has been cashed or if you paid cash for the car, then what you can do it keep the receipt, copies of checks, a bank or credit card statement showing the amount and take it to small claims court and sue for the money back, legal fees, time off work if you can and court costs.  If you can prove to the judge, (usually no juries in small claims) that it's like you say it is, you should get the money back plus fees, time off work if your state allows it and court costs. <br>  <br>  I'd run a carfax and make sure the car is legal otherwise, if it is, you could also go to the DMV with the bill of sale, reciept and proof you paid for it and they might issue a new title based on that or pull the old one from their system if it was ever titled in the state you bought it from. <br>  <br>  If not, you can go to court, show the carfax report, proof of the money paid to the dealer and petition the court to get you a court order allowing you to get a new title from DMV if DMV won't do it themselves. <br>  <br>  If the car is not legal, give it back to them immediately, demand your money back or call the cops since it would then likely be a criminal matter. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Stop payment on the check that you gave him.

There are many dealers out there who deal cars they have bought with what is known as a salvage title.  These cars are hard to get a title for.  I would personally go to the dealership and if you have a lawyer, contact them immediately and have them place a friendly call to the dealership.  I bough a car two years ago, and less than six months later the dealership was closed and the owner was in prison.  He was falsifying information on his cars with a "CARFAX" that was pre-prepared. I ran the VIN and found out the car had been totaled in Pennsylvania twice and was a salvage title car. After about 1000 to my lawyer and some legwork on his part, I got a real title.<br>  <br>  Sorry this happened to you.  Word of advice to you and anyone who reads this NEVER BUY A CAR FROM A SMALL DEALERSHIP, NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE DEAL.  IT'S FRAUDULENT AND A CRIME, AND YOU COULD GET IN TROUBLE TOO!  BE CAREFUL!<br>  <br>  DoubleX|`|NlYGbqnkaa	When you buy a car from a dealer you never ever get the title. In your paperwork you i'm sure signed an application for a new title. When it was sold to you the tax is collected and paid to the state on your behalf. The state then processes the new title and mails it to you. This can take as long as a month and a half. If its a small dealer he probably doesn't take things to the state everyday not to mention they don't move really quick when they do get them. It is out of the dealer's hands if he brought the stuff to the state and probably is ducking you because he has already told you this and figures it will show up in your mailbox anyday.|`|ixbbbVtbaa	never pay for a car in full with out geting a title all you can do is take him to court|`|Fsmji7XNaa	No title no wheels!

aec47cc71252f516d87f2ad8eb31e4a7aa	I don't know about any infant seats like that. If you want an all-in-one seat though, I can help you there. I own a Safety First, Alpha Omega Elite. There are so many benefits to a seat like that. Number one: You only have to buy one car seat EVER. Save your money. No infant seat, then convertible seat, then booster seat. Its an all in one package. You only use an infant seat for not very long in the fist place. This seat does 5-100 lbs. Plus its super comfy for your little one with a lot more padding than a standard infant seat. Number two: You can buckle the straps with one hand, adjust the length of the straps with one hand, fold up the armrests with one hand, and recline the seat with one hand. You can also adjust the position of the headrest without taking off the straps and re-threading them. The only downside is you can not take it out of the car and carry it around. If you plan on using a stroller a lot, then that might not be an issue.<br>  <br>  This may not help you with what you are looking for in particular, but I hope it helps none the less.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	Don't get an Alpha Omega. It's not a very good seat for newborns and it only harnesses to 40 pounds, about when a child would be 2 years old and certainly not big enough for a booster seat. Plus it makes a very crappy booster. What you might want to go for is The True Fit by The first Years. It's 180 dollars at Target.com. It will fit a newborn perfectly, rear face to 35 pounds, and forward face to 65 pounds. You won't need to buy another car seat for 6 years. I don't believe there are any infant carriers that can be used one handed. With the graco ones, one hand has to hold the handle and the other is needed to unhook it from the base. Another good thing about that convertible is you don't have to take the seat apart to adjust the harness.
AA10137828	That will be fine, but if you look around you can probably find a stand for 50 bucks or less.

I bought one for $20.00 and sold it for $25.00 when I was done with it. Or get yourself some 2 x 8 or 2 x 10 lumber and build a frame to set the motor on. Use the size of the oil pan to decide the height and width of your lumber. It will work good for you.

Anything more is asking for trouble such as trany burning up, overheating of the engine, axle tearing up and so forth.  <br>  It is better if your axle is geared low such as a 4.10 instead of a 3.25 axle ratio.  And it is certainly better if you have a trany cooler and an oversized radiator to cool the parts that get the hotest.
4UBxVIYFaa	Your question is not easy to answer. There is but a small handful of actual manufacturers of tires.  We know the well advertised names, such as GoodYear, Uniroyal, Firestone, etc.  However, these companies manufacture many 'off brand names'  for various suppliers, to the specifications of those suppliers.<br>  <br>  So, even if the actual manufacturer is GoodYear, as an example, it does not mean that the 'Federal brand' tire is made the same as is a Good Year tire.  You can only inquire of others relative to their experiences with that brand name.<br>  <br>  I've bought off brands over the years, and some have been simply fantastic, and others I wished I had never bought.

hjDB62VGaa	Plastic body filler is ideally applied over a coat of epoxy primer. Why?  The epoxy primer not only provides corrosion protection, it grips the substrate better than any other type of primer. Plastic body filler is a very porous substance, it has the ability to hold moisture. This is not something you want next to your metal, thus, the coat of epoxy primer.    After any major imperfections are properly filled with the plastic filler, go  to your fill primer. This material will give you a nearly perfect surface, once properly sanded. Now is the time for a very carefull inspection of the surface. If any small imperfections are found, like minor pin holes, put your glazing putty into service. This material is designed only to fill MINOR imperfections. Sand smooth once more and apply a coat of sealer. You are now ready to apply color coats.    The proper order is: Epoxy primer                               Plastic body filler                               Primer-surfacer                               glazing putty                               sealer    Good luck with your project.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Last thing is glazing.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	Glazing putty is only to smooth small in perfections body filler comes way before it and the primer.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	its like the same stuff but used in different way small dent filler or bondo.. grazing compound as a finish its more of a cover up to smooth out any flaws left

JbZJo4Wmaa	well, im not getting a real good idea of your situation, but im going to take a good guess at it and hope i get it right.<br>  I believer what you are saying is that the rope broke and then the recoil pulled the rope in where you cant grab it. If this is the case, I can help. If you havent already done so, remove the recoil unit(where the rope comes from) from the engine.Depending on how long the rope still is you may be able to reuse it, but I would replace it.If it broke once, its on its way out already. I will describe the process of installing a new rope.You can get a new one wherever small engine parts are sold, at a dealer(but it'll cost you more there)or even your local hardware store.I'm not sure how long yours needs to be, but you can probably get a good idea from the old one. <br>  On the side of the recoil that faces the engine normally, you should see the end of the rope sticking through  and tied in a knot.remove this one by pulling on it. Now wind the recoil 5-8 times, or until it feels like there is a fair amount of tension on it,  in whatever direction will make it recoil and pull the rope back in. Once wound, either have someone else hold it there or clamp it in place. Now put the end of the new rope through the hole that the other rope came out of and feed it out the hole that leaves the recoil. Tie an good knot in the end so it doesnt pull completely through, then install the pull handle on the end outside of the recoil. Now let the recoil slowly wind up.If you do it too quickly you could hurt yourself. If it winds enough to pull the handle back down to the recoil, install on the motor and enjoy. If not, you will have to wind it a few more times.<br>  If you have a problem threading the rope through the holes, burn the end with a lighter.the loose threads will melt together and make it easier. Needle nose pliers will be a great help as well.

tBq6ZDZvaa	those little engines are junk once anything gets into them I know i used to be in the hobby for 10 years. You need to pull the back plate off the engine and look inside to see if the connecting rod broke if it did than you need to get a new engine. The next place I would look it the cylinder take the head off and look in to the cylinder if you see score marks on it than the engine it toast. Those engines only have two assembly's that move the crank shaft assembly (crank and bearings) and the reciprocating assembly (piston connecting rod and wrist pin) so their is not that much that can go wrong hear. R/C cars are not complicated to work on. Also in the future make shore that their is a faint smoke trail behind the car when it passes you the engine may have also seized up from over heating and running lean. Those engines have to be run a little on the rich side.|`|O6XvHm0Xaa	How hard was you running the car?
AA12094894	If that's all that's wrong with the engine then get it fixed. It's not the biggest or the most expensive job in the world to have the shell bearings replaced. They're only about ￡20 and at the very most 1/2 a day in labour costs to get it done. You could do it yourself its not very complicated. Drain oil, remove sump, slacken and remove big end caps, replace bearings, refit. I wish people would stop looking for "an easy way out" all the time. Do the job yourself, the only thing you got to lose is the cost of the bearings. If you screw up so what?, you were going to replace it anyway.|`|bkhvdfJxaa	replacement should save you some money...but the main thing is that some rebuilt motors perform less then before...unless you do some upgrades over the oem stuff...while the new used motor will perform close to or even better then before...|`|AHygXkmfaa	A good rebuild costs as much as a re-manufactured engine with a warranty. <br>  If you were happy with the performance of the stock engine, then you may as well get a re-manufactured engine with an install kit, from a reputable re-manufacturer like Jasper engines and transmissions. If you're looking for something with a little or a lot more performance, have your engine rebuilt with forged pistons and connecting rods, higher duration camshafts, etc, etc, at a reputable performance shop.|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	The cheapest solution is a salvage yard engine.

x7yKGaEDaa	Rob there is really good chance you wont need to do a lot of work on the newer Malibu's.After the redesigned malibu came out in 2004 with help from Saab there overall quality ,ride,comfort and safety has been one of Chevy's best selling cars.Most of the customers who buy the Malibu's in my dealership the last few years love the power and style of there cars.The Malibu's with the 3.5 liter 200HP engine and the models with the 3.9 liter 240HP engine owners like there cars better over the underpowered 2.2 liter 144HP engine.The 2006 model offers a LTZ model over the 2005.The LTZ is truly a great car with tons of factory options.Yes the power steering issues caused some problems in some models but the factory has come out with a good correction and this does not stop the fact the malibu is a great car to drive and own.Best of luck.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I own a 2006 Malibu Maxx. We have had replaced every single part of the electric steering system with the exception of the steering wheel itself. My wife will not drive this car and the dealer offered us a pittance when I tried to trade it in. So here I sit with a car that I can't give away and nobody in the house will drive it. GM's solution to all the problems; "Why don't you buy our $1700.00 extended warranty and we will look after you"<br>  <br>   I not so politely told them where they could shove the warranty.

It will give you a hotter spark, and you don't need to replace the points if you don't want to. What ends up wearing out on the points is the piece that runs on the cam. The voltage/amperage going across the points is almost nothing, so they never wear.|`|AA10137828	They will add some but I doubt it will be very noticeable.<br>  <br>  What it will do is eliminate points (that may be an added purchase) and improve reliability.

bPfXAHt8aa	it depends on where you're going fast. if you're doing a lot of stop and go, it's likely you're experiencing heat soak with your intercooler. this is where the hot air from the turbo doesn't have enough cool air blowing through the intercooler to cool the charge. hot air has less density, less dense air has less oxygen, less oxygen = less power.

GeOMJN4Daa	If the clutch dis-engages then you shouldn't have any air. If it doesn't they pumping it. If it dis-engages, then you have air in the line. You bleed it by pumping the brake pedal and holding to the floor then crack the bleeder screw. Repeat til there isn't any more air.

The only way to do it is to equip every vehicle with a transponder that contains the owner's info in code. Next, transponder readers will have to be installed every 1/4 to 1/2 mile on every road in the country. As the vehicle passes under or over the reader, it takes the data and sends it to a very large computer that will compile the readings from all the readers the vehicle passes.  Every 3 or 6 months, the owner gets a bill. This is the only equitable way to do it. Leaving it to a manual system would invite fraud and cheating. We wouldn't want that now, would we? But the way the government is spending money these days, who knows for sure?<br>  <br>  All the best|`|6Gfz125Paa	The idea is that this per-mile  charge is a replacement for the gas tax.  <br>  <br>  Currently, you pay about 30-40 cents in tax per gallon of gas you use, depending on where you live.  <br>  <br>  So if the gas tax is abolished and replaced with a mileage tax, it will come out to about the same.

qjg0g5WMaa	1Check that your car battery is fully charged before beginning these tests. <br>  Step2Move the gear to neutral if you are diagnosing a car with a standard transmission or park if you are diagnosing a car with an automatic transmission. <br>  Step3Apply the parking brake and make sure to stay away from moving engine parts as you proceed with these tests. <br>  Step4Disconnect the coil high tension cable form the distributor cap and ground it using a short jumper wire. <br>  Step5Ask your assistant to turn the ignition key to start while you listen for a click at the starter solenoid. If you hear a firm click, go to step 9 if you have an on-starter solenoid; go to steps 10 and 11 if you have a remote-mounted solenoid. If you hear a weak click or repeated click sounds, go to the next step. <br>  Step6Unplug the small control circuit wire at the solenoid terminal. If there are two small wires, disconnect the one marked with an S, otherwise check the wiring diagram for your particular vehicle to locate this wire. <br>  Step7Connect a jumper wire to the battery positive terminal. As you bring the other jumper wire’s end in touch with the solenoid’s control circuit terminal you should hear a solid click; if you do not hear any sounds or hear a weak or chattering sound, make sure the solenoid is properly grounded and there is no corrosion or other substance preventing a good ground. Repeat the test. If you still don’t hear a solid click, replace the solenoid. <br>  Step8Unplug the small control circuit wire at the solenoid terminal. Ask your assistant to turn the key to start. Using a voltmeter, test for voltage at the control circuit wire. If the meter reads 0 volts, there is an open in that part of the circuit preventing the solenoid from operating the starter. Locate and fix the open. <br>  Step9Ask your assistant to turn the key to start. Check for a voltage drop between the solenoid's battery terminal and the starter motor strap. The voltage drop should be no more than 0.2 volts, otherwise replace the solenoid. Make sure the battery cable is well connected to the solenoid. Remember, this step is only for an on-starter solenoid.|`|AA12261615	basically what you need to do is just take the starter off and have it bench checked,if your sure the relay is working then it has to be the solenoid on the starter,those trucks have a  simple wiring system on them and it very seldom causes any problems,the most problem you,ll have will be from the starter on it,i own a 91 model amd 93 and have been through this with both of them before,good luck.|`|AA11665535	Dodge man rules... he knows his stuff! lol
v4z760kIaa	I enjoy taking the Amtrak, as my display name should suggest. However, I have only taken short-distance trips through Illinois alone. Amtrak allows food and drinks to be brought on board. They do not allow smoking, thankfully. The person you sit with can be anyone. You may not even be sitting next to anyone at all. I'm used to being on trains where people can pick any seat that they want as long as the seat is not taken. If you're going by yourself, and the train is sold out, then you can expect to be sitting with someone. Amtrak trains have cafe cars, so you can go there and see what they have. If you're on a long-distance trip, such as Chicago to Seattle on the Empire Builder, you'll be dining on-board.<br>  <br>  Out of curiosity, which train are you taking?|`|Y5pgqBcAaa	It's a pleasant ride.I use to ride amtrak back and forth to work.The train was always on time.And even though I only rode it for about 20 mins,<br>  I loved it!As far as eating.That will depend on how far your going.I'm taking a train trip to florida in may,and we will be eating on the train from time to time.ENJOY!!!|`|DokexPyMaa	Yes I have. You buy the ticket and get on which ever seat in your cabin. You can sleep for extra money. The dining car is also extra money. The snack car dose not require to request it in your ticket. You just go to snack car and pay for what ever.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I have never been so lucky as to be able to, but would love it. Have  a great time.|`|FsT54qh1aa	Amtrak is fine. You can bring food on your own or they have a dining\concession stand in one of the cars usually towards the back but everything is overpriced. The bathrooms suck though. It's much better than a bus though.|`|3YiZ63OVaa	yes I took a cross country trip Amtrak once, it was very nice.  They have a dinning car where they serve three meals a day.  Usually you sit with however they put you next to, if your not traveling with somebody else.  Thier is usually maybe only half the seats full so their is room to spread out.  I would do it again sometime.|`|2EVoNHHbaa	Here's a link to a guide explaining how to best enjoy a trip on Amtrak.

ZTMjXz1saa	One is crazy to choose a legacy major airline (like United) over a place like fed-ex.  Fex-ex = job stability and good pay.  Legacy airlines definitely don't have the former.  Plus, boxes don't complain.<br>  <br>  You're reason to work for united is ridiculous.  Nobody listens to those announcements and nobody cares that you are a pilot.

With the recession instead of laying people off all the crew members decided to take a 11% paycut but there was no lay off.  I think that is great that the people that have been flying for Fed Ex for a long period off time would do that so the newer pilots wouldnt get laid off.  Shows alot of caracter for the older pilots there i dont think united would do that. If you can get on with Fed Ex i would not pass that up.|`|1Ib0cNmQaa	United has had financial problems in the past so Fed ex would be a better choice

AA11293043	Future Pilot, since when does an F/A-18 travel at Mach 3?<br>  <br>  Anyway, theoretically, a well-engineered enough net could catch the aircraft. You'd need some kind of mechanism to decelerate it gradually though. If you had a net strong enough to not be shredded by the aircraft without decelerating it (as the nets on aircraft carriers have deceleration spools, for example), then the plane itself will be instantly turned to French fries by the net. I guess the bigger question is, why would you want to? As in, what is the purpose behind the device?|`|zlPAVkUBaa	Yes, it could.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	At Mach 3... no<br>  <br>  500mph yes

Some states have it by distance from which it can be heard, but nobody will measure the distance. If a cop thinks it's too loud, that's enough.|`|AA10091004	I'm in Palm Beach county. It cannot vibrate or be heard by the car next to you when the windows are shut. You will get a ticket.|`|G9fTHtJfaa	I'm just guessing. A cop may pull you over if your music can be heard about 5 or more feet away. The thing that will give you away other than loud music is flickering lights, so make sure your lights don't dim when the bass hits. They can get you for DTP or a certain sound ordinance law. Just always look around and keep it down at stop lights and neighborhoods and you'll be fine.

But, it all comes back to the same old question: What can you afford, and which is more worth it to you. I don't know any specifics on the r8, but I do know I wish I owned one of their cars with the TDI in it, since I've owned VW diesels since 1981, with extraordinary performance in longevity, low repair costs, and extremely high gas mileage. BUT, even though Audi is (or was) owned by VW, yours is an Audi, and a 2009, whereas I currently drive a 2002 VW Jetta TDI, and I'm  sure the performance will be very different (hopefully even better than my Jetta TDI), and I can't predict repair costs, which have escalated across the motorworld's horizons, so, it all comes back to that question, or those questions I cited earlier:  What can you afford, and which one's worth more to you.  If it were me, I'd try like hell to keep the Audi, and I'd drive it sensibly, like I do all my cars (which end up lasting f-o-r-e-v-e-r and get extremely good gas mileage[of course I'm talking diesels again, here]).  But then, I've always preferred European imports over Japanese ones, even though I owned two earlier makes of Honda Civics (1974 and 1979) which performed excellently, and I bought my daughter a 2006 Honda Accord EX (her choice, not mine). It's just my preference.  I bought  my son a 2004 VW Jetta TDI, 5-speed, (his choice, not mine) and it gets the usual incredible gas mileage (in the 50mpg's). But, secretly, I hope  you find it within your finances to keep the Audi.  I'd love to have one, especially one of their TDI's.   God Bless you.|`|LkpVGIobaa	The Audi R8 is the 4.2 liter sports coupe that cost 125,000 dollars, usually a person who would purchase this car would not ask about insurance and maintenance cost.

hkLY035raa	A CVT drives like an automatic.  Its chief advantage over other types of trannies is that there are no steps from one gear ratio to the next - "gears."  It can sweep continuously from its lowest ratio, what would be first gear in a regular transmission, to its highest ratio with no pauses.  This allows the engineers to program the tranny and engine to work together to keep the engine in its most efficient range, or most powerful depending on how the software is set up.<br>  <br>  Chances are good that you'll be able to select a setting that will make the tranny eke out every mile per gallon, or another setting that will hustle it along with some verve.  Some CVTs have been sold that would emulate an automatic, jumping to preselected ratios, holding that as the engine revved, then jumping to another ratio.  That's silly but there it is.<br>  <br>  One complaint I hear about CVT vehicles is that sometimes they have a peculiar "disconnected" sort of feel, where the engine doesn't seem to be connected to the wheels.  As the loading changes on the tranny, the engine's rev rate will climb up and down while your speed holds steady.<br>  <br>  CVTs are more complex than manuals and so far as I've heard, not as efficient at getting the power from the engine to the wheels.  But they're more efficient than conventional automatics, so they're splitting the difference.  CVTs have been in production for about fifteen years now and while there are the occasional complaints like I've just described, aside from that they seem to be perfectly acceptable as a transmission choice in your next vehicle.|`|e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa	As far as you are concerned, the CVT is just like an automatic transmission. It's actually better for some complicated reasons that you don't really care about. Technically it has no gears so it never shifts. For this reason it can always be at the perfect gear ratio.  If you are interested in getting the best fuel economy out of your car, get the CVT. You don't need to learn to drive it. Just put it in drive and off you go.<br>  <br>  <br>  *<br>  CVT means Continuously Variable Transmission.|`|Tyh8DlYXaa	A manual gives you the option of what gear to put it in, it has a clutch. A C.V.T. is a Constant Velocity Trans. It is always in motion. It has variable speed based on rpm. No shifting, it does it for you.

Your engine is in dire need of rings, just for a start.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	take it easy on that old pulsar, you're lucky she runs, I don't see many of them out there anymore.  looks like yours is going to be leaving the roadway soon.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	probably revs went over 7k, so leaky rings, blown moter|`|WpAtF0MCaa	hmm... well you might have control launch actually, it doesn't let you go past a certain rpm, but it helps your take off as in the tires don't spin as much and you grip quicker. blue and black smoke huh?? idk about that one, if your car has been having troubles lately then i'd get it checked out.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	the smoke is an indicator that oil is blowing past your rings and igniting. its time to get a new car or spend some major bucks to overhaul the engine.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Blown motor, or piston rings.|`|vMthRkrsaa	Generally, White smoke means water, Blue smoke means gas, and Black smoke means oil.   Fuel may be sneaking past either a bad injector or a bad carb. (whichever you have).  inefficiently burning up and going out your exhaust. <br>  That may explain why the engine is not getting enough fuel to run over 4000 rpm.<br>  That is assuming you don't have any fouled spark plugs , bad plug wires, distributor cap, rotor, etc. and the timing is set correctly.|`|H3qYfp6Paa	When Blue smoke comes out of your exhust means that water is going into your engine and is burning water making it steam.<br>  <br>   and when black smoke comes out means that you engine is burning Oil and that is really bad. You probably broke your engine from the head gasket.|`|PJN3igF6aa	is there a check engine light? the motor wont rev high will be in "limp home mode" .... blue smoke is a sign of burning oil, black smoke is a rich condition if you are showin both than your car has a serious problem|`|z3ybCNcfaa	Maybe because its an old Nissan. My mom has a 1996 Nissan Quest (a van) that just has problems b/c its so old. Just consider you need to take it to the shop.
qjg0g5WMaa	miles are good but i'd be careful and do the research as some models of dodges had a habit of cracking heads and transmission issues try edmunds.com to find out what kinds of issues these dodges also the trucks have transmission issues and some wiring issues but 68,000  yea its worth $4000 here is a link for your code<a href="http://www.allpar.com/fix/codes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allpar.com/fix/codes.html</a><br>  goodluck|`|AA12261615	that's a real good buy on that car ,if  knew where that one was id by it for that price,if im not mistaken that's an intermittent loss of crank or a cam position sensor,it can also be a specific code for a manufacture specific data code which can only be defined by a dealer,so be careful on this one,those cars had problems in the wiring for the sensors which caused this code to appear,good luck.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Thats a very reliable car and a good deal.

7HDWtqhOaa	Well with a LT1 you are not going to get the mileage of a Honda, but if you build it right then you should match the F150, plus if the EL CO's rear end is stock gear ratio you should do well and having a OD trans wont hurt either. I just haven't got about an hour to type you a blue print and details on how to get mileage with a LT1, but it is possible. Or you could do what some friends of mine did but the Chevy guys will just puke. Put a toyota 22r and manual trans in it. No Joke. The guys in Fullerton Ca in the sunny hills area know what I am talking about, Right Rick P?<br>  Also you can try this guy's tune tips, haven't read it all but it looks sound. Send a e-mail and when I have time I will send you a build guide line, but remember you are not going to get 30 MPG, But I can get you close to your F-150, but it will cost money for the mods, my advise right now if free|`|dQrBlk4qaa	You are hurting my eyes with such sacrilege! Honestly, to take power out of a car!<br>  <br>  Seriously, if you're looking to do this, you could most likely go for a turbo 3.8 V6 Chevy. You'll maintain your power and get about 28 mpg highway if you keep your foot off of the loud pedal. <br>  <br>  For the price of this, though, why don't you consider getting a decent little 4 banger to putter around in, and keep your trucks for fun times? I keep my camaro for weekends and times where I want to scare the ricers, Then, for the mid week, I drive gas sipping 4 and 6 cyl commuters. If you have the space - take advantage of it!|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Sorry you drive a F150.....that sucks! Bet it spends most of its time in the repair shop. AH!!!|`|1c264470699c75f9ef21a75b4682539eaa	The LT1 is a very efficient engine with a couple of exceptions, first the factory quadrajet carb and intake spec'ed for a corvette will cost you at least 5 mpg, averaged for overall fuel economy. Secondly the cam for a 'vette spec'd engine is tilted slightly retarded-(for higher rpm performance). My advice is to change the cam/intake and carb to a more truck-like 250hp/high torque factory spec'd engine with a more city street friendly rear axle ratio of 350:1. This engine should idle perfectly smooth and need little touch to zoom you to 50mph. If all is correct, you will average a good 18 mpg and with the addition of a TBI feedback setup,instead of a carb, you should realize around 20 average mpg's without the a.c. compressor engaged.Warning: this combo will destroy rear tires fast! Perhaps a good and wide '50 series' tire may live a full summer of driving with a lead foot. A tall and narrow  all-season tire is best for winter driving-stay around the 235-275 mark with a 75 series tire. This engine is very tractable and forgiving of octane/blend changes. Be sure your radiator is up to snuff if you run an automatic trans.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	You have a beutiful vehicle there.  GM trucks always were  notorious for their gas mileage.  Find out from your speed shop what an econo cam would cost-It helps.  You could change over to a 305 cid with a 2 bbl  but you will lose a lot of get up and go-this set up with an econo cam at best will get you around 25 mph|`|6CyScIKBaa	if you want power id stick with the v-8 305 is smallest but they have cam problems take the 4 barrel off and switch to a 2 barrel but you will have to change intake|`|KRgfXsFtaa	The power comes with the V8. You play, you pay|`|JfhcfPFfaa	well try smaller engine or just drive it on the weekends and such like a After work to cruse around in....|`|9aa3974d6e3a58df61ffe6d9c9eaa029aa	I really don't believe so.|`|VauuLYHaaa	that is not the mentality of a tru car guy. sell it to someone that will use the damn thing|`|2VCYL0F3aa	smaller v8,v6 or in line 6 any of these will fit or you could put a smaller carb and intake on the one you have

AA11087517	Check out www.airlinepilotcentral.com.  It has pay scales for most airlines and they are mostly up to date.  Usually as an airline pilot you are guaranteed 75-80 hours per month.  You'll see it all depends on whether you are captain or first officer, what you are flying, and how long you have been with the company.  The first year at a regional you usually get between $15K and $25K as a first officer and top out at around $60K-$70K as a captain after you've been there a while.  The major and legacy carriers (Delta, American, Southwest, etc) usually pay the best, around $30K-$40K the first year and get upwards of $200K as a seasoned captain.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	When you start as a regional pilot, you will make around $15-55,000. After you move past regional, you can make from $30-240,000. This all depends on the plane you fly and seniority
cn0ALwwLaa	A few. <br>  <br>  Hooking a sub and amp up to the factory radio is done by making the speaker output from the factory head unit into an adapter, so they dont go just to the factory speakers. There is a piece that will let the amp input itself at this point, where the wires come out of it (for the sound signal) and go to a splitter of sorts, one of which will run to the amp, which is probably just powering the Sub, Could be wrong about that, I have heard of people powering their 6x9s and in-car speakers with amps.<br>  <br>  The antenna hook-up can be left alone, since its not a new head. Also no need for mounting brackets, or power adapters.<br>  <br>  After that, it is a fairly straightforward thing of setting up the cross-fade or cut-out or whatever it is called on the amp to pick up the frequencies you want it to boost, and some set-ups like this sound kinda decent.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you. These pieces are available at BestBuy, from my understanding. Go to a local store, though, they have less restriction and can do more to your car.

tr1Gtltyaa	First things first...does the car attempt to turn over?  Do you get a mechanical clicking noise only when you turn the key, does the motor try and turn over, or do you get nothing at all?  The clicking noise and nothing at all indicate something electrical (i.e., dead battery, low battery, etc.)  Trying to turn over without success brings us to the next step:<br>  <br>  Fuel, fire, and compression.  Test each one of these in order.  Are you getting gas to your ignition cassette?  Are you SURE???  If so, then test your fire.  Are your plugs properly gapped?  Are they worn out?  Is your ignition cassette faulty? Head on over to www.saabnet.com and look through the bulletin boards there for some advice on how to check for a bad ignition cassette.  Finally, if you've got both of these, time for a compression check as you might have some head gasket issues (all too common with Saabs).  You can test it yourself but your best bet, if you get to this point, is to take it a a mechanic (NOT a dealer!!!!)

lLZqNNUdaa	The people at the New Jersey DMV should have asked for your California license plates,and sent them back to California.   You are getting renewal notices because the California DMV people still think you live here, and the post office is forwarding the mail to your New Jersey address. <br>  <br>  Just send the notices back with proof of the date you registered the car at your new address and that should clear up that problem. <br>  <br>  PS: You got out of here just in the nick of time.|`|bIE0PTY3aa	You better ask a lawyer first.

bLjGM9yNaa	Yes, any repair shop can do this.  If it's just a matter of a lug nut<br>    which is stripped, you can do this as well. There are special tools<br>    that can remove a stripped lug nut. This way you don't need to go<br>    through the expense of replacing the wheel bolt as wheel.<br>  <br>    You might want to check with anybody who has a tow truck or<br>     a tire shop for this tool. You can even buy one but you will need<br>     to know the size, in addition, many places sell them in sets, and<br>     you really don't need to spend the money on a complete set.<br>  <br>     So back to the original problem. What is actually wrong with the<br>     lug in the first place ?|`|EMC7JwVBaa	You can do it. Break off the stud and replace it. Chiltons Auto Repair manual will show you how- it isn't so hard.

Its only a 15 minute job.|`|TqPpsGqvaa	First of all you don't just replace brake shoes , you must clean and replace the hardware kit [ springs and mounting pins ect. ] then you need to machine the drums to have two proper mating surfaces . With out doing the job properly your brakes wont last as long . If you have to brake a wheel stud it's not that big of a deal you can replace it when you pull off the drum . Any shop can do this . Brake are a safety issue and should be done properly . Think about everyone else on the road .
abnqs0jQaa	I am pretty sure you can just buy one online. I actually never noticed if they were different sizes or not, but a couple stores offer the product. I believe it is just a sticker type thing that goes over the silver logo.<br>  <br>  Try www.stateofnine.com - I would expect them to have both available<br>  Another source may be www.elkparts.com.<br>  <br>  Both these sites specialize in Saab products, so I'm sure they have these. I had the same problem on my '99 9-5, as the front badge turned straight silver after a couple years, however, I opted not to put a new one on; I thought it might just wear away again, but I'd check reviews for those two sites, and see what people's experiences with the replacement logos are.

This mandate is intended to help prevent problem drivers from “license shopping,” meaning a person would go to a different state to get a new driver’s license when their current license is suspended or revoked according to the NHTSA. Keeping problem drivers off the road is critical to the NHTSA's goal of reducing highway fatalities and injuries.|`|Fsmji7XNaa	They check from state to state so no!

kNJbZeCgaa	12 seconds is not difficult with the LT1, make sure it is in good shape, check the compression, if it is not, fix that, then change the cam to one of chevy's hot cams, install headers, low restriction air filter, and good tires, should put you very close, add nitrous if you want, keep it under 100 horse, use a dry system, very easy install, feather it off the line, rearend and axles should last longer that way, and go have fun, get a helmet and have fun...be safe.|`|8zVxYkluaa	First and foremost what's your budget?????  <br>  <br>  LT1's love nitrous.  You could get that T/A into the 12's easily.  First, start off with a cold air intake of some sort, a good catback exhaust, maybe headers...a 125 shot of nitrous..now some people like a dry kit, I personally like the wet kit better, WAY less room for error.  You'll also greatly benefit from a PCM tune.<br>  <br>  Is the car a M6 or A4?  If it's an A4 a good torque converter will net you some GREAT results as well.<br>  <br>  www.camaroz28.com    There are a good amount of LT1 guys on that site...if you have the mindset of using nitrous 12's are not hard for a LT1.  A 125 shot is a good shot, a stock LT1 will handle that all day long.<br>  <br>  Obviously you want to make sure the car is in good running condition before modding anything(plugs, wires, fuel filter etc).<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, what Jordan said about the rear...I wouldn't run slicks, I'd go no better than something like Nitto drag radials...unless you really want to be picking up axle and rear parts off of the track, lol.  Damn GM and their junk 10-bolt rears lol(well the 8.5'' isn't bad)|`|FsT54qh1aa	A 125 or 150 shot nitrous system and some sticky tires will be the cheapest way to get into the 12's.

Be prepared to replace the rear end with a 12 bolt sooner or later....because it will blow out eventually.|`|qGpD9ntNaa	The easiest and best way to add horse power to any motor is by upgrading the cam and the heads. Neither one is that hard if you know what you are doing. You are limited only by your budget. A set of aluminum heads will cost you any where from $500.00 a piece to $10,000.00 and you should be able to get a good cam for under $500.00 easy. <br>  If you make friends in racing circuits then they may be able to help you find used parts and save you tons of money.<br>  <br>  A good exhaust will help as well but if it is for drag racing a cool way to eliminate your back pressure is a set of electric exhaust cutouts. With the flip of a switch you can go form quit street car to drag strip loud with no resistance.<br>  <br>  I would not suggest that you do the whole K&N or Cold air intake the are just a bogus way to spend money that would be much better spent somewhere else. They don't really do anything for the performance of the car.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	Traction, traction, traction  is the key to the budget, low ET's <br>  <br>  Go ahead and spend the most part of the money on your suspension/chassis. It will net you more gains. <br>  <br>  I run a third gen (1988) which is the same suspension an all as yours. <br>  <br>  To start out with 5 years ago I built a 505 HP engine and dropped it in a stock chassis camaro.  I ran freaking high 12's, low 13's a 117 mph or so with 2.30's and 2.40's 60' times. <br>  <br>  Done nothing to the engine after that. <br>  <br>  Then re worked my suspension and chassis, added drag radails and ran 11.40's @ 118 mph with 1.60's 60 foot times<br>  <br>  Look into an aftermarket torque arm, lower control arms, control arm brackets, sub frame connetors.

7L0zp7O6aa	It means you are misfiring.  It's not good to drive it while it's flashing or you can do damage to your cats.  If you have an 02-05, that's really bad because you have a cat before the turbo and can do damage to both the turbo and engine if fragments of the cat get in there.  If you have an 06 and up, there is no cat before the turbo so not as big of a deal.  Many things can cause a misfire.  Bad MAF sensor, bad plugs or coil packs, bad injectors.  severely clogged fuel filter.  First thing I would do is get the code read to find out if it's just one cylinder or all.  That can kind of narrow it down a bit but if you don't have a code reader, you may just want to have the car towed to a shop to have it worked on.|`|DMDdkQqPaa	probably a severe misfire but i wouldn't worry about a blown piston just a tune up should fix your problem|`|FsT54qh1aa	That is usually a sign of misfiring.....which is probably a blown\smashed piston on a turbo car like that.

8ifKojOXaa	It could be a simple case of bad alternators but I'd be finding out if that vehicle has a built in voltage regulator or is it external.The ppl that sold you these alternators should know if the regulator is internal in the alternator or external, plus any dealership or alternator rebuilder can tell you.<br>   A bad voltage regulator or connection going to it or bad wire or rusted or corroded connection in the charging system could cause such a problem.<br>   One way you could try to find the problem is to actually have a mechanic try and run a full scan test over night on the vehicle bec that could pin point such problems if it is something , some device or circut or electronic part causing this problem.<br>   To me if it's not a faulty regulator or bad connection within the charging system , it has to be some kind of short some place , like maybe a bare wire rubbing or the battery itself has internal problems.<br>   Keep in mind that a lot of vehicles have voltage regulating circuits built into their comps , especially the main comp=PCM or ECM.If the main comp had internal problems or some kind of bad ground wire or connection either going to it or internally this could explain just why the alternators are going, plus it could just be that it's internal voltage regulating circuit is failing or faulty.<br>    Vehicles vary is design or the basic set-up but if you see a set of smaller wires running off the alternator towards the main comp these wires are for the voltage regulating systems.<br>   Also just bec a battery is tested and it tests good doesn't mean it couldn't have bad cells or a intermitent internal problem. Battery's with such problems could cause the alternators to short out or over work etc too.<br>    Any vehicle that age and that might be subject to extreme temperatures would for sure have corroded connections and if the starter had bad or rusty or corroded connections it could be draining the battery and over working the alternator or  just the corrosion a lone could be causing the electronic systems to act up etc.A lot of this type of work only requires a few basic tools and someone handy with vehicles that's willing to disconnect each connector one by one and clean them with small wire brushe etc. <br>    <br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way if you know someone handy with cars etc they could check all the grounds, especially going into the main comp, plus they also could check all the charging system's wiring from the battery , alternator , starter, engine block ground and the under the hood fuse box, etc or power junctions.With the right positive and negative led 12 volt test probe they could find out if the grounds have a solid connection and if all the 12 volt feeds etc are good and solid too.<br>   One last note I know this whole thing is driving crazy and costing you a lot of money but if you had one of these types of testers and a real good service manual with the proper comp pin layputs and function charts , plus displaying the grounds etc , you could pin point this problem much quicker .<br>   Keep in mind that on some of the newer vehicles if you go to buy or pull out a used comp like the ECM etc from a do it yourself auto wreckers it will be a lot cheaper but some due to the ignition security systems etc have to be re-programmed by the dealership.If you do have the type of comp that can be simply replaced with a used one be sure you or someone checks that the engine and vehicle features such as cruise control or A/C etc are exactly the same in your vehicle  and the vehicle that you want to remove the main comp from.|`|TwYPvhbGaa	Ive had alternator problems it could be simple as a loose or bad wire.

kNJbZeCgaa	this is not that big a deal, this engine is 3/4 ths of a chevy sbc 305, which is basically the same as small block chevys from 1955 forward-the good thing is that this can be done quite easily in the car, just remember this engine has a serp belt, so take note of where the belts go and how the pulleys are aligned with all the accessories.  DO NOT break the seal on the a/c unit, just take off the compressor and set it to the side, same with the power steering and alt.  Once you get through the pulley system, just remove 4 bolts on the front of the pump, remove it, you have already drained the coolant, and keep it, either reuse it or dispose of properly, remove the pump, and clean off the old gaskets from the front of the engine block.  Take the old pump with you, get one that is the exact same as the one you took off-do not allow the old pump to be taken by the parts store, buy an all new unit, not a rebuilt, and keep your old one until the new one is installed and functions properly-I know, I am probably overly protective, but many times I have brought home what appeared to be the correct pump, and it did not work, then I did not have my old one to look at to see exactly what i needed...good luck, as far as the paint, well, use a solvent to soften whatever is stuck to the paint, if it in fact is concrete, not cement as that is the powder that concrete is made from, then try a little vinegar, it is slightly acidic, will dissolve the concrete, and the spot can be removed gently, hopefully without chipping the pain-here is the good news, concrete does not chemically bond with paint, so you should have no problem...good luck, be careful.|`|VItj8zdAaa	why would you like to replace the water pump?  seems to me the factory warranty of 3 years 36,000 miles might apply unless you're over on mileage.  if you can email me, i will get you the procedure.|`|9a823d334bc2d11b63149434455399abaa	Go to your local auto parts store and pick up a Haynes Repair Manual.

It electronically controls the way the car accelerates to very quickly put down as much power as possible with little to no wheel slip. No human driver can work the car as well and some launch control devices. Some extremely high performance cars have it.

With out it the 300 will burn the right tire off.<br>  And you can't tell how fast a car will go by looking at it. The average driver can run 12.5's with the 300 letting it shift itself. But the average driver can't get the VW into the high 13's.|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	no it actually kills the engines power and applys the brakes on some cars. If you really want to launch a car you first need to learn what the car wants to do when you launch and you also have to learn what the best engine speed is to launch the car at. Also our Emissions standards are some of the most stringent in the world that's probably why most german and Japanese auto makers don't import their best cars and engines to the US because the engines won't be able to pass emissions. If they did get those cars to pass emissions testes than they would have much lower HP numbers than their European counter parts. its also why Domestic auto makes make better cars in europe and Japan instead of the US.

Think about your own actions before trying to reform those of others.|`|ef0b05a05f569f672b7884fd9ccd273baa	I grew up in a nice suburban white neighborhood just south of Atlanta, GA in the late 1970's and early 1980's. The houses, yards and streets were well maintained and cared for. The city of Atlanta at that time already had a significant black population. As a rule, most white people stayed away from downtown because of the high crime rate, prostitution, drug dealing etc. Atlanta has a public transportation system called MARTA. In the late 1980's MARTA began to extend it's services out of the city into the local suburbs. This gave access to these neighborhoods and businesses to people who historically were unable to go there due to transportation issues. I joined the military in 1986 and got out in 1990. I ended up in Charlotte, NC for job related reasons. I have lived in the suburbs of Charlotte since that time. In 2006 I returned home for my 25th highschool re-union. The neighborhood I grew up in is completely unrecognizable. The vast majority of the homes are run down and unmaintained. The city of Jonesboro is a shadow of what it once was. The local businesses are rundown. Many of them now closed not more of them. The car dealerships have moved. The nice restaurants are gone. The streets are littered. The crime rate, according to one of my old classmates who is a Captain in the city police force has increased by 100 times. All the home values have plummeted. The city government, now run by blacks is corrupt. The county school system, run by blacks is on the verge of losing its accredidation. (see Atlanta Journal Clayton County Schools)   The answer to your question.....I guess we have seen from our own personal experiences that if we allow buses into the area it will surley start a collapse of the social infrastructure. White people will move away because they do not want their children exposed to the black culture that denigrates the family values most of us are trying to instill into them. This in my view is not racism, it is a contempt for the exact lifestyle that Bill Cosby spoke of so eloquently several years ago.  In closing, it is not blacks that are a problem. It is the rapper, gangbanger, don't show me any disrespect, not being a father to your children, not helping your children with their homework, the white man is keepin us down attitude that is the problem. In the small town I live in outside of Charlotte, I would say 35% are black. We have a very low crime rate, our neighborhoods are all well maintained, etc. I go to downtown Charlotte sometimes to watch the Panthers play football. The black neighborhoods down there are a mirror image of Atlanta and Jonesboro, GA.
