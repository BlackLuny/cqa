20090128191949AAFBa30	Social Science;Economics	How would tax cuts help the economy?	Countries that are the happiest tend to have to highest taxes (i.e. Denmark).  If families are given tax cuts they are not going to spend any more money, they're just going to save what they get.  That's not going to stimulate the economy.  Wouldn't it make more sense to create jobs so families can use the money and put it in banks and buy stuff? I don't know I could be totally wrong.  I don't really understand how the republican stimulus plan would work.      Don't give me sarcastic answers please, just answer the question.      Thank you!
20090128195741AAkFQBH	Social Science;Psychology	Could the cry it out method lead to reactive attachment disorder?	Could the cry it out method lead to reactive attachment disorder?   Talking about babies under one...   I was reading my psychology book and it made me think about the cry it out method some people use. Babies naturally have needs- food- diaper change- sleep- love but when a baby is left alone in a crib it is not being shown any type of love. I am of course talking about the one hour crying sessions some books say to do. A baby's needs depend on the caregivers meeting the child's needs. Like a cycle, a baby will cry- caregivers will respond- the baby develops a trusting relationship. However, with the cry it out method- the baby will cry- caregiver will not respond effectively- the baby will not develop a trusting relationship.   Do you think the cry it out method could lead to detached child?
20090128190657AApzQ7Z	Social Science;Economics	How does inflation work?	What are the causes of inflation?

Also, how is inflation calculated? I hear things like 19%, 12%, etc.
20090128145830AApnQBo	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Heart attack (AMI) has been the leading cause of death for men and ladies for a long time...?	This modern Feminist, Deirdre O, seems to think that there was a "conspiracy" on the part of the medical community which led physicians to do a poor job in risk-stratifying and treating ladies using sound medical principles, in other words she thinks that the medical community didn't care as much about ladies dying as they did about men dying.       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Is it possible that AMIs (heart attacks) have long been known to present very differently in men versus ladies, i.e. the classic signs we see in men are seldom present in women.  As such, risk stratification is made that much more complex.  Men have rather classic symptoms of terrible chest pain, radiation to the jaw and left arm, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and so forth whereas ladies are much more difficult to diagnose.  Often they present with very ambiguous features that really don't point to a cardiac source.       http://www.circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/repr...       Do modern Feminists like this who have little to no hands on familiarity with the topic at hand lead to more public distrust of the medical community than good when they make spurious, historically and medically false claims about such serious things?      Should modern Feminists be trusted in disseminating bullshit to the public or should serious matters be left to independent panels of experts to deal with?

20090128144507AAYEzwa	Social Science;Economics	Is the Laffer Curve generally misunderstood?	I have heard people use it to explain why lowering taxes is always good, which is not what the curve represents at all.      I have heard others suggest that the Laffer curve is responsible for massive deficits, which is not correct at all as it only tied into revenue with nothing to do with expenses.      The Laffer Curve seems pretty straight forward to me, that there is a point of maximum tax rates that produces the maximum revenues, and if above this peak, lowering rates brings in more revenue and if below this peak, raising rates brings in more revenue.      Why is this so misrepresented and why is it not even accepted as a valid theory?

20090128202409AAbnT7r	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What could this dream mean?	Last night, I had a dream that me and three other friends went into the woods. and somehow I was really high, when I never smoked anything. [and i've been getting into alot of pot lately, so I've been dreaming about it, haha] but all of the sudden I was pregnant, didn't have a baby bump, and then like two seconds later I gave birth and it didn't even hurt. I was laughing through it, because I was super high. Then the baby disappeared, and somehow 2 days passed by. I was at my front door step and my mom was super mad at me for not telling her about my baby. Then she asked, "would you like to see her?". So I went inside and it was a baby girl, she kinda looked odd, but i can't explain how. And her name was rosemary. And she was already talking to me. I just don't remember the rest...

For instance, I missed a shift this last Monday where I work because I simply FORGOT.  Stupid, unexcusable, but true.  I walked out of the library today and FORGOT all my books and had to walk back and get them.  I forget peoples' names all the time, even after I have known them for quite a while.  Someone can be standing right in front of me, giving me information, and I will retain hardly any of that information at all because I just can't FOCUS on that person.  My mind is going in a million other directions.  (This may be in part that I am not very confident.)        I lock my keys in my car quite a bit, I forget the key to my room all the time, I forget about my laundry, I forget about EVERYTHING.  It makes me upset because should it really be this bad at my age, at 19?  I feel like I'm going to develop Alzheimer's or something by the age of 25 or something like that.  Is this abnormal?  What the heck can I do to improve my memory?  I have tried to write out schedules and such, but the thing is, I even forget about my schedules or planner.  I leave it in my room when I go to class all the time.      Please help!  This is kind of distressing to me... Is something wrong with me??

I cannot make friends even though I treat everyone as good as I can, it just feels like people find it a chore being around me.  Whilst I am at work in a supermarket when someone walks past me smiling its as if they are grinning at me, and when the workers stand with each other to talk they never involve me and it feels like they are joking about me behind my back.   And no way in hell can I talk very good with girls, they never see me as a guy they want to date nor a guy who they would even just hang out with or go for a drink with.  I am just existing and feel alone, and every time I try to dig myself out of the hole I end up even deeper, or so it seems  Also I have no hobbies, if I joined a group I would end up getting paranoid or bullied which ever one applies to me, if I went out of my to to change and it backfired I would end up feeling ten times worse which I am used to.

I look down at a text and it says make a turn when you see a yellow sign. i see the sign and start walking down this weird road. cars are driving by but then one slams it breaks. its a white car looks like a honda civic or toyota corolla. a man i have never seen before gets out and starts running toward me. i freeze and the man tackles me to the ground. he is stronger than me and takes control. he tries to rape me but i am kicking and screaming and after a while and my shirt torn off i get free and start running into a house. the whole time i have been screaming help but no one was around and no one came out of there houses. when i ran into one of the house it was like a maze i had to crawl through and i finally catch up to two unknown people and i am screaming for help but they don't even bother answering me i grab for the phone but then the man that tried to rape me caught up to me and started stabbing with a knife in the stomach over and over and over again. i call the police. they say help is on the way. they man is still there trying to rape me. finally help is there and its my mother and two sisters. they get me out of the house and into a car. and we drive away.      they dream just gives me a funny feeling.   and i didnt like it.   it felt so real and i just dont know what to think of it.      help?

20090225150840AAPOJEM	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Men: What do you think of this?	Is this a fair representation of the views of most men, or one sick, twisted individual? Would -most-men commit rape, if was legal as this man suggests?      "like any other crime, if rape was made legal the numbers would increase   ugly men especially would have a chance to have sex with very beautiful women they would not have had a chance to have sex before. Women will no longer be able to manipulate men because sex is available for free. When a man is horny anything is possible. (especially if rape is legal) Lot of young women would get raped.         A lot of feminists would not debate this with logic. Because it is very logically thought out and is the truth being a honest man who expresses his honest thoughts."      Men, what do you think of this assessment of men?

20090128181943AATgh4Z	Social Science;Anthropology	Are there any modern tribes that have been known to be hostile or to ever kill people?	Are there any modern tribes that have been known to be hostile or to ever kill people?   I heard about the explorer Percy Fawcett (who was looking for the remains of a city) who was supposedly killed by a tribe in the Amazon in the 1920's when he didn't have gifts for them. Now wheather this really happened to him or not, I was wondering if there are any tribes who have been known to kill or kidnap people today?         By the way I don't mean modern tribes as in tribes that have large amounts of outside contact like on indian reservations or anything, I mean more uncontacted tribes that aren't seen as often

20090128192354AAs9aLA	Social Science;Psychology	Help with lucid dreaming weird weird experience please read?	OK, so I was dreaming, right? And I've never become lucid before but I've been interested in trying lately. I dreamed that I was talking to one of my old teachers, and I was talking and I was all, "Yes, I'm actually dreaming right now. You're part of my dream and I'm becoming lucid." I looked at the clock on the wall as part of a sign to see if I was really dreaming and I looked at the clock and the time was 12:41. I looked again to see if the time changed because there are theories that state that words and numbers never stay the same in dreams. So, I looked again and the time said 12:41 still. So, in other words, my dreamsign that I was confident in didn't work. Can anyone tell me why? And also, after I looked at the clock I still knew I was dreaming but I just couldn't take it any farther. So, I need help about the clock thing, if anyone can help me!

20090128183849AAsMoiA	Social Science;Psychology	I procrastinate, help me!?	I know, I know. "Everyone procrastinates." But I need to stop drastically.  I am an average B student, and I NEED to become an A student. Emphasis on need.   So this is my personal case of how I procrastinate. If I start working, I have no trouble. At school I view it as work, so I'm always on task. But at home, I want to have fun, and I cannot seem to motivate myself just to start. After that, I'm fine. I could work for hours.   How can I end this habit? Thinking of the consequences doesn't help.

Is it bad just to run like the side of the razor down your leg? Because its not like I bleed or anything, is it bad to keep doing that? Please don't insult me you have no idea who I am or what I've been through.
20090128185357AALqHA6	Social Science;Psychology	How does cutting make you happy?	I cut and it makes me feel a lot better but I don't understand why? Is it because of endorphins or adrenaline? Don't tell me how stupid I am for cutting or that I should go to therapy. How does causing pain take away my emptiness? When I cut I get like an adrenaline rush and I just feel so much better like I can actually feel something. But why is this? Its like the only thing I can feel is the pain.

20090128191129AABLrlD	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should I still keep the distance between me and her?	I was close to her and other girls around her, since we worked together for all group assignments last semester.  It was ok, until she become rude to me. I gave her chances yet she did it over again…till I can’t take it anymore. I wondered why only me; then I noticed that other girls in the group have always been giving her the control. I do respect & be nice to her and everybody else apart of respecting myself, just that I’m more to take all of us as equal; nobody should be more or less..       Finally I could truthfully forgive her and took the chance by keeping my distance from her, hope she’ll learn a lesson. But the prob is, I can’t help it but to still stay away. There’s always this sign of “she’ll do it again” whenever I get a little bit closer to her. I just don’t want her to get used of being rude. To think goodly, she doesn’t seem wanting to do bad; maybe she just concerns a lot about others and thinks that her rude words could be a joke although they never really worked that way to me. I think she needs to fix the way she thinks about…everything, so that she can stop hurting others accidentally, while making words that come from her sounds positive and can be a real, casual joke. The other person I know who she has been treating this way is her bf (I totally respect him for his ultimate patience). I don’t hate her, in fact I feel very sorry for her, but I don’t know if she won’t do it again. I feel that a change takes a very long time, especially that I’ve given her lotsa chances but she never seemed to feel guilty about it.       She’s a trendy girl, full of ambition, self-conscious, the leader-wants-to-be, committed to her jobs, a confident girl who knows that she is confident, a goody goody type, not wild and thinks that she’s better than everyone else.       Ambitious and annoying, to conclude.        So, should I still keep the distance between me and her?

If a woman has a friendly conversation with a man he will mistake it as sexual interest.      Something simple as eye contact may make a man think there is interest from the woman when it was just really her catching him looking her way.      Or, he may be really "cool" with a woman and tell his friends that he is dating her meanwhile the women thinks and feels the total opposite.      So why do men "oversexualize" contact with women?      This is a question strictly about MEN, not about what women may or may not do!

20090128185320AARKpRQ	Social Science;Psychology	I used to draw nude woman as a kid. Is it a normal behavior for young child?	I used to draw, and I still draw every thing all the time, but now I remember that as a little kid I used to draw nude woman, now I do it in the art academy, and it's like school work, but then… is it normal for a young kid? It all started way back when I was in kinder garden, I saw a picture of a nude woman in the barber shop back room and when I came home I drew nude woman, and knew to hide it from my parents.    And in kinder garden me and few friends, used to try to look under girls skirts.   When I was a bit older, maybe on the third grade, I found a stash of adult magazines and started to draw them. And it was way before I really new what sex is and all that.   I even used to skip gym class to draw nude woman in hiding… was I a perverted kid? I mean I wasn't yet a teenager and most boys hate girls, and ever since I remember my self I liked girls, even today I have only one male friend, the rest are girls.     By the way I still draw some sexy pinups from time to time, but not in the same enthusiasm I did then.

It's so weird, coz i haven't been there since 2000 when i was about 11yrs old going on 12. in my dreams, i keep dreaming about the people that i was close to when i was there. The setting is the property where my grandma lives.      when i was there, i was very close to my mom's god son-we were like best friends. *i think he's 3-4yrs older* (we're not related, he's the son of the nanny that my mom had when she was young) anyways, him and his family live on my grandma's property. so i saw him every single day when i was there. *i was there for a month* anyways, i developed strong feelings for him. that i wasn't sure if i was in love with him or not since i was only 11. i didn't tell him how i felt, but i had the vibe that he might have felt the same.      anyways, the dream i had last month, he was in it, and it seemed like we were pretty close. and last night, i had a dream that he has kissed me. and it felt so real. it was as if i can feel his kiss.      what could this mean. having 2 random dreams about the phillippines? could it be that i miss him? or that he's thinking of me?

I'm a nice girl, who is sort of a sl*t/atheist/b*tch when I come on here to answer questions. Just for fun, I just end up answering from that angle, I don't know why, it just comes out that way. Maybe that's my true self deep down?-jk!       Sooo, are you just exactly in real life the same way as when you answer questions on YA, or is there some small differences, are you meaner on here, or do you in some way show a side that you do n't show elsewhere- on the job, or with the people you see on a day-to-day basis. I find it's easier for some their dark side when it's anonymous. Well, what do you feel you do differently?

20090128194830AAwNHHR	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Blanketed stereotypes depressing or what?	Wow, I find this section depressing.  So many fingers pointing making generalized stereotypes about men and about woman.    Then what's worse is SOME men and woman actually live up to the stereotype.    For example, all feminists, in fact in the "real world" MOST FEMINISTS are NOT man haters.  But why does it seem so here?    To balance the scale   ALL MEN or even MOST are NOT threatened by or angry at woman who call themselves feminists in the 'real world' but why does it seem so here?    I will make one general blanketed statement:  Some people in this section need to relax and get real.  You cannot blame an entire sex or gender for your personal issues in life.  Well, you can, but you will be missing out on reality and some enjoyment of dealing with the opposite sex on a realistic level.    Who's with me?

20090128195631AAsHU9K	Social Science;Psychology	Overactive Imagination?	I make up and enjoy intricate fantasies I play out in my head. I make up situations that play up personality traits that most people do not get to see because I am shy. These fantasies are very realistic and play in my head like a movie, a lot of times I will make up a fantasy to a song and then play out that fantasy a bunch of times until a new one comes along. These fantasies aren't freaky in nature, they are just things like dancing with my boyfriend at a regency ball or being a rock star. I absolutely love pretending and imagining....however I am in my 20's and it is my goal in life to write a book. Every once in a while these feelings make me feel abnormal does anyone else do this?

After I walk for a long time I come to this bright green, dome shaped hut like place. It is alive with color. I look at it for a few minutes, cause it is so out of place. As I stand there, this young man comes out of the hut and holds his hand out to me (I never see his face, but I know who he is.  Even when I wake up I still know who he is.)    I place my hand in his and he takes me in to the hut. He helps me set in the back of the hut, and he sets directly across from me in the front by the door. There is something in the middle on the floor, but I cant see what it is, it is  something warm because we set around it and I’m not cold anymore. He never lets go of my hand, and we set and look at each other. We are talking but not with our voices, it’s more with our minds. The longer we set there, the closer we get to each other, and by the end of the dream we are setting side by side, my hand still in his.
